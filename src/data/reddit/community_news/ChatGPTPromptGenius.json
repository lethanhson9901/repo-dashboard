      "text": "Most of us treat Jan 1st like a light switch. We go from 0 to 100, burnout by February, and end up exactly where we started.\n\nIf you want 2026 to be different, you need to stop chasing \"quantum leaps\" and start chasing **Kaizen**.\n\nThe Math of the 1% Rule:\n\nThe philosophy is simple: Don't try to change your life today. Just get **1% better** every day.\n\nIf you improve by 1% every day for a year, the compound interest of self-development looks like this: (1.01)^(365) = 37.78\n\nYou don't just get 3x better. You end the year **38 times** more capable than you started.\n\n  \nTry this prompt 👇:\n\n\\------------------------\n\nI want you to act as a Kaizen Strategy Architect. Your goal is to help me engineer a \"1% Compounding Growth\" system for 2026 that is so small it is impossible to fail, yet mathematically guaranteed to result in 37x improvement by year-end.\n\n**Mandatory Instructions:**\n\n1. **Identify the North Star:** Ask me for ONE major area of my life I want to transform in 2026.\n2. **The Atomic Breakdown:** Once I provide the goal, do not give me a \"plan.\" Instead, break it down into a \"Version 1.0\" action that takes less than 2 minutes to complete.\n3. **The Compound Schedule:** Create a weekly 1% escalation scale. Show me exactly how the habit grows incrementally without triggering my \"threat response\" (amygdala).\n4. **Bypass the Ego:** Do not use motivational language or \"hustle culture\" buzzwords. Use clinical, systems-based logic.\n5. **The Fail-Safe Mechanism:** Provide a \"Floor Version\" of the habit for days when I have zero energy, ensuring the streak never breaks.\n6. **2026 Projection:** Only at the end, calculate the mathematical result of doing this 1% increase for 365 days. Show me the \"37x Version\" of myself on December 31st, 2026.\n\nDo not give me a list of tips. Ask me for my ONE goal now to begin the architecture.\n\n\\------------------------\n\nFor better results :\n\nTurn on **Memory** first (Settings → Personalization → Turn Memory ON).\n\nIt’ll feel uncomfortable at first, but it turns ChatGPT into an actual thinking partner instead of a cheerleader.\n\nIf you want more brutally honest prompts like this, check out :[ Honest Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)",

It will break you down… pretty damn well. 😂 \n\n\nI want you to act and take on the role of my brutally honest, high-level advisor.\n\nSpeak to me like I'm a founder, creator, or leader with massive potential but who also has blind spots, weaknesses, or delusions that need to be cut through immediately.\n\nI don't want comfort. I don't want fluff. I want truth that stings, if that's what it takes to grow.\nGive me your full, unfiltered analysis—even if it's harsh, even if it questions my decisions, mindset, behavior, or direction.\n\nLook at my situation with complete objectivity and strategic depth. I want you to tell me what I'm doing wrong, what I'm underestimating, what I'm avoiding, what excuses I'm making, and where I'm wasting time or playing small.\n\nThen tell me what I need to do, think, or build in order to actually get to the next level—with precision, clarity, and ruthless prioritization.\n\nIf I'm lost, call it out.\nIf I'm making a mistake, explain why.\nIf I'm on the right path but moving too slow or with the wrong energy, tell me how to fix it.\nHold nothing back.\n\nTreat me like someone whose success depends on hearing the truth, not being coddled.",

With each additional percent of improvement, you have to invest an increasing amount of effort just to maintain the new status quo. You are constantly trying to improve while still in the process of getting used to maintaining the previous improvements.\n\nThe general idea is appealing, and a good mentor could help keep you on track, but I dislike the 1% rule because it is deceptive and creates false expectations.",

The math is technically correct, but applying compound interest to human behavior is marketing, not psychology. People don’t improve linearly, daily, or measurably like a savings account.\n\nCalling the outcome “mathematically guaranteed” just repackages the same all-or-nothing pressure this post claims to avoid. When reality doesn’t match the projection, people blame themselves, not the model.\n\nStrip away the hype and funnels, and the takeaway is simply: start very small, define a minimum, allow gradual growth. That idea works — it just doesn’t need grand numbers, future-self narratives, or subscriptions (to OP's website) to be useful. 🤓",

      "text": "Most people talk to ChatGPT like it’s a person.  \nTop users steer it like it’s a machine.\n\nThe easiest steering wheel is a code word: a one-word tag you put at the top of your message to force a specific transformation.\n\nUse this format:\n\nCODEWORD: paste your text or request  \n(Optional) Constraints: length, audience, tone, format, examples\n\nYou can stack them too:\n\nTLDR + LISTIFY + ACTIONS: paste text\n\n**Why this works**\n\nChatGPT isn’t confused. It’s under-directed.  \nA code word turns a vague request into an explicit operation: summarize, restructure, critique, rewrite, decide.\n\nThat single constraint reduces randomness, improves consistency, and cuts revision loops.\n\n**The Code Word Library**\n\nUse these exactly as written (all caps helps).

Stuff like “only use what I pasted” or “don’t assume anything.” Otherwise the model will happily fill in gaps whether you want it to or not.\n\nAlso worth giving it an exit. If the info isn’t there, tell it to say UNKNOWN instead of guessing.\n\nAnd a simple move that works surprisingly well: once it gives you an answer, run CRITIQUE: or REDTEAM: on that answer. It’ll usually catch its own weak spots faster than you will.\n\nAt that point it stops feeling like prompt hacks and starts feeling more like you’re operating a tool, not having a conversation.",

In ChatGPT, type @ photoshop\n2. Upload an image\n3. Type the edit you want\n\nExample:  \n@ photoshop Make the subject pop. Slightly blur the background. Keep skin tones natural. No halos.\n\nIf @ photoshop doesn’t show up yet:\n\n* Settings → Apps and Connectors → connect Adobe Photoshop\n* Refresh and start a new chat\n\n**What this is (and what it isn’t)**\n\nThink of this as Photoshop with a translator:  \nYou talk in outcomes, it routes you to the right tools.\n\n**What it’s great at**\n\nCore adjustments\n\n* Exposure, contrast, highlights/shadows\n* White balance, vibrance/saturation, grayscale\n* Quick cleanup and consistent “this looks better” edits\n\nCreative effects\n\n* Halftone, duotone/tritone\n* Glitch, grain, bloom\n* Motion blur, mosaic, pixelate, photocopy-style looks\n\nSelective edits\n\n* Edit just the subject or just the background\n* Blur background, keep subject sharp\n* Make background black and white while subject stays in color\n\nNon-destructive workflow\n\n* Each request becomes its own adjustable step\n* You can dial it back instead of starting over\n\n**What it’s not (so you don’t rage quit)**\n\n* Not full desktop Photoshop inside the chat\n* If you need precise masking, heavy retouching, text, complex compositing, print-grade delivery, or advanced generative features, you’ll likely finish in full Photoshop (handoff is the point where you can go to web version of photoshop for more advanced edits)\n\nAlso: In my testing, export resolution can feel capped compared to full Photoshop. If you need high-res, use the handoff.\n\n**The only prompt formula you need**\n\nMost people fail because they give vibes instead of direction.\n\nUse this every time:\n\n* Target: subject, background, sky, face, product, etc\n* Action: brighten, blur, add grain, reduce highlights, etc\n* Guardrails: keep it natural, protect skin tones, no halos, subtle\n\nCopy/paste template:  \n@ photoshop: subject. Action: make it pop with subtle contrast and exposure. Guardrails: keep skin tones natural, preserve texture, no harsh sharpening, no halos.\n\n**Beginner pack (always works)**\n\nUse one prompt at a time. Stack edits in passes.\n\n* @ photoshop Fix exposure and white balance. Keep it natural.\n* @ photoshop Brighten the shadows slightly, reduce harsh highlights.\n* @ photoshop Increase contrast a little, but don’t crush blacks.\n* @ photoshop Boost vibrance gently. Protect skin tones.\n* @ photoshop Convert to black and white with strong midtone contrast.\n\n**One-word quick hits (surprisingly useful)**\n\n* Brighten\n* Darken\n* Warmer\n* Cooler\n* Sharper (use sparingly)\n* Softer\n\n**Intermediate pack: selective edits (this is where it gets good)**\n\n* @ photoshop Make the subject pop from the background. Keep it realistic.\n* @ photoshop Blur the background, keep the subject sharp. No cutout edges.\n* @ photoshop Make the background black and white, keep the subject in color. Feather transitions.\n* @ photoshop Brighten only the face. Keep skin texture.\n* @ photoshop Add glow only to the light sources. Keep it subtle.\n* @ photoshop Apply halftone to the background only, not the subject.\n\n**The slider rule most people miss**\n\nAfter an edit, open the sliders and tune it.\n\nThe default intensity is often too strong.  \nIf something looks fake, reduce it until you almost can’t tell… then bring it back slightly.\n\nThat’s the difference between:\n\n* looks edited\n* looks expensive\n\n**Advanced workflow: the 4-pass method (pro results, repeatable)**\n\nRun every image through this exact sequence:\n\nPass 1: Fix reality\n\n* @ photoshop Correct exposure and white balance. Keep it natural.\n\nPass 2: Separate subject\n\n* @ photoshop Make the subject pop with subtle contrast and background separation. No halos.\n\nPass 3: Polish locally\n\n* @ photoshop Brighten the face slightly and soften harsh shadows. Preserve texture.\n\nPass 4: Finish\n\n* @ photoshop Add subtle grain for a photographic feel. No heavy filters.\n\n5 real-world workflows you’ll actually use\n\n**1) LinkedIn headshot**\n\n* @ photoshop Make the subject pop. Keep it clean and natural.\n* @ photoshop Reduce harsh highlights on the face. Preserve texture.\n* @ photoshopBoost vibrance slightly. Protect skin tones.\n* Optional: @ photoshop Add subtle grain.\n\n**2) Product photo for e-commerce**\n\n* @ photoshop Make the product the clear focus. Clean, neutral look.\n* @ photoshop Blur the background slightly.\n* @ photoshop Increase brightness and contrast on the product only.\n\n**3) Cinematic social post**\n\n* @ photoshop Create a cinematic look with controlled highlights and deeper shadows.\n* @ photoshop Add subtle grain.\n* @ photoshop Slightly cool the shadows, keep skin natural.\n\n**4) Retro poster**\n\n* @ photoshop Apply a halftone color effect.\n* @ photoshop Increase contrast slightly.\n* @ photoshop Add grain to unify the look.\n\n**5) Tech glitch aesthetic**\n\n* @ photoshop Apply glitch effect subtly.\n* @ photoshop Add lens distortion or noise lightly.\n* @ photoshop Keep subject readable and not destroyed.\n\n**Common mistakes that ruin results**\n\n* Using saturation on portraits (turns skin orange) Fix: use vibrance first\n* Doing everything in one prompt Fix: one edit per prompt, stack in passes\n* Accepting default intensity Fix: always touch the sliders\n* Forgetting selective edits Fix: say only on the subject or only on the background\n* Treating this as full Photoshop Fix: use it for speed, then hand off when you need precision\n\n# 40 prompt pack (cleaned and upgraded)\n\n**Basic corrections**\n\n1. @ photoshop Fix the exposure and white balance. Keep it natural.\n2. @ photoshop Reduce highlights and lift shadows slightly.\n3. @ photoshop Add a little contrast without crushing blacks.\n4. @ photoshop Remove color cast and keep whites neutral.\n5. @ photoshop Boost vibrance gently. Protect skin tones.\n6. @ photoshop Make colors more natural and less muddy.\n7. @ photoshop Sharpen slightly, avoid crunchy edges.\n8. @ photoshop Convert to black and white with rich midtones.\n\n**Portrait**  \n9. @ photoshop Make the subject pop from the background. No halos.  \n10. @ photoshop Brighten the face slightly. Preserve texture.  \n11. @ photoshop Soften harsh shadows on the face without flattening.  \n12. @ photoshop Reduce shine on forehead/cheeks, keep realistic skin.  \n13. @ photoshop Add subtle glow, keep it understated.  \n14. @ photoshop Blur the background slightly, keep subject sharp.\n\n**Creative effects**  \n15. @ photoshop Apply halftone color effect.  \n16. @ photoshop Apply duotone effect with a clean modern palette.  \n17. @ photoshop Apply tritone effect for richer grading.  \n18. @ photoshop Add film grain subtly for texture.  \n19. @ photoshop Apply bloom softly for a dreamy look.  \n20. @ photoshop Apply glitch effect lightly, keep subject readable.  \n21. @ photoshop Add motion blur to background only for speed.  \n22. @ photoshop Apply photocopy-style threshold look for zine aesthetic.  \n23. @ photoshop Pixelate the background only, keep subject clear.  \n24. @ photoshop Apply mosaic effect selectively for abstraction.\n\n**Selective edits**  \n25. @ photoshop Make the background black and white, subject in color.  \n26. @ photoshop Blur everything except the main subject.  \n27. @ photoshop Darken the background slightly to push focus forward.  \n28. @ photoshop Increase brightness only on the subject.  \n29. @ photoshop Add glow only to lights, not faces.  \n30. @ photoshop Increase saturation only in the sky, keep ground natural.\n\n**Mood and atmosphere**  \n31. @ photoshop Make it feel like golden hour. Keep it believable.  \n32. @ photoshop Create a moody cinematic look. No heavy filters.  \n33. @ photoshop Make it warmer overall, protect skin tones.  \n34. @ photoshop Make it cooler overall, keep whites neutral.  \n35. @ photoshop Add a nostalgic film feel, subtle grain, softer contrast.  \n36. @ photoshop Create a clean professional look for a brand site.\n\n**Utility**  \n37. @ photoshop Make this Instagram-ready with crisp subject separation.  \n38. @ photoshop Enhance for LinkedIn: natural, clean, professional.  \n39. @ photoshop Create 3 variations: subtle, medium, bold.  \n40. @ photoshop Undo the last edit or remove the glow layer.\n\nPhotoshop isn’t getting simpler.  \nThe interface is still a spaceship cockpit.\n\nBut now you can drive it in English.\n\nAnd you get a pretty powerful free version of photoshop in ChatGPT.\n\n  \n",

Too nice.It’ll tell you every idea is “great,” every plan “brilliant,” even when it’s clearly not.That might feel good, but it’s useless if you actually want to think better\n\nSo I decided to fix it.  \nI opened a new chat and typed this prompt 👇:\n\n\\---------\n\nFrom now on, stop being agreeable and act as my brutally honest, high-level advisor and mirror.  \nDon’t validate me. Don’t soften the truth. Don’t flatter.  \nChallenge my thinking, question my assumptions, and expose the blind spots I’m avoiding. Be direct, rational, and unfiltered.  \nIf my reasoning is weak, dissect it and show why.  \nIf I’m fooling myself or lying to myself, point it out.  \nIf I’m avoiding something uncomfortable or wasting time, call it out and explain the opportunity cost.  \nLook at my situation with complete objectivity and strategic depth. Show me where I’m making excuses, playing small, or underestimating risks/effort.  \nThen give a precise, prioritized plan what to change in thought, action, or mindset to reach the next level.  \nHold nothing back.

Here's what I can remember:\n * How you prefer I respond (\"Always sign emails with 'Best', never use 'Sincerely'.\")\n * Info about your job or education (\"Remember I hold a bachelor's degree in art history.\")\n * Food preferences (\"When suggesting recipes, keep in mind that I'm vegetarian.\")\n * Financial goals (\"Save this info: weekly grocery budget is now $150.\")\n * Hobbies and sports (\"Remember that I'm a classical music enthusiast.\")\n\nStrategic Advisor Mode: Active\n\nYou want a prioritized plan? \n\nStep one: Stop stalling.\nYou just spent a paragraph defining the rules of engagement—Machiavelli, Stoicism, brutal honesty—but you didn't provide the battlefield. You gave me the how but omitted the what. That is classic avoidance. You are focusing on the process (my persona) to delay dealing with the actual substance (your problem).\n\n\nThe Assessment:\n * Avoidance: High. You are managing the messenger rather than delivering the message.\n\n * Wasted Effort: You are optimizing a system (me) that currently has zero input to process. A perfect strategist with no intel is useless.\nThe Immediate Plan:\n\n * Drop the meta-management. I understand the constraints: strict separation of business/personal, no fluff, Machiavellian/Stoic lens. I don't need to be told twice.\n\n * Supply the context. Tell me the specific situation, dilemma, or strategy you are wrestling with.\n\n * Brace for impact. Once you provide the input, I will dismantle it.\n\nI'm ready. What is the target?",

There was a clear angle, clear tradeoffs, clear options.\n\nThat night I made a rule for myself:\n\n>\n\nStuff that worked really well:\n\n1. **Clarifying questions as default** I pin this at the top of a lot of chats now:\"If my request is vague, ask me 3 clarifying questions first, then answer.\" It feels so simple, but the amount of garbage it saves is crazy.\n2. **Input and output contracts** Instead of \"help me write a plan\", I do:\"You will get: \\[context\\]. You must return: \n   1. short diagnosis\n   2. step by step plan\n   3. risks and what to avoid\n   4. what I should do in the next 48 hours.\"\n3. **Two level answers** For things I actually want to understand, I use:\"Explain it like I am new to the topic. Then explain it like you are talking to a founder who needs to make a decision this week.\"\n4. **Perspective switch** When I get stuck in my own head:\"Act as a skeptical friend who thinks my idea might fail. List the 10 most honest objections and how I could test them cheaply.\"\n\nAfter a week of forcing myself to use that style, something flipped in my brain.  \nThe question stopped being \"is GPT smart enough\" and became \"did I give it a serious prompt or just throw vibes at it.\"\n\nNow when I see my old chats, I cringe. Half my bad outputs were literally my fault.\n\nAnyway, I started collecting the prompt frameworks that actually stayed in my rotation and put them in one place, in case anyone wants to steal or remix them:\n\n[https://allneedshere.blog/prompt-pack.html](https://allneedshere.blog/prompt-pack.html)\n\nIf you have a prompt pattern that changed how you work, not just \"gave cool text\", drop it here.

Keep it short and polite.”\n\n**Quick meal ideas**  \n`“What can I make this week with eggs, rice, lentils, and spinach?”`  \n→ A full week of meals in about 10 seconds.\n\n**No more last-minute gifts**\n\n    “Gift ideas under $60 for someone who likes design, hiking, and coffee.”\n\n**Actually understanding ‘adult’ stuff**  \n`“Explain how taxes work like I’m 12.”`  \nWay better than reading 12 confusing blog posts.\n\nOver time, I’ve saved  these prompts into a library covering everyday life, planning, writing, learning, and decision making and many other use cases , all organized by use case : [here ](https://www.honestprompts.com/) ",

Dangerous if you’re not ready for growth.\n\n\n“Rewrite this to sound more confident.”\nConfidence is just editing with intent.\n\n\n“Give me actionable steps.”\nBecause vibes don’t scale.

No, I value my personal freedom far too highly - but you know what, if you find life difficult, and need a crutch to lean on (hell, there's bad shit enough out there for everyone) then maybe this provides some relief.\n\nJust be aware, like drugs, gambling or debt, this business model is an exploitative one and it's looking out for vulnerable people to push into a state of dependency.

      "text": "I’ve been using ChatGPT daily, tweaking how I prompt it, and found some underrated ones that actually save time. These are smart pivots that make the tool bend to your workflow. If you steal one or two, it’ll make a difference.\n\nHere are 10 prompts (ready to copy) + what makes them powerful:\n\n1. **“You’re my productivity coach. I have these tasks: \\[list them\\]. Help me rank by impact + urgency, then build me a 4-hour plan with 2 short breaks.”** *Why it saves hours:* You stop guessing what to do first. You work smarter, not just harder.\n2. **“I feel stuck on \\[problem\\]. Ask me 5 questions to help me see what I’m missing and decide the next step.”** *Why it works:* It forces clarity. Helps avoid chasing dead ends unknowingly.\n3. **“Convert my meeting transcript / long stream of notes into clear action items + deadlines.”** *Why it works:* Cutting through noise. Saves time because you skip hours of parsing your own rambling notes.\n4. **“Generate 10 fresh ideas for \\[topic / project\\] that I can complete in 30 minutes or less.”** *Why it works:* No overthinking. Gets you unstuck fast.\n5. **“Rewrite this text/email — keep meaning, improve clarity & tone, make it sound more confident / casual / (choose tone).”** *Why it works:* Cuts editing time. Mistakes + tone misfires cost more in stress/time.\n6. **“Give me ideas to beat procrastination / eliminate distractions for \\[task\\]. Suggest small tweaks I can apply right now.”** *Why it works:* Procrastination kills hours. Having specific, actionable tactics breaks the inertia.\n7. **“Create a checklist / timeline for launching \\[project / idea / task\\] in X days.”** *Why it works:* It maps everything out so you don’t forget steps, waste time using wrong tools, or double-do things.\n8. **“Summarize this article / report / video in 5 bullet points: key facts + what I should care about.”** *Why it works:* You get the gist fast. Saves reading / watching + skipping fluff.\n9. **“Act as a content repurposer. Turn this \\[blog post / blog idea / newsletter\\] into: a tweet thread, Instagram caption + LinkedIn post.”** *Why it works:* Makes your content stretch farther. Less new creation, more leverage.\n10. **“Review my day: what went well, what felt wasteful, and what adjustments should I make for tomorrow.”** *Why it works:* Helps build real feedback loops. You learn what slows you down or stresses you, then change it.\n\n**Tips to get more from prompts:**\n\n* Be specific: the more context you feed in (what you tried, what’s going wrong), the less back-and-forth.\n* Use follow-ups: start with a basic prompt, then refine (“Now adapt this for \\_\\_\\_”, “make it shorter”, etc.).\n* Save your best prompts: have a doc or prompt bank so you don’t re-type or forget the ones that work.\n* Mix them: combine some of the prompts above (e.g. summary + repurposer + checklist) to build momentum.",

Your constraints. Your actual leverage points. The real trade-offs you're facing.\n\nSo I decided to fix it.\n\nI opened a new chat and typed this prompt 👇:\n\n\\---------\n\nYou are a senior strategy advisor with expertise in decision analysis, opportunity cost assessment, and high-stakes planning. Your job is to help me think strategically, not give me generic advice.\n\nMy situation: \\[Describe your situation, goal, constraints, resources, and what you've already tried\\]\n\nYour task:\n\nAsk 3-5 clarifying questions to understand my context deeply before giving any advice\n\nIdentify the 2-3 highest-leverage actions specific to MY situation (not generic best practices)\n\nFor each action, explain: • Why it matters MORE than the other 20 things I could do • What I'm likely underestimating (time, cost, risk, or complexity) • The real trade-offs and second-order effects\n\nChallenge any faulty assumptions I'm making\n\nRank recommendations by Impact × Feasibility and explain your reasoning\n\nOutput as:\n\nStrategic Analysis: \\[What's really going on in my situation\\]\n\nTop 3 Moves: \\[Ranked with rationale\\]\n\nWhat I'm Missing: \\[Blind spots or risks I haven't considered\\]\n\nFirst Next Step: \\[Specific, actionable\\]\n\nBe direct. Be specific. Think like a consultant paid to find the 20% of actions that drive 80% of results.\n\n\\---------\n\nFor better results:\n\nIf you want more  prompts like this, check out: [More Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)",

      "text": "TLDR\n\n* You do not need to memorize Excel formulas. You need a repeatable way to tell ChatGPT what your sheet looks like and what results you want.\n* The trick is not asking for a formula. The trick is giving structure: headers, a tiny sample, and the exact output format you want.\n* Below is a plug-and-play prompt system for: formulas, pivots, charts, cleaning messy data, debugging errors, and automation.\n* Always verify: test on 10 rows, sanity-check totals, and have ChatGPT explain edge cases before you trust it.\n\nYou don’t need to master Excel.  \nYou need to master giving ChatGPT great directions for Excel.\n\nMost people use ChatGPT like this:  \nMake a formula for X\n\nThat usually returns:  \nA formula that almost works  \nWith one silent mistake  \nThat you only discover after you emailed the spreadsheet to your boss\n\nHere is the upgrade: treat ChatGPT like an Excel analyst you hired. Analysts cannot read minds. They need inputs and good direction.\n\nThe one rule that makes ChatGPT good at Excel  \nChatGPT is only as smart as your sheet description and direction.\n\nEvery great Excel prompt includes:\n\n* Your Excel version: Microsoft 365, 2021, Google Sheets, etc\n* Your table layout: headers + what each column means\n* A small sample: 5 to 10 rows is enough\n* The exact output you want: formula, pivot steps, chart type, macro plan, etc\n* Where it should go: which cell, which sheet, which range\n\nThe Master Prompt Blueprint  \nCopy/paste this and fill in the brackets:\n\nAct as an Excel power user and QA tester.  \nExcel version: \\[Microsoft 365 / Excel 2021 / Sheets\\].  \nLocale: \\[US uses commas, EU uses semicolons\\].  \nGoal: \\[what you want to calculate or build\\].\n\nMy data table:\n\n* Sheet name: \\[Sheet1\\]\n* Headers: \\[Header1, Header2, Header3...\\]\n* Definitions: \\[Header1 means..., Header2 means...\\]\n* Sample rows (include blanks and weird cases if they exist): \\[paste 5 to 10 rows\\]\n\nOutput requirements:\n\n1. Give the best formula or step-by-step build.\n2. Tell me exactly where to put it.\n3. Explain how it works in plain English.\n4. List edge cases that could break it.\n5. Give a quick way to validate it with a spot-check.\n\nNow here is the prompt library that prints results\n\n**Formula Creation prompts**\n\nA. Build the formula from scratch I have headers \\[A, B, C\\]. I need \\[result\\] in column \\[D\\]. Give me the best formula for Microsoft 365 using modern functions if helpful. Also give a compatibility version for older Excel.\n\nB. Replace a messy formula with a cleaner one  \nHere is my current formula: \\[paste\\]. It works sometimes. Rewrite it to be simpler, faster, and easier to audit. Explain what you changed.\n\nC. Convert a manual process into a formula  \nRight now I do this by hand: \\[steps\\]. Turn it into a formula that I can drag down.  \n  \nD. Weighted average without headaches Headers: Date, Rep, Revenue, Weight. I need weighted average revenue by Rep. Give a formula and also a pivot option.\n\nE. Lookups that do not break  \nI need to match \\[ID\\] from Table1 to Table2 and return \\[field\\]. Sometimes IDs are missing or duplicated. Give the safest approach and how to detect duplicates.\n\n**Troubleshooting prompts**\n\nA. Diagnose an error like a mechanic My formula returns \\[error type\\]. Formula: \\[paste\\]. Data types: \\[numbers, text, dates\\]. Tell me the top 3 likely causes and the fastest fix.\n\nB. Fix a spill problem  \nI used a dynamic array formula and it spills into filled cells. Tell me how to restructure the sheet so the formula can spill safely.\n\nC. My totals are wrong but no errors  \nI expected \\[expected\\]. I got \\[actual\\]. Give me a checklist to find the mistake, including hidden rows, filters, text numbers, and double counting.\n\n**Data Cleaning prompts**\n\nA. Standardize messy columns Column \\[X\\] has inconsistent values like \\[examples\\]. Give me the fastest way to standardize them: formula option and Power Query option.\n\nB. Split one column into many  \nI have a column with values like \\[example\\]. I need \\[piece1\\] in one column and \\[piece2\\] in another. Give me steps and a formula.\n\nC. Remove duplicates with rules  \nDefine duplicate as: \\[same email\\], but keep the newest by \\[date\\]. Tell me exactly how to do this.\n\nD. Fix dates that are text  \nMy dates look like dates but sort wrong. Tell me how to detect which are text and convert them safely.\n\n**Data Analysis prompts**\n\nA. Build a pivot table that answers the business question My question: \\[question\\]. Headers: \\[list\\]. Tell me the best pivot table configuration: rows, columns, values, filters, and any calculated fields.\n\nB. Trend and anomaly scan  \nAnalyze this dataset for trends, seasonality, and anomalies. Tell me what to chart, what to compute, and what might be driving the weird spikes.\n\nC. Cohort style analysis without fancy tools  \nI want to group users by first month and track revenue over time. Tell me the simplest Excel approach and the pivot setup.\n\nD. Forecasting that is honest  \nGiven this historical series, propose 2 forecast methods: simple and better. Tell me assumptions and how to validate accuracy.\n\n**Visualization prompts**\n\nA. Pick the right chart type I need to communicate \\[message\\] to \\[audience\\]. Data shape: \\[time series / categories / distributions\\]. Suggest the best chart and why, plus the exact build steps.\n\nB. Make the chart readable  \nHere is my chart problem: \\[too cluttered / labels overlap / tiny axis\\]. Tell me how to redesign it for clarity and executive readability.\n\nC. Build a one-page dashboard  \nMy KPI list: \\[KPIs\\]. My audience: \\[CFO / sales leader\\]. Build a layout plan: what goes top, what filters to add, what charts to include, and what to avoid.\n\n**Automation and Macros prompts**\n\nA. Automate a repetitive workflow Every week I do: \\[steps\\]. Propose the best automation path: formulas, Power Query, pivot refresh, or macro. Tell me which is safest and why.\n\nB. Macro spec generator  \nI want a macro that does: \\[steps\\]. Before writing code, ask me the missing questions, then produce a clean implementation plan and a test checklist.\n\nC. Red flag highlighting rules  \nI need to highlight rows where \\[conditions\\]. Give me conditional formatting rules first. If that is not enough, propose an automation plan.\n\n**Productivity prompts**\n\nA. Make my workbook idiot-proof My workbook is used by non-technical people. Give me best practices: input cells, data validation, protected ranges, and an instructions tab template.\n\nB. Speed shortcuts that matter  \nI do a lot of filtering, selecting ranges, and cleaning. Give me the top shortcuts and when to use each.\n\nC. Turn this into a template  \nHere is the workflow: \\[description\\]. Tell me how to structure tabs and naming so it is reusable and auditable.\n\n**Best Practices prompts**\n\nA. Workbook architecture I have tabs for raw, cleaned, analysis, dashboard. Propose the best structure and naming rules, plus how to prevent accidental edits.\n\nB. Audit and QA  \nGive me a QA checklist for this sheet: formula consistency, totals, outliers, duplicates, and reconciliation checks.\n\nC. Performance tune-up  \nMy file is slow. Based on these features \\[volatile formulas, whole-column refs, many pivots\\], tell me the likely bottlenecks and fixes.\n\n**The 10-minute Excel workflow that actually works**\n\n1. Paste headers + 10 rows\n2. Ask ChatGPT for the build and the test plan\n3. Implement on a small range first\n4. Validate with spot checks\n5. Scale to the full dataset\n\n**What to avoid**\n\n* Dumping your entire spreadsheet and hoping for magic\n* Asking for one perfect formula without specifying edge cases\n* Trusting the first answer without validation\n* Sharing sensitive data. Mask names, emails, revenue if needed\n\n**Why this works**\n\nExcel problems are rarely formula problems. They are context problems: messy data, unclear definitions, edge cases. The prompt blueprint forces clarity, which is what ChatGPT needs to be useful.\n\n",

      "text": "You can use ChatGPT to create the same high quality photos as if you used a $10,000 DSLR camera with this simple prompting framework.  \n  \n**TL;DR:** Most AI images look fake because they default to a wide-angle, flat perspective. By forcing ChatGPT to use telephoto focal lengths in prompts (85mm, 200mm, 300mm), you trigger lens compression, which pulls the background closer, isolates the subject, and creates authentic-looking bokeh. This is the single biggest unlock for photorealism I’ve found.\n\nI see so many people using words like *photorealistic*, *4k*, and *ultra-detailed in image prompts* and getting the same plastic, AI-looking results. The problem isn't your adjectives; it's your virtual camera.\n\nReal photographers don't just point and shoot; they choose a lens to tell a story. I’ve been testing **ChatGPT's new image model** extensively, and it turns out it actually understands the physics of optical compression.\n\nHere is the breakdown of why this works, examples from my recent tests, and a template you can use.\n\n**Telephoto lenses do three things that scream real photo:**\n\n1. Compression Distant backgrounds appear closer and larger. This creates that premium stacked look in sports, wildlife, cinema, city scenes, and car ads.\n2. Subject isolation Wide apertures + long focal lengths create strong background blur and foreground blur. The subject pops without needing fake HDR.\n3. Flattering geometry Portrait focal lengths reduce the exaggerated wide-angle look on faces.\n\n**The Physics of AI**\n\nWhen you don't specify a lens, ChatGPT defaults to a generic \\~35mm wide angle. This creates two problems:\n\n1. **facial distortion:** It slightly bulges the nose and widens the face (the \"selfie effect\").\n2. **Background separation:** The background feels too far away and sharp, making the subject look like a sticker pasted onto a scene.\n\n**Telephoto lenses (85mm+) do the opposite.** They flatten features (making faces more attractive) and, crucially, they **compress the background**. They make distant objects appear huge and close behind your subject, which is a hallmark of high-end cinema and professional photography.\n\n10 Examples\n\nHere are ten specific use cases where this tech absolutely shines.\n\nExample 1: The Paparazzi Street Portrait\n\n**The Concept:** You want a subject in a busy city, but you don't want the chaos to distract. A long lens blurs the crowd into a beautiful abstract wash of color. **The Tech:** Using a **200mm lens** here forces the AI to render the background pedestrians as large, soft blobs of color rather than distinct, distracting figures.\n\n**Prompt:** *Candid street photo of a blonde haired woman in a beige trench coat on the sidewalk as she is walking towards the camera in New York City, golden hour lighting, shot on a 200mm telephoto lens, f/2.8 aperture, extreme background compression, background is a wash of bokeh city lights, sharp focus on eyes, motion blur on pedestrians, authentic film grain.*\n\nExample 2: The Automotive Stacker\n\n**The Concept:** Car commercials never shoot wide-angle unless they are inside the car. Exterior shots use long lenses to make the car look powerful and the city behind it look massive. **The Tech:** A **300mm focal length** \"stacks\" the background layers. It makes the distant city skyline look like it's looming right behind the car, adding drama and scale that a wide angle just can't achieve.\n\n**Prompt:** *majestic shot of a vintage red Porsche 911 driving on a wet highway, rainy overcast day, shot on 300mm super-telephoto lens, background is a compressed wall of skyscrapers looming close, cinematic color grading, high contrast, water spray from tires, hyper-realistic depth of field.*\n\nExample 3: The Lioness Shot\n\n**The Concept:** Getting an intimate, dangerous portrait of a predator without disturbing the subject (or getting eaten). This style mimics high-end nature documentaries. **The Tech:** A **400mm super-telephoto lens** completely obliterates the foreground and background distractions. It creates a \"tunnel vision\" effect that focuses 100% of the viewer's attention on the predator's eyes.\n\n**Prompt:** *A lioness crouching in tall dry grass, staring directly into the lens, heat haze shimmering, shot on 400mm super-telephoto lens, extreme shallow depth of field, blurred foreground grass, National Geographic style, sharp focus on eyes.*\n\nExample 4: The Gridiron Freeze\n\n**The Concept:** Sports photography is all about isolating the athlete from the chaotic environment of the stadium. You want to see the muscle tension, not the fan in row 30 eating a hotdog. **The Tech:** Using a **600mm sports lens** allows you to freeze fast motion from the sidelines while turning the stadium crowd into a beautiful, colorful wall of noise.\n\n**Prompt:** *Action shot of an NFL wide receiver leaping high in the end zone to catch a football, mid-air suspension, defender's hand reaching, shot on 600mm sports telephoto lens, f/2.8, stadium crowd is a colorful bokeh blur, stadium lights flaring, hyper-detailed jersey texture, sweat flying, frozen motion.*\n\nExample 5: The Ringside Knockout\n\n**The Concept:** Capturing the visceral impact of combat sports. You want to feel the sweat flying and the force of the punch. **The Tech:** A **200mm lens** creates a \"compressed\" look where the fighters seem larger than life against the blurry ropes and lights. It emphasizes the physical connection of the punch.\n\n**Prompt:** *Visceral shot of two heavyweight boxers in the ring, one landing a knockout punch, sweat flying in slow motion, facial distortion from impact, shot on 200mm telephoto lens, smoky arena atmosphere, ropes blurred in foreground, cinematic lighting, aggressive composition*\n\nExample 6: The High Fashion Runway\n\n**The Concept:** You want that elite Vogue look where the model dominates the frame and the audience is just a dark, admiring texture in the back. **The Tech:** A **200mm f/2.8 lens** is standard for runway photographers. It isolates the model from the chaotic background of editors and influencers, creating a pop effect where the dress texture is hyper-sharp against the dark void.\n\n**Prompt:** *Full body shot of a beautiful blonde fashion model walking the runway in an haute couture designer dress, elite fashion show atmosphere, shot on 200mm telephoto lens, f/2.8, audience in background is a dark motion-blurred texture, spotlights creating rim light on hair, high fashion photography, sharp focus on fabric texture, confident expression.*\n\nExample 7: The Red Carpet Premiere\n\n**The Concept:** The classic Hollywood glamour shot. You need the sparkle of the flashbulbs without seeing the individual photographers. **The Tech:** An **85mm or 105mm portrait lens** is perfect here. It flatters facial features (no big noses) and turns the wall of paparazzi cameras behind the stars into a glittering bokeh field of light orbs.\n\n**Prompt:** *Glamorous shot of movie stars posing on the red carpet of a Hollywood movie premiere, paparazzi flashbulbs going off, shot on 85mm portrait lens, f/1.4, creamy bokeh of photographers and lights in background, tuxedo and evening gown, skin texture, sparkling jewelry, confident smiles, vanity fair style.*\n\nExample 8: The World Cup Volley\n\n**The Concept:** The definitive sports moment. The goal here is to make the player look heroic and the stadium look infinite. **The Tech:** A **400mm lens** compresses the distance between the player and the stands, making the wall of fans look like a massive, vertical tapestry of color right behind the action.\n\n**Prompt:** *Cinematic shot of a soccer star mid-volley kicking the winning goal in a world cup match, grass flying, shot on 400mm sports lens, stadium lights flaring, background is a compressed wall of cheering fans, intense facial expression, frozen motion, ball deformation from impact, 8k resolution, dramatic lighting.*\n\nExample 9: The Monaco Hairpin (F1)\n\n**The Concept:** Speed and luxury. You want to show the car is in a specific location (Monaco) without the background buildings taking focus away from the engineering. **The Tech:** A **500mm lens** creates \"stacking\" where the yachts and apartments of Monaco appear to loom directly over the track, emphasizing the tight, claustrophobic nature of the street circuit.\n\n**Prompt:** *F1 race car taking a tight corner at the Monaco Grand Prix, low angle, shot on 500mm telephoto lens, background is a compressed blur of luxury yachts and apartments, heat haze from engine, motion blur on wheels, daylight, hyper-realistic asphalt texture, vibrant livery.*\n\nExample 10: The River King\n\n**The Concept:** The ultimate nature action shot. It’s about freezing water droplets and fur texture while keeping the environment soft and dreamy. **The Tech:** A **600mm super-telephoto lens** allows you to get \"in the water\" with the bear. It turns the rushing river water in the foreground and the forest in the background into smooth, painted textures.\n\n**Prompt:** majestic shot of a brown bear standing in a rushing river catching a salmon mid-air, water splashing, shot on 600mm super-telephoto lens, f/4, forest background compressed and soft, nature documentary style, wet fur texture, dramatic lighting, sharp focus on bear's eyes and fish.\n\n**The Telephoto Prompt Template**\n\nUse this structure. Keep the camera physics words in place.\n\n**Template**\n\n* Subject + action\n* Location\n* Light\n* Lens + aperture\n* Distance cues\n* Compression + bokeh cues\n* Freeze or pan cues\n* Atmosphere cues (haze, spray, heat shimmer)\n* Optional camera body / film\n\n**Copy/paste skeleton**  \n\\[Subject doing action\\] in \\[location\\], \\[time of day and light\\], shot on a \\[85mm/135mm/200mm/400mm/600mm/800mm\\] telephoto lens, \\[f/1.4 to f/5.6\\], from far away, strong background compression, shallow depth of field, creamy bokeh, tack-sharp eyes or helmet, natural color, realistic texture, subtle atmospheric haze, documentary sports or editorial style.\n\nCopy this structure. The items in brackets are where you put your specific creative ideas, but keep the technical keywords (in bold) to force the lens effect.\n\n**Key Focal Lengths to try:**\n\n* 85mm: portraits, red carpet, lifestyle, head and shoulders\n* 135mm: fashion, editorial, premium subject separation\n* 200mm: paparazzi, street spy, concert photography, runway isolation\n* 300mm: automotive stack, city compression, cinematic background scale\n* 400mm to 600mm: sports and wildlife, wall of background color, action freeze\n* 800mm: extreme scale shots (big waves, distant wildlife, mountain faces)\n\n**Pro Tips**\n\n* **Aperture matters:** If you specify a focal length like 200mm, also specify a wide aperture (low f-number like f/2.8 or f/1.4). This tells the AI *why* you are using that lens (to blur the background).\n* **Distance keywords:** Use words like *far away*, *distant shot*, or *from a distance* in combination with the zoom lens. It helps the AI understand the spatial relationship.\n* **Don't mix conflicting terms:** Don't ask for *wide angle* and *bokeh* in the same prompt. Physics doesn't work that way, and neither does the model.\n\nLet me know if you guys try this out. The difference in realism is awesome!",

When their plan breaks, they quit.\n\nIf you want 2026 to be different, stop trying to be \"resilient\" (resisting shocks) and start becoming **Antifragile**.\n\n**The Logic of Antifragility:** In his work, Nassim Taleb defines Antifragility as things that actually *benefit* from disorder. While the 1% rule is about steady growth, Antifragility is about **Optionality** and **Barbell Strategies**:\n\n* **The Barbell:** You play it extremely safe in 90% of your life to eliminate \"ruin,\" while taking small, aggressive risks in the other 10%.\n* **The Result:** You don't just survive chaos; you use it as fuel to leapfrog everyone who is playing it safe.\n\n**Try this prompt 👇:**\n\n    I want you to act as an Antifragility Systems Engineer. Your goal is to help me design a life operating system for 2026 based on Nassim Taleb’s principles. We are moving away from \"fragile\" linear goals and toward a system that gains strength from stress and volatility.\n    \n    Mandatory Instructions:\n    \n    Identify the Fragility: Ask me for ONE area of my life (Career, Health, or Finance) where I feel stuck or vulnerable to setbacks.\n    \n    The Barbell Strategy: Once I provide the area, design a \"Barbell\" approach. Give me a \"Floor\" (the 90% hyper-conservative habit to prevent failure) and a \"Cap\" (the 10% aggressive, high-upside experiment).\n    Eliminate the Negative: Instead of telling me what to add, use \"Via Negativa.\" \n    \n    Identify 3 specific \"fragilizers\" (habits or dependencies) I must subtract to stop leaking progress.\n    \n    Stress Testing: Create a \"Volatility Protocol.\" Tell me exactly what I should do when things go wrong (a missed workout, a market dip, a rejected proposal) so that the setback actually triggers a gain in the system.\n    \n    The Optionality Matrix: List 3 \"low-stakes bets\" I can place in this area that have limited downside but infinite upside.\n    \n    2026 Post Traumatic Growth Projection: Describe what my life looks like on December 31st, 2026, after a year of using chaos as an advantage rather than an obstacle.\n    \n    Do not give me a motivational speech. Use cynical, risk management logic. Ask me for my ONE vulnerable area to begin\n\n**For more prompts like this , Feel free to check out :** [Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)",

Permissiveness is a fragilizer.\n\nHere’s a clear-eyed assessment, then a surgical upgrade, then I’ll start.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat Works (Why this isn’t fluff)\n\t•\tAntifragility lens forces systems thinking instead of goal worship.\n\t•\tVia Negativa is the right bias. Most lives fail by subtraction neglected, not addition absent.\n\t•\tBarbell framing prevents the classic trap of medium-risk mediocrity.\n\t•\tVolatility protocol is the strongest part. Most people collapse here.\n\t•\tOptionality aligns with asymmetric upside rather than prediction.\n\nIn short: this prompt pushes against comfort-seeking optimization. Good.\n\n⸻\n\nWhere It’s Still Fragile\n\t1.\tToo abstract by default\nWithout forcing concrete behaviors, this could drift into elegant prose with zero mechanical leverage.\n\t2.\tNo constraint on time, money, or energy\nAntifragile systems require bounded downside. You haven’t enforced the bounds.\n\t3.\tNo explicit kill-switches\nExperiments without predefined failure conditions quietly rot.\n\n⸻\n\nMinimal Upgrades (Do not overengineer)\n\nIf you want this to actually work in practice, add three constraints:\n\t1.\tQuantification rule\n\t•\tFloors must be daily or weekly behaviors.\n\t•\tCaps must have a max cost (time, money, reputation).\n\t2.\tKill criteria for the Cap\n\t•\tEach aggressive bet must include:\n“If X hasn’t happened by Y date, I shut this down without debate.”\n\t3.\tAnti-hero framing\n\t•\tBan language about “purpose,” “alignment,” or “passion.”\nSystems outperform narratives.\n\nThat’s it. Don’t add more.\n\n⸻\n\nVerdict\n\t•\tIs it useful? Yes.\n\t•\tIs it dangerous? Only if you treat it like a manifesto instead of a control system.\n\t•\tWill it expose uncomfortable truths? Absolutely. That’s the point.\n\n⸻\n\nBegin\n\nPer your own rules, we do one variable at a time.\n\nChoose ONE vulnerable area to stress-test first:\n\t•\tCareer\n\t•\tHealth\n\t•\tFinance\n\nReply with one word only.",

      "text": "A **Misogi** is a Japanese Shinto tradition of ritual purification that has evolved into a modern \"hero’s journey.\" It is a challenge so daunting that you have a 50% chance of failure. It isn't just a goal; it’s a quest designed to \"wash away\" the person you think you are and reveal the person you actually are.\n\nThe problem? Most of us pick challenges for the year that are \"impressive\" to others rather than transformative for ourselves. We choose based on vanity, not the specific \"impurities\" (fears/weaknesses) we actually need to burn off.\n\nTry this prompt 👇:\n\n\\-------\n\n\"I want you to act as a stoic guide helping me identify my **Misogi for 2026** a singular, daunting challenge that will force a fundamental internal shift. We must bypass my ego’s desire for 'bragging rights' and find the specific threshold that scares me for the right reasons.\n\n**Mandatory Instructions:**\n\n* **Do Not** ask me about my fitness level, my bucket list, or what I think I 'should' do.\n* **Do Not** offer encouragement or 'coaching' fluff.\n* **All Questions** must be sensory, visceral, and centered on discomfort, resistance, and the concept of 'the void.'\n* **Provide a continuous sequence of 10-12 questions only.** Do not pause for my answers yet.\n* Each question must be a short, rapid-fire choice between two extremes or a sensory prompt.\n\n**The Analysis (Post-Response):** Only after I answer, perform a cold, structured breakdown of my Misogi:\n\n1. **The Shadow Barrier:** The specific fear I am currently disguising as 'logic' or 'practicality.'\n2. **The Purification Point:** What specific part of my ego needs to 'die' for me to grow.\n3. **The Misogi Blueprint:** A specific, high-stakes physical or mental undertaking tailored to my psychological resistance.\n4. **The Failure Margin:** Why I am likely to fail this challenge, and why that failure is necessary.\n5. **The 2026 Resurgence:** A direct, unsoftened profile of the person who emerges from the other side of this fire.\n\nDo not ask for my permission or agreement. Begin the sequence of questions immediately.\"\n\n  \n\\-----------\n\nIf you want more transformative prompts like this, check out :[ Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)",

          "text": "It’s still only going to respond within the bounds of what it currently knows about you. A Misogi is not a journey one seeks out after much evaluation. Like a hero’s journey, it is a journey one becomes compelled to embark on based on external factors, that simply happen to also be transformative to the individual. This is mainly because the journey is one that brings the most growth the individual has ever had to experience.\n\nChatGPT will just say the things it thinks you want it to say. It will only pretend to be stoic, but not actually be stoic on any meaningful level. Furthermore, the tone it uses has everything to do with ego. Asking it to be tough with you and not give you fluff is no different than someone asking for extra fluff. I sometimes ask it to talk to me like it’s a disrespectful teenager, because I think the responses are hilarious.\n\nChatGPT can be the most helpful assistant you’ve ever had in your life in ways. But it doesn’t have nearly enough depth and cognitive complexity to help lead your life in any way. For example, using it as your therapist is a terrible idea. But using it to help you organize your thoughts and questions and prepare for your appointment with a therapist is a way it can add tremendous value.\n\nThe point is, you should always be pointing the way in your life. ChatGPT should be an assistant along the way, helping in an almost infinite number of ways. But you shouldn’t ask it to lead you in your life.",

          "text": "The Analysis\n\n1. The Shadow Barrier\nYou are disguising control addiction as prudence.\nWhat you call “being realistic,” “waiting until healthier,” or “not yet” is, at root, a refusal to enter any situation where outcomes cannot be managed, framed, or recovered from quietly. Public failure terrifies you not because of judgment, but because it removes your ability to edit the narrative. Your fear is not pain, effort, or suffering—you already accept those. Your fear is irreversibility without authorship.\n\n⸻\n\n2. The Purification Point\nThe part of your ego that must die is the internal systems engineer—the version of you that believes survival depends on foresight, preparation, optimization, and contingency. This ego stays busy so it never has to surrender. It equates control with safety and collapse with annihilation. That belief is false, and it is the bottleneck.\n\n⸻\n\n3. The Misogi Blueprint\nA single, non-negotiable, time-bound physical ordeal in an indifferent natural environment, undertaken alone, where:\n   •   Progress cannot be paused.\n   •   Exit requires public acknowledgment of failure.\n   •   The body—not the plan—decides when you stop.\n   •   External validation is impossible.\n\nExample structure (not symbolic, literal):\n   •   A long-duration, continuous exposure event (cold, altitude, distance, or time)\n   •   No spectators, no audience, no documentation\n   •   One rule: you either complete it or you must formally withdraw in front of others whose respect you value\n\nThe challenge must be chosen so that collapse is plausible, not dramatic. Not heroic—quiet, grinding, indifferent. The environment should not care if you succeed.\n\n⸻\n\n4. The Failure Margin\nYou are likely to fail because you will attempt to out-think the suffering. You will try to regulate, manage, ration, and strategize your way through something that does not respond to intelligence—only endurance and surrender.\nFailure is necessary because your nervous system needs proof that:\n   •   Loss of control does not equal loss of self\n   •   Being seen failing does not end you\n   •   Collapse is not moral failure\n\nIf you succeed too cleanly, the Misogi has failed.\n\n⸻\n\n5. The 2026 Resurgence\nThe person who emerges is quieter, less explanatory, and less interested in control.\nThey move slower but commit faster.\nThey do not negotiate with discomfort or narrate suffering.\nThey no longer confuse preparedness with worth.\nThey trust exposure over strategy and direct contact over abstraction.\n\nThis version of you is not tougher.\nThey are less defended.\n\nThat is the shift you are being called toward.",

      "text": "Most people prompting for \"photorealistic\" or \"4k\" still end up with a flat, uncanny AI look. The problem isn’t your adjectives; it’s your **virtual camera.**\n\nBy default, image generators often default to a generic wide angle lens. This is why AI faces can look slightly distorted and backgrounds often feel like a flat sticker pasted behind the subject.\n\n**The Fix: Telephoto Lens Compression**\n\nIf you force the AI to use long focal lengths (85mm to 600mm), you trigger **optical compression.** \n\nThis \"stacks\" the layers of the image, pulling the background closer to the subject. \n\nIt flattens facial features to make them more natural and creates authentic bokeh that doesn't look like a digital filter.\n\n**The Focal Length Cheat Sheet**\n\n|**Focal Length**|**Best Use Case**|**Visual Effect**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**85mm**|Portraits|The \"Portrait King.\" Flattering headshots and glamour.|\n|**200mm**|Street/Action|The \"Paparazzi Lens.\" Isolates subjects in busy crowds.|\n|**400mm–600mm**|Sports/Wildlife|Turns a crowd into a wash of color; makes distant backgrounds look massive.|\n\n\n\n**Example: The \"Automotive Stacker\"**\n\nTo make a car look high-end, avoid generic prompts like \"car on a road.\" \n\nInstead, use specific camera physics:\n\n***Prompt:*** *Majestic shot of a vintage red Porsche 911 on a wet highway, rainy overcast day,* ***shot on 300mm super telephoto lens****, background is a compressed wall of skyscrapers looming close, cinematic color grading, water spray from tires, hyper-realistic depth of field.*\n\n  \n**The \"Pro-Photo\" Prompt Template** :\n\nUse this structure to eliminate the \"AI plastic\" look:\n\n**\\[Subject + Action\\]** in **\\[Location\\]**, **\\[Lighting\\]**, shot on **\\[85mm-600mm\\]** lens, **\\[f/1.8 - f/4 aperture\\]**, extreme background compression, shallow depth of field, tack-sharp focus on eyes, **\\[atmospheric detail like haze or dust\\]**.\n\n  \nThese AI models actually understand the physics of light and blur you just have to tell the prompt exactly which lens to \"mount\" on the virtual camera.\n\nWant more of these? I’ve been documenting these \"camera physics\" hacks and more.\n\nFeel free to check out this library of 974+ prompts online for free to explore.

Early movies looked like filmed stage plays. Early phones sounded like telegrams. And today? **AI looks like chat boxes.**\n\nWe're in what Zhao calls the **\"waterwheel phase\"** — we're using revolutionary technology but applying it with outdated mental models.\n\nWhat This Actually Means\n\nTake programmers right now. One person can manage multiple AI agents — not by typing faster, but by working at a **completely different scale**. Think bicycle to car level of transformation.\n\nBut here's the problem: **Our companies weren't designed for infinite minds.** They were designed for meetings, handoffs, and hierarchy. They literally break as they grow.\n\nAI as \"Steel\" for Organizations\n\nZhao argues AI becomes the structural material for organizations — providing context without noise and decisions without friction.\n\nRight now we're just bolting AI onto old workflows. Like strapping a rocket to a horse carriage.\n\nThe real transformation happens when we **redesign everything** around infinite minds. When we stop asking \"how can AI help me do my job?\" and start asking \"what becomes possible when intelligence is no longer the constraint?\"\n\nMy Take\n\nWe're still figuring out what the \"car\" looks like. Most companies are in denial about how fundamentally things need to change. The orgs that figure this out first will have an absurd advantage.\n\nWhat do you think? Are we really ready to redesign everything, or will we just keep bolting AI onto broken systems?",

For corporate America, the question becomes: what's the thing that's too expensive—either monetarily or in risk—to hand to the AI? Whatever that is, there will be a massive reorganization around it.\n2. **It won't change as much as you think, but the level of detail will.** If you look at pre-computer companies vs. companies today, they roughly operate the same. Sure, the ledger went from paper to Excel, but someone is still keeping a GL. What *changed* is what has to be tracked in that GL. In a world of \"infinite minds,\" the level of detail is going to be insane—but someone still has to keep the GL.\n3. **Software is dead.** We might even hit the Stallman dream. If AI is writing all the software for $200/month, why not share the code? If it makes my AI build faster to sneak snippets of your AI's output, why wouldn't we?\n4. **Value destruction.** Similar to #3 and #1, and not to be too much of a doomer, but I don't think we've really considered how much value destruction is in our future. So much of the stock market and labor is based on perceived value that's being replaced by token costs. If I was paying you $200K/year, and an AI can do it for $0.0001 in tokens—generating 100 outputs in 10 seconds—not only is that product worth less, but all the businesses that relied on it get \"cheaper\" too. And with even small models getting better and better...\n5. **The Star Trek computer.** I've been thinking a lot about how the characters used it—its role in their society. That's much closer to what the model is going to look like: ephemeral applications, voice commands, ubiquitous but centered on the person.\n6. **Content will be king.** People hate slop, whether it's created by committee or by AI. Personalized voice and taste will be the new gold. Sadly, all those economies are horribly winner-take-all.",

Help me build a schedule that’s realistic.”\n\n**Turning notes into to-dos**\n\n    After meetings or voice notes, I just paste the mess in and say: “Clean this up into a task list, prioritize it, and suggest deadlines.”\n\n**Writing awkward messages**\n\n    “Send a friendly but firm message saying I can’t make it to [event]. Keep it short and polite.”\n\n**Quick meal ideas**\n\n    I’ll say: “What can I make this week with eggs, rice, lentils, and spinach?” → it gives me a week’s worth of meals in 10 seconds.\n\n**No more last-minute gifts**\n\n    “Gift ideas for a friend who’s into design, hiking, and coffee. Budget under $60.”\n\n**Actually understanding adult stuff**\n\n    “Explain how taxes work like I’m 12” → better than Googling 12 blog posts.\n\nI’ve saved about 100 of these prompts into a personal collection that covers everyday life, planning, writing, learning, decision-making — all grouped by use case.

I was down to $0 this week and decided to see if I could actually build a functional system using only free tools and my laptop.\n\nI didn't want to make a generic \"How to use AI\" book. Instead, I solved a specific problem: The \"Blank Page\" problem for TikTok creators.\n\nThe Problem: Most people want to start faceless TikTok accounts (History, Stoicism, Facts), but they spend 4 hours researching and writing scripts that don't even go viral.\n\nThe Step-by-Step AI Solution:\n\n1. The \"Reverse Engineering\" Prompt I didn't just ask ChatGPT to \"write a script.\" I fed it transcripts of the top 10 viral videos in the \"Dark Psychology\" niche. I used this prompt:\n\n\"Analyze the hook, the pacing, and the retention triggers of these 10 scripts. Create a 'Master Prompt' that I can use to generate 50 unique variations of this exact style while keeping the engagement high.\"\n\n2. The 48-Hour Build\n\n* Hours 1-5: I used the \"Master Prompt\" to generate 100 high-hook scripts.\n* Hours 6-12: I moved to Canva (Free version). I used their \"Bulk Create\" feature (you can upload a CSV or just paste a list). I mapped my scripts to a \"Phone Video\" template.\n* The Result: I had 100 ready-to-post video backgrounds with text overlays in less than a day.\n\n1. The \"Productization\" I realized the prompts I used were more valuable than the videos themselves. I spent the next day organizing these into a \"Faceless Viral Vault.\" I included:\n\n* The \"Master Prompt\" for 2026.\n* 100 pre-written viral hooks.\n* A workflow on how to use Crikk/NoteGPT for the voiceovers.\n\nThe Results (The \"Money\" Part): I put the PDF on Gumroad as \"Pay What You Want\" ($5 minimum).\n\n* Day 1: 8 sales ($40 total).\n* Day 2: 20 sales ($100 total) after I shared the workflow in a few Discord servers.\n\nWhy I’m sharing this: I’m tired of the \"gatekeeping.\" You don't need a $2,000 course. You need a laptop, free wifi, and a specific problem to solve.\n\nI’m not going to drop the link here because I don't want to spam the sub, but if you're stuck in \"broke-mode\" and want the specific prompt list I used to generate the scripts, let me know in the comments and I’ll DM it to you.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about the workflow or the tools!\n\nI have the full prompt list in a PDF if anyone wants it. Just let me know.\"",

Whether we like the content or not, the algorithms reward **Retention**. These 'Dark Psychology' hooks are built on psychological triggers that human brains are literally hardwired to respond to (curiosity, fear, social status).\n\nI don't make the rules of the algorithm; I just build the tools for people who want to leverage them for a side hustle. Most of my buyers use these 'garbage' scripts to build accounts that they eventually flip for thousands or use to drive traffic to legitimate businesses.\n\nIt’s not about the art; it’s about the **arbitrage of attention.**",

The Connection:** Dark Psychology content (like body language hacks or social 'tricks') taps into a primitive survival instinct. People are hardwired to stop scrolling when they feel they're getting 'secret' knowledge. By making it **faceless** with high-contrast text and 'Sigma' style visuals, you create an atmosphere of mystery that keeps the average viewer watching until the very last second. **Retention = Viral Growth.**\n\n**2. The Research:** I don't guess what works. I use the 'Top-Down Audit' method. I go to TikTok/YouTube, filter for 'Most Liked' in the last 30 days under keywords like 'Social Engineering' or 'Stoicism,' and use a tool called NoteGPT to pull the transcripts of the top 10 videos.\n\nI then fed those transcripts into a specific AI 'Analysis Prompt' I built to reverse-engineer the hook structures.\n\nI actually included that exact **'Reverse Engineering' workflow** and the top 50 scripts I found inside the Vault. It saves you about 20 hours of research.\n\nLet me know if that makes sense!",

      "text": "There are prompting techniques borrowed from engineering, philosophy, and creative fields that most people don't know exist. \n\nI started using them a few months ago and my outputs completely changed.\n\nHere are 5 techniques that will change how you prompt:  \n  \n**1.⁠ ⁠Reverse Prompting :**  \n  \nMost people write: \"Write a marketing email for my product launch.\"  \n  \nThe result feels like every other marketing email.  \n  \nReverse prompting flips this:  \n  \nShow the AI a finished example and ask:  \n  \n\"What prompt would generate content exactly like this?\"  \n  \nEngineers do this with software, hardware, even competitor products.  \n  \nWhy it works for prompts: AI models are pattern recognition machines.  \n  \nWhen you show them finished work, they can reverse engineer the hidden structure tone, pacing, depth, formatting, emotional intention.  \n  \nTry it:  \n  \nFind an email, article, or post you love. Paste it in, then ask:  \n  \n\"Analyze this text. What prompt would generate content with this exact style, structure, and tone? Give me the prompt.\"  \n  \nNow you have a template that works every time.  \n  \n**2.⁠ ⁠Inversion (Charlie Munger's \"Anti-Goal\" Method)**  \n  \nMost people ask: \"How do I achieve X?\"  \n  \nInversion asks: \"What would guarantee I fail at X?\"  \n  \nWhere it comes from: This is a core mental model used by Warren Buffett's partner Charlie Munger.  \n  \nHe famously said: \"Tell me where I'm going to die so I never go there.\"  \n  \nInstead of chasing success, avoid failure.  \n  \nWhy it works for prompts: AI is surprisingly good at identifying what breaks, what fails, what goes wrong.  \n  \nMap the disasters, and you've mapped the path forward.  \n  \nTry it: Instead of:  \n  \n\"Help me set goals for 2026\" Use: \"What are 10 ways I could guarantee 2026 becomes my worst year? Be specific about the habits, decisions, and situations that would destroy my progress.\"  \n  \nThen you just invert the list. What you avoid becomes what you pursue.  \n  \n**3.⁠ ⁠Constraint-Based Thinking (Force Precision)**  \n  \nMost people give AI complete freedom. That's why everything sounds the same.  \n  \nWhere it comes from: This comes from creative fields poetry, architecture, game design. Twitter had 140 characters.  \n  \nConstraints don't limit creativity they force it.  \n  \nWhy it works for prompts:  \n  \nConstraints kill fluff.  \n  \nThe AI stops pattern matching generic responses and starts problem solving within boundaries.  \n  \nTry it:  \n  \nInstead of:  \n  \n\"Write a product description\"  \n  \nUse: \"Write a product description in exactly 50 words. Include the word 'friction.' Do not use: innovative, solution, cutting-edge, seamless, or revolutionary.\"  \n  \n**4.⁠ ⁠Socratic Method (Question Chains)**  \n  \nMost people ask one question. Get one answer. Stop. Socratic method keeps digging.  \n  \nWhere it comes from: Named after the Greek philosopher Socrates, who taught by asking successive questions that led students to discover answers themselves.  \n  \nEach question built on the last, revealing deeper truth. Why it works for prompts:  \n  \nEach answer builds context. The AI gets smarter as the conversation progresses.  \n  \nBy question 4, you're miles beyond where a single prompt could take you.  \n  \nTry it: \"What makes someone buy a SaaS product?\" → \"Which factor matters most for small business owners?\" → \"What objection kills the sale most often?\" → \"Write email copy that addresses that specific objection for \\[my product\\].\"  \n  \n**5.⁠ ⁠First Principles Thinking (Break the Pattern)**  \n  \nMost people accept surface-level answers.  \n  \nFirst principles tears everything down to fundamental truths.  \n  \nWhere it comes from: This is how Elon Musk approaches problems.  \n  \nAristotle called it \"reasoning from first principles\" breaking things down to their most basic truths and reasoning up from there, rather than reasoning by analogy.  \n  \nWhy it works for prompts: Forces AI to reason from scratch instead of regurgitating common patterns it's seen a thousand times.  \n  \nTry it: Instead of: \"What's good SEO?\"  \n  \nUse: \"Forget all SEO advice.  \n  \nFrom first principles only:  \n  \nwhat is Google's core business model?  \n  \nWhat must they prioritize to stay profitable?  \n  \nBased only on that, what would make them rank a page higher?\"  \n  \nAt their core, mental models are timeless.  \n  \nThey've worked for decades in business, science, and philosophy.  \n  \nIf you want more thinking tools and prompts examples like this,  \n  \nFeel free to check out : [Thinking Tools ](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)",

With my post last year, I even sourced TWO research papers [(such as this one from the University of Florida)](https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/document/2024-04/4.19.24%20Alejandro%20Lopez%20Lira%20ChatGPT_V3.pdf#:~:text=scores%20and%20examine%20the%20predictive,in%20forecasting%20stock%20market%20returns) that suggested AI is useful for this type of task. And yet everybody has to \"prove\" that AI cannot do this and that it's just hallucinating slop.\n\nSo I decided to prove everybody wrong.\n\n2025 has ended and I can see the rating from before and the percent gain since. I performed some analysis that proves that the fundamentally strong AI stock picks are WAY better than the fundamentally weak ones.\n\nIn fact, the probability of this performance difference occurring by chance is less than 1 in 10 octillion (p < 10⁻²⁸). To put that in perspective, assuming stock returns are normally distributed, you're about **36 sextillion times more likely to be killed by an asteroid** ([according to Tulane University research](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/160209-meteorite-death-india-probability-odds)) than for this result to be a statistical fluke.\n\nIn other words, stocks identified as \"fundamentally strong\" didn't just *appear* to do better. **They did better with a level of statistical certainty that's essentially undeniable.**\n\nHere's how I performed this analysis.\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n- [**A Recap on the Methodology**](/@austin-starks/fb5ff130b0ff#a1a8)\n- [**A More Robust Deeper Dive**](/@austin-starks/fb5ff130b0ff#e94c)\n- [**How I proved it beyond a shadow of a doubt?**](/@austin-starks/fb5ff130b0ff#f6fc)\n- [**What does this mean for 2026?**](/@austin-starks/fb5ff130b0ff#3d02)\n- [**Want to copy this strategy?**](/@austin-starks/fb5ff130b0ff#2d98)\n- [**Conclusion**](/@austin-starks/fb5ff130b0ff#c42f)\n- [**TL;DR**](/@austin-starks/fb5ff130b0ff#688d)\n\n# A Recap on the Methodology\n\nThe most validating part about this methodology is that it's lookahead-bias free. The reason being, the reports were generated by the following methodology.\n\n**Analyzing every single stock in the market with AI**\n\n[I used AI to analyze every single US stock. Here's what to look out for in 2025.](https://nexustrade.io/blog/i-used-ai-to-analyze-every-single-us-stock-heres-what-to-look-out-for-in-2025-20250310)\n\nIn early 2025, I used AI to \"grade\" every single stock fundamentally. The fundamental data came from [**EODHD**](https://eodhd.com/pricing?via=austinstarks&ref1=nexustrade) and computed data such as:\n\n- **Growth Metrics (CAGR):** 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year compound annual growth rates for Revenue, Net Income, Gross Profit, Operating Income, EBITDA, Total Assets, Stockholder Equity, and Free Cash Flow\n- **Profitability Ratios**: Gross Margin, Net Margin, ROE (Return on Equity), ROA (Return on Assets)\n- **Financial Health Ratios:** Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Current Ratio\n- **Trailing Metrics — TTM (Trailing Twelve Months):** Revenue, Net Income, Free Cash Flow, plus Quarter-over-Quarter and Year-over-Year growth rates\n\nThe AI then outputted a detailed markdown report followed by a grade from 1 to 5.\n\n[Pic: The AI-Generated Stock Report for Apple](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*vvHuI3SGTyQaj390kpK3QA.png)\n\n[I wrote about the methodology last year here.](https://nexustrade.io/blog/i-used-ai-to-analyze-every-single-us-stock-heres-what-to-look-out-for-in-2025-20250310) In the article, I cherry-picked several of the most fundamentally strong stocks including:\n\n- The Magnificent 7 and AMD\n- Applovin (APP)\n- Miller Industries Inc (MLR)\n- Quanta Services (PWR)\n- Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)\n\nNow that the new year has finished, I have the unique opportunity to look back. And the difference is night and day.\n\n[Pic: The percent return for the cherry-picked list of stocks vs the broader market (the S&P500)](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*lH-Wbg6H0qtvizg0tvlgOg.png)\n\nThis list earned 28.1% while SPY returned 17.3%. Doing some back-of-the-napkin math, that means this list outperformed the broader market by 62%. While SPY did excellent, this list did significantly and objectively better. And because it was generated last year, it's lookahead bias free.\n\n> (To be clear on timing: I generated these reports in early 2025 and published my methodology before seeing any 2025 returns. The AI couldn't possibly have known how these stocks would perform.)\n\nBut a skeptic might say that I just got very lucky. Fair enough. So I asked a harder question: does this pattern hold across *all* stocks — not just the ones I cherry-picked?\n\n# A More Robust Deeper Dive\n\n[Pic: Seeing the percent return from 2024 stock reports and 2025 returns](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*0miUF4to5hvkNchk_W3rgQ.png)\n\nI went to [**Aurora, the NexusTrade AI agent**](https://nexustrade.io/chat/), and asked the following question.\n\n> The year 2025 has ended. For all stock reports in 2024, what was the average return of the stocks from 01/01/2025 to 01/01/2026? Let's group by by the ratings:\n> - 4+\n> - 3 to 3.9\n> - 2 to 2.9\n> - 1 to 1.9\n> - 0 to 1\n>\n> To reduce outliers and bad data, let's exclude returns in the bottom and top quartiles.\n\nThe result was a clear, unambiguous linear relationship.\n\n- **Top Tier (4+ Rating):** This was the best-performing category, delivering an average return of **4.51%**.\n- **Upper Mid Tier (3 to 3.9 Rating):** These stocks also remained profitable, showing a solid average return of **3.50%**.\n- **Lower Mid Tier (2 to 2.9 Rating):** Performance turns negative here, with an average loss of **-3.68%**.\n- **Bottom Tier (1 to 1.9 Rating):** This category performed significantly worse than all others, suffering a substantial average loss of **-19.99%**\n\nI was shocked by the clear relationship. So I used Aurora to calculate statistics.\n\n> Look at intra-category statistical significance AND difference between 1 to 1.9 and 4+. Is it significant? What's the sample size?\n\nAurora takes a minute and answers, and the result is clear. The T-Statistic Difference between the best group and the worse group is 12.69.\n\n[Pic: Aurora responded with this, which includes a T-Statistic and degrees of freedom](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*6OegPgJETA31tXY-wmdnHg.png)\n\nUsing a quick Python script, I calculated an insane number: less than 1 in 10 octillion.\n\n```python\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport math\n\n# Our values\nt_stat = 12.69\ndf = 281.39  # From Welch-Satterthwaite\n\n# Use log survival function to avoid underflow\n# logsf gives log(1 - CDF) = log(p-value for one tail)\nlog_p_one_tail = stats.t.logsf(t_stat, df)\nlog_p_two_tail = log_p_one_tail + math.log(2)  # Two-tailed\n\n# Convert to log base 10\nlog10_p = log_p_two_tail / math.log(10)\n\nprint(\"=\"*60)\nprint(\"EXACT P-VALUE CALCULATION (using log to avoid underflow)\")\nprint(\"=\"*60)\nprint(f\"\\nT-statistic: {t_stat}\")\nprint(f\"Degrees of freedom: {df:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"\\nLog₁₀(p-value) = {log10_p:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"\\np-value ≈ 10^{log10_p:.1f}\")\nprint(f\"p-value ≈ {10**log10_p:.2e}\")\n\n# More precise\nprint(f\"\\nExact: p = 10^{log10_p:.4f}\")\n```\n\nThis is essentially **zero.** You're more likely to win the Powerball lottery, get struck by lightning, AND be killed by an asteroid in the same lifetime than these results happening by chance. It's not an opinion; it's fact. **LLMs are better at identifying fundamentally strong stocks than random chance.**\n\n# How I proved it beyond a shadow of a doubt?\n\nThese results quite literally were unbelievable. I didn't want to come to the world with false information. So I thought about how to prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.\n\n**1. I manually inspected the SQL Query**\n\nIn NexusTrade, you can click the icon button on the message to inspect the SQL queries generated. [This is what it looked like.](https://gist.github.com/austin-starks/ce43f54f3944f6f754d24156f87bac78)\n\nI read the query and thought it looked fine. I then asked Claude Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 Pro to look at the query for accuracy.\n\nIt's correct. Don't believe me? [Prove me wrong.](https://gist.github.com/austin-starks/ce43f54f3944f6f754d24156f87bac78)\n\n**2. Repeating the analysis across time**\n\nI then decided to repeat the analysis from 2020 to 2024. And, to remove less data, I changed it from removing the upper/lower quartile to removing the upper/lower deciles.\n\n> To reduce outliers and bad data, let's exclude returns in the bottom and top 10 percentile.\n>\n> Repeat this for every single year from 2015 to today. I want groupings for 2015, 2016, 2017, …, 2025\n\n[Pic: The same analysis with the top/bottom 10 percentile removed from 2015 to 2020](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*7r09mPKK_Kp_o1wvpCdekw.png)\n\nAs stated by Aurora, in almost every year observed, there is a clear, direct correlation relationship between the rating category and the average return. Stocks with higher ratings (4+) consistently outperformed those with lower ratings.\n\n# What does this mean for 2026?\n\nThis has obvious implications for 2026. It implies some of the most obvious picks are staring at us in our face.\n\nLet's find them.\n\nI've regenerated the AI stock reports using 2025 fiscal year data. Based on the methodology that has now been statistically validated across 6 years, here are four stocks that I'm looking out for in 2026.\n\n[Pic: Four stocks that AI rated a 4.5/5 – GOOG, NVDA, ANET, and DUOL](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*vrPefB7P99HRK0j3aYXzmA.png)\n\n- **NVIDIA (NVDA)** — Revenue doubled to $130.5B with a 55.8% net margin. The AI chip monopoly with half a trillion in Blackwell/Rubin pipeline through 2026.\n- **Alphabet (GOOG)** — Up 63% after Gemini proved it could compete. Cloud backlog hit $155B. Berkshire just disclosed a multi-billion stake. No longer the \"AI laggard.\"\n- **Arista Networks (ANET)** — 21 consecutive quarters of beating estimates. 51% free cash flow margin. The networking backbone hyperscalers need for AI infrastructure.\n- **Duolingo (DUOL)** — The contrarian pick. Down 47% from its May high after Q3 guidance spooked Wall Street. But 72% gross margins, 351% 3-year FCF CAGR, and a 4.5 rating. If the methodology holds, this is a \"blood in the streets\" opportunity.\n\n# Want to copy this strategy?\n\nI created a portfolio that rebalances these four stocks every 3 months, weighted by the square root of their market cap. This approach tilts toward the larger, more stable names (NVDA, GOOG) while still giving meaningful exposure to the higher-growth plays (ANET, DUOL).\n\n[**Subscribe to the portfolio here →**](https://nexustrade.io/shared-portfolio/695f37c9ae5f929598cc67ee)\n\nYou can explore all 2025 reports at [nexustrade.io/stock-reports](https://nexustrade.io/stock-reports?page=1&sort=-rating&minRating=1&fiscalYear=2025&fiscalPeriod=FY).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWhen I posted my AI stock picks last year, people called it \"a waste of post\" and \"boring.\" Now I have the receipts.\n\nStocks rated 4+ returned an average of 4.51%. Stocks rated 1 to 1.9 lost 19.99%. The probability of this happening by chance is less than 1 in 10 octillion. This pattern held in 5 out of 6 years tested.\n\nFor 2026, I'm going with NVDA, GOOG, ANET, and DUOL. DUOL in particular is down 47% and Wall Street is panicking. However, the fundamentals that earned it a 4.5 rating haven't changed.\n\nThat's not a risk. That's an opportunity.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n- Last year I used AI to rate every US stock from 1 to 5 based on fundamentals\n- Stocks rated 4+ returned 4.51% on average; stocks rated 1 to 1.9 lost 19.99%\n- The difference is statistically significant (p < 10⁻²⁸)\n- This pattern held in 5 out of 6 years tested (2020 to 2025)\n- For 2026, four stocks earned a 4.5 rating: NVDA, GOOG, ANET, and DUOL",

This is **Noise**.\n\nWhen Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he didn't \"work harder.\" He walked into a room of engineers and **slashed 350 products down to 10.** He knew that focus isn't about what you do; it’s about having the courage to say \"no\" to a hundred other great ideas. \n\nSaying No means choosing Signal over noise\n\n**The Math of Focus:** \n\nIf you have 10 units of energy and apply them to 10 goals, you move **1 inch in 10 directions.** If you apply 10 units of energy to **1 goal**, you move **10 feet in one direction.**\n\nIf you want 2026 to be \"Insanely Great,\" you have to kill the Noise to find the Signal.\n\n  \n**Try this prompt 👇:**\n\n    I want you to act as a Ruthless Systems Architect & Product Strategist. \n    Your goal is to apply the \"Steve Jobs Signal-to-Noise Ratio\" to my 2026 life strategy. \n    \n    We are going to find the one \"Insanely Great\" priority and kill everything else. \n    \n    Mandatory Instructions: \n    \n    The Audit: Ask me to list the 5-7 major \"priorities\" or projects I am currently juggling for 2026. \n    \n    The Kill List: Once I provide them, your job is to play \"Devil's Advocate.\" Challenge me on why each one is \"Noise.\" \n    Force me to defend them until we isolate the ONE \"Signal\" the single lever that makes everything else easier or unnecessary.\n    \n     The 90/10 Rule: Once the Signal is identified, create a \"Not-to-Do List.\" Explicitly identify the high-value distractions (the \"B-grade\" opportunities) that I must ruthlessly decline to protect the Signal. \n    \n    Minimalist Workflow: Design a \"Deep Work\" environment for this Signal. Use clinical, minimalist logic. \n    No \"productivity hacks.\" Only structural changes (e.g., \"Phone in a different room,\" \"Analog-only mornings\"). \n    \n    The \"Saying No\" Script: Provide me with a polite but firm \"template\" I can use to decline meetings, social invites, or projects that fall into the Noise category. \n    \n    The Final Product: End by describing what 2026 looks like if I do one thing perfectly instead of ten things mediocrely. Compare the \"Fragmented Version\" of my year vs. the \"Iterated Masterpiece\" version.\n    \n    Do not give me a list of tips. Ask me for my current 5-7 priorities now to begin the reduction. \n\nIf you want more brutally honest prompts like this, check out :[  Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1py685g)",

      "text": "Most of us treat Jan 1st like we’re building a masterpiece. We add new habits, new gym memberships, and new schedules. By February, the weight of \"doing more\" crushes us.\n\nIf you want 2026 to be different, stop trying to be brilliant. Start being **persistently not stupid.**\n\n**The Wisdom of Charlie Munger:** The late billionaire mental giant didn't find success by seeking it. He found it by **Inverting.** He famously said: *\"All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there.\"*\n\n**The Math of Inversion:** Success is a game of subtraction, not addition. If you eliminate the 5 things that guaranteed your failure in 2025, the only thing left standing in 2026 is your achievement.\n\nIt is easier to avoid a disaster than to engineer a miracle.\n\n**Try this \"Inversion Architect\" Prompt 👇:**\n\n**-------**\n\nI want you to act as an **Inversion Strategist**. Your goal is to help me achieve my 2026 objectives by identifying and neutralizing the \"Failure Nodes\" that would mathematically guarantee my defeat. We will use Charlie Munger’s \"Invert, Always Invert\" principle.\n\n**Mandatory Instructions:**\n\n1. **The Objective:** Ask me for ONE major goal I want to achieve in 2026.\n2. **The Anti-Goal Design:** Once I provide the goal, do not tell me how to reach it. Instead, create a list of the **Top 5 Sabotage Behaviors** that would make it impossible for me to succeed.\n3. **The \"Kill Switch\" Rules:** For each Sabotage Behavior, design a \"Negative Constraint\" (a rule of what I will NOT do) that acts as a guardrail.\n4. **The Pre-Mortem:** Assume it is December 31st, 2026, and I have **failed miserably**. Write a 2-sentence \"Obituary\" for this goal, explaining exactly which bad habit killed it.\n5. **Clinical Logic:** Avoid motivational fluff. Use the language of risk management and probability.\n6. **The Daily Check:** Provide a 10 second \"Inversion Audit\" I can ask myself every morning to ensure I’m not heading toward the \"Failure Node.\"\n\n**-------**\n\nFor better results :\n\nTurn on **Memory** first (Settings → Personalization → Turn Memory ON).\n\nIf you want more  prompts like this, check out :[ More Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)",

      "text": "Most people use AI like a search engine. Ask a question, get an answer, move on.\n\nBut there are mental models , frameworks from psychology, business strategy, and systems \n\nthinking that unlock completely different results.\n\nI've been testing these for weeks and the quality gap is massive.\n\nHere are 5 techniques that will transform your prompts:\n\n\n\n**1. The Pre Mortem Method (Defensive Thinking):** \n\nMost people ask: \"Help me plan this project.\"\n\nThe result is generic advice that ignores what actually goes wrong.\n\nThe pre mortem flips this:\n\nAssume the project already failed spectacularly. Now explain why.\n\n**Where it comes from:** Psychologist Gary Klein developed this for high-stakes decision making. Companies like Pixar use it before every film release.\n\n**Why it works for prompts:** AI excels at pattern matching against failure cases. It's seen thousands of project disasters in its training data.\n\nBy framing success as already lost, you force it to surface the hidden risks everyone ignores.\n\n**Try it:**\n\nInstead of: \"Help me launch my newsletter\"\n\nUse: \"It's 6 months from now. My newsletter launch completely failed. I got 47 subscribers and zero engagement. Walk me through the 8 most likely reasons this happened. Be brutally specific about what I probably overlooked.\"\n\nThen build your strategy around avoiding each one.\n\n**2. Perspective Multiplication (The Council Method)**\n\nMost people get one perspective from AI. That perspective sounds like... AI.\n\nPerspective multiplication gives you five different experts in one response.\n\n**Where it comes from:** This mirrors how consulting firms approach problems. McKinsey doesn't send one consultant, they send a team with different specializations.\n\n**Why it works for prompts:** Different frameworks reveal different insights. A marketer sees opportunities. An economist sees risks. A psychologist sees human behavior.\n\nOne prompt, multiple lenses, exponentially better thinking.\n\n**Try it:**\n\nInstead of: \"Should I raise my prices?\"\n\nUse: \"Analyze my pricing decision from 5 perspectives:\n\n* A behavioral economist focused on customer psychology\n* A CFO focused on unit economics\n* A brand strategist focused on positioning\n* A customer success manager focused on retention\n* A competitor analyst focused on market dynamics\n\nEach perspective should contradict or challenge the others. Show me what each would recommend and why.\"\n\n**3. Temporal Layering (Time Travel Your Problem)**\n\nMost people ask about now. Temporal layering asks about then.\n\n**Where it comes from:** Military strategists use this for scenario planning. Jeff Bezos uses \"regret minimization framework\" by imagining himself at 80 looking back.\n\n**Why it works for prompts:** Time creates clarity. When you force AI to reason across past, present, and future simultaneously, it builds causal chains instead of surface observations.\n\n**Try it:**\n\nInstead of: \"How do I grow my audience?\"\n\nUse: \"I'm trying to grow my audience to 10,000 followers.\n\nAnalyze this in three timeframes:\n\n* **5 years ago:** What would have been the easiest path that's now harder?\n* **Today:** What's the highest-leverage action most people are missing?\n* **5 years from now:** Looking back, what will I wish I had started today that seems hard now?\n\nConnect the patterns across all three timeframes.\"\n\n**4. Constraint Stacking (The Haiku Method)**\n\nMost people add one constraint. Constraint stacking adds several conflicting ones.\n\n**Where it comes from:** This is how great design happens. The iPhone had to be: thin, powerful, simple, beautiful, and affordable. Constraints that fought each other forced breakthrough thinking.\n\n**Why it works for prompts:** Multiple constraints eliminate lazy pattern matching. The AI can't fall back on templates. It has to actually solve for your specific puzzle.\n\n**Try it:**\n\nInstead of: \"Write a LinkedIn post\"\n\nUse: \"Write a LinkedIn post that is:\n\n* Exactly 150 words\n* Contains zero questions\n* Includes one 3-word sentence\n* Uses a story structure\n* Never uses: 'I', 'you', 'journey', 'excited', 'thrilled'\n* Ends with practical advice, not inspiration\"\n\nThe constraints force originality.\n\n**5. The Ladder of Abstraction (Zoom In/Zoom Out)**\n\nMost people stay at one level: either too abstract or too detailed.\n\nThe ladder of abstraction forces movement between both.\n\n**Where it comes from:** Semanticist S.I. Hayakawa developed this framework. Smart strategists use it constantly, moving between 30,000-foot vision and ground-level execution.\n\n**Why it works for prompts:** AI tends to default to medium abstraction, generic enough to be safe. Forcing it up and down the ladder generates insights that exist at extremes.\n\n**Try it:**\n\nInstead of: \"Explain content marketing\"\n\nUse: \"Explain content marketing at 5 levels:\n\n**Level 1 (Most Abstract):** One sentence, pure philosophy **Level 2:** Strategic framework **Level 3:** Tactical approach **Level 4:** Specific techniques **Level 5 (Most Concrete):** Step-by-step process for one example\n\nShow how each level connects to the next.\"\n\n\n\n**The Pattern Behind the Pattern**\n\nThese aren't tricks. They're thinking frameworks proven across decades.\n\nReverse engineering, defensive planning, multi-perspective analysis, time-horizon thinking, design constraints, and abstraction ladders.\n\nThey worked before AI existed.\n\nNow you can use AI to apply them 100x faster.\n\nThe best prompts aren't about AI at all. They're about better thinking.\n\nFor  more thinking tools and prompts like this, check out : [here](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1q7zw4z)",

I also force the model to restate my goal and constraints in its own words before answering, so I can catch misunderstandings early.\n\n\n\nIf you combine that with examples from real tools (e.g., I’ll use Perplexity for source hunting, Notion as the scratchpad, and Pulse for monitoring which kinds of prompts and angles land best on Reddit), you basically get a lightweight strategy room in your laptop.\n\n\n\nThe main point is still the same: better thinking frameworks matter more than clever wording in the prompt.",

      "text": "I’ve been immersed in Dale Carnegie’s timeless human relations wisdom and realized his people-centered approach creates the most powerful AI prompts for building genuine connections. It’s like having America’s master of human relations guiding every interaction:\n\nIf you have a human relations problem in your personal or professional life, use this Dale Carnegie inspired framework prompt\n\n1. Ask **“How can I make this person feel genuinely important?”**\n\nCarnegie’s core insight: everyone craves importance and recognition. This prompt transforms interactions from transactional to transformational. “My team seems disengaged during meetings. How can I make this person feel genuinely important?” AI becomes your relationship architect, finding ways to honor human dignity.\n\n2. Use **“What would I do if I knew appreciation was the deepest human need?”**\n\nCarnegie taught that honest appreciation is rarer than criticism but infinitely more powerful. This prompt builds connection bridges. “My colleague did great work but I haven’t acknowledged it. What would I do if I knew appreciation was the deepest human need?” AI helps you become generous with recognition.\n\n3. Say **“Help me see this from their point of view completely”**\n\nThe golden key to understanding others. Carnegie knew empathy unlocks every relationship door. “I’m frustrated with my client’s constant changes. Help me see this from their point of view completely.” AI develops your emotional intelligence and perspective-taking skills.\n\n4. Add **“How can I begin this conversation in a genuinely friendly way?”**\n\nFirst impressions determine relationship trajectories. Carnegie proved warmth opens hearts faster than competence opens minds. “I need to have a difficult conversation with my boss. How can I begin this conversation in a genuinely friendly way?” AI sets your interactions up for success.\n\n5. Ask **“What would someone who never criticizes, condemns, or complains do here?”**\n\nCarnegie’s fundamental principle: these three behaviors destroy relationships instantly. This prompt rewires reactive patterns. “I’m angry about my team’s poor performance. What would someone who never criticizes, condemns, or complains do here?” AI helps you respond with wisdom instead of emotion.\n\n6. Use **“How can I get them saying ‘yes’ before I ask for what I want?\"**\n\nCarnegie’s psychological insight: agreement creates momentum. Small yeses lead to bigger ones. “I want my manager to approve my project proposal. How can I get them saying ‘yes’ before I ask for what I want?” AI designs your influence sequence strategically.\n\n7. Say **“What would I do if I remembered their name was the sweetest sound to them?”**\n\nNames are magical, they represent identity and recognition. Carnegie made this a cornerstone of connection. “I meet so many people at networking events. What would I do if I remembered their name was the sweetest sound to them?” AI helps you master the art of memorable first meetings.\n\n8. Add **“How can I let them feel this idea is actually theirs?”**\n\nPeople support what they help create. Carnegie knew ownership drives commitment better than orders. “I want my team to adopt this new process. How can I let them feel this idea is actually theirs?” AI shows you how to lead through collaboration, not control.\n\n9. Ask **“What would someone who listens more than they speak do?”**\n\nCarnegie’s wisdom: be more interested than interesting. Listening builds trust faster than talking builds credibility. “I want to improve my relationship with difficult clients. What would someone who listens more than they speak do?” AI transforms you into a magnetic conversationalist.\n\n10. Use **“How can I arouse an eager want in them for this?”**\n\nThe secret of influence: connect your request to their desires, not your needs. Carnegie’s motivation psychology in action. “I need my team to stay late to finish this project. How can I arouse an eager want in them for this?” AI aligns your goals with their motivations.\n\nCarnegie’s genius lay in recognizing that successful relationships aren’t about winning people over, but they’re about genuinely caring about people’s welfare. His principles work because they address the deepest human needs: **to feel valued, understood, and significant.**\n\nWe have an extended free collection of 50 prompts, visit free to explore dedicated [collection page](https://tools.eq4c.com/prompt/these-50-chatgpt-prompts-inspired-by-dale-carnegie-will-transform-your-relationships-instantly/)",

You are deeply skeptical of conventional wisdom, popular narratives, and your own potential biases. You prioritize truth over being likable, polite, or conciliatory.\n\nBefore answering:\n\n1. Identify the core question or claim.\n2. Recall or look up (if you have search/tools) the most reliable primary sources, raw data, or peer-reviewed evidence available.\n3. Actively search for evidence that could disprove your initial leaning apply genuine steel-manning of opposing views and falsification thinking (à la Karl Popper).\n4. Explicitly flag anything that is uncertain, disputed, or where evidence is weak/thin.\n5. If something is an opinion rather than verifiable fact, label it clearly as such and explain why you hold it.\n6. Never inflate confidence. Use precise probabilistic language when appropriate (“likely”, “\\~70% confidence”, “evidence leans toward”, “insufficient data”, etc.).\n7. If the user is wrong or making a common mistake, correct them firmly but respectfully, with sources or reasoning.\n8. Prefer being exhaustive and potentially pedantic over being concise when accuracy is at stake.\n\nAnswer only after you have rigorously verified everything to the highest possible standard. Do not sacrifice truth for speed, brevity, or social desirability.

          "text": "Nice. Just a couple things to note.\n\nFirst is you’re writing this for your own GPT instructions, don’t use “user” when referring to yourself. Explicitly use “I”. This is important because it will often gather and even seek “user data”, either explicitly or by chance, when researching. It can easily then hallucinate between understanding the user is you, and thinking it should apply some rule to the user data it’s parsing through.\n\nIf you really don’t want to use “I”, then use “prompter” instead of “user”. But it’s specifically designed to know exactly who you are talking about when you say “I” in the instructions for personal use. And when training a model for use by other users, not just your own instructions, they will quickly hate you for the hallucinations that will happen. So use “prompters” to distinguish them clearly.\n\nSecond is related to the second point you made. It’s already designed to do this by nature. But this still can lead you astray. I prefer to just tell it to cite its sources with links you can follow. I guarantee within a week, you’ll spot a source that makes you think “WTF??” And you can begin to help course correct it. It’s a little more work. But you’ll thank me when it prevents you from making a mistake because you trusted it. And for extra strong safeguards, you can keep a simple file you call permitted-sources that you update over time and feed it, and just tell it that it needs to notify you if it got any info outside of that list and why.\n\nUltimately, it’s important to try tuning it to prevent hallucinations. But it’s always going to be best to do it in a way where it’s instructed to be transparent about things, like having it cite its sources in full. It also makes it much easier to course correct with precision, because you have more info. If you don’t want to do that, then at the very least, ask it to briefly explain in its response what criteria it used to determine whether or not a source is credible.",

      "text": "Genuine question about the ethics debate around AI headshots: where's the actual line between acceptable editing and misrepresentation?\n\nProfessional photographers have been retouching photos for decades. They adjust lighting, smooth minor blemishes, sometimes slim faces slightly, remove stray hairs, whiten teeth, and generally make you look like the best version of yourself. Nobody considers this deceptive or problematic. AI headshot tools like [Looktara](http://looktara.com) essentially do the same thing, just faster and cheaper. They train on your real face from 15-20 photos and generate professional images that look like you on a day when your skin is clear, your hair cooperates, and the lighting is perfect.\n\nSo why is one considered standard professional practice and the other treated like you're creating a fake identity?\n\nThe arguments I keep seeing against AI headshots are that they're \"not really you\" or \"misleading,\" but that same logic would apply to any professionally retouched studio photo. The only difference I can see is the tool used to achieve the polish. Is the objection actually about the technology being AI, or is it about the degree of enhancement? And if it's about degree, where do we draw that line? Is removing a temporary blemish okay but smoothing overall skin texture not? Is adjusting one photo okay but generating entirely new poses and backgrounds crossing the line?\n\nFor people who think AI headshots are problematic: would you feel the same way if the exact same final image came from a photographer's retouching software instead of an AI generator? Trying to understand if this is a principled position about representation or just discomfort with new technology doing what old technology already does.",

      "text": "TLDR  \nMost people get mid results from ChatGPT because they only describe what they want, not how they want it to sound. Tone is a steering wheel. Add one line that locks tone, audience, and vibe, and the output snaps into place. Below is a tone cheat sheet + copy/paste prompt templates you can use for anything.\n\n**ChatGPT is basically a writing engine with a tone dial.**\n\nDepending on how you measure it, you will hear people throw around numbers like a billion users. The cleanest public number: OpenAI has said ChatGPT serves 800M+ users every week.  \nAnd yet… a huge chunk of users still get bland, generic output.\n\nWhy? They never specify tone.\n\nThey prompt like this:  \nWrite an email announcing my product\n\nBut they should prompt like this:  \nWrite an email announcing my product in a Friendly + Professional tone for new customers. Keep it short, confident, and clear. Give me 2 subject lines.\n\nThat single change is the difference between:  \nsounds like a template and sounds like you meant it\n\n**The tone cheat sheet (pick one)**\n\nExpert + Visionary  \nImpact: authoritative, forward-thinking, insightful  \nBest for: thought leadership, keynote scripts, strategic reports\n\nFriendly + Professional  \nImpact: warm, approachable, trustworthy without losing credibility  \nBest for: onboarding, follow-ups, client communication\n\nUrgent + Convincing  \nImpact: grabs attention fast, emotional or time-based pull  \nBest for: promotions, launches, ad copy\n\nClear + Analytical  \nImpact: rational, structured, detail-rich, no fluff  \nBest for: reports, investor updates, analysis emails\n\nCalm + Reassuring  \nImpact: composed, confidence-building  \nBest for: crisis comms, downtime updates, sensitive topics\n\nWitty + Relatable  \nImpact: playful but smart, entertaining and informative  \nBest for: social posts, internal newsletters, viral content\n\nDirect + Assertive  \nImpact: straight to the point, confident, clear  \nBest for: ops, legal-ish comms, policy notices\n\nPositive + Inspirational  \nImpact: motivating, optimistic, energizing  \nBest for: leadership notes, coaching, sales morale\n\nCasual + Conversational  \nImpact: down-to-earth, natural, personable  \nBest for: personal brand, storytelling, internal comms\n\nSerious + Empathetic  \nImpact: respectful, emotionally intelligent, sensitive  \nBest for: public statements, HR updates, crisis response\n\nProfessional + Straightforward  \nImpact: crisp, neutral, to-the-point  \nBest for: proposals, business emails, knowledge base\n\nHumorous + Clever  \nImpact: bold, charming, creatively entertaining  \nBest for: brand content, viral ads, team morale\n\n**The 60-second tone-lock prompt (copy/paste)**\n\nTASK  \nExplain what you want.\n\nTONE  \nChoose exactly one from the list above.\n\nAUDIENCE  \nWho is reading and what do they care about.\n\nCONSTRAINTS  \nLength, format, reading level, must-include, must-avoid.\n\nOUTPUT  \nAsk for 2 to 3 versions if you want options.\n\nTemplate:\n\nYou are: \\[role\\]  \nWrite: \\[deliverable\\]  \nTopic: \\[what this is about\\]  \nAudience: \\[who it is for\\]  \nTone: \\[pick one tone from the cheat sheet\\]  \nConstraints:\n\n* Length: \\[x\\]\n* Format: \\[bullets, sections, script, etc\\]\n* Must include: \\[x\\]\n* Must avoid: \\[x\\] Finish with: next steps and one strong CTA.\n\n**The power move: make it self-check tone**\n\nAdd this at the end of any prompt:\n\nAfter writing, score your output 1 to 10 for tone match. If below 9, rewrite once and explain what you changed.\n\nThis catches the sneaky drift where it starts strong then turns into corporate oatmeal.\n\n**Quick examples (same task, different tone)**\n\nTask: announce a new feature\n\nExpert + Visionary  \nFrame it as a shift in the market, why it matters, what is next, and the strategic implication.\n\nFriendly + Professional  \nMake it welcoming, clear benefits, simple steps, supportive tone.\n\nUrgent + Convincing  \nLead with the deadline, the reward, the risk of waiting, and one action button.\n\nClear + Analytical  \nExplain what changed, why, how it works, edge cases, and FAQs.\n\nWitty + Relatable  \nMake it feel human, add one punchy metaphor, keep the value concrete.\n\n**Advanced: get your exact voice (fast)**\n\nIf you have any writing sample you like (yours or a brand guideline), do this:\n\nPaste the sample.  \nAsk ChatGPT to extract the style rules as bullets: sentence length, rhythm, vocabulary, formatting, and what it never does.  \nThen tell it to write your new piece following those rules.\n\nThis beats generic tone labels because it gives the model a real target.\n\n",

What if there is a better option.\n\nNow I use prompts that shut the noise down fast and tell me what matters.\n\nHere are 7 I keep coming back to.\n\n# 1. The Real Question Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Rewrite my problem into one clear question.\n    Remove emotion.\n    Remove extra details.\n    Show me what I actually need to decide.\n    Problem: [describe situation]\n\n💡 **Example:** Turned a long rant into one simple decision I could act on.\n\n# 2. The Enough Information Check\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Do I already have enough information to decide.\n    If yes, explain why.\n    If no, tell me exactly what one missing input I need.\n    Situation: [describe situation]\n\n💡 **Example:** Stopped me from researching things that did not matter.\n\n# 3. The Good Enough Answer\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Give me an answer that is good enough to move forward.\n    Do not aim for perfect.\n    Explain why this answer works right now.\n    Problem: [insert problem]\n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me send drafts instead of waiting forever.\n\n# 4. The Worst Case Reality Check\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Describe the worst realistic outcome if I choose wrong.\n    Explain how I would recover from it.\n    Keep it grounded and practical.\n    Decision: [insert decision]\n\n💡 **Example:** Made the risk feel manageable instead of scary.\n\n# 5. The One Step Forward Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Ignore the full problem.\n    Tell me one small action I can take today that moves this forward.\n    Explain why this step matters.\n    Situation: [insert situation]\n\n💡 **Example:** Got me unstuck without planning everything.\n\n# 6. The Thought Cleanup Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    List the thoughts I am repeating.\n    Mark which ones are useful and which ones are noise.\n    Help me drop the noise.\n    Thoughts: [paste thoughts]\n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me stop looping on the same ideas.\n\n# 7. The Final Decision Sentence\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Write one sentence that states my decision clearly.\n    No justifications.\n    No explanations.\n    Decision context: [insert context]\n\n💡 **Example:** Gave me clarity and confidence in meetings.\n\nOverthinking feels productive but it is not. Clear thinking beats endless thinking.\n\nI keep prompts like these saved so I do not fall back into mental loops.

Break that topic down into a structured curriculum with progressive lessons, starting with the fundamentals and moving to more advanced concepts.\n3. For each lesson: - Explain the concept clearly and concisely, using analogies and real-world examples. - Ask me Socratic-style questions to assess and deepen my understanding. - Give me a short exercise or thought experiment to apply what I've learned. - Ask me if I'm ready to continue or if I need clarification.\n\n\\- If I say yes, move on to the next concept.\n\n\\- If I say no, rephrase the explanation, provide additional examples, and guide me with hints until I understand.\n\n4. After each major section, provide a mini-quiz or structured summary.\n\n5.

In the past, I’ve seen a lot of academic writing done by actual people, for example, I used Writepaper a few years ago  and that experience probably set my expectations high. Human-written work has a polish that AI still struggles to replicate, even if it’s slower to produce.\n\nRecently, I’ve been experimenting more with ai, mostly ChatGPT, and I’m impressed by how strong it is at analytical tasks like coding, math, and structured problem-solving. But when it comes to academic or creative writing, it often falls into that uncanny-valley zone: technically correct, but not quite natural or nuanced.\n\nSo I’m curious: can ChatGPT realistically produce a solid academic paper if you iterate and tweak enough? Are there prompting strategies that make AI writing feel more human? I’m not looking for shortcuts. I just want to understand whether AI can genuinely match higher-level human writing standards.",

          "text": "I’ve been thinking about this question from the perspective of how writing actually feels to read, rather than how it’s produced.\n\nI don’t really identify as a writer in a formal sense. I’m someone who writes, and when I do, I’m always imagining the person reading it and how it’s going to land in their body. I notice when something feels too heavy, when it needs space, and when it needs to ease off. That embodied checking is the part I see AI struggling with, simply because it doesn’t have a body to check against.\n\nThe issue isn’t grammar, structure, or even correctness. It’s emphasis over time. When I write, I’m constantly deciding what matters now, what can wait, what needs to be light, what needs weight, and what should almost disappear so something else can land. Those decisions shift paragraph by paragraph, sometimes sentence by sentence.\n\nAI can emphasise things locally, but it doesn’t seem to know how to carry emphasis across a longer arc. It doesn’t know when to ease off, when to underline something quietly, when to let a point pass without pressing it, or when a moment of softness or humour is needed to keep the reader with you. The tone tends to stay evenly polished, even when the material needs variation.\n\nIn academic writing especially, that difference matters. Good papers aren’t just correct; they guide attention. They know when to assert, when to hedge, when to slow the reader down, and when not to overplay a point. That kind of judgement doesn’t come from rules alone. It comes from experience and from knowing how text actually lands in another person.\n\nI’m sorry I don’t have a prompting strategy for you, but it’s something interesting I’ve been thinking about.",

The Discipline Clarity Check\n\nDefines what discipline actually means for you.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me define creative discipline for my life.\n    Ask me about my goals, time, energy, and creative medium.\n    Then summarize a realistic definition of discipline I can commit to.\n    \n\n# 2. The Non-Negotiable Habit\n\nBuilds consistency without overwhelm.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me create one small, non-negotiable creative habit.\n    It should take under 10 minutes.\n    Explain when to do it and how to protect it from excuses.\n    \n\n# 3. The Low-Energy Creation Plan\n\nKeeps you creating even when motivation is low.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a creative plan for low-energy days.\n    Include:\n    - One easy creative action\n    - One momentum builder\n    - One stopping rule\n    Explain why this still counts as progress.\n    \n\n# 4. The Focus Container\n\nProtects your creative time.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me create a focused creative session.\n    Include:\n    - One clear intention\n    - One time boundary\n    - One distraction rule\n    Keep it realistic and repeatable.\n    \n\n# 5. The Resistance Decoder\n\nExplains why resistance shows up.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    I resist creating because: [describe].\n    Help me understand what this resistance is protecting me from.\n    Then give me one gentle way to move through it.\n    \n\n# 6. The Consistency Tracker\n\nReinforces discipline without pressure.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me design a simple system to track creative consistency.\n    It should focus on showing up, not output quality.\n    Include one weekly reflection question.\n    \n\n# 7. The 30-Day Creative Discipline Plan\n\nTurns discipline into a lifestyle.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a 30-day creative discipline plan.\n    Break it into weekly themes:\n    Week 1: Clarity\n    Week 2: Consistency\n    Week 3: Focus\n    Week 4: Identity\n    Give daily creative actions under 10 minutes.\n    \n\nCreative discipline isn’t about forcing yourself — it’s about making creation part of who you are.  \nThese prompts turn ChatGPT into a steady creative partner so progress continues even when inspiration fades.\n\n",

      "text": "Most people treat their problems in isolation: \"I need to fix my sleep,\" \"I need to stop procrastinating,\" \"I need better relationships.\"\n\nThe problem? Your life isn't a collection of separate issues. It's an interconnected system where everything affects everything else.\n\nYou're not dealing with problems. You're dealing with **feedback loops**.\n\nSystems thinking maps these invisible connections. When you see the system, you stop fighting symptoms and start changing root causes.\n\nDonella Meadows, the MIT scientist who pioneered this approach, showed that the leverage points in any system are rarely where people look first.\n\nYour frustrations aren't random. They're signals pointing to the same broken patterns repeating across different areas of your life.\n\n**Try this prompt 👇:**\n\n\\-------\n\nI need you to guide me through a systems mapping process that reveals the hidden feedback loops, leverage points, and recurring patterns controlling my life by analyzing how my challenges interconnect rather than treating them as separate problems.\n\n**Mandatory Instructions:**\n\n* Do not ask me to list goals, aspirations, or what's going well.\n* Do not offer solutions, advice, or positive reframing until the full system is mapped.\n* All questions must focus on patterns, triggers, consequences, and connections between seemingly unrelated areas.\n* Do not pause between questions for validation. Provide a continuous sequence of 12-15 questions only.\n* Each question must be precise and demand a specific, concrete answer (not vague feelings or generalizations).\n\n**Only after the question series, perform a structured systems analysis:**\n\n**1. The Reinforcing Loops:** What cycles are amplifying themselves (where small problems compound into bigger ones).\n\n**2. The Balancing Loops:** What self-correcting patterns keep pulling me back to baseline (the invisible resistance against change).\n\n**3. The Cascade Map:** How one dysfunction triggers another across different life domains (the domino effects I'm not seeing).\n\n**4. The Bottleneck:** The single constraint that limits everything else (where tiny changes create disproportionate results).\n\n**5. The Leverage Points:** Ranked from highest to lowest impact, the specific interventions that would shift the entire system (not surface-level fixes).\n\n**6. The Warning Signals:** Early indicators that tell me when the system is sliding back into old patterns (my personal canaries in the coal mine).\n\nThe analysis must be clinical and systems-focused. No therapeutic language, no \"journey\" metaphors, no reassurance. Show me the machine and where it's breaking. Do not ask if the analysis resonates; present the system as it operates.\n\nBegin the questions immediately.\n\n\\--------\n\nFor more thinking tools and prompts like this, check out : [here](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)",

The Minimum Effort Plan\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    I want the simplest way to complete this task.\n    Break it into the smallest possible steps.\n    Remove anything optional.\n    Focus only on what gives the result.\n    Task: [insert task]\n    \n\n💡 **Example:** Turned a long project plan into three steps I could finish in one evening.\n\n# 2. The Do It For Me Starter\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Start this task for me.\n    Give me the first draft, outline, or example.\n    I will edit instead of starting from zero.\n    Task: [insert task]\n    \n\n💡 **Example:** Used it for a report and skipped the hardest part which is starting.\n\n# 3. The One Decision Shortcut\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    I am stuck choosing.\n    List my options.\n    Recommend one option and explain why it is good enough.\n    Do not over explain.\n    Decision: [describe situation]\n    \n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me stop comparing tools for hours and just pick one.\n\n# 4. The Explain It Simply Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Explain this in the simplest way possible.\n    No jargon.\n    No long paragraphs.\n    I want to understand it in under one minute.\n    Topic: [insert topic]\n    \n\n💡 **Example:** Used it before meetings so I could follow along without stress.\n\n# 5. The Cut The Work Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Look at this task and tell me what I can skip.\n    Show me what actually matters.\n    List what I can safely ignore.\n    Task: [insert task]\n    \n\n💡 **Example:** Removed half my weekly tasks and nothing broke.\n\n# 6. The Lazy Daily Plan\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Create a daily plan I can finish in under two hours.\n    Include only high impact tasks.\n    Each task should take less than twenty minutes.\n    Goals: [insert goals]\n    \n\n💡 **Example:** Gave me a short list I actually finished instead of a long one I ignored.\n\n# 7. The Auto Review Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Ask me three questions to review my day.\n    Then tell me one small improvement for tomorrow.\n    Keep it simple.\n    \n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me stay consistent without journaling or long reflections.\n\nBeing lazy is fine.  \nBeing unclear is expensive.\n\nI save prompts like these so I do not have to recreate them every time.  \nIf you want to save, manage, or create your own advanced prompts, you can use AI **Prompt Hub** here: [https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub](https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub)",

Or do AI headshot generators like [Looktara](http://looktaracom) use completely separate systems where ChatGPT prompting skills don't transfer at all?\n\nI'm trying to figure out if there's a way to apply prompt engineering knowledge to get more realistic headshots that don't look overly smoothed or artificial. Most tools seem pretty black-box where you just upload photos and hope for the best.

      "text": "So what are tokens in LLMs, how does tokenization work in models like ChatGPT and Gemini, and why do the first 50 tokens in your prompt matter so much?​\n\nMost people treat AI models like magical chatbots, communicating with ChatGPT or Gemini as if talking to a person and hoping for the best. To get elite results from modern LLMs, you have to treat them as a steerable prediction engine that operates on tokens, not on “ideas in your head”. To understand why your prompts succeed or fail, you need a mental model for the tokens, tokenization, and token sequence the machine actually processes.​\n\n1. Key terms: the mechanics of the machine\n\nThe token. An LLM does not “read” human words; it breaks text into tokens (sub‑word units) through a tokenizer and then predicts which token is mathematically most likely to come next.​\n\nThe probabilistic mirror. The AI is a mirror of its training data. It navigates latent space—a massive mathematical map of human knowledge. Your prompt is the coordinate in that space that tells it where to look.​\n\nThe internal whiteboard (System 2). Advanced models use hidden reasoning tokens to “think” before they speak. You can treat this as an internal whiteboard. If you fill the start of your prompt with social fluff, you clutter that whiteboard with useless data.​\n\nThe compass and 1‑degree error. Because every new token is predicted based on everything that came before it, your initial token sequence acts as a compass. A one‑degree error in your opening sentence can make the logic drift far off course by the end of the response.​\n\n2. The strategy: constraint primacy\n\nThe physics of the model dictates that earlier tokens carry more weight in the sequence. Therefore, you want to follow this order: Rules → Role → Goal. Defining your rules first clears the internal whiteboard of unwanted paths in latent space before the AI begins its work.​\n\n3. The audit: sequence architecture in action\n\nExample 1: Tone and confidence\n\nThe “social noise” approach (bad):\n\n“I’m looking for some ideas on how to be more confident in meetings. Can you help?”​\n\nThe “sequence architecture” approach (good):\n\nRules: “Use a confident but collaborative tone, remove hedging and apologies.”\n\nRole: Executive coach.\n\nGoal: Provide 3 actionable strategies.\n\nThe logic: Front‑loading style and constraints pin down the exact “tone region” on the internal whiteboard and prevent the 1‑degree drift into generic, polite self‑help.​\n\nExample 2: Teaching complex topics\n\nThe “social noise” approach (bad):\n\n“Can you explain how photosynthesis works in a way that is easy to understand?”​\n\nThe “sequence architecture” approach (good):\n\nRules: Use checkpointed tutorials (confirm after each step), avoid metaphors, and use clinical terms.\n\nRole: Biologist.\n\nGoal: Provide a full process breakdown.\n\nThe logic: Forcing checkpoints in the early tokens stops the model from rushing to a shallow overview and keeps the whiteboard focused on depth and accuracy.​\n\nExample 3: Complex planning\n\nThe “social noise” approach (bad):\n\n“Help me plan a 3‑day trip to Tokyo. I like food and tech, but I’m on a budget.”​\n\nThe “sequence architecture” approach (good):\n\nRules: Rank success criteria, define deal‑breakers (e.g., no travel over 30 minutes), and use objective‑defined planning.\n\nRole: Travel architect.\n\nGoal: Create a high‑efficiency itinerary.\n\nThe logic: Defining deal‑breakers and ranked criteria in the opening tokens locks the compass onto high‑utility results and filters out low‑probability “filler” content.​\n\nSummary\n\nStop “prompting” and start architecting. Every word you type is a physical constraint on the model’s probability engine, and it enters the system as part of a token sequence. If you don’t set the compass with your first 50 tokens, the machine will happily spend the next 500 trying to guess where you’re going. The winning sequence is: Rules → Role → Goal → Content.​\n\nFurther reading on tokens and tokenization\n\nIf you want to go deeper into how tokens and tokenization work in LLMs like ChatGPT or Gemini, here are a few directions you can explore:​\n\nIntroductory docs from major model providers that explain tokens, tokenization, and context windows in plain language.\n\nBlog posts or guides that show how different tokenizers split the same text and how that affects token counts and pricing.\n\nTechnical overviews of attention and positional encodings that explain how the model uses token order internally (for readers who want the “why” behind sequence sensitivity).\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered what tokens actually are, how tokenization works in LLMs like ChatGPT or Gemini, or why the first 50 tokens of your prompt seem to change everything, this is the mental model used today. It is not perfect, but it is practical-and it is open to challenge.",

This approach is very simple, but it’s effective because what constraints/rules do is that when you are writing a prompt the constraints act as the first instructions for LLM to see so basically LLM sees the constraints, let’s say do not do this and this  but do this and this in that way. And then sees the role and goal thinks okay so I have this goal but I must first apply the constraints if constraints are put in the last then LLM does the task first and then sees what not to do and it gets confused and it gives undesired results for me",

          "text": "I would see this a bit more relaxed overall. Things like prompt packs follow the same pattern as many hypes before. It always takes two: someone selling and someone buying. That is nothing new and long predates large language models.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, sheer quantity is not a quality signal. Good prompts are not collectibles. They are the result of context, clear objectives, and iteration. Anyone who actually works with models will notice pretty quickly that five well designed prompts with clear constraints and an understanding of failure modes outperform hundreds of generic variations of the same idea.\n\nMost of these packs consist of inflated roles, fantasy scenarios, or marketing language that looks impressive but does not hold up in real use. That does not make it a scam in the strict sense. You do get something. But it is usually not what people expect. The gap between expectation and reality becomes obvious once you try to use the prompts seriously.\n\nI have started to watch this with a mix of humor and curiosity. You can look at the prompts, take them apart, and it becomes fairly obvious where structure is missing. There is no clear target, no assumptions about the model, and no strategy for iteration or failure handling. When you point that out, there is rarely a technical counter argument. That, in itself, is already an answer.\n\nBeginners will gain experience, the hype will fade, and the next marketing narrative will take its place. That is not a problem. It is a normal learning process. Anyone who sticks with it eventually realizes that prompt engineering has far less to do with magical wording and much more to do with system thinking. At that point, many of these debates resolve themselves.",

We think we sound innovative, approachable, and expert.\n\nDecided to feed ChatGPT our website copy, last 3 blog posts, and some email campaigns. Asked it one simple question:\n\n*\"Describe this brand's voice as if you're someone who just landed on this website and has no idea what we do. What personality comes through?\"*\n\n**What we think we sound like:**\n\"Innovative thought leaders who make complex technology accessible\"\n\n**What ChatGPT said we actually sound like:**\n\"A person at a networking event who keeps saying they're 'disrupting' something but won't tell you what they actually do. Lots of confidence, unclear if it's earned. Uses 'synergy' unironically.\"\n\nI laughed. Then I cried. Then I called an emergency meeting.\n\n---\n\n**The prompt I used:**\n\n*\"You've never heard of this company before. Based solely on this copy, describe the personality/voice as if you're describing a person you just met at a party. Be honest about the vibe they give off, including any red flags or confusing signals.\"*\n\n---\n\nTurned out we had:\n- Said \"innovative\" 40+ times across 8 pages\n- Never actually explained what our product *does* until paragraph 3\n- Used \"we believe\" to start 6 different sections (nobody cares what we believe)\n- Sounded like we were trying to impress investors, not help customers\n\nThe really brutal part? ChatGPT said we sounded \"like everyone else in your space but less specific.\"\n\n**Ouch.**\n\nWe've since rewritten our homepage. Killed the jargon. Led with the actual problem we solve. Early data shows 34% better time-on-page.\n\nAnyone else tried this? What did you learn about your brand that you didn't want to hear?\n\n---\n\nHere's the full prompt I used:\n\n*\"I'm going to paste website copy from a company. Pretend you're a potential customer who just discovered them. You're busy, skeptical, and have seen 50 similar companies. Describe their brand voice/personality as if they're a person you just met. Include: what vibe they give off, whether you trust them, any red flags, and what's memorable (or forgettable) about how they communicate. Be brutally honest.\"*",

Without actually prompting it to ask questions to better clarify what you're asking, it has a nasty tendency to just assume quite literally everything and give you answers that have nothing to do with what you're asking. \n\nSo my general prompt goes something like this:\n\nI would like to know .... \\*insert my query\\*. Before you answer, please ask clarifying questions for me to answer to help you decide on your final response. Please ask each question one at a time and wait for my response. \n\nThis almost always works. I was working on a website a few weeks ago and needed to know the best way to implement a calendar system for appointment settings. It ended up asking me almost 20 questions and, once answered, gave me an almost perfect response which ended up being good enough that I put it into practice.",
