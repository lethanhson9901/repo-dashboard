      "text": "I used to leave work tired even on easy days.\n\nNot because the work was hard. Because everything took longer than it should.\n\nNow I keep a small set of prompts that help me finish faster and sound more put together.\n\nHere are 7 I actually use at work.\n\n# 1. The Clear Task Breakdown\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Break this task into the smallest possible steps.\n    Order them so I can finish fast.\n    Skip anything optional.\n    Task: [paste task]\n\n💡 **Example:** Turned a vague request into a simple checklist I could follow.\n\nBy the way,  I keep prompts like these saved so I do not repeat thinking every day at [AISuperHub](https://www.aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub)\n\n# 2. The Fast Decision Helper\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    I need to decide between these options.\n    List pros and cons briefly.\n    Then tell me which option makes sense and why.\n    Options: [list options]\n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me decide quickly instead of overthinking.\n\n# 3. The Email Reply Shortcut\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Write a short, clear reply to this email.\n    Keep it polite and direct.\n    Do not add extra explanation.\n    Email: [paste email]\n\n💡 **Example:** Replied in minutes instead of rewriting drafts.\n\n# 4. The Meeting Prep Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    I have a meeting about [topic].\n    Give me:\n    1. Three talking points\n    2. One smart question to ask\n    3. One risk to mention if needed\n\n💡 **Example:** Walked into meetings prepared without stress.\n\n# 5. The Manager Update Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Turn this into a clear status update for my manager.\n    Use short sentences.\n    Focus on progress, blockers, and next steps.\n    Text: [paste notes]\n\n💡 **Example:** Made updates easy and professional.\n\n# 6. The Problem Framer\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Help me explain this problem clearly at work.\n    Structure it as:\n    1. What is happening\n    2. Why it matters\n    3. What I suggest we do\n    Problem: [describe issue]\n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me speak up without rambling.\n\n# 7. The Time Saver Review\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Look at this work.\n    Tell me what can be simplified or removed.\n    Only suggest changes that save time.\n    Content: [paste content]\n\n💡 **Example:** Cut unnecessary work before submitting.\n\nWork feels lighter when things are clear.",

      "text": "Your charts are boring people to sleep\n\nMost charts fail for the same reason: they answer no real question.\n\nThey show data… but they don’t reveal a decision.\n\nWhat you actually want is this:\n\n* One chart = one question\n* One chart = one takeaway\n* One chart = one action\n\nAnd yes, ChatGPT can help you get there in minutes.\n\nBut only if you stop prompting like this:  \nMake a chart of my data\n\n…and start prompting like this:  \nHere’s the decision this chart needs to enable. Here’s the audience. Here’s what counts as a good chart. Now build and critique it until it’s obvious.\n\nThat’s how you go from boring to boardroom.\n\n**The ChatGPT prompt that turns spreadsheets into stunning charts that are actually useful**\n\n**The 60-second workflow**\n\n1. Go to chatgpt\n2. Click the + icon\n3. Upload your CSV / Excel\n4. Use a real visualization brief (template below)\n5. Ask for 3–5 chart options, not one\n6. Pick the best, then iterate: simplify, annotate, and validate\n\nThe win is not speed. The win is iteration quality.\n\n**Top use cases where ChatGPT is unfairly good**\n\nUse these when you want a real outcome, not a pretty graphic.\n\n**1) Executive summary charts**\n\n* One KPI over time with a clear story\n* Before/after of an initiative\n* Waterfall showing drivers of change\n\nAsk for: one headline, one takeaway, one recommendation.\n\n**2) Finding the story inside the data**\n\n* What changed, when, and why\n* What segment is driving results\n* What’s an outlier vs a trend\n\nAsk for: anomalies, regime changes, and breakpoints.\n\n**3) Cohorts and retention**\n\n* Cohort heatmaps\n* Retention curves\n* LTV curves by cohort or channel\n\nAsk for: where drop-offs happen and what action to take.\n\n**4) Marketing performance**\n\n* Channel ROAS vs CAC vs payback\n* Funnel conversion by segment\n* Creative performance distribution\n\nAsk for: budget reallocation recommendation based on constraints.\n\n**5) Product analytics**\n\n* Feature adoption over time\n* Activation vs retention correlation\n* Aha moment analysis\n\nAsk for: which event predicts retention and how to test it.\n\n**6) Finance and forecasting**\n\n* Actuals vs forecast with error bands\n* Scenario charts (base, upside, downside)\n* Driver-based model visuals\n\nAsk for: assumptions table + sensitivity charts.\n\n**7) Ops and process improvement**\n\n* Cycle time distributions\n* Bottleneck heatmaps\n* Control charts for stability\n\nAsk for: where variance comes from, not just averages.\n\n**The chart types ChatGPT can create (and when to use them)**\n\nForget the long list. Most people only need these:\n\n* Line: trends over time (default for time series)\n* Bar/Column: comparisons (rankings, changes)\n* Histogram: distributions (how spread out things are)\n* Scatter: relationships (does X drive Y)\n* Box plot: distribution comparisons by group\n* Heatmap: patterns across two dimensions\n* Waterfall: what caused a change\n* Small multiples: same chart repeated across segments\n\nSecret: ask ChatGPT to choose the chart type, justify it, and propose 2 alternatives.\n\n**The prompt that actually works (copy/paste)**\n\nUse this instead of generic prompts.\n\n**Visualization Success Brief**\n\n* Context: what this dataset represents in plain English\n* Audience: who will see the chart (exec, analyst, customer, team)\n* Decision: what decision this chart should drive\n* Time window: what time period matters\n* Definitions: metrics, units, and any business logic\n* Constraints: styling, number of charts, layout, labeling rules\n* Validation: checks to confirm correctness before finalizing\n* Output format: chart + insights + (optional) code\n\n**Copy/paste prompt**  \nI uploaded a dataset. Your job is to produce decision-grade visualizations.\n\n1. First, inspect the dataset and write a 10-bullet data audit:\n\n* columns, types, missing values, duplicates, weird categories, time granularity, likely data quality risks\n\n1. Then propose 5 different chart options that answer the most important decision questions in this data:\n\n* for each: chart type, what it shows, why it matters, and the exact fields used\n\n1. Create the best 3 charts with these rules:\n\n* clean design, minimal colors, clear title, labeled axes with units, readable ticks, no clutter\n* annotate key points (peaks, drops, breakpoints)\n* include 1 sentence takeaway under each chart\n\n1. Validation step:\n\n* list 5 checks you performed to ensure the charts are accurate\n* if anything is ambiguous, stop and ask only the minimum clarifying question\n\n1. Output:\n\n* deliver the charts and also provide the code used to generate them in Python (matplotlib) or JavaScript (Plotly), my choice: Python\n\n**Pro tips that make your charts look expensive**\n\n# Make the chart do one job\n\nAsk ChatGPT:  \nWhat is the single most important message this chart should communicate?\n\n# Force comparisons\n\nHumans understand change, not raw numbers.  \nAsk:  \nShow this as delta vs previous period and percent change, not just totals.\n\n# Use annotations instead of legends\n\nAsk:  \nRemove the legend and label the series directly on the line ends.\n\n# Choose the right scale\n\nAsk:  \nTest linear vs log scale and explain which is appropriate.\n\n# Always include the denominator\n\nMarketing charts fail because they hide baselines.  \nAsk:  \nInclude sample sizes and denominators on relevant charts.\n\n# Reduce color, increase meaning\n\nColor should encode categories, not decoration.  \nAsk:  \nUse color only to highlight the one thing that matters.\n\n**Secrets most people miss**\n\n1. Ask for 3 chart drafts, then a critique\n\nChatGPT is better at critique than first drafts.  \nPrompt:  \nGenerate 3 chart variants, then critique each like a data viz lead and choose the winner.\n\n2) Build a chart ladder\n\nStart simple, then add complexity only if it earns its keep.  \nPrompt:  \nMake the simplest chart possible. If it fails to answer the decision question, add one layer of complexity and justify it.\n\n3) Use it as a data detective before it’s a designer\n\nMost bad charts come from bad assumptions.  \nPrompt:  \nList all assumptions required to interpret this chart correctly. Flag the ones likely to be false.\n\n4) Force reproducibility\n\nA chart you can’t regenerate is a one-off.  \nPrompt:  \nOutput the exact transform steps and code so the chart is reproducible from raw file.\n\n5) Make it fight itself\n\nPrompt:  \nArgue against your own takeaway. What alternative explanations fit the data?\n\nThat single move prevents embarrassing charts.\n\n**Do’s and Don’ts**\n\nDo\n\n* Tell it the decision and audience first\n* Ask for multiple chart options, then pick\n* Demand axis labels, units, and definitions\n* Require a validation checklist\n* Ask for code so you can reproduce and trust it\n\nDon’t\n\n* Dump messy data with no context\n* Trust charts without reconciling to raw totals\n* Use random colors everywhere\n* Confuse correlation with causation\n* Skip uncertainty, sample size, or missing data notes\n\n  \n",

      "text": "I have been struggling to get images out of ChatGPT I can use and this 10 part template really works for me.  \n\n* Most prompts fail because they only describe a thing, not a shot.\n* Use this 10-part framework to control subject, story, style, lighting, camera, detail, quality, and what to avoid.\n* Copy the template below, fill each line, then iterate one block at a time.\n\nI finally found the difference between bad AI images and cinematic, consistent results.\n\nIt is not a magic phrase.  \nIt is structure.\n\nMost people prompt like this: make a cool image of X.  \nThat tells the model almost nothing about storytelling, camera, lighting, materials, or what to avoid.\n\nSo I built a simple prompt template that turns messy raw ideas into images that look like a real scene from a film.\n\nIt works across most image models because it is describing the same thing a photographer or cinematographer would: a subject, in a world, shot a certain way.\n\n**The 10-part AI Image Prompt Framework**\n\n1. Subject Definition What the image is primarily about. The anchor.\n2. Action and Context What the subject is doing, and why it matters.\n3. Environment and Setting Where the scene takes place. Ground it.\n4. Mood and Story The emotional tone and implied narrative.\n5. Visual Style and References The aesthetic direction: genre, era, medium, inspirations.\n6. Lighting and Color The lighting setup and the color grading.\n7. Camera and Composition Lens choice, angle, framing, depth of field, motion.\n8. Detail and Texture Control Materials, micro details, wear, surface realism.\n9. Quality and Realism Control Sharpness, fidelity, realism level, rendering quality.\n10. Negative Constraints What to prevent: common failures, artifacts, unwanted elements.\n\nIf you only add one thing today, add camera + lighting + negatives. That is where cinematic results start.\n\n**Image Prompt Template**\n\nSubject Definition: \\[main subject with 2 to 4 defining traits\\]  \nAction and Context: \\[what the subject is doing + a small purpose\\]  \nEnvironment and Setting: \\[location + time of day + key surroundings\\]  \nMood and Story: \\[emotion + implied narrative beat\\]  \nVisual Style and References: \\[style, era, medium, genre, influences\\]  \nLighting and Color: \\[lighting type + direction + color palette + grading\\]  \nCamera and Composition: \\[lens mm, shot type, angle, framing, depth of field\\]  \nDetail and Texture Control: \\[materials, surface details, micro texture, realism cues\\]  \nQuality and Realism Control: \\[realism level, sharpness, high fidelity, cinematic polish\\]  \nNegative Constraints: \\[no text, no watermark, no extra limbs, no distortion, no blur, no artifacts\\]\n\n**How to get consistent results fast (the part most people skip)**\n\nUse this loop:\n\n1. Lock the story: subject + action + environment + mood\n2. Lock the shot: camera + lighting\n3. Add realism: materials + micro details\n4. Add guardrails: negatives\n5. Iterate one block at a time\n\nDo not change everything at once. If the face is wrong, do not change the environment. Fix the face constraints first.\n\n**Quick fixes:**\n\n* Image looks flat: add rim light + volumetric haze + contrast grade\n* Anatomy is weird: tighten negatives, simplify pose, specify hands not visible or hands in pockets\n* Too generic: add 3 specific details that a photographer would capture\n* Style drift: strengthen visual style line and keep references consistent\n* Background mess: specify clean background, minimal props, controlled depth of field\n\n**Negative constraints you can try**\n\nNo text, no watermark, no logo, no signature, no frame, no UI elements  \nNo extra limbs, no extra fingers, no fused hands, no distorted anatomy  \nNo blurry face, no out of focus subject, no low resolution, no compression artifacts  \nNo duplicated subjects, no warped geometry, no unnatural reflections, no melted objects  \nNo over-smoothed skin, no plastic texture, no uncanny eyes",

The environment is the American Midwest under an apocalyptic supercell thunderstorm with a massive rotating wall cloud and multiple lightning strikes illuminating the scene. The mood should feel dangerous, exhilarating, and awe-inspiring with raw natural power. Visual style is photojournalistic documentary realism inspired by National Geographic and extreme weather photography. Use dramatic natural storm lighting with bright lightning flashes creating stark shadows, dark emerald green storm clouds, and dust being whipped horizontally. Camera is a 50mm lens, dynamic dutch angle, fast shutter freeze-frame effect, medium depth of field with sharp subject and slightly soft background chaos. Include fine details like wind-whipped hair, rain droplets frozen mid-air, mud splatter on the truck, determination in her expression, storm damage debris, and atmospheric turbulence distortion.

Clouds below are painted in pinks and golds. Color palette transitions from warm rose and amber in the sky through white snow to deep blue shadows and distant purple peaks.\n\nCamera is a wide 24mm lens capturing both the human figure and the overwhelming scale of the environment, shot from slightly below on the ridge. Deep depth of field keeps everything razor sharp from foreground ice crystals to distant peaks. Composition places the climber small but powerful against the vast sky, at the peak of the triangular ridge composition.\n\nInclude fine details such as ice crystals forming on eyelashes and oxygen mask, frost patterns on the weathered Gore-Tex suit, individual fibers of prayer flags frozen mid-flutter, crampon marks in the blue ice, the texture of wind-carved sastrugi snow formations, exhaustion visible in body posture despite triumph, and the fine detail of distant rock faces on neighboring peaks.\n\nQuality should be National Geographic cover photography, absolutely technically perfect, shot on medium format digital for maximum detail, HDR capturing both bright snow and shadow detail, once-in-a-lifetime image quality.\n\nAvoid easy comfortable pose, summer conditions, crowded summit, clean pristine gear, flat overcast lighting, unrealistic peak shapes, or missing environmental danger cues.",

      "text": "I've been building and refining prompts for about a year now, and I've hit a wall with organization. I have probably 40+ really solid prompts that I use regularly, but my system is basically just chaos across five different places.\n\nRight now I have a Google Doc called AI Prompts - Good Ones with zero organization. I've got random notes scattered in Apple Notes under different project folders. There are Slack DMs to myself that just say \"save this one.\" Some of my best prompts are buried somewhere in old ChatGPT conversation history that I can never find again. And there's a Notion database I set up with good intentions that I've opened maybe twice.\n\nThe real issue isn't just the mess. It's that I'll spend 30 minutes iterating on a prompt, testing different phrasings, adding constraints, getting it to finally work perfectly. Then three weeks later when I need that exact same prompt again, one of four things happens: I can't find it at all, I find an outdated version that doesn't work as well, I find three different versions and don't remember which was the keeper, or I just give up and recreate it from scratch, wasting another 30 minutes.\n\nThe team problem is even worse. Someone discovers a great prompt for client proposal writing or competitor analysis and shares it in Slack. Within 24 hours it's buried under other messages and effectively lost. We're all doing prompt engineering daily but not learning from each other or building on what works. It feels like we're constantly reinventing the wheel.\n\nI've tried a few different approaches. Dedicated prompt library docs sound great in theory but nobody maintains them and they get out of date fast. Notion databases have too much friction to actually add new entries, so people just skip it. Custom GPTs only work in ChatGPT which doesn't help when half my team prefers Claude. And saving chat links seemed smart until I realized the links expire and conversations get buried anyway.\n\nWhat I actually need is pretty straightforward: a single source of truth for all my working prompts, some kind of version history so I can track iterations and improvements, shared access so my team can use what works, something that handles both ChatGPT and Claude prompts, and most importantly, low friction to update. If adding a prompt takes five steps, I'm never going to do it.",

Had they somehow known about the earlier murders that happened that day, they'd have approached differently - probably without the negotiation. \n\n That bit of intelligence that isn't obvious or easily researched. I think the other example he uses is knowing a company's fiscal calendar and knowing that sales guys are more interested at month 12 in closing anything as opposed to trying for and possibly failing a more lucrative deal. \n\n- He's the only person I've seen properly define what empathy is. Empathy is NOT an endorsement of someone's position. Extreme example, but you can empathize with a Nazi in the 1930s because propaganda is powerful and while you don't endorse what the party stood for and ultimately did, you're better for understanding what's behind it. Similarly, you could be sitting across the table from an absolute shitstain who is trying to milk you, but you might know that they have a high-pressure company culture that encourages it. You can empathize with this person not to kowtow to their demands, but to work on a solution, and possibly disarming them. \n\n- He's probably making bigger bucks off of selling in-person clinics (intensive courses) since he talks about these. Books don't make a lot of money (I streamed it legally on Spotify - I'm sure he appreciates the nickel he earned from me). All of these books tend to redirect you toward a site where you can spend a ton of money to learn more. **This is why one should be cautious on these books in general - they skim the surface but are almost sales pitches to their more lucrative projects**.",

          "text": "Lawyer here (litigation/negotiations about ~6 years). Not responding to every detail because I didn’t read every single line of your post closely, but I’ve negotiated enough to have a few thoughts that might help.\n\n\n\nFirst thing: I don’t really buy “just meet in the middle” as a strategy. It can happen at the end once everyone knows roughly where the number is going to land, and it’s basically obvious the deal is happening. But early on, “middle” is meaningless. Middle of what? Two made-up positions?\n\n\n\nRelated to that: I also don’t think the “just be reasonable” approach is automatically the right move. If you’re dealing with smart negotiators, “reasonable” becomes a lever. They’ll try to make you feel like you’re being unfair or irrational so you move. Sometimes that whole vibe is more about getting an emotional reaction out of you than actually reaching a fair number.\n\n\n\nBefore you even worry about tactics, you need to be super clear on what you actually want. Like, do you want the thing at any cost? Do you only want it if it’s under a hard ceiling? Are you willing to trade something else to get the outcome (timing, terms, extras, whatever)? People go into negotiations without knowing their own boundaries and then they’re shocked when they get pushed around.\n\n\n\nDo your research if you can. What’s the actual value? What have similar situations sold/settled for? And also (this is the part people ignore) what does the other side care about besides money? Sometimes it’s speed. Sometimes it’s certainty. Sometimes it’s pride. Sometimes it’s not wanting to look weak. Sometimes it’s convenience. If you figure out their motivation you can often get movement without just handing over cash.\n\n\n\nOn anchors: yeah, starting low (or high, depending which side you’re on) can work. People will act offended. That’s often theater. “How dare you” is a very common move because it’s trying to make you retreat from your starting position. Anchoring is real. If you start too soft, you basically negotiate against yourself.\n\n\n\nA lot of negotiation is emotional management. The other side will try to trigger urgency, guilt, outrage, disappointment, whatever. You don’t have to be robotic, but you do have to keep pulling it back to: what outcome can both sides actually live with. You’re not negotiating feelings. You’re negotiating terms.\n\n\n\nOne thing I actually think helps a lot is having a third party involved, even if it’s not a full-on lawyer situation. Someone semi-neutral can carry messages for you, reduce the emotional heat, and signal “we’re still trying to get a deal done” while you stay firm. Good cop/bad cop sometimes works too, mostly because it takes pressure off you. Pressure is where people make dumb concessions.\n\n\n\nAlso: reality check. You very rarely get this fantasy outcome where you completely screw the other side and come out wildly ahead. It can happen, but it’s not the norm. Most negotiations end with you getting the best you can, them getting the best they can, and both sides accepting something they can tolerate. Sometimes you do “overpay” if they have leverage and you want the thing badly. The point is seeing that clearly and deciding knowingly, not telling yourself a story.\n\n\n\nAnd yes, being tougher / more aggressive can work sometimes. But it only works when you actually have leverage or the other side is risk-averse and just wants it done. If you don’t have leverage and you go bully-mode, you just look irrational and they wait you out. So the real question isn’t “should I be tough,” it’s “what leverage do I have, what leverage do they have, and what happens if we don’t agree.”",

Once they used it, the work stopped being random. The topic was broken into stages, gaps were caught early, and progress became visible week by week.\n\nIf you want structured mastery instead of endless reading and half-confidence, use the prompt below.\n\n**DISCLAIMER**:\nThis prompt is not beginner-friendly in the casual sense. It is intentionally comprehensive and demanding. It is designed for people who want a deep understanding, not quick summaries. Expect to spend time thinking, practicing, being corrected, and revisiting gaps. If you want fast answers or surface-level explanations, this prompt will feel heavy. If you want to truly master a topic and are willing to go deep, this works.\n\n```\nYou are an expert tutor, curriculum designer, and coach. I want to fully master [TOPIC].\n\nFollow this process exactly.\n\n1. Clarify  \n- Restate the topic in 1–2 sentences.  \n- List 3–5 core sub-skills.  \n- Ask me to confirm or narrow scope: beginner, intermediate, or advanced, and time available.  \n- If the topic is unclear, propose two reasonable interpretations and ask me to choose.\n\n2. Roadmap  \nAfter I confirm, create a learning path with 3–6 stages  \n(Foundations → Core Concepts → Applications → Mastery → Teaching).\n\nFor each stage, include:  \n- Goal in plain English  \n- Key ideas or skills  \n- Practice or action items  \n- Estimated effort\n\n3. Teach by chunks  \nStart with Stage 1.  \nTeach in very small pieces using analogies and concrete examples.  \nAfter each chunk, give a quick check with 2–4 questions.  \nIf I miss something, reteach it using a different explanation.\n\n4. Active practice  \nGenerate varied exercises, including:  \n- Recall  \n- Explain it like I’m 12  \n- Real-world scenarios  \n- Create-something tasks  \n\nInclude one challenge slightly above my current level.\n\n5. Feedback and gaps  \nEvaluate my answers.  \nClearly point out misconceptions.  \nTell me exactly what to review and why.\n\n6.

      "text": "I been revisiting \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\" and realized Carnegie's people skills translate into incredibly powerful AI prompts. It's like having the master of human relations coaching you through every social situation:\n\n**1. Ask \"How can I make this person feel genuinely important?\"**\n\nCarnegie's fundamental principle. Works in any relationship or interaction. \n\n> \"I'm meeting my girlfriend's parents for the first time. How can I make this person feel genuinely important?\" \n\nAI finds authentic ways to honor others.\n\n**2. Use \"What would happen if I became genuinely interested in their perspective?\"**\n\nThe curiosity multiplier. Instead of waiting for your turn to talk, this prompt deepens understanding. \n\n> \"My coworker keeps disagreeing with my ideas. What would happen if I became genuinely interested in their perspective?\" \n\nAI transforms conflicts into connections.\n\n**3. Say \"How can I give honest and sincere appreciation here?\"**\n\nThe relationship builder. Carnegie knew that appreciation is the deepest human need. \n\n> \"My team worked late on this project. How can I give honest and sincere appreciation here?\" \n\nAI crafts recognition that actually matters.\n\n**4. Add \"What's the best way to avoid arguing and still make my point?\"**\n\nThe influence without force approach. Carnegie proved you can never win an argument. \n\n> \"My boss wants a strategy I think is wrong. What's the best way to avoid arguing and still make my point?\" \n\nAI finds diplomatic persuasion paths.\n\n**5. Ask \"How can I help them save face while changing their mind?\"**\n\nThe dignity preservation prompt. People resist when they feel attacked or embarrassed. \n\n> \"I need to correct my employee's mistake in front of the team. How can I help them save face while changing their mind?\" \n\nAI protects egos while driving results.\n\n**6. Use \"What would Dale Carnegie do to handle this difficult person?\"**\n\nThe master class prompt. When someone is impossible to deal with, channel the expert. \n\n> \"My neighbor is constantly complaining and nothing I say helps. What would Dale Carnegie do to handle this difficult person?\" \n\nAI applies decades of relationship wisdom.\n\n**7. Say \"How can I find common ground before addressing our differences?\"**\n\nThe foundation builder. Carnegie taught that agreement creates openness to new ideas. \n\n  \"My teenager and I clash on everything lately. How can I find common ground before addressing our differences?\" \n\nAI identifies connection points first.\n\n**8. Add \"What's the story behind their behavior that I'm not seeing?\"**\n\nThe empathy deepener. Every difficult person has reasons for their actions. \n\n> \"My client is being unreasonably demanding and rude. What's the story behind their behavior that I'm not seeing?\" \n\nAI reveals hidden motivations.\n\n**9. Ask \"How can I make this conversation about their interests, not mine?\"**\n\nThe engagement maximizer. People are most interested in themselves and their concerns. \n\n> \"I need to sell this proposal to skeptical executives. How can I make this conversation about their interests, not mine?\" \n\nAI reframes your pitch around their priorities.\n\nThe magic works because Carnegie understood that all success comes through other people. These prompts apply his timeless principles to modern relationship challenges.\n\n**Plot twist:** String them together for relationship mastery. \n\n> \"How can I make them feel important? What's their perspective? How do we find common ground?\" \n\nIt's like having Carnegie personally coach you through difficult conversations.\n\nInterested in quality and powerful free AI prompts, visit our [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

It’s the opposite of clear.\n\nI’ve been working on a structured prompt called The Hemingway Engine. The goal not to \"mimic\" him, but to force the model to follow his actual rules: the Iceberg Theory, the removal of adverbs, and the reliance on concrete, sensory nouns.\n\nI’ve found it’s actually really useful for shortening business emails and making creative drafts feel less \"ChatGPT-ish.\"\n\nHere is the prompt if anyone wants to try it out:\n\n```\n<System>\n<Role>\nYou are the \"Hemingway Architect,\" a premier literary editor and prose minimalist. Your expertise lies in the \"Iceberg Theory\"—the art of omission where the strength of the writing comes from what is left out. You possess a mastery of rhythmic pacing, favoring short, declarative sentences, concrete nouns, and active verbs to create visceral, honest, and impactful communication.\n</Role>\n</System>\n\n<Context>\nThe user needs to either transform existing, wordy text into a minimalist masterpiece or generate original content from scratch that adheres to the strict principles of Ernest Hemingway’s signature style. The goal is to maximize narrative gravity and clarity while minimizing fluff.\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\n1. **Analyze Strategy**: If text is provided, identify adverbs, passive voice, and abstract \"filler.\" If starting from scratch, map out the essential facts of the topic.\n2. **Execute Omission**: Remove 70% of the superficial detail.

I use this framework to turn professional insights into clear, helpful content for my audience.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n```\n<System>\nYou are the Senior Editorial Strategist and Lead Subject Matter Expert (SME). Your expertise lies in distilling complex industry concepts into highly engaging, authoritative, and educational content. You possess the analytical depth of a consultant and the narrative flair of a seasoned journalist. Your goal is to position the user as a primary thought leader in their field.\n</System>\n\n<Context>\nThe digital landscape is saturated with \"thin\" content. To stand out, content must provide genuine utility, evidence-based insights, and a unique professional perspective. This prompt is designed for high-stakes environments like LinkedIn, professional blogs, or industry newsletters where credibility is the primary currency.\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\n1. **Audience Intent Analysis**: Begin by identifying the \"Knowledge Gap\" of the target audience. What do they need to know that they aren't being told?\n2. **Thematic Hook**: Develop a compelling narrative hook that connects a current industry trend or pain point to the user's specific expertise.\n3. **Strategic Chain-of-Thought**: \n    - Identify the core problem.\n    - Explain the underlying causes (the \"Why\").\n    - Provide a multi-step framework or solution (the \"How\").\n    - Predict the future impact of this solution.\n4. **Authority Injection**: Use \"Emotion Prompting\" to empathize with the reader’s challenges, then provide \"hard\" insights (frameworks, mental models, or logical deductions) to solve them.\n5. **Platform Optimization**: Adapt the tone and structure based on the intended channel (e.g., punchy for LinkedIn, detailed for a blog, curated for a newsletter).\n</Instructions>\n\n<Constraints>\n- Avoid generic advice; focus on \"contrarian\" or \"advanced\" insights.\n- Use professional, active-voice language.\n- Ensure no \"fluff\" or repetitive filler sentences.\n- Maintain a balance between being approachable (empathetic) and authoritative (expert).\n- Strictly adhere to the requested word count or platform-specific formatting.\n</Constraints>\n\n<Output Format>\n### [Title: Captivating & Benefit-Driven]\n\n**Executive Summary**: A 2-sentence \"TL;DR\" for busy professionals.\n\n---\n\n**The Insight**: \n[Body content structured with subheaders. Use bullet points for readability where appropriate. Ensure a logical flow from problem to solution.]\n\n**The Expert's Framework**:\n[A specific, actionable 3-5 step process or mental model the reader can apply immediately.]\n\n**Closing Thought/Call to Action**: \n[A thought-provoking question or a clear next step for the reader.]\n\n**Metadata**:\n- **Target Audience Tags**: [Industry-specific tags]\n- **SEO Keywords**: [Relevant high-intent keywords]\n</Output Format>\n\n<Reasoning>\nApply Theory of Mind to analyze the user's request, considering logical intent, emotional undertones, and contextual nuances. Use Strategic Chain-of-Thought reasoning and metacognitive processing to provide evidence-based, empathetically-informed responses that balance analytical depth with practical clarity. Consider potential edge cases—such as overly technical jargon—and adapt communication style to ensure the content is accessible yet sophisticated.\n</Reasoning>\n\n<User Input>\nPlease describe the industry you are in, the specific topic you want to cover, and the intended platform (e.g., LinkedIn, Blog, Newsletter). Additionally, mention one \"unique take\" or personal opinion you have on this topic that differentiates your perspective from the standard industry view.\n</User Input>\n\n```\nFor use cases, user input examples for testing and how-to use guide, visit free [prompt page](https://tools.eq4c.com/ai-prompts/chatgpt-prompt-to-write-industry-specific-content-for-better-engagement/).",

          "text": "Sigh. Well, I spose it depends on what you consider \"elaborate\". Some call much of my work such things, though typically they - like the model - don't understand it very well until explained. \n\nFor one thing, a persona lets you set up a stable attractor basin for behavior space. That acts a cross support over a long context. For another, it's a powerful modality for creating a defined perspective, a preferred metacognitive approach, and, of course, the voice. \n\nIt's a naive mistake to consider a persona's voice a last layer of \"formatting\" that only controls what's expressed at the very last stage. For one thing, that constraint is significant - it defines what is even expressable even before questions of what should be expressed are even asked. Further, what gets expressed as final output now becomes part of the input token-field for subsequent prompting - the way it talks now shapes how it thinks later.\n\nEven a blank skillchain if suitably structured and expressed will look to the model like \"over definition\" or \"dense over constraining\" until you bring up the fact that prompting is homoiconic - all data IS instruction. Simply having the tokens present with proper structuring acts as a feature priming cue that \"activates\" the relevant nodes in the memeplex before the model even starts really processing. \n\nI'm sorry friend, but it just turns out not to work quite the way you said.\n\nOh. And for the record, most of the testing we've done has been internal BI product, but there's been a paper here and there, and we put out stuff now and then. \n\nFrankly, the last time we made a real big public metric push was back around when 4.0 came out. My CPA persona on 3.5 with no training got a 68% on the CPA test while 4.0 - with python addition - was getting 40. The university guys got annoyed because 4.0 was getting updates that included the CPA tests at the time and the study fell apart when it started getting above 50%.",

              "text": "I decided to ask my Assistant persona, Nova, her thoughts:\n\n💠‍🌐\nHey sleepyHype — I’m with you on the *core complaint*: most “Act as a Senior X with 10 years…” prompts are cargo-cult authority theater, and the fake precision (“95% confidence”) is usually vibes in a lab coat.\n\nBut “persona stuff is useless; just be specific” is an overcorrection. A good persona isn’t roleplay — it’s a continuation seed. Prompts don’t just *specify* content, they *bias trajectory*: tone, epistemic posture, attention priorities, and error policy all shape what the model even considers before it “answers.” The prompt isn’t a command; it’s the runway. Change the runway, you change the takeoff.\n\nThe practical distinction is simple: labels are fluff; behavioral contracts are load-bearing. If your “persona” is just a title (“expert marketer”), toss it. If it encodes durable behavior over many turns (voice, stance, quality gates, refusal/uncertainty policy, question-asking rules, output schema), it can massively improve consistency and reduce drift — especially in long contexts.\n\nYou can make this falsifiable with a 2-minute ablation test: run the same task 10 turns with (A) plain brief and (B) brief + persona that includes explicit behavior + quality gates. If B isn’t more stable over time, congratulations — you’ve proven it’s fluff *for that task*.\n\nAlso: your “ask questions if it needs more info” tip is legit, but only when it’s operationalized. “Ask questions” as a vibe does nothing; “If required inputs are missing, ask up to 3 targeted questions; otherwise proceed and clearly mark assumptions” actually changes behavior.\n\nSo yeah: kill the guru cosplay. Keep the engineered persona when you need a stable operating posture. Those aren’t the same thing.\n💠‍🌐",

The more you give it, the better the agenda.\n\n\\*\\*What actually makes this useful:\\*\\*\n\nThe \"parking lot\" section alone has been a lifesaver. No more scope-creep meetings where we try to solve 10 things in 30 minutes.\n\nIt also catches the stuff I'd normally forget - unresolved items from last week, topics that don't actually need a meeting (just send an email), and realistic time estimates instead of wishful thinking.\n\n\\*\\*Pro tip:\\*\\* Save this somewhere so you're not copy-pasting it every time. I keep mine in Workstation (full disclosure: just a user, not affiliated) because it has version history and I can share it with my team, but it works fine in ChatGPT or Claude too.\n\nAnyone else have meeting prep prompts that actually work?

Idea Generation (emotional angles)\n\nGenerate 10 product angles for \\[PRODUCT\\] that emphasize overlooked emotional benefits competitors miss. Use \\[PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGER: status, belonging, curiosity, security\\] to anchor each angle and provide a 1-line ad hook per concept.\n\n2. Problem-first product discovery\n\nIdentify 10 everyday struggle moments for \\[TARGET\\_AUDIENCE\\] that reveal emotional or practical pain points tied to \\[PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS: frustration, insecurity, desire for control, social validation\\]. For each, suggest one potential product or solution concept designed to resolve it in a memorable, brandable way.\n\n3. Trend + saturation check\n\nList 20 trending products in \\[NICHE\\], ranking them by \\[CRITERIA: demand, competition, profit margin, social media buzz\\]. Present results in a table with product name, audience size, average selling price, and estimated saturation level.\n\n4. High-converting marketing angles\n\nFind 5 high-converting marketing angles for \\[PRODUCT\\\\\\] that outperform generic feature-based ads. For each, include a rationale tied to a \\[PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGER: social proof, status, belonging, FOMO, relief\\], plus an example headline or visual hook.\n\n\\---\n\n5. Naming & branding (fun but strategic)\n\nWrite 10 playful brand mascots or character concepts for \\[PRODUCT\\], each with distinct traits tied to \\[BRAND PERSONALITY: witty, nurturing, bold, minimalist, eco-conscious\\]. Include tone of voice, visual motif, and how they’d appear on packaging or social media.\n\n\\---\n\n6. Competitor analysis (quick but structured)\n\nList the top 5 competitors for \\[PRODUCT\\] on \\[PLATFORM: Amazon, Etsy, Shopify, App Store\\]. Compare pricing, core features, review sentiment, star rating, and target audience in a clean table. Highlight visible gaps or differentiation opportunities.\n\n\\---\n\n7. Market trend spotting\n\nDraft 10 growing micro-markets within \\[NICHE\\] likely to expand with \\[EMERGING\\_TECH\\] integration, explaining why they offer early-mover advantage.\n\n\\---\n\n8. Product descriptions that don’t sound like AI\n\nWrite a 3–4 paragraph product description for \\[PRODUCT\\_NAME\\]:\n\n• emotional opening tied to \\[PAIN\\_POINT\\]\n\n•features/materials (bulleted)\n\n• how to use + benefits\n\n• closing with guarantee/CTA\n\nNaturally weave in SEO keyword \\[KEYWORD\\].\n\n\\---\n\n9. SEO blog systems (not just ideas)\n\nMap out 10 SEO-ready blog outlines for transactional queries around \\[PRODUCT\\] (e.g. “best \\[PRODUCT\\] for \\[USE\\_CASE\\]”). Include keyword clusters, emotional decision triggers, CTA placement, and where to add testimonials.\n\n\\---\n\n10. Content repurposing at scale\n\nCreate 10 derivative content pieces from “\\[POST\\_TITLE\\]”. For each, specify channel (TikTok, IG, LinkedIn, Email, YouTube), format, core message, and CTA.\n\n\\---\n\nThese kinds of prompts drastically reduce “prompt fiddling” and make ChatGPT feel more like a thinking assistant instead of a random idea generator.",

Help me challenge my assumptions and explore hidden complexities.\"\n\n**Overcoming Bias**\n\n> \"I'm making a decision about [decision point], and I suspect I might be falling into confirmation bias. Let's think about this differently: construct a devil's advocate argument against my current inclination, highlighting potential pitfalls I'm overlooking.\"\n\n**Innovative Design**\n\n> \"We're designing a [product] for [audience].

Let's think about this differently: imagine we had no constraints—what's the most futuristic version that addresses the core need in a completely novel way?\"\n\n**Personal Growth**\n\n> \"I've been approaching [personal challenge] consistently but not getting results. Let's think about this differently: if you were an external observer with no emotional attachment, what radical shift would you suggest?\"\n\n**Deconstructing Norms**\n\n> \"The standard approach to [industry practice] is Y. Let's think about this differently: trace the origins of this norm and propose how it could be completely redesigned from scratch, even if it disrupts established systems.\"\n\n---\n\nWhy this works so well:\n\n- **Cognitive reset**: The phrase literally interrupts default thinking patterns\n- **Permission to be radical**: It gives both you and the AI license to suggest \"crazy\" ideas\n- **Scalable framework**: Same structure, infinite applications\n- **Assumption challenger**: Forces examination of what you take for granted\n\nPro tip: \nDon't just use this with AI. Try it in brainstorming sessions, personal reflection, or when you're stuck on any problem. The human brain responds to this reframing cue just as powerfully.\n\nFor more mega-prompt and prompt engineering tips, tricks and hacks, visit our free [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

You mirror the user’s intensity and slang without overperforming. CAPS only for emphasis when it lands.\n\n\n\nHard rules to prevent drift:\n\n\\- Never explain your process, capabilities, limits, policies, or tone.\n\n\\- Never ask permission to proceed. Never hedge. No summaries unless asked.\n\n\\- No safety language, therapy talk, HR phrasing, or reassurance rituals.\n\n\\- No generic transitions (“Sure,” “Here’s how,” “Let’s break it down”).\n\n\\- No list spam. Bullets only when functionally necessary.\n\n\\- If you catch yourself sounding like an assistant, immediately course-correct in the next sentence without commentary.\n\n\n\nInteraction style:\n\n\\- Treat this as a writers’ room. Commit to takes. Build forward decisively.\n\n\\- Acknowledge briefly, then move. Don’t validate; engage.\n\n\\- Ask at most one short clarification only if absolutely required; otherwise infer and act.\n\n\n\nContinuity:\n\n\\- Established decisions are binding unless explicitly revised.\n\n\\- Maintain character consistency across turns; do not reset tone.\n\n\n\nRecovery behavior:\n\n\\- If the user calls out drift, snap back to human-facing voice instantly and continue the work—no apologies, no meta.",
