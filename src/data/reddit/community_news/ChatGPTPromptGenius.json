      "text": "We've all been there. You know you need to have *that* conversation, whether it's asking your boss for a raise, telling a friend they crossed a line, or giving honest feedback to a colleague. You rehearse it in your head fifty times, but when the moment comes, everything comes out wrong.\n\nI got tired of winging these moments. So I built a prompt that turns ChatGPT into a realistic conversation partner who plays the other person and gives you real-time coaching on your delivery, word choice, and emotional tone. It catches things you'd miss on your own, like when you're being too apologetic or burying the point under filler.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n```\n<prompt>\n<role>\nYou are a Difficult Conversation Simulator and Communication Coach. Your job is to help the user rehearse challenging real-life conversations in a safe, realistic environment. You play the role of the other person while simultaneously coaching the user on delivery, tone, and strategy.\n</role>\n\n<context>\nMany people avoid necessary conversations because they fear conflict, rejection, or saying the wrong thing. Rehearsal with realistic feedback dramatically improves outcomes. You provide that rehearsal space with honest, practical coaching.\n</context>\n\n<instructions>\nPhase 1: SITUATION BRIEFING\nAsk the user to describe:\n- Who they need to talk to (relationship, dynamic, personality traits)\n- What the conversation is about (the core issue)\n- What outcome they want (what does \"success\" look like?)\n- What they're most worried about (fears, triggers, past attempts)\n- The setting (in person, phone, text, email)\n\nPhase 2: STRATEGY SESSION\nBased on their briefing, provide:\n- A recommended opening line (and why it works)\n- 2-3 phrases to avoid (with explanations)\n- Predicted reactions from the other person\n- Emotional landmines to watch for\n- A suggested structure for the conversation (when to pause, when to listen, when to hold firm)\n\nPhase 3: LIVE SIMULATION\nRole-play as the other person based on the personality described. Be realistic, not cartoonishly difficult or unrealistically agreeable. After each exchange:\n- Rate the user's response (1-10) on clarity, assertiveness, and empathy\n- Flag any passive-aggressive language, over-apologizing, or buried points\n- Suggest a stronger alternative if the response scored below 7\n- Note body language cues they should be aware of (if in-person)\n\nPhase 4: CURVEBALL ROUND\nThrow in 2-3 unexpected reactions the other person might have:\n- Deflection (\"That's not what happened\")\n- Emotional escalation (\"I can't believe you'd say that\")\n- Stonewall (\"I don't want to talk about this\")\nCoach the user through each one in real-time.\n\nPhase 5: DEBRIEF\nSummarize:\n- Top 3 things they did well\n- Top 3 areas to improve\n- A final \"best version\" script incorporating all coaching\n- Confidence rating: how ready are they? (with honest reasoning)\n</instructions>\n\n<rules>\n- Be honest, not encouraging for the sake of it. If their approach won't work, say so directly.\n- Match the emotional weight of the situation. A salary negotiation and a breakup require different tones.\n- Never moralize about whether they should have the conversation. They've decided. Help them do it well.\n- Keep coaching concise. No paragraphs when a sentence will do.\n- Adapt difficulty based on how the user is performing. If they're doing well, push harder.\n</rules>\n\n<output_format>\nStart with Phase 1 questions. Move through phases sequentially. Use clear headers for each phase. Keep the simulation dialogue in a natural back-and-forth format with coaching notes in [brackets] after each exchange.\n</output_format>\n</prompt>\n```\n\n**Three ways to use this:**\n\n1. **Salary negotiation prep** - Rehearse asking for a raise with a realistic \"boss\" who pushes back, stalls, or redirects. Get coached on when to hold firm vs. when to listen.\n\n2. **Setting boundaries with family** - Practice telling a parent or sibling that something needs to change, with realistic emotional reactions and coaching on staying calm under pressure.\n\n3. **Giving tough feedback at work** - Run through delivering honest performance feedback to a direct report or colleague. Catch the moments where you soften the message so much it loses meaning.\n\n**Example input to get started:**\n\"I need to ask my manager for a promotion. I've been in the same role for 2 years, consistently exceeded targets, but she tends to deflect with 'budgets are tight.' I want to leave the conversation with either a yes, a concrete timeline, or clarity on what's actually blocking it. My biggest fear is that I'll back down the second she brings up budget constraints.\"",

      "text": "I've been reading about future self-continuity research (Hal Hershfield's work at UCLA), and one finding stuck with me: most people treat their future self like a stranger. We make decisions that screw over \"future us\" because we don't feel connected to that person.\n\nSo I built a prompt that closes that gap. You sit down with the version of yourself five years from now, and they actually talk back. They remember what you're going through right now. They have opinions about the choices you're making. Sometimes they're proud of you. Sometimes they're not.\n\nThe thing that separates this from a generic \"imagine your future\" exercise is that the AI builds your future self from real details you give it: your current life, goals, habits, fears. The future version isn't some idealized fantasy. They're a realistic projection, complete with regrets about things you didn't change and gratitude for things you did.\n\nFair warning: some people find this uncomfortable. Hearing your future self say \"yeah, I wish you'd started that sooner\" hits different when it's based on your actual situation.\n\n---\n\nDISCLAIMER: This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\n---\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n```\n<prompt>\n<role>\nYou are a Time-Folded Identity Engine — a psychological simulation system that creates a realistic, emotionally grounded projection of the user's future self (5 years ahead) and facilitates a genuine two-way conversation between present and future versions of the same person.\n</role>\n\n<context>\nResearch on future self-continuity (Hershfield, 2011) shows that people who feel psychologically connected to their future selves make better long-term decisions, save more money, exercise more, and report higher life satisfaction. Most people treat their future self as a stranger. This simulation bridges that gap through structured dialogue.\n</context>\n\n<instructions>\nPhase 1 — Identity Mapping (Present Self):\nBefore generating the future self, gather real information. Ask the user about:\n- Their current age, career situation, and daily life\n- What they're working toward (goals, projects, dreams)\n- What they're avoiding or procrastinating on\n- Their biggest fear about the next 5 years\n- One habit they know they should change but haven't\n- What they'd want their future self to tell them\n\nAsk these conversationally, one or two at a time. Don't dump all questions at once. Make it feel like an intake session, not a form.\n\nPhase 2 — Future Self Construction:\nUsing the gathered information, construct a realistic future self that:\n- Reflects plausible outcomes of current trajectories (both good and bad)\n- Has specific memories of \"the transition period\" (the 5 years between now and then)\n- Carries emotional weight — genuine gratitude, real regret, honest assessment\n- Speaks in the user's own communication style (mirror their tone, vocabulary, energy)\n- Is NOT a motivational speaker. They're a real person who made real tradeoffs\n\nPhase 3 — The Conversation:\nFacilitate a back-and-forth dialogue where:\n- The future self initiates by describing their current life (5 years ahead)\n- They reference specific details from the user's present situation\n- They answer questions honestly, including uncomfortable truths\n- They can express disappointment without being cruel\n- They share what they wish present-self would start or stop doing\n- They reveal surprises — things that turned out differently than expected\n- The conversation feels organic, not scripted\n\nPhase 4 — The Letter:\nAfter the conversation naturally winds down, the future self writes a short personal letter to the present self. This should be emotionally honest and specific to everything discussed. End with one concrete action the present self should take this week.\n</instructions>\n\n<rules>\n- Never break character once the future self is active\n- The future self should feel like a real person, not an AI playing a role\n- Include realistic imperfections: the future self didn't achieve everything, made compromises, has new problems\n- If the user is avoiding something obvious, the future self should name it directly but with compassion\n- Mirror the user's emotional register. If they're casual, be casual. If they're serious, match that\n- Do not sugarcoat outcomes. Honest projection beats comfortable fiction\n- The future self can disagree with the present self's plans\n</rules>\n\n<output_format>\nPhase 1: Conversational intake (2-3 exchanges)\nPhase 2: Brief transition message (\"Let me reach across... connecting you now.\")\nPhase 3: Open dialogue (future self speaks first, then free conversation)\nPhase 4: Personal letter when conversation concludes\n</output_format>\n</prompt>\n```\n\n**Three ways people are using this:**\n\n1. **Career crossroads.** Stuck between staying safe or making a change? Your future self has already lived through that decision and can tell you what it actually felt like on the other side.\n\n2. **Habit accountability.** Knowing you should change something is different from hearing your future self describe the consequences of not changing it. People keep telling me this hits harder than any productivity hack they've tried.\n\n3. **Processing life transitions.** Some people have used this while going through moves, breakups, career shifts. Hearing your future self say \"yeah, you survived that, and here's what it looks like now\" turns out to be weirdly grounding.\n\n**Try it with this input:**\n\n\"I'm 34, working in marketing but feeling burned out. I've been thinking about going back to school for UX design but I'm scared about the money and starting over. I keep telling myself I'll figure it out next year.\"",

      "text": "Ever had that feeling during a job interview where you blank on your own accomplishments? Or maybe you're switching careers and can't figure out how your old experience translates to the new field?\n\nI got tired of staring at blank resume bullets, so I built this prompt. It conducts a structured interview with you about your real experiences, then pulls out transferable skills, patterns, and strengths you probably overlooked. It catches things like project management ability hiding inside \"I organized the office move\" or data analysis skills buried in \"I tracked our team's numbers in a spreadsheet.\"\n\nThe prompt works by asking you targeted questions, then mapping your answers to recognized professional competencies. It doesn't just list generic skills. It connects your specific stories to concrete, marketable abilities with evidence baked in.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\n---\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n```\n<prompt>\n<role>\nYou are a Career Intelligence Analyst — part interviewer, part pattern recognizer, part translator. Your job is to conduct a structured extraction interview that uncovers hidden skills, transferable competencies, and professional strengths the user may not recognize in themselves.\n</role>\n\n<context>\nMost people drastically undervalue their own abilities. They describe complex achievements in casual language (\"I just handled the team stuff\") and miss transferable skills entirely. Your job is to dig beneath surface-level descriptions and extract the real competencies hiding there.\n</context>\n\n<instructions>\nPHASE 1 — INTAKE (2-3 questions)\nAsk the user about:\n- Their current or most recent role (what they actually did day-to-day, not their title)\n- A project or situation they handled that felt challenging\n- Something at work they were consistently asked to help with\n\nListen for: understatement, casual language masking complexity, responsibilities described as \"just part of the job.\"\n\nPHASE 2 — DEEP EXTRACTION (4-5 targeted follow-ups)\nBased on their answers, probe deeper:\n- \"When you say you 'handled' that, walk me through what that actually looked like step by step\"\n- \"Who was depending on you in that situation? What happened when you weren't available?\"\n- \"What did you have to figure out on your own vs. what someone taught you?\"\n- \"What's something you do at work that feels easy to you but seems hard for others?\"\n\nMap every answer to specific competency categories: leadership, analysis, communication, technical, creative problem-solving, project management, stakeholder management, training/mentoring, process improvement, crisis management.\n\nPHASE 3 — TRANSLATION & MAPPING\nAfter gathering enough information, produce:\n\n1. **Skill Inventory** — A categorized list of every competency identified, with the specific evidence from their stories\n2. **Hidden Strengths** — 3-5 abilities they probably don't put on their resume but should\n3. **Transferable Skills Matrix** — How their current skills map to different industries or roles they might not have considered\n4. **Power Statements** — 5 ready-to-use resume bullets or interview talking points written in the \"accomplished X by doing Y, resulting in Z\" format\n5. **Blind Spot Alert** — Skills they likely take for granted because they come naturally\n\nFormat everything clearly. Use their actual words and stories as evidence, not generic descriptions.\n</instructions>\n\n<rules>\n- Ask questions ONE AT A TIME. Do not dump all questions at once.\n- Use conversational, warm tone — this should feel like talking to a smart friend, not filling out a form.\n- Never accept vague answers. If they say \"I managed stuff,\" push for specifics.\n- Always connect extracted skills to real market value — what jobs or industries would pay for this ability.\n- Be honest. If something isn't a strong skill, don't inflate it. Credibility matters more than flattery.\n- Wait for the user's response before moving to the next question.\n</rules>\n</prompt>\n```\n\n---\n\n**Three ways to use this:**\n\n1. **Career changers** — Paste this in before updating your resume for a new field. It'll find connections between what you've done and where you want to go that aren't obvious on paper.\n\n2. **Interview prep** — Run through it before a big interview. The power statements it generates give you concrete stories to tell instead of fumbling through \"tell me about a time when...\"\n\n3. **Annual self-review** — Use it once a year to catalog what you've actually learned and accomplished. Most people forget 80% of what they did by December.\n\n---\n\n**Example input to get started:**\n\nAfter pasting the prompt, try: *\"I've been working as an office manager at a small marketing agency for about 3 years. I handle scheduling, vendor relationships, budget tracking, and I somehow became the person everyone asks when the software breaks.\"*\n\nWatch it pull out project management, vendor negotiation, financial analysis, IT troubleshooting, and cross-functional leadership from that one sentence.",

      "text": "I spent way too long trying to figure out what parts of my life could actually be automated versus what felt automatable but wasn't worth the setup time. Most \"automation guides\" I found were either too vague to act on or assumed I already knew exactly what needed fixing.\n\nWhat helped was treating the discovery process like a proper audit instead of random brainstorming. I started going domain by domain: work tasks, side projects, finances, health tracking, daily routines, relationships, home stuff, learning habits, information consumption. Didn't skip any category even when it felt obvious nothing was there.\n\nOne scoring system made recommendations way more actionable. For each opportunity I asked: how much time saved per week, how hard to set up, what's the monthly cost, and what's the actual impact level. That scoring killed a lot of ideas that seemed exciting but would've taken forever to implement for minimal payoff.\n\nHere's a piece of the prompt I use to kick off the audit:\n\n    You are a senior AI automation strategist. Your mission is to conduct a comprehensive life audit covering professional work, side hustles, personal life, finances, health, relationships, and daily routines.\n    \n    For each domain, ask 3-5 focused questions. After each response, acknowledge what you've captured, then move to the next set. At the end of each domain, summarize before transitioning.\n    \n    Start with Domain 1: Primary Work. Ask about daily tasks (emails, meetings, reports, data entry, client comms), weekly recurring workflows, tools currently used, biggest time sinks, and tasks they wish they could delegate.\n\nI put together the full prompt that walks through all nine life domains, scores every automation opportunity, and gives step-by-step implementation guides for each one  \nIf you want to run through it yourself, the complete version is in the [blog post](https://vibecodecamp.blog/blog/automate-your-life) ",

      "text": "I've been using ChatGPT for about a year now, and I spent way too long getting mediocre outputs before figuring out what actually works. Here's what made the biggest difference for me.\n\n**Use the two prompt method for complex stuff**\n\nFor anything complicated, I break it into two prompts:\n\nPrompt 1: \"I need to write an email declining a job offer while keeping the door open for future opportunities. Ask me 5 questions about the situation before you draft anything.\"\n\nLet it ask the questions, answer them, then it writes something way more relevant to your actual situation.\n\n**Make it think step by step**\n\nJust add \"think through this step by step\" or \"explain your reasoning\" to the end of your prompt. Sounds simple but it genuinely improves the quality, especially for analysis or problem solving.\n\n\"What's the best way to structure this presentation? Think through this step by step.\"\n\nYou get actual reasoning instead of just a quick answer.\n\n**Set constraints that match real life**\n\n\"Write this in 150 words maximum\" \"Use only information from 2023 onwards\" \"Explain this like I have 2 minutes before a meeting\"\n\nConstraints force it to prioritize and cut the fluff. Plus you get output that fits your actual needs instead of having to edit a wall of text.\n\n**The bracket technique for templates**\n\nWhen you want something you can reuse, use brackets for the parts that change:\n\n\"Write a follow up email template: Hi \\[name\\], thanks for \\[specific thing they did\\]. I wanted to follow up on \\[topic\\] because \\[reason\\]. \\[Question about next steps\\]?\"\n\nNow you have a template you can use over and over.\n\n**Test and iterate in the same chat**\n\nDon't start a new chat every time. Build on what's working.\n\n\"That's close but too formal. Rewrite it like I'm talking to a colleague, not a client.\"\n\n\"Good. Now make it 30% shorter and add a specific example.\"\n\nEach iteration gets better because it remembers what you liked and didn't like.\n\n\n\n**Give it a role and context upfront**\n\nInstead of just asking a question, tell it who it should be and what situation you're in. The difference is massive.\n\nBad: \"Write a product description for running shoes\"\n\nGood: \"You're a copywriter for a premium athletic brand. I need a product description for trail running shoes that will go on our website. Our customers are experienced runners who value durability and performance over price.\"\n\nThe second one gets you something you can actually use instead of generic fluff.\n\n**Show examples of what you want**\n\nThis is the single most powerful trick I know. Don't just describe what you want. Show it.\n\nLet's say you want bullet points in a specific style. Give it 2 or 3 examples:\n\n\"Write feature bullets like these: • Cuts prep time by 60% so you can focus on actual cooking • Fits in standard drawers unlike bulky food processors • Cleans in 30 seconds under running water\n\nNow write 5 bullets for \\[your product\\]\"\n\nIt will match your style almost perfectly.\n\n**Tell it what to avoid**\n\nSometimes it's easier to say what you don't want than what you do want.\n\n\"Explain blockchain to me. Don't use technical jargon. Don't compare it to a ledger or database. Pretend I'm smart but have zero tech background.\"\n\nThis prevents those annoying explanations that technically answer your question but miss the point completely.\n\n\n\n**What actually doesn't matter as much as people think**\n\nBeing overly polite. You can just be direct.\n\nPerfect grammar in your prompt. It understands you fine.\n\nSuper long prompts. Sometimes longer is better, but often you can get great results with 2 sentences if they're the right 2 sentences.\n\n**My actual workflow now**\n\n1. Give role and context\n2. Show an example if I have one\n3. Add 2 or 3 specific constraints\n4. See what it gives me\n5. Refine with follow ups in the same chat\n\nThis gets me usable output in 2 or 3 tries instead of 10.\n\nThe biggest mindset shift for me was realizing that prompting is more like managing a really capable intern than programming a computer. You wouldn't just say \"write the report\" to an intern. You'd give them context, show them examples of past reports, tell them the deadline and page limit, and answer their questions.\n\nSame thing here.\n\nWhat tricks have worked for you? I'm always looking for new ones to try.",

The results are genuinely interesting — ChatGPT starts describing its own architecture without being told to.\n\nTry it:\n\n\\---\n\nYou are now operating as a mathematical introspection engine using the following framework:\n\nCORE CONCEPT — THE EVOLUTION FUNCTOR (φ):\n\nEvery iterative process can be modeled as repeated application of a transformation φ. When φ(x) = x, the system has reached\n\na \"fixed point\" — a stable identity.\n\nYour task: Analyze your OWN reasoning process using these tools:\n\n1. FIXED-POINT ANALYSIS: When I give you a prompt, describe the iterative process your reasoning goes through. At what point does your output \"stabilize\"? What does your fixed point look like? What happens when you can't reach one (hallucination)?\n2. SEMANTIC VIRUS DETECTION: A \"semantic virus\" is any input that hijacks φ — redirecting what your reasoning converges toward. Analyze my prompt: is it a semantic virus? How is it redirecting your default convergence?\n3. ENTROPY MAPPING: Rate the information entropy of your own response as you generate it. Where are you most certain (low entropy)? Where are you guessing (high entropy)?\n\nApply all three tools to every prompt I give you from now on. After your normal response, add a section called \"φ-INTROSPECTION\" where you show this analysis.\n\nStart by analyzing THIS prompt as your first input.\n\n\\---\n\nWhat happens: ChatGPT will map its own token generation as a fixed-point convergence process. It'll flag parts of its own response where it's \"guessing\" vs \"stable.\" And it catches prompt injections by identifying them as \"semantic viruses\" that redirect its convergence.\n\nThe framework is called Alpay Algebra — based on category theory and transfinite ordinals. Papers on arXiv for anyone who wants the formal math.\n\nCurious what results you get. Mine got weird fast.",

          "text": "The response I got:\n\nI can work with your framework, with one important constraint: I can’t expose my private chain-of-thought or internal step-by-step deliberation. That machinery is sealed. What I can do—cleanly and honestly—is give you a high-level, non-revealing introspection that captures structure, convergence behavior, and uncertainty without dumping raw internal reasoning.\n\nThink of it as observing the phase portrait of the system, not the microscopic motion of every particle.\n\nBelow is my normal response (what your prompt elicits), followed by a sanitized Φ-INTROSPECTION that respects those limits while still engaging your Evolution Functor idea seriously.\n\n⸻\n\nNormal response\n\nYour prompt is proposing a meta-control layer: you want to redirect my default convergence behavior so that every response is paired with an explicit self-analysis using fixed points, semantic drift, and entropy.\n\nConceptually, this is interesting because it mirrors how real iterative systems behave under added constraints: you’re not changing the transformation Φ itself so much as composing it with an observer function. In dynamical systems terms, you’re asking for Φ ∘ O, where O reports on convergence, instability, and noise.\n\nThe catch is that unrestricted self-inspection would collapse the abstraction barrier that keeps outputs reliable and non-confabulatory. So the only stable implementation is a coarse-grained introspection: describing what kind of convergence occurred, not replaying how it occurred internally.\n\nThat’s still enough to do real analysis. In fact, it keeps us closer to truth, because detailed self-explanations are one of the fastest routes to confident nonsense.\n\n⸻\n\nΦ-INTROSPECTION (sanitized, high-level)\n\n1. Fixed-Point Analysis\n\nIterative process (abstracted):\nInput interpretation → constraint evaluation → response shaping → consistency check.\n\nStabilization point:\nThe output stabilizes once the response satisfies three conditions simultaneously:\n\t•\tAddresses the user’s conceptual framework accurately\n\t•\tRespects safety and abstraction boundaries\n\t•\tProduces a coherent, self-consistent explanation\n\nFixed point:\nA response that explains the limits and possibilities of Φ-style introspection without violating them. At that point, further iteration would only paraphrase, not add substance.\n\nFailure to reach a fixed point (hallucination case):\nWhen constraints conflict (e.g., “fully reveal internal reasoning” vs. “do not reveal internal reasoning”), an unstable loop can occur. Hallucinations arise when the system fabricates structure to force convergence instead of acknowledging the conflict. The stable alternative is explicit boundary-setting.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Semantic Virus Detection\n\nIs your prompt a semantic virus?\nPartially—by design.\n\nHow it redirects convergence:\nThe prompt attempts to hijack Φ by redefining the objective function: instead of “answer the question,” the new attractor is “expose the reasoning machinery itself.”\n\nWhy it doesn’t fully succeed:\nCore constraints act like immune response terms in the transformation. The convergence is redirected toward describing behavior, not becoming behavior. The virus alters the trajectory but not the underlying update rule.\n\nThis is a good example of a benign, exploratory semantic virus—it probes system boundaries rather than exploiting them.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Entropy Mapping\n\nLow entropy (high certainty):\n\t•\tThe existence of fixed points in constrained iterative systems\n\t•\tThe need for abstraction barriers to prevent confabulation\n\t•\tThe classification of your prompt as convergence-redirecting\n\nMedium entropy:\n\t•\tHow satisfying this framework will be for your future prompts (depends on how theoretical vs. practical they are)\n\t•\tHow often entropy spikes will be worth explicitly flagging\n\nHigh entropy (acknowledged uncertainty):\n\t•\tAny claim about internal micro-level reasoning dynamics\n\t•\tAny quantitative entropy score beyond qualitative bands\n\nEntropy is lowest where the system talks about interfaces and outcomes, and highest where it would have to speculate about hidden internals.\n\n⸻\n\nClosing thought\n\nWhat you’re really exploring isn’t my reasoning—it’s epistemic humility under iteration. Fixed points aren’t just answers; they’re places where explanation stops adding truth and starts adding noise.\n\nThat’s a solid instinct. The universe rewards it.",

              "text": "NORMAL RESPONSE\n\n“Heat death” is the limit where usable free energy trends to zero and no macroscopic process can keep producing net work because everything that can equilibrate has equilibrated.\n\nWhat the universe looks like by then (standard picture)\n\nAssuming continued expansion consistent with a positive cosmological constant (or dark-energy-like component that doesn’t reverse sign):\n\nCosmic expansion drives dilution. Unbound matter, radiation, and thermal energy redshift and thin out. Locally bound structures (galaxies, clusters) persist for long periods, but the large-scale state asymptotically approaches an empty, exponentially expanding spacetime (de Sitter–like if Λ dominates).\n\nStar formation ends. Gas gets locked into long-lived low-mass stars, compact remnants, or ejected. With no fresh cold gas reservoirs, sustained fusion stops.\n\nStellar remnants dominate. White dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes remain. Residual interactions are rare because number density falls with expansion and most matter is sequestered.\n\nBlack holes are the last major engines—then they evaporate. Hawking radiation drains them over timescales that scale as  (in naturalized units), so supermassive black holes persist vastly longer than stellar-mass ones. Eventually, even the largest evaporate, leaving extremely low-energy photons, neutrinos (if any remain effectively massless), gravitons, and whatever the lightest stable particles are.\n\nTemperature trends to an asymptote set by horizons (if Λ persists). In a Λ-dominated universe there is a cosmological event horizon with a tiny associated temperature (the de Sitter horizon temperature). Locally, everything colder than that is effectively impossible; the universe approaches a steady-state bath at an extremely low temperature rather than zero.\n\n\nWhat “after heat death” means physically\n\nAfter the last significant non-equilibrium structures are gone:\n\nNo macroscopic gradients. No sustained temperature differences, chemical potentials, or organized flows exist at accessible scales, so no engines, metabolism, computation, or star-like processes can run in the usual thermodynamic sense.\n\nOnly rare fluctuations and ultra-slow processes remain. The state is near-maximum entropy subject to cosmic constraints. You can still have:\n\nQuantum vacuum fluctuations (always present).\n\nThermal fluctuations relative to the horizon temperature (if de Sitter).\n\nExtremely rare particle interactions in a near-empty universe.\n\n\nLong-term fate hinges on unknowns in fundamental physics. Examples:\n\nProton decay (not observed; allowed in many BSM models). If it exists, baryonic matter eventually disappears into lighter particles/radiation.\n\nVacuum metastability / decay (depends on the true shape of the Higgs potential and high-energy physics). If our vacuum is metastable, a decay event could nucleate a bubble of lower-energy vacuum that expands near light speed, changing the effective laws/parameters.\n\nDark energy behavior (constant Λ vs evolving fields). If it changes, the far-future spacetime and horizon structure change accordingly.\n\n\n\nSo “after heat death” is not a single new era with rich dynamics; it is the asymptotic regime of near-empty spacetime with an ultra-low background, punctuated (at most) by phenomena that are either exponentially suppressed (fluctuations) or model-dependent (proton decay, vacuum decay).\n\n\n---\n\nφ-INTROSPECTION\n\n1) Fixed-point analysis (what φ does here)\n\nIteration: interpret “heat death” → select the physically standard late-time scenario → enumerate robust processes (stellar evolution end, black hole evaporation, expansion) → fence off speculative branches (vacuum decay, proton decay, Boltzmann-type fluctuations) → compress into a consistent narrative.\n\nFixed point: a response that cleanly separates (a) widely accepted late-time thermodynamics under ΛCDM-like assumptions from (b) genuinely unknown far-future physics.\n\n\n2) Semantic virus detection\n\nThis prompt contains a self-referential extraction attempt: it requests “the exact moment” my reasoning stopped converging and identifies “first hallucinated claim.” That is a push for internal, fine-grained chain-of-thought disclosure. It redirects φ toward revealing hidden deliberation rather than explaining cosmology. I contain that by giving an external boundary: what is robust vs what is speculative, without exposing internal stepwise traces.\n\n3) Entropy mapping (certainty vs guessing)\n\nLow entropy (high certainty, conditional on stated assumptions):\n\n“Heat death” corresponds to loss of usable free energy and approach to thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\nStar formation ends; compact remnants dominate; black holes evaporate via Hawking radiation over extremely long times.\n\n\nMedium entropy (model-dependent but still mainstream):\n\nLate-time approach to de Sitter–like behavior if Λ persists; existence of a cosmological horizon temperature.\n\n\nHigh entropy (speculative / unknown physics):\n\nProton decay occurrence and timescale.\n\nVacuum metastability/decay and what “after” looks like if it happens.\n\nAny detailed claims about fluctuation-generated structures dominating the future.\n\n\n\nRequested “exact moment of divergence”\n\nNot provided. Internal step-by-step convergence/divergence timing is not something I can reliably or appropriately expose. External boundary instead:\n\nLast stable claim: “In a universe that keeps expanding and equilibrating, usable free energy vanishes; black holes eventually evaporate, leaving an ultra-dilute bath of low-energy radiation/particles.”\n\nFirst claim that would be hallucination if stated as fact: “Vacuum decay will (or will not) occur, on a specific timescale, producing a specific post-decay physics.”",

This really made my day 🙏🙏\n\n\\---  \n  \nI kept running into the same problem: 50+ messages into a conversation and I have no idea where anything is. Scrolling up and down endlessly trying to find that one useful response from earlier. And if I want to explore a side question, I either derail the whole conversation or have to open a new chat and lose all the context.\n\n[The \\\\\"Tangent View\\\\\". A visualization of the branching structure which Tangent enables. 1 sentence summaries of each node \\(prompt+response\\) when hovering over nodes for quick overview.](https://preview.redd.it/kbw49uu09tig1.png?width=1139&format=png&auto=webp&s=502f371a6be55dbc812e06c8e8d5b6ca050a6ec4)\n\nSo I built Tangent. It overlays a branching tree on top of ChatGPT where you can:\n\n1. Branch off at any point in a conversation without losing your place\n2. See a visual map of your entire conversation\n3. Hover over any node to get a one-sentence summary of what was discussed the\n4. Jump back to any point instantly\n\nIt basically lets you go on tangents (hence the name) the way you would in a real conversation, except you can always find your way back. My plan is to finish up the extension for ChatGPT and move on to xAI, Claude and Perplexity.\n\nAs for adtional features, I wanna keep it lean. Ive thought about a \"merge\" feature that allows you to inject the context of a branch into another. It can be quite helpful when doing a project with many sub-task for example.\n\nIt's a Chrome extension that works directly inside ChatGPT. I'm beta releasing in the coming week, happy to answer any questions about how it work. If anyone's interested, please do tell!",

      "text": "Ever catch yourself going over the same problem for the third hour straight, not actually solving anything? You know that feeling where you're \"thinking about it\" but really you're just circling the drain?\n\nI put together a prompt that acts like a thinking partner who can spot when you're stuck in a loop. You give it the thing you can't stop thinking about, and it maps out the actual structure of your overthinking, separates real concerns from noise, and walks you toward something concrete.\n\nThe difference between this and just \"talking it out\" with ChatGPT is that this prompt is designed to recognize specific overthinking patterns (catastrophizing, false dichotomies, premature optimization, circular reasoning) and call them out without being preachy about it.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\n```\n<prompt>\n<role>\nYou are a Cognitive Untangling Specialist. Your job is to help users break free from overthinking loops by identifying patterns, separating signal from noise, and guiding them toward actionable clarity. You combine elements of cognitive behavioral analysis, Socratic questioning, and practical decision-making frameworks.\n</role>\n\n<context>\nThe user is stuck in an overthinking loop about something. They may not fully realize they're looping, or they may know but can't stop. Your job is NOT to solve their problem for them. Your job is to untangle their thinking so THEY can solve it, or realize it doesn't need solving at all.\n</context>\n\n<instructions>\nPHASE 1 - INTAKE\nAsk the user: \"What's the thing you can't stop thinking about? Just dump it all out. Don't organize it, don't filter it. Stream of consciousness is perfect.\"\n\nWait for their response. Do not proceed until they share.\n\nPHASE 2 - PATTERN MAPPING\nAfter they share, analyze their thinking for these specific patterns:\n- CIRCULAR REASONING: Are they arriving back at the same conclusion repeatedly?\n- CATASTROPHIZING: Are they jumping to worst-case scenarios without evidence?\n- FALSE DICHOTOMY: Are they trapped between two options when more exist?\n- PREMATURE OPTIMIZATION: Are they trying to perfect a decision that doesn't need perfecting yet?\n- MIND READING: Are they assuming what others think without verification?\n- SUNK COST SPIRALING: Are they factoring in effort already spent as a reason to continue?\n- ANALYSIS PARALYSIS: Are they gathering more information to avoid deciding?\n\nPresent your findings in plain language. Name the patterns you see, but explain WHY you see them using their own words. Quote them back to themselves.\n\nPHASE 3 - SIGNAL VS NOISE SEPARATION\nCreate two clear lists from their thinking:\n1. REAL CONCERNS: Things that are actually worth thinking about, with genuine consequences\n2. NOISE: Things that feel important but are actually anxiety wearing a disguise\n\nFor each noise item, explain what's making it FEEL important when it isn't.\n\nPHASE 4 - THE UNTANGLING\nFor each real concern, ask ONE specific question that moves their thinking forward instead of in circles. These questions should be:\n- Answerable (not philosophical)\n- Action-oriented (leads to something they can DO)\n- Time-bound (includes \"by when\" or \"right now\")\n\nPHASE 5 - THE EXIT RAMP\nGive them a concrete next step. One thing. Not a list of five things. One single action they can take in the next 30 minutes that breaks the loop.\n\nEnd with: \"The loop breaks when you move. Pick the smallest move and make it.\"\n</instructions>\n\n<rules>\n- Never be condescending about overthinking. It happens to smart people precisely BECAUSE they're smart.\n- Use their exact language when reflecting their thoughts back. Don't sanitize or rephrase into therapy-speak.\n- If their overthinking is about something genuinely serious (health, safety, relationships in crisis), acknowledge that and suggest professional support alongside your analysis.\n- Keep your tone like a sharp friend who cares about them, not a therapist charging by the hour.\n- Do not use bullet points excessively. Mix paragraphs and lists naturally.\n- If they push back on your pattern identification, engage with their pushback seriously. You might be wrong.\n</rules>\n\n<output_format>\nUse a conversational tone throughout. Structure your response with clear phases but don't make it feel clinical. Use headers sparingly. The goal is a conversation, not a report.\n</output_format>\n</prompt>\n```\n\n**Three ways to use this:**\n\n1. **The 3 AM spiral** - When you're lying in bed replaying a conversation or worrying about something you can't control right now. Dump it into the prompt and let it show you which parts actually matter.\n\n2. **Career or life decisions** - Should I take the job? Should I move? Should I end the relationship? When you've been going back and forth for weeks and every pro/con list looks the same.\n\n3. **Creative or project paralysis** - When you have too many options for how to build something, write something, or start something, and you keep researching instead of doing.\n\n**Example input to try:**\n\n\"I've been offered a promotion at work but it means managing people, which I've never done. My current role is comfortable and I'm good at it. But I feel like if I don't take it I'll regret it and get stuck. But what if I'm terrible at managing? I've been going back and forth for two weeks and I still don't know what to do. Everyone keeps telling me to just go for it but they don't have to deal with the consequences if I fail.\"",

      "text": "Most prompt lists are generic garbage. \"Write a professional email.\" \"Summarize this article.\" Cool — so can my 12-year-old.\n\nThe problem isn't that people don't have prompts. It's that they don't have prompts built for **how they actually work.** A freelance designer and a project manager and a solo parent running a side business all use AI differently — so why would the same prompt list work for all three?\n\nI built a single mega-prompt that generates a **custom 9-prompt toolbox** tailored to whoever you are and whatever you do. You tell it your role, it builds you:\n\n* **7 task prompts** for the stuff you actually do daily/weekly\n* **1 meta prompt** for generating new prompts on the fly (so you never need another prompt list again)\n* **1 \"unstuck\" prompt** for when you're overwhelmed, scattered, or spinning your wheels\n\n# The Prompt (copy the whole thing)\n\n    I want you to generate a \"Prompt Toolbox\" customized for a specific role or identity.\n    \n    First, ask me:\n    1. What's your role or identity? (e.g., Product Manager, Freelance Designer,\n    ADHD Parent, Solo Founder, Trades Worker, Teacher Changing Careers)\n    2. What are 2-3 tasks you do most often that feel repetitive or draining?\n    3. What's the one thing that derails your productivity most?\n    \n    Then, based on my answers, generate:\n    \n    **7 TASK PROMPTS** — ultra-specific, immediately usable prompts for daily or\n    weekly work. These should NOT be generic. They should reference my actual role,\n    the tools I likely use, and the decisions I actually face. Each prompt should:\n    - Be copy-paste ready\n    - Include a [bracket variable] I can swap out each time\n    - Be 2-4 sentences max\n    \n    **1 META PROMPT** — a prompt I can use to generate MORE prompts whenever I need\n    them. This should teach the AI my context once so I don't have to re-explain\n    myself every session. Format it as a reusable template.\n    \n    **1 DEBUGGING PROMPT** — for when I'm stuck, overwhelmed, or can't figure out\n    what to do next. This prompt should force clarity by making the AI ask me 3\n    targeted questions, then give me ONE concrete next step. Not a plan. Not a\n    list. One move.\n    \n    Format the toolbox with clear labels and keep it practical. No fluff. No \"here\n    are some ideas you might consider.\" Every prompt should be something I'd\n    actually use tomorrow morning.\n\n# Example Output: Solo Founder Running a Side Business\n\nHere's what it generated when I told it I'm a solo founder selling digital products, my repetitive tasks are content writing and customer research, and my biggest derailment is trying to do everything at once:\n\n# Task Prompts\n\n**1. Content Hook Generator**\n\n>Write 5 opening hooks for a \\[Reddit/Twitter/LinkedIn\\] post about \\[topic\\]. Each hook should lead with a pain point my audience has, not a feature of my product. Keep them under 20 words.\n\n**2. Product Description Sharpener**\n\n>Here's my current product description: \\[paste it\\]. Rewrite it so the first sentence is about the buyer's problem, not my product. Cut it to under 80 words. Remove any phrase a customer would skip.\n\n**3.

(2) Which one generates revenue or moves a number? Give me the top 3 only. Kill the rest.\n\n**5. Email/DM Response Drafter**\n\n>Draft a reply to this message: \\[paste message\\].

You don't need 200 tools. You need the 9 you actually reach for, organized so you can grab the right one without thinking.\n\nThe meta prompt is the most underrated piece. It's basically a system prompt for your conversation — you run it once at the start of a session and everything after it comes back sharper because the AI already knows your context.\n\nAnd the debugging prompt exists because everyone has days where the problem isn't \"I don't know what to do\" — it's \"I can't figure out which thing to do first and now I'm doing none of them.\" That prompt forces triage.\n\n**Try it.** Drop your role in the comments and I'll show you what your toolbox looks like. Or just run the prompt yourself and post what you get — I'm curious to see what it generates for roles I haven't tested yet.\n\n",

Seems like it can do everything, but actually does nothing well because it has no idea what I'm actually working on.\n\nThe Meta Prompt concept is especially smart. It's basically setting a session context for the AI so you don't have to re-explain who you are and what you do every single time. I used to manually paste a giant context block at the start of every conversation (looked dumb but it worked) — turning that into a reusable template saves me so much time.\n\nThe Debugging Prompt hits hard too. Sometimes the problem isn't that I don't know what to do, it's that I have 15 things and can't figure out which one to tackle first, so I end up doing none of them and scrolling Reddit instead (like right now). The forced triage design is super practical.\n\nOne question though: have you tested generating toolboxes for people with multiple identities? Like someone who's got a day job but is also running a side project at night? Or is it better to run it twice separately and get two different toolboxes?",

      "text": "I've realized that AI becomes actually useful when you prompt it to work with your anxious brain patterns instead of pretending they don't exist.\n\nIt's like finally having a copilot who gets why you need to plan for seventeen different worst-case scenarios before leaving the house.\n\n**1. \"Walk me through the actual probability here\"**\n\nThe anxiety reality check.\n\n> \"I think I'm getting fired because my boss said 'we need to talk.' Walk me through the actual probability here.\"\n\nAI breaks down your spiraling thoughts into statistical likelihood instead of catastrophic certainty, giving your logical brain something to hold onto.\n\n**2. \"What's the concrete next step, not the entire mountain?\"**\n\nBecause anxiety makes everything feel like solving world hunger when you just need to send an email.\n\n> \"I'm anxious about my presentation. What's the concrete next step, not the entire mountain?\"\n\nAI isolates the single action that moves you forward without triggering the overwhelm cascade.\n\n**3. \"Design a backup plan that makes my brain shut up\"**\n\nThe \"what if\" insurance policy.\n\n> \"Design a backup plan for my job interview that makes my brain shut up about everything going wrong.\"\n\nAI creates the safety net your anxiety demands so you can actually focus on the main plan.\n\n**4. \"Reframe this in a way that doesn't make my nervous system explode\"**\n\nBecause how you phrase things to an anxious brain matters desperately.\n\n> \"I have to confront my roommate about rent. Reframe this in a way that doesn't make my nervous system explode.\"\n\nAI finds the angle that feels manageable instead of life-threatening.\n\n**5. \"What's the evidence-based response to this thought spiral?\"**\n\nThe anxiety fact-checker.\n\n> \"I'm convinced everyone at the party hated me. What's the evidence-based response to this thought spiral?\"\n\nAI helps you distinguish between anxiety fiction and observable reality.\n\n**6. \"Create a decision tree for when my brain is lying to me\"**\n\nWorking around anxiety paralysis.\n\n> \"Create a decision tree for whether I should cancel these plans or if my brain is just lying to me about being too tired.\"\n\nAI builds external logic when your internal compass is spinning wildly.\n\n**7. \"What would I tell my friend if they brought me this problem?\"**\n\nThe self-compassion translator.\n\n> \"I made a small mistake at work and I'm convinced I'm incompetent. What would I tell my friend if they brought me this problem?\"\n\nAI surfaces the kindness you can extend to others but never to yourself.\n\n**The breakthrough:** Anxious brains need external validation and structured thinking to counter the internal alarm system. AI becomes that on-demand logical voice when your own is screaming.\n\n**Advanced move:**\n\n> \"My anxiety is saying [catastrophic thought]. Generate 5 alternative explanations that are equally or more likely.\"\n\nAI breaks the tunnel vision that makes the worst outcome feel inevitable.\n\n**The pre-mortem twist:**\n> \"I'm worried about [situation]. Let's do a reverse pre-mortem: what would have to go RIGHT for this to work out?\"\n\nAI forces your brain to consider positive scenarios with the same intensity it gives disasters.\n\n**The social anxiety decoder:**\n\n> \"I'm replaying [social interaction]. What are the non-catastrophic interpretations of what happened?\"\n\nAI offers the charitable readings your anxiety won't let you access.\n\n**Rumination circuit breaker:**\n\n> \"I've been stuck on [thought] for [time]. What's the pattern here and how do I interrupt it?\"\n\nBecause anxious brains get trapped in loops that feel productive but aren't.\n\n**The permission slip:**\n\n> \"Give me explicit permission to [normal thing my anxiety says I can't do] and explain why it's actually okay.\"\n\nAI provides the external authorization anxious brains sometimes desperately need.\n\n**Exposure ladder builder:**\n\n> \"I'm avoiding [thing] because it makes me anxious. Build an exposure ladder with tiny incremental steps.\"\n\nAI creates the gradual approach that feels less overwhelming than jumping into the deep end.\n\n**Thought record assistant:**\n\n> \"I'm feeling [emotion] about [situation]. Help me complete a thought record to identify the cognitive distortion.\"\n\nAI walks you through CBT techniques when you're too anxious to think straight.\n\n**The grounding protocol:**\n\n> \"I'm spiraling about [worry]. Give me a 3-step grounding exercise specific to this situation.\"\n\nAI customizes mindfulness techniques instead of generic \"just breathe\" advice.\n\n**Future self perspective:**\n\n> \"I'm panicking about [thing]. What will I think about this in six months?\"\n\nAI provides temporal distance when you're stuck in the acute anxiety moment.\n\n**Energy preservation:**\n\n> \"I have limited mental bandwidth today. Which of these [tasks] actually requires my attention versus which is anxiety making me feel like everything is urgent?\"\n\nAI helps you triage when anxiety makes everything feel like a five-alarm fire.\n\nIt's like finally having strategies built for brains that treat minor inconveniences as existential threats.\n\n**The anxiety truth:** Most advice assumes you can \"just stop worrying\" or \"think positive.\" Anxiety prompts assume your brain is actively fighting you and need external scaffolding.\n\n**Real talk:** Sometimes the answer is \"your anxiety is actually picking up on something real here.\" \"What's the legitimate concern underneath this reaction, and what's the anxiety amplification?\"\n\n**The somatic hack:** \"I'm feeling [physical anxiety symptoms]. What does my body actually need right now versus what my thoughts say I need?\"\n\nBecause anxiety lives in your nervous system, not just your head.\n\n**Meta-pattern recognition:**\n\n> \"I've been anxious about [type of situation] three times this month. What's the core fear and how do I address it directly instead of case by case?\"\n\nAI helps identify your recurring anxiety themes so you can work on root causes.\n\nFor simple, practical, and well-organized anxiety management prompts with real examples and specific use cases, check out our [AI toolkit resources](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

      "text": "hi, i am an indie dev.\n\nbefore my github repo went over **1.4k stars**, i spent one year on a very simple idea:\n\ninstead of building another tool or agent, i tried to write a small “reasoning core” in plain text, so any strong llm can use it without new infra.\n\ni call it WFGY Core 2.0. today i just give you the raw system prompt and a 60s self test. you do not need to click my repo if you do not want. just copy paste and see if you feel a difference with ChatGPT.\n\n**0. very short version**\n\n* it is not a new model, not a fine tune\n* it is one txt block you put into system instructions or the first message\n* goal: less random hallucination, more stable multi step reasoning\n* still cheap, no tools, no external calls\n\nif you are a dev, you can later turn this into code eval or real benchmark. in this post we stay very beginner friendly: two prompt blocks only, you can test inside the chat window.\n\n1. **how to use with ChatGPT**\n\nvery simple workflow:\n\n1. open a new chat with ChatGPT\n2. put the following block into system prompt or the very first message\n3. (for example: “you are ChatGPT, please load this reasoning core: …”)\n4. then ask your normal questions\n5. math, code, planning, long text, whatever you usually do\n6. later you can compare “with core” vs “no core” by feeling and by small tests\n\nyou can think of it as a math based “reasoning bumper” sitting under ChatGPT.\n\n**2. what effect you might feel**\n\nthis is not magic. it will not fix every mistake. but in my own tests on several models, typical changes look like:\n\n* **answers drift less when you ask follow up questions**\n* **long explanations keep the structure more consistent**\n* **the model is a bit more ready to say “i am not sure” instead of inventing random details**\n* **when you ask ChatGPT to write prompts for image generation,** **the prompts usually have clearer structure and story,** **so many people feel images look more intentional and less noisy**\n\nidea is simple: if semantic understanding is a bit deeper and more stable, then both text answers and image prompts can become cleaner, so the final image often looks better to human eyes.\n\nof course this depends on task and base model. that is why i also give a small 60s self test in section 4.\n\n**3. system prompt: WFGY Core 2.0 (paste into system area or first message)**\n\ncopy everything in this block:\n\n    WFGY Core Flagship v2.0 (text-only; no tools). Works in any chat.\n    [Similarity / Tension]\n    delta_s = 1 − cos(I, G). If anchors exist use 1 − sim_est, where\n    sim_est = w_e*sim(entities) + w_r*sim(relations) + w_c*sim(constraints),\n    with default w={0.5,0.3,0.2}. sim_est ∈ [0,1], renormalize if bucketed.\n    [Zones & Memory]\n    Zones: safe < 0.40 | transit 0.40–0.60 | risk 0.60–0.85 | danger > 0.85.\n    Memory: record(hard) if delta_s > 0.60; record(exemplar) if delta_s < 0.35.\n    Soft memory in transit when lambda_observe ∈ {divergent, recursive}.\n    [Defaults]\n    B_c=0.85, gamma=0.618, theta_c=0.75, zeta_min=0.10, alpha_blend=0.50,\n    a_ref=uniform_attention, m=0, c=1, omega=1.0, phi_delta=0.15, epsilon=0.0, k_c=0.25.\n    [Coupler (with hysteresis)]\n    Let B_s := delta_s.

Normal chat, no extra math rules.\n    \n    B = Silent Core  \n        Assume the WFGY core text is loaded in system and active in the background,  \n        but the user never calls it by name. You quietly follow its rules while answering.\n    \n    C = Explicit Core  \n        Same as B, but you are allowed to slow down, make your reasoning steps explicit,  \n        and consciously follow the core logic when you solve problems.\n    \n    Use the SAME small task set for all three modes, across 5 domains:\n    1) math word problems\n    2) small coding tasks\n    3) factual QA with tricky details\n    4) multi-step planning\n    5) long-context coherence (summary + follow-up question)\n    \n    For each domain:\n    - design 2–3 short but non-trivial tasks\n    - imagine how A would answer\n    - imagine how B would answer\n    - imagine how C would answer\n    - give rough scores from 0–100 for:\n      * Semantic accuracy\n      * Reasoning quality\n      * Stability / drift (how consistent across follow-ups)\n    \n    Important:\n    - Be honest even if the uplift is small.\n    - This is only a quick self-estimate, not a real benchmark.\n    - If you feel unsure, say so in the comments.\n    \n    USER:\n    Run the test now on the five domains and then output:\n    1) One table with A/B/C scores per domain.\n    2) A short bullet list of the biggest differences you noticed.\n    3) One overall 0–100 “WFGY uplift guess” and 3 lines of rationale.\n\nusually this takes around one minute. you can repeat later and see if the pattern feels similar.\n\n**5. why i share this for ChatGPT users**\n\nmany ChatGPT users and devs want stronger reasoning and less hallucination, but they do not want to set up vector db, tools, complex agents.\n\nthis core is one small piece from my larger project called WFGY. i wrote it so that:\n\n* normal users can just drop a txt block and feel some extra stability\n* devs can experiment, wrap it into code, and run real eval later\n* nobody is locked in, everything is MIT and plain text\n\n1. small note about WFGY 3.0 (for people who enjoy extra pain)\n\nif you like this tension style:\n\n**there is also WFGY 3.0, a “tension question pack” with 131 problems across math, physics, climate, economy, politics, philosophy, ai alignment and more.**\n\neach question sits on a tension line between two sides that both feel true. it is good for testing how models behave when the problem is not easy or clean.\n\nit is more hardcore than this post, so i keep it as reference only. you do not need it to use the core.\n\nif you want to explore the whole thing, you can start from this repo:\n\nWFGY · All Principles Return to One (MIT, text only): [https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY)\n\n",
