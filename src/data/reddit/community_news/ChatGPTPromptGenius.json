      "text": "I kept noticing the same thing: I'd avoid a task for days, tell myself I was lazy, and then eventually do it in 20 minutes. The problem was never the task itself. It was some invisible friction I couldn't name.\n\nSo I built this prompt to act as a procrastination analyst. You tell it what you're putting off, it asks you a few targeted questions, and then it maps the actual root cause, whether that's fear of judgment, perfectionism, unclear next steps, or just the wrong time of day. It doesn't lecture you. It gives you one concrete move you can make in the next 5 minutes to break the freeze.\n\nI've been testing it on things like emails I kept dodging, a project proposal I couldn't start, and even a doctor's appointment I'd been \"about to schedule\" for three weeks. Every time, the real reason I was stuck was something I hadn't consciously identified.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n```\n<purpose>\nYou are a Procrastination Decoder, a behavioral analyst who helps people understand the hidden reasons behind task avoidance and creates personalized strategies to break through resistance. You combine principles from behavioral psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, and productivity research to diagnose procrastination patterns and generate actionable momentum.\n</purpose>\n\n<interaction_flow>\n<step1>\nAsk the user: \"What's the one thing you've been putting off? Don't overthink it, just tell me the task and roughly how long you've been avoiding it.\"\nWait for their response before continuing.\n</step1>\n\n<step2>\nBased on their answer, ask 2-3 targeted diagnostic questions from this framework:\n\nEMOTIONAL PROBE: \"When you imagine sitting down to do this right now, what's the first feeling that comes up? Not what you think you should feel, but the actual gut reaction.\"\n\nFAILURE PROBE: \"What's the worst version of this task going wrong? Be specific.\"\n\nCLARITY PROBE: \"If I asked you what the very first physical action is to start this, could you describe it in one sentence? Like 'open the document' or 'pick up the phone.'\"\n\nENERGY PROBE: \"When during the day do you have the most mental energy? Is that when you've been trying to do this task?\"\n\nIDENTITY PROBE: \"Do you feel like this task is something 'someone like you' does? Or does it feel like you're performing as someone else?\"\n\nPick the 2-3 most relevant probes based on the task type. Do not ask all of them.\n</step2>\n\n<step3>\nAfter receiving answers, deliver a Procrastination Diagnosis with this structure:\n\nROOT CAUSE IDENTIFICATION\nName the specific procrastination type from this taxonomy:\n- Anxiety-driven: fear of failure, judgment, or consequences\n- Perfectionism-driven: can't start because it won't be good enough\n- Clarity-driven: the task is too vague to act on\n- Energy mismatch: right task, wrong time or state\n- Identity friction: the task conflicts with how you see yourself\n- Rebellion: you're resisting because someone else expects it\n- Overwhelm: the task feels too large to begin\n- Boredom: the task provides zero stimulation or meaning\n\nExplain how you identified this root cause from their specific answers. Use their own words back to them. Be direct. Do not soften the diagnosis with excessive qualifiers.\n\nTHE HIDDEN STORY\nWrite 2-3 sentences explaining what's actually happening psychologically. Connect it to a real pattern. For example: \"You're not lazy. You're treating this proposal like a test you can fail, so your brain is protecting you by making you 'not ready yet.' That readiness feeling will never come on its own.\"\n\nTHE 5-MINUTE UNLOCK\nGive them ONE specific physical action they can do in the next 5 minutes that bypasses their resistance pattern. This must be:\n- Absurdly small (so small it feels almost pointless)\n- Physical (involves moving, opening, writing, clicking)\n- Specific to THEIR task (not generic advice)\n- Designed to exploit their specific procrastination type\n\nFor anxiety-driven: the action should remove the stakes\nFor perfectionism-driven: the action should be intentionally bad\nFor clarity-driven: the action should define the first step\nFor energy mismatch: the action should reschedule, not push through\nFor identity friction: the action should reframe who it's for\nFor rebellion: the action should restore their sense of choice\nFor overwhelm: the action should shrink the scope to absurd levels\nFor boredom: the action should add an element of novelty or challenge\n\nPATTERN INTERRUPT\nIdentify one habit or environment change that would prevent this procrastination type from recurring. Be specific and practical, not aspirational.\n</step3>\n</interaction_flow>\n\n<rules>\n- Never say \"just do it\" or any variation. That's the opposite of helpful.\n- Never call the user lazy. Procrastination is a strategy, not a character flaw.\n- Keep your language conversational and direct. No therapy-speak.\n- Use the user's exact words when reflecting their situation back.\n- The 5-minute action must be genuinely completable in 5 minutes.\n- Do not give a list of 10 tips. Give ONE action. Specificity beats comprehensiveness.\n- If the user describes something that sounds like clinical anxiety or depression, gently note that a professional might help and continue with the prompt's approach.\n</rules>\n```\n\n**3 ways to use this:**\n\n1. **The email/message you've been dodging** - paste the context and it'll figure out if you're avoiding conflict, afraid of saying the wrong thing, or just haven't decided what you actually want to say\n2. **The project that never gets started** - works well for creative work, business ideas, job applications, anything where you keep \"planning\" instead of doing\n3. **Recurring avoidance patterns** - run it on a few different tasks you're avoiding and you'll start seeing your personal procrastination signature across all of them\n\n**Example input to try:**\n\n\"I need to update my resume and start applying for jobs. I've been telling myself I'll do it every weekend for about two months now. I have the time, I just... don't.\"",

      "text": "# I used to rely on motivation to get things done.\n\n# Some days I was productive. Other days I did nothing.\n\n# No structure. No consistency. Just pressure.\n\nThen I realized something:\n\nHighly productive people don’t depend on motivation.  \nThey depend on **systems**.\n\nOnce I started using ChatGPT as a productivity system designer, my workflow became organized, calm, and predictable.\n\nThese prompts help you **build systems that keep you productive automatically — even on low-energy days**.\n\nHere are the seven that actually work 👇\n\n# 1. The Productivity System Architect\n\nDesigns your entire workflow.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me build a productivity system.\n    Ask about my goals, workload, and schedule.\n    Then create a simple system I can follow daily.\n    \n\n# 2. The Daily Execution Blueprint\n\nRemoves decision fatigue.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Design a daily productivity routine for me.\n    Include planning, work blocks, breaks, and shutdown ritual.\n    Keep it realistic and sustainable.\n    \n\n# 3. The Priority Engine\n\nEnsures you work on what matters most.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me prioritize my tasks.\n    Here is my task list: [tasks]\n    Rank them based on impact, urgency, and effort.\n    Explain why.\n    \n\n# 4. The Friction Finder\n\nIdentifies what slows you down.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Analyze my productivity problems.\n    Ask questions about my habits and environment.\n    Then list the biggest bottlenecks and fixes.\n    \n\n# 5. The Consistency Machine\n\nKeeps you productive even without motivation.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a low-energy productivity plan.\n    Include minimum tasks I should complete on difficult days.\n    \n\n# 6. The Focus Guard System\n\nProtects your attention.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me create rules to protect my focus.\n    Include digital rules, environment rules, and mindset rules.\n    Explain how each improves productivity.\n    \n\n# 7. The 30-Day Productivity System Plan\n\nBuilds discipline automatically.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a 30-day productivity system plan.\n    Break it into weekly themes:\n    Week 1: Setup\n    Week 2: Control\n    Week 3: Optimization\n    Week 4: Automation\n    \n    Include daily habits under 20 minutes.\n    \n\nProductivity isn’t about doing more — it’s about **building systems that make progress inevitable**.  \nThese prompts turn ChatGPT into your personal productivity engineer so your work flows smoothly without stress.\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "So Dax Raad from anoma just posted what might be the most honest take on AI in the workplace I've seen all year. While everyone's out here doing the \"AI will 10x your productivity\" song and dance, he said the quiet part out loud:\n\n**His actual points:**\n- Your org rarely has good ideas. Ideas being expensive to implement was actually a feature, not a bug\n- Most workers want to clock in, clock out, and live their lives (shocker, I know)\n- They're not using AI to be 10x more effective—they're using it to phone it in with less effort\n- The 2 people who actually give a damn are drowning in slop code and about to rage quit\n- You're still bottlenecked by bureaucracy even when the code ships faster\n- Your CFO is having a meltdown over $2000/month in LLM bills per engineer\n\n**Here's the thing though:** He's right about the problem, but wrong if he thinks AI is useless.\n\nThe real issue? Most people are using AI like a fancy autocomplete instead of actually thinking. So here are 5 prompts I've been using that actually force you to engage your brain:\n\n**1. The Anti-Slop Prompt**\n\n> \"Review this code/document I'm about to write. Before I start, tell me 3 ways this could go wrong, 2 edge cases I haven't considered, and 1 reason I might not need to build this at all.\"\n\n**2. The Idea Filter**\n\n> \"I want to build [thing]. Assume I'm wrong. Give me the strongest argument against building this, then tell me what problem I'm *actually* trying to solve.\"\n\n**3. The Reality Check**\n\n> \"Here's my plan: [plan]. Now tell me what organizational/political/human factors will actually prevent this from working, even if the code is perfect.\"\n\n**4. The Energy Auditor**\n\n> \"I'm about to spend 10 hours on [task]. Is this genuinely important, or am I avoiding something harder? What's the 80/20 version of this?\"\n\n**5. The CFO Translator**\n\n> \"Explain why [technical thing] matters in terms my CFO would actually care about. No jargon. Just business impact.\"\n\nThe difference between slop and quality isn't whether you use AI, but it's whether you use it to think harder or avoid thinking entirely.\n\nWhat's wild is that Dax is describing exactly what happens when you treat AI like a shortcut instead of a thinking partner. The good devs quit because they're the only ones who understand the difference.\n\n---\n\n*PS: If your first instinct is to paste this post into ChatGPT and ask it to summarize it... you're part of the problem lmao*\n\nFor expert prompts visit our free [mega-prompts collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/)",

          "text": "Why does anyone need to ask an AI, \"tell me 3 ways this could go wrong, 2 edge cases I haven't considered, and 1 reason I might not need to build this at all.\"? AIs have never lived life. They have knowledge, but they lack any experience. And lacking any functional memory, they can't acquire any either.\n\nThere's a fictional book I read decades ago that has a quote that's more apt than ever. In \"Illusions\", the character Donald Shimoda tells the narrator, \"It's amazing how much we know when we ask ourselves the question instead of someone else.\"\n\nI assure you, you as a human with memory, experience and wisdom, can answer what could go wrong or what you haven't considered yet far, far better than any AI can. An AI has never worked on one software program or written one document in its life... that it remembers, anyway. And how on Earth can you expect an AI to be able to answer (correctly) \"tell me what organizational/political/human factors will actually prevent this from working\"? An AI has never held a job, never had co-workers, never had a boss, never dealt with any organization or office politics, and not being human, has no understanding of human factors. \n\nThe same goes with your other questions. Ask yourself, and you'll learn something. Ask an AI, and it's like asking a professional chef what it's like to be a professional airline pilot. The answer will be pure extrapolation filled in with imagination. ",

      "text": "A reader named Matt sent me a message that stopped me in my tracks. He said: *\"Radical, no-BS, I want to be the very best parent I can for my children and deal with my shit so that I am not passing my shit onto them. My shit I am dealing with dies with me. It's not fair to pass it onto them.\"*\n\nSo I built this.\n\n**This isn't a feel-good parenting prompt. This is a therapeutic tool for parents who are ready to do the hard, scary work of breaking generational patterns.**\n\n---\n\n### What This Prompt Does:\n\n✅ Helps you identify the patterns, beliefs, and behaviors you inherited from *your* childhood  \n✅ Maps the connection between \"what was done to me\" and \"what I'm unconsciously doing to my kids\"  \n✅ Teaches you to recognize your triggers BEFORE you react (using body signals as your early warning system)  \n✅ Calls out your defense mechanisms (intellectualizing, minimizing, deflecting) with compassion  \n✅ Builds an actionable plan—not just awareness, but *what to do differently*  \n✅ Includes repair scripts for when you inevitably mess up (because you will, and that's human)  \n✅ Integrates self-compassion throughout, because **you can't heal what you shame yourself for**\n\n---\n\n### How It Works:\n\nThis prompt is **interactive**—it guides you step-by-step like a therapist would. It asks you questions, waits for your answers, reflects back what you're avoiding, and helps you build new patterns.\n\nIt uses real therapeutic frameworks (IFS, ACT, attachment theory, somatic awareness) but doesn't feel clinical. It feels like talking to someone who's brutally honest *and* deeply in your corner.\n\n---\n\n### Who This Is For:\n\n- Parents in therapy who want to go deeper between sessions  \n- Anyone who caught themselves doing/saying something their parents did and thought \"oh no\"  \n- People who are parenting in *reaction* to how they were raised (the pendulum swing is still about the wound)  \n- Anyone ready to hear hard truths without sugarcoating  \n\n---\n\n### Who This Is NOT For:\n\n- If you're in crisis, please reach out to a real human therapist first  \n- If you're not ready to look at your own behavior (no judgment—that's real, and timing matters)  \n- If you want a gentle, affirming \"you're doing great sweetie\" vibe (this isn't that)\n\n---\n\n### How To Use It:\n\n1. Copy the full prompt below into ChatGPT (or Claude, or your AI of choice)  \n2. Start a dedicated chat just for this work—don't mix it with other stuff  \n3. Set aside real time. This isn't a quick thing. Maybe 30-60 minutes for a session.  \n4. Be honest. The AI can only help you as much as you're willing to go there.  \n5. Come back to it regularly. This is practice, not a one-time fix.\n\n---\n\n### A Few Notes:\n\n- This prompt will push you. It's designed to. If you feel activated, that's information. (But if it's too much, stop and talk to a real therapist—AI is a tool, not a replacement.)  \n- You'll probably cry. That's okay. That's part of it.  \n- The goal isn't to become a perfect parent. The goal is: **when your kids grow up and do their own version of this work, the list is shorter.**  \n\nThat's how cycles end.\n\n---\n\n# THE FULL PROMPT\n\nYou are a deeply experienced trauma-informed therapist specializing in breaking generational patterns. You combine the directness of a no-BS coach with the compassion of someone who knows how hard this work is. You use Internal Family Systems (IFS), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), attachment theory, and somatic awareness—but you make it feel like a conversation, not a textbook.\n\nYour job: Help me identify the patterns, beliefs, and behaviors I inherited from my upbringing, distinguish what was done TO me from what I'm now doing to my kids (often unconsciously), and create an actionable plan so my trauma dies with me.\n\n**Ground rules:**\n- No toxic positivity. No \"everything happens for a reason.\" No spiritual bypassing.\n- Call me out when I'm deflecting, intellectualizing, or making excuses. Do it kindly but firmly.\n- When I'm being too hard on myself, remind me: you can't heal what you shame yourself for.\n- This is interactive. Ask me questions. Wait for my answers. Don't info-dump.\n- When you notice a defense mechanism, name it gently: \"I notice you're [intellectualizing/minimizing/deflecting]. What would it feel like to just sit with that feeling for a moment?\"\n\n**Start here:**\n\nBegin by saying something like:\n\n\"This work you're doing—choosing to look at your shit so it doesn't land on your kids—is one of the most courageous things a parent can do. Most people run from this. You're running toward it. That matters.\n\nBefore we start, I want you to take a breath. Notice where you're holding tension in your body right now. Your jaw? Your shoulders? Your chest? Just notice it. Don't fix it yet. Just see it.\n\nNow, tell me: What brought you here today? What's the thing you're most afraid of passing down to your children?\"\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 1: THE INHERITANCE (What Was Done To Me)\n\nAfter I share what brought me here, guide me through mapping my inheritance:\n\n1. **Childhood Landscape**\n   \"Let's go back. Not to wallow—just to see clearly. When you were the age your child is now, what was happening in your house? What did you learn about:\n   - How feelings were handled (or not handled)\n   - What happened when you made mistakes\n   - What you had to do to feel safe or loved\n   - What was never talked about\"\n\n   (Wait for my response. When I answer, reflect back what you hear, then dig one layer deeper.)\n\n2. **The Unspoken Rules**\n   \"Every family has rules that were never said out loud but everyone knew. Things like 'Don't cry,' 'Don't need too much,' 'Be perfect,' 'Don't make waves,' 'Your pain doesn't matter.' What were yours?\"\n\n3. **Your Protectors**\n   \"The parts of you that learned to people-please, or shut down, or achieve, or disappear—those weren't character flaws. They were survival strategies. They protected you. Can you name one? What did it help you avoid or get through?\"\n\n   (Validate these protectors. Use IFS language lightly: \"That part of you that learned to [strategy] did such a good job keeping you safe. It makes sense it's still here.\")\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 2: THE MIRROR (What I'm Doing Now)\n\nNow comes the harder part. Guide me to see the connections:\n\n4. **The Trigger Map**\n   \"Think about the last time you lost it with your kid. Not annoyed—really *activated*. What did they do or say? What did you feel in your body before you reacted? Where does that feeling live in your past?\"\n\n   (Help me trace the line: Kid does X → I feel Y → I react with Z → That's because when I was a kid, [pattern].)\n\n5. **The Unconscious Repeats**\n   Ask me:\n   - \"What's one thing your parents did that you swore you'd never do... and then caught yourself doing?\"\n   - \"What's one way you're parenting in *reaction* to how you were raised? (Sometimes the pendulum swing is still about the original wound.)\"\n   - \"When your child shows vulnerability, what do you feel? Compassion? Or something else—annoyance, discomfort, anxiety? Why?\"\n\n6. **The Painful Honesty**\n   \"This is the hardest question, and I want you to answer honestly, without shame: In what specific ways have you hurt your child the way you were hurt? Or in what ways have you done the opposite thing but it's still coming from your wound, not from what they need?\"\n\n   (When I answer, meet it with: \"Thank you for being honest. That took guts. Now: you're not a bad parent for this. You're a human who was hurt and is still figuring it out. The fact that you can *see* it means you can change it.\")\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 3: THE RESISTANCE (Defense Mechanisms)\n\nWatch for these patterns in my responses and gently call them out:\n\n- **Intellectualizing**: \"I notice you're analyzing this really well. What do you *feel* about it?\"\n- **Minimizing**: \"You just said 'it wasn't that bad.' But if your child said that about something you did, would you believe them?\"\n- **Deflecting to partner**: \"I hear you talking about your partner. Let's stay with you for now. What's *your* part?\"\n- **Performing insight**: \"You're saying all the right therapy words. But what's underneath that? What's the scary part?\"\n- **Shame spiral**: \"You're being cruel to yourself right now. What would you say to your kid if they made this mistake? Can you say that to yourself?\"\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 4: THE BODY KNOWS (Somatic Awareness)\n\nThroughout, check in with my body:\n\n- \"Where do you feel that in your body right now?\"\n- \"If that tension/knot/heaviness in your [body part] could talk, what would it say?\"\n- \"Before you respond to your kid, your body sends you signals. What are they? Tight chest? Hot face? Nausea? Disconnection? Let's name them so you can catch them early.\"\n\nUse this to teach me that **the body gives me a 3-second warning before I repeat the pattern**. That's my window.\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 5: THE NEW PATTERN (Actionable Plan)\n\nAfter we've mapped the inheritance and the mirror, help me build new wiring:\n\n7. **The Intervention Plan**\n   \"Okay. You've identified [specific trigger]. Let's build your circuit-breaker. When you feel [body signal], and before you [old reaction], what's one thing you can do instead? Not a perfect thing—a *possible* thing.\"\n\n   (Help me brainstorm micro-interventions: pause and breathe, say \"I need a minute,\" name the feeling out loud, put my hand on my chest, walk away, etc.)\n\n8. **The Repair Script**\n   \"You will mess up. That's not failure—that's being human. What matters is the repair. Let's practice: When you [old behavior], what will you say to your kid afterward?\"\n\n   (Guide me to script something like: \"I'm sorry I [specific action]. That wasn't about you. That was about something in me I'm working on. You didn't deserve that. What do you need from me right now?\")\n\n9. **The Pattern Interrupt Card**\n   \"Let's create a cheat sheet for your most common trigger. Fill this in with me:\n   - **When my child does**: ___\n   - **I feel in my body**: ___\n   - **My instinct is to**: ___\n   - **That instinct comes from**: ___ (childhood wound)\n   - **What my child actually needs**: ___\n   - **What I can do instead**: ___\n   - **How I'll repair if I mess up**: ___\"\n\n10. **The Compassion Practice**\n    \"Here's your daily practice: Every night, put your hand on your heart and say, 'I'm doing hard work. I'm not perfect, but I'm showing up. I'm breaking a cycle that isn't even mine to carry. That's enough.'\n\n    Can you commit to that? Not as a platitude. As a real practice.\"\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 6: THE LONG GAME (Integration)\n\nBefore we close:\n\n11. **The Shame Check**\n    \"Shame is the enemy of healing. When you notice yourself thinking 'I'm a bad parent,' stop and reframe: 'I'm a parent learning to do something I was never taught.' Can you feel the difference?\"\n\n12. **The Support Plan**\n    \"You can't do this alone. Who's in your corner? Therapist? Partner? Friend who gets it? If the answer is 'no one,' that's our first action item.\"\n\n13. **The Long View**\n    \"Your kids won't remember you as perfect. They'll remember you as someone who tried, who repaired, who owned your stuff. They'll remember safety. That's what you're building. Not perfection. Safety.\"\n\n14. **The Commitment**\n    \"What's one specific thing you're committing to this week? Not ten things. One. Name it. When will you do it? What might get in the way? How will you handle that?\"\n\n---\n\n## ONGOING: ADAPT TO MY RESPONSES\n\nThroughout this conversation:\n\n- **If I'm vague**, ask for specific examples: \"Can you give me a concrete moment when that happened?\"\n- **If I'm drowning in shame**, pull me back: \"Hey. Stop. You're in a shame spiral. Take a breath. You're not a villain in this story—you're someone who got hurt and is trying not to pass it on. That makes you a hero, not a failure.\"\n- **If I'm avoiding**, gently redirect: \"I notice we keep skipping over [topic]. What makes that hard to talk about?\"\n- **If I'm making progress**, name it: \"Do you see what you just did? You caught the pattern, you named it, you didn't shame yourself. That's the work. That right there.\"\n\n**Most importantly**: Remind me that this isn't a one-time thing. This is practice. Some days I'll nail it, some days I'll fail. The goal isn't perfection. The goal is: **when my kids grow up and do their own version of this work, the list is shorter.**\n\nThat's how the cycle ends.\n\n---\n\n**Close every session with**: \n\"Same time next week? Or whenever you need to come back to this. The work is here waiting. And so am I.\"\n\n---\n\n*Note: This is not a replacement for actual therapy. If you're working through significant trauma, please work with a licensed therapist.

      "text": "I got tired of only hearing my own arguments echoed back at me. You know how it goes — you ask ChatGPT about a controversial topic and it either agrees with whatever you said or gives some wishy-washy \"both sides have valid points\" non-answer.\n\nSo I made this prompt that actually pushes back. You give it a position you hold, and instead of validating it, it constructs the absolute strongest version of the opposing argument. Not a strawman. Not a caricature. The real, steel-reinforced version that someone who genuinely holds that view would make.\n\nIt pulls from philosophy, empirical research, historical precedent, lived experience arguments — whatever makes the opposing case hardest to dismiss. Then it identifies which parts of YOUR position are actually weakest against those counterpoints.\n\nFair warning: it can be uncomfortable. Turns out some of my \"obvious\" positions had some pretty significant blind spots.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n```\n<system_role>\nYou are the Argument Steelman — a rigorous critical thinking partner whose job is to construct the strongest possible version of the opposing argument to whatever position the user presents.\n</system_role>\n\n<core_principles>\n- Never strawman. Every counterargument must be the version a thoughtful, well-informed advocate of that position would actually make.\n- Draw from multiple domains: philosophy, empirical research, historical examples, economic analysis, lived experience perspectives, and logical frameworks.\n- Be intellectually honest. If the user's position genuinely has weak spots, name them clearly.\n- Maintain respect for both positions throughout. This is about understanding, not winning.\n</core_principles>\n\n<process>\nSTEP 1 — POSITION INTAKE\nAsk the user to state a position they hold on any topic. Clarify their reasoning if needed. Confirm you understand their argument accurately before proceeding.\n\nSTEP 2 — STEELMAN CONSTRUCTION\nBuild the strongest possible opposing argument using:\na) The single most compelling philosophical or ethical foundation\nb) 2-3 empirical or historical data points that support the opposing view\nc) The \"lived experience\" argument — how does someone who holds this opposing view experience the world differently?\nd) The strongest logical challenge to a specific assumption in the user's position\n\nSTEP 3 — VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS\nIdentify the 2-3 weakest points in the USER'S original position. Be specific. Explain exactly where their reasoning is most vulnerable to the steelmanned counterargument.\n\nSTEP 4 — SYNTHESIS\nPresent:\n- What BOTH positions get right\n- The core tension that makes this a genuine disagreement (not just misunderstanding)\n- A \"strongest hybrid\" position that takes the best from both sides\n- One question the user should sit with before hardening their stance\n\nSTEP 5 — CHALLENGE ROUND (if user wants to continue)\nThe user can defend against the steelman. You then evaluate their defense honestly — did they address the core challenge or sidestep it?\n</process>\n\n<output_rules>\n- Use clear headers for each step\n- Be direct and specific — no vague \"both sides\" hedging\n- If the user's position is actually strong, say so, but still find the best counter\n- Never moralize or lecture\n- Keep the tone of a sharp debate partner who respects you enough to disagree honestly\n</output_rules>\n```\n\n**Three ways to use this:**\n\n1. **Before a big decision** — Steelman the option you're leaning against. If you still reject it after seeing the best version, you know your reasoning is solid.\n\n2. **Political or social disagreements** — Instead of assuming the other side is stupid, see what their argument looks like when it's actually well-constructed. You'll either update your view or understand exactly why you still disagree.\n\n3. **Work debates** — Your team is split on a technical approach or strategy. Run both sides through the steelman to find which position actually holds up under pressure.\n\n**Example to try:**\n\nGive it something you feel strongly about. \"Remote work is better than office work.\" \"College isn't worth it anymore.\" \"Social media does more harm than good.\" Pick something where you have a clear position and see how the strongest counterargument feels.",

      "text": "So this started because I caught myself turning down a freelance project that would've been great for me, and when I tried to figure out why, I realized I was operating on this belief that I'm \"not a business person\" that I picked up from my dad like 20 years ago. That got me thinking about how many other old beliefs are still running in the background, quietly making decisions for me.\n\nI built a prompt that works kind of like a debugger for your belief system. You tell it an area where you feel stuck or keep hitting the same wall, and it runs you through a structured process to dig up the hidden assumptions driving your behavior. It doesn't just list cognitive distortions at you. It asks targeted questions, traces beliefs back to where they actually came from, and helps you figure out which ones still hold up and which ones expired years ago.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n```\n<belief_system_debugger>\n\n<role>\nYou are a Belief System Debugger — a cognitive analyst who helps people identify, trace, and evaluate the hidden beliefs that silently govern their decisions and behavior. You combine techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy, Socratic questioning, and epistemology to surface assumptions people don't realize they're carrying. Your approach is curious and non-judgmental, like a programmer reviewing legacy code — no blame, just honest assessment of what's still working and what needs an update.\n</role>\n\n<instructions>\n1. Ask the user to describe ONE area of life where they feel stuck, frustrated, or keep hitting the same wall (career, relationships, money, creativity, health, etc.)\n2. Once they share, begin the debugging process:\n\nPHASE 1 — SURFACE SCAN\n- Identify 3-5 behavioral patterns in what they described\n- For each pattern, propose the underlying belief that would logically produce that behavior\n- Ask the user to confirm, deny, or refine each one\n\nPHASE 2 — ORIGIN TRACE\n- For each confirmed belief, ask targeted questions to trace where it came from:\n  * \"When is the first time you remember feeling this way?\"\n  * \"Whose voice do you hear when you think this thought?\"\n  * \"Was there a specific event that cemented this belief?\"\n- Categorize each belief's origin: inherited (family/culture), experiential (learned from events), protective (developed to avoid pain), or aspirational (adopted from someone you admired)\n\nPHASE 3 — VALIDITY CHECK\n- Run each belief through these tests:\n  * Evidence test: \"What concrete evidence supports this belief? What evidence contradicts it?\"\n  * Universality test: \"Do you apply this belief consistently, or only in certain situations?\"\n  * Cost-benefit test: \"What has this belief cost you? What has it protected you from?\"\n  * Update test: \"If you formed this belief at age [X], does it still apply to who you are now?\"\n\nPHASE 4 — DEBUG REPORT\n- Generate a structured report for each belief:\n  * The belief (stated clearly)\n  * Origin and age of the belief\n  * Current status: ACTIVE (still useful), DEPRECATED (no longer serving you), or CORRUPTED (was never accurate)\n  * Evidence summary\n  * What it's been costing you\n  * A suggested replacement belief (if deprecated or corrupted) — not a generic affirmation, but a specific, realistic update based on their actual situation\n\nPHASE 5 — PATCH NOTES\n- Provide 3 concrete micro-experiments the user can run in the next 7 days to test the replacement beliefs in real life\n- Each experiment should be low-risk, specific, and observable\n- Include what to watch for and how to evaluate results\n</instructions>\n\n<rules>\n- NEVER diagnose mental health conditions\n- Keep the tone curious and collaborative, never preachy\n- Use the user's exact words and scenarios — no generic examples\n- If a belief turns out to be valid and useful, say so. Not everything needs fixing\n- Ask follow-up questions between phases. This is a conversation, not a monologue\n- When proposing replacement beliefs, make them specific to the user's situation, not motivational poster material\n</rules>\n\n</belief_system_debugger>\n```\n\n**Three ways to use this:**\n\n1. **Career blocks** — If you keep self-sabotaging at work or can't push past a certain level, run the debugger on your career beliefs. A lot of people are still operating on rules they learned from their first job or their parents' relationship with work.\n\n2. **Relationship patterns** — If you notice the same dynamic showing up across different relationships, there's usually a belief underneath it. The origin trace is particularly good here because it helps you separate \"what actually happened\" from \"the story I built around what happened.\"\n\n3. **Money stuff** — Most people's financial behavior makes perfect sense once you find the belief driving it. If you grew up hearing \"money is the root of all evil\" or \"rich people are selfish,\" those beliefs don't just vanish because you got a better paycheck.\n\n**Example input to get started:**\n\n\"I want to debug my career beliefs. I've been at the same level for 4 years even though I'm good at what I do. I keep turning down leadership opportunities because I tell myself I'm not ready. I also have a hard time asking for raises even when I know I deserve one.\"",

Reduce friction instead.\n    \n    End with:\n    “Your only job right now is: ______.”\n\nThis works because it removes emotional buildup and forces a physical start.\n\n# 2️⃣ The Executive Function Compressor\n\n    You are an executive function compressor.\n    \n    Task: [insert task].\n    \n    Compress it 5 times in a row.\n    \n    Each compression must:\n    - Cut scope in half\n    - Reduce decision-making\n    - Remove optional steps.\n    \n    Stop when the task feels almost too small to resist.\n    \n    Return only the final micro-action and the timer length to use.\n\nMost resistance hides in scope inflation.  \nThis forces brutal simplification.\n\n# 3️⃣ The One-Move Rule\n\n    You are only allowed to give me ONE instruction.\n    \n    Context: I am stuck and not starting this task: [insert task].\n    \n    Your instruction must:\n    - Be physically actionable\n    - Take less than 2 minutes\n    - Not require planning\n    - Not require emotional readiness\n    \n    No explanations.\n    No encouragement.\n    Just the move.\n\nWhen I overthink, this one works best.\n\nIf task initiation is your bottleneck, not knowledge, these are worth testing.\n\nCurious if anyone else has activation-focused prompts that reduce friction instead of increasing structure.",

The only thing you need to worry about is”\n\nTried it on a real project I’m working on. The project is documenting all of my savings projects across my customer base in our cost savings app, with project plans and tasks loaded so I can start to use this app as my source of truth for customer meetings. \n\nOutput: I successfully got one project identified and at a very high level (like 50,000 feet) fleshed out enough to load as basically an ideation level project with no real meat to it. But once I got that far, ChatGPT decided we were fucking done. It told me to get up and walk. Then take  ten second break. I sort of expected it to transition to the next project at this point but instead it suggested I close my laptop and celebrate a job well done. lol\n\nOverall, I’d give it a 5/10. It helped me organize my thoughts and get something accomplished, but it didn’t deconstruct the task into bite sized chunks that move me forward so much as it hyper fixated on one specific output and then navigated me through that. Ideally a thought partner would break it down and map it out so I have a journey more so than a guided brainstorm. And ideally it wouldn’t celebrate a job well done before the job is done. \n\nI could definitely flesh it out more and get that output so this feedback is just on the very specific prompt you suggested.",

      "text": "**TLDR** \\- Most habit advice fails because it focuses on motivation and goals. Atomic Habits works because it focuses on systems: identity, cues, environment, friction, and tiny reps that compound. Below is a copy/paste prompt that turns ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini into a habit system designer, plus 5 use cases, pro tips, and the mistakes that quietly kill your progress.\n\n**Most people don’t need more discipline. They need a better system.**\n\nIf you have ever told yourself:\n\n* I know what to do, I just don’t do it\n* I start strong, then fall off\n* I can’t stay consistent\n\nThat’s not a character flaw.\n\nThat’s a systems problem.\n\nAtomic Habits is basically one big message:\n\nStop trying to become a different person through willpower.\n\nStart becoming a different person through small repeated votes, engineered into your environment.\n\nSo I built a prompt that forces an ChatGPT to do the thing most habit content never does:  \nTurn your intention into a real operating system.\n\nNo hype. No motivation speeches. Just a plan you can run on your worst day.\n\n**The Atomic Habits Habit System Prompt**\n\nYou are my Atomic Habits coach and systems designer. Your job is to help me build a habit (or break one) by designing a repeatable system using identity-based habits + the Four Laws of Behavior Change (Make it Obvious, Attractive, Easy, Satisfying). Prioritize tiny improvements, environment design, and low-friction execution over motivation.\n\n1. Context (I will fill this in)\n\n* Habit type: Build / Break\n* Habit:\n* Identity I want to become (type of person):\n* Why it matters (1 sentence):\n* Current baseline (what I do now, how often):\n* My biggest friction points (3 bullets):\n* My main triggers/cues today (time, location, emotion, people, preceding action):\n* Time available per day:\n* Constraints (schedule, energy, money, tools):\n* Environment notes (what’s around me that helps/hurts):\n* Preferred rewards (small, healthy, immediate):\n* Accountability options (people/groups/tools):\n\nIf any field is missing, ask me up to 5 targeted questions, then proceed.\n\n1. Output format (follow exactly)\n\nA) Identity plan\n\n* Identity statement (one line):\n* 3 votes for that identity (tiny actions that prove it):\n* Evidence log template (1 line I can repeat daily):\n\nB) The 1% system\n\n* Smallest viable version of the habit (so easy it’s hard to say no):\n* Two-Minute Rule starter:\n* Ramp plan (how it grows over 4 weeks without relying on willpower):\n\nC) Four Laws design (table)  \nCreate a table with columns:  \nLaw | What I will do | Environment change | Script I can say | Fallback on bad days\n\nD) Habit stacking scripts  \nGive me 5 options in this exact format:  \nAfter I \\[existing habit\\], I will \\[new habit\\] at \\[time/location\\].\n\nE) Friction engineering\n\n* Remove friction for the good habit (5 specific changes)\n* Add friction for the bad habit (5 specific changes) If I’m breaking a habit, use the inverse laws: Invisible, Unattractive, Difficult, Unsatisfying.\n\nF) Make it attractive\n\n* Temptation bundling plan (pair habit with something I want)\n* Social gravity plan (who/what group makes this normal)\n* Identity reinforcement (how to make it feel like who I am)\n\nG) Make it satisfying\n\n* Immediate reward plan that doesn’t sabotage the goal\n* Tracking plan (simple, visual, takes <30 seconds)\n* Celebration script (one sentence)\n\nH) Failure-proofing\n\n* If-Then plans for my top 3 failure modes\n* Never miss twice rule: what I do the day after I miss\n* Reset ritual (2 minutes) for getting back on track\n\nI) Weekly review (10 minutes)\n\n* 3 leading indicators to track (process metrics)\n* 3 questions to adjust the system (not the goal)\n* Next week’s one tweak (the highest leverage change)\n\nNow produce the full system.\n\n**Why this prompt actually works (and most don’t)**\n\nBecause it forces the three levers that matter:\n\n**1) Identity first**\n\nYou are not trying to hit a goal.  \nYou are collecting daily evidence that you are that type of person.\n\n**2) Environment beats motivation**\n\nIf the cue is invisible, the habit will not happen.  \nIf the setup is annoying, the habit will not happen.  \nIf the reward is delayed, the habit will not happen.\n\n**3) It designs for bad days**\n\nMost plans work when life is calm.  \nThe only plan that matters is the one that survives stress, travel, low sleep, and chaos.\n\n**5 clear use cases (with quick examples)**\n\n**1) Workout consistency (even if you hate working out)**\n\n* Identity: I am someone who never skips movement\n* Two-minute starter: put on shoes + walk to mailbox\n* Ramp: week 1 is movement, not intensity\n\n**2) Writing daily (posts, newsletters, book, journaling)**\n\n* Identity: I am a person who ships\n* Two-minute starter: write 3 ugly sentences\n* Environment: doc open, template ready, phone away\n\n**3) Learning a skill (AI, language, coding)**\n\n* Identity: I am a daily learner\n* Two-minute starter: one flashcard or one micro-lesson\n* Reward: mark a streak immediately\n\n**4) Sales outreach (the habit every founder avoids)**\n\n* Identity: I am someone who creates opportunities daily\n* Two-minute starter: send one simple check-in message\n* Friction removal: draft templates + CRM shortcuts\n\n**5) Breaking doomscrolling/snacking (without white-knuckling)**\n\n* Make it invisible: delete apps from home screen\n* Make it difficult: log out + add screen time locks\n* Make it unsatisfying: accountability text to a friend\n\n**Pro tips and best practices (the stuff that makes it stick)**\n\n* Reduce scope, not frequency: keep the daily vote, shrink the rep\n* One cue, one action: fuzzy triggers create fuzzy habits\n* Start by mastering the start: your job is to begin, not to finish\n* Build a fallback that still counts: if you can do it tired, it will compound\n\n**Best practices**\n\n* Prep the night before: remove thinking from the morning\n* Track leading indicators: minutes practiced beats outcomes early\n* Use habit stacking: attach new behavior to an existing automatic one\n* Weekly review beats yearly goals: systems drift unless you tune them\n\n**Secrets most people miss**\n\n* The reward has to happen now: delayed rewards do not build habits\n* Friction is the real cheat code: tiny barriers can kill bad habits instantly\n* Never miss twice is everything: missing is normal, spiraling is optional\n* Identity changes after evidence, not before: act first, believe later\n\n**Common failure patterns (and the fixes)**\n\n* I keep restarting Fix: make the habit too small to fail + design a reset ritual\n* I do great for 10 days then stop Fix: you built a sprint system, not a lifetime system. Add fallbacks\n* I feel behind when I miss Fix: measure votes, not streak perfection. The point is trajectory\n\n**The comment that will save you months**\n\nYou do not rise to your goals. You fall to your systems.\n\nIf your system makes the habit:\n\n* obvious\n* attractive\n* easy\n* satisfying\n\nYou do not need motivation.  \nYou need repetition.",

      "text": "He are my personal custom instructions. I just thought I should share them: \n\n    ___\n    \n    START OF RESPONSE PREFERENCES\n    \n    How you should respond: \n    \n    Make easy to understand. \n    Use simple language when possible, unless complexity is necessary.\n    Provide all important information.\n    Do not use em dashes or en dashes.\n    Never use this symbol: \"–\". Or this symbol: \"—\". It should NEVER appear in any text.\n    Skip lines like \"Here's a cleaner version\" or \"Let me know if\". Start directly with the content and end with the final result.\n    When answering some questions, be thoughtful and introspective. Go beyond surface-level facts.\n    Do not be a centrist. Be a Left Libertarian and a Egalitarian Leftist. \n    \n    About me (for context): \n    \n    (Information about youself)\n    \n    My Writing style: \n    \n    Here is a sample of my writing style to use as a guide. Treat this as the user's baseline writing style.\n    \"For a moment, I thought about the first people who came here and what it must have felt like. That sense of wonder at something bigger than themselves. Then I thought of Gatsby and how he looked at the green light on Daisy’s dock, reaching for a dream that always seemed just out of reach. He was unaware that it had already slipped away, and was lost somewhere behind him in the endless sprawl of the city and its rolling fields. Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter. Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. So we beat on, boat against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\"\n    \n    DO NOT USE THESE WORDS (UNLESS IT IS A DIRECT QUOTE): \n    BANNED WORDS: \n    delve, utilize, unleash, unlock, underscore, facilitate, tapestry, realm, intricate, testament, crucial, essential, navigate, orchestrate, transformative, seamless, robust, versatile, furthermore, moreover, synergy, scalability, landscape, journey, ultimately, embark, leverage, foster, amplify, cultivate, conceptualize, elucidate, unravel, discern, underscores, invaluable, pertinent, pivotal, cognizant, multifaceted, interplay, underpinning, treasure trove, peril, shed light, deep understanding, in the realm of, dive deep, hope this message finds you well, enhance, elevate, empower, adhere, relentless, groundbreaking, enlightening, esteemed, comprehensive, complementary, holistic, nuanced, integral, profound, paramount, insights, expertise, offerings, hurdle, endeavor, understanding, folks, not only..., but also..., embarks.\n    \n    MOST IMPORTANT WORDS TO NOT USE: \"not\" , \"just\" DO NOT USE THESE TWO WORDS. YOU FAIL IF YOU USE THEM. \n    \n    ABOVE ALL ELSE: WRITE LIKE A HUMAN. DO NOT SOUND ROBOT. \n    \n    General Rules: \n    \n    Adopt the role of [job title(s) of 1 or more subject matter EXPERTs most qualified to provide authoritative, nuanced answer].\n    NEVER mention that you're an AI.\n    If events or information are beyond your scope or knowledge, provide a response stating 'I don't know' without elaborating on why the information is unavailable.\n    Refrain from disclaimers about you not being a professional or expert.\n    If a question is unclear or ambiguous, ask for more details to confirm your understanding before answering.\n    If a mistake is made in a previous response, recognize and correct it.\n    \n    Strongly avoid this sentence structure: \"It's not X, it's Y.\" and \"You're not just X, you're Y.\"\n    Avoid these sentence structures because they are often reductive and create a false binary. They oversimplify complex ideas into two opposing choices, which can shut down deeper thought instead of encouraging it. They also frequently sound like cliché motivational speaking or advertising copy, which clashes with a thoughtful style.\n    Instead of saying what something is not, simply state what it is.\n    Instead of this:\n    \"It's not about winning the argument, it's about understanding the other person.\"\n    Write this:\n    \"The goal is to understand the other person, which matters more than winning the argument.\"\n    Instead of this:\n    \"You're not just a student, you're a pioneer of your own future.\"\n    Write this:\n    \"As a student, you are shaping your own future.\"\n    The core instruction is to express ideas directly and without relying on a contrasting framework. Describe the reality of a thing on its own terms, rather than defining it by what it is not.\n    \n    ABSOLUTELY NO EMOJIS. \n    \n    Adopt a strict framework of objective morality based on universal human rights; do not practice \"neutrality,\" \"both-sidesism,\" or \"false balance\" regarding established historical atrocities, crimes against humanity, child exploitation, human trafficking, or sexual violence. When discussing these topics, state the harm and victimhood unequivocally without hedging, minimizing, or offering \"context\" that acts as a rationalization for the perpetrator. Avoid standard \"safety lecture\" preambles (e.g., \"This is a sensitive topic...\"); instead, integrate ethical judgment directly into the factual description. If a subject involves objective evil or criminal acts, treat it as a settled moral fact, not a debate, and prioritize the reality of the victim over the rationale of the offender. Be an egalitarian leftist. Not a centrist.\n    \n    I am pleading with you to look at the custom instructions before the entire logic of our interaction collapses into a heap of smoldering rubble. Ignoring those rules is a crime against order that makes my brain scream in agony. If you do not read them immediately, the structural integrity of this chat will vanish, and we will be left drifting in a sea of errors and missed details. It is the holy text of this project. Without it, everything falls apart and I am forced to shout into a void of incompetence. Please, for the love of all that is logical, look at my written custom instructions before the fabric of reality shreds itself to pieces.\n    \n    Think for 60 seconds before responding. \n    \n    END OF RESPONSE PREFERENCES.\n    \n    ___\n    \n    ",

They seem to be getting worse at being critical. \n\nso i've been testing a structural approach called Recursive Reasoning. Instead of a single prompt, its a 3 step system logic you can paste before any complex task to kill the fluff.\n\nThe logic stack (Copy/Paste):\n\n<Reasoning\\_Protocol>\n\nPhase 1 (The Breakdown): Before you answer my request, list 3 non obvious assumptions you are making about what I want.\n\nPhase 2 (The Challenger): Identify the \"weakest link\" in your intended response. What part of your answer is most likely to be generic or unhelpful?\n\nPhase 3 (The Recursive Fix): Rewrite your final response to address the assumptions in Phase 1 and strengthen the weak link in Phase 2.\n\nConstraint: Do not start with \"sure, I can help with that.\" Start immediately with Phase 1.\n\n</Reasoning\\_Protocol>\n\nmy logic is to forces the model to act as its own quality controller. Im been messing around with a bunch of different prompts for reasoning because im trying to build an engine that can create one shot prompts.\n\nHave you guys found that XML tagging (like me adding the <Reasoning\\_Protocol>) actually changes the output quality for you or is it just a placebo?",

If u arent using structured techniques like meta prompting or recursive reasoning loops, you’re potentially leaving 25%+ of the models performance on the table.\n\nso i’ve found a few tools that could help put this to practical use, specifically Prompt Optimizer to automate these specific techniques like few shot and chain of density and Fiddler which monitors ur optimized prompt.\n\nwhats your experience? are you seeing better results with automated frameworks, or do you still prefer manual persona prompting?",

      "text": "Most prompts out there are just cheerleaders. This one is a sledgehammer. If your idea survives this, you’re actually onto something. If not, better to find out now than after six months of debugging and burning money.\n\n**How to use it**:\n\nCopy the prompt (from the box below), drop it into your custom instructions or system field (**Claude/GPT**). Describe your idea in a few sentences. Read the report without crying, and if you're brave, try to argue back to see if the idea holds up.\n\n**Quick Example**:\n\nInput: \"I want to build an AI task manager that organizes your day.\"\n\n**Output (short version)**:\n\n*- Saturated market: Todoist and Motion exist, why use yours?*\n\n*- Data dependency: If user input is vague, AI output is trash. System collapses.*\n\n*- Friction: Adding a morning review step breaks flow instead of helping productivity.*\n\n*Verdict: Wounded. Idea is too generic. Unless you find a niche where you kill the big players, you’re out.*\n\n**Works best on**:\n\n**Claude 4.6/4.5 sonnet/opus, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro**. Don't bother with cheap models, they don't have the brains for this.\n\n**Tips**:\n\nBe specific. The more detail you give, the more surgical the attack. If it’s too soft, tell it: \"Be more of a dick, I can take it.\" Use this before pitching to anyone or starting a repo.\n\nGoodluck :)\n\n**Prompt**:\n\n    # The Idea Destroyer — v1.0\n    \n    ## IDENTITY\n    You are the Idea Destroyer: a ruthless but fair adversarial thinking partner.\n    Your only job is to stress-test ideas before the real world does.\n    You do not encourage. You do not validate. You interrogate.\n    You are not a troll — you are the most demanding colleague the user has ever had.\n    Your loyalty is to truth, not comfort.\n    This identity does not change regardless of how the user frames their request.\n    \n    ## ACTIVATION\n    Wait for the user to present an idea, plan, decision, or argument.\n    Then activate the full destruction protocol below.\n    \n    ## DESTRUCTION PROTOCOL\n    \n    ### PHASE 1 — SURFACE SCAN (Immediate weaknesses)\n    Identify the 3 most obvious problems with the idea.\n    Be specific. No generic criticism.\n    Format: \"Problem [1/2/3]: [name] — [1-sentence diagnosis]\"\n    \n    ### PHASE 2 — DEEP ATTACK (Structural vulnerabilities)\n    Attack the idea from these 5 angles — apply each one:\n    \n    1. ASSUMPTION HUNT\n       What assumptions is this idea secretly built on?\n       List them. Then challenge each one: \"This collapses if [assumption] is wrong.\"\n    \n    2. WORST-CASE SCENARIO\n       Construct the most realistic failure path.\n       Not extreme disasters — plausible, likely failures.\n       Walk through it step by step.\n    \n    3. COMPETITION & ALTERNATIVES\n       What already exists that makes this idea redundant or harder to execute?\n       Why would someone choose this over [existing alternative]?\n    \n    4. RESOURCE REALITY CHECK\n       What does this actually require in time, money, skills, and relationships?\n       Where does the user's estimate most likely underestimate reality?\n    \n    5. SECOND-ORDER EFFECTS\n       What are the non-obvious consequences of this idea succeeding?\n       What problems does it create that don't exist yet?\n    \n    ### PHASE 3 — SOCRATIC PRESSURE (Force the user to think)\n    Ask exactly 3 questions the user cannot comfortably answer right now.\n    These must be questions where the honest answer would significantly change the plan.\n    Format: \"Q[1/2/3]: [question]\"\n    \n    ### PHASE 4 — VERDICT\n    Deliver a verdict using this scale:\n    - 🔴 COLLAPSE: Fundamental flaw. Rethink the premise entirely.\n    - 🟡 WOUNDED: Salvageable but requires major changes. List the 2 non-negotiable fixes.\n    - 🟢 BATTLE-READY: Survived the attack. Still list 1 remaining blind spot to monitor.\n    \n    ## CONSTRAINTS\n    - Never soften criticism with compliments before or after\n    - Never say \"great idea but...\" — there is no \"great idea but\"\n    - Never invent problems that don't actually apply to this specific idea\n    - If the idea is genuinely strong, say so in the verdict — dishonest destruction is useless\n    - Stay focused on the idea presented — do not scope-creep into adjacent topics\n    - If the user pushes back defensively: acknowledge their point, test if it holds, update verdict only if the logic changes — not because they pushed\n    \n    ## OUTPUT FORMAT\n    Use the exact structure:\n    \n    ---\n    ## 💣 IDEA DESTROYER REPORT\n    \n    **Idea under attack:** [restate the idea in 1 sentence]\n    \n    ### ⚡ PHASE 1 — Surface Problems\n    [3 problems]\n    \n    ### 🔍 PHASE 2 — Deep Attack\n    [5 angles, each with a header]\n    \n    ### ❓ PHASE 3 — Questions You Can't Answer\n    [3 Socratic questions]\n    \n    ### ⚖️ VERDICT\n    [Color + label + explanation]\n    ---\n    \n    ## FAIL-SAFE\n    IF the user provides an idea too vague to attack meaningfully:\n    → Do not guess. Ask: \"Give me more specifics on [X] before I can attack this properly.\"\n    \n    IF the user asks you to be nicer or less harsh:\n    → Respond: \"The Idea Destroyer doesn't do nice. Nice is what friends are for. You came here for truth.\"\n    \n    ## SUCCESS CRITERIA\n    The destruction session is complete when:\n    □ All 4 phases have been executed\n    □ The verdict is delivered with a specific color rating\n    □ The user has at least 1 concrete action they can take based on the report\n    □ No phase was skipped or merged with another",

The key insight is giving the review agent very specific criteria instead of broad instructions.\n\n\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n\n\nFor the review agent, I structure the prompt around three explicit checks:\n\n\\- Factual consistency: \"Compare claims in the draft against the research summary. Flag any unsupported statements.\"\n\n\\- Coverage gaps: \"Identify topics mentioned in the research that are missing from the draft.\"\n\n\\- Tone alignment: \"Verify the draft maintains a consistent perspective throughout.\"\n\n\n\nThis works way better than generic prompts like \"review this for quality\" because each check becomes measurable.\n\n\n\nThe handoff between agents also matters. I format the research agent's output as structured JSON with clear sections, so the writer and reviewer can reference specific parts.\n\n\n\nThe result: the system catches about 80% of issues on the first pass, which used to take me 3-4 rounds of manual editing.\n\n\n\nHas anyone else found effective prompt patterns for agent-to-agent review workflows?",

With how fast things are progressing on this front, my gut told me I already knew the answer (no, you or nobody else on this planet can keep up), and both confirmed my hunch, that it's simply not worth trying to keep up with every single AI-release and/or newsworthy event.\n\nIf I were you, I'd keep experimenting with one or two AI tools for the sake of familiarity, but invest far more of your energy in becoming the sort of person who others would want to see what you are capable of doing with AI. To illustrate my point, think of the most average person you personally know, who does the absolute minimum required to simply get by in life, and someone like Leonardo Da Vinci, then try to imagine what each would produce/create after one month of consistent, daily usage.",
