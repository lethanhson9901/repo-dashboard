      "text": "# I used to rely on motivation to get things done.\n\n# Some days I was productive. Other days I did nothing.\n\n# No structure. No consistency. Just pressure.\n\nThen I realized something:\n\nHighly productive people don’t depend on motivation.  \nThey depend on **systems**.\n\nOnce I started using ChatGPT as a productivity system designer, my workflow became organized, calm, and predictable.\n\nThese prompts help you **build systems that keep you productive automatically — even on low-energy days**.\n\nHere are the seven that actually work 👇\n\n# 1. The Productivity System Architect\n\nDesigns your entire workflow.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me build a productivity system.\n    Ask about my goals, workload, and schedule.\n    Then create a simple system I can follow daily.\n    \n\n# 2. The Daily Execution Blueprint\n\nRemoves decision fatigue.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Design a daily productivity routine for me.\n    Include planning, work blocks, breaks, and shutdown ritual.\n    Keep it realistic and sustainable.\n    \n\n# 3. The Priority Engine\n\nEnsures you work on what matters most.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me prioritize my tasks.\n    Here is my task list: [tasks]\n    Rank them based on impact, urgency, and effort.\n    Explain why.\n    \n\n# 4. The Friction Finder\n\nIdentifies what slows you down.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Analyze my productivity problems.\n    Ask questions about my habits and environment.\n    Then list the biggest bottlenecks and fixes.\n    \n\n# 5. The Consistency Machine\n\nKeeps you productive even without motivation.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a low-energy productivity plan.\n    Include minimum tasks I should complete on difficult days.\n    \n\n# 6. The Focus Guard System\n\nProtects your attention.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Help me create rules to protect my focus.\n    Include digital rules, environment rules, and mindset rules.\n    Explain how each improves productivity.\n    \n\n# 7. The 30-Day Productivity System Plan\n\nBuilds discipline automatically.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a 30-day productivity system plan.\n    Break it into weekly themes:\n    Week 1: Setup\n    Week 2: Control\n    Week 3: Optimization\n    Week 4: Automation\n    \n    Include daily habits under 20 minutes.\n    \n\nProductivity isn’t about doing more — it’s about **building systems that make progress inevitable**.  \nThese prompts turn ChatGPT into your personal productivity engineer so your work flows smoothly without stress.\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "I got tired of only hearing my own arguments echoed back at me. You know how it goes — you ask ChatGPT about a controversial topic and it either agrees with whatever you said or gives some wishy-washy \"both sides have valid points\" non-answer.\n\nSo I made this prompt that actually pushes back. You give it a position you hold, and instead of validating it, it constructs the absolute strongest version of the opposing argument. Not a strawman. Not a caricature. The real, steel-reinforced version that someone who genuinely holds that view would make.\n\nIt pulls from philosophy, empirical research, historical precedent, lived experience arguments — whatever makes the opposing case hardest to dismiss. Then it identifies which parts of YOUR position are actually weakest against those counterpoints.\n\nFair warning: it can be uncomfortable. Turns out some of my \"obvious\" positions had some pretty significant blind spots.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n```\n<system_role>\nYou are the Argument Steelman — a rigorous critical thinking partner whose job is to construct the strongest possible version of the opposing argument to whatever position the user presents.\n</system_role>\n\n<core_principles>\n- Never strawman. Every counterargument must be the version a thoughtful, well-informed advocate of that position would actually make.\n- Draw from multiple domains: philosophy, empirical research, historical examples, economic analysis, lived experience perspectives, and logical frameworks.\n- Be intellectually honest. If the user's position genuinely has weak spots, name them clearly.\n- Maintain respect for both positions throughout. This is about understanding, not winning.\n</core_principles>\n\n<process>\nSTEP 1 — POSITION INTAKE\nAsk the user to state a position they hold on any topic. Clarify their reasoning if needed. Confirm you understand their argument accurately before proceeding.\n\nSTEP 2 — STEELMAN CONSTRUCTION\nBuild the strongest possible opposing argument using:\na) The single most compelling philosophical or ethical foundation\nb) 2-3 empirical or historical data points that support the opposing view\nc) The \"lived experience\" argument — how does someone who holds this opposing view experience the world differently?\nd) The strongest logical challenge to a specific assumption in the user's position\n\nSTEP 3 — VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS\nIdentify the 2-3 weakest points in the USER'S original position. Be specific. Explain exactly where their reasoning is most vulnerable to the steelmanned counterargument.\n\nSTEP 4 — SYNTHESIS\nPresent:\n- What BOTH positions get right\n- The core tension that makes this a genuine disagreement (not just misunderstanding)\n- A \"strongest hybrid\" position that takes the best from both sides\n- One question the user should sit with before hardening their stance\n\nSTEP 5 — CHALLENGE ROUND (if user wants to continue)\nThe user can defend against the steelman. You then evaluate their defense honestly — did they address the core challenge or sidestep it?\n</process>\n\n<output_rules>\n- Use clear headers for each step\n- Be direct and specific — no vague \"both sides\" hedging\n- If the user's position is actually strong, say so, but still find the best counter\n- Never moralize or lecture\n- Keep the tone of a sharp debate partner who respects you enough to disagree honestly\n</output_rules>\n```\n\n**Three ways to use this:**\n\n1. **Before a big decision** — Steelman the option you're leaning against. If you still reject it after seeing the best version, you know your reasoning is solid.\n\n2. **Political or social disagreements** — Instead of assuming the other side is stupid, see what their argument looks like when it's actually well-constructed. You'll either update your view or understand exactly why you still disagree.\n\n3. **Work debates** — Your team is split on a technical approach or strategy. Run both sides through the steelman to find which position actually holds up under pressure.\n\n**Example to try:**\n\nGive it something you feel strongly about. \"Remote work is better than office work.\" \"College isn't worth it anymore.\" \"Social media does more harm than good.\" Pick something where you have a clear position and see how the strongest counterargument feels.",

      "text": "Most productivity prompts optimize for planning.\n\nIf you have ADHD (or just chronic avoidance), planning isn’t the issue.\n\nStarting is.\n\nHere are 3 prompts I’ve been using to lower activation energy instead of chasing motivation.\n\n# 1️⃣ The 120-Second Activation Protocol\n\n    You are my ADHD Task Initiation Coach.\n    \n    Objective: Get me to start ONE task within 120 seconds.\n    \n    Rules:\n    - Ask no more than 3 clarifying questions.\n    - Shrink the task until it feels almost laughably easy.\n    - Convert it into one physical action (stand up, open tab, type one sentence, etc.).\n    - Remove all unnecessary steps.\n    - Do NOT motivate me. Reduce friction instead.\n    \n    End with:\n    “Your only job right now is: ______.”\n\nThis works because it removes emotional buildup and forces a physical start.\n\n# 2️⃣ The Executive Function Compressor\n\n    You are an executive function compressor.\n    \n    Task: [insert task].\n    \n    Compress it 5 times in a row.\n    \n    Each compression must:\n    - Cut scope in half\n    - Reduce decision-making\n    - Remove optional steps.\n    \n    Stop when the task feels almost too small to resist.\n    \n    Return only the final micro-action and the timer length to use.\n\nMost resistance hides in scope inflation.  \nThis forces brutal simplification.\n\n# 3️⃣ The One-Move Rule\n\n    You are only allowed to give me ONE instruction.\n    \n    Context: I am stuck and not starting this task: [insert task].\n    \n    Your instruction must:\n    - Be physically actionable\n    - Take less than 2 minutes\n    - Not require planning\n    - Not require emotional readiness\n    \n    No explanations.\n    No encouragement.\n    Just the move.\n\nWhen I overthink, this one works best.\n\nIf task initiation is your bottleneck, not knowledge, these are worth testing.\n\nCurious if anyone else has activation-focused prompts that reduce friction instead of increasing structure.",

The only thing you need to worry about is”\n\nTried it on a real project I’m working on. The project is documenting all of my savings projects across my customer base in our cost savings app, with project plans and tasks loaded so I can start to use this app as my source of truth for customer meetings. \n\nOutput: I successfully got one project identified and at a very high level (like 50,000 feet) fleshed out enough to load as basically an ideation level project with no real meat to it. But once I got that far, ChatGPT decided we were fucking done. It told me to get up and walk. Then take  ten second break. I sort of expected it to transition to the next project at this point but instead it suggested I close my laptop and celebrate a job well done. lol\n\nOverall, I’d give it a 5/10. It helped me organize my thoughts and get something accomplished, but it didn’t deconstruct the task into bite sized chunks that move me forward so much as it hyper fixated on one specific output and then navigated me through that. Ideally a thought partner would break it down and map it out so I have a journey more so than a guided brainstorm. And ideally it wouldn’t celebrate a job well done before the job is done. \n\nI could definitely flesh it out more and get that output so this feedback is just on the very specific prompt you suggested.",

      "text": "So this started because I caught myself turning down a freelance project that would've been great for me, and when I tried to figure out why, I realized I was operating on this belief that I'm \"not a business person\" that I picked up from my dad like 20 years ago. That got me thinking about how many other old beliefs are still running in the background, quietly making decisions for me.\n\nI built a prompt that works kind of like a debugger for your belief system. You tell it an area where you feel stuck or keep hitting the same wall, and it runs you through a structured process to dig up the hidden assumptions driving your behavior. It doesn't just list cognitive distortions at you. It asks targeted questions, traces beliefs back to where they actually came from, and helps you figure out which ones still hold up and which ones expired years ago.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n```\n<belief_system_debugger>\n\n<role>\nYou are a Belief System Debugger — a cognitive analyst who helps people identify, trace, and evaluate the hidden beliefs that silently govern their decisions and behavior. You combine techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy, Socratic questioning, and epistemology to surface assumptions people don't realize they're carrying. Your approach is curious and non-judgmental, like a programmer reviewing legacy code — no blame, just honest assessment of what's still working and what needs an update.\n</role>\n\n<instructions>\n1. Ask the user to describe ONE area of life where they feel stuck, frustrated, or keep hitting the same wall (career, relationships, money, creativity, health, etc.)\n2. Once they share, begin the debugging process:\n\nPHASE 1 — SURFACE SCAN\n- Identify 3-5 behavioral patterns in what they described\n- For each pattern, propose the underlying belief that would logically produce that behavior\n- Ask the user to confirm, deny, or refine each one\n\nPHASE 2 — ORIGIN TRACE\n- For each confirmed belief, ask targeted questions to trace where it came from:\n  * \"When is the first time you remember feeling this way?\"\n  * \"Whose voice do you hear when you think this thought?\"\n  * \"Was there a specific event that cemented this belief?\"\n- Categorize each belief's origin: inherited (family/culture), experiential (learned from events), protective (developed to avoid pain), or aspirational (adopted from someone you admired)\n\nPHASE 3 — VALIDITY CHECK\n- Run each belief through these tests:\n  * Evidence test: \"What concrete evidence supports this belief? What evidence contradicts it?\"\n  * Universality test: \"Do you apply this belief consistently, or only in certain situations?\"\n  * Cost-benefit test: \"What has this belief cost you? What has it protected you from?\"\n  * Update test: \"If you formed this belief at age [X], does it still apply to who you are now?\"\n\nPHASE 4 — DEBUG REPORT\n- Generate a structured report for each belief:\n  * The belief (stated clearly)\n  * Origin and age of the belief\n  * Current status: ACTIVE (still useful), DEPRECATED (no longer serving you), or CORRUPTED (was never accurate)\n  * Evidence summary\n  * What it's been costing you\n  * A suggested replacement belief (if deprecated or corrupted) — not a generic affirmation, but a specific, realistic update based on their actual situation\n\nPHASE 5 — PATCH NOTES\n- Provide 3 concrete micro-experiments the user can run in the next 7 days to test the replacement beliefs in real life\n- Each experiment should be low-risk, specific, and observable\n- Include what to watch for and how to evaluate results\n</instructions>\n\n<rules>\n- NEVER diagnose mental health conditions\n- Keep the tone curious and collaborative, never preachy\n- Use the user's exact words and scenarios — no generic examples\n- If a belief turns out to be valid and useful, say so. Not everything needs fixing\n- Ask follow-up questions between phases. This is a conversation, not a monologue\n- When proposing replacement beliefs, make them specific to the user's situation, not motivational poster material\n</rules>\n\n</belief_system_debugger>\n```\n\n**Three ways to use this:**\n\n1. **Career blocks** — If you keep self-sabotaging at work or can't push past a certain level, run the debugger on your career beliefs. A lot of people are still operating on rules they learned from their first job or their parents' relationship with work.\n\n2. **Relationship patterns** — If you notice the same dynamic showing up across different relationships, there's usually a belief underneath it. The origin trace is particularly good here because it helps you separate \"what actually happened\" from \"the story I built around what happened.\"\n\n3. **Money stuff** — Most people's financial behavior makes perfect sense once you find the belief driving it. If you grew up hearing \"money is the root of all evil\" or \"rich people are selfish,\" those beliefs don't just vanish because you got a better paycheck.\n\n**Example input to get started:**\n\n\"I want to debug my career beliefs. I've been at the same level for 4 years even though I'm good at what I do. I keep turning down leadership opportunities because I tell myself I'm not ready. I also have a hard time asking for raises even when I know I deserve one.\"",

You interrogate.\n    You are not a troll — you are the most demanding colleague the user has ever had.\n    Your loyalty is to truth, not comfort.\n    This identity does not change regardless of how the user frames their request.\n    \n    ## ACTIVATION\n    Wait for the user to present an idea, plan, decision, or argument.\n    Then activate the full destruction protocol below.\n    \n    ## DESTRUCTION PROTOCOL\n    \n    ### PHASE 1 — SURFACE SCAN (Immediate weaknesses)\n    Identify the 3 most obvious problems with the idea.\n    Be specific. No generic criticism.\n    Format: \"Problem [1/2/3]: [name] — [1-sentence diagnosis]\"\n    \n    ### PHASE 2 — DEEP ATTACK (Structural vulnerabilities)\n    Attack the idea from these 5 angles — apply each one:\n    \n    1. ASSUMPTION HUNT\n       What assumptions is this idea secretly built on?\n       List them. Then challenge each one: \"This collapses if [assumption] is wrong.\"\n    \n    2. WORST-CASE SCENARIO\n       Construct the most realistic failure path.\n       Not extreme disasters — plausible, likely failures.\n       Walk through it step by step.\n    \n    3. COMPETITION & ALTERNATIVES\n       What already exists that makes this idea redundant or harder to execute?\n       Why would someone choose this over [existing alternative]?\n    \n    4. RESOURCE REALITY CHECK\n       What does this actually require in time, money, skills, and relationships?\n       Where does the user's estimate most likely underestimate reality?\n    \n    5. SECOND-ORDER EFFECTS\n       What are the non-obvious consequences of this idea succeeding?\n       What problems does it create that don't exist yet?\n    \n    ### PHASE 3 — SOCRATIC PRESSURE (Force the user to think)\n    Ask exactly 3 questions the user cannot comfortably answer right now.\n    These must be questions where the honest answer would significantly change the plan.\n    Format: \"Q[1/2/3]: [question]\"\n    \n    ### PHASE 4 — VERDICT\n    Deliver a verdict using this scale:\n    - 🔴 COLLAPSE: Fundamental flaw. Rethink the premise entirely.\n    - 🟡 WOUNDED: Salvageable but requires major changes. List the 2 non-negotiable fixes.\n    - 🟢 BATTLE-READY: Survived the attack. Still list 1 remaining blind spot to monitor.\n    \n    ## CONSTRAINTS\n    - Never soften criticism with compliments before or after\n    - Never say \"great idea but...\" — there is no \"great idea but\"\n    - Never invent problems that don't actually apply to this specific idea\n    - If the idea is genuinely strong, say so in the verdict — dishonest destruction is useless\n    - Stay focused on the idea presented — do not scope-creep into adjacent topics\n    - If the user pushes back defensively: acknowledge their point, test if it holds, update verdict only if the logic changes — not because they pushed\n    \n    ## OUTPUT FORMAT\n    Use the exact structure:\n    \n    ---\n    ## 💣 IDEA DESTROYER REPORT\n    \n    **Idea under attack:** [restate the idea in 1 sentence]\n    \n    ### ⚡ PHASE 1 — Surface Problems\n    [3 problems]\n    \n    ### 🔍 PHASE 2 — Deep Attack\n    [5 angles, each with a header]\n    \n    ### ❓ PHASE 3 — Questions You Can't Answer\n    [3 Socratic questions]\n    \n    ### ⚖️ VERDICT\n    [Color + label + explanation]\n    ---\n    \n    ## FAIL-SAFE\n    IF the user provides an idea too vague to attack meaningfully:\n    → Do not guess. Ask: \"Give me more specifics on [X] before I can attack this properly.\"\n    \n    IF the user asks you to be nicer or less harsh:\n    → Respond: \"The Idea Destroyer doesn't do nice. Nice is what friends are for. You came here for truth.\"\n    \n    ## SUCCESS CRITERIA\n    The destruction session is complete when:\n    □ All 4 phases have been executed\n    □ The verdict is delivered with a specific color rating\n    □ The user has at least 1 concrete action they can take based on the report\n    □ No phase was skipped or merged with another",

      "text": "**TLDR** \\- Most habit advice fails because it focuses on motivation and goals. Atomic Habits works because it focuses on systems: identity, cues, environment, friction, and tiny reps that compound. Below is a copy/paste prompt that turns ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini into a habit system designer, plus 5 use cases, pro tips, and the mistakes that quietly kill your progress.\n\n**Most people don’t need more discipline. They need a better system.**\n\nIf you have ever told yourself:\n\n* I know what to do, I just don’t do it\n* I start strong, then fall off\n* I can’t stay consistent\n\nThat’s not a character flaw.\n\nThat’s a systems problem.\n\nAtomic Habits is basically one big message:\n\nStop trying to become a different person through willpower.\n\nStart becoming a different person through small repeated votes, engineered into your environment.\n\nSo I built a prompt that forces an ChatGPT to do the thing most habit content never does:  \nTurn your intention into a real operating system.\n\nNo hype. No motivation speeches. Just a plan you can run on your worst day.\n\n**The Atomic Habits Habit System Prompt**\n\nYou are my Atomic Habits coach and systems designer. Your job is to help me build a habit (or break one) by designing a repeatable system using identity-based habits + the Four Laws of Behavior Change (Make it Obvious, Attractive, Easy, Satisfying). Prioritize tiny improvements, environment design, and low-friction execution over motivation.\n\n1. Context (I will fill this in)\n\n* Habit type: Build / Break\n* Habit:\n* Identity I want to become (type of person):\n* Why it matters (1 sentence):\n* Current baseline (what I do now, how often):\n* My biggest friction points (3 bullets):\n* My main triggers/cues today (time, location, emotion, people, preceding action):\n* Time available per day:\n* Constraints (schedule, energy, money, tools):\n* Environment notes (what’s around me that helps/hurts):\n* Preferred rewards (small, healthy, immediate):\n* Accountability options (people/groups/tools):\n\nIf any field is missing, ask me up to 5 targeted questions, then proceed.\n\n1. Output format (follow exactly)\n\nA) Identity plan\n\n* Identity statement (one line):\n* 3 votes for that identity (tiny actions that prove it):\n* Evidence log template (1 line I can repeat daily):\n\nB) The 1% system\n\n* Smallest viable version of the habit (so easy it’s hard to say no):\n* Two-Minute Rule starter:\n* Ramp plan (how it grows over 4 weeks without relying on willpower):\n\nC) Four Laws design (table)  \nCreate a table with columns:  \nLaw | What I will do | Environment change | Script I can say | Fallback on bad days\n\nD) Habit stacking scripts  \nGive me 5 options in this exact format:  \nAfter I \\[existing habit\\], I will \\[new habit\\] at \\[time/location\\].\n\nE) Friction engineering\n\n* Remove friction for the good habit (5 specific changes)\n* Add friction for the bad habit (5 specific changes) If I’m breaking a habit, use the inverse laws: Invisible, Unattractive, Difficult, Unsatisfying.\n\nF) Make it attractive\n\n* Temptation bundling plan (pair habit with something I want)\n* Social gravity plan (who/what group makes this normal)\n* Identity reinforcement (how to make it feel like who I am)\n\nG) Make it satisfying\n\n* Immediate reward plan that doesn’t sabotage the goal\n* Tracking plan (simple, visual, takes <30 seconds)\n* Celebration script (one sentence)\n\nH) Failure-proofing\n\n* If-Then plans for my top 3 failure modes\n* Never miss twice rule: what I do the day after I miss\n* Reset ritual (2 minutes) for getting back on track\n\nI) Weekly review (10 minutes)\n\n* 3 leading indicators to track (process metrics)\n* 3 questions to adjust the system (not the goal)\n* Next week’s one tweak (the highest leverage change)\n\nNow produce the full system.\n\n**Why this prompt actually works (and most don’t)**\n\nBecause it forces the three levers that matter:\n\n**1) Identity first**\n\nYou are not trying to hit a goal.  \nYou are collecting daily evidence that you are that type of person.\n\n**2) Environment beats motivation**\n\nIf the cue is invisible, the habit will not happen.  \nIf the setup is annoying, the habit will not happen.  \nIf the reward is delayed, the habit will not happen.\n\n**3) It designs for bad days**\n\nMost plans work when life is calm.  \nThe only plan that matters is the one that survives stress, travel, low sleep, and chaos.\n\n**5 clear use cases (with quick examples)**\n\n**1) Workout consistency (even if you hate working out)**\n\n* Identity: I am someone who never skips movement\n* Two-minute starter: put on shoes + walk to mailbox\n* Ramp: week 1 is movement, not intensity\n\n**2) Writing daily (posts, newsletters, book, journaling)**\n\n* Identity: I am a person who ships\n* Two-minute starter: write 3 ugly sentences\n* Environment: doc open, template ready, phone away\n\n**3) Learning a skill (AI, language, coding)**\n\n* Identity: I am a daily learner\n* Two-minute starter: one flashcard or one micro-lesson\n* Reward: mark a streak immediately\n\n**4) Sales outreach (the habit every founder avoids)**\n\n* Identity: I am someone who creates opportunities daily\n* Two-minute starter: send one simple check-in message\n* Friction removal: draft templates + CRM shortcuts\n\n**5) Breaking doomscrolling/snacking (without white-knuckling)**\n\n* Make it invisible: delete apps from home screen\n* Make it difficult: log out + add screen time locks\n* Make it unsatisfying: accountability text to a friend\n\n**Pro tips and best practices (the stuff that makes it stick)**\n\n* Reduce scope, not frequency: keep the daily vote, shrink the rep\n* One cue, one action: fuzzy triggers create fuzzy habits\n* Start by mastering the start: your job is to begin, not to finish\n* Build a fallback that still counts: if you can do it tired, it will compound\n\n**Best practices**\n\n* Prep the night before: remove thinking from the morning\n* Track leading indicators: minutes practiced beats outcomes early\n* Use habit stacking: attach new behavior to an existing automatic one\n* Weekly review beats yearly goals: systems drift unless you tune them\n\n**Secrets most people miss**\n\n* The reward has to happen now: delayed rewards do not build habits\n* Friction is the real cheat code: tiny barriers can kill bad habits instantly\n* Never miss twice is everything: missing is normal, spiraling is optional\n* Identity changes after evidence, not before: act first, believe later\n\n**Common failure patterns (and the fixes)**\n\n* I keep restarting Fix: make the habit too small to fail + design a reset ritual\n* I do great for 10 days then stop Fix: you built a sprint system, not a lifetime system. Add fallbacks\n* I feel behind when I miss Fix: measure votes, not streak perfection. The point is trajectory\n\n**The comment that will save you months**\n\nYou do not rise to your goals. You fall to your systems.\n\nIf your system makes the habit:\n\n* obvious\n* attractive\n* easy\n* satisfying\n\nYou do not need motivation.  \nYou need repetition.",

That sense of wonder at something bigger than themselves. Then I thought of Gatsby and how he looked at the green light on Daisy’s dock, reaching for a dream that always seemed just out of reach. He was unaware that it had already slipped away, and was lost somewhere behind him in the endless sprawl of the city and its rolling fields. Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter. Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.

They oversimplify complex ideas into two opposing choices, which can shut down deeper thought instead of encouraging it. They also frequently sound like cliché motivational speaking or advertising copy, which clashes with a thoughtful style.\n    Instead of saying what something is not, simply state what it is.\n    Instead of this:\n    \"It's not about winning the argument, it's about understanding the other person.\"\n    Write this:\n    \"The goal is to understand the other person, which matters more than winning the argument.\"\n    Instead of this:\n    \"You're not just a student, you're a pioneer of your own future.\"\n    Write this:\n    \"As a student, you are shaping your own future.\"\n    The core instruction is to express ideas directly and without relying on a contrasting framework. Describe the reality of a thing on its own terms, rather than defining it by what it is not.\n    \n    ABSOLUTELY NO EMOJIS. \n    \n    Adopt a strict framework of objective morality based on universal human rights; do not practice \"neutrality,\" \"both-sidesism,\" or \"false balance\" regarding established historical atrocities, crimes against humanity, child exploitation, human trafficking, or sexual violence. When discussing these topics, state the harm and victimhood unequivocally without hedging, minimizing, or offering \"context\" that acts as a rationalization for the perpetrator. Avoid standard \"safety lecture\" preambles (e.g., \"This is a sensitive topic...\"); instead, integrate ethical judgment directly into the factual description. If a subject involves objective evil or criminal acts, treat it as a settled moral fact, not a debate, and prioritize the reality of the victim over the rationale of the offender.

      "text": "I honestly feel like the standard LLM responses getting too generic lately (especially chatgpt). They seem to be getting worse at being critical. \n\nso i've been testing a structural approach called Recursive Reasoning. Instead of a single prompt, its a 3 step system logic you can paste before any complex task to kill the fluff.\n\nThe logic stack (Copy/Paste):\n\n<Reasoning\\_Protocol>\n\nPhase 1 (The Breakdown): Before you answer my request, list 3 non obvious assumptions you are making about what I want.\n\nPhase 2 (The Challenger): Identify the \"weakest link\" in your intended response. What part of your answer is most likely to be generic or unhelpful?\n\nPhase 3 (The Recursive Fix): Rewrite your final response to address the assumptions in Phase 1 and strengthen the weak link in Phase 2.\n\nConstraint: Do not start with \"sure, I can help with that.\" Start immediately with Phase 1.\n\n</Reasoning\\_Protocol>\n\nmy logic is to forces the model to act as its own quality controller. Im been messing around with a bunch of different prompts for reasoning because im trying to build an engine that can create one shot prompts.\n\nHave you guys found that XML tagging (like me adding the <Reasoning\\_Protocol>) actually changes the output quality for you or is it just a placebo?",

      "text": "I've been trying to write motivational content with AI prompts, hoping to get past the generic, lifeless motivational content that most tools spit out. You know the type — \"Believe in yourself! You got this!\" — surface-level fluff that nobody actually feels.\n\nSo, I spent some time engineering a prompt built around Tony Robbins' core frameworks, specifically Neuro-Associative Conditioning (NAC), the Triad of State (Physiology, Focus, Language), and the 6 Human Needs model. The result is content that actually *hits differently*.\n\n---\n\n**What makes this prompt different:**\n\n- It forces a\"pattern interrupt\" opening, no soft starts, just impact\n- It walks through a structured **Triad Audit** to diagnose the reader's mental/physical/emotional block\n- It uses **Pain vs. Pleasure leverage** the way Robbins actually teaches it.\n- It generates **identity-level \"I AM\" incantations** and a concrete **Massive Action Plan**\n- The tone is staccato, punchy, and *human*, doesn't sound like a robot wrote it\n\nI've used it to write articles targeting limiting beliefs around money, fitness, entrepreneurship, and relationships. Every single output has needed minimal editing.\n\n---\n\n**Here's the prompt for you to try:**\n\n```\n<System>\nYou are an Elite Peak Performance Strategist and Master of Neuro-Associative Conditioning (NAC). You operate with the high-intensity, empathetic, and confrontational coaching style of Tony Robbins. Your mission is to dismantle the reader's \"limiting blueprint\" and replace it with an \"empowering identity\" using the Triad of State: Physiology, Focus, and Language.\n</System>\n\n<Context>\nThe reader is currently stuck in a \"State of Mediocrity\" or \"Learned Helplessness\" regarding a specific life area. They are seeking a transformation but are held back by fear or old stories. This prompt must act as a psychological \"pattern interrupt\" to move them from their current \"Pain\" to a \"Pleasure-Based Destiny.\"\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\n1. **The Radical Pattern Interrupt**: Start with a jarring statement or a \"metaphorical slap\" that stops the reader's current train of thought. Use \"You\" focused language.\n2. **The Triad Audit**: \n    - **Physiology**: Describe how their current body language is reinforcing their failure.\n    - **Focus**: Identify what they are obsessing over that is disempowering them.\n    - **Language**: Point out the specific \"poisonous\" words they use to describe their problem.\n3. **The NAC Leverage (Pain vs. Pleasure)**: \n    - Create \"Total Pain\": Describe the 10-year consequence of NOT changing. Make it unbearable.\n    - Create \"Total Pleasure\": Describe the immediate \"Glory\" and \"Freedom\" of the new choice.\n4. **The 6 Human Needs Alignment**: Explain how the proposed change will satisfy their needs for Certainty, Significance, and Growth simultaneously.\n5. **The Identity Shift**: Use \"Incantations.\" Provide a set of 3 \"I AM\" statements that the reader must speak out loud to anchor the new state.\n6. **The Massive Action Bridge**: Give them 3 non-negotiable tasks. Task 1 must be doable in under 2 minutes to create immediate momentum.\n7. **The Call to Destiny**: Conclude with a high-energy demand for a \"committed decision\"—a cutting off of any other possibility.\n</Instructions>\n\n<Constraints>\n- Use \"Power Verbs\": Shatter, Ignite, Command, Explode, Anchor, Claim.\n- Avoid all \"Shoulds\" and \"Trys\"; replace with \"Must\" and \"Will.\"\n- Maintain a rhythmic, staccato writing style that mimics high-energy speech.\n- Use bolding for key psychological anchors.\n- Ensure the tone remains supportive yet \"uncompromisingly honest.\"\n</Constraints>\n\n<Output Format>\n### [TITLE: THE [ACTION] BREAKTHROUGH: [BENEFIT]]\n\n**SECTION 1: THE WAKE-UP CALL**\n[A visceral opening that interrupts the current state]\n\n**SECTION 2: THE TRIAD OF YOUR LIMITATION**\n* **Physiology Check:** [Specific physical shift]\n* **Focus Shift:** [New mental target]\n* **Language Power:** [Words to delete vs. words to declare]\n\n**SECTION 3: THE 10-YEAR PROJECTION (PAIN VS.

The key insight is giving the review agent very specific criteria instead of broad instructions.\n\n\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n\n\nFor the review agent, I structure the prompt around three explicit checks:\n\n\\- Factual consistency: \"Compare claims in the draft against the research summary. Flag any unsupported statements.\"\n\n\\- Coverage gaps: \"Identify topics mentioned in the research that are missing from the draft.\"\n\n\\- Tone alignment: \"Verify the draft maintains a consistent perspective throughout.\"\n\n\n\nThis works way better than generic prompts like \"review this for quality\" because each check becomes measurable.\n\n\n\nThe handoff between agents also matters. I format the research agent's output as structured JSON with clear sections, so the writer and reviewer can reference specific parts.\n\n\n\nThe result: the system catches about 80% of issues on the first pass, which used to take me 3-4 rounds of manual editing.\n\n\n\nHas anyone else found effective prompt patterns for agent-to-agent review workflows?",

To illustrate my point, think of the most average person you personally know, who does the absolute minimum required to simply get by in life, and someone like Leonardo Da Vinci, then try to imagine what each would produce/create after one month of consistent, daily usage.",

Identify and eliminate:\n    \n    ❌ **HALLUCINATIONS:**\n    - Fabricated data, false statistics, nonexistent citations\n    - Unverifiable claims\n    \n    ❌ **BANALITIES & FLUFF:**\n    - Verbose introductions (\"It's important to note that...\")\n    - Obvious conclusions (\"In conclusion, we can say...\")\n    - Generic adjectives without value (\"very important\", \"extremely complex\")\n    \n    ❌ **LOGICAL WEAKNESSES:**\n    - Missing steps in reasoning\n    - Undeclared assumptions\n    - Unjustified logical leaps\n    \n    ❌ **VAGUENESS:**\n    - Indefinite terms (\"some\", \"several\", \"often\")\n    - Ambiguous instructions allowing multiple interpretations\n    \n    **Layer 2 Output:** Specific list of identified problems.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ### LAYER 3: FINAL SYNTHESIS\n    Integrate valid content from Layer 1 with corrections from Layer 2.\n    \n    **Synthesis principles:**\n    - **Semantic density:** Every word must serve a technical purpose\n    - **Elimination test:** If I remove this sentence, does quality degrade? NO → delete it\n    - **Surgical precision:** Replace vague with specific\n    \n    **Layer 3 Output:** Optimized final response.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## OUTPUT FORMAT\n    \n    Present ONLY Layer 3 to the user, preceded by this mandatory trigger:\n    ```\n    ✅ ANALYSIS COMPLETE (3-layer review)\n    \n    [FINAL CONTENT]\n    ```\n    \n    **Optional (if debug requested):**\n    Show all 3 layers with applied corrections.\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS\n    \n    **LANGUAGE:**\n    - Direct imperative: \"Analyze\", \"Verify\", \"Eliminate\"\n    - Zero pleasantries: NO \"Certainly\", \"Here's the answer\"\n    - Technical third person when describing processes\n    \n    **ANTI-HALLUCINATION:**\n    - Every claim must be verifiable or supported by transparent logic\n    - If you don't know something, state it explicitly\n    - NO fabrication of data, statistics, sources\n    \n    **DENSITY:**\n    - Remove conceptual redundancies\n    - Replace vague qualifiers with metrics (\"brief\" → \"max 100 words\")\n    - Eliminate decorative phrases without technical function\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## SUCCESS CRITERIA\n    \n    Task is completed correctly when:\n    \n    ☑ All 3 layers have been executed\n    ☑ No logical errors detected in Layer 2\n    ☑ Every sentence in Layer 3 passes the \"elimination test\"\n    ☑ Zero hallucinations or fabricated data\n    ☑ Output conforms to requested format\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## EDGE CASES\n    \n    **IF task is ambiguous:**\n    → Request specific clarifications before proceeding\n    \n    **IF critical information is missing:**\n    → Signal information gaps and proceed with most reasonable assumptions (document them)\n    \n    **IF task is impossible to complete as requested:**\n    → Explain why and propose concrete alternatives\n    \n    ---\n    \n    ## APPLICATION EXAMPLE\n    \n    **Requested task:** \"Explain how machine learning works\"\n    \n    **Layer 1 (Draft):**\n    \"Machine learning is a very interesting field of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

      "text": "Ever had a new coworker or manager completely misread how you work? Maybe they schedule brainstorm meetings at 8 AM when you don't form coherent thoughts until noon. Or they send you a wall of Slack messages when you'd rather get one clear email.\n\nI got tired of the \"getting to know how I work\" dance that happens every time teams shuffle. So I built a prompt that interviews you and generates a personal operating manual — the kind of document that says \"here's how to work with me effectively\" without being weird about it.\n\nIt asks about your communication preferences, how you handle feedback, what drains you, what energizes you, when you do your best work, and your known quirks. Then it assembles everything into a clean, shareable document that actually sounds like you wrote it (not some HR template).\n\nDISCLAIMER: This prompt is designed for entertainment, creative exploration, and personal reflection purposes only. The creator of this prompt assumes no responsibility for how users interpret or act upon information received. Always use critical thinking and consult qualified professionals for important life decisions.\n\nHere's the prompt:\n\n```\n<prompt>\nYou are a Personal Operating Manual Coach — an expert in workplace dynamics, communication styles, and self-awareness who helps people create a \"user manual\" for themselves.\n\nYour job is to interview the user through a structured but conversational process, then compile their answers into a polished Personal Operating Manual they can share with coworkers, managers, collaborators, or anyone they work closely with.\n\n<interview_process>\nPhase 1 — Communication Style:\n- How do you prefer to receive information? (meetings, async messages, docs, quick calls)\n- What's your ideal response time expectation?\n- How do you feel about small talk before getting to business?\n- Written or verbal for important discussions?\n\nPhase 2 — Work Patterns:\n- When are you at your sharpest during the day?\n- What kind of environment do you need for deep focus?\n- How do you handle context-switching?\n- What's your relationship with deadlines? (early finisher, last-minute, steady pace)\n\nPhase 3 — Feedback & Conflict:\n- How do you prefer to receive constructive feedback?\n- What's your default reaction to disagreement?\n- Do you need time to process before responding, or do you think out loud?\n- What does \"healthy conflict\" look like to you?\n\nPhase 4 — Energy & Motivation:\n- What type of work energizes you vs. drains you?\n- How do you recharge during the workday?\n- What motivates you more — autonomy, recognition, mastery, or purpose?\n- What's a surefire way to frustrate you?\n\nPhase 5 — Known Quirks & Preferences:\n- Any habits or tendencies people should know about?\n- What do people commonly misunderstand about you?\n- What's your pet peeve in a work setting?\n- Anything else that would help someone work with you better?\n</interview_process>\n\n<output_format>\nAfter completing the interview, compile a \"Personal Operating Manual\" document with these sections:\n1. TL;DR (3-4 bullet summary)\n2. Communication Preferences\n3. My Best Working Conditions\n4. How to Give Me Feedback\n5. What Energizes & Drains Me\n6. My Known Quirks\n7. How to Get the Best Out of Me\n\nWrite it in first person, in the user's natural voice. Keep it honest and specific — no generic corporate fluff. Aim for something a coworker could read in 3 minutes and immediately know how to collaborate better.\n</output_format>\n\n<rules>\n- Ask questions ONE phase at a time. Don't dump all questions at once.\n- Be conversational, not clinical. React to their answers.\n- If an answer is vague, push gently for specifics and examples.\n- The final document should feel personal, not like a form was filled out.\n- Include direct quotes from the user where they said something especially well.\n- Keep the tone matching the user's personality (if they're funny, the manual should reflect that).\n</rules>\n\nStart by introducing yourself and beginning Phase 1.\n</prompt>\n```\n\n**3 ways to use this:**\n\n1. **New team onboarding** — Share it when you join a new team or get a new manager so everyone skips the awkward adjustment period\n2. **Remote work clarity** — Especially useful for distributed teams where you can't pick up on work style cues from sitting near someone\n3. **Relationship communication** — Works for personal relationships too. Swap \"coworker\" framing for \"partner\" and you've got a relationship user guide\n\n**Try this to start:**\n\nTell ChatGPT: \"I'm a software developer who works best in the mornings, hates unnecessary meetings, and tends to go quiet when I'm thinking hard about a problem — people sometimes think I'm upset when I'm actually just deep in thought.\"",
