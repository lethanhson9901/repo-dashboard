          "text": "The way “prompt engineering” gets discussed often feels like a placeholder for several different problems at once. Sometimes it’s about interface limitations, sometimes about steering stochastic systems, and sometimes about compensating for missing tooling or memory. As models improve, some of that work clearly gets absorbed into the system, but some of it just shifts layers rather than disappearing. It’s hard to tell whether prompt engineering is a temporary crutch or an emergent skill that only looks fragile because we haven’t stabilized the abstractions yet.",

Without it, you don’t build the instinct for where bugs hide, why designs rot, or how systems fail under pressure. You only notice the gap much later, when something breaks and there’s no prompt that gives you the answer.\n\nAI didn’t make people lazy.

Charles duhigg the author of power of habit best seller documented this whole thing\n\nP&G had this perfect odor eliminating technology breakthrough. Like actually worked. Sprayed it and bad smells vanished\n\nThey launched it targeting people with smelly homes. Pet owners. Smokers. Makes sense right?\n\nFlopped hard. Almost got buried\n\nBut heres the wierd part, the people who needed it most literally couldnt smell their own problem. Its called noseblindness. Your brain stops registering smells you live with everyday\n\nSo P&G had built a perfect solution for people who didnt know they had a problem. Thats a death sentence for any product\n\nThe researchers figured out something backwards. The heaviest users werent people with smelly homes. It was clean freaks who sprayed it after they finished tidying up\n\nThey werent fixing a smell. They were completing a ritual. The spray was the period at the end of the sentence\n\nThe psychology is simple. Habits need three things cue trigger reward. Febreze had no cue because the problem was invisible to the customer. But cleaning thats a cue everyone already has built in\n\nSo they repositioned everything. New ads showed someone finishing cleaning then spraying then doing this little satisfied smile. The ahh im done moment\n\nSales doubled in two months\n\nHeres how to figure this out for your own product using ai\n\nPrompt 1 find your noseblindness problem\n\n\"Analyze my product \\[describe it\\]. Identify situations where my ideal customer might have the problem i solve but not perceive it or feel urgency about it. What are the psychological or habitual reasons they might ignore this problem\"\n\nPrompt 2 discover your hidden power users\n\n\"For a product like \\[yours\\] who would be using it for reasons completely different from its core function. Think about emotional needs ritual completion or identity signaling not practical benefits. Give me 10 unexpected user profiles and their real motivation\"\n\nPrompt 3 map existing rituals to attach to\n\n\"List 20 daily or weekly rituals my target customer already does that create a natural moment of completion or transition. For each one explain how my product could become the reward at the end of that ritual instead of a solution to a problem\"\n\nPrompt 4 rewrite your positioning\n\n\"Take my current positioning \\[paste it\\] and rewrite it 5 ways where the product is framed as a reward or finishing ritual instead of a fix. Focus on the feeling after using it not the problem before\"\n\nPrompt 5 stress test for invisible problems\n\n\"Play devils advocate. If my customer cant see feel or measure the problem my product solves why would they ever buy it. Give me 5 alternative angles that dont rely on problem awareness at all\"\n\nThe thing most people miss is this P&G didnt change the product at all. Same formula. Same bottle. They just stopped selling what it did and started selling how it made you feel when you were done\n\nYour real competition isnt other products. Its your customers brain not noticing they need you",

I was using a pre paid account with < 10 USD for some experimentation and had a few requests that caused gpt-5.2 to be on a loop and consuming 8M output tokens (˜100USD) in seconds.\n\nMy script never got the response, but I can see in the [platform.openai.com](http://platform.openai.com/) the logs and the output is broken with a endless count of the same word \"reifen\".\n\nThe support tells me that any limits in the platform are only \"soft\", so even without pre-paid balance and billing limits, it does nothing...\n\nMaybe its different setup for enterprises, but this is a warning for the many people which are vibecoding and don't know much what they are doing! One day you might face a bill which will break the bank!\n\nShitty but lesson learned. Still asking the support because I don't think its obvious behaviour, specially with auto recharge off and the UI saying *\"Auto recharge is off -- When your credit balance reaches $0, your API requests will stop working. Enable automatic recharge to automatically keep your credit balance topped up.\"*\n\nTell your stories below if you faced this before.",

      "text": "The AI video generation market has changed dramatically in the past year, with native audio generation and longer video lengths becoming standard.\n\nHere is what I found across tiers:\n\n# Premium Tier (Cinematic Quality)\n\n|Tool|Best For|Max Length|Resolution|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n||||||\n|Google Veo 3.1|Photorealism + audio|60 sec|4K|$35–249/mo|\n|Sora 2|Storytelling|35 sec|1080p|$20–200/mo|\n|Kling 3|Volume + value|3 min|4K|$6.99–99/mo|\n|Runway Gen-4.5|Creative control|40 sec|720p (upscalable)|$15–95/mo|\n\n# Value Tier (Strong Quality, Better Pricing)\n\n|Tool|Best For|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n||||\n|Luma Dream Machine|Fast generation|$9.99–99.99/mo|\n|Pika 2.5|Creative effects|$10–95/mo|\n|Hailuo AI|Viral content|Free tier available|\n|Seedance 1.5|Multi-shot storytelling|\\~$20/mo|\n\n# Business Tier (Avatars & Corporate)\n\n|Tool|Best For|Languages|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|||||\n|Cliptalk AI|Talking avatars (up to 5 min)|Multiple|$19/mo|\n|Synthesia|Enterprise training|140+|$29–89/mo|\n|HeyGen|Marketing videos|175+|$29–89/mo|\n|InVideo AI|YouTube content|Multiple|$28–100/mo|\n|Pictory AI|Blog-to-video|Multiple|$19–99/mo|\n\n# Key Findings\n\n1. **Best Free Option:** Kling 3 with 66 daily credits that refresh every 24 hours. Enough for 1–6 short videos per day.\n2. **Longest Videos:** Kling 3 at 3 minutes max (with extensions). Everyone else caps at 60 seconds or less — except Cliptalk AI, which supports talking avatar videos up to 5 minutes.\n3. **Native Audio:** Veo 3.1 generates synced dialogue and sound effects from text. Runway added audio in December 2025. Game changer.\n4. **Talking Avatars:** Cliptalk AI stands out for longer-form talking head videos. If you need a realistic avatar presenting content for up to 5 minutes, this is the tool to look at.\n5. **Character Consistency:** Still the hardest problem. Best approach is using reference images and generating all shots in single sessions.\n6. **Price Drops:** Cost per minute dropped 65% from 2024 to 2025. Competition from Kling is driving prices down industry-wide.\n\n# My Recommendations\n\n* **For social media volume:** Kling 3 (best price-to-quality)\n* **For cinematic quality:** Veo 3.1 or Sora 2\n* **For talking avatar videos:** Cliptalk AI (up to 5 minutes)\n* **For corporate training:** Synthesia\n* **For creative experimentation:** Runway or Pika\n* **For blog/content repurposing:** Pictory AI\n* **For e-commerce ads:** Topview AI or Jogg AI\n\nWhat AI video generator are you currently using? Curious what is working for others in 2026.",
