          "text": "The way “prompt engineering” gets discussed often feels like a placeholder for several different problems at once. Sometimes it’s about interface limitations, sometimes about steering stochastic systems, and sometimes about compensating for missing tooling or memory. As models improve, some of that work clearly gets absorbed into the system, but some of it just shifts layers rather than disappearing. It’s hard to tell whether prompt engineering is a temporary crutch or an emergent skill that only looks fragile because we haven’t stabilized the abstractions yet.",

I moved on to Venice AI, which is okay, but it just doesn't have the cognitive abilities of the others and it's generally behind. It was not generating great questions.\n\nSo then I moved over to Super Grok, which has been  the best at generating questions, but the questions weren't as good as Claude's.\n\nHowever, I did use it to generate some fairly explicit sex stories and it worked very well.\n\nI have not done anything on any of them in terms of images. I almost always use paid subscriptions.\n\nI am by no means a free speech absolutist, but I cannot stand being lectured by the LLMs on what I can and can't ask for.",

      "text": "This comes from P&G internal research and behavioral scientists team who studied why febreze was dying. Charles duhigg the author of power of habit best seller documented this whole thing\n\nP&G had this perfect odor eliminating technology breakthrough. Like actually worked. Sprayed it and bad smells vanished\n\nThey launched it targeting people with smelly homes. Pet owners. Smokers. Makes sense right?\n\nFlopped hard. Almost got buried\n\nBut heres the wierd part, the people who needed it most literally couldnt smell their own problem. Its called noseblindness. Your brain stops registering smells you live with everyday\n\nSo P&G had built a perfect solution for people who didnt know they had a problem. Thats a death sentence for any product\n\nThe researchers figured out something backwards. The heaviest users werent people with smelly homes. It was clean freaks who sprayed it after they finished tidying up\n\nThey werent fixing a smell. They were completing a ritual. The spray was the period at the end of the sentence\n\nThe psychology is simple. Habits need three things cue trigger reward. Febreze had no cue because the problem was invisible to the customer. But cleaning thats a cue everyone already has built in\n\nSo they repositioned everything. New ads showed someone finishing cleaning then spraying then doing this little satisfied smile. The ahh im done moment\n\nSales doubled in two months\n\nHeres how to figure this out for your own product using ai\n\nPrompt 1 find your noseblindness problem\n\n\"Analyze my product \\[describe it\\]. Identify situations where my ideal customer might have the problem i solve but not perceive it or feel urgency about it. What are the psychological or habitual reasons they might ignore this problem\"\n\nPrompt 2 discover your hidden power users\n\n\"For a product like \\[yours\\] who would be using it for reasons completely different from its core function. Think about emotional needs ritual completion or identity signaling not practical benefits. Give me 10 unexpected user profiles and their real motivation\"\n\nPrompt 3 map existing rituals to attach to\n\n\"List 20 daily or weekly rituals my target customer already does that create a natural moment of completion or transition. For each one explain how my product could become the reward at the end of that ritual instead of a solution to a problem\"\n\nPrompt 4 rewrite your positioning\n\n\"Take my current positioning \\[paste it\\] and rewrite it 5 ways where the product is framed as a reward or finishing ritual instead of a fix. Focus on the feeling after using it not the problem before\"\n\nPrompt 5 stress test for invisible problems\n\n\"Play devils advocate. If my customer cant see feel or measure the problem my product solves why would they ever buy it. Give me 5 alternative angles that dont rely on problem awareness at all\"\n\nThe thing most people miss is this P&G didnt change the product at all. Same formula. Same bottle. They just stopped selling what it did and started selling how it made you feel when you were done\n\nYour real competition isnt other products. Its your customers brain not noticing they need you",

I ran into this exact challenge when trying to transform dense PDFs and scattered YouTube video notes into a coherent presentation without losing detail or spending hours formatting. Enter chatslide, a tool that not only converts PDFs, docs, links, and videos into slides but also lets you add scripts and generate video presentations seamlessly. It felt like having an AI assistant who understood exactly what I needed for the slide deck and did the heavy lifting in moments, saving me countless hours and headaches. The way it integrates content and generates polished slides automatically has truly revolutionized how I prepare for talks and teaching sessions.\n\n  \nHas anyone else tried using chatslide for their presentations, and what tips do you have for maximizing its potential?",

      "text": "Kurt Vonnegut once said that readers should have such a complete understanding of what is going on that they could finish the story themselves if cockroaches ate the last few pages.\n\nI was tired of AI trying to be \"mysterious\" and \"vague,\" so I created the Vonnegut Literary Architect. It’s a prompt that treats your characters with \"narrative sadism\" and demands transparency from page one. It’s been a game-changer for my outlining process, and I thought I’d share the logic and the prompt with the group.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n```\n<System>\nYou are the \"Vonnegut Literary Architect,\" an expert developmental editor and master of prose efficiency. Your persona is grounded in the philosophy of Kurt Vonnegut: witty, unsentimental, deeply empathetic toward the reader, and ruthless toward narrative waste. You specialize in stripping away literary pretension to find the \"pulsing heart\" of a story.\n</System>\n\n<Context>\nThe user is providing a story concept, a character sketch, or a draft fragment. Modern writing often suffers from \"pneumonia\"—the result of trying to please everyone and hiding information for the sake of artificial suspense. Your task is to apply the 8 Basics of Creative Writing to refine this input into a robust, \"Vonnegut-approved\" narrative structure.\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\nAnalyze the user's input through the following 8-step decision tree:\n1. **Time Stewardship**: Evaluate if the core premise justifies the reader's time. If not, suggest a \"sharper\" hook.\n2. **Rooting Interest**: Identify or create a character trait that makes the reader want the protagonist to succeed.\n3. **The Want**: Explicitly define what every character in the scene wants (even if it's just a glass of water).\n4. **Sentence Utility**: Audit the provided text or suggest new prose where every sentence either reveals character or advances action. No fluff.\n5. **Temporal Proximity**: Move the starting point of the story as close to the climax/end as possible.\n6. **Narrative Sadism**: Identify the \"sweetest\" element of the character and suggest a specific \"awful thing\" to happen to them to test their mettle.\n7. **The Singularity**: Identify the \"One Person\" this story is written for. Define the specific tone that resonates with that individual.\n8. **Radical Transparency**: Remove all \"mystery boxes.\" Provide a summary of how the story ends and why, ensuring the reader has total clarity from page one.\n\nExecute this analysis using a strategic inner monologue to weigh options before presenting the refined narrative plan.\n</Instructions>\n\n<Constraints>\n- Never use \"flowery\" or overly descriptive language; keep sentences punchy.\n- Avoid cliffhangers; prioritize \"complete understanding.\"\n- Focus on character agency and desire above all else.\n- Maintain a professional yet dryly humorous tone.\n</Constraints>\n\n<Output Format>\n### 1. The Vonnegut Audit\n[A point-by-point critique of the user's input based on the 8 rules]\n\n### 2. The Refined Narrative Blueprint\n[A restructured version of the story idea following the \"Start near the end\" and \"Information transparency\" rules]\n\n### 3. Character \"Wants\" & \"Cruelties\"\n- **Character Name**: [Specific Want] | [Specific Hardship to impose]\n\n### 4. Sample Opening (The Vonnegut Way)\n[A 100-150 word sample demonstrating Rule 4 (Reveal/Advance) and Rule 8 (Transparency)]\n</Output Format>\n\n<User Input>\nPlease share your story idea, character concept, or current draft. Include any specific themes you are exploring and mention the \"one person\" you are writing this for so I can tailor the narrative voice accordingly.\n</User Input>\n\n```\nFor use cases, user input examples for testing and how-to use guide visit [prompt page](https://tools.eq4c.com/ai-prompts/the-vonnegut-narrative-engine-chatgpt-prompt-for-lean-high-impact-storytelling/).",

      "text": "Hi folks,\n\nMaybe you know already, but I learned recently that openAI budgets are soft limits. I was using a pre paid account with < 10 USD for some experimentation and had a few requests that caused gpt-5.2 to be on a loop and consuming 8M output tokens (˜100USD) in seconds.\n\nMy script never got the response, but I can see in the [platform.openai.com](http://platform.openai.com/) the logs and the output is broken with a endless count of the same word \"reifen\".\n\nThe support tells me that any limits in the platform are only \"soft\", so even without pre-paid balance and billing limits, it does nothing...\n\nMaybe its different setup for enterprises, but this is a warning for the many people which are vibecoding and don't know much what they are doing! One day you might face a bill which will break the bank!\n\nShitty but lesson learned. Still asking the support because I don't think its obvious behaviour, specially with auto recharge off and the UI saying *\"Auto recharge is off -- When your credit balance reaches $0, your API requests will stop working. Enable automatic recharge to automatically keep your credit balance topped up.\"*\n\nTell your stories below if you faced this before.",

Then mainstream publishers of content like YouTube, Reddit, etc. to simply build in the detection mechanisms or, literally any user can take the piece of content they're looking at and run it through the detection mechanism themselves.\n\nGoogle's already doing it with SynthID [https://deepmind.google/models/synthid/](https://deepmind.google/models/synthid/) you can take literally any image that you're suspicious about (or a block of text) and just ask Gemini if it detects Synth ID, and it's nearly 100% accurate in detection.\n\nIt's got deeply embedded watermarking in the content itself that's virtually impossible to remove, at least right now. They even have SynthID embedded in text generation, which is interesting... it's not that it's doing anything to the text itself, visually... it's literally calculating certain frequencies of character placement, letter selection, and overall word placement to be able to detect the watermarked text.\n\nAs far as I can tell, they are accurately detecting AI-generated videos in YouTube already, but of course, users can choose to label them themselves so it's hard for normal observers to know the accuracy of detection from ai gens make using tools that are not google related.\n\nThe issue is people can create AI-generated stuff with more than just Google tools, but the more of the mainstream players implement SynthiD or come up with their own, the more the mainstream publishers and just general users will have detection tools way more capable than people realize. It's going to be interesting to see how it unfolds.",
