      "text": "Ever been stuck staring at a massive report or an article wondering how to turn it into slides without losing your mind? Most of us hit the wall when trying to pick out the gold and ditch the noise for a presentation that's clear and to the point. Here’s a simple step-by-step you can try right now: - Skim your document to find the 3–5 main ideas per section. - Create a single headline for each idea, which will become your slide title. - Under each headline, add 2–3 supporting bullet points. - Stick to a uniform layout so your slides look clean and consistent. For example, if a section covers \"Quarterly Sales,\" your slide title might be \"Q1 Sales Highlights,\" followed by bullets like \"Up 8% over previous quarter,\" \"New customer segment growth,\" and \"Challenges with supply chain.\" Watch out for common trip-ups: cramming too much text on one slide can overwhelm your audience, and trying to paraphrase every sentence wastes time and confuses the message. Instead, focus on clear summaries. If this process feels tedious, tools like chatslide can help by converting PDFs, docs, web links, or even YouTube videos directly into slides, plus generate speaker scripts or presentation videos automatically. How do you usually tackle transforming dense documents into slides, and what hurdles do you face the most?",

I've been experimenting with Gamma app's AI agents lately, and they're surprisingly good at this. You can upload a PDF or doc, and the agent will try to pull out the key insights and structure them into a logical flow, even if the original document is super dense. It's not perfect, but it's saved me a ton of time compared to manually summarizing everything. Plus, you can ask it to rewrite sections or search for supporting info directly within the document, which helps keep the context intact.

      "text": "[https://getdraft.dev](https://getdraft.dev)\n\nAI coding tools are fast. They're also undisciplined. They guess at requirements, pick arbitrary technical approaches, skip verification, and produce code that doesn't fit your architecture. Close the chat, and all that context is gone.\n\nI built Draft to fix this. It's a plugin for Claude Code (also works with Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Gemini) that forces structure into AI-assisted development.\n\nThe core idea: Context-Driven Development. Instead of letting the AI make autonomous decisions, Draft creates persistent markdown files that constrain what the AI can do.\n\nHow it works:\n\n1. \\`/draft:init\\` — Scans your codebase and generates product.md, tech-stack.md, architecture.md (with mermaid diagrams), and workflow.md. Pay the analysis cost once; every future task gets instant context.\n\n2. \\`/draft:new-track\\` — Collaborative spec creation. AI asks one question at a time, contributes expertise (patterns, risks, trade-offs from DDD, Clean Architecture, OWASP), and builds the spec progressively. You review the approach in a document, not a diff.\n\n3. \\`/draft:implement\\` — Executes one task at a time from the plan, follows TDD (Red → Green → Refactor), requires proof at every step. No more \"it should work\" without evidence.\n\n4. \\`/draft:validate\\` + \\`/draft:bughunt\\` + \\`/draft:coverage\\` — Architecture conformance, security scans, performance anti-patterns, exhaustive bug hunting across 12 dimensions, and 95%+ test coverage targeting.\n\nWhy this matters: you review the spec before any code is written. Disagreements are resolved by editing a paragraph, not rewriting a module. Close the session, reopen it — the context is in git-tracked files, not lost in chat history.\n\n13 slash commands covering the full lifecycle. Everything lives in your repo as markdown. Works for solo devs and teams.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/mayurpise/draft](https://github.com/mayurpise/draft)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the design decisions.",

We are paid for the outcomes, in some ways, but what we are really being paid for are the thousand decisions along the way.  Sure, the UI and UX are important decisions, but there are oh so many more.  LLMs are a poorly adapted technology for replacing this aspect of software development, because they fundamentally do not make decisions, they map probabilities that explore insanely high dimensional spaces.  They will do well at recreating things that exist, throwing together UIs that function, and software that satisfies whatever requirements the user can think to codify.  What they don't do is catch things you forgot, produce software that is higher quality than the norm, considering user journeys that create delightful experiences when customers least expect them, or code that is cheap to evolve and secure by default.\n\nDevelopers with good fundamentals can already use AI to build these things, but they're not doing it 10x as fast as they were before.  (In some cases, it's not clear that they're doing it faster than before at all, but may still be doing it with less cognitive burden and this more happily.). Vibe coders who don't know how to build secure software are going to (and are) launching insecure systems (look at the LLM botnets that are proliferating right now).  Vibe coders who haven't had to build an extensible system will find that they have to start from scratch when requirements change even a little.\n\nWill we find a middle ground? Absolutely. Will it be found by people who are today's \"vibe coders?\" No, it'll be found incrementally by the people who have the fundamentals to fill the gaps in the technology the way it always has.\n\nAI does not address the fundamental complexity of software:\n\n> there is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even one order of magnitude [tenfold] improvement within a decade in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity\n> - Fred Brooks\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet",

That's the blessing and the curse of *soft*ware: it's not as hard to change as *hard*ware, and people make use of that fact. So now you have to adapt your program to the changes of others, even if you didn't intend to change your software (but you probably did), just to keep it functioning on the next big Windows/macOS/Chrome/Android/... update.\n\nMiddle-schoolers could write a program that \"just works\" for ages. That's not the hard part. AI just made it lot faster (and to be fair, probably also better). The hard part is keeping a project alive and flexible over many years. And that's what we haven't figured out yet: if AI is capable to do so a sufficiently large project. I'm not saying it can't or never will, but so far there is no proof that it can, simply because not enough time has passed for any vibe-coded app to truly stand the test of time.",

And sometimes an attempt to layering another abstractions gets rejected when with time people find it unnecessary or costly or bad.\n\nAlternatively, people use these new abstractions but they don’t spread it everywhere, abstractions stay narrow-focused.\n\nLike for example – interpreted programming languages. Although proven useful but they don’t capture the entire programming field. OS still written in some C not JavaScript, because this interpretive concept has a price – JavaScript just poorly performant compared to C, same with other interpreted languages. So this new concept didn’t replace the entire programming field although it is trying but it will never take it all. Its concept is just too costly for certain areas.\n\nAbstractions is only good when it gives you more than it takes. And any abstraction always takes. So has to weight your costs and gains. And in some cases, yes, new abstractions make sense. In others don’t.\n\nAlso, abstraction does NOT equal another abstraction. This is Rust vs JavaScript comparison. Where Rust is an abstraction on C and but very efficient abstraction which makes quite powerful binary. So they’re both abstractions but different kinds of abstractions, very different costs.\n\nSo who knows, maybe some abstraction comes into place now but after a year or some time we will find a much better alternative abstraction?\n\n>Is vibe coding just another abstraction layer\n\nYes, it is. But it’s not like we have to adopt any abstraction we get just because «abstraction is the way to go anyway» – one abstraction does not equal to another, and you never know which form of those will actually live and prove more useful than others.",

The intent gap is tricky because AI doesn't leave breadcrumbs about why it made certain choices, so reviewers end up either rubber-stamping or doing archaeology on every function. One approach that's helped some teams is treating the spec itself as the review anchor.\n\nIf you can lock down what the AI is supposed to build upfront with clear acceptance criteria, then review becomes \"does this match the spec\" rather than \"is this code good.\" Still need to check for obvious issues, but it narrows the surface area. I came across Zencoder Zenflow a while back and it seems built specifically for this problem. The idea is spec-driven workflows that keep AI agents tethered to your engineering requirements with verification loops built in, so there's less drift between what you asked for and what got implemented.\n\nMight be worth a look if you're spending hours reconstructing intent during PR reviews. The test-only approach definitely feels risky like you said, especially for edge cases that aren't coverd yet.",

There is basically no product that is guaranteed to be better, and whatever is better now probably won't be next week.  Especially with the rapid advancement of open source tools.\n\n(It's not a Gemini product, but Cursor seems to be the most popular by far within my professional circle, and Claude Code seems to be the most popular in my hobby circles.  I would not fault anyone who is going for \"don't bet against Google long term\" though and keeping a toe in their ecosystem.)",
