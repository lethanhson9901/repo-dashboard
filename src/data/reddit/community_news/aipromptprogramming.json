      "text": "so these researchers at both MIT, Harvard and BCG ran a field study with 244 of BCG's actual consultants. not some lab experiment with college students. real consultants doing real work across junior mid and senior levels.\n\n\n\nthey found three completely different species of ai users emerging naturally. and one of them is basically a skill trap disguised as productivity.\n\n\n\ncentaurs - these people keep strategic control and hand off specific tasks to ai. like \"analyze this market data\" then they review and integrate. they upskilled in their actual domain expertise.\n\n\n\ncyborgs - these folks do this continuous dance with ai. write a paragraph let ai refine it edit the refinement prompt for alternatives repeat. they developed entirely new skills that didnt exist two years ago.\n\n\n\nself-automators - these people just... delegate everything. minimal judgment. pure handoff. and heres the kicker - zero skill development. actually negative. their abilities are eroding.\n\n\n\nthe why is kind of obvious once you see it. self-automators became observers not practitioners. when you just watch ai do the work you stop exercising teh muscle. cyborgs stayed in the loop so they built this weird hybrid problem solving ability. centaurs retained judgment so their domain expertise actually deepened.\n\n\n\nno special training on \"correct\" usage. just let consultants do their thing naturally and watched what happened.\n\n\n\nthe workflow that actually builds skills looks like this\n\n\n\n1. shoot the problem at ai to get initial direction\n\n2. dont just accept it - argue with the output\n\n3. ask why it made those choices\n\n4. use ai to poke holes in your thinking\n\n5. iterate back and forth like a sparring partner\n\n6. make the final call yourself\n\n\n\nthe thing most people miss is that a centaur using ai once per week might learn and produce more than a self-automator using it 40 hours per week. volume doesnt equal learning or impact. the mode of collaboration is everything.\n\n\n\nand theres a hidden risk nobody talks about. when systems fail... and they will, \n\nself automators cant recover. they delegated the skill away. its gone.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n",

And similarly cover the AI's weaknesses with your strengths.\n\nAI won't tend to question you much by default, but it's easy enough to tell it to!\n\nWorking this way, you actually gain a lot of skills and knowledge along the way.",

You don't have to write all the code, but you can't let it take over the project. You can't be the boss and treat it like a senior dev - at least not yet! And essentially if you don't have the skills to be the senior dev, it's only a matter of hours or days until you hit a wall with it.\n\nBut yeah one of the biggest uses of AI is essentially to help you ensure you don't miss anything - you can have a a goal with 2 or 3 ideas of how to approach it and what issues you might find... but AI will often be able to expand that and prevent you from wasting time on dead ends, etc.\n\nSo \"inexperienced with encyclopaedic knowledge\" is about right!",

They just give a nod that you are doing good while bitching about you need to improve a bit on people skills(play nice with low performers).\n\nI used to finish my assigned work in 30% of the allotted time and used to spend rest of the time to gold polish it in terms of making the code better along with unit tests. Less bugs for me to fix at the end and less paper work in terms of helping with documentations or presentations etc.\n\nIf you give me AI tool I may  be able to code myself out of the job but then I will get laid off. Why should I show everyone that the AI is a great tool to reduce head count if used properly since that means I myself will be on the chopping block.\n\nAlso, if 3 people of my team of 6 get laid off, the mofo management will switch teams around and I will end up with another team, having to figure out interpersonal shit again.",

      "text": "I've been impressed with \"Never Split the Difference\" and realized Chris Voss' negotiation techniques work incredibly well as AI prompts.\n\nIt's like turning AI into your personal FBI negotiator who knows how to get to yes without compromise:\n\n**1. \"How can I use calibrated questions to make them think it's their idea?\"**\n\nVoss' tactical empathy in action. AI designs questions that shift power dynamics. \"I need my boss to approve this budget. How can I use calibrated questions to make them think it's their idea?\" Gets you asking \"How am I supposed to do that?\" instead of arguing your position.\n\n**2. \"What would labeling their emotions sound like before I make my request?\"**\n\nHis mirroring and labeling technique as a prompt. Perfect for defusing tension. \"My client is angry about the delay. What would labeling their emotions sound like before I make my request?\" AI scripts the \"It seems like you're frustrated that...\" approach that disarms resistance.\n\n**3. \"How do I get them to say 'That's right' instead of just 'You're right'?\"**\n\nVoss' distinction between agreement and real buy-in. \"I keep getting 'yes' but then people don't follow through. How do I get them to say 'That's right' instead of just 'You're right'?\" Teaches the difference between compliance and genuine alignment.\n\n**4. \"What's the accusation audit I should run before this difficult conversation?\"**\n\nHis preemptive tactical empathy. AI helps you disarm objections before they surface. \"I'm about to ask for a raise. What's the accusation audit I should run before this difficult conversation?\" Gets you listing every negative thing they might think, then addressing it upfront.\n\n**5. \"How can I use 'No' to make them feel safe and in control?\"**\n\nVoss' counterintuitive approach to rejection. \"I'm trying to close this sale but they're hesitant. How can I use 'No' to make them feel safe and in control?\" AI designs questions like \"Is now a bad time?\" that paradoxically increase engagement.\n\n**6. \"What would the Ackerman Model look like for this negotiation?\"**\n\nHis systematic bargaining framework as a prompt. \"I'm negotiating salary and don't want to anchor wrong. What would the Ackerman Model look like for this negotiation?\" Gets you the 65-85-95-100 increment approach that FBI agents use.\n\n**The Voss insight:** Negotiations aren't about logic and compromise—they're about tactical empathy and understanding human psychology. AI helps you script these high-stakes conversations like a professional.\n\n**Advanced technique:** Layer his tactics like he does with hostage takers. \"Label their emotions. Ask calibrated questions. Get 'that's right.' Run accusation audit. Use 'no' strategically. Apply Ackerman model.\" Creates comprehensive negotiation architecture.\n\n**Secret weapon:** Add \"script this like Chris Voss would negotiate it\" to any difficult conversation prompt. AI applies tactical empathy, mirrors, labels, and calibrated questions automatically.\n\nI've been using these for everything from job offers to family conflicts. It's like having an FBI negotiator in your pocket who knows that whoever is more willing to walk away has leverage.\n\n**Voss bomb:** Use AI to identify your negotiation blind spots. \"What assumptions am I making about this negotiation that are weakening my position?\" Reveals where you're negotiating against yourself.\n\n**The late-night FM DJ voice:** \"How should I modulate my tone and pacing in this conversation to create a calming effect?\" Applies his famous downward inflection technique that de-escalates tension.\n\n**Mirroring script:** \"They just said [statement]. What's the mirror response that gets them to elaborate?\" Practices his 1-3 word repetition technique that makes people explain themselves.\n\n**Reality check:** Voss' tactics work because they're genuinely empathetic, not manipulative. Add \"while maintaining authentic connection and mutual respect\" to ensure you're not just using people.\n\n**Pro insight:** Voss says \"No\" is the start of negotiation, not the end. Ask AI: \"They said no to my proposal. What calibrated questions help me understand their real objection?\" Turns rejection into information gathering.\n\n**Calibrated question generator:** \"I want to influence [person] to [outcome]. Give me 5 'how' or 'what' questions that give them illusion of control while guiding the conversation.\" Operationalizes his most powerful tactic.\n\n**The 7-38-55 rule:** \"In this negotiation, what should my actual words convey versus my tone versus my body language to maximize trust?\" Applies communication research to high-stakes moments.\n\n**Black Swan discovery:** \"What unknown unknowns (Black Swans) might exist in this negotiation that would change everything if I discovered them?\" Uses his concept of game-changing hidden information.\n\n**Fair warning:** \"How do I use the word 'fair' offensively to reset the conversation when they're being unreasonable?\" Weaponizes the F-word of negotiation ethically.\n\n**Summary label technique:** \"Summarize what they've told me in a way that gets them to say 'That's right' and feel deeply understood.\" Creates the breakthrough moment Voss identifies as true agreement.\n\n**Bending reality:** \"What would an extreme anchor look like here that makes my real ask seem reasonable by comparison?\" Uses his strategic anchoring principle without being absurd.\n\n**The \"How am I supposed to do that?\" weapon:** \"When they make an unreasonable demand, how do I ask 'How am I supposed to do that?' in a way that makes them solve my problem?\" Turns their position into your leverage.\n\nIf you are keen, you can explore our free, well categorized meta AI [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/all-prompt-categories/).",

      "text": "I've spent the last few months reverse-engineering how top performers use AI. Collected techniques from forums, Discord servers, and LinkedIn deep-dives. Most were overhyped, but these 7 patterns consistently produced outputs that made my old prompts look like amateur hour:\n\n**1. \"Give me the worst possible version first\"**\n\nCounterintuitive but brilliant. AI shows you what NOT to do, then you understand quality by contrast.\n\n> \"Write a cold email for my service. Give me the worst possible version first, then the best.\"\n\nYou learn what makes emails terrible (desperation, jargon, wall of text) by seeing it explicitly. Then the good version hits harder because you understand the gap.\n\n**2. \"You have unlimited time and resources—what's your ideal approach?\"**\n\nRemoves AI's bias toward \"practical\" answers. You get the dream solution, then scale it back yourself.\n\n> \"I need to learn Python. You have unlimited time and resources—what's your ideal approach?\"\n\nAI stops giving you the rushed 30-day bootcamp and shows you the actual comprehensive path. Then YOU decide what to cut based on real constraints.\n\n**3. \"Compare your answer to how [2 different experts] would approach this\"**\n\nMulti-perspective analysis without multiple prompts.\n\n> \"Suggest a content strategy. Then compare your answer to how Gary Vee and Seth Godin would each approach this differently.\"\n\nYou get three schools of thought in one response. The comparison reveals assumptions and trade-offs you'd miss otherwise.\n\n**4. \"Identify what I'm NOT asking but probably should be\"**\n\nThe blind-spot finder. AI catches the adjacent questions you overlooked.\n\n> \"I want to start freelancing. Identify what I'm NOT asking but probably should be.\"\n\nSuddenly you're thinking about contracts, pricing models, client red flags, stuff that wasn't on your radar but absolutely matters.\n\n**5. \"Break this into a 5-step process, then tell me which step people usually mess up\"**\n\nStructure + failure prediction = actual preparation.\n\n> \"Break 'launching a newsletter' into a 5-step process, then tell me which step people usually mess up.\"\n\nYou get a roadmap AND the common pitfalls highlighted before you hit them. Way more valuable than generic how-to lists.\n\n**6. \"Challenge your own answer, what's the strongest counter-argument?\"**\n\nBuilt-in fact-checking. AI plays devil's advocate against itself.\n\n> \"Should I quit my job to start a business? Challenge your own answer, what's the strongest counter-argument?\"\n\nForces balanced thinking instead of confirmation bias. You see both sides argued well, then decide from informed ground.\n\n**7. \"If you could only give me ONE action to take right now, what would it be?\"**\n\nCuts through analysis paralysis with surgical precision.\n\n> \"I want to improve my writing. If you could only give me ONE action to take right now, what would it be?\"\n\nNo 10-step plans, no overwhelming roadmaps. Just the highest-leverage move. Then you can ask for the next one after you complete it.\n\nThe pattern I've noticed: **the best prompts don't just ask for answers, but they ask for thinking systems.**\n\nYou can chain these together for serious depth:\n\n> \"Break learning SQL into 5 steps and tell me which one people mess up. Then give me the ONE action to take right now. Before you answer, identify what I'm NOT asking but should be.\"\n\n**The mistake I see everywhere:** Treating AI like a search engine instead of a thinking partner. It's not about finding information, but about processing it in ways you hadn't considered.\n\n**What actually changed for me:** The \"what am I NOT asking\" prompt. It's like having someone who thinks about your problem sideways while you're stuck thinking forward. Found gaps in project plans, business ideas, even personal decisions I would've completely missed.\n\n**Fair warning:** These work best when you already have some direction. If you're totally lost, start simpler. Complexity is a tool, not a crutch.\n\nIf you are keen, you can explore our free, tips, tricks and well categorized mega AI [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nAt the beginning of **2024**, we were working as a service company for enterprise customers with a very concrete request:  \nautomate **incoming emails → contract updates → ERP systems**.\n\nThe first versions worked.  \nThen, over time, they quietly stopped working.\n\nAnd not just because of new edge cases or creative wording.\n\nEmails we had already processed correctly started failing again.  \nThe *same* supplier messages produced different outputs weeks later.  \nMinor prompt edits broke unrelated extraction logic.  \nModel updates changed behavior without any visible signal.  \nAnd business rules ended up split across prompts, workflows, and human memory.\n\nIn an ERP context, this is unacceptable — you don’t get partial credit for “mostly correct”.\n\nWe looked for existing tools that could stabilize AI logic under these conditions. We didn’t find any that handled:\n\n* regression against **previously working inputs**\n* controlled evolution of prompts\n* decoupling AI logic from automation workflows\n* explainability when something changes\n\nSo we did what we knew from software engineering and automation work:  \nwe treated prompts as **business logic**, and built a continuous development, testing, and deployment framework around them.\n\nThat meant:\n\n* versioned prompts\n* explicit output schemas\n* regression tests against *historical inputs*\n* model upgrades treated as migrations, not surprises\n* and releases that were blocked unless everything still worked\n\nBy late **2024**, this approach allowed us to reliably extract contract updates from unstructured emails from over 100 suppliers into ERP systems with **100% signal accuracy.**\n\nOur product is now deployed across multiple enterprises in **2025**.  \nWe’re sharing it as **open source** because this problem isn’t unique to us — it’s what happens when LLMs leave experiments and enter real workflows.\n\nYou can think of it like **cursor for prompts** \\+ **GitHub** \\+ **Execution and Integration Environment**\n\nThe mental model that finally clicked for us wasn’t “prompt engineering”, but **prompt = code**.\n\n# Patterns that actually mattered for us\n\nThese weren’t theoretical ideas — they came from production failures:\n\n* **Narrow surface decomposition** One prompt = one signal. No “do everything” prompts. Boolean / scalar outputs instead of free text.\n* **Test before production (always)** If behavior isn’t testable, it doesn’t ship. No runtime magic, no self-healing agents.\n* **Decouple AI logic from workflows** Prompts don’t live inside n8n / agents / app code. Workflows call *versioned prompt releases*.\n* **Model changes are migrations, not surprises** New model → rerun regressions offline → commit or reject.\n\nThis approach is already running in several enterprise deployments.  \nOne example: extracting business signals from incoming emails into ERP systems with **100% signal accuracy** at the indicator level (not “pretty text”, but actual machine-actionable flags).\n\n# What Genum is (and isn’t)\n\n* Open source (on-prem)\n* Free to use (SaaS optional, lifetime free tier)\n* Includes a small $5 credit for major model providers so testing isn’t hypothetical\n* Not a prompt playground\n* Not an agent framework\n* Not runtime policy enforcement\n\nIt’s infrastructure for **making AI behavior boring and reliable**.\n\nIf you’re:\n\n* shipping LLMs inside real systems\n* maintaining business automations\n* trying to separate experimental AI from production logic\n* tired of prompts behaving like vibes instead of software\n\nwe’d genuinely love feedback — especially critical feedback.\n\n**Links (if you want to dig in):**\n\n* Repo: [https://github.com/genumai/](https://github.com/genumai/genum)\n* Docs: [https://docs.genum.ai](https://docs.genum.ai)\n* Website: [https://genum.ai](https://genum.ai/)\n* YouTube (patterns & deep dives): [https://www.youtube.com/@Genum-ai](https://www.youtube.com/@Genum-ai)\n* We are looking for advisors: [https://cdn.genum.ai/docs/advisor\\_pitch.pdf](https://cdn.genum.ai/docs/advisor_pitch.pdf)\n\nWe’re not here to sell anything — this exists because we needed it ourselves.  \nHappy to answer questions, debate assumptions, or collaborate with people who are actually running this stuff in production.\n\n[genum](https://i.redd.it/7km85evzcadg1.gif)\n\n— The Genum team",

      "text": "There are prompting techniques borrowed from engineering, philosophy, and creative fields that most people don't know exist.\n\nI started using them a few months ago and my outputs completely changed.\n\nHere are 5 techniques that will change how you prompt:\n\n**1.⁠ ⁠Reverse Prompting :**\n\nMost people write: \"Write a marketing email for my product launch.\"\n\nThe result feels like every other marketing email.\n\nReverse prompting flips this:\n\nShow the AI a finished example and ask:\n\n\"What prompt would generate content exactly like this?\"\n\nEngineers do this with software, hardware, even competitor products.\n\nWhy it works for prompts: AI models are pattern recognition machines.\n\nWhen you show them finished work, they can reverse engineer the hidden structure tone, pacing, depth, formatting, emotional intention.\n\nTry it:\n\nFind an email, article, or post you love. Paste it in, then ask:\n\n\"Analyze this text. What prompt would generate content with this exact style, structure, and tone? Give me the prompt.\"\n\nNow you have a template that works every time.\n\n**2.⁠ ⁠Inversion (Charlie Munger's \"Anti-Goal\" Method)**\n\nMost people ask: \"How do I achieve X?\"\n\nInversion asks: \"What would guarantee I fail at X?\"\n\nWhere it comes from: This is a core mental model used by Warren Buffett's partner Charlie Munger.\n\nHe famously said: \"Tell me where I'm going to die so I never go there.\"\n\nInstead of chasing success, avoid failure.\n\nWhy it works for prompts: AI is surprisingly good at identifying what breaks, what fails, what goes wrong.\n\nMap the disasters, and you've mapped the path forward.\n\nTry it: Instead of:\n\n\"Help me set goals for 2026\" Use: \"What are 10 ways I could guarantee 2026 becomes my worst year? Be specific about the habits, decisions, and situations that would destroy my progress.\"\n\nThen you just invert the list. What you avoid becomes what you pursue.\n\n**3.⁠ ⁠Constraint-Based Thinking (Force Precision)**\n\nMost people give AI complete freedom. That's why everything sounds the same.\n\nWhere it comes from: This comes from creative fields poetry, architecture, game design. Twitter had 140 characters.\n\nConstraints don't limit creativity they force it.\n\nWhy it works for prompts:\n\nConstraints kill fluff.\n\nThe AI stops pattern matching generic responses and starts problem solving within boundaries.\n\nTry it:\n\nInstead of:\n\n\"Write a product description\"\n\nUse: \"Write a product description in exactly 50 words. Include the word 'friction.' Do not use: innovative, solution, cutting-edge, seamless, or revolutionary.\"\n\n**4.⁠ ⁠Socratic Method (Question Chains)**\n\nMost people ask one question. Get one answer. Stop. Socratic method keeps digging.\n\nWhere it comes from: Named after the Greek philosopher Socrates, who taught by asking successive questions that led students to discover answers themselves.\n\nEach question built on the last, revealing deeper truth. Why it works for prompts:\n\nEach answer builds context. The AI gets smarter as the conversation progresses.\n\nBy question 4, you're miles beyond where a single prompt could take you.\n\nTry it: \"What makes someone buy a SaaS product?\" → \"Which factor matters most for small business owners?\" → \"What objection kills the sale most often?\" → \"Write email copy that addresses that specific objection for \\[my product\\].\"\n\n**5.⁠ ⁠First Principles Thinking (Break the Pattern)**\n\nMost people accept surface-level answers.\n\nFirst principles tears everything down to fundamental truths.\n\nWhere it comes from: This is how Elon Musk approaches problems.\n\nAristotle called it \"reasoning from first principles\" breaking things down to their most basic truths and reasoning up from there, rather than reasoning by analogy.\n\nWhy it works for prompts: Forces AI to reason from scratch instead of regurgitating common patterns it's seen a thousand times.\n\nTry it: Instead of: \"What's good SEO?\"\n\nUse: \"Forget all SEO advice.\n\nFrom first principles only:\n\nwhat is Google's core business model?\n\nWhat must they prioritize to stay profitable?\n\nBased only on that, what would make them rank a page higher?\"\n\nAt their core, mental models are timeless.\n\nThey've worked for decades in business, science, and philosophy.\n\nIf you want more thinking tools and prompts examples like this,\n\nFeel free to check out : [Thinking  Tools](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qbnaok)",

I’m on ChatGPT Plus, and mostly use it for general topics, rewriting emails, and research. I use it with\n\n[Manus](https://manus.im/) \\- For researching complex, repetitive stuff. I usually run Manus and ChatGPT side by side and then compare the results, consolidate insights from them\n\n[Granola](https://www.granola.ai/) \\- An AI note taker that doesn’t have a bot. I just let it run in the background when I’m listening in. The summaries are quite solid too\n\n[Saner](https://www.saner.ai/) \\- Helps manage notes, todos, calendars via chat. Useful since ChatGPT doesn’t have a workspace interface yet.\n\n[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) \\- Good for long PDFs. It handles this better than ChatGPT in my pov. I also like the diagram, podcast thing - sometimes it makes dense material easier to digest.\n\nTell me your recs! what do you use with AI models to cover your whole workflow?",

The hand as others mention ofc, but the back of her right knee reads too much like a knee to me. Between hand, that leg, and her outfit, it’s very hard to establish correct gesture of the body, which I imagine enhances a certain sense or wrongness/distortion with the grip\n\nThat said, again I don’t think anyone would notice. And I really don’t intend to be mean, but I don’t think anyone would notice, because the imagery is too bland to catch the eye. It feels like imagery to ignore.\n\nI get this is a small dollar spot, and your margins are thin, but if I was the client I’d probably pay for this one, but never return. Not because it’s *bad,* but because it’s bland. \n\nSince you’re using AI, is there any reason not to create images fir this that you would have wanted to given a fat budget for production? Seems like a key opportunity here is not to just produce a market ready image, but one that exploits the full range of capabilities of the toolset at your fingertips\n\nThis could be client direction, idk. I’d still pop an alt that sparkled tho, bandwidth permitting \n\nFrom a brand perspective, is the client comfortable with AI produced imagery? There’s definitely enough backlash in market that you’d want clear buy off. \nI’m assuming Huel isn’t the actual client, but fpo, otherwise it’s a lot more likely to emerge as an issue if the images hit the market",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’m excited to share something we’ve been building for the past 6 months, a **fully open-source Enterprise Search Platform** designed to bring powerful Enterprise Search to every team, without vendor lock-in. The platform brings all your business data together and makes it searchable. It connects with apps like Google Drive, Gmail, Slack, Notion, Confluence, Jira, Outlook, SharePoint, Dropbox, Local file uploads and more. You can deploy it and run it with just one docker compose command.\n\nYou can run the full platform locally. Recently, one of our users tried **qwen3-vl:8b (16 FP)** with **vLLM** and got very good results.\n\nThe entire system is built on a **fully event-streaming architecture powered by Kafka**, making indexing and retrieval scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-time across large volumes of data.\n\nAt the core, the system uses an **Agentic Multimodal RAG approach**, where retrieval is guided by an enterprise knowledge graph and reasoning agents. Instead of treating documents as flat text, agents reason over relationships between users, teams, entities, documents, and permissions, allowing more accurate, explainable, and permission-aware answers.\n\n**Key features**\n\n* Deep understanding of user, organization and teams with enterprise knowledge graph\n* Connect to any AI model of your choice including OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, or Ollama\n* Use any provider that supports OpenAI compatible endpoints\n* Choose from 1,000+ embedding models\n* Visual Citations for every answer\n* Vision-Language Models and OCR for visual or scanned docs\n* Login with Google, Microsoft, OAuth, or SSO\n* Rich REST APIs for developers\n* All major file types support including pdfs with images, diagrams and charts\n* Agent Builder - Perform actions like Sending mails, Schedule Meetings, etc along with Search, Deep research, Internet search and more\n* Reasoning Agent that plans before executing tasks\n* 40+ Connectors allowing you to connect to your entire business apps\n\nCheck it out and share your thoughts or feedback. Your feedback is immensely valuable and is much appreciated:  \n[https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai](https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai)\n\nDemo Video:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9m3pwOgz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9m3pwOgz8)",
