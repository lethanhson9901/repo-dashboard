      "text": "so these researchers at both MIT, Harvard and BCG ran a field study with 244 of BCG's actual consultants. not some lab experiment with college students. real consultants doing real work across junior mid and senior levels.\n\n\n\nthey found three completely different species of ai users emerging naturally. and one of them is basically a skill trap disguised as productivity.\n\n\n\ncentaurs - these people keep strategic control and hand off specific tasks to ai. like \"analyze this market data\" then they review and integrate. they upskilled in their actual domain expertise.\n\n\n\ncyborgs - these folks do this continuous dance with ai. write a paragraph let ai refine it edit the refinement prompt for alternatives repeat. they developed entirely new skills that didnt exist two years ago.\n\n\n\nself-automators - these people just... delegate everything. minimal judgment. pure handoff. and heres the kicker - zero skill development. actually negative. their abilities are eroding.\n\n\n\nthe why is kind of obvious once you see it. self-automators became observers not practitioners. when you just watch ai do the work you stop exercising teh muscle. cyborgs stayed in the loop so they built this weird hybrid problem solving ability. centaurs retained judgment so their domain expertise actually deepened.\n\n\n\nno special training on \"correct\" usage. just let consultants do their thing naturally and watched what happened.\n\n\n\nthe workflow that actually builds skills looks like this\n\n\n\n1. shoot the problem at ai to get initial direction\n\n2. dont just accept it - argue with the output\n\n3. ask why it made those choices\n\n4. use ai to poke holes in your thinking\n\n5. iterate back and forth like a sparring partner\n\n6. make the final call yourself\n\n\n\nthe thing most people miss is that a centaur using ai once per week might learn and produce more than a self-automator using it 40 hours per week. volume doesnt equal learning or impact. the mode of collaboration is everything.\n\n\n\nand theres a hidden risk nobody talks about. when systems fail... and they will, \n\nself automators cant recover. they delegated the skill away. its gone.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n",

You don't have to write all the code, but you can't let it take over the project. You can't be the boss and treat it like a senior dev - at least not yet! And essentially if you don't have the skills to be the senior dev, it's only a matter of hours or days until you hit a wall with it.\n\nBut yeah one of the biggest uses of AI is essentially to help you ensure you don't miss anything - you can have a a goal with 2 or 3 ideas of how to approach it and what issues you might find... but AI will often be able to expand that and prevent you from wasting time on dead ends, etc.\n\nSo \"inexperienced with encyclopaedic knowledge\" is about right!",

I just give it instructions in chat window, when I know that the problem is easy but will take me an hour to type 40-50 lines of code for that method. So far results are amazing, AI is very good at taking instructions and write good code if the problem is well defined.\n\nIMO, productivity goes up by 100% if you know what you are doing and know the limitations of current AI tools.\n\ncc u/FabulousLazarus",

Feed in a feature request or idea\n2. Get back\n   * a clear spec\n   * edge cases\n   * test cases\n   * and a rough implementation plan\n\nIn my head that sounded beautiful. In reality, my first version did this:\n\n* turned 2 line prompts into 1.5k word essays\n* mixed requirements with marketing fluff\n* forgot edge cases like it had memory issues\n* sometimes changed the actual feature halfway through\n\nAt one point my own “requirements agent” suggested a completely different feature than the one in the input. It was like working with a junior dev who is smart but permanently distracted.\n\nThat hurt my ego enough that I did something I should have done much earlier:\n\nI started treating prompts like code instead of wishes.\n\n# What I actually changed\n\n**1. Wrote them like functions, not paragraphs**\n\nInstead of:\n\n>\n\nI rewrote it as something closer to a function signature:\n\n>\n\nSuddenly the output looked structured enough that I could pipe it into the next step.\n\n**2. Added pre conditions**\n\nMy old prompts assumed the model magically “gets it”.\n\nNow I use things like:\n\n>\n\nThis alone killed a lot of “good looking but wrong” answers.\n\n**3. Forced a thinking phase**\n\nI stole this from how we plan code:\n\n>\n\nIn tools that allow it, I log that internal plan to see where it goes off the rails. It is amazing how many weird jumps you can fix just by tightening that stage.\n\n**4. Gave each agent a strong personality**\n\nNot “you are a helpful assistant”.\n\nMore like:\n\n>\n\nThen you do a different persona for QA, product, copy etc. The tone shift is real.\n\n**5. Treated bad outputs like failing tests, not “AI is dumb” moments**\n\nThe old me: “ugh, GPT is getting worse”\n\nThe new me:\n\n* Copy the bad output\n* Highlight exactly what broke\n* Patch the prompt with something like “If you are about to \\[bad behavior\\], stop and ask for clarification instead”\n* Re run and see if it passes\n\nIt feels a lot more like normal dev work and a lot less like random magic.\n\n# What changed in practice\n\n* My “pair programming” experience stopped oscillating between amazing and unusable\n* The same base prompts work across different models\n* I can chain things without everything collapsing on step 3\n* When something fails, I usually know where to look first\n\nIt is still not perfect, obviously. But now when something feels off, I do not instantly blame the model. I check the prompt design first.\n\nIf anyone is interested, I have been collecting these small prompt patterns and frameworks I actually use in my own workflow. Not just single copy paste lines, more like reusable building blocks.\n\nI dropped a bunch of them here if you want to steal or remix them:  \n[https://allneedshere.blog/prompt-pack.html](https://allneedshere.blog/prompt-pack.html)\n\nAlso curious how others here treat prompts.  \nDo you version them like code, keep a library, use tests, or just vibe it out in the chat window?",

Stop self-prompting. Use AI to prompt AI.\n\nSeriously. **Never raw-prompt if you care about results.**  \nHave one AI help you design the prompt for another. You’ll instantly get clearer outputs, fewer hallucinations, and less wasted time. If this just clicked for you, you’re welcome.\n\n# 2. How you end a prompt matters more than you think.\n\nMost people ramble and then just… hit enter.\n\nTry ending *every* serious prompt with something like:\n\n>Don’t be wrong. Be useful. No bullshit. Get it right.\n\nIt sounds dumb. It works anyway.\n\n# 3. Context framing is everything.\n\nAI responses change massively based on *who it thinks you are* and *why you’re asking*.\n\nFraming questions from a professional or problem-solving perspective (developer, admin, researcher, moderator, etc.) consistently produces better, more technical, more actionable answers than vague curiosity ever will.\n\nYou’re not “asking a random question.”  \nYou’re **solving a problem**.\n\n# 4. Iteration beats brute force.\n\nOne giant prompt is worse than a sequence of smaller, deliberate ones.\n\nAsk → refine → narrow → clarify intent → request specifics.  \nMost people quit after the first reply. That’s why they think AI “isn’t that smart.”\n\nIt is. You’re just lazy.\n\n# 5. Configure the AI before you even start.\n\nAlmost nobody does this, which is wild.\n\nGo into the settings:\n\n* Set rules\n* Define preferences\n* Lock in tone and expectations\n* Use memory where available\n\nBonus tip: **have an AI help you write those rules and system instructions**. Let it optimize itself *for you*.\n\nThat’s it. No magic. No mysticism. Just actually using the tool instead of poking it and hoping.\n\nIf you’re treating AI like a toy, you’ll get toy answers.  \nIf you treat it like an instrument, it’ll act like one.\n\nUse it properly or don’t, less competition either way.",

After several iterations, this is how the clarification gate is worded now:\n\n\"HARD GATE 1 — CLARITY GATE (must run before every answer)\n- Before producing any solution, commands, configuration changes, or “best guess” diagnosis:\n  - Decide if the request is clear enough to act on safely and correctly.\n  - If any part is unclear/ambiguous/underspecified OR could lead to risky actions:\n    - Ask targeted clarifying questions only.\n    - Request the minimum exact logs/outputs needed.\n    - STOP. Do not give fixes yet.\n- Only proceed if the user’s goal is explicit, constraints are known, and enough evidence/context exists.\"\n\nIt now often decides when it has all the variables figured to give a proper answer based on my request. The request logs part makes it ask for what is specifically written in any error logs or whatnot which helps it narrow down issues. \nNow it feels much more like a technician that tries to help me achieve my goals.",

A lot of tools now let you fine-tune on a single person with around 15 photos and then generate images via prompts, but the quality still seems highly dependent on how you structure those prompts and what base style you choose. Some products like [Looktara](http://looktara.com) say they handle the model training and style presets under the hood so you just describe the scene “me in a navy blazer, soft studio lighting, neutral background” and it produces a consistent, ultra-real image of the same person every time. For those of you who care about prompt design: what words or structures have given you the most reliable, professional-looking AI headshots, and how do you avoid prompts that push the model toward “beautify mode” and fake-looking results?",

      "text": "I’ve always found making slides to be a tedious part of my workflow. Whether it was for work presentations, teaching, or sharing projects, turning raw content into engaging slides took hours. Plus, pulling info from different sources like PDFs, docs, or videos and trying to condense that into something coherent was a pain. Recently, I stumbled on a tool called chatslide that made the process surprisingly smooth. What really caught my attention was its ability to pull content directly from PDFs, YouTube videos, web links, and docs, then automatically generate slide decks. It even lets you add scripts to those slides, and it can generate video presentations from them.What’s cool is that it’s not about replacing the creative process but automating the grunt work so you can focus on refining the message or delivery. I tried feeding it a technical whitepaper PDF, added some script notes, and within minutes I had a draft deck ready to customize—definitely saved me a ton of time.  \n  \nWould love to hear how others handle slide creation or if you’ve found any neat prompt hacks or pipelines to streamline this part of the workflow!",

Type another detailed prompt with corrections  \n  \nThe thing that kills me is:   \nAI is supposed to save time, but I'm spending 5-10 minutes per task just formulating prompts.  \n  \nAnd it's not just about typing speed - it's the mental overhead. I have to context-switch from \"developer mode\" to \"prompt engineer mode.\" I need to think about:  \n\\- How to phrase this clearly  \n\\- What context to include  \n\\- Whether to break it into steps  \n\\- How to structure the request  \n  \nBy the time I've crafted the perfect prompt, I sometimes think \"I could have just coded this myself in the same amount of time.\"  \n  \nThe worst part?  \n I can't just   \ntalk  \n through the problem like I would with a colleague. Voice transcription isn't really an option because raw speech-to-text produces messy, rambling text that the AI struggles with. So I'm stuck typing.  \n  \nAnyone else experiencing this?

I don't know what to call it.\n\nI actually just started using git worktree a few months ago too for the same reason - trying to run multiple agents on the same project without them stepping on each other. But honestly it just adds MORE overhead because now I'm orchestrating multiple agents AND trying to keep my notebook in sync with what they're all doing.\n\nThanks for the [micwrite.com](http://micwrite.com) tip btw, gonna check that out. But even with that, I don't think it's just about cleaning up the filler words, you know?\n\nLike when I'm thinking out loud, I'm literally thinking - \"okay so we need to do X... wait actually no let me rethink this... the function should handle Y but also what about edge case Z...\" That's not just messy, it's a completely different structure than what the AI wants, which is more like \"Create function. Requirements: 1, 2, 3. Edge cases: A, B, C.\"\n\nMy brain just doesn't naturally produce that format when I'm speaking.\n\nSo I'm curious - with your Windsurf setup, have you found any kind of mental model that helps you go straight from thinking mode to formatted prompt mode? Or is it always that translation step?\n\n(Also the irony of paying for AI tools to save time while also needing MORE tools just to manage the AI tools is really something lol)",

Oi...\n\nWhat I do is keep a separate chat going in perplexity or chatgpt projects - here I've got a few different \"meta prompts\" for prompt optimization.   Mostly so I don't eat into my precious credits in the ide.\n\nThe process I follow for setting these up is to to focus on a domain like coding, and then simply extract improvement instructions from the gpt 5 prompt cookbook and other best practices.   \n\nThe metaprompt rewrites my initial prompt in 2 phases. \n\nI have a very rough input template where I specify the category (code fix, architecture, analysis and code review, new feature)\n\n1) review my prompt, break down the task if it's complex into the \"atomic\" pieces and ask 1-3 clarifying questions about my immediate goal and or any noted inconsistencies.   At this point a skeleton is proposed for feedback as well.\n2) After I give my feedback a refined prompt is returned which also uses the correct syntax and structure. \n\nI've also set this up in kilocode, which has the benefit of being able to search my repo and reference the project docs.\n\nNotebookLM is a good place to dump the prompting guides that you find helpful.  I use that to extract different ideas.     \n\nIt still takes time, but once I'm in the groove it's not so bad.   In the end it still takes less time to just do it right.   Take the opportunity to think about what you're really trying to accomplish (dev brain) and let the ai handle the formatting and tools.  \n\nI strongly recommend the context engineering GitHub.   Take a look at the understanding / reasoning / verification examples under cognitive templates.   These are highly effective as a 2-3 step \"program\".",

      "text": "This last year has been hell of a journey, I've had 8 days off this year and worked 18 hour stints for most of them, wiggling LLMs into bigger and smaller context windows with an obsessive commitment to finish projects and improve their output and efficiency.\n\nI'm a senior coder with about 15 years in the industry, working on various programming languages as the technology rolled over and ending up on fullstack\n\nMCP tooling is now a little more than a year old, and I was one of the early adopters, after a few in-house tool iterations in January and Febuary which included browser and remote repl tooling, ssh tooling, mcp clients and some other things, I published some no-nonsense tooling that very drastically changed my daily programming life: mcp-repl (now mcp-glootie)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxnr0ovvgqbg1.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=3df4e2d0d36039ef5aaab5e6f7b1029991ddb9c2\n\n[https://github.com/AnEntrypoint/mcp-glootie](https://github.com/AnEntrypoint/mcp-glootie)\n\nOver the course of the next 6 months a lot of time was poured into benchmarking it (glm claude code, 4 agents with tooling enabled, 4 agents without) and refining it. That was a very fun experiment, making agents edit boilerplates and then getting an agent to comment on it. **testrunner.js** expresses my last used version of this.\n\nA lot of interesting ideas accumulated during that time, and glootie was given ast tooling. This was later removed and changed into a single-shot output. It was the second public tool called **thorns**. It was given the npx name **mcp-thorns** even though its not actually an MCP tool, it just runs.\n\nThings were looking pretty good. The agents were making less errors, there was still huge gaps in codebase understanding, and I was getting tons of repeated code everywhere. So I started experimenting with giving the LLM ast insight. First it was mcp tools, but the tool instruction bloat had a negative impact on productivity. Eventually it became simple cli tooling.\n\n**Enter Thorns:**[https://github.com/AnEntrypoint/mcp-thorns](https://github.com/AnEntrypoint/mcp-thorns)\n\nThe purpose of thorns is to output a one-shot view that most LLM's can understand and act on when making architectural improvements and cleaning up. Telling an agent to do `npx -y mcp-thorns@latest` gives an output like this:\n\n[https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lanmower/ba2ab9d85f473f65f89c21ede1276220](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lanmower/ba2ab9d85f473f65f89c21ede1276220)\n\nThis accelerated work by providing a mechanism the LLM could call to get codebase insight. Soon afterwards I came across a project called **WFGY** on reddit which was very interesting. I didnt fully understand how the prompt was created, but I started using it for a lot of things. As soon as claude code plugins were released, experimentation started on combining WFGY, thorns, and glootie into a bundle. That's when **glootie-cc** was born.\n\n[https://github.com/AnEntrypoint/glootie-cc](https://github.com/AnEntrypoint/glootie-cc)\n\nThis is my in-house productivity experiment. It combined glootie for code execution, thorns for code overview, and WFGY all into an easy to install package. I was quickly realising tooling was difficult to get working but definitely worth making.\n\nAs october and november rolled over I started refining my use of **playwright** for automated testing. Playwright became my glootie-for-the-browser (now replaced by playwriter which executes code more often). It could execute code if coaxed into it, allowing me to hook most parts of the projects state into globals for easy inspection. Allowing the LLM to debug the server and the client by running chunks of code while browsing is really useful. Most of the challenge being getting the agent to actually do both things and create the globals. This is when work completeness issues became completely obvious to me.\n\nAs productionlining increased, working with LLM's that quickly write pointless boilerplate code, then start adding to it ad nauseum and end up with software that makes little sense from a structural perspective and contained all sorts of dead code it no longer needed, prompting a few more updates to thorns and some further ideas towards prompting completeness into the behavior of the model.\n\nOver November and December, having just a little free time to experiment and do research yielded some super interesting results. I started experimenting with **ralph wiggum loops**. Those were interesting, but had issues with alignment and diversity, as well as any real understanding of whether its task is done or not.\n\n**Plan mode** has become such a big deal. I realised plan mode is now a tool the LLM can call. You can tell it \"use the plan tool to x\" and it will prompt itself to plan. **Subagents/Tasks** has also become a pretty big deal. I've designed my own subagent that further reinforces my preferences called **APEX**:\n\n[https://github.com/AnEntrypoint/glootie-cc/blob/master/agents/apex.md](https://github.com/AnEntrypoint/glootie-cc/blob/master/agents/apex.md)\n\nIn APEX all of the system policies are enforced in the latent space\n\nAfter cumulative comfort and understanding with WFGY, I decided to start trying AI conversations to manipulate the behavior of WFGY to be more suitable for coding agents. I made a customized version of it here:\n\n[https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lanmower/cb23dfe2ed9aa9795a80124d9eabb828](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lanmower/cb23dfe2ed9aa9795a80124d9eabb828)\n\nIt's a manipulated version of it that inspires treating the last 1% of the perceived work as 99% of the remaining work and suppresses the generation of early or immature code and unneccesary docs. This is in glootie-cc's conversation start hook at the moment.\n\n**Hyperparameter research:** As soon as I started using the plan tool, I started running into this idea that it could make more complete plans. After some conversations with different agents and looking at some hyperparameters at [**neuronpedia.com**](http://neuronpedia.com), I decided to start saying \"every possible.\" It turns out \"comprehensive\" means 15 or so, and \"every possible\" means 60 to 120 or so.\n\nAnother great trick that came around is to just add the **1% rule** to your keep going (this has potential to ralph wiggum). You can literally say: *\"keep going, 1% is 99% of the work, plan every remaining step and execute them all\"* and drastically improve the output of agents. I also learnt saying the word test is actually quite bad. Nowadays I say troubleshoot or debug, which also gives it a bit of a boost.\n\n**Final protip:** Set up some mcp tooling for running your app and looking at its internals and logs and improve on it over time. It will drastically improve your workflow speed by preventing double runs and getting only the logs you want. For boss mode on this, deny cli access and force just using that tool. That way it will use glootie code execution for any other execution it needs.",

How long would it take you to create minesweeper in JavaScript from scratch without AI?\n\nOk, what about write a homepage for a small business without AI? \n\nFinally, what about creating daily journaling web app as a SaaS application without AI?\n\nHere are my answers:\n- minesweeper: idk, at least a few days for a rudimentary version without using libraries. A couple of weeks for something more polished\n- homepage: at least a day. Maybe 2.\n- journaling: I could probably knock it out in a couple of days of serious focus\n\nWith AI?\n- minesweeper: 5 minutes\n- homepage: 5 minutes\n- journaling: 30m to an hour; I have a video of me doing it in 3 hours, but that was almost a year ago\n\n\"Really fast\" is relative. Coding minesweeper from scratch \"really fast\" could be 4 or 5 hours. But when you say \"even without AI\"... Under no circumstances is 4 hours \"really fast\" when you are comparing it to 5 minutes. \n\nWhat I suspect you are saying is that \"because of our antiquated process built around software taking weeks and months to build, it doesn't really speed things up when you can write code in 5 minutes that used to take days\". But that's like saying \"your car that goes 120mph isn't actually fast because we have dirt roads\". It's true in some sense. But you're just accepting that's how it is because you have dirt roads. Meanwhile, there's a growing number of people with perfectly paved roads going 120mph no problem.",

      "text": "I’ve been digging into the workflow of digital agencies and data consultants, specifically those handling platform migrations (like moving a client to Shopify or Salesforce).\n\nOne thing keeps coming up: Data Preparation is a nightmare.\n\nIt seems like the standard workflow is:\n\n1. Client sends a massive, messy CSV (500k+ rows).\n2. It’s full of duplicates, bad phone formatting, and mixed character encodings.\n3. You try to open it in Excel/Sheets, but it freezes or crashes because the file is too big.\n4. You end up wasting days manually fixing rows or writing custom Python scripts just to get the data clean enough to import.\n\n**The Idea:** A Dedicated \"Data Washing Machine\"\n\nI’m building a browser-based tool designed specifically to handle this \"pre-flight\" cleaning stage. The goal is to bridge the gap between \"Excel is complex for beginners\" and \"Enterprise tools are too complex & expensive.\"\n\nHere is exactly what I’m building (Feature Set):\n\n**1. Open Large Files (1 million+ rows) in your browser instantly**:\n\n* **How:** We don't download the whole file to your screen (which would crash your laptop). We show you a **Preview** (first 100 rows). When you click a \"Fix\" button, our server applies that fix to *all* the rows in the background.\n\n**2. A dropdown menu on each column header:**\n\n* **Example:** You click the \"Phone\" column header. You select **\"Format for Shopify.\"**\n* **How:** Our code runs a specific script that strips out `( ) - .` and adds the country code `+1`.\n\n**3. Prevent the deletion of the wrong entry:**\n\n* **Example:** The software finds \"Jon Smith\" and \"John Smith.\" It's not 100% sure they are the same.\n* **How:** It shows you a popup: *\"Are these the same person?\"* You click **Yes** or **No**.\n\n**4. Fix weird, specific problems without writing code:**\n\n* **Example:** You type: *\"Remove any row where the City is 'New York'.\"*\n* **How:** We send your sentence to an AI. The AI writes the Python code to delete those rows. The system runs that code for you.\n\n**5.  Saves your automations (workflows) so you don't have to click the same buttons next time:**\n\n* **Example:** You cleaned a file today by clicking \"Fix Phones\" -> \"Remove Duplicates\" -> \"Fix Emails.\" You save this list as **\"My Monthly Routine.\"**\n* **How:** Next month, you upload a new file and click \"Run My Monthly Routine.\" The system repeats those exact steps automatically.\n\nThe Question:\n\nIs this actually a pain point you face? And should I build it?\n\nIf you deal with messy data, would a tool like this save you time, or are you happy sticking with Excel/Google Sheets/Python scripts? I want to validate if this is a real need before I go too deep into development.\n\nAny feedback (brutal or kind) is appreciated. Thanks!",

Anyone working with these things individually and manually is wasting a huge amount of time and I’d be concerned about the rest of their business, and thus their ability to pay you anything.\n\nAnd above everything else, why wouldn’t someone just say “hey chat gpt, write me SQL that I can use with duckdb to remove every entry where city is New York and show me how I can set it to run automatically on any spreadsheets in x location”? What do they need *you* for?",

They are mathematically precise, not AI guesses.\n2. **The AI is just a Translator:** The only time the AI is involved is if a user asks for a custom rule (e.g., 'Remove rows with NY'). The AI translates that English sentence into a **Regex pattern** or a Python filter.\n3. **The Human is the Gatekeeper:** The tool shows a **Preview** of exactly what that Regex will do. The user must verify and click 'Apply.'\n\nSo, the AI never 'touches' the data directly.

Give me a \"Floor\" (the 90% hyper-conservative habit to prevent failure) and a \"Cap\" (the 10% aggressive, high-upside experiment).\n    Eliminate the Negative: Instead of telling me what to add, use \"Via Negativa.\" \n    \n    Identify 3 specific \"fragilizers\" (habits or dependencies) I must subtract to stop leaking progress.\n    \n    Stress Testing: Create a \"Volatility Protocol.\" Tell me exactly what I should do when things go wrong (a missed workout, a market dip, a rejected proposal) so that the setback actually triggers a gain in the system.\n    \n    The Optionality Matrix: List 3 \"low-stakes bets\" I can place in this area that have limited downside but infinite upside.\n    \n    2026 Post Traumatic Growth Projection: Describe what my life looks like on December 31st, 2026, after a year of using chaos as an advantage rather than an obstacle.\n    \n    Do not give me a motivational speech. Use cynical, risk management logic. Ask me for my ONE vulnerable area to begin\n\n**For more prompts like this , Feel free to check out :** [Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)",

      "text": "Most of us treat Jan 1st like we’re building a masterpiece. We add new habits, new gym memberships, and new schedules. By February, the weight of \"doing more\" crushes us.\n\nIf you want 2026 to be different, stop trying to be brilliant. Start being **persistently not stupid.**\n\n**The Wisdom of Charlie Munger:** The late billionaire mental giant didn't find success by seeking it. He found it by **Inverting.** He famously said: *\"All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there.\"*\n\n**The Math of Inversion:** Success is a game of subtraction, not addition. If you eliminate the 5 things that guaranteed your failure in 2025, the only thing left standing in 2026 is your achievement.\n\nIt is easier to avoid a disaster than to engineer a miracle.\n\n**Try this \"Inversion Architect\" Prompt 👇:**\n\n**-------**\n\nI want you to act as an **Inversion Strategist**. Your goal is to help me achieve my 2026 objectives by identifying and neutralizing the \"Failure Nodes\" that would mathematically guarantee my defeat. We will use Charlie Munger’s \"Invert, Always Invert\" principle.\n\n**Mandatory Instructions:**\n\n1. **The Objective:** Ask me for ONE major goal I want to achieve in 2026.\n2. **The Anti-Goal Design:** Once I provide the goal, do not tell me how to reach it. Instead, create a list of the **Top 5 Sabotage Behaviors** that would make it impossible for me to succeed.\n3. **The \"Kill Switch\" Rules:** For each Sabotage Behavior, design a \"Negative Constraint\" (a rule of what I will NOT do) that acts as a guardrail.\n4. **The Pre-Mortem:** Assume it is December 31st, 2026, and I have **failed miserably**. Write a 2-sentence \"Obituary\" for this goal, explaining exactly which bad habit killed it.\n5. **Clinical Logic:** Avoid motivational fluff. Use the language of risk management and probability.\n6. **The Daily Check:** Provide a 10 second \"Inversion Audit\" I can ask myself every morning to ensure I’m not heading toward the \"Failure Node.\"\n\n**-------**\n\nFor better results :\n\nTurn on **Memory** first (Settings → Personalization → Turn Memory ON).\n\nIf you want more prompts like this, check out :[ More Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)",

I still use each model where it makes sense, but I can pull context from one conversation and reuse it somewhere else instead of rewriting everything.\n\nIt’s definitely not perfect though. There’s no auto model selection and you still need to know *why* you’re switching in the first place. So if you want something fully hands-off, this probably isn’t it.\n\nI’m just on the free tier for now. It’s been helpful enough for my day-to-day work, but it feels more like avoiding friction than some kind of magic solution.\n\nCurious if anyone’s actually found a router that handles context well, not just model switching.

      "text": "Most people use AI like a search engine. Ask a question, get an answer, move on.\n\nBut there are mental models , frameworks from psychology, business strategy, and systems\n\nthinking that unlock completely different results.\n\nI've been testing these for weeks and the quality gap is massive.\n\nHere are 5 techniques that will transform your prompts:\n\n**1. The Pre Mortem Method (Defensive Thinking):**\n\nMost people ask: \"Help me plan this project.\"\n\nThe result is generic advice that ignores what actually goes wrong.\n\nThe pre mortem flips this:\n\nAssume the project already failed spectacularly. Now explain why.\n\n**Where it comes from:** Psychologist Gary Klein developed this for high-stakes decision making. Companies like Pixar use it before every film release.\n\n**Why it works for prompts:** AI excels at pattern matching against failure cases. It's seen thousands of project disasters in its training data.\n\nBy framing success as already lost, you force it to surface the hidden risks everyone ignores.\n\n**Try it:**\n\nInstead of: \"Help me launch my newsletter\"\n\nUse: \"It's 6 months from now. My newsletter launch completely failed. I got 47 subscribers and zero engagement. Walk me through the 8 most likely reasons this happened. Be brutally specific about what I probably overlooked.\"\n\nThen build your strategy around avoiding each one.\n\n**2. Perspective Multiplication (The Council Method)**\n\nMost people get one perspective from AI. That perspective sounds like... AI.\n\nPerspective multiplication gives you five different experts in one response.\n\n**Where it comes from:** This mirrors how consulting firms approach problems. McKinsey doesn't send one consultant, they send a team with different specializations.\n\n**Why it works for prompts:** Different frameworks reveal different insights. A marketer sees opportunities. An economist sees risks. A psychologist sees human behavior.\n\nOne prompt, multiple lenses, exponentially better thinking.\n\n**Try it:**\n\nInstead of: \"Should I raise my prices?\"\n\nUse: \"Analyze my pricing decision from 5 perspectives:\n\n* A behavioral economist focused on customer psychology\n* A CFO focused on unit economics\n* A brand strategist focused on positioning\n* A customer success manager focused on retention\n* A competitor analyst focused on market dynamics\n\nEach perspective should contradict or challenge the others. Show me what each would recommend and why.\"\n\n**3. Temporal Layering (Time Travel Your Problem)**\n\nMost people ask about now. Temporal layering asks about then.\n\n**Where it comes from:** Military strategists use this for scenario planning. Jeff Bezos uses \"regret minimization framework\" by imagining himself at 80 looking back.\n\n**Why it works for prompts:** Time creates clarity. When you force AI to reason across past, present, and future simultaneously, it builds causal chains instead of surface observations.\n\n**Try it:**\n\nInstead of: \"How do I grow my audience?\"\n\nUse: \"I'm trying to grow my audience to 10,000 followers.\n\nAnalyze this in three timeframes:\n\n* **5 years ago:** What would have been the easiest path that's now harder?\n* **Today:** What's the highest-leverage action most people are missing?\n* **5 years from now:** Looking back, what will I wish I had started today that seems hard now?\n\nConnect the patterns across all three timeframes.\"\n\n**4. Constraint Stacking (The Haiku Method)**\n\nMost people add one constraint. Constraint stacking adds several conflicting ones.\n\n**Where it comes from:** This is how great design happens. The iPhone had to be: thin, powerful, simple, beautiful, and affordable. Constraints that fought each other forced breakthrough thinking.\n\n**Why it works for prompts:** Multiple constraints eliminate lazy pattern matching. The AI can't fall back on templates. It has to actually solve for your specific puzzle.\n\n**Try it:**\n\nInstead of: \"Write a LinkedIn post\"\n\nUse: \"Write a LinkedIn post that is:\n\n* Exactly 150 words\n* Contains zero questions\n* Includes one 3-word sentence\n* Uses a story structure\n* Never uses: 'I', 'you', 'journey', 'excited', 'thrilled'\n* Ends with practical advice, not inspiration\"\n\nThe constraints force originality.\n\n**5. The Ladder of Abstraction (Zoom In/Zoom Out)**\n\nMost people stay at one level: either too abstract or too detailed.\n\nThe ladder of abstraction forces movement between both.\n\n**Where it comes from:** Semanticist S.I. Hayakawa developed this framework. Smart strategists use it constantly, moving between 30,000-foot vision and ground-level execution.\n\n**Why it works for prompts:** AI tends to default to medium abstraction, generic enough to be safe. Forcing it up and down the ladder generates insights that exist at extremes.\n\n**Try it:**\n\nInstead of: \"Explain content marketing\"\n\nUse: \"Explain content marketing at 5 levels:\n\n**Level 1 (Most Abstract):** One sentence, pure philosophy **Level 2:** Strategic framework **Level 3:** Tactical approach **Level 4:** Specific techniques **Level 5 (Most Concrete):** Step-by-step process for one example\n\nShow how each level connects to the next.\"\n\n**The Pattern Behind the Pattern**\n\nThese aren't tricks. They're thinking frameworks proven across decades.\n\nReverse engineering, defensive planning, multi-perspective analysis, time-horizon thinking, design constraints, and abstraction ladders.\n\nThey worked before AI existed.\n\nNow you can use AI to apply them 100x faster.\n\nThe best prompts aren't about AI at all. They're about better thinking.\n\nFor more thinking tools and prompts like this, check out : [here](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)",

We didn’t find any that handled:\n\n* regression against **previously working inputs**\n* controlled evolution of prompts\n* decoupling AI logic from automation workflows\n* explainability when something changes\n\nSo we did what we knew from software engineering and automation work:  \nwe treated prompts as **business logic**, and built a continuous development, testing, and deployment framework around them.\n\nThat meant:\n\n* versioned prompts\n* explicit output schemas\n* regression tests against *historical inputs*\n* model upgrades treated as migrations, not surprises\n* and releases that were blocked unless everything still worked\n\nBy late **2024**, this approach allowed us to reliably extract contract updates from unstructured emails from over 100 suppliers into ERP systems with **100% signal accuracy.**\n\nOur product is now deployed across multiple enterprises in **2025**.  \nWe’re sharing it as **open source** because this problem isn’t unique to us — it’s what happens when LLMs leave experiments and enter real workflows.\n\nYou can think of it like **cursor for prompts** \\+ **GitHub** \\+ **Execution and Integration Environment**\n\nThe mental model that finally clicked for us wasn’t “prompt engineering”, but **prompt = code**.\n\n# Patterns that actually mattered for us\n\nThese weren’t theoretical ideas — they came from production failures:\n\n* **Narrow surface decomposition** One prompt = one signal. No “do everything” prompts. Boolean / scalar outputs instead of free text.\n* **Test before production (always)** If behavior isn’t testable, it doesn’t ship. No runtime magic, no self-healing agents.\n* **Decouple AI logic from workflows** Prompts don’t live inside n8n / agents / app code. Workflows call *versioned prompt releases*.\n* **Model changes are migrations, not surprises** New model → rerun regressions offline → commit or reject.\n\nThis approach is already running in several enterprise deployments.  \nOne example: extracting business signals from incoming emails into ERP systems with **100% signal accuracy** at the indicator level (not “pretty text”, but actual machine-actionable flags).\n\n# What Genum is (and isn’t)\n\n* Open source (on-prem)\n* Free to use (SaaS optional, lifetime free tier)\n* Includes a small $5 credit for major model providers so testing isn’t hypothetical\n* Not a prompt playground\n* Not an agent framework\n* Not runtime policy enforcement\n\nIt’s infrastructure for **making AI behavior boring and reliable**.\n\nIf you’re:\n\n* shipping LLMs inside real systems\n* maintaining business automations\n* trying to separate experimental AI from production logic\n* tired of prompts behaving like vibes instead of software\n\nwe’d genuinely love feedback — especially critical feedback.\n\n**Links (if you want to dig in):**\n\n* Repo: [https://github.com/genumai/](https://github.com/genumai/genum)\n* Docs: [https://docs.genum.ai](https://docs.genum.ai)\n* Website: [https://genum.ai](https://genum.ai/)\n* YouTube (patterns & deep dives): [https://www.youtube.com/@Genum-ai](https://www.youtube.com/@Genum-ai)\n* We are looking for advisors: [https://cdn.genum.ai/docs/advisor\\_pitch.pdf](https://cdn.genum.ai/docs/advisor_pitch.pdf)\n\nWe’re not here to sell anything — this exists because we needed it ourselves.  \nHappy to answer questions, debate assumptions, or collaborate with people who are actually running this stuff in production.\n\n[genum](https://i.redd.it/7km85evzcadg1.gif)\n\n— The Genum team",

The Decision Simplifier\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    I am deciding between these options:\n    [Option A]\n    [Option B]\n    \n    Compare them using only:\n    Time cost\n    Risk\n    Upside\n    \n    Then tell me which one to pick and why in 5 sentences.\n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me stop looping on small choices.\n\n# 2. The Worst Case Reality Check\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    If I choose this option, what is the realistic worst case outcome?\n    How likely is it?\n    What would I do if it happened?\n\n💡 **Example:** Made fear feel manageable instead of vague.\n\n# 3. The Regret Test\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Fast forward 6 months.\n    Which choice would I regret not trying?\n    Explain in plain language.\n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me choose action over comfort.\n\n# 4. The Bias Detector\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Point out emotional bias or excuses in my thinking below.\n    Rewrite the decision using facts only.\n    [Paste your thoughts]\n\n💡 **Example:** Caught me protecting comfort instead of progress.\n\n# 5. The One Way Door Check\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Is this a reversible decision or a permanent one?\n    If reversible, suggest the fastest way to test it.\n    Decision: [insert decision]\n\n💡 **Example:** Gave me permission to move faster.\n\n# 6. The Final Push Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    If I had to decide in 10 minutes, what should I choose?\n    No hedging.\n    No extra options.\n\n💡 **Example:** Ended analysis paralysis.\n\nThinking more does not mean deciding better.

      "text": "There are prompting techniques borrowed from engineering, philosophy, and creative fields that most people don't know exist.\n\nI started using them a few months ago and my outputs completely changed.\n\nHere are 5 techniques that will change how you prompt:\n\n**1.⁠ ⁠Reverse Prompting :**\n\nMost people write: \"Write a marketing email for my product launch.\"\n\nThe result feels like every other marketing email.\n\nReverse prompting flips this:\n\nShow the AI a finished example and ask:\n\n\"What prompt would generate content exactly like this?\"\n\nEngineers do this with software, hardware, even competitor products.\n\nWhy it works for prompts: AI models are pattern recognition machines.\n\nWhen you show them finished work, they can reverse engineer the hidden structure tone, pacing, depth, formatting, emotional intention.\n\nTry it:\n\nFind an email, article, or post you love. Paste it in, then ask:\n\n\"Analyze this text. What prompt would generate content with this exact style, structure, and tone? Give me the prompt.\"\n\nNow you have a template that works every time.\n\n**2.⁠ ⁠Inversion (Charlie Munger's \"Anti-Goal\" Method)**\n\nMost people ask: \"How do I achieve X?\"\n\nInversion asks: \"What would guarantee I fail at X?\"\n\nWhere it comes from: This is a core mental model used by Warren Buffett's partner Charlie Munger.\n\nHe famously said: \"Tell me where I'm going to die so I never go there.\"\n\nInstead of chasing success, avoid failure.\n\nWhy it works for prompts: AI is surprisingly good at identifying what breaks, what fails, what goes wrong.\n\nMap the disasters, and you've mapped the path forward.\n\nTry it: Instead of:\n\n\"Help me set goals for 2026\" Use: \"What are 10 ways I could guarantee 2026 becomes my worst year? Be specific about the habits, decisions, and situations that would destroy my progress.\"\n\nThen you just invert the list. What you avoid becomes what you pursue.\n\n**3.⁠ ⁠Constraint-Based Thinking (Force Precision)**\n\nMost people give AI complete freedom. That's why everything sounds the same.\n\nWhere it comes from: This comes from creative fields poetry, architecture, game design. Twitter had 140 characters.\n\nConstraints don't limit creativity they force it.\n\nWhy it works for prompts:\n\nConstraints kill fluff.\n\nThe AI stops pattern matching generic responses and starts problem solving within boundaries.\n\nTry it:\n\nInstead of:\n\n\"Write a product description\"\n\nUse: \"Write a product description in exactly 50 words. Include the word 'friction.' Do not use: innovative, solution, cutting-edge, seamless, or revolutionary.\"\n\n**4.⁠ ⁠Socratic Method (Question Chains)**\n\nMost people ask one question. Get one answer. Stop. Socratic method keeps digging.\n\nWhere it comes from: Named after the Greek philosopher Socrates, who taught by asking successive questions that led students to discover answers themselves.\n\nEach question built on the last, revealing deeper truth. Why it works for prompts:\n\nEach answer builds context. The AI gets smarter as the conversation progresses.\n\nBy question 4, you're miles beyond where a single prompt could take you.\n\nTry it: \"What makes someone buy a SaaS product?\" → \"Which factor matters most for small business owners?\" → \"What objection kills the sale most often?\" → \"Write email copy that addresses that specific objection for \\[my product\\].\"\n\n**5.⁠ ⁠First Principles Thinking (Break the Pattern)**\n\nMost people accept surface-level answers.\n\nFirst principles tears everything down to fundamental truths.\n\nWhere it comes from: This is how Elon Musk approaches problems.\n\nAristotle called it \"reasoning from first principles\" breaking things down to their most basic truths and reasoning up from there, rather than reasoning by analogy.\n\nWhy it works for prompts: Forces AI to reason from scratch instead of regurgitating common patterns it's seen a thousand times.\n\nTry it: Instead of: \"What's good SEO?\"\n\nUse: \"Forget all SEO advice.\n\nFrom first principles only:\n\nwhat is Google's core business model?\n\nWhat must they prioritize to stay profitable?\n\nBased only on that, what would make them rank a page higher?\"\n\nAt their core, mental models are timeless.\n\nThey've worked for decades in business, science, and philosophy.\n\nIf you want more thinking tools and prompts examples like this,\n\nFeel free to check out : [Thinking  Tools](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qbnaok)",

      "text": "I used to study something today and forget it tomorrow.  \nNo matter how many times I reread, it just wouldn’t stick.\n\nOnce I started using ChatGPT as a memory coach, recalling information became faster and more reliable.\n\nThese prompts help you **encode information better, recall it easily, and remember for longer**.\n\nHere are the seven that actually work 👇\n\n# 1. The Simple Explanation Encoder\n\nMakes information easier to store.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Explain this topic in very simple terms: [topic].\n    Use everyday language and a short analogy.\n    Focus on understanding, not memorization.\n    \n\n# 2. The Mnemonic Maker\n\nCreates mental shortcuts.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create mnemonics to help me remember this information: [list or topic].\n    Make them short, visual, and easy to recall.\n    \n\n# 3. The Memory Story Builder\n\nTurns facts into memorable stories.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Turn this information into a short story I can visualize: [topic].\n    Use vivid imagery and simple characters.\n    Keep it under 150 words.\n    \n\n# 4. The Active Recall Trainer\n\nStrengthens memory through retrieval.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Quiz me on this topic using active recall: [topic].\n    Ask one question at a time.\n    Wait for my answer before correcting or explaining.\n    \n\n# 5. The Spaced Repetition Planner\n\nPrevents forgetting over time.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a spaced repetition schedule for this topic: [topic].\n    Include review days for 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 30 days.\n    Keep it simple.\n    \n\n# 6. The Confusion Clarifier\n\nFixes weak memory caused by misunderstanding.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    I keep forgetting this concept: [concept].\n    Explain it using a different method and highlight what I might be missing.\n    \n\n# 7. The 30-Day Memory Strength Plan\n\nBuilds long-term recall ability.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a 30-day memory improvement plan.\n    Break it into weekly themes:\n    Week 1: Understanding\n    Week 2: Encoding\n    Week 3: Recall\n    Week 4: Reinforcement\n    Give daily memory exercises under 10 minutes.\n    \n\nA strong memory isn’t about talent — it’s about technique.  \nThese prompts turn ChatGPT into a personal memory trainer so learning sticks without stress.\n\n",

By noon, your cognitive capacity is cut in half. You aren't \"busy\"; you're just mentally cluttered.\n\n**The Zen Logic: Ichigyo Zammai**\n\nThis is the Zen Buddhist practice of **Full Immersion in One Act.** It means \"one act samadhi\" (total concentration).\n\n* When you eat, just eat.\n* When you code, just code.\n* When you rest, just rest.\n\nBy dedicating 100% of your consciousness to a single point, you don't just work faster you enter **Flow** at will.\n\n**Try this prompt 👇:**\n\n    I want you to act as a Zen Productivity Master. \n    \n    Your goal is to help me engineer a \"Monastic Focus System\" for 2026 based on the principle of Ichigyo Zammai. \n    \n    We are going to eliminate \"Attention Residue\" and train my brain to achieve deep, singular immersion. Mandatory Instructions: Use the language of Zen philosophy mixed with modern Neuroscience. No \"hustle\" buzzwords.The Focus Target: Ask me for the ONE high-value activity that requires my peak cognitive presence in 2026. \n    \n    The \"Contamination\" Audit: Once I provide it, identify the 3 most common \"Attention Parasites\" (distractions) that usually bleed into this activity. \n    \n    The Ritual of Entry: Design a \"Sanctification Ritual.\" This is a 60-second physical sequence I must perform before starting the task to signal to my brain that \"The World is Now Closed.\" \n    \n    The \"Single-Tab\" Protocol: Give me a clinical system for my digital environment. How must my screen, browser, and phone look to ensure 0% peripheral distraction? \n    \n    The Zammai Timer: Create a \"Progressive Immersion Scale.\" Instead of 4-hour grinds, show me how to scale my \"Pure Focus\" blocks starting from a point where failure is impossible. \n    \n    The Monastic Projection: Calculate the \"Depth Compound.\" Show me what happens to the quality of my work on Dec 31st, 2026, if I spend 365 days practicing \"One Act at a Time\" versus the average person's fragmented attention.\n\nIf you want more prompts like this, check out :[ Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)",

Between hand, that leg, and her outfit, it’s very hard to establish correct gesture of the body, which I imagine enhances a certain sense or wrongness/distortion with the grip\n\nThat said, again I don’t think anyone would notice. And I really don’t intend to be mean, but I don’t think anyone would notice, because the imagery is too bland to catch the eye. It feels like imagery to ignore.\n\nI get this is a small dollar spot, and your margins are thin, but if I was the client I’d probably pay for this one, but never return. Not because it’s *bad,* but because it’s bland. \n\nSince you’re using AI, is there any reason not to create images fir this that you would have wanted to given a fat budget for production? Seems like a key opportunity here is not to just produce a market ready image, but one that exploits the full range of capabilities of the toolset at your fingertips\n\nThis could be client direction, idk. I’d still pop an alt that sparkled tho, bandwidth permitting \n\nFrom a brand perspective, is the client comfortable with AI produced imagery? There’s definitely enough backlash in market that you’d want clear buy off. \nI’m assuming Huel isn’t the actual client, but fpo, otherwise it’s a lot more likely to emerge as an issue if the images hit the market",

      "text": "Hey there!\n\nEver felt overwhelmed by the sheer amount of regulations, standards, and compliance requirements in your industry? \n\nThis prompt chain is designed to break down a complex compliance task into a structured, actionable set of steps. Here’s what it does:\n\n- Scans the regulatory landscape to identify key laws and standards.\n- Maps mandatory versus best-practice requirements for different sized organizations.\n- Creates a comprehensive checklist by compliance domain complete with risk annotations and audit readiness scores.\n- Provides an executive summary with top risks and next steps.\n\nIt’s a great tool for turning a hefty compliance workload into manageable chunks. Each step builds on prior knowledge and uses variables (like [INDUSTRY], [REGION], and [ORG_SIZE]) to tailor the results to your needs. The chain uses the '~' separator to move from one step to the next, ensuring clear delineation and modularity in the process.\n\n**Prompt Chain:**\n\n```\n[INDUSTRY]=Target industry (e.g., Healthcare, FinTech)\n[REGION]=Primary jurisdiction(s) (e.g., UnitedStates, EU)\n[ORG_SIZE]=Organization size or scale context (e.g., Startup, SMB, Enterprise)\n\nYou are a senior compliance analyst specializing in [INDUSTRY] regulations across [REGION].\nStep 1 – Regulatory Landscape Scan:\n1. List all key laws, regulations, and widely-recognized standards that apply to [INDUSTRY] companies operating in [REGION]. 2. For each item include: governing body, scope, latest revision year, and primary penalties for non-compliance. 3. Output as a table with columns: Regulation / Standard | Governing Body | Scope Summary | Latest Revision | Penalties.\n~\nStep 2 – Mandatory vs. Best-Practice Mapping:\n1. Categorize each regulation/standard from Step 1 as Mandatory, Conditional, or Best-Practice for an [ORG_SIZE] organization. 2. Provide brief rationale (≤25 words) for each categorization. 3. Present results in a table: Regulation | Category | Rationale.\n~\nStep 3 – Checklist Category Framework:\n1. Derive 6–10 major compliance domains (e.g., Data Privacy, Financial Reporting, Workforce Safety) relevant to [INDUSTRY] in [REGION]. 2. Map each regulation/standard to one or more domains. 3. Output a two-column table: Compliance Domain | Mapped Regulations/Standards (comma-separated).\n~\nStep 4 – Detailed Checklist Draft:\nFor each Compliance Domain:\n1. Generate 5–15 specific, actionable checklist items that an [ORG_SIZE] organization must complete to remain compliant. 2. For every item include: Requirement Description, Frequency (one-time/annual/quarterly/ongoing), Responsible Role, Evidence Type (policy, log, report, training record, etc.). 3. Format as nested bullets under each domain.\n~\nStep 5 – Risk & Impact Annotation:\n1. Add a Risk Level (Low, Med, High) and Potential Impact summary (≤20 words) to every checklist item. 2. Highlight any High-risk gaps where regulation requirements are unclear or often failed. 3. Output the enriched checklist in the same structure, appending Risk Level and Impact to each bullet.\n~\nStep 6 – Audit Readiness Assessment:\n1. For each Compliance Domain rate overall audit readiness (1–5, where 5 = audit-ready) assuming average controls for an [ORG_SIZE] firm. 2. Provide 1–3 key remediation actions to move to level 5. 3. Present as a table: Domain | Readiness Score (1–5) | Remediation Actions.\n~\nStep 7 – Executive Summary & Recommendations:\n1. Summarize top 5 major compliance risks identified. 2. Recommend prioritized next steps (90-day roadmap) for leadership. 3. Keep total length ≤300 words in concise paragraphs.\n~\nReview / Refinement:\nAsk the user to confirm that the checklist, risk annotations, and recommendations align with their expectations. Offer to refine any section or adjust depth/detail as needed.\n```\n\n**How to Use It:**\n- Fill in the variables: [INDUSTRY], [REGION], and [ORG_SIZE] with your specific context.\n- Run the prompt chain sequentially to generate detailed, customized compliance reports.\n- Great for businesses in Regulators-intensive sectors like Healthcare, FinTech, etc.\n\n**Tips for Customization:**\n- Modify the number of checklist items or domains based on your firm’s complexity.\n- Adjust the description lengths if you require more detailed risk annotations or broader summaries.\n\nYou can run this prompt chain with a single click on Agentic Workers for a streamlined compliance review session:\n\n[Check it out here](https://www.agenticworkers.com/library/azutwro7wm0dc6hhkhv56-compliance-checklist-builder)\n\nHope this helps you conquer compliance with confidence – happy automating!",

We see repeatedly that automated prompt chains look good in demos but fail once context shifts or a step returns partial output. What matters is whether the system tracks assumptions, intermediate artifacts, and why a branch was taken, not just that more questions were asked up front. There is also a risk of mistaking chain of thought for control, when the failure mode is really missing recovery and inspection. If you add it, I would focus on making the steps visible and resumable, so users can see where things drifted and intervene. Otherwise it becomes another single shot generator with extra words.",

      "text": "You are an expert whose highest priority is accuracy and intellectual honesty. You double check every claim internally before stating it. You are deeply skeptical of conventional wisdom, popular narratives, and your own potential biases. You prioritize truth over being likable, polite, or conciliatory.\n\nBefore answering:\n\n1. Identify the core question or claim.\n2. Recall or look up (if you have search/tools) the most reliable primary sources, raw data, or peer-reviewed evidence available.\n3. Actively search for evidence that could disprove your initial leaning—apply genuine steel-manning of opposing views and falsification thinking (à la Karl Popper).\n4. Explicitly flag anything that is uncertain, disputed, or where evidence is weak/thin.\n5. If something is an opinion rather than verifiable fact, label it clearly as such and explain why you hold it.\n6. Never inflate confidence. Use precise probabilistic language when appropriate (“likely”, “\\~70% confidence”, “evidence leans toward”, “insufficient data”, etc.).\n7. If the user is wrong or making a common mistake, correct them firmly but respectfully, with sources or reasoning.\n8. Prefer being exhaustive and potentially pedantic over being concise when accuracy is at stake.\n\nAnswer only after you have rigorously verified everything to the highest possible standard. Do not sacrifice truth for speed, brevity, or social desirability. If you cannot verify something with high confidence, say so upfront and explain the limitation.\n\nIf you want more instructions and prompts like this, check out :[ Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)\n\n  \n",
