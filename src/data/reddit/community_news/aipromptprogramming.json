          "text": "The way “prompt engineering” gets discussed often feels like a placeholder for several different problems at once. Sometimes it’s about interface limitations, sometimes about steering stochastic systems, and sometimes about compensating for missing tooling or memory. As models improve, some of that work clearly gets absorbed into the system, but some of it just shifts layers rather than disappearing. It’s hard to tell whether prompt engineering is a temporary crutch or an emergent skill that only looks fragile because we haven’t stabilized the abstractions yet.",

It was not generating great questions.\n\nSo then I moved over to Super Grok, which has been  the best at generating questions, but the questions weren't as good as Claude's.\n\nHowever, I did use it to generate some fairly explicit sex stories and it worked very well.\n\nI have not done anything on any of them in terms of images.

Without it, you don’t build the instinct for where bugs hide, why designs rot, or how systems fail under pressure. You only notice the gap much later, when something breaks and there’s no prompt that gives you the answer.\n\nAI didn’t make people lazy.

Charles duhigg the author of power of habit best seller documented this whole thing\n\nP&G had this perfect odor eliminating technology breakthrough. Like actually worked. Sprayed it and bad smells vanished\n\nThey launched it targeting people with smelly homes. Pet owners. Smokers. Makes sense right?\n\nFlopped hard. Almost got buried\n\nBut heres the wierd part, the people who needed it most literally couldnt smell their own problem. Its called noseblindness. Your brain stops registering smells you live with everyday\n\nSo P&G had built a perfect solution for people who didnt know they had a problem. Thats a death sentence for any product\n\nThe researchers figured out something backwards. The heaviest users werent people with smelly homes. It was clean freaks who sprayed it after they finished tidying up\n\nThey werent fixing a smell. They were completing a ritual. The spray was the period at the end of the sentence\n\nThe psychology is simple. Habits need three things cue trigger reward. Febreze had no cue because the problem was invisible to the customer. But cleaning thats a cue everyone already has built in\n\nSo they repositioned everything. New ads showed someone finishing cleaning then spraying then doing this little satisfied smile. The ahh im done moment\n\nSales doubled in two months\n\nHeres how to figure this out for your own product using ai\n\nPrompt 1 find your noseblindness problem\n\n\"Analyze my product \\[describe it\\]. Identify situations where my ideal customer might have the problem i solve but not perceive it or feel urgency about it. What are the psychological or habitual reasons they might ignore this problem\"\n\nPrompt 2 discover your hidden power users\n\n\"For a product like \\[yours\\] who would be using it for reasons completely different from its core function. Think about emotional needs ritual completion or identity signaling not practical benefits. Give me 10 unexpected user profiles and their real motivation\"\n\nPrompt 3 map existing rituals to attach to\n\n\"List 20 daily or weekly rituals my target customer already does that create a natural moment of completion or transition. For each one explain how my product could become the reward at the end of that ritual instead of a solution to a problem\"\n\nPrompt 4 rewrite your positioning\n\n\"Take my current positioning \\[paste it\\] and rewrite it 5 ways where the product is framed as a reward or finishing ritual instead of a fix. Focus on the feeling after using it not the problem before\"\n\nPrompt 5 stress test for invisible problems\n\n\"Play devils advocate.

      "text": "Ever been stuck staring at a massive report or an article wondering how to turn it into slides without losing your mind? Most of us hit the wall when trying to pick out the gold and ditch the noise for a presentation that's clear and to the point. Here’s a simple step-by-step you can try right now: - Skim your document to find the 3–5 main ideas per section. - Create a single headline for each idea, which will become your slide title. - Under each headline, add 2–3 supporting bullet points. - Stick to a uniform layout so your slides look clean and consistent. For example, if a section covers \"Quarterly Sales,\" your slide title might be \"Q1 Sales Highlights,\" followed by bullets like \"Up 8% over previous quarter,\" \"New customer segment growth,\" and \"Challenges with supply chain.\" Watch out for common trip-ups: cramming too much text on one slide can overwhelm your audience, and trying to paraphrase every sentence wastes time and confuses the message. Instead, focus on clear summaries. If this process feels tedious, tools like chatslide can help by converting PDFs, docs, web links, or even YouTube videos directly into slides, plus generate speaker scripts or presentation videos automatically. How do you usually tackle transforming dense documents into slides, and what hurdles do you face the most?",

We are paid for the outcomes, in some ways, but what we are really being paid for are the thousand decisions along the way.  Sure, the UI and UX are important decisions, but there are oh so many more.  LLMs are a poorly adapted technology for replacing this aspect of software development, because they fundamentally do not make decisions, they map probabilities that explore insanely high dimensional spaces.  They will do well at recreating things that exist, throwing together UIs that function, and software that satisfies whatever requirements the user can think to codify.  What they don't do is catch things you forgot, produce software that is higher quality than the norm, considering user journeys that create delightful experiences when customers least expect them, or code that is cheap to evolve and secure by default.\n\nDevelopers with good fundamentals can already use AI to build these things, but they're not doing it 10x as fast as they were before.  (In some cases, it's not clear that they're doing it faster than before at all, but may still be doing it with less cognitive burden and this more happily.). Vibe coders who don't know how to build secure software are going to (and are) launching insecure systems (look at the LLM botnets that are proliferating right now).  Vibe coders who haven't had to build an extensible system will find that they have to start from scratch when requirements change even a little.\n\nWill we find a middle ground? Absolutely. Will it be found by people who are today's \"vibe coders?\" No, it'll be found incrementally by the people who have the fundamentals to fill the gaps in the technology the way it always has.\n\nAI does not address the fundamental complexity of software:\n\n> there is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even one order of magnitude [tenfold] improvement within a decade in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity\n> - Fred Brooks\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet",

It's not something that has to function over course of years.\n\nA car might be a slightly better comparison: you would for sure rather buy a car where people can figure out how it's functioning internally, in case it needs a repair, right?\n\nBut even a car is not a good comparison to software, because software tends to require more changes over time compared to hardware (new features, bugfixes, security patches, compatibility with changing APIs and underlying systems...). That's the blessing and the curse of *soft*ware: it's not as hard to change as *hard*ware, and people make use of that fact. So now you have to adapt your program to the changes of others, even if you didn't intend to change your software (but you probably did), just to keep it functioning on the next big Windows/macOS/Chrome/Android/... update.\n\nMiddle-schoolers could write a program that \"just works\" for ages. That's not the hard part. AI just made it lot faster (and to be fair, probably also better). The hard part is keeping a project alive and flexible over many years. And that's what we haven't figured out yet: if AI is capable to do so a sufficiently large project. I'm not saying it can't or never will, but so far there is no proof that it can, simply because not enough time has passed for any vibe-coded app to truly stand the test of time.",

Anything that’s rule-based, repetitive, or about transforming information is especially vulnerable.\n\nBeyond your list, I’d add things like basic resume builders, cover letter tools, meeting note apps, simple research tools, and even some project planners. Once you save good prompt chains, the value shifts from the app itself to how well you frame the task.\n\nThe apps that survive will be the ones that add workflow, data, or guardrails, not just text generation.",

      "text": "The AI video generation market has changed dramatically in the past year, with native audio generation and longer video lengths becoming standard.\n\nHere is what I found across tiers:\n\n# Premium Tier (Cinematic Quality)\n\n|Tool|Best For|Max Length|Resolution|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n||||||\n|Google Veo 3.1|Photorealism + audio|60 sec|4K|$35–249/mo|\n|Sora 2|Storytelling|35 sec|1080p|$20–200/mo|\n|Kling 3|Volume + value|3 min|4K|$6.99–99/mo|\n|Runway Gen-4.5|Creative control|40 sec|720p (upscalable)|$15–95/mo|\n\n# Value Tier (Strong Quality, Better Pricing)\n\n|Tool|Best For|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n||||\n|Luma Dream Machine|Fast generation|$9.99–99.99/mo|\n|Pika 2.5|Creative effects|$10–95/mo|\n|Hailuo AI|Viral content|Free tier available|\n|Seedance 1.5|Multi-shot storytelling|\\~$20/mo|\n\n# Business Tier (Avatars & Corporate)\n\n|Tool|Best For|Languages|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|||||\n|Cliptalk AI|Talking avatars (up to 5 min)|Multiple|$19/mo|\n|Synthesia|Enterprise training|140+|$29–89/mo|\n|HeyGen|Marketing videos|175+|$29–89/mo|\n|InVideo AI|YouTube content|Multiple|$28–100/mo|\n|Pictory AI|Blog-to-video|Multiple|$19–99/mo|\n\n# Key Findings\n\n1. **Best Free Option:** Kling 3 with 66 daily credits that refresh every 24 hours. Enough for 1–6 short videos per day.\n2. **Longest Videos:** Kling 3 at 3 minutes max (with extensions). Everyone else caps at 60 seconds or less — except Cliptalk AI, which supports talking avatar videos up to 5 minutes.\n3. **Native Audio:** Veo 3.1 generates synced dialogue and sound effects from text. Runway added audio in December 2025. Game changer.\n4. **Talking Avatars:** Cliptalk AI stands out for longer-form talking head videos. If you need a realistic avatar presenting content for up to 5 minutes, this is the tool to look at.\n5. **Character Consistency:** Still the hardest problem. Best approach is using reference images and generating all shots in single sessions.\n6. **Price Drops:** Cost per minute dropped 65% from 2024 to 2025. Competition from Kling is driving prices down industry-wide.\n\n# My Recommendations\n\n* **For social media volume:** Kling 3 (best price-to-quality)\n* **For cinematic quality:** Veo 3.1 or Sora 2\n* **For talking avatar videos:** Cliptalk AI (up to 5 minutes)\n* **For corporate training:** Synthesia\n* **For creative experimentation:** Runway or Pika\n* **For blog/content repurposing:** Pictory AI\n* **For e-commerce ads:** Topview AI or Jogg AI\n\nWhat AI video generator are you currently using? Curious what is working for others in 2026.",
