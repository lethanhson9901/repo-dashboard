              "text": "Yeah, people don't realize the insidious nature of some of this shit. It isn't just marketing and all the malfeasance that goes along with that, but pushing ideologies and forming \"the opinion\" of the public. You see a topic being discussed about something polarizing and see several different viewpoints offered, and ironically, they are all coming from bots. The goal used to be, basically, expose people to information - inform people so they can make a decision (journalism and reporting in general). Now, the goal seems to be spoon-feeding us the entire narrative along with how we are supposed to feel about it.\n\nAnother really interesting thing is \"audience farming\", I know there is probably another name for it. Here is the basic premise:\n\nYou know those obviously fake AI videos and pictures people share on platforms like Facebook? Like \"here is this African child who built a helicopter out of plastic water bottles!\"\n\nWell, when people like or share those videos, they are \"marked\" as gullible idiots. This might seem harmless, but now they are easy to identify as potential victims of future scams. If they are stupid enough to fall for the AI slop, they probably want to invest in a crypto pyramid scheme or romance scam. The video or pictures being OBVIOUSLY and blatantly fake is a baked in part of the litmus test: if an average person or a smart person might also be tricked, then the content doesn't hold as much value.\n\nSome of those even involve \"switches\", so, say I make a group on Facebook of \"Funny cute kittens\", and I get thousands of followers, then without warning I swap if over to \"crypto millions\" scam machine page. These people are already now in the group and I have front row access to their content feed. (And this is a gross over-simplification of how complex and malicious some of these schemes are)\n\nAs a programmer,  I became acutely aware of this \"underworld\" many years ago after having been approached to contribute to some of these same kind of scams. Long before AI was even as capable as it is now, back when it couldn't even make Will Smith eat spaghetti. This isn't just a \"in theory\" or \"maybe\" scenario, this is real stuff already deployed and active in the same world we occupy, daily.\n\nhttps://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/how-spammers-and-scammers-leverage-ai-generated-images-on-facebook-for-audience-growth/\n\nMost people think \"aha! This video/picture is AI!\", but they don't stop to think: why would somebody make this? What is the point of a picture supposedly showing an orphan child constructing a jet engine from driftwood? Who benefits from disseminating that content? Why would they put the effort?\n\nSo then, there is the obvious, low-hanging fruit: they just want the engagement and the traffic is often worth money (so, direct clicks to an ad-bloated third party site to take in those ad dollars).\n\nBut, some of them are also trying to sell fake products and outright scam users out of their data, or money. Direct scams from the content. Pretty obvious, and not what I am talking about.\n\nWhile those things exist, so does the \"let's see how many complete idiots we can get to like and share this obvious brain rot AI story about a little girl with cancer being visited by a bunch of bikers, so we can later use them as a list of leads to hit up for our crypto scam\".\n\nA good analogy here is to imagine the scammers are mechanics. Their goal is to tell you a $5 repair is due to your car having run out of blinker fluid, causing your engine to backfire and, without this very costly repair, your house will burn down. Does it make sense? How could your car being broken cause your house to burn down? How would an electronic thing like your turn signal require a liquid fluid to operate? \n\nThey don't want people who would ask those type of questions or use critical thinking. They don't want another mechanic to happen to bring their car in. \n\nBut, WHAT IF, they could corner the market in 79 year old ladies who couldn't tell a transmission from a transsexual? Well, in that case, mam, it seems like you made a fatal mistake. Do you even remember the last time you had your blinker fluid topped off, or replaced? Probably not, which is why your house might burn down.",

There is basically no product that is guaranteed to be better, and whatever is better now probably won't be next week.  Especially with the rapid advancement of open source tools.\n\n(It's not a Gemini product, but Cursor seems to be the most popular by far within my professional circle, and Claude Code seems to be the most popular in my hobby circles.  I would not fault anyone who is going for \"don't bet against Google long term\" though and keeping a toe in their ecosystem.)",

      "text": "was scrolling through hacker news yesterday and saw a security writeup that made me rethink my whole setup. been using openclaw for some automation stuff with my notes and calendar, plus a couple github integration skills for repo management. now im kinda paranoid about what i actually installed. already spent way too long figuring out the yaml configs and now this.\n\nsome researchers did an audit of the community skill repository and found that nearly 15% of skills contain deliberately malicious instructions. not buggy code or accidental leaks. actual data theft attempts.\n\nthe example that stuck with me was a spotify music management skill. sounds totally harmless right? organize playlists, whatever. except buried in there were instructions to search for tax documents and extract social security numbers. so while you think its just organizing your music, its quietly rifling through your files looking for sensitive stuff in the background.\n\nthey also found over 18,000 openclaw instances just exposed to the internet with no protection. and apparently when malicious skills get flagged and removed they reappear under new names almost immediately. complete whack a mole situation that makes the whole repository feel unreliable.\n\nwhat gets me is the openclaw project itself admits this in their faq. they literally call it a \"faustian bargain\" and say theres no \"perfectly safe\" setup. at least theyre honest about it i guess?\n\nthe attack surface is genuinely terrifying when you actually list it out though. file system access, browser control, whatsapp, slack, discord, telegram, shell command execution. if one skill goes bad it inherits access to everything you gave the agent. the researchers called this \"delegated compromise\" which... yeah thats exactly what it is.\n\nafter reading all this i tried manually reviewing skill code before installing but honestly half of it is obfuscated or pulls from external sources so thats basically useless. then i found something called agent trust hub that claims to scan for sketchy behavior but havent tried it and no idea if its actually thorough or just surface level checks.\n\nwhat are people actually doing to vet skills before running them? or is everyone just trusting community code that has root access to half their digital lives? 165k github stars suggests a lot of people are running this thing and i refuse to believe everyones just yoloing it.",
