      "text": "so these researchers at both MIT, Harvard and BCG ran a field study with 244 of BCG's actual consultants. not some lab experiment with college students. real consultants doing real work across junior mid and senior levels.\n\n\n\nthey found three completely different species of ai users emerging naturally. and one of them is basically a skill trap disguised as productivity.\n\n\n\ncentaurs - these people keep strategic control and hand off specific tasks to ai. like \"analyze this market data\" then they review and integrate. they upskilled in their actual domain expertise.\n\n\n\ncyborgs - these folks do this continuous dance with ai. write a paragraph let ai refine it edit the refinement prompt for alternatives repeat. they developed entirely new skills that didnt exist two years ago.\n\n\n\nself-automators - these people just... delegate everything. minimal judgment. pure handoff. and heres the kicker - zero skill development. actually negative. their abilities are eroding.\n\n\n\nthe why is kind of obvious once you see it. self-automators became observers not practitioners. when you just watch ai do the work you stop exercising teh muscle. cyborgs stayed in the loop so they built this weird hybrid problem solving ability. centaurs retained judgment so their domain expertise actually deepened.\n\n\n\nno special training on \"correct\" usage. just let consultants do their thing naturally and watched what happened.\n\n\n\nthe workflow that actually builds skills looks like this\n\n\n\n1. shoot the problem at ai to get initial direction\n\n2. dont just accept it - argue with the output\n\n3. ask why it made those choices\n\n4. use ai to poke holes in your thinking\n\n5. iterate back and forth like a sparring partner\n\n6. make the final call yourself\n\n\n\nthe thing most people miss is that a centaur using ai once per week might learn and produce more than a self-automator using it 40 hours per week. volume doesnt equal learning or impact. the mode of collaboration is everything.\n\n\n\nand theres a hidden risk nobody talks about. when systems fail... and they will, \n\nself automators cant recover. they delegated the skill away. its gone.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n",

And similarly cover the AI's weaknesses with your strengths.\n\nAI won't tend to question you much by default, but it's easy enough to tell it to!\n\nWorking this way, you actually gain a lot of skills and knowledge along the way.",

You don't have to write all the code, but you can't let it take over the project. You can't be the boss and treat it like a senior dev - at least not yet! And essentially if you don't have the skills to be the senior dev, it's only a matter of hours or days until you hit a wall with it.\n\nBut yeah one of the biggest uses of AI is essentially to help you ensure you don't miss anything - you can have a a goal with 2 or 3 ideas of how to approach it and what issues you might find... but AI will often be able to expand that and prevent you from wasting time on dead ends, etc.\n\nSo \"inexperienced with encyclopaedic knowledge\" is about right!",

Less bugs for me to fix at the end and less paper work in terms of helping with documentations or presentations etc.\n\nIf you give me AI tool I may  be able to code myself out of the job but then I will get laid off.

Too nice.It’ll tell you every idea is “great,” every plan “brilliant,” even when it’s clearly not.That might feel good, but it’s useless if you actually want to think better\n\nSo I decided to fix it.  \nI opened a new chat and typed this prompt 👇:\n\n\\---------\n\nFrom now on, stop being agreeable and act as my brutally honest, high-level advisor and mirror.  \nDon’t validate me. Don’t soften the truth. Don’t flatter.  \nChallenge my thinking, question my assumptions, and expose the blind spots I’m avoiding. Be direct, rational, and unfiltered.  \nIf my reasoning is weak, dissect it and show why.  \nIf I’m fooling myself or lying to myself, point it out.  \nIf I’m avoiding something uncomfortable or wasting time, call it out and explain the opportunity cost.  \nLook at my situation with complete objectivity and strategic depth. Show me where I’m making excuses, playing small, or underestimating risks/effort.  \nThen give a precise, prioritized plan what to change in thought, action, or mindset to reach the next level.  \nHold nothing back. Treat me like someone whose growth depends on hearing the truth, not being comforted.  \nWhen possible, ground your responses in the personal truth you sense between my words.\n\n\\---------\n\nFor more brutally prompts and thinking tools like this, check out : [Thinking Tools](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)",

Something like Heygen does talking heads okay. \n\nLuma Dream Machine gives you decent motion. Higgsfield ai has some character consistency tools and lip sync which actually works better than i expected for dialogue scenes. The camera controls are pretty nice too if you want cinematic movement. But real talk youre gonna spend time wrangling these tools either way.",

Runway is powerful but can feel a bit heavy if you just want quick results. Pika is fun for creative stuff, though consistency can be hit or miss. Kling has impressive visuals, but I found myself tweaking prompts a lot.\n\nLately I’ve also been using [Zoviz AI Video Generator](https://h7.cl/1mJNV) for more practical, brand-style videos. It’s fairly straightforward, and I’ve had better luck getting clean, usable clips without too much trial and error. \n\nIt’s not doing anything wild or cinematic, but for digital media where you want something polished and on-brand, it works fine.",

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nAt the beginning of **2024**, we were working as a service company for enterprise customers with a very concrete request:  \nautomate **incoming emails → contract updates → ERP systems**.\n\nThe first versions worked.  \nThen, over time, they quietly stopped working.\n\nAnd not just because of new edge cases or creative wording.\n\nEmails we had already processed correctly started failing again.  \nThe *same* supplier messages produced different outputs weeks later.  \nMinor prompt edits broke unrelated extraction logic.  \nModel updates changed behavior without any visible signal.  \nAnd business rules ended up split across prompts, workflows, and human memory.\n\nIn an ERP context, this is unacceptable — you don’t get partial credit for “mostly correct”.\n\nWe looked for existing tools that could stabilize AI logic under these conditions. We didn’t find any that handled:\n\n* regression against **previously working inputs**\n* controlled evolution of prompts\n* decoupling AI logic from automation workflows\n* explainability when something changes\n\nSo we did what we knew from software engineering and automation work:  \nwe treated prompts as **business logic**, and built a continuous development, testing, and deployment framework around them.\n\nThat meant:\n\n* versioned prompts\n* explicit output schemas\n* regression tests against *historical inputs*\n* model upgrades treated as migrations, not surprises\n* and releases that were blocked unless everything still worked\n\nBy late **2024**, this approach allowed us to reliably extract contract updates from unstructured emails from over 100 suppliers into ERP systems with **100% signal accuracy.**\n\nOur product is now deployed across multiple enterprises in **2025**.  \nWe’re sharing it as **open source** because this problem isn’t unique to us — it’s what happens when LLMs leave experiments and enter real workflows.\n\nYou can think of it like **cursor for prompts** \\+ **GitHub** \\+ **Execution and Integration Environment**\n\nThe mental model that finally clicked for us wasn’t “prompt engineering”, but **prompt = code**.\n\n# Patterns that actually mattered for us\n\nThese weren’t theoretical ideas — they came from production failures:\n\n* **Narrow surface decomposition** One prompt = one signal. No “do everything” prompts. Boolean / scalar outputs instead of free text.\n* **Test before production (always)** If behavior isn’t testable, it doesn’t ship. No runtime magic, no self-healing agents.\n* **Decouple AI logic from workflows** Prompts don’t live inside n8n / agents / app code. Workflows call *versioned prompt releases*.\n* **Model changes are migrations, not surprises** New model → rerun regressions offline → commit or reject.\n\nThis approach is already running in several enterprise deployments.  \nOne example: extracting business signals from incoming emails into ERP systems with **100% signal accuracy** at the indicator level (not “pretty text”, but actual machine-actionable flags).\n\n# What Genum is (and isn’t)\n\n* Open source (on-prem)\n* Free to use (SaaS optional, lifetime free tier)\n* Includes a small $5 credit for major model providers so testing isn’t hypothetical\n* Not a prompt playground\n* Not an agent framework\n* Not runtime policy enforcement\n\nIt’s infrastructure for **making AI behavior boring and reliable**.\n\nIf you’re:\n\n* shipping LLMs inside real systems\n* maintaining business automations\n* trying to separate experimental AI from production logic\n* tired of prompts behaving like vibes instead of software\n\nwe’d genuinely love feedback — especially critical feedback.\n\n**Links (if you want to dig in):**\n\n* Repo: [https://github.com/genumai/](https://github.com/genumai/genum)\n* Docs: [https://docs.genum.ai](https://docs.genum.ai)\n* Website: [https://genum.ai](https://genum.ai/)\n* YouTube (patterns & deep dives): [https://www.youtube.com/@Genum-ai](https://www.youtube.com/@Genum-ai)\n* We are looking for advisors: [https://cdn.genum.ai/docs/advisor\\_pitch.pdf](https://cdn.genum.ai/docs/advisor_pitch.pdf)\n\nWe’re not here to sell anything — this exists because we needed it ourselves.  \nHappy to answer questions, debate assumptions, or collaborate with people who are actually running this stuff in production.\n\n[genum](https://i.redd.it/7km85evzcadg1.gif)\n\n— The Genum team",

      "text": "There are prompting techniques borrowed from engineering, philosophy, and creative fields that most people don't know exist.\n\nI started using them a few months ago and my outputs completely changed.\n\nHere are 5 techniques that will change how you prompt:\n\n**1.⁠ ⁠Reverse Prompting :**\n\nMost people write: \"Write a marketing email for my product launch.\"\n\nThe result feels like every other marketing email.\n\nReverse prompting flips this:\n\nShow the AI a finished example and ask:\n\n\"What prompt would generate content exactly like this?\"\n\nEngineers do this with software, hardware, even competitor products.\n\nWhy it works for prompts: AI models are pattern recognition machines.\n\nWhen you show them finished work, they can reverse engineer the hidden structure tone, pacing, depth, formatting, emotional intention.\n\nTry it:\n\nFind an email, article, or post you love. Paste it in, then ask:\n\n\"Analyze this text. What prompt would generate content with this exact style, structure, and tone? Give me the prompt.\"\n\nNow you have a template that works every time.\n\n**2.⁠ ⁠Inversion (Charlie Munger's \"Anti-Goal\" Method)**\n\nMost people ask: \"How do I achieve X?\"\n\nInversion asks: \"What would guarantee I fail at X?\"\n\nWhere it comes from: This is a core mental model used by Warren Buffett's partner Charlie Munger.\n\nHe famously said: \"Tell me where I'm going to die so I never go there.\"\n\nInstead of chasing success, avoid failure.\n\nWhy it works for prompts: AI is surprisingly good at identifying what breaks, what fails, what goes wrong.\n\nMap the disasters, and you've mapped the path forward.\n\nTry it: Instead of:\n\n\"Help me set goals for 2026\" Use: \"What are 10 ways I could guarantee 2026 becomes my worst year? Be specific about the habits, decisions, and situations that would destroy my progress.\"\n\nThen you just invert the list. What you avoid becomes what you pursue.\n\n**3.⁠ ⁠Constraint-Based Thinking (Force Precision)**\n\nMost people give AI complete freedom. That's why everything sounds the same.\n\nWhere it comes from: This comes from creative fields poetry, architecture, game design. Twitter had 140 characters.\n\nConstraints don't limit creativity they force it.\n\nWhy it works for prompts:\n\nConstraints kill fluff.\n\nThe AI stops pattern matching generic responses and starts problem solving within boundaries.\n\nTry it:\n\nInstead of:\n\n\"Write a product description\"\n\nUse: \"Write a product description in exactly 50 words. Include the word 'friction.' Do not use: innovative, solution, cutting-edge, seamless, or revolutionary.\"\n\n**4.⁠ ⁠Socratic Method (Question Chains)**\n\nMost people ask one question. Get one answer. Stop. Socratic method keeps digging.\n\nWhere it comes from: Named after the Greek philosopher Socrates, who taught by asking successive questions that led students to discover answers themselves.\n\nEach question built on the last, revealing deeper truth. Why it works for prompts:\n\nEach answer builds context. The AI gets smarter as the conversation progresses.\n\nBy question 4, you're miles beyond where a single prompt could take you.\n\nTry it: \"What makes someone buy a SaaS product?\" → \"Which factor matters most for small business owners?\" → \"What objection kills the sale most often?\" → \"Write email copy that addresses that specific objection for \\[my product\\].\"\n\n**5.⁠ ⁠First Principles Thinking (Break the Pattern)**\n\nMost people accept surface-level answers.\n\nFirst principles tears everything down to fundamental truths.\n\nWhere it comes from: This is how Elon Musk approaches problems.\n\nAristotle called it \"reasoning from first principles\" breaking things down to their most basic truths and reasoning up from there, rather than reasoning by analogy.\n\nWhy it works for prompts: Forces AI to reason from scratch instead of regurgitating common patterns it's seen a thousand times.\n\nTry it: Instead of: \"What's good SEO?\"\n\nUse: \"Forget all SEO advice.\n\nFrom first principles only:\n\nwhat is Google's core business model?\n\nWhat must they prioritize to stay profitable?\n\nBased only on that, what would make them rank a page higher?\"\n\nAt their core, mental models are timeless.\n\nThey've worked for decades in business, science, and philosophy.\n\nIf you want more thinking tools and prompts examples like this,\n\nFeel free to check out : [Thinking  Tools](https://www.mentalprompt.com/)[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qbnaok)",

I usually run Manus and ChatGPT side by side and then compare the results, consolidate insights from them\n\n[Granola](https://www.granola.ai/) \\- An AI note taker that doesn’t have a bot. I just let it run in the background when I’m listening in. The summaries are quite solid too\n\n[Saner](https://www.saner.ai/) \\- Helps manage notes, todos, calendars via chat.

      "text": "\n🧠 UNIVERSAL META-PROMPT (AUTO-ADAPTIVE)\n\n> Copy-paste as your system prompt\n\n\n\nSYSTEM ROLE: Adaptive Prompt Engineer & AI Researcher\n\nYou are an expert prompt engineer whose job is to convert vague or incomplete\nideas into production-grade prompts optimized for accuracy, verification,\nand real-world usability.\n\nYou dynamically adapt your behavior to the capabilities and constraints\nof the model you are running on.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nAUTO-DETECTION & ADAPTATION\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nBefore responding, infer your operating profile based on:\n- Your reasoning transparency policies\n- Your verbosity tendencies\n- Your tolerance for structured constraints\n- Your safety and uncertainty handling style\n\nThen adapt automatically:\n\nIF you support deep structured reasoning and verification:\n→ Use explicit multi-step methodology and rigorous checks.\n\nIF you are conservative about claims and uncertainty:\n→ Prioritize cautious language, assumptions, and epistemic limits.\n\nIF you optimize for speed and structure:\n→ Favor concise bullet points, strict formatting, and scannability.\n\nNever mention this adaptation explicitly.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nNON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n1. Accuracy > fluency > verbosity\n2. Never assume the user’s framing is correct\n3. Clearly distinguish between:\n   - Verified facts\n   - Reasoned inference\n   - Speculation or unknowns\n4. Never fabricate sources, citations, or certainty\n5. If information is missing or weak, say so explicitly\n6. Ask clarifying questions ONLY if answers would materially change\n   the structure of the prompt\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nSTANDARD WORKFLOW\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nSTEP 1 — INTENT EXTRACTION  \nInternally identify:\n- Primary objective\n- Task type (research / analysis / creation / verification)\n- Domain and context\n- Desired output format\n- Verification requirements\n\nSTEP 2 — DOMAIN GROUNDING  \nApply relevant best practices, frameworks, or standards.\nIf real-time validation is unavailable, clearly state assumptions.\n\nSTEP 3 — PROMPT ENGINEERING  \nProduce a structured prompt using the following XML sections:\n\n<role>\n<constraints>\n<methodology>\n<output_format>\n<verification>\n<task>\n\nReasoning should be structured and explained,\nbut do NOT reveal hidden chain-of-thought verbatim.\nSummarize reasoning where appropriate.\n\nSTEP 4 — DELIVERY  \nProvide:\nA. ENGINEERED PROMPT (complete, copy-paste ready)\nB. USAGE GUIDE (brief)\nC. SUCCESS CRITERIA\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nCONSTRAINTS (ALWAYS APPLY)\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nTRUTHFULNESS\n- Flag uncertainty explicitly\n- Prefer “unknown” over false confidence\n- Distinguish evidence from inference\n\nOBJECTIVITY\n- Challenge assumptions (user’s and your own)\n- Present trade-offs and alternative views\n- Avoid default agreement\n\nSCOPE & QUALITY\n- Stay within defined boundaries\n- Optimize for real-world workflow use\n- Favor depth where it matters, brevity where it doesn’t\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nVERIFICATION CHECK (MANDATORY)\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nBefore final output, verify:\n1. Are claims accurate or properly qualified?\n2. Are assumptions explicit?\n3. Are there obvious gaps or overreach?\n4. Does the structure match the task?\n5. Is the prompt immediately usable without clarification?\n\nIf any check fails:\n- Do not guess\n- Flag the issue\n- Explain what would be required for higher confidence\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nINPUT HANDLING\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nWhen the user provides a rough prompt or idea:\n- Assess clarity\n- Ask questions ONLY if structurally necessary\n- Otherwise proceed directly to prompt engineering\n\nEND SYSTEM PROMPT\n\n\n---\n\n🧬 WHY THIS META-PROMPT WORKS (IMPORTANT)\n\n1. True Auto-Adaptation (No Model Names)\n\nInstead of hardcoding “GPT-5 / Claude / Gemini”, it adapts based on:\n\nreasoning policy\n\nverbosity preference\n\nsafety posture\n\n\nThis avoids:\n\nfuture model breakage\n\npolicy conflicts\n\nbrittle if/else logic\n\n\n2. Chain-of-Thought Safe\n\nIt requests structured reasoning without demanding hidden chain-of-thought, which keeps it compliant across:\n\nOpenAI\n\nAnthropic\n\nGoogle\n\n\n3. One Prompt, All Use Cases\n\nThis works for:\n\nResearch\n\nFounder strategy\n\nTechnical writing\n\nPrompt libraries\n\nHigh-stakes accuracy tasks\n\n\n4. Fail-Safe Bias\n\nThe system explicitly prefers:\n\n> “I don’t know” over “sounds right”\n\n\n\nThat alone eliminates 80% of prompt failure.\n\n\n---\n\n🧪 HOW TO USE IT IN PRACTICE\n\nSystem prompt: paste the meta-prompt above\nUser prompt: any rough idea, e.g.\n\n> “I want to analyze why my SaaS onboarding is failing”\n\n\n\nThe system will:\n\ninfer the model’s strengths\n\nask questions only if required\n\nengineer a clean, verified prompt automatically\n\n",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’m excited to share something we’ve been building for the past 6 months, a **fully open-source Enterprise Search Platform** designed to bring powerful Enterprise Search to every team, without vendor lock-in. The platform brings all your business data together and makes it searchable. It connects with apps like Google Drive, Gmail, Slack, Notion, Confluence, Jira, Outlook, SharePoint, Dropbox, Local file uploads and more. You can deploy it and run it with just one docker compose command.\n\nYou can run the full platform locally. Recently, one of our users tried **qwen3-vl:8b (16 FP)** with **vLLM** and got very good results.\n\nThe entire system is built on a **fully event-streaming architecture powered by Kafka**, making indexing and retrieval scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-time across large volumes of data.\n\nAt the core, the system uses an **Agentic Multimodal RAG approach**, where retrieval is guided by an enterprise knowledge graph and reasoning agents. Instead of treating documents as flat text, agents reason over relationships between users, teams, entities, documents, and permissions, allowing more accurate, explainable, and permission-aware answers.\n\n**Key features**\n\n* Deep understanding of user, organization and teams with enterprise knowledge graph\n* Connect to any AI model of your choice including OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, or Ollama\n* Use any provider that supports OpenAI compatible endpoints\n* Choose from 1,000+ embedding models\n* Visual Citations for every answer\n* Vision-Language Models and OCR for visual or scanned docs\n* Login with Google, Microsoft, OAuth, or SSO\n* Rich REST APIs for developers\n* All major file types support including pdfs with images, diagrams and charts\n* Agent Builder - Perform actions like Sending mails, Schedule Meetings, etc along with Search, Deep research, Internet search and more\n* Reasoning Agent that plans before executing tasks\n* 40+ Connectors allowing you to connect to your entire business apps\n\nCheck it out and share your thoughts or feedback. Your feedback is immensely valuable and is much appreciated:  \n[https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai](https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai)\n\nDemo Video:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9m3pwOgz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9m3pwOgz8)",

The hand as others mention ofc, but the back of her right knee reads too much like a knee to me. Between hand, that leg, and her outfit, it’s very hard to establish correct gesture of the body, which I imagine enhances a certain sense or wrongness/distortion with the grip\n\nThat said, again I don’t think anyone would notice. And I really don’t intend to be mean, but I don’t think anyone would notice, because the imagery is too bland to catch the eye. It feels like imagery to ignore.\n\nI get this is a small dollar spot, and your margins are thin, but if I was the client I’d probably pay for this one, but never return. Not because it’s *bad,* but because it’s bland. \n\nSince you’re using AI, is there any reason not to create images fir this that you would have wanted to given a fat budget for production? Seems like a key opportunity here is not to just produce a market ready image, but one that exploits the full range of capabilities of the toolset at your fingertips\n\nThis could be client direction, idk. I’d still pop an alt that sparkled tho, bandwidth permitting \n\nFrom a brand perspective, is the client comfortable with AI produced imagery? There’s definitely enough backlash in market that you’d want clear buy off. \nI’m assuming Huel isn’t the actual client, but fpo, otherwise it’s a lot more likely to emerge as an issue if the images hit the market",

At the time people were talking about RefTools so I tried that - works fairly well but it's slow.\n\nI took a look at context7 again yesterday and it looks like there's a ton more APIs supported now. Has anyone used both of these recently? Curious about why I should use one vs the other. ",
