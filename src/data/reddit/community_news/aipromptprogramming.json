      "text": "this came from researchers at BYU, Duke and Google Deepmind.\n\n\n\nthey gave ai super specific personas like \"35 year old mom, republican, income $50k, hates spicy food\" and asked it to react to surveys and marketing messages.\n\n\n\ncritics said ai would just hallucinate random opinions. instead it hallucinated the correct biases. like it accurately predicted how specific demographics would irrationally reject products or get offended by ads.\n\n\n\nthe correlation with real human responses was above 0.90. thats basically identical.\n\n\n\nwhy does this work? turns out ai absorbed so much internet data that it internalized how different demographics actually think and react. its not making stuff up. its pattern matching against millions of real human opinions its seen before.\n\n\n\nheres the exact workflow:  \n\n\n1. define your customer avatar in detail (age, job, fears, desires, income, political leaning, whatever matters)\n2. prompt: \"adopt the persona of \\[avatar\\]. you are cynical and tight with money. im going to show you a landing page headline. tell me specifically why you would NOT click it. be brutal.\"\n3. open 5 separate chat sessions with slightly different personas (one busy, one skeptical, one broke, etc)\n4. feed your sales pitch to all 5. if 3 out of 5 reject it for teh same reason, change your pitch.\n\n  \n  \nthe thing most people miss is you need to tell it to be negative. if you ask \"would you buy this\" it says yes to everything. but asking why they WOULDNT buy makes it actually useful.\n\n\n\nthis replaces like $10k in agency fees or $2k in test ad spend. anyone can do real market research now for basically nothing. the playing field is completely equal if you know how to use these tools.",

Humans, and all our beauty, difference, weaknesses, strengths, and worldwide community are being subjugated, and for what?  the whims of Putin, Netanyahu, Trump, Xi, all criminal mafia types, being assisted by Silicon Valley psychopaths who want more power, and the right to do anything and say anything without any riposte (you know, like a 5 year old) .  Probably not the right place for this post, but we need to take a deep breath and focus on humanity, love, and belonging . Jobs are going and they aren't coming back, and hopefully the government and democracies will support people with a welfare net.  But given our apparent abundance in 2026, and the way most rich people talk about poor people (dismissively, judgingly), this doesn't seem to imply they'll suddenly develop empathy and generosity once the poor people become even more peripheral to their private gatherings, private cities, gated communities, private entertainment, with lawyers on hand ready to attack anyone who dares comment on their existence . to clarify, capitalism is amazing (though it's also good we have a weekend and vacations, parental leave etc.), I get the race for AGI in this context, but it's also amazing when we look after old people, veterans without desperately seeking to turn this care into a profit - there is value everywhere for those with eyes to see ",

This paper pioneered the idea of \"Silicon Samples,\" showing that AI can accurately mirror complex political and social attitudes of specific demographics.\n* **Duke University** researchers (including those at the Sanford School of Public Policy) have also published work on **\"Algorithmic Bias\"** and the use of AI as a \"mirror\" for human decision-making, which aligns with the post's claim about AI \"hallucinating the correct biases.\"\n\n**Summary:** The post is real-world \"growth hacking\" advice based on a high-level interpretation of the **Stanford/DeepMind 1,000-person agent study**. The methodology works because LLMs are effectively \"compressed maps of human culture,\" allowing them to simulate the predictable irrationalities of specific groups.",

The user subagent gets a task, interacts with the chat, then passes its “opinion” of how the session went to the judge agent. The judge agent evaluates the feedback and the actual transcript against a set of testing goals and sends the ratings and suggestions for feature changes and bug fixes to my admin panel. \n\nI had to dial back the needless dramatics of the user agent personas and tweak the process, but after a half dozen runs I had some very useful feedback for fixes to give Claude code to implement. \n\nI’m sure theirs is more sophisticated but I can tell you it worked surprisingly well for me to simulate testing users.",

Because everything took longer than it should.\n\nNow I keep a small set of prompts that help me finish faster and sound more put together.\n\nHere are 7 I actually use at work.\n\n# 1. The Clear Task Breakdown\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Break this task into the smallest possible steps.\n    Order them so I can finish fast.\n    Skip anything optional.\n    Task: [paste task]\n\n💡 **Example:** Turned a vague request into a simple checklist I could follow.\n\nBy the way,  I keep prompts like these saved so I do not repeat thinking every day at [AISuperHub](https://www.aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub)\n\n# 2. The Fast Decision Helper\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    I need to decide between these options.\n    List pros and cons briefly.\n    Then tell me which option makes sense and why.\n    Options: [list options]\n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me decide quickly instead of overthinking.\n\n# 3. The Email Reply Shortcut\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Write a short, clear reply to this email.\n    Keep it polite and direct.\n    Do not add extra explanation.\n    Email: [paste email]\n\n💡 **Example:** Replied in minutes instead of rewriting drafts.\n\n# 4. The Meeting Prep Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    I have a meeting about [topic].\n    Give me:\n    1. Three talking points\n    2. One smart question to ask\n    3. One risk to mention if needed\n\n💡 **Example:** Walked into meetings prepared without stress.\n\n# 5. The Manager Update Prompt\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Turn this into a clear status update for my manager.\n    Use short sentences.\n    Focus on progress, blockers, and next steps.\n    Text: [paste notes]\n\n💡 **Example:** Made updates easy and professional.\n\n# 6. The Problem Framer\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Help me explain this problem clearly at work.\n    Structure it as:\n    1. What is happening\n    2. Why it matters\n    3. What I suggest we do\n    Problem: [describe issue]\n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me speak up without rambling.\n\n# 7. The Time Saver Review\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Look at this work.\n    Tell me what can be simplified or removed.\n    Only suggest changes that save time.\n    Content: [paste content]\n\n💡 **Example:** Cut unnecessary work before submitting.\n\nWork feels lighter when things are clear.",

The author links to AISuperHub, which sells \"prompt bundles with resale rights\" - it's a content-to-funnel play dressed up as productivity tips.\n\nNow, the actual content:\n\n**The prompts are too basic to need \"saving.\"** Typing \"break this into steps\" doesn't require a template. You're not saving meaningful cognitive effort here.\n\n**The Meeting Prep one is actively bad for you.** u/Chomblop's comment nailed it - if you're outsourcing your talking points and questions to AI, you're not developing expertise, you're not forming real perspectives, and experienced people *will* notice. That's exactly what gets flagged in promotion discussions: \"They don't seem to have their own views on things.\"\n\n**The data security point is valid (per** **u/**[VorionLightbringer](https://www.reddit.com/user/VorionLightbringer/)**).** Most corporate environments have explicit policies against pasting internal emails and documents into public AI tools. The post treats this as a non-issue, which is irresponsible for \"work productivity\" advice.\n\n**What's actually useful here (barely):** The \"Problem Framer\" structure (what's happening / why it matters / what I suggest) is genuinely good - but it's called **Situation-Complication-Resolution** (SCR) and predates AI by decades. Same with progress/blockers/next steps for status updates. These are standard communication frameworks that work whether you use AI or not.\n\n**The real issue:** If your work \"takes longer than it should,\" the problem usually isn't execution speed - it's unclear requirements, bad processes, or skill gaps. AI accelerates typing, not thinking. Faster mediocrity is still mediocrity.\n\nThe people who'll actually thrive aren't the ones outsourcing the most cognitive work - they're the ones who know which thinking to keep and which to delegate. This post encourages the opposite.",

      "text": "AI is able to write great code. But what it fails at is being able to write consistently the granular details that YOU’VE chosen as the patterns elected throughout your codebase.\n\nIs it possible to keep it consistent currently? Sure, but with context windows as small as they are, I’m spending 3/4ths of my subscriptions on “audit x to verify patterns and ensure it’s the patterns found across the codebase before purposing the plan for a new addition.”\n\nSo I asked myself…  \n\nWhat if we use semantic learning with regex fallback and AST parsing to solve a problem nobody yet solved?\n\nSo here’s what I’ve come up with.  \n\nWe’re going to use AST tree-sitting parsing with semantic learning and regex fallback to parse codebases and index the data, so agents can then query facts instead of grepping 20 files and hoping it gets it right.\n\nWe’ve also created this to run completely offline on any codebase through our custom-built CLI, as well as a first-class MCP server.  \n\nCompletely open-sourced, and the commands to get you started can be found here:  \n\nhttps://github.com/dadbodgeoff/drift\n\nDrift has 75 agent skills built into it as well, which includes high-key infrastructure like circuit breakers, worker health monitoring, worker orchestration, WebSocket management, SSE resilience, and so much more.\n\nHow does Drift help YOU?\n\nOpen an MCP server and let your agent run a scan using \\`drift\\_context\\`. You’re going to ask yourself why anyone hasn’t come up with this yet because I’ve been saying the same thing.\n\nFinally, your agent will have the context it needs to understand the conventions of your codebase. Finally, when utilized correctly, no more refactors or spaghetti.\n\nIt completely eliminates the agent’s need to:\n\n•\tFigure out which tools to call\n\n•\tMake 5–10 separate queries\n\n•\tSynthesize results itself\n\nDrift utilizes call graphs to help agents understand your codebase better.  \n\nAsk the agent to use \\`drift\\_reachability\\` to understand “What data can this line of code ultimately access?”\n\nThis isn’t a replacement for writing code like your typical linter. It is the replacement for keeping code consistent with the conventions and elections you’ve chosen as your grounding, to ensure it stays consistent across all modalities and context windows.\n\nAll items have proper provenance reporting, so you understand why these items are being elected as such, proper persistence, and easy fact-checking. All items are returned with confidence scoring to help eliminate noise and false flags.\n\nExcited for your feedback! I appreciate all the stars on the Git. It means a lot and hope it helps!",

It allowed the brain to idle or go on autopilot between the difficult architectural tasks.\n\nNow, that buffer is gone. AI has stripped away the grunt work, leaving us with nothing but **constant decision-making and logic auditing.** From a neurological perspective, decision-making is one of the most energy-intensive tasks the brain performs. We’ve essentially been promoted from \"builders\" to \"chief auditors.\" The irony is that while our \"AI assistants\" are infinitely productive and never tire, we are forced to review and validate their output at an relentless pace. It’s like supervising an army of workers who never sleep.\n\nWe haven't reduced the mental load; we’ve simply compressed it. We’ve moved the bottleneck from \"typing speed\" to \"judgment capacity.\"\n\nI suspect the next great leap won't be in generation speed, but in solving this \"oversight burden.\" Until then, we haven't exactly been liberated—we've just been reassigned to a higher-pressure post.",

One major difference, is that once fixed, your workload is much smaller:i.e. its not promoted from \"builders\" to \"chief auditors\", but finding alignment between prompts and tasks, you engineer a secondary layer \"task-execution\" prompt that has to be complete and flawless for it to work, then discover finer details clash and AI blindly follows the 'letter of the law'.",

The free trial was short (super frustrating lol)\n*    **GPTGirlfriend** → really strong on the text/roleplay side, deep and fun chats, but the images are a clear step down compared to DarLink A⁤I.\n*    **Cai** → good for general character RP\n*   **Janitor A⁤I** → cool RP options and active community\n\nI’m happy to pay for a subscription or tokens if it’s worth it.. just nothing crazy like $100/month haha. Thinking more like $20 or 30 max.\n\nAny thoughts on DarLink (especially if you’ve used it longer)? Or other options that nail both good RP and great visuals right now? Thanks in advance!",

      "text": "I’ve been trying a bunch of AI workspace apps lately for my work as a small business owner. So just wanted to share my personal experience, what good and bad about them. \n\n**Google Workspace**. With AI added, the gmail is getting way better. Nut it still feels fragmented. My tasks, notes, and thoughts live in different places, and the AI does not tie them together very well.\n\n[Notion](https://www.notion.so) is where you can organize almost anything. The AI helps with writing and create table. But I find myself doing a lot of manual maintenance, and the AI does not really get my work unless I carefully structure everything.\n\n[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google) feels really solid when it comes to chatting with your own documents. But it feels more like a research assistant than a workspace. There is no real sense of projects or task flow.\n\n[Saner](https://saner.ai) is where I can dump notes, tasks, and thoughts without organizing, and just chat to create reminders, pull insights. It feels AI first. The downside is that it is still early with rough edges \n\n[Motion](https://www.usemotion.com) is intense and complicated. I tried it because the AI scheduling promise, but I could not get it easily. Now with documents integrated, it feels like a lot. Or maybe it's just because of my ADD lol\n\n[Tana](https://tana.inc) feels powerful with super tags. It connect you notes, tasks. At the same time, it asks a lot from you upfront. I had to learn how to use it and think just to use it correctly, which is not stressfree.\n\n[Fabric](https://fabric.so) looks promising and modern. But it still feels early. I could not find many long-term, real-world workflow yet\n\nI don't use M365 so don't have insights about Copilot. Did I miss any name?\n\n",
