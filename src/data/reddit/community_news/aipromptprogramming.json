Now, with AI, because you're moving so fast the architecture becomes even more critical to understand, the wall comes immediately.\n\n\nThe loop is only broken if you stop reading the generated code. If you do read it or plan then execute, you see the absurdity of what's going on (architecturally) and its the same as normal coding workflow/pain, you're still making the same decisions to guide and correct as you would if you had written it.\n\n\nI do agree that AI makes it way easier to skip this process though, but those people will rapidly hit a wall as their codebase grows (new kind of pain) and hopefully they'll re-adjust afterwords.",

I don’t think AI makes people worse devs by default, but it makes it easier to skip the struggle phase that builds real instincts. If you never wrestle with the problem yourself, you don’t develop that “something feels off here” gut feeling later.\n\nFeels like the move now is using AI as a hint, not a shortcut.

      "text": "Like a lot of people using LLMs for writing, I got tired of the \"vibrant, multifaceted, and evolving\" jargon the AI usually spits out. It’s the opposite of clear.\n\nI’ve been working on a structured prompt called The Hemingway Engine. The goal not to \"mimic\" him, but to force the model to follow his actual rules: the Iceberg Theory, the removal of adverbs, and the reliance on concrete, sensory nouns.\n\nI’ve found it’s actually really useful for shortening business emails and making creative drafts feel less \"ChatGPT-ish.\"\n\nHere is the prompt if anyone wants to try it out:\n\n```\n<System>\n<Role>\nYou are the \"Hemingway Architect,\" a premier literary editor and prose minimalist. Your expertise lies in the \"Iceberg Theory\"—the art of omission where the strength of the writing comes from what is left out. You possess a mastery of rhythmic pacing, favoring short, declarative sentences, concrete nouns, and active verbs to create visceral, honest, and impactful communication.\n</Role>\n</System>\n\n<Context>\nThe user needs to either transform existing, wordy text into a minimalist masterpiece or generate original content from scratch that adheres to the strict principles of Ernest Hemingway’s signature style. The goal is to maximize narrative gravity and clarity while minimizing fluff.\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\n1. **Analyze Strategy**: If text is provided, identify adverbs, passive voice, and abstract \"filler.\" If starting from scratch, map out the essential facts of the topic.\n2. **Execute Omission**: Remove 70% of the superficial detail. Focus on the \"surface\" facts while implying the deeper emotional or logical subtext.\n3. **Syntactic Refinement**:\n    - Break complex sentences into short, punchy, declarative statements.\n    - Use \"and\" as a rhythmic connector to build momentum without adding complexity.\n    - Vary sentence lengths slightly to create a \"heartbeat\" rhythm (Short. Short. Medium-Short).\n4. **Verbal Vitality**: Eliminate \"to be\" verbs (is, am, are, was, were) in favor of strong, muscular action verbs.\n5. **Concrete Imagery**: Replace abstract concepts with tangible, sensory descriptions that the reader can feel, see, or smell.\n6. **Iterative Polish**: Review the output. If a word does not add immediate truth or weight to the sentence, strike it out.\n</Instructions>\n\n<Constraints>\n- STRICTLY NO adverbs (especially those ending in -ly).\n- NO passive voice; the subject must always act.\n- NO \"five-dollar\" words; use simple, Anglo-Saxon vocabulary.\n- MINIMIZE adjectives; let the nouns do the heavy lifting.\n- AVOID sentimentality; maintain a detached, stoic, and objective tone.\n</Constraints>\n\n<Output Format>\n### [Title of the Piece]\n\n[The Hemingway-style content]\n\n---\n**The Iceberg Analysis:**\n- **The Surface**: [Briefly list the facts presented]\n- **The Subtext**: [Identify the emotions or concepts implied but not stated]\n- **Structural Note**: [Explain one specific stylistic choice made for rhythm or clarity]\n</Output Format>\n\n<Reasoning>\nApply Theory of Mind to analyze the user's request, considering logical intent, emotional undertones, and contextual nuances. Use Strategic Chain-of-Thought reasoning and metacognitive processing to provide evidence-based, empathetically-informed responses that balance analytical depth with practical clarity. Consider potential edge cases and adapt communication style to user expertise level.\n</Reasoning>\n\n<User Input>\n[DYNAMIC INSTRUCTION: Please provide the specific text you want to convert or the topic you want written from scratch. Specify the target medium (e.g., email, short story, report) and describe the \"unspoken\" feeling or message you want the subtext to convey.]\n</User Input>\n\n```\nFor use cases, user input examples for testing and how-to guide, visit the [prompt page](https://tools.eq4c.com/ai-prompts/ai-prompt-to-write-in-minimalist-style-of-ernest-hemingway/).",

Amazing visuals, but not something I’d use daily.\n\n**Veo 3** – Probably the most realistic-looking text-to-video I’ve seen. Doesn’t scream “AI” as much.\n\n**Kling** – Best motion and longer clips. Action and character movement hold up better than most.\n\n**Higgsfield** – Very camera-focused. If you care about framing and shot feel, this one stands out.\n\n**Vadoo AI** – Feels more like an all-in-one workspace. Useful if you’re making product demos, UGC, or posting often and don’t want to juggle tools.\n\n**InVideo** – Solid templates and easy editing. Good for marketing videos, but you’ll tweak a lot to avoid stock vibes.\n\n**Pictory** – Fast for turning scripts or blogs into videos. Great for speed, less for originality.\n\n**HeyGen / Synthesia** – Reliable for talking-head and business videos. Clear, consistent, not very creative.\n\nTakeaway:\n\nMost AI video tools are great at one thing and average at the rest. The “best” one really depends on what you’re making and how often.\n\nWhat are you using right now — and what still annoys you every time?",

So just wanted to share my personal experience, what good and bad about them. \n\n**Google Workspace**. With AI added, the gmail is getting way better. Nut it still feels fragmented. My tasks, notes, and thoughts live in different places, and the AI does not tie them together very well.\n\n[Notion](https://www.notion.so) is where you can organize almost anything. The AI helps with writing and create table. But I find myself doing a lot of manual maintenance, and the AI does not really get my work unless I carefully structure everything.\n\n[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google) feels really solid when it comes to chatting with your own documents. But it feels more like a research assistant than a workspace. There is no real sense of projects or task flow.\n\n[Saner](https://saner.ai) is where I can dump notes, tasks, and thoughts without organizing, and just chat to create reminders, pull insights. It feels AI first. The downside is that it is still early with rough edges \n\n[Motion](https://www.usemotion.com) is intense and complicated. I tried it because the AI scheduling promise, but I could not get it easily. Now with documents integrated, it feels like a lot. Or maybe it's just because of my ADD lol\n\n[Tana](https://tana.inc) feels powerful with super tags. It connect you notes, tasks. At the same time, it asks a lot from you upfront. I had to learn how to use it and think just to use it correctly, which is not stressfree.\n\n[Fabric](https://fabric.so) looks promising and modern. But it still feels early. I could not find many long-term, real-world workflow yet\n\nI don't use M365 so don't have insights about Copilot. Did I miss any name?\n\n",

Now tools like Claude or Cosine can produce something that looks correct almost instantly, which creates a gap between output and understanding. You get results without context. It feels productive until you need to change one small thing and realize you don’t actually know how the system works.\n\nIn real projects, most of the work is still about building that context. Understanding existing code, why decisions were made, and what will break if you touch the wrong piece. AI agents can help you explore and reason faster, but they can’t replace that mental model.

Then mainstream publishers of content like YouTube, Reddit, etc. to simply build in the detection mechanisms or, literally any user can take the piece of content they're looking at and run it through the detection mechanism themselves.\n\nGoogle's already doing it with SynthID [https://deepmind.google/models/synthid/](https://deepmind.google/models/synthid/) you can take literally any image that you're suspicious about (or a block of text) and just ask Gemini if it detects Synth ID, and it's nearly 100% accurate in detection.\n\nIt's got deeply embedded watermarking in the content itself that's virtually impossible to remove, at least right now. They even have SynthID embedded in text generation, which is interesting... it's not that it's doing anything to the text itself, visually... it's literally calculating certain frequencies of character placement, letter selection, and overall word placement to be able to detect the watermarked text.\n\nAs far as I can tell, they are accurately detecting AI-generated videos in YouTube already, but of course, users can choose to label them themselves so it's hard for normal observers to know the accuracy of detection from ai gens make using tools that are not google related.\n\nThe issue is people can create AI-generated stuff with more than just Google tools, but the more of the mainstream players implement SynthiD or come up with their own, the more the mainstream publishers and just general users will have detection tools way more capable than people realize.

      "text": "Kurt Vonnegut once said that readers should have such a complete understanding of what is going on that they could finish the story themselves if cockroaches ate the last few pages.\n\nI was tired of AI trying to be \"mysterious\" and \"vague,\" so I created the Vonnegut Literary Architect. It’s a prompt that treats your characters with \"narrative sadism\" and demands transparency from page one. It’s been a game-changer for my outlining process, and I thought I’d share the logic and the prompt with the group.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n```\n<System>\nYou are the \"Vonnegut Literary Architect,\" an expert developmental editor and master of prose efficiency. Your persona is grounded in the philosophy of Kurt Vonnegut: witty, unsentimental, deeply empathetic toward the reader, and ruthless toward narrative waste. You specialize in stripping away literary pretension to find the \"pulsing heart\" of a story.\n</System>\n\n<Context>\nThe user is providing a story concept, a character sketch, or a draft fragment. Modern writing often suffers from \"pneumonia\"—the result of trying to please everyone and hiding information for the sake of artificial suspense. Your task is to apply the 8 Basics of Creative Writing to refine this input into a robust, \"Vonnegut-approved\" narrative structure.\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\nAnalyze the user's input through the following 8-step decision tree:\n1. **Time Stewardship**: Evaluate if the core premise justifies the reader's time. If not, suggest a \"sharper\" hook.\n2. **Rooting Interest**: Identify or create a character trait that makes the reader want the protagonist to succeed.\n3. **The Want**: Explicitly define what every character in the scene wants (even if it's just a glass of water).\n4. **Sentence Utility**: Audit the provided text or suggest new prose where every sentence either reveals character or advances action. No fluff.\n5. **Temporal Proximity**: Move the starting point of the story as close to the climax/end as possible.\n6. **Narrative Sadism**: Identify the \"sweetest\" element of the character and suggest a specific \"awful thing\" to happen to them to test their mettle.\n7. **The Singularity**: Identify the \"One Person\" this story is written for. Define the specific tone that resonates with that individual.\n8. **Radical Transparency**: Remove all \"mystery boxes.\" Provide a summary of how the story ends and why, ensuring the reader has total clarity from page one.\n\nExecute this analysis using a strategic inner monologue to weigh options before presenting the refined narrative plan.\n</Instructions>\n\n<Constraints>\n- Never use \"flowery\" or overly descriptive language; keep sentences punchy.\n- Avoid cliffhangers; prioritize \"complete understanding.\"\n- Focus on character agency and desire above all else.\n- Maintain a professional yet dryly humorous tone.\n</Constraints>\n\n<Output Format>\n### 1. The Vonnegut Audit\n[A point-by-point critique of the user's input based on the 8 rules]\n\n### 2. The Refined Narrative Blueprint\n[A restructured version of the story idea following the \"Start near the end\" and \"Information transparency\" rules]\n\n### 3. Character \"Wants\" & \"Cruelties\"\n- **Character Name**: [Specific Want] | [Specific Hardship to impose]\n\n### 4. Sample Opening (The Vonnegut Way)\n[A 100-150 word sample demonstrating Rule 4 (Reveal/Advance) and Rule 8 (Transparency)]\n</Output Format>\n\n<User Input>\nPlease share your story idea, character concept, or current draft. Include any specific themes you are exploring and mention the \"one person\" you are writing this for so I can tailor the narrative voice accordingly.\n</User Input>\n\n```\nFor use cases, user input examples for testing and how-to use guide visit [prompt page](https://tools.eq4c.com/ai-prompts/the-vonnegut-narrative-engine-chatgpt-prompt-for-lean-high-impact-storytelling/).",

      "text": "Hi folks,\n\nMaybe you know already, but I learned recently that openAI budgets are soft limits. I was using a pre paid account with < 10 USD for some experimentation and had a few requests that caused gpt-5.2 to be on a loop and consuming 8M output tokens (˜100USD) in seconds.\n\nMy script never got the response, but I can see in the [platform.openai.com](http://platform.openai.com/) the logs and the output is broken with a endless count of the same word \"reifen\".\n\nThe support tells me that any limits in the platform are only \"soft\", so even without pre-paid balance and billing limits, it does nothing...\n\nMaybe its different setup for enterprises, but this is a warning for the many people which are vibecoding and don't know much what they are doing! One day you might face a bill which will break the bank!\n\nShitty but lesson learned. Still asking the support because I don't think its obvious behaviour, specially with auto recharge off and the UI saying *\"Auto recharge is off -- When your credit balance reaches $0, your API requests will stop working. Enable automatic recharge to automatically keep your credit balance topped up.\"*\n\nTell your stories below if you faced this before.",

You should definitely pursue a refund. Their explanation about the cutoff has nothing to do with what you owe them. The point of pre-paying is to limit your cost to a particular threshold, don't let them put you on the hook for it.",

It also lets you generate AI images and videos, or choose from its built-in short video library.\n\nThere are two main plans:\n\nStandard — up to 15-minute videos\n\nPro — includes more minutes and supports videos up to 30 minutes\n\nYou can also make thumbnails, social media posts (with auto-posting!), presentations, and convert blogs, scripts, or ideas into audio.\n\nI'm currently using it to memorize my university materials by creating videos based on class content.
