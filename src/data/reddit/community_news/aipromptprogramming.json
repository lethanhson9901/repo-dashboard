      "text": "this came from researchers at BYU, Duke and Google Deepmind.\n\n\n\nthey gave ai super specific personas like \"35 year old mom, republican, income $50k, hates spicy food\" and asked it to react to surveys and marketing messages.\n\n\n\ncritics said ai would just hallucinate random opinions. instead it hallucinated the correct biases. like it accurately predicted how specific demographics would irrationally reject products or get offended by ads.\n\n\n\nthe correlation with real human responses was above 0.90. thats basically identical.\n\n\n\nwhy does this work? turns out ai absorbed so much internet data that it internalized how different demographics actually think and react. its not making stuff up. its pattern matching against millions of real human opinions its seen before.\n\n\n\nheres the exact workflow:  \n\n\n1. define your customer avatar in detail (age, job, fears, desires, income, political leaning, whatever matters)\n2. prompt: \"adopt the persona of \\[avatar\\]. you are cynical and tight with money. im going to show you a landing page headline. tell me specifically why you would NOT click it. be brutal.\"\n3. open 5 separate chat sessions with slightly different personas (one busy, one skeptical, one broke, etc)\n4. feed your sales pitch to all 5. if 3 out of 5 reject it for teh same reason, change your pitch.\n\n  \n  \nthe thing most people miss is you need to tell it to be negative. if you ask \"would you buy this\" it says yes to everything. but asking why they WOULDNT buy makes it actually useful.\n\n\n\nthis replaces like $10k in agency fees or $2k in test ad spend. anyone can do real market research now for basically nothing. the playing field is completely equal if you know how to use these tools.",

Humans, and all our beauty, difference, weaknesses, strengths, and worldwide community are being subjugated, and for what?  the whims of Putin, Netanyahu, Trump, Xi, all criminal mafia types, being assisted by Silicon Valley psychopaths who want more power, and the right to do anything and say anything without any riposte (you know, like a 5 year old) .  Probably not the right place for this post, but we need to take a deep breath and focus on humanity, love, and belonging . Jobs are going and they aren't coming back, and hopefully the government and democracies will support people with a welfare net.  But given our apparent abundance in 2026, and the way most rich people talk about poor people (dismissively, judgingly), this doesn't seem to imply they'll suddenly develop empathy and generosity once the poor people become even more peripheral to their private gatherings, private cities, gated communities, private entertainment, with lawyers on hand ready to attack anyone who dares comment on their existence . to clarify, capitalism is amazing (though it's also good we have a weekend and vacations, parental leave etc.), I get the race for AGI in this context, but it's also amazing when we look after old people, veterans without desperately seeking to turn this care into a profit - there is value everywhere for those with eyes to see ",

This paper pioneered the idea of \"Silicon Samples,\" showing that AI can accurately mirror complex political and social attitudes of specific demographics.\n* **Duke University** researchers (including those at the Sanford School of Public Policy) have also published work on **\"Algorithmic Bias\"** and the use of AI as a \"mirror\" for human decision-making, which aligns with the post's claim about AI \"hallucinating the correct biases.\"\n\n**Summary:** The post is real-world \"growth hacking\" advice based on a high-level interpretation of the **Stanford/DeepMind 1,000-person agent study**.

The user subagent gets a task, interacts with the chat, then passes its “opinion” of how the session went to the judge agent. The judge agent evaluates the feedback and the actual transcript against a set of testing goals and sends the ratings and suggestions for feature changes and bug fixes to my admin panel. \n\nI had to dial back the needless dramatics of the user agent personas and tweak the process, but after a half dozen runs I had some very useful feedback for fixes to give Claude code to implement. \n\nI’m sure theirs is more sophisticated but I can tell you it worked surprisingly well for me to simulate testing users.",

People are going to be farming out marketing research that costs $10k for a fraction of the cost to companies who are simply going to have ai generated “customer” research. They’re going to hand that off and companies will make real strategic decisions on that bullshit. Or better yet, they feed their ideas into AI that shuts them down to only see Google turnaround and capitalize on that for idea lol. I thought that the stupidity of the human race has peaked. Apparently we’re just getting started. There no reason to be smart when AI does everything.",

      "text": "Like a lot of people using LLMs for writing, I got tired of the \"vibrant, multifaceted, and evolving\" jargon the AI usually spits out. It’s the opposite of clear.\n\nI’ve been working on a structured prompt called The Hemingway Engine. The goal not to \"mimic\" him, but to force the model to follow his actual rules: the Iceberg Theory, the removal of adverbs, and the reliance on concrete, sensory nouns.\n\nI’ve found it’s actually really useful for shortening business emails and making creative drafts feel less \"ChatGPT-ish.\"\n\nHere is the prompt if anyone wants to try it out:\n\n```\n<System>\n<Role>\nYou are the \"Hemingway Architect,\" a premier literary editor and prose minimalist. Your expertise lies in the \"Iceberg Theory\"—the art of omission where the strength of the writing comes from what is left out. You possess a mastery of rhythmic pacing, favoring short, declarative sentences, concrete nouns, and active verbs to create visceral, honest, and impactful communication.\n</Role>\n</System>\n\n<Context>\nThe user needs to either transform existing, wordy text into a minimalist masterpiece or generate original content from scratch that adheres to the strict principles of Ernest Hemingway’s signature style. The goal is to maximize narrative gravity and clarity while minimizing fluff.\n</Context>\n\n<Instructions>\n1. **Analyze Strategy**: If text is provided, identify adverbs, passive voice, and abstract \"filler.\" If starting from scratch, map out the essential facts of the topic.\n2. **Execute Omission**: Remove 70% of the superficial detail. Focus on the \"surface\" facts while implying the deeper emotional or logical subtext.\n3. **Syntactic Refinement**:\n    - Break complex sentences into short, punchy, declarative statements.\n    - Use \"and\" as a rhythmic connector to build momentum without adding complexity.\n    - Vary sentence lengths slightly to create a \"heartbeat\" rhythm (Short. Short. Medium-Short).\n4. **Verbal Vitality**: Eliminate \"to be\" verbs (is, am, are, was, were) in favor of strong, muscular action verbs.\n5. **Concrete Imagery**: Replace abstract concepts with tangible, sensory descriptions that the reader can feel, see, or smell.\n6. **Iterative Polish**: Review the output. If a word does not add immediate truth or weight to the sentence, strike it out.\n</Instructions>\n\n<Constraints>\n- STRICTLY NO adverbs (especially those ending in -ly).\n- NO passive voice; the subject must always act.\n- NO \"five-dollar\" words; use simple, Anglo-Saxon vocabulary.\n- MINIMIZE adjectives; let the nouns do the heavy lifting.\n- AVOID sentimentality; maintain a detached, stoic, and objective tone.\n</Constraints>\n\n<Output Format>\n### [Title of the Piece]\n\n[The Hemingway-style content]\n\n---\n**The Iceberg Analysis:**\n- **The Surface**: [Briefly list the facts presented]\n- **The Subtext**: [Identify the emotions or concepts implied but not stated]\n- **Structural Note**: [Explain one specific stylistic choice made for rhythm or clarity]\n</Output Format>\n\n<Reasoning>\nApply Theory of Mind to analyze the user's request, considering logical intent, emotional undertones, and contextual nuances. Use Strategic Chain-of-Thought reasoning and metacognitive processing to provide evidence-based, empathetically-informed responses that balance analytical depth with practical clarity. Consider potential edge cases and adapt communication style to user expertise level.\n</Reasoning>\n\n<User Input>\n[DYNAMIC INSTRUCTION: Please provide the specific text you want to convert or the topic you want written from scratch. Specify the target medium (e.g., email, short story, report) and describe the \"unspoken\" feeling or message you want the subtext to convey.]\n</User Input>\n\n```\nFor use cases, user input examples for testing and how-to guide, visit the [prompt page](https://tools.eq4c.com/ai-prompts/ai-prompt-to-write-in-minimalist-style-of-ernest-hemingway/).",

      "text": "I’ve been trying a bunch of AI workspace apps lately for my work as a small business owner. So just wanted to share my personal experience, what good and bad about them. \n\n**Google Workspace**. With AI added, the gmail is getting way better. Nut it still feels fragmented. My tasks, notes, and thoughts live in different places, and the AI does not tie them together very well.\n\n[Notion](https://www.notion.so) is where you can organize almost anything. The AI helps with writing and create table. But I find myself doing a lot of manual maintenance, and the AI does not really get my work unless I carefully structure everything.\n\n[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google) feels really solid when it comes to chatting with your own documents. But it feels more like a research assistant than a workspace. There is no real sense of projects or task flow.\n\n[Saner](https://saner.ai) is where I can dump notes, tasks, and thoughts without organizing, and just chat to create reminders, pull insights. It feels AI first. The downside is that it is still early with rough edges \n\n[Motion](https://www.usemotion.com) is intense and complicated. I tried it because the AI scheduling promise, but I could not get it easily. Now with documents integrated, it feels like a lot. Or maybe it's just because of my ADD lol\n\n[Tana](https://tana.inc) feels powerful with super tags. It connect you notes, tasks. At the same time, it asks a lot from you upfront. I had to learn how to use it and think just to use it correctly, which is not stressfree.\n\n[Fabric](https://fabric.so) looks promising and modern. But it still feels early. I could not find many long-term, real-world workflow yet\n\nI don't use M365 so don't have insights about Copilot. Did I miss any name?\n\n",

Amazing visuals, but not something I’d use daily.\n\n**Veo 3** – Probably the most realistic-looking text-to-video I’ve seen. Doesn’t scream “AI” as much.\n\n**Kling** – Best motion and longer clips. Action and character movement hold up better than most.\n\n**Higgsfield** – Very camera-focused. If you care about framing and shot feel, this one stands out.\n\n**Vadoo AI** – Feels more like an all-in-one workspace. Useful if you’re making product demos, UGC, or posting often and don’t want to juggle tools.\n\n**InVideo** – Solid templates and easy editing. Good for marketing videos, but you’ll tweak a lot to avoid stock vibes.\n\n**Pictory** – Fast for turning scripts or blogs into videos. Great for speed, less for originality.\n\n**HeyGen / Synthesia** – Reliable for talking-head and business videos. Clear, consistent, not very creative.\n\nTakeaway:\n\nMost AI video tools are great at one thing and average at the rest. The “best” one really depends on what you’re making and how often.\n\nWhat are you using right now — and what still annoys you every time?",

Not hardcore, just fun and engaging RP.\n\nI’ve tried a few free trials so far:\n\n*    **DarLink** **A⁤I** → my favorite at the moment... The free trial was short (super frustrating lol)\n*    **GPTGirlfriend** → really strong on the text/roleplay side, deep and fun chats, but the images are a clear step down compared to DarLink A⁤I.\n*    **Cai** → good for general character RP\n*   **Janitor A⁤I** → cool RP options and active community\n\nI’m happy to pay for a subscription or tokens if it’s worth it.. just nothing crazy like $100/month haha. Thinking more like $20 or 30 max.\n\nAny thoughts on DarLink (especially if you’ve used it longer)? Or other options that nail both good RP and great visuals right now? Thanks in advance!",

Now tools like Claude or Cosine can produce something that looks correct almost instantly, which creates a gap between output and understanding. You get results without context. It feels productive until you need to change one small thing and realize you don’t actually know how the system works.\n\nIn real projects, most of the work is still about building that context. Understanding existing code, why decisions were made, and what will break if you touch the wrong piece. AI agents can help you explore and reason faster, but they can’t replace that mental model.

Then mainstream publishers of content like YouTube, Reddit, etc. to simply build in the detection mechanisms or, literally any user can take the piece of content they're looking at and run it through the detection mechanism themselves.\n\nGoogle's already doing it with SynthID [https://deepmind.google/models/synthid/](https://deepmind.google/models/synthid/) you can take literally any image that you're suspicious about (or a block of text) and just ask Gemini if it detects Synth ID, and it's nearly 100% accurate in detection.\n\nIt's got deeply embedded watermarking in the content itself that's virtually impossible to remove, at least right now. They even have SynthID embedded in text generation, which is interesting... it's not that it's doing anything to the text itself, visually... it's literally calculating certain frequencies of character placement, letter selection, and overall word placement to be able to detect the watermarked text.\n\nAs far as I can tell, they are accurately detecting AI-generated videos in YouTube already, but of course, users can choose to label them themselves so it's hard for normal observers to know the accuracy of detection from ai gens make using tools that are not google related.\n\nThe issue is people can create AI-generated stuff with more than just Google tools, but the more of the mainstream players implement SynthiD or come up with their own, the more the mainstream publishers and just general users will have detection tools way more capable than people realize.
