Even good ones who study up and use tools and techniques developed by others need to apply what they learn and pivot cleverly as they work to be effective. Public perception is based on the media so many think all hackers are geniuses while most low tier ones are less clever than an average skilled burglar. But saying the people developing tools and selling kits that are causing mass financial suffering aren't at least pretty intelligent sounds crazy to me.",

A chef creates from nothing. It requires intricate knowledge of the tools and resources and techniques available. Creating their own methods and techniques, and discovering new ways to do things.\n\nSimilar as a \"script kiddie\" and a \"hacker\" (e.g. security researchers, exploit developers etc...).\n\nOne uses pre-defined tools and methods, the other creates them.\n\nYou can't study what doesn't yet exist. Top-tier hackers are looking for 0-days. Bugs/exploits that don't yet exist. You can't read a book thet tells you how to find them. It requires deep knowledge and understanding of multiple layers of code. Often down to a machine-level for those more serious about it. You're mentally processing memory dumps, assembly, and forming a complex model of the environment in your head. It often requires very deep analytics occuring up in the grey matter. A top-tier hacker is up against potentially hundreds of very intelligent software and security engineers designing ways to stop them.",

I have been \"retired\" but spent years and years finding exploits for US Samsung devices (root exploits and bootloader exploits) that didn't exist yet. Had to constantly stay up on Android/Samsung security, had to know the ins and outs of pretty much everything involved from hardware, software, processors, kernels, bootloaders etc. etc. I retired myself when it wasn't fun anymore lol.. Was nice though getting paid for bug bounties. I would report the major exploits to Samsung. Root exploits I would release publicly because that was the whole reason I got into it in the first place, because Samsung and the US carriers lock the bootloaders on US devices. I was surprised at how horrible the security was back then. Like having the bootloader root the device on startup simply by changing prop setting 😅. It was ranked critical and I got like 5k for that one lol.",

There are more modern stacks I'm sure, but in 1999 I was doing some self stjdy/research into how I might be able to leverage other computers to do stuff like crack encryption and hash tables and other things I will stay mum on. But, point is a couple of years later when I was brought as specialist at an executive protection agency as an EP agent and THE investigative agent for the digital domain (was just the first hire that had an IT background) one of the ways I got some serious points with the boss and the owner was creating the Beowulf cluster in a proper environment complete with Diskless Booting Linux via triggering reboots after sending a command to the dhcp server in the corporate network. The dhcp would point all new dhcp requests to the rftp server which served up a pxe image, in turn serving up DBlinux and the Linux image that was booted immediately would start up  Beowulf nodes on all workstations and the cluster command nodes would start serving up jobs, distributing workloads to crack the passwords of targets whose personal files we'd obtained an needed to open to continue forensics on, as well as the occasional target:s system that may or may not have had logins that miiiight have been eventually accessed via passwords that were obtained... No further comment, but I hope this was, while long winded, at least somewhat helpful as an example of one of the ways you can leverage the cloud or any group of heteregenous hardware across any span of distance to accomplish a task like what you mentioned. If the tooling yiu are using to accomplish a crack are parallel and hopefully capable of distributed processing, you're golden.",

          "text": "Overkill. You should never list numerous certs unless they cover different topics otherwise it’s seen as overcompensating. Also, who cares about “how advanced you are”? Focus on accomplishing the objective and forget about meaningless script kiddie vs real hacker arguments. Script kiddies can get lucky and nation states fail daily. Hell a lot of nation states including Salt Typhoon and GRU units 74455 exploit known CVEs in non patched software so I don’t see why a “script kiddie” would be any less for using online tools. There was also this other Russian hacker group that literally just sprayed the internet for default ftp creds for their ransomware campaigns. Also, Dos isn’t always script kiddie shit. If you can trigger a remote process crash in something like bind9 DNS, then you can bring thousands of end devices tumbling down with it. Imagine those big DNS outages but as an attack and not as an accidental update. My point is that the “title” doesn’t matter and that your objective is the only thing that matters. Your level of sophistication won’t matter if you fail and it won’t matter if you succeed.\n\nThe biggest thing is establishing a goal. Are you hacking to hack or are you hacking for employment? If it’s for employment, you need to look at what the job roles you want are asking for. Take 30 minutes out of your day to write down the number of times a certification is listed on a job posting.\nALSO for employment, your biggest priority is compliance. If you are in a country that requires certification compliance or you work in a government setting then you will likely need something like sec+ to even legally touch the system. \n\nFocus on the knowledge (not doubting you have it if you did CPTS) and focus on accomplishing objectives. Now, if you are hacking for the love of the game, just hack. I’m not going to tell you to do anything illegal but what I will say is that I feel like corporatized hacking created a generation that’s hacking for scholarly recognition and employment instead of hacking for the love of the game. Obviously many hackers hack just to hack and jump on employment opportunities, but it takes the fun out of it in my opinion.\n\nHere’s the real question… do you want to BE good at hacking or PERCEIVED as good at hacking. Notoriety is a driving force for a lot but the best hackers I met could give a shit less if the world knew about how good they were. Best guy I know has an almost 20 year old zero day that still hasn’t been patched. This was in the government sector obviously but guys like him don’t even enjoy DEFCON because it isn’t difficult enough. \n\nI would say that going through HTB would not put you at a level above the HR checklist people because the HR checklist people get hired and touch real targets. CTFs are great but nothing can emulate a real target. Having a predefined way in takes the essence of hacking away even if it’s a difficult CTF because you know there’s a solution. Only way to hack real targets for real experience is getting hired, doing it illegally, or purchasing things to hack. This is why I opt for hardware hacking and binary hacking, I can keep the chaos of the unknown without looking over my shoulder for committing a crime and I’m not getting bored of a CTF. \n\nI will also say that the HR checklist doesn’t make you better than the CTF player because you could either lie on your resume or burn through certifications without retaining knowledge.\n\nSo in conclusion, those certs are good but you gain nothing by stacking them up unless a job specifically asks for multiple. For example, listing OSCP and CPTS would be redundant but the combination of OSED+OSCP or OSED+CPTS is fine because OSED is exploit development and the others are pentesting. The riches are in the niches so I recommend finding a niche and hacking the shit out of it. \n\nPersonal note: if you want to be god tier, just learn binary exploitation. Having your own zero day in your back pocket feels great. When you learn how to find zero days you can pretty much choose any software you want to target and sell it to a broker. Or you could keep the zero day for extracurricular reasons, the choice is yours.",

I thought it was a great idea because running Kali directly from a live pendrive allows the system to use my hardware resources (especially RAM) more efficiently.\n\nSo, I switched to a live-booted pendrive. However, after doing this, I started facing an issue: when I use Kali Linux from the live USB, my internet speed becomes extremely slow—it feels like it’s running at a turtle’s pace. But when I run Kali Linux inside VirtualBox on Windows, the internet works perfectly fine and is very fast.\n\nI’m confused about why this is happening and how to fix the slow internet issue on live-booted Kali. Can you please help me resolve this?",
