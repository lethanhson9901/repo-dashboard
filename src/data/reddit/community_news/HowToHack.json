      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nAs I’m learning cybersecurity, I’m slowly realizing how much we’re tracked online, and honestly it’s messing with my head. It feels like every click, search, and action is being watched not just data breaches, but the whole internet model itself.\n\nI really value privacy and love the idea of digital anonymity. I know 100% anonymity isn’t possible (especially if governments get involved), but that’s not what I’m asking.\n\nWhat I want to know is:\n\nHow anonymous can a normal person realistically get?\n\nHow many layers can we hide behind?\n\nHow hard can we make it for OSINT or basic tracking to identify us?\n\n\nI don’t want my entire digital life popping up just because someone searched my name. I’m curious about the level of anonymity journalists, whistleblowers, or ethical hackers aim for  where finding you takes real effort, not just Google.\n\nAs a beginner in cybersecurity, this topic excites me and freaks me out at the same time. Would love to hear realistic takes on what’s possible and where the limits are.",

What you can do is reduce noise and avoid triggering obvious alerts.\nA few important points:\nScanning all 65k ports right away is unnecessary and very loud. Start with common ports or --top-ports.\nICMP ping sweeps are often logged or blocked, so using -Pn is common in real pentests.\nSYN scans (-sS) are generally preferable to full TCP connect scans because they don’t complete the handshake.\nTiming matters a lot. Slower scans (-T2 or manual delays) are far less likely to trigger rate-based IDS rules.\nAvoid -A, version detection, and OS fingerprinting until you actually know which ports are open — those features generate a lot of extra traffic.\nOptions like fragmentation, decoys, or source-port tricks may confuse attribution or bypass very weak filters, but they don’t make you invisible and are often ineffective against modern IDS/IPS.\nIn practice, professional testers don’t aim for “stealth Nmap.” They do as much passive recon as possible first, then perform small, targeted, low-rate scans, and they assume defenders may still see the activity.",

I genuinely can’t take feeling this way anymore.\n\nI have already filed a police report, but so far it hasn’t led to anything. I’ve been told there’s not much they can do at this stage, which leaves me feeling helpless.\n\nI am French, in case that matters for legal or technical advice.\n\nI’m looking to speak with someone who is very skilled in computer science / cybersecurity / OSINT, who could help me understand how to identify who is behind this — legally — or how to set a trap to gather proof and protect myself. There is a real possibility that this person (or these people) could be from my own circle or someone who knows me in real life.\n\nThis situation is seriously affecting my mental health, and I feel very alone with it.\n\nI don’t want to share too many details publicly, but I am willing to give more information in private to someone trustworthy who believes they can help or guide me in the right direction.\n\nThank you for reading and for any help or advice.",

I have tried wifite and airodump-ng but with both I run into the same issue where I can hardly see any associated clients.\n\nI do see all the SSID's near me and under clients a lot of them show up but almost all of them are not assiociated with a wifi network. I am in the middle of the office surrounded by laptops and phones that are connected to our wifi.\n\nFor hardware I use a laptop with kali linux and I have tried Alfa AWUS036ACM and AWUS036AXM. The wifi adapter is in monitor mode.\n\nAny suggestions on what I could try to fix the issue where clients show as not associated to a wifi network?",

Alternatively if you don’t mind losing the data on the laptop just do a restore like someone already suggested. \nP.S. once your laptop is back in working order create a backup Administrator account that you don’t use, but it will serve as a backdoor account to do password resets if you ever find your self locked out again.\nGood Luck",
