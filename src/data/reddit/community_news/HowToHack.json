These will have an effect on how long it takes to scan a target.\n\nThe trick is understanding how the remote end detects these things. A firewall will (almost) always log a dropped packet, so even a slow scan will show up in logs. However, slow probing may not trigger IDPS that'll cause all packets/datagrams from your IP to be dropped regardless.",

What you can do is reduce noise and avoid triggering obvious alerts.\nA few important points:\nScanning all 65k ports right away is unnecessary and very loud. Start with common ports or --top-ports.\nICMP ping sweeps are often logged or blocked, so using -Pn is common in real pentests.\nSYN scans (-sS) are generally preferable to full TCP connect scans because they don’t complete the handshake.\nTiming matters a lot. Slower scans (-T2 or manual delays) are far less likely to trigger rate-based IDS rules.\nAvoid -A, version detection, and OS fingerprinting until you actually know which ports are open — those features generate a lot of extra traffic.\nOptions like fragmentation, decoys, or source-port tricks may confuse attribution or bypass very weak filters, but they don’t make you invisible and are often ineffective against modern IDS/IPS.\nIn practice, professional testers don’t aim for “stealth Nmap.” They do as much passive recon as possible first, then perform small, targeted, low-rate scans, and they assume defenders may still see the activity.",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am trying to do some security testing on our wifi networks. I have tried wifite and airodump-ng but with both I run into the same issue where I can hardly see any associated clients.\n\nI do see all the SSID's near me and under clients a lot of them show up but almost all of them are not assiociated with a wifi network. I am in the middle of the office surrounded by laptops and phones that are connected to our wifi.\n\nFor hardware I use a laptop with kali linux and I have tried Alfa AWUS036ACM and AWUS036AXM. The wifi adapter is in monitor mode.\n\nAny suggestions on what I could try to fix the issue where clients show as not associated to a wifi network?",

The payouts are also much lower for XSS.   \nFocus on higher ROI bugs, BAC, business logic, and race conditions. You may go longer between payouts but you'll make more money.",

It's like sports - top 0.001% make good money, rest won't.\n\n> XSS\n\nIt's the easiest to automate - it's client side, so the website just gives you the source code that you can analyze. Server-side vulnerabilities you often have to treat as blackbox and make very custom analysis of each target.\n\n> Broken Acces Control as it has the most ROI\n\nI wonder how you measured that. Because biggest payout doesn't mean big ROI - you have to divide the money by the amount of work. If it takes you a year or two to find a vuln, then even $100k payout might not be much.",

For the sake of the experiment and just for fun, I'm looking for a way to power it on without shorting the standard power button pads or using the physical flex cable.\nSince it's a MediaTek-based device, I was thinking about:\nVBUS / Auto-boot: Is there a known method to trigger a full boot via USB injection or by modifying the boot partition to bypass the charging animation?\nTest Points: Are there specific test points on this PCB that interact directly with the PMIC (Power Management IC) to signal a power-on event?\nADB/Fastboot: Since the device is currently off, I'm looking for a way to 'wake' the bootloader via hardware signals.\nI have a multimeter and a basic understanding of electronics. I'm NOT looking to bypass any FRP or locks—the device is mine—I just want to learn more about hardware triggering.\nAny insights on the schematics or MTK-specific boot triggers? Thanks",
