I've tried burp, 127.0.0.1, and basically any other host (HTTP or HTTPS) and I keep getting connection/security errors.\n\nThe strange part is that everything works fine in Firefox, I can hit 127.0.0.1:8080 without any issues. The proxy listener is definitely running on 127.0.0.1:8080, intercept is turned off, and I'm on the latest version of Burp Pro.\n\nI've already checked the obvious stuff:\n\n\\- Proxy listener is active and correctly bound to 127.0.0.1:8080\n\n\\- Intercept is disabled\n\n\\- Firefox connects to the listener just fine\n\n\\- Happens with plain HTTP too, so I don't think it's a cert issue\n\nI'm on macOS Sequoia 15.7.3 with the latest Burp Suite Professional using the embedded Chromium browser.\n\nAnyone run into something similar or have any ideas what might be going on ? Thank you in advance",
