      "text": "I showed up 10 minutes early, hoodie on, laptop in hand, booted into a hardened gentoo distro I compiled myself. She opened the door holding a MacBook Air. Chrome had 43 tabs open. I almost left right then.\n\nI asked for her network topology diagram. She laughed. “It’s just the router from the ISP.”  \nAlright, I thought. Let her have it.\n\nI popped open her router admin panel. Default password: *admin123*. The SSID was \"PrettyFlyForAWiFi\". I ran a `nmap`scan. 12 exposed ports, 3 outdated IoT devices, and a printer running telnet. No firewall. No VLANs. Just raw digital nudity.\n\nI asked if she ever noticed weird lag. She said “yeah sometimes Netflix buffers.” I said that was probably because her TV was being used in a botnet out of Kazakhstan. She blinked twice. \"Oh no, is that bad?\"\n\nI offered to segment the network and install pfSense. She said she “just wanted Spotify to stop cutting out.”\n\nI airgapped her Sonos out of pity.\n\nAfter 20 minutes of work, I asked for her phone to remove TikTok and clean the app permissions. She said “but I need it for filters.”  \nI looked into the distance. Deep sigh. I looked out the window and whispered, *\"The panopticon isn’t metaphorical.\"*  \nShe asked if I was always this intense.  \nI said no, only when the NSA is listening. Which is always.\n\nShe offered coffee. I declined, caffeine raises your attack surface.\n\nWhen I left, she said, “Thanks, you’re like, really good with computers.”\n\nI walked away slow. Her router was still on UPnP. So was my heart.  \nYou can't patch people. Believe me, I tried.\n\n  \n`// date_night_final_final_forsure.txt.gpg`  \n`#exit`",

          "text": "I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.\n\n“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”\n\n“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”\n\n“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”\n\nThe heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”\n\n“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”\n\n“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”\n\nHe laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”\n\n“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”\n\nI put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.\n\n“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.\n\n“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.\n\n“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”\n\nIt didn’t seem like they did.\n\n“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”\n\nNothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.\n\nI figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.\n\n“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.\n\nToo late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.\n\n“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.\n\nI was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”\n\nHe turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.\n\n“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”\n\n“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.\n\n“Because I was afraid.”\n\n“Afraid?”\n\n“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”\n\nI wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.\n\n“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”\n\nHe nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me.",

What you encountered isn't a static fake site. It’s an Adversary-in-the-Middle Reverse Proxy attack. Using tools like Evilginx2, attackers don't just mimic the site - they proxy it in real time.\n\nThe attacker's server sits between you and the real bank. When you type, it forwards your data to the legitimate server instantly. Because they are proxying the live session, even MFA (2FA codes) won't save you. They don't steal your password; they steal the Session Cookie after you've already authenticated. Once they have that, they are you.\n\nYou mentioned the URL looked perfect. Look closer. Using Punycode, attackers register domains with Cyrillic characters that are visually identical to Latin ones. To your browser, it's a completely different domain; to your eyes, it's a perfect match. The moment that session is intercepted, automated scripts take over. By the time your parents realize the page is loading slowly, their daily transfer limit has been bumped and the funds are already being routed to a new recipient.\n\nWe are in the era of automated session hijacking. If you aren't using hardware keys (FIDO2), you’re just a target waiting for the right link.\n\nStay paranoid!!!",

Personally, I started doing CTFs that only required a laptop (you can use any old laptop and install arch or a lightweight distro for that). After some time, i started learning on vulnhub vms. That was the moment when I started thinking of buying some new hardware. My laptop isn't really good at running 2 vms at the same time, so I bought a raspberry pi 5, paired with a UPS and a big fan, and that's what I use for \"hacking\" my vm.\n\nEverything you choose is up to you. If you are interested in RFID/NFC hacking, get a flipper zero. If you are interested in OS and wifi hacking, get a mini-computer + internet adapter that supports injection and monitor mode. It is very hard to give you a good example if I dont really know your interests. Please let me know\n\nPs: I am not a master, I know i was in your shoes one time, and this is what I concluded  (sorry for any bad English btw)\n\nHacking doesnt mean buying new \"hacking tools\". Hacking tools are mostly making it easier. When you learn, you should just get a laptop, as cheap as it can get, id say around 200-300$ is good. If you want to also buy a laptop that is a daily driver, even better. You can dual boot linux + windows. But if you already have a laptop somewhere, you dont need to buy another. Just use that one",

Start small.\n\nGet one or two of these:\n\n```\n□ESP32 or ESP8266 dev board\n□Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)\n□Old consumer IoT device you own\n```\n\nTools (over time, not all at once):\n\n```\n●USB-to-TTL adapter (CP2102 / CH340)\n●Logic analyzer (Saleae clone is fine)\n●Multimeter\n●SOIC clip (future you will thank you)\n```\nYou’re learning how devices talk, not how to “hack Wi-Fi.”\n\nFirmware workflow (high-level, no sketchy steps)\n\nA typical learning loop looks like:\n```\n●Identify chip(s)\n●Find datasheet\n●Locate debug interfaces (UART/JTAG/SWD)\n●Dump firmware\n●Analyze with tools (strings, Ghidra)\n●Modify your own devices\n```\n\nThis is engineering, not crime.

It’s about understanding systems so well that breaking them is trivial.\n\nIf you chase shortcuts, you’ll burn out. If you chase understanding, you’ll scare people (in a good way).\n\nYou don’t need to know everything. You just need to start one layer deeper than yesterday.\n\nWelcome to the rabbit hole 🐇",

If you have or can obtain an android device (phone or tablet) and purchase Cactus Whid Wifi Hid Injector . Install the Whid apk on the tablet or phone and insert the dongle into the laptop. Basically you are learning Ducky Script on your android device to drop payloads onto your laptop. You can go to https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/duckyscript-quick-reference/ . So the issue with Cactus Whid WiFi Hid Injector the dongle itself can be a fake depending on where you purchase it from and I don’t know a dedicated website that sells them. A more expensive option is flipper zero, where you can run ducky script on their version of badusb but this doesn’t require a phone or tablet you just connect the type C cable from the flipper zero to the laptop but you’ll need to write your scripts/payloads using windows notepad and inserting the txt.file into the flipper zero badusb folder . The point is learning to write Ducky Script  to inject payloads to navigate through windows file system , batch , or notepad loops , without touching the laptop keyboard. Once you’ve got a hand of writing ducky script then you can run virtual machine add Kali OS (because it already has Bluetooth tools installed) and install and run Blueducky . Blueducky is not the greatest on picking up devices but if you have a tv that has Bluetooth most likely Blue-ducky will pick it up and now you can run your payloads to the Tv or anything Bluetooth related . Once you’ve come accustomed to ducky script and Blueducky you can run Blueducky on a dedicated Linux tablets or phone. What’s lame is the company that made Pinephone doesn’t make phones anymore they make tablets the PineTab at $160 & $210  then there’s the company Purism Librem 5 phone at $800 . So long story short,  running Blueducky on a Linux phone is the closest anyone will get to be Marcus Holloway and Aiden Pearce from the Watch Dogs series to commandeer any if not all bluetooth devices using Blueducky . But like anything hacking related , one must learn what kind of target they are hacking.",

I am starting fresh. I have the computer for it, kali linux downloaded, and besides that, ready to obsess over this shit.

There's also help desk roles that aren't face to face which may be more tenable for you.\n\nIf college is out of the question, you should study for some certificates, whether you take the test or not, the study material is helpful to know what kind of things to learn.

          "text": "I'm a senior penetration tester for a large financial company in the US. This is my personal opinion and is solely based off how I got to where I am.\n\nWhen I first knew I wanted to go into offensive security I had a mentor stress the importance of both \"Performance Based\" and \"Objective Based Learning\"\n\nPerformance Based - I did something hands on keyboard and was able to learn something from it.\n\nObjective Based - I passed a multiple choice test with x amount of questions and met the objectives required to pass.\n\nIf you have one without the other you may find gaps in your knowledge. Keep this in mind when you are looking at obtaining certifications. Stick to the ones that are accredited if you are wanting an employer to notice them at all.\n\nI would skip eJPTv2 if you are already CCNA level and hop to HackTheBox & TryHackMe boxes. If you can finish a few boxes a week for a year you are in a decent spot. Then start studying for OSCP by doing TJ Nulls HTB list and start doing the HTB and THM practice networks.\n\nGoing through the material of OSCP will be a great foundation then you should go through OSEP, CRTO, eCPPTv2, or eWPTv2. These will give you deeper understandings of different things you may run into on internal engagements.\n\nTopics to especially pay attention to.\n\nScanning/Enumerating - Networks > Hosts > Services > Versions > Vulnerabilities > Exploits\n\nExploiting - MITM (ESPECIALLY RELAYS), Roasting Attacks, Password Spraying, MITM over IPv6, General Windows Exploitation & Priv Esc.\n\nActive Directory - OU's, DNS, GPO's, Trusts, ADCS, ADSync, Ticket Forgery, Special Privs & Perms (Bloodhound/Powerview), WSUS, SCCM, gMSA, Delegation Attacks, etc.\n\nPost Exploitation - DUMP EVERYTHING, Mimikatz, SAM, SECURITY, SYSTEM, NTDS.dit, LSA Secrets.\n\nTo sum it up - Do a LOT of THM and HTB get a LOT of certs and document everything you learn in your second brain (One Note, Gitbook , Notion, etc) If you don't enjoy the struggle of the things Ive noted in this comment you probably will want to pivot to something else besides pentesting.\n\nThe field is pretty hard to get into still so if you want to stand out > STAND OUT. Build the most impressive resume that if they didn't accept you they would be stupid. EXP > Degrees > Certs > Trainings\n\nBest\n\n  \n(Edit for reporting)\n\nTalk to people like they are people. They need to understand what you are saying so don't be super technical. Include different sections in your report for the different audiences that will be reading your report. Technicals and non-technicals. Include a narrative, explain where how they did and where they should be and why. What, Why, How > why should we do this and How should we do it. \n\nDon't give someone a 2000 page PDF... Ain't no one going to read that crap. Split it up into bite sized pieces and don't just dump nessus scans into your report and call it a pentest or used some AI crap to do the pentest for you.",

I understand that , it can not really be free , because of the amount of resources involved. ( i even got to know that people prefer VPS for bug bounty or ethical hacking as well instead of local machine).\n\nSo my Question is , What are differences b/w the famous hosting services and If i want to start myself , which hosting service should i use/invest in ? that is affordable for a student and beginner like me , and has option for different types of resources to host (Windows, ubuntu, kali , Windows Server etc ) as well. \n\nAnd is there any alternative way ? , since it is going to be slightly expensive for me at this point , but i really don't  want to miss/compromise on \"Practical\" side of the learning , i really want to understand the systems completely , but at least there should be some system available in front of me as well.",

Factory reset, safe mode, flashing firmware, using USB devices to flash to, or paying someone who specializes in removing MDM will not work to remove the MDM lock from the device. The original organization has to unenroll the mobile device. This practice is typical in the case of enterprise-grade Mobile Device Management solutions used in the healthcare industry, and even well-known platforms such as AppTec360 or any other enterprise Mobility Device Management (MDM) platform will have been designed for that purpose, to enforce and maintain control of the devices rather than enable ways to bypass the control.

One, her Facebook account was locked due to suspicious activity, and two, and alert of a suspicious sign-in into that same email account (Microsoft). Of course I immediately helped her change her passwords. I thought that was it, but the next day we discover that someone has posted something strange on her Instagram story, so we change that password too. Then today, same with her LinkedIn! Someone signed her up for premium and started sending dozens of recruitment messages to random people. Changed that password too.\n\nI'm going to help her enable two-factor authentication today. But I'd like to know how they got in. She knows about phishing and to not click weird links, I've taught her a decent amount about internet safety as far as I was aware. She says she did not go onto any strange sites, and she regularly scans her computer with malwarebytes.\n\nWas there a Microsoft data breach? Her passwords were all decently secure so I don't know if they were brute forced or gathered from some sort of data breach. She does travel a lot, but her last time in an airport was November, so I don't know if the attack could have been through public wifi, if it took this long for them to do anything? Unless it was through a vulnerable public wifi in a shopping centre? She didn't go shopping on the day that the attack happened though.\n\nI'd be happy to answer any questions to help get to the bottom of this. I want to be able to understand this better and help prevent it in the future. I genuinely thought I understood hacking better than this, but I am clearly a bit of a noob.",

          "text": "It would be speculation for anybody to provide anything conclusive without being able to have direct access to the computer and piece together an assessment.\n\nIt could be an infostealer. What you mentioned is very common with infostealers.  \nThe malware targets valuable data on the computer and then sends it back to the criminals.  \nYour mothers accounts don't need to be hacked because the malware steals the browser data that allows access to the accounts from the browser.   \nWhen you login to a website you save data on your browser that is provided to the site when you visit it again. This is usually in the form of cookies. A cookie is a small amount of information that can be accessed by the website that set the cookie. Websites often use cookies for authentication (logging on and confirming the user successfully did this so they don't have to do it again). Nothing can access the cookie except the site that set it. \n\nThat is unless a hacker targets the computer and steals the cookie. If they can do this, they can steal the authentication that was granted to the user who logged into that account. They are basically impersonating the user and stealing their permission to access the site. They don't need to pass 2FA because 2FA comes during the authentication and not afterwards. When you pass 2FA you demonstrate you are allowed to access that account and the cookie is set. Access granted. \n\nMany websites are changing the way they do authentication. As a full stack web developer myself I avoid relying solely on cookie based authentication and use a mix of client-side and server-side authentication. This limits the reliance on client-side methods for confirming the legitimacy of the session and puts more weight on the server to do this although mitigating for session fixation attacks and other things is necessary on the server-side too. A good example is using server-side session state management and from there you can control the session independent of whether the cookie is set or not. You can confirm whether the IP address matches the one that logged in, how much time has elapsed since logging in, how many sessions you want a single user to have (1, 10, 100 etc), you can perform browser fingerprinting and match patterns and see whether over time those patterns align. A good example here is if a hacker uses Google Chrome and you've always used Mozilla Firefox that will flag on the back end and you can take some form of action to protect the account. This is fundamentally a shift in a positive direction because traditional authentication has security flaws. Gone are the days where a simple cookie is enough to confirm you are who you say you are! Ideally, a website should store next to no data on the client-side (browser) to prevent exactly these problems but the changes are slow primarily unfortunately, primarily because changes like this mean the fundamental infrastructure has to change as well. \n\nThere are other possibilities. Browser extensions can be malicious. Because they get access to the activity in the browser (and not just a single tab) they can oversee everything. This is great for functionality and why extensions are so useful but it can also make them backdoors in their own right. Extensions have the ability to connect out to the internet. How do you know what is being sent from your browser? You would need to go into developer mode on your browser and start reading through lines of Javascript in that extension and start looking for fetch/axios/XHR activity. You will be surprised how much data is collected by seemingly benign extensions! If you have 20 extensions in your browser, that's 20 potential backdoors, particularly if you use extensions that are potentially shady (and many are). \n\nAnother possibility. Data breaches. Sites get hacked all the time, including big sites. Do you use the same password over multiple sites? Do you reuse old passwords? That will be surely make for an unhappy day.  \n  \nPublic networks can be an issue too. By default most Windows computers are set to make a lot of noise when they connect to a network. This is both for convenience and compatibility. This noise can be picked up by anyone listening on the wire. You can do a lot to reduce this noise (disable SMB, printer, RDP, netbios, several tweaks to reduce discovery, prevent poisoning attacks, firewall rules to block certain ports etc and ensure firewall is enabled for all zones) but public networks will always be a big risk. You can connect to a seemingly legitimate network (Starbucks) and it is a rogue AP that is performing MITM attacks.",

And she only takes her cellphone out of the house, not her laptop. Would a delay between them gaining the info and actually breaching the accountd be normal or purposeful in this case?\n\nI just find all of this strange; they made no attempt to lock my mother out of her accounts, changing the passwords was simple, she was still logged in and could just go into account settings. They only used her LinkedIn and Instagram like I mentioned in the post.

                  "text": "The cookie is often the session token.  \nCookies persist between sessions and that's why when you close a typical browser and then re-open it, you are still logged in. It is the cookie that tells the website you have already authenticated. Depending on what they do on the back-end (more lax security or more tight) they will perform a variety (or minimal) actions. More secure sites won't rely solely on the cookie but will do some comparative analysis between previous sessions as well as look at the client connecting etc. Multiple sessions can be a concern especially from different IP addresses simultaneously but even this is hard to implement as a security feature because legitimate use also may involve using different computer, browsers and different IP addresses. Some less secure sites will just accept the cookie and you're logged in.\n\nThere are other methods like JWT which don't rely on cookies and instead creates a token based on a secret key that exists on the server. All tokens are derived from that secret key and prove validity because they can be encrypted/decrypted and match the expected value. More accurately they are not actually encrypted at all but use hashing algorithms but these are pretty strong in most cases, when using an algo that hasn't been cracked and a secret key that is strong enough.\n\nYes, this would be fairly standard fingerprinting checks. A history of browsers that have been used to access the site are recorded and then compared over time. Not just browsers but IP addresses too and any other identifiable information. Over time, you tend to create reliable patterns and when these deviate, it's usually indication of a potential compromise. As for the IP address, it would be hard to determine if this was the true IP address as criminals usually hide their IP address. They can do this by hacking someone's computer and then conducting illegal activity through that, or using a VPN, Tor etc.\n\nThe delay could be meaningful although it's likely just down to order of business on the day. Infostealers can collect A LOT of information. The big ones are MULTI-MILLION dollar enterprises and they are run through sophisticated multi-layered multi-tiered infrastructure. You could get compromised minutes, hours, weeks or months afterwards. It's also worth noting they probably didn't breach the account. They probably stole session data which means they didn't need to breach anything. A breach would imply coercion in some way but with most infostealers they go for the browser data itself which bypasses any need for coercion. They get the keys to the vault without needing to break in. It's one of the oldest and still most effective methods for walking straight into someone's account. All you need to do (literally) is export the browser data from where it is installed to another browser and you impersonate the session that was initially created on the first browser without needing to do anything else. Try it on a website you visit that you have an account for. Copy the cookie data from one browser to the browser on another computer and you should be able to access the account without needing to login!\n\nThe lack of overtly destructive actions is probably damage limitation. The less attention drawn to the criminals the more likely their crimes will slip under the radar and while illegal, they are far more likely to continue by not doing blatantly destructive things and so their actions are often strategic and balanced. Gone are the days where someone hacks a company and spreads a virus that deletes all data because that makes a lot of noise and can cause serious disruption which is far more likely to get the attention of the law than if they discretely (yet illegally) conduct their activities. It's all about plausible deniability and sculpting a timeline of events that minimizes attribution. Most criminals in this area want to be invisible not the other way round. If they hacked social media accounts and began posting recruitment content, they were likely propagating their malicious campaign to as many more victims as possible while using the credibility of a legitimate social media account.\n\nI have personally analyzed malware of similar characteristics and I would agree on your observation about professionalism. A lot of malware many people come into contact with is moderately sophisticated. Intermediate level understanding of Windows internals and a programming language that is fairly low level will gift you the ability to make malware. Some maldevs copy code that others have made, or piggyback on their malware with their own. 6-12 months of solid learning will attain most with the level (assuming you have previous programming experience) to make half-decent half-effective malware. It's also not necessarily the sophistication of the malware but the infrastructure behind it. How much money can they make? How quickly can they recover from a server shutdown? How fast can they move on to the next campaign? The goal isn't necessarily to be an elite level hacker - that's often for APTs/nation state threat actors whose goals align with attacking an entire country's critical infrastructure. Everyday malware, if this term exists, is exactly that - it works for the moment and then the next it doesn't and then it moves on.\n\nThanks for the thought provoking questions!",

I believe this is the right place to ask, since my goal is to understand how these devices expose video streams and how they can be analyzed.\n\nI have a Wi-Fi security camera that I access using the Yoose app. It’s not from a well-known Brazilian brand like Intelbras, so I assume it’s a generic Chinese camera.\n\nI’ve read that most IP cameras expose a RTSP stream, which can be accessed using tools like VLC and later processed with OpenCV for real-time image analysis.\n\nActually, I have:\n\n* The camera’s local IP address\n* Tested several common RTSP URL patterns I found online\n* Tried accessing them through VLC Media Player\n\nUnfortunately, none of the RTSP URL formats I tested worked\n\n  \nTrying it, I have some questions:\n\n1. Do all cameras actually expose an RTSP stream?\n2. Is it common for cameras that rely on proprietary apps (like Yoose) to block or hide RTSP?\n3. Are there known techniques or tools to discover RTSP endpoints on these devices (without modifying firmware)?\n\nI'm sorry if this post is confused, if you after read that have some question, please tell to me, so I will explain it better.",
