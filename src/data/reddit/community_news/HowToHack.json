I know the rules say no personal vendettas but I am not trying to snoop or get revenge, I just want his memories. Because this wasn’t expected, he left his phone behind and nobody knows his password. I just want into his phone because he had a lot of selfies and pictures I’d really like access to. The phone is an android celero5g. And I know most photos are backed up on Google photos but my dad was old so he used Yahoo. Whatever Gmail is tied to the phone we don’t know what it is me ",

As a test, I tried hacking [https://demo.testfire.net/login.jsp](https://demo.testfire.net/login.jsp), which is a site created to let hackers test things such as SQL injections and other stuff. I know that the correct username for this website is \"admin\" and the correct password is \"admin\". I tried to use Hydra to test this, but Hydra finds every single password I put correct even when they're not. And if I use a success criterion instead of a failure criteria it finds every single password wrong.\n\nI have no idea why it is not working, and neither does Google. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThis is the command that I'm using:\n\nhydra -f -vV \\\\ -l Admin \\\\ -p Admin \\\\ [demo.testfire.net](http://demo.testfire.net) \\\\ https-post-form \"/login.jsp:uid=\\^USER\\^&passw=\\^PASS\\^&btnSubmit=Login:F=Login Failed\"\n\nBy the way, I am running Kali Linux in Virtualbox if that changes anything",

It never finds the \"Login Failed\" because you're not using the correct URL for your request. See, in the network you'll see the endpoint you're meant to send the payload to isn't /login.jsp but instead /doLogin. It is then redirected to login.jsp",

Like if one was playing miniplanet years ago, and wanted to stop themselves from getting kicked out of a house by another player, they would record themselves being kicked using wpe. Then edit the packets content. Usually an obvious word like “kick” and nullify it. These days, everything is encrypted, or from what I read, must pass the games server before going to the client, or another client. That’s me putting it in my newbie terms. I’ve played around with fiddler, don’t know how to do anything like this. Any help on how to do this? ",

          "text": "It really depends. There are hundreds of different scenarios involving cloning and even more different ways to hack into devices. The exact circumstances you're in will define which you should go for and why. \n\nGenerally, hacking into a device is more fragile. The exploit might not work well, it might get detected and blocked, it might not survive long enough until disruption (update, restart, etc.), or it might be very difficult or impossible with your knowledge at the time.\n\n  \nCloning, on the other hand, is typically a simpler and more stable process. You can clone a device, then explore it offline anywhere. Sometimes you can clone it in a way that lets you still see some future activity and often even interact with it. It is, however, more limited. First, it typically requires more access to what you're cloning, either in terms of information or physically. Second, you can only explore the information you cloned, plus whatever accesses are still available and possible to use from the existing sessions. This means you could for example still see someone's email or messages, but you cannot see other future activity like him logging into his bank account after you clone it.   \n  \nBottom line is, in very general terms, cloning a device is easier but requires more access and is more limited in what it gives you access to. Hacking into a device is more fragile, more things can go wrong, and it's noisier, but it allows you to have better control and more power to do a lot more. One isn't better than the other, they're simply two ways to obtain overlapping but different kinds of information and access. They're both useful, depending on the situation. ",

If we're talking only about cloning, then what we would do is set up an app with a similar domain or name, and replicate how that portal looks completely. This wouldn't affect the real portal, we would just have a clone of that real portal, but it's effectively a different portal, one only we control. \n\nWe would have to get whoever we wanted to \"attack\" or trick, to use OUR portal instead of the real one. Since we control our portal we can show whatever we want. We can't, however, make any changes to the real portal. \n\nIf we want to make changes to the real portal we need to hack into it, not just clone it. \n\nCloning usually only allows us to make changes or have access to information on the real apps/devices in very specific scenarios. For example, cloning a phone completely or a computer, which contains all the logged-in sessions. In this case we could still use those sessions, if they were valid, hence being able to see or change the real accounts/systems. \n\nIn the scenario you presented, the only cloning we could do would be to replicate the portal as our own portal, without being able to touch the real one. If you wanted to affect the real one you'd have to hack into a device that has administrative access to the portal, or hack into the servers hosting the portal, or hack into the databases/backend connected to that portal.\n\nBottom line, yea your full scenario is possible, but not through cloning alone. \n\nHope it helped :D  \n",
