When they redacted it, they just drew black boxes over it but never got rid of that text metadata, so you could just copy-paste it.\n\nA common thing you see on social media is someone will take a screenshot and edit the picture on their phone to redact information. Sometimes, the default pencil tool in that app is only set to 80% opacity, which means if you increase the contrast of the image (or in some cases, turn your brightness up), you can see the text below it.\n\nThose are two very common examples with methods that are completely different, because they were \"done wrong\" in different ways.",

(not to mention, there's no way to skip through the song list. if i want a song starting with the letter G, i sit there for several minutes scrolling manually through every single one A-F first.)\n\ni'm looking to hack/jailbreak the mp3 player so i can poke through the code and hopefully add some features. namely, i just want to be able to add a song to a given folder from the song menu. it doesn't seem that complicated? idk i could be wrong. could anyone help out, or maybe point me in the right direction if this isn't the proper sub for this sort of thing? it would be much appreciated!",

In the past, copying and importing cookie data (for example via browser tools or extensions) between accounts sometimes allowed a session to be reused. This behavior worked for a while, but no longer does.\n\nPreviously, I built a small tool to **analyze session identifiers present in cookies** for research purposes, mainly to understand how session invalidation, binding, and rotation were implemented. I’d typically export cookies in JSON format and observe how modern platforms handled them when environments or accounts changed.\n\nNow that this approach no longer works, I’m trying to understand **what changes were introduced on the security side**—for example, whether it’s due to stricter session binding, device fingerprinting, token rotation, SameSite/HttpOnly flags, or server‑side validation improvements.\n\nDoes anyone have insight into which defensive mechanisms are now preventing session reuse, or what best practices platforms currently use to mitigate this class of issue? And also, if you know this thing can be bypassed, let me know.",

Same cookie from another browser, machine, or network gets flagged or invalidated.\n\nTokens rotate fast and are killed on context change or parallel use.\n\nHttpOnly and SameSite are not the reason. Those only stop JS and CSRF, not replay.\n\nAss line: copying cookies fails because you’re missing most of the session context.
