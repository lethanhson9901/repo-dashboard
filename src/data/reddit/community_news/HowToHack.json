There are still practical scenarios where people will glue queries by hand, and a lot of frameworks don't really provide any assistance. Prepared statements prevent injection in the parameter values, so your classic `'or '1'='1` won't work but there can be other scenarios.\n\nLet me give a real-life example: Imagine that you want to query only selected columns from the db, based on the user input (so you want to do `select a,b from table` or `select c,d from table` if whichever columns were requested). You could argue that one can simply `select *` and then filter out the requested values from the results, but for column databases that would be a huge waste, because you'd be reading columns you don't need. Even worse for something like AWS Athena or GCP Big Query where you literally pay based on how much data was scanned, so you really want to touch only things you actually need. You can't use parametrized queries or prepared statements for this. There are a few \"frameworks\" that actually provide means to do this safely (for example jOOQ and QueryDSL), but many mainstream solutions don't, and I've seen people gluing those strings manually ;)",

I've tried burp, 127.0.0.1, and basically any other host (HTTP or HTTPS) and I keep getting connection/security errors.\n\nThe strange part is that everything works fine in Firefox, I can hit 127.0.0.1:8080 without any issues. The proxy listener is definitely running on 127.0.0.1:8080, intercept is turned off, and I'm on the latest version of Burp Pro.\n\nI've already checked the obvious stuff:\n\n\\- Proxy listener is active and correctly bound to 127.0.0.1:8080\n\n\\- Intercept is disabled\n\n\\- Firefox connects to the listener just fine\n\n\\- Happens with plain HTTP too, so I don't think it's a cert issue\n\nI'm on macOS Sequoia 15.7.3 with the latest Burp Suite Professional using the embedded Chromium browser.\n\nAnyone run into something similar or have any ideas what might be going on ?
