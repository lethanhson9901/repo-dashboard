      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nAs I’m learning cybersecurity, I’m slowly realizing how much we’re tracked online, and honestly it’s messing with my head. It feels like every click, search, and action is being watched not just data breaches, but the whole internet model itself.\n\nI really value privacy and love the idea of digital anonymity. I know 100% anonymity isn’t possible (especially if governments get involved), but that’s not what I’m asking.\n\nWhat I want to know is:\n\nHow anonymous can a normal person realistically get?\n\nHow many layers can we hide behind?\n\nHow hard can we make it for OSINT or basic tracking to identify us?\n\n\nI don’t want my entire digital life popping up just because someone searched my name. I’m curious about the level of anonymity journalists, whistleblowers, or ethical hackers aim for  where finding you takes real effort, not just Google.\n\nAs a beginner in cybersecurity, this topic excites me and freaks me out at the same time. Would love to hear realistic takes on what’s possible and where the limits are.",

There are also mixnets, that can make it harder for correlating time of sent and received data but correct me if I’m wrong, I think mixnets can only be used for the sending and receiving of slow email type messages to others on a mixnet.

I genuinely can’t take feeling this way anymore.\n\nI have already filed a police report, but so far it hasn’t led to anything. I’ve been told there’s not much they can do at this stage, which leaves me feeling helpless.\n\nI am French, in case that matters for legal or technical advice.\n\nI’m looking to speak with someone who is very skilled in computer science / cybersecurity / OSINT, who could help me understand how to identify who is behind this — legally — or how to set a trap to gather proof and protect myself. There is a real possibility that this person (or these people) could be from my own circle or someone who knows me in real life.\n\nThis situation is seriously affecting my mental health, and I feel very alone with it.\n\nI don’t want to share too many details publicly, but I am willing to give more information in private to someone trustworthy who believes they can help or guide me in the right direction.\n\nThank you for reading and for any help or advice.",

Alternatively if you don’t mind losing the data on the laptop just do a restore like someone already suggested. \nP.S. once your laptop is back in working order create a backup Administrator account that you don’t use, but it will serve as a backdoor account to do password resets if you ever find your self locked out again.\nGood Luck",

The payouts are also much lower for XSS.   \nFocus on higher ROI bugs, BAC, business logic, and race conditions. You may go longer between payouts but you'll make more money.",
