Even good ones who study up and use tools and techniques developed by others need to apply what they learn and pivot cleverly as they work to be effective. Public perception is based on the media so many think all hackers are geniuses while most low tier ones are less clever than an average skilled burglar. But saying the people developing tools and selling kits that are causing mass financial suffering aren't at least pretty intelligent sounds crazy to me.",

A chef creates from nothing. It requires intricate knowledge of the tools and resources and techniques available. Creating their own methods and techniques, and discovering new ways to do things.\n\nSimilar as a \"script kiddie\" and a \"hacker\" (e.g. security researchers, exploit developers etc...).\n\nOne uses pre-defined tools and methods, the other creates them.\n\nYou can't study what doesn't yet exist. Top-tier hackers are looking for 0-days. Bugs/exploits that don't yet exist. You can't read a book thet tells you how to find them. It requires deep knowledge and understanding of multiple layers of code, frameworks and technologies. Often down to a machine-level for those more serious about it. You're mentally processing memory dumps, assembly, and forming a complex model of the environment in your head. It often requires very deep analytics occuring up in the grey matter. A top-tier hacker is up against potentially hundreds of very intelligent software and security engineers designing ways to stop them.",

I have been \"retired\" but spent years and years finding exploits for US Samsung devices (root exploits and bootloader exploits) that didn't exist yet. Had to constantly stay up on Android/Samsung security, had to know the ins and outs of pretty much everything involved from hardware, software, processors, kernels, bootloaders etc. etc. I retired myself when it wasn't fun anymore lol.. Was nice though getting paid for bug bounties. I would report the major exploits to Samsung. Root exploits I would release publicly because that was the whole reason I got into it in the first place, because Samsung and the US carriers lock the bootloaders on US devices. I was surprised at how horrible the security was back then. Like having the bootloader root the device on startup simply by changing prop setting 😅. It was ranked critical and I got like 5k for that one lol.",

      "text": "Recently, I met a cybersecurity professional who suggested that I use a Kali Linux live USB. I thought it was a great idea because running Kali directly from a live pendrive allows the system to use my hardware resources (especially RAM) more efficiently.\n\nSo, I switched to a live-booted pendrive. However, after doing this, I started facing an issue: when I use Kali Linux from the live USB, my internet speed becomes extremely slow—it feels like it’s running at a turtle’s pace. But when I run Kali Linux inside VirtualBox on Windows, the internet works perfectly fine and is very fast.\n\nI’m confused about why this is happening and how to fix the slow internet issue on live-booted Kali. Can you please help me resolve this?",

I've tried burp, 127.0.0.1, and basically any other host (HTTP or HTTPS) and I keep getting connection/security errors.\n\nThe strange part is that everything works fine in Firefox, I can hit 127.0.0.1:8080 without any issues. The proxy listener is definitely running on 127.0.0.1:8080, intercept is turned off, and I'm on the latest version of Burp Pro.\n\nI've already checked the obvious stuff:\n\n\\- Proxy listener is active and correctly bound to 127.0.0.1:8080\n\n\\- Intercept is disabled\n\n\\- Firefox connects to the listener just fine\n\n\\- Happens with plain HTTP too, so I don't think it's a cert issue\n\nI'm on macOS Sequoia 15.7.3 with the latest Burp Suite Professional using the embedded Chromium browser.\n\nAnyone run into something similar or have any ideas what might be going on ? Thank you in advance",

      "text": "Hello, I am fairly new to the world of cybersecurity and pentesting. I have an ALFA NETWORK wifi adapter with the AWUSO36ACS chip, it works well for penetration testing, supports monitor mode, packet injection, etc.\n\nBut as you already know, for Evil Twin with deauthentication, two Wi-Fi adapters are needed or the adapter has two physical radios.\n\nI thought about buying the same wifi adapter again but I want a more powerful option so to speak and also one that has good controllers, stability and range.I've been searching and I think I found three good options on Amazon\n\n1. ALFA AC1900 WiFi Adapter – 1900Mbps 802.11ac Long Range USB 3.0 Wi-Fi Network Adapter with 4 External 5dBi Dual Band Antennas, TAA Compliant\n2. Alfa AWUS036ACHM 802.11ac WiFi Range Boost Adaptador USB\n3. 【New version type C USB WiFi】 ALFA AWUS036ACH Long-range AC1200 dual-band wireless Wi-Fi adapter with 2 external 5dBi antennas - 2.4GHz 300Mbps/5GHz 867Mbps - 802.11ac and A, B, G,\n\nAll three have almost the same style, the main visual difference is the antennas\n\nmy questions are:\n\n* Which of the 3 should be or is better for pentesting, injection, stability, etc?\n* Do the extra antennas of each model (1) (2) (4) have any advantages?\n* Are there WiFi adapters that have 2 or more PHYSICAL radios?\n* Are there better WiFi adapters on the market for more or less the same price?\n* Some of these adapters have a version that integrates 6ghz Wi-Fi. It is useful or it is advisable to have 3 bands for pentesting and/or security testing of Wi-Fi networks.?\n\nhank you, I look forward to your responses and contributions.",
