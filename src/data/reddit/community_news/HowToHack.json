There are still practical scenarios where people will glue queries by hand, and a lot of frameworks don't really provide any assistance. Prepared statements prevent injection in the parameter values, so your classic `'or '1'='1` won't work but there can be other scenarios.\n\nLet me give a real-life example: Imagine that you want to query only selected columns from the db, based on the user input (so you want to do `select a,b from table` or `select c,d from table` if whichever columns were requested). You could argue that one can simply `select *` and then filter out the requested values from the results, but for column databases that would be a huge waste, because you'd be reading columns you don't need. Even worse for something like AWS Athena or GCP Big Query where you literally pay based on how much data was scanned, so you really want to touch only things you actually need. You can't use parametrized queries or prepared statements for this. There are a few \"frameworks\" that actually provide means to do this safely (for example jOOQ and QueryDSL), but many mainstream solutions don't, and I've seen people gluing those strings manually ;)",

It never finds the \"Login Failed\" because you're not using the correct URL for your request. See, in the network you'll see the endpoint you're meant to send the payload to isn't /login.jsp but instead /doLogin. It is then redirected to login.jsp",

      "text": "What’s up guys. I’m not very well versed in packet editing. But back in the day, when editing packets in games. It was as easy as editing what is from my understanding “not encrypted”. Like if one was playing miniplanet years ago, and wanted to stop themselves from getting kicked out of a house by another player, they would record themselves being kicked using wpe. Then edit the packets content. Usually an obvious word like “kick” and nullify it. These days, everything is encrypted, or from what I read, must pass the games server before going to the client, or another client. That’s me putting it in my newbie terms. I’ve played around with fiddler, don’t know how to do anything like this. Any help on how to do this? ",

It's also rare for there to be the old-school game host that everyone in a match connects to directly. Game companies, at least AAA ones, will protect user privacy.",
