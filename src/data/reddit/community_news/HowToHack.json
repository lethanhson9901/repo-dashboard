When they redacted it, they just drew black boxes over it but never got rid of that text metadata, so you could just copy-paste it.\n\nA common thing you see on social media is someone will take a screenshot and edit the picture on their phone to redact information. Sometimes, the default pencil tool in that app is only set to 80% opacity, which means if you increase the contrast of the image (or in some cases, turn your brightness up), you can see the text below it.\n\nThose are two very common examples with methods that are completely different, because they were \"done wrong\" in different ways.",

So plug into PC is out of the questions. Now android devices are not really my thing so im not sure how to go about this.\n\nAlso yes im aware saying its android is like asking how long a piece of string is. Id even happy take a Samsung from Period A to B is possible but period C to D is not. \n\nIs there any other ways (other than brute forcing the pin) to gain access to this device? if someone could point me in the direction of legitimate software, work arounds etc. Or is this likely to require a professional.   \n\nagain i apologize for lack of pre research etc. \n\nThanks. \n\n",

There are more modern stacks I'm sure, but in 1999 I was doing some self stjdy/research into how I might be able to leverage other computers to do stuff like crack encryption and hash tables and other things I will stay mum on. But, point is a couple of years later when I was brought as specialist at an executive protection agency as an EP agent and THE investigative agent for the digital domain (was just the first hire that had an IT background) one of the ways I got some serious points with the boss and the owner was creating the Beowulf cluster in a proper environment complete with Diskless Booting Linux via triggering reboots after sending a command to the dhcp server in the corporate network. The dhcp would point all new dhcp requests to the rftp server which served up a pxe image, in turn serving up DBlinux and the Linux image that was booted immediately would start up  Beowulf nodes on all workstations and the cluster command nodes would start serving up jobs, distributing workloads to crack the passwords of targets whose personal files we'd obtained an needed to open to continue forensics on, as well as the occasional target:s system that may or may not have had logins that miiiight have been eventually accessed via passwords that were obtained... No further comment, but I hope this was, while long winded, at least somewhat helpful as an example of one of the ways you can leverage the cloud or any group of heteregenous hardware across any span of distance to accomplish a task like what you mentioned. If the tooling yiu are using to accomplish a crack are parallel and hopefully capable of distributed processing, you're golden.",
