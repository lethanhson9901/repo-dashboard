When they redacted it, they just drew black boxes over it but never got rid of that text metadata, so you could just copy-paste it.\n\nA common thing you see on social media is someone will take a screenshot and edit the picture on their phone to redact information. Sometimes, the default pencil tool in that app is only set to 80% opacity, which means if you increase the contrast of the image (or in some cases, turn your brightness up), you can see the text below it.\n\nThose are two very common examples with methods that are completely different, because they were \"done wrong\" in different ways.",

(not to mention, there's no way to skip through the song list. if i want a song starting with the letter G, i sit there for several minutes scrolling manually through every single one A-F first.)\n\ni'm looking to hack/jailbreak the mp3 player so i can poke through the code and hopefully add some features. namely, i just want to be able to add a song to a given folder from the song menu. it doesn't seem that complicated? idk i could be wrong. could anyone help out, or maybe point me in the right direction if this isn't the proper sub for this sort of thing? it would be much appreciated!",

      "text": "Hi, i hope everything is doing great, im writing this, for people who are curious and want to know more about how we got a cyber attack.\n\nRecently we got an attack to almost all of our servers, since im not in the network/security team i don't know much details about how they got in, the only thing i know is that they used port 5432 which is for the postgres database, somehow they got in and they executed a query command that creates file and implant a malware script *(again i don't know too much how they did it)* the surprise thing is that all our networks are local we are blocking everything with iptables except our company's ips.\n\nanyways let go to the good stuff ...\n\na friend of mine in the network team sent me the script that got installed in one of the servers(i begged him for the script), its a shell based script.  \nsince im a programmer ... i coulnd't stop myself from analyse it and see what it does.  \nand i found that this script is soo damn charming, i like how the script is made and how it thought about every single piece.\n\nthe script idk if its was manual or he used an **Obfuscator** tool *(like we call it in our world, im a dev btw)*, everything was written in gibberish names, but i didn't really care tbh, the script was simple and direct, but smart, i knew that it is not made by AI or by someone who is good at programming because he made some structure/duplication mistakes, but it was genius how the script works !\n\nthe goal of the script was simply, is to download the true malware and execute it !  \nthe way how he does it, is fascinating\\*(at least for me)\\*.\n\ni will give an overview how the scripts works *(for the people who's lazy to read the script otherwise i will provide the script but i will comment the whole content)*\n\nPS :  please be careful i still don't know what the malware do, so don't execute it !\n\nso the script start by :\n\n* redirecting all the output to /dev/null to eliminate any outputs\n* checking if the script is already running in **/proc** if no it will relaunch\n* checks if the path **/tmp/.ICE-unix** exist otherwise it recreates it, apparently this is a known folder that exist in most of the linux servers, and why in **/tmp/** i think because the system deletes it contents after a period of time\n* reorder the **PATH** variable where he adds multiple paths like **/usr/bin /usr/local/bin  /tmp** and the current path and also the **/tmp/.ICE-unix** *(so that he can execute the script wherever the path is, i guess not sure really)*\n* loop through those list of paths that he added in the **PATH** variable and create a file called **i** and gives it execution permission. *(didn't know why he did it, but maybe because he is making sure that those path are executable or something not sure)*\n* checks if the curl exist and working otherwise he makes an alternative *(he will need such tool to download the malware, and for the alternative, he is making a raw tcp connection using* ***/dev/tcp/host/port*** *to download the curl from his server)*\n* finally the fun part *(downloading the malware)* he tries 4 different method to download the malware *(for the sake of to make the post shorter i will talk only about one method)*\n* he bypasses the server dns, tls checks, sender fingerprint, ANND he connected to a tor server via sock5 proxy all in 1 command ... *(scary and fascinating)*\n* finally he execute the script and removes it !\n\nmy curiosity pushed me a bit further and i have updated the script a bit so i can download the malware without executing it and see what is it about.\n\nI extracted the url and i downloaded malware hoping its a shell script too or something similar, i made sure that i removed the execution permission from it\\*(i was so scared to mess something up because again i know nothing about this, i only know how to program ... stuff ).\\*\n\nthe moment of truth has come, i tried to read to see its content. anddd .... fuck ! binary code .., the bastard compiled the code, i mean yea expectable, and that when i thought about emm why didn't he also complies the script that download the malware too, why only the malware !,\n\nI tried to use some online decompliers but no chance i only get some gibberish contents, all this happens yesterday and im writing this, the day after the incident.  \nanyway, this is my story and here is the script and please this is only for education purposes and to seek for any information from you guys, i have so many questions actually, please correct anything i said ....  \nTHE SCRIPT !:\n\n    i can't put the scipt here (cuz of Reddit's filters but yeah dm for the script)",

Other DBMSes have this too, e.g., SQL Server with `xp_cmdshell`. It's personally one of my favorite methods to execute OS commands.

It doesn’t get it perfect and sometimes it requires some manual work to get it from binary back into readable code, but it does its best \n\nYou can do this without running the program, so there is no risk to you \n\nHowever, malware is usually designed to be hard to reverse engineer in various ways, so it might take some time before you really understand it, especially if you’re just looking at it statically and not running it like you said\n\nSome other things that might be helpful if you’re curious about reverse engineering:\n\nIf you have access to a Linux command line and you type ‘strings -tx <your binary file>’ it will print all of the readable ascii strings in the binary. For example, log messages or links or function names might show up. The ‘-tx’ flag will give you the offset of that string in the file and you can press ctrl+g inside of ghidra and type in that address and it will take you there so you can inspect how it’s being used \n\nAlso ‘binwalk <your binary file>’ will look for recognizable structures in the binary that might be interesting for reverse engineering\n\nAll of this can be done without running the binary so it’s very little risk, just make sure to not run it on accident",

      "text": "Hi everyone! I’ve been experimenting with session handling and cookie‑based authentication **from a defensive/security testing standpoint**. In the past, copying and importing cookie data (for example via browser tools or extensions) between accounts sometimes allowed a session to be reused. This behavior worked for a while, but no longer does.\n\nPreviously, I built a small tool to **analyze session identifiers present in cookies** for research purposes, mainly to understand how session invalidation, binding, and rotation were implemented. I’d typically export cookies in JSON format and observe how modern platforms handled them when environments or accounts changed.\n\nNow that this approach no longer works, I’m trying to understand **what changes were introduced on the security side**—for example, whether it’s due to stricter session binding, device fingerprinting, token rotation, SameSite/HttpOnly flags, or server‑side validation improvements.\n\nDoes anyone have insight into which defensive mechanisms are now preventing session reuse, or what best practices platforms currently use to mitigate this class of issue? And also, if you know this thing can be bypassed, let me know.",

Now the cookie is just a reference to serverzside state that includes device, browser, TLS, and risk data.\n\nSessions are bound to the environment. Same cookie from another browser, machine, or network gets flagged or invalidated.\n\nTokens rotate fast and are killed on context change or parallel use.\n\nHttpOnly and SameSite are not the reason. Those only stop JS and CSRF, not replay.\n\nAss line: copying cookies fails because you’re missing most of the session context. When replay still works somewhere, it’s a broken implementation, not a bypass.",
