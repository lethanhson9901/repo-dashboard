I know the rules say no personal vendettas but I am not trying to snoop or get revenge, I just want his memories. Because this wasn’t expected, he left his phone behind and nobody knows his password. I just want into his phone because he had a lot of selfies and pictures I’d really like access to. The phone is an android celero5g. And I know most photos are backed up on Google photos but my dad was old so he used Yahoo. Whatever Gmail is tied to the phone we don’t know what it is me ",

Say you have a 500mbps downlink and I had a 1gbps uplink. I could (assuming your ISP doesn't rate limit traffic to your link) overwhelm your bandwidth by flooding it with UDP/ICMP/TCP. Despite your firewall dropping this, the traffic is still being pushed down your link before firewall sees it . This will saturate your downlink, slowing it to a crawl or completely overwhelming it.\n\nThen you have a Layer 7 DoS. This attempts to overwhelm the server itself, but sending legitimate requests in high volumes to saturate CPU and RAM, causing processes onboard to slow down or even crash.\n\nIn short, for L3, you need to generate more traffic than the endpoint can handle. Layer 7 you overload the server itself with requests to exhaust it.",

These can easily  exceed 10gbps, so it could easily max out a 10gbps router or switch. \nDefense: use a cdn or something like Amazon waf to block the request. There are packet scrubbers but it’s best to just use cdn/waf.\n\nSyn flood. Layer 3 resource exhaustion. They start a tcp handshake, but never finish it. If the server has 65000 open connections, it can’t accept any more. This was particularly useful 10+ years ago, when Apache would keep a handshake open for something like 10 minutes.\nDefense: also cdn or waf. Also the Apache/nginx tcp connection timeout default is pretty good nowadays. Normal users complete handshake within a second or 2. \n\nLayer 7. This is harder. They can request parts of the website which combines a kit of resources, so that your server is stuck processing. Could be thousands of requests for a static image (consuming disk performance) or something like a php script to break cpu/ram.\nDefense: layer 7 waf. Also use cdn to cache static images. Ensure they don’t bypass your cache for static assets. Ensure autoscaling is enabled for your services.",

Maybe you just don’t know where to look for it so you found a tool that helps you expose it. \n\nThere are protocols that can be abused. UDP has an issue where it doesn’t verify what the source actually is, so you can send requests from “fake” ip’s that the victim will respond to. If you send the right request, your small request can elicit a very large response, chewing up processing power and network usage. \n\nAlternatively most ddos attacks use compromised machines to send the requests. Botnets. You tell your botnet to start sending data to a victim. If you have 1000 lightbulbs under your control all over a country you can have them send a constant stream of packets. This won’t have a noticeable effect for the sources, their home router can handle one lightbulb sending data. The victim cannot handle 1000 devices all sending data at the same time. \n\nIf you got a group of toddlers and convinced them all to ask their teacher a question at the same time over and over, the teacher can probably handle a few and still pick out individual voices to answer and manage. If you got every kindergartner in the state to ask a question at the same time the teacher would have no idea and be overwhelmed.",

          "text": "It really depends. There are hundreds of different scenarios involving cloning and even more different ways to hack into devices. The exact circumstances you're in will define which you should go for and why. \n\nGenerally, hacking into a device is more fragile. The exploit might not work well, it might get detected and blocked, it might not survive long enough until disruption (update, restart, etc.), or it might be very difficult or impossible with your knowledge at the time.\n\n  \nCloning, on the other hand, is typically a simpler and more stable process. You can clone a device, then explore it offline anywhere. Sometimes you can clone it in a way that lets you still see some future activity and often even interact with it. It is, however, more limited. First, it typically requires more access to what you're cloning, either in terms of information or physically. Second, you can only explore the information you cloned, plus whatever accesses are still available and possible to use from the existing sessions. This means you could for example still see someone's email or messages, but you cannot see other future activity like him logging into his bank account after you clone it.   \n  \nBottom line is, in very general terms, cloning a device is easier but requires more access and is more limited in what it gives you access to. Hacking into a device is more fragile, more things can go wrong, and it's noisier, but it allows you to have better control and more power to do a lot more. One isn't better than the other, they're simply two ways to obtain overlapping but different kinds of information and access. They're both useful, depending on the situation. ",

If we're talking only about cloning, then what we would do is set up an app with a similar domain or name, and replicate how that portal looks completely. This wouldn't affect the real portal, we would just have a clone of that real portal, but it's effectively a different portal, one only we control. \n\nWe would have to get whoever we wanted to \"attack\" or trick, to use OUR portal instead of the real one. Since we control our portal we can show whatever we want. We can't, however, make any changes to the real portal. \n\nIf we want to make changes to the real portal we need to hack into it, not just clone it. \n\nCloning usually only allows us to make changes or have access to information on the real apps/devices in very specific scenarios. For example, cloning a phone completely or a computer, which contains all the logged-in sessions. In this case we could still use those sessions, if they were valid, hence being able to see or change the real accounts/systems. \n\nIn the scenario you presented, the only cloning we could do would be to replicate the portal as our own portal, without being able to touch the real one. If you wanted to affect the real one you'd have to hack into a device that has administrative access to the portal, or hack into the servers hosting the portal, or hack into the databases/backend connected to that portal.\n\nBottom line, yea your full scenario is possible, but not through cloning alone. \n\nHope it helped :D  \n",

I have a friend who’s a security engineer at Apple who thinks it makes the most sense to transition into whatever you have the most background in, which for me would obviously be either network or cloud. \n\nHaving read through this reddit as well as other Pentesting adjacent places, almost everyone says to go for web apps first. I am not sure whether I want to do full on pentesting in the future, my main goal is to transition into security. I absolutely love the act of pen testing, I think the one thing that makes me hesitant to want to do it is how hard it is to initially get into. My plan at this moment is to transition into some type of security role, and then determine whether I want to go for pentesting or another more senior security role after. \n\nBut my main purpose of this post was to get people’s opinions on whether I should focus on web apps first or net pentesting to start out with. I’ve read that its best to specialize in one area first and try to stand out from the rest of the crowd for the best chance at transitioning into the security field.

      "text": "Hopefully you're able to help. The site was discovered while searching for solutions to end a mass sound hacking attack. \n\nI'm a disabled 48 year old man with severe sensory PTSD, agoraphobia and psychogenic hyperventilation. \n\n Home is Broughton Astley, Leicester.\n\nSince 25 February 2023 hackers have remotely been adjusting TV sound frequency/pitch. It could be a radio frequency device?\n\nI've researched the devices extensively but the technical terminology is unfamiliar and it isn't clear which device would work. The person is known to me and formed a vendetta in a gym between 2017/18. I heard them discussing their use of related technology in the gym among friends but didn't gleen more specific details.\n\nI haven't seen them since January 2018 and reported this many times but still it continues. I've liaised with several doctors and it's not imagined or exaggerated. Various sound files prove how poor the TV sound frequency is.\n\nThey heard the files as have many others and after doing so were in no doubt. The hacker also does it to the mobile, tablet and laptop but I've only captured it on the TV. It sounds even worse in person. Several hearing tests revealed my hearing is fine. Is there any secure router or network solution you can suggested that would block them? I purchased a TP Link Archer Vx1800v last year but it's suggested security features didn't stop any of the attacks.\n\n17 TVs and several soundbars were replaced under warranty in 2023 as the hacking continues. An alternative non smart TV was also purchased but once it connected by aerial they hacked the sound on that too. \n\n They alter the frequency/pitch so vocals are tinny, hollow and distorted. It induces severe nausea, tightening chest and thorax, inability to draw deep breath, laboured breath and tremor as the sound is terrible. \n\n Please note that they live in Watford, 70 miles away from me. It's an unprovoked anti-disability vendetta. \n\n It most definitely is happening, is possible and isn't imagined.\n\n Please advise on devices/tools that I can purchase which would re-adjust the TV frequency/pitch to the level it should be at or how it could be blocked.\n\n \n\nMany thanks and yours sincerely, ",

          "text": "Assuming this is OTA television, UK TV frequencies range from 470-854MHz. There’s no possible way someone is doing anything to the signal from 70 miles away—at least not without a very tall tower, and a lot more people than you would be affected. \n\nAssuming this is streaming television, it’s still very unlikely that anyone is continually hacking your systems. Streaming services are going to have some sort of encryption mechanism so traffic can’t be intercepted between the source and destination—even when using UDP. The only type of people that would even have this type of ability (to continually hacking devices) are going to be state level actors. They will not waste multiple millions of dollars and years of research on someone that isn’t a government official, diplomat, journalist, or activist. The chances of being continually hacked when changing to different hardware vendors makes it even less likely. \n\nThen saying they are doing it over both over the air and through internet, just lowers the likelihood. OTA would be easier to confirm, you’d just need a SDR and a directional antenna. From there you can isolate signal directions and compare those bearings from your location to known transmitting towers. Again, you’d be wasting a lot of time because for someone to be messing with you from 70 miles away, while you’re using OTA, UHF band television is going to be nearly impossible to focus radio waves small enough to only impact a single person. \n\nAll of that to say the chances you are constantly being hacked is so low that it’s statistically improbable. What’s more likely, and even then the chances are almost zero, is something closer to you could be causing interference at just the right frequencies to distort signal. What makes that almost statistically zero is you’re “hacked” using both OTA and streaming.",

I'll just be straight up here, no one is doing what you are saying and there is some other factor involved and the most logical answer is a medical one.\n\nTechnology is not something you just 'hack'. Every device is different, you are using different apps on your smart TV and they all have different methods and secure servers to pull their content from. For someone to intercept those streams, decode the audio and then reencode the audio and replace it on your TV would be an excessive and rather complicated thing to pull off and would require physical access to each device and the capability to install custom hacked certificates on to let the intercepts happen.\n\nWith everything going over SSL and being encrypted this just isn't a thing that you are mentioning. Live TV on old analog signals could have easily been tampered with but not only you would be experiencing it, lots of others would and they would be making noise over it.\n\nYou already touched on health issues, there is more to this than technology problems I can assure you that.

She formed a vendetta and its totally unprovoked. Plus there were hints the TV, phone and laptop hacking would begin on instagram in February 2023. It isnt imagined or exaggerated and I'm not sitting her hearing distorted sound pitch. Please, please dont gaslight. Sound files have been played to friends. Family, doctors and all have confirmed its very uncomfortable for them to listen to and is very likely hacking. Please only respond if you can help with technical solutions and if you know of ways it can be done and most importantly ended. This particular hacker is sitting at home and alters all devices I use as part of her daily routine so the phone, laptop sound is also often very uncomfortable. I've had hearing tests and my hearing is fine. I understand its far fetched for people who haven't experienced it but I have no reason to lie. To those who have suggested measuring signals etc, please elaborate in simple terms. \nAgain, please dont respond with unconstructive posts about how its not possible. Also, its been reported many times but nothing could be done due to the complexity and evidence gathering. \n\n\nMany thanks,\n\n\nJosh ",
