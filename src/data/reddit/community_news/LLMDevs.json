Next use leidens algo to divide it into clusters and label those clusters ( for example AuthHandler cluster ) next find out the entrypoint of each service and DFS into the CALL chain to get the process maps in each cluster.\n\nSo the graph is quite accurate for static analyses, for the stuff like dynamic imports, runtime stuff, the cluster and process map handles most of it. These also saves a lot of tokens since the tools itself r intelligent not depending too much on LLM figuring stiff out.",

You build a cool agentic workflow, and it works great for the first few turns. By turn 60, it starts doing those statistical parlor tricks where it just ignores half your instructions or forgets a preference you established three sessions ago.\n\nThe problem is that stateless retrieval is, well, stateless. It’s fine for pulling static docs, but it doesn't actually 'learn' who the user is. You can try recursive summarization or sliding windows, but honestly, you’re just burning tokens to delay inevitable instruction drift.\n\nI spent the last few months building a layer to handle long-term state properly. I’m calling it MemOS (probably an overloaded term, but it manages the lifecycle). It’s an MIT-licensed layer that sits between the agent and the LLM.\n\nWhy stateless retrieval isn't enough:\n\nThe first thing people ask is why not just use a Vector DB. They are great for storage, but they don't have a logic layer for state. If a user says 'I hate Python' in turn 5 and 'actually I’m starting to like Python' in turn 50, a standard search returns both. It’s a mess.\n\nMemOS handles the lifecycle—it merges similar memories, moves old stuff to a 'MemVault' (cold storage), and resolves conflicts based on a freshness protocol.\n\nFacts vs. Preferences:\n\nI realized agents fail because they treat all context the same. I split them up:\n\n\\- Facts: Hard data (e.g., 'The project deadline is Friday')\n\n\\- Preferences: How the user wants things done (e.g., 'No unwraps in Rust, use safe error handling')\n\nWhen you hit addMessage, it extracts these into 'MemCubes' automatically so you don't have to manually tag everything.\n\nThe Implementation:\n\nI tried to keep the DX pretty simple, basically just a wrapper around your existing calls.\n\nfrom memos import MemClient\n\nclient = MemClient(api\\_key=\"your\\_key\") # or localhost\n\n\\# This extracts facts/prefs automatically in the background\n\nclient.add\\_message(\n\nuser\\_id=\"dev\\_123\",\n\nrole=\"user\",\n\ncontent=\"I'm on a Rust backend. Avoid unwraps, I want safe error handling.\"\n\n)\n\n\\# Retrieval prioritizes preferences and freshness\n\ncontext = client.search\\_memory(user\\_id=\"dev\\_123\", query=\"How to handle this Result?\")\n\nprint(context)\n\n\\# Output: \\[Preference: Avoids unwraps\\] \\[Fact: Working on Rust backend\\]\n\nLatency & 'Next-Scene Prediction':\n\nInjecting a massive history into every prompt is a great way to go broke and spike your latency. I added an async scheduling layer called Next-Scene Prediction. It basically predicts what memories the agent will need next based on the current convo trajectory and pre-loads them into the KV Cache.\n\nTech Stack:\n\nCore: Python / TypeScript\n\nInference: KV Cache acceleration + Async scheduling\n\nIntegrations: Claude MCP, Dify, Coze\n\nLicense: MIT (Self-hostable)\n\nSafety & Benchmarks:\n\nI’m using a 'Memory Safety Protocol' to check for source verification and attribution. Testing it against the LoCoMo dataset shows way better recall for preferences than standard top-k retrieval.\n\nIt’s still early and definitely has some rough edges. If you want to poke around, the GitHub is open and there’s a playground to test the extraction logic.\n\nRepo / Docs:\n\n\\- Github:  https://github.com/MemTensor/MemOS\n\n\\- Docs:  https://memos-docs.openmem.net/cn",

Not a reasoning failure—a data coverage problem. Adding \\~500 targeted examples would likely fix most of these.\n\n**Takeaway:** For narrow, exact tasks with controllable domains, small models trained from scratch can be practical, inspectable, and cheap to iterate on.

      "text": "I am a college student. Last summer I worked in SWE in the financial space and helped build a user facing AI chatbot that lived directly on the company website.\n\nBefore shipping, I mostly thought prompt injection was an academic or edge case concern. Then real users showed up.\n\nWithin days, people were actively trying to jailbreak the system. Mostly curiosity driven it seemed, but still bypassing system instructions, surfacing internal context, and pushing the model into behavior it was never supposed to exhibit.\n\nWe tried the usual fixes. Stronger system prompts, more guardrails, traditional MCP style controls, etc. They helped, but none of them actually solved the problem. The failures only showed up once the system was live and stateful, under real usage patterns you cannot *realistically* simulate in testing.\n\nWhat stuck with me is how easy this is to miss right now. A lot of developers are shipping LLM powered features quickly, treating prompt injection as a theoretical concern rather than a production risk. That was exactly my mindset before this experience. If you are not using AI when building (for most use cases) today, you are behind, but many of us are unknowingly deploying systems with real permissions and no runtime security model behind them.\n\nThis experience really got me in the deep end of all this stuff and is what pushed me to start building towards a solution to hopefully enhance my skills and knowledge along the way. I have made decent progress so far and just finished a website for it which I can share if anyone wants to see but I know people hate promo so I won't force it lol. My core belief is that prompt security cannot be solved purely at the prompt layer. You need runtime visibility into behavior, intent, and outputs.\n\nI am posting here mostly to get honest feedback.\n\nFor those building production LLM systems:\n\n* does runtime prompt abuse show up only after launch for you too\n* do you rely entirely on prompt design and tool gating, or something else\n* where do you see the biggest failure modes today\n\nHappy to share more details if useful. Genuinely curious how others here are approaching this issue and if it is a real problem for anyone else.",

Those are not ifs, those are facts. When you create any public facing service, what it does is really a secondary concern. Your main issue is to think of any possible threat and mitigate it. For instance, I would never create anything that is public facing and doesn't require an account. Then you can detect harmful behaviour just by adding observing agent that looks at the chat interaction without being engaged in it and is able to lock user out when it detects any foul play. There are many other ways to implement basic chat security.",

The part that surprised me was how much harder this becomes with LLMs compared to traditional services.

Observing agents and heuristics help too, sure, but they still rely on assumptions about intent that break down once prompts get stateful and context bleeds across turns.

I have a couple free tools I've been using for this.\n* **Runtime visibility**: log tool calls + retrievals, rate limit probing patterns, and add a few (as many as you can) jailbreak tests that run continuously on real flows.\n\nPrompts still matter, but more as polish.

By routing traffic through a controlled backend, we gain the runtime visibility needed to monitor behavior and enforce data residency in real-time. SSO protects the entrance, but the proxy protects the data flow. Relying on system prompts to prevent exfiltration is a production risk we hope to thwart by centralizing control at the proxy layer.\n\nNow if your endpoint is connected to internal tools (like a database or file search), that opens a whole new can of worms.",

Agents—especially the Gemini CLI—tend to mess things up and leave no trace of what they actually changed.\n\nThe ones that insist on 'planning' first, like Kiro or Antigravity, eventually over-code so much that I spend another hour just reverting their mistakes. I only want agents for specific, local scripts—like a Python tool for ActivityWatch that updates my calendar every hour or pings me if I’m wasting time on YouTube.\n\nI want to know is there something i am missing? like better way to code with agents?",

Just in the last few months these LLMs have finally gotten good enough so I can bang out say a 300 line Rust struct, then just pass it to Gemini to fix all the syntax and braces / brackets errors, and have it actually work.  That's been really nice, and a huge time saver.\n\n\n\nOther than that, I don't ever use code from LLMs as I find it slopppy, overly verbose, and poor design choices.  That's expected, as these are just predictive machines trained on the entirety of the internet, so by design, you're going to get the most average, middle of the road code out there.\n\n\n\nI do however use Claude Code asisstant here and there.  If I just need something done for a data processing or training pipeline of some kind, and other things that won't be going into production, then I'll sometimes use that.   Although think I'll start steering away from that, because as per usual, when I begin leaning on these things more I end up realizing their screw ups ultimately cost me more time and stress than any initial development time savings I get.",

          "text": "I find that I keep moving back and forth between web chat copy/paste and Qwen Code / Copilot Agent Mode etc. What's often missing in the discussions here is what languages and tech stack you are using and the state of the code base. Let me provide an example, I tried to use agents to build a Flutter app from scratch and it was a horrible waste of time. After a week of evenings I gave up and used Gemini Pro on the web instead, that worked great and was many times faster.\n\nWhen you know how to write the code, but see that the AI generates about 80-90% correct code, it's at least for me,, faster to just do copy paste, fix the last 10-20%, than it is to watch the AI correct it self like a trainwreck, retry, test, compile, try to fix something completely unrelated, still fail and announce that it successfully completed the task, remind it and have it try again, until it succeeded but at the same time refactored a bunch of unrelated stuff and left piles of unused code from trial and errors.\n\nFunny thing, once my Flutter app was practically feature complete, I tried Qwen Code again, and this time it actually worked perfectly, my guess is that there were enough code there for it to understand what needed to be done and how to fit it in, as opposed to an empty or nearly empty code base.\n\nFor other projects, I've had better success, HTML/JavaScript/CSS seems to work rather well, and creating boilerplate code in C# also works well, when the right classes are in the context for the AI to know how things should be implemented.\n\nMy point is that how successful you are seems to depend on multiple factors, such as how well the model handles your specific tech stack, and even down to specific versions of libraries, in addition to how clean, large or small your codebase is. And I also suspect that people have different tolerances for watching the AI trainwreck trying to repair it's mistakes, versus doing it them self, and what quality of code they accept. \n\nAt the end of the day, most important, is that every developer needs to own the code that the AI generates, when main branch breaks, or bugs reach customers, it's not AI's fault, it's the developer who needs to own it and fix it.",

      "text": "Some of you might have seen my [previous post](https://reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1obp91s/i_opensourced_stanfords_agentic_context/) about my open-source implementation of ACE (Agentic Context Engineering). ACE is a framework that makes agents learn from their own execution feedback without fine-tuning.\n\nI've now built a specific application: agentic system prompting from agent traces.\n\nI kept noticing my agents making the same mistakes across runs. I fixed it by digging through traces, figure out what went wrong, patch the system prompt, repeat. It works, but it's tedious and didn't really scale.\n\nSo I built a way to automate this. You feed ACE your agent's historical execution traces, and it extracts actionable prompt improvements automatically.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **ReplayAgent** \\- Simulates agent behavior from recorded conversations (no live runs)\n2. **Reflector** \\- Analyzes what succeeded/failed, identifies patterns\n3. **SkillManager** \\- Transforms reflections into atomic, actionable strategies\n4. **Deduplicator** \\- Consolidates similar insights using embeddings\n5. **Skillbook** \\- Outputs human-readable recommendations with evidence\n\n**Each insight includes:**\n\n* Prompt suggestion - the actual text to add to your system prompt\n* Justification - why this change would help based on the analysis\n* Evidence - what actually happened in the trace that led to this insight\n\n**How this compares to DSPy/GEPA:**\n\nWhile DSPy works best with structured data (input/output pairs), ACE is designed to work directly on execution traces (logs, conversations, markdown files) and keeps humans in the loop for review. Compared to GEPA, the ACE paper was able to show significant improvements on benchmarks.\n\n**Try it yourself:** [https://github.com/kayba-ai/agentic-context-engine/tree/main/examples/agentic-system-prompting](https://github.com/kayba-ai/agentic-context-engine/tree/main/examples/agentic-system-prompting)\n\nWould love to hear your feedback if you do try it out",

Same thing at offices, hospitals, cruise ships. The agents are there, but there's no way to discover them.\n\nA2A (Google's agent-to-agent protocol) handles how agents talk to each other. MCP handles how agents use tools. But neither answers a basic question: how do you find agents in the first place?\n\nSo I built LAD-A2A, a simple discovery protocol. When you connect to a Wi-Fi, your agent can automatically find what's available using mDNS (like how AirDrop finds nearby devices) or a standard HTTP endpoint.\n\nThe spec is intentionally minimal. I didn't want to reinvent A2A or create another complex standard. LAD-A2A just handles discovery, then hands off to A2A for actual communication.\n\nOpen source, Apache 2.0. Includes a working Python implementation you can run to see it in action. Repo can be found at franzvill/lad.\n\nCurious what people think!",

The agent can be naive about what's underneath.\n\nWith writes, you can't hide the schema. The agent isn't consuming structure—it's producing it. Every field, every constraint, every relationship needs to be explicit.\n\nUnless you model writes as files.\n\nFiles are a universal interface. The agent already knows JSON, YAML, markdown. The schema isn't embedded in your tool definitions—it's the file format itself.\n\nFour primitives. Not forty.\n\nWrote up the full breakdown with Vercel's d0 results: \n\nhttps://michaellivs.com/blog/architecture-behind-claude-code\n\nCurious if others have hit this same wall with write tools.",

Basically the agent reasons, runs commands, analyzes responses, and adapts its approach as it goes.\n\nThe issue: It's stateless. Every API call needs the full conversation history so the model knows what's going on. After 20-30 turns, I'm easily hitting 50-100k tokens per request, and costs go through the roof  \n  \nWhat I've tried:\n\n  \\- Different models/providers (GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5mini, GPT 5.2,  DeepSeek, DeepInfra with open-source models...)\n\n  \\- OpenAI's prompt caching (helps but cache expires)\n\n  \\- Context compression (summarizing old turns, truncating outputs, keeping only the last N messages)\n\n  \\- Periodic conversation summaries  \n\n\nThe problem is every approach has tradeoffs. Compress too much and the agent \"forgets\" what it already tried and goes in circles. Don't compress enough and it costs a fortune.  \n\n\nMy question:\n\nFor those working on autonomous agents or multi-turn LLM apps:\n\n  \\- How do you handle context growth on long sessions?\n\n  \\- Any clever tricks beyond basic compression?\n\n  \\- Have you found a good balance between keeping context and limiting costs?\n\n\n\nCurious to hear your experience if you've dealt with this kind of problem.",

Once agents become long running and toolusing, the real cost isn’t actually tokens, it’s repeatedly reconstructing state. Compression can help but it’s lossy by definition. which is why agents loop or forget. One alternative pattern that work better is treating agent state as runtime state instead of prompt state . keep the model warm, preserve KV / execution context across turns, and only serialize when you truly need to suspend. That shifts the problem from prompt engineering to lifecycle management, but it avoids paying the full context price on every step.",

OpenAI's prompt caching now supports 24h retention which helps, but it still requires exact prefix matches and the cache can get invalidated easily when the conversation branches.\n\nI've been looking into self-hosted options. Looks like vLLM + LMCache is the go-to combo for this apparently it can give 3-10x improvements on multi-turn workloads by properly managing KV cache across turns. There's also llm-d for KV-cache aware routing if you're running multiple instances.  \n  \nHave you actually deployed something like this in production? My main concern is whether open-source models (Llama, Qwen, etc.) can match GPT-4o /GTP 5 quality for agentic tasks that require good reasoning and tool use. Trading 10x cost savings for an agent that hallucinates more doesn't seem worth it.\n\nTbh I'm not an expert, still figuring all this out as I go.

KV cache reuse (vLLM, LMCache, cache aware routing) absolutely helps, but it still assumes a mostly warm, long lived process. For agentic workloads with branching, tool waits, and spiky traffic, the bigger win for us was treating each step as a short lived execution and externalizing state entirely. That way you’re not paying tokens or GPUs to “remember” things that the system already knows. On model quality, we’ve seen that open source models can match GPT 4 class reasoning for many agent loops when tool use is explicit and scoped, but for the hardest reasoning steps we still mix in frontier models. In practice it ends up being a hybrid system, not an either or tradeoff between cost and correctness.",

I ended up using a hybrid approach - I keep the full last 3-4 turns in detail, then maintaining a *really* condensed running log off just actions taken and key outcomes (like \"tested login endpoint - got 403\"). \n\nthe real hack for me was caching selectors and page structures separately so the agent doesn't need the full HTML every time. I actually started using Actionbook for this recently - it kinda automates that manual caching/action manual creation I was doing, which cut my tokens usage on browser tasks by a stupid amount. not sure if it fits security testing directly, but for reducing repetitive context it helped me break the cycle of agents re-analyzing the same UI elements.\n\nstill have to tune the compression aggressively though, and sometimes the agent doesn't get lost. it's a constant trade-off.",

Optimize an existing article from a URL or pasted content  \n2. Generate a full SEO content brief before writing, just from a topic\n\nEverything runs through a Streamlit UI with real-time progress and clean, document-style outputs. Here’s the stack I used to build it:\n\n\\- Agno for multi-agent orchestration  \n\\- Nebius for LLM inference  \n\\- SerpAPI for Google AI Mode and AI Overview data  \n\\- Streamlit for the UI\n\nAll reports are saved locally so teams can reuse them.\n\nThe project is intentionally focused and not a full SEO suite, but it’s been useful for content refreshes and planning articles that actually align with how Google AI surfaces results now.\n\nI’ve shared a full walkthrough here: [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZwgey_YeF0)  \nAnd the code is here if you want to explore or extend it: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Arindam200/awesome-ai-apps/tree/main/advance_ai_agents/content_team_agent)\n\nWould love feedback on missing features or ideas to push this further.",

Decisions only occur at explicit, closed boundaries\n\nThe system never acts on streaming or unfinished data.\n\nAll decisions are gated on **closed time windows**.  \nThis eliminated several classes of failure:\n\n* phantom actions caused by transient states\n* rapid oscillation near thresholds\n* overlapping execution paths\n\nIf the boundary is not closed, the system refuses to act.\n\n# 2. “Do nothing” is the safest default\n\nThe system is intentionally biased toward inaction.\n\n* API error → HOLD\n* LLM timeout → HOLD\n* Partial or inconsistent data → HOLD\n* Conflicting signals → HOLD\n\nIn ambiguous situations, *not acting* is considered the safest outcome.\n\n# 3. Strict separation of concerns\n\nThe system is split into independent layers:\n\n* data preparation\n* LLM-based decision\n* execution\n* logging and notification\n* post-action accounting\n\nEach layer can fail independently without cascading into repeated actions  \nor runaway behavior.\n\nFor example, notifications react only to **confirmed state changes**,  \nnot to intended or predicted actions.\n\n# 4. Features that were intentionally removed\n\nSeveral ideas were tested and then removed after increasing operational risk:\n\n* adaptive or performance-based scaling\n* averaging down / martingale behavior\n* intra-window predictions\n* confidence-weighted LLM actions\n* automatic restart into uncertain internal states\n\nThe system became *more stable* by explicitly **not doing these things**.\n\n# Why I’m sharing this\n\nI’m sharing this to **organize and reflect on lessons learned** from operating  \na non-deterministic LLM component in a live system.\n\nThe feedback here is for personal learning and refinement of system design.  \nAny future write-up would be technical and experience-based,  \nnot monetized and not promotional.\n\n# Looking for discussion\n\nI’d appreciate perspectives from people who have:\n\n* deployed LLMs or ML components in always-on systems\n* dealt with non-determinism and failure modes in production\n* strong opinions on fail-safe vs fail-open design\n\nIf this kind of operational discussion is useful (or not), I’d like to know.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/79npeu8hxvgg1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0be3702d0694e3f1ff0f73c9d8b8e4b8fbf3b548\n\n\n\n*Not selling anything here.

Its output isn’t treated as an explanation or a recommendation — it’s a state classification signal. We deliberately stripped away expressive language and made responses repetitive, terse, and sometimes even boring.\n\nOver time, that shifted trust away from the LLM as an “actor” and toward the system as a whole.
