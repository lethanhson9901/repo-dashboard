      "text": "**TL;DR:** I designed and built a full RAG system over 10,000 NASA technical documents spanning the 1950s to 2025 — we're talking scanned typewriter reports, handwritten notes, propulsion diagrams, mathematical formulas, failure investigations. Off-the-shelf tools broke down fast. I ended up building a custom pipeline using Qwen3-VL-8B to process what traditional OCR and parsers couldn't handle, ran the whole thing on a single H100 (657,000+ pages, \\~180 pages/min), and built an agentic retrieval system that doesn't just search — it investigates like a domain expert. The architecture is designed to scale to 100K+ documents. Everything was live-streamed (140+ hours across 15 streams), and the GitHub repo for the document processing pipeline and infra is coming soon.\n\nHey everyone, I'm Raj. Over the last 2 weeks, I live-streamed building what turned out to be the most technically challenging project I've taken on — and I wanted to share the experience while it's fresh. This is a long one, I tried to keep it short, but there was too much that I think is genuinely useful to cut.\n\n# The Domain\n\nSo here's the scenario I designed for this project — a fictional aerospace consultancy called \"Meridian Aerospace,\" modeled on very real challenges these companies face.\n\n85,000+ documents accumulated over 70+ years — real documents from NASA's Technical Reports Server (NTRS). Propulsion test reports, failure investigations, component specs, regulatory filings. Engineers spending 4-6 hours per project digging through archives. A missed critical failure mode last quarter because the relevant data was buried in a 1997 test report nobody knew existed.\n\nNow here's what makes these documents painful:\n\n* 1950s–1990s scanned reports — photocopied, faxed, re-scanned, degraded quality\n* Dense technical diagrams everywhere: thrust curves, propulsion schematics, thermal analysis charts\n* Mathematical formulas and engineering equations scattered throughout\n* Domain-specific acronyms (Isp, TWR, LOX, MMH, NTO) that are often never expanded in the text\n* Cross-references between documents — failure reports cite original test data, compliance docs reference design specs\n* Tables spanning multiple pages with nested sub-headers\n\nI used 10,000 documents from NASA's Technical Reports Server as the working dataset, with the architecture designed from day one to handle the full 85K+ and beyond.\n\n# What I Built\n\nI'll walk through the three main layers, but I want to be clear — these aren't independent pieces you build one after another. They feed into each other constantly. Decisions in the document processing layer directly shaped how the agent works, and understanding how engineers actually think (the agent layer) changed how I approached extraction. It's all connected.\n\n# The Document Processing Pipeline\n\nThis is where a huge chunk of the work lived, and honestly where most people underestimate the difficulty. The core realization: **you cannot build good retrieval over bad extractions.** If your chunked text is garbage, no embedding model or re-ranker is going to save you.\n\nI used Docling (from IBM, I know it has a ton of issues — I found workarounds and solved them too) for layout detection — figuring out where tables, figures, formulas, and text blocks sit on each page. Then Qwen3-VL-8B to actually interpret what's in those regions.\n\nA few of the harder problems:\n\n**Formula association:** Docling detects formulas fine, but they lose their position in the document flow. So you get a formula floating at the end of a page with no connection to the paragraph it belongs to. I built a system that paints colored bounding boxes with ID numbers directly onto page screenshots, then asks the VLM \"where does Formula 7 belong relative to these numbered paragraphs?\" Sounds weird, works surprisingly well. Gives you reading-order accuracy without re-OCRing anything.\n\n**Complex tables:** These were probably the single most painful thing to solve. We're talking massive grids — 72 columns by 50 rows of stability data — where position determines meaning. Down arrows mean \"carry this value down.\" Brackets group five rows under \"Unstable.\" Zebra lines and grid lines guide the human eye across dense numbers. Standard OCR reads left-to-right, top-to-bottom and has no idea what to do with any of this. Parsers treat the grid lines as noise or lose alignment if the scan is slightly tilted.\n\nI went through a lot of approaches. Standard markdown extraction lost alignment. CV-based heatmaps and projection lines to detect rows — worked about 80% but too brittle for production. JSON output from the VLM broke constantly on large tables (missed closing brackets). Small models (7B) hallucinated numbers and missed columns entirely.\n\nWhat actually worked was treating the table as a photograph of data rather than a stream of text. Use Docling purely for finding the bounding box coordinates, crop the original high-res page image (no downscaling — that destroys data in dense tables), and send the full-resolution crop to a large VLM. You need 72B+ to hold context across a 30-column table without losing track.\n\nTwo tricks that made a real difference. First, for tables with zebra lines or warped scans, I pre-process the image by drawing red horizontal lines onto it before sending to the VLM — basically a \"digital ruler\" that forces the model to keep row alignment. Second, the prompt strategy — instead of asking for just structured output, I ask for markdown (way more robust than JSON for grid data) plus a \"notes\" field where the model captures visual shorthand. \"If there's a down arrow, note the value is carried down. If there's a bracket, note the grouping.\" The model successfully returned \"unstable\" for rows that didn't explicitly have the text but were visually grouped under an \"Unstable\" bracket.\n\nFor the truly dense tables that still needed more work, I have a fallback that generates a detailed description and serves the raw image alongside it — which honestly, in aerospace, engineers prefer anyway over a potentially wrong structured output. But this isn't a dead end. The digital ruler approach and the prompt strategy were working well, and with more time I think there's a solid solution there. I was time-boxed to 2 weeks for this entire project, so I made the pragmatic call to move on. Might revisit this specifically and share if I make a breakthrough.\n\n**Legacy scan quality:** Documents from the 1960s have noise, \"Confidential\" stamps, hole punches, scan artifacts — and models happily pick all of these up as \"figures.\" Added a classification step asking the VLM: \"Is this a technical diagram or just a document artifact?\" Simple, but it cleaned up a lot of noise.\n\n**The full-page strategy:** I initially tried cropping individual formulas to save tokens. Docling's format detection models missed about 60% of small formulas in dense pages. So I pivoted — if any formula is detected on a page, send the entire page screenshot to the VLM and let it transcribe everything in reading order. More expensive per page (didn't matter as I deployed on a GPU), but the accuracy difference is massive. In this domain, a missed variable isn't a minor bug.\n\n**On OCR,** I didn't actually need traditional OCR for most of the heavy lifting. The figures, tables, and formulas — which are the hardest parts of these documents — were all handled by the VLM pipeline. OCR was only needed as a fallback for pages where the embedded text layer was missing or corrupted. So the approach became: use native text extraction where available, VLM for all the visual/structured content, and OCR only when truly needed. Disabling forced OCR where it wasn't necessary cut processing time significantly.\n\n# H100 Infrastructure & Scaling\n\nProcessing 10K documents — roughly 657,000+ pages — on a single H100 was its own adventure.\n\n**Where it started:** My first attempt was basically a monolithic script. Every worker loaded the PDF, loaded the model onto the GPU, ran inference, unloaded. Workers were fighting each other for GPU memory, CPU, RAM. Everything was crashing. Back-of-the-napkin math said this approach would take somewhere around 28 days for the full dataset. Obviously not going to work.\n\n**The rewrite:** I moved to a proper service-oriented architecture. Separated the CPU-heavy work (Docling parsing, chunking, text extraction) from the GPU-heavy work (VLM inference). Stateless Celery workers handle the CPU side, feeding requests to a persistent vLLM server that does nothing but inference. Redis as the message broker. Took some inspiration from how production ML systems handle millions of requests with limited compute — keep your inference engine as a persistent service, don't have each worker spin it up and tear it down.\n\nThat alone brought the estimate down to maybe 5-9 days. Still not great.\n\n**Then the tuning started.** FP8 quantization because running standard GGUF/Ollama on an H100 is wasting the hardware — FP8 is specifically optimized for Hopper. Concurrency tuning: tested 6, 8, 9, 10 Docling workers. 9 caused instant OOM. 10 saturated the queue. 6 underutilized the GPU. 8 was the sweet spot. Dynamic image scaling for oversized PDFs — some scans were 170MB, crashing workers during bitmap conversion. VRAM memory leak management — usage would creep up batch after batch until it crashed, so I added explicit garbage collection between cycles.\n\n**End result:** \\~2.5 days, running at about 180 pages per minute. From 28 days to 2.5 days on the same hardware, just by thinking about architecture and resource management. Again, could have done better, but was on a time crunch.\n\n# The Agent & Retrieval Layer\n\nThis part tends to get underestimated. Building the agent wasn't just \"wire up some tools to an LLM and write a system prompt.\" A huge amount of time went into two things: understanding the people who would actually use this system, and shaping how the agent itself thinks.\n\nI spent a lot of time with Claude role-playing as different engineer personas — a cautious senior engineer (\"Sandra\") approaching retirement who's seen things go wrong, a junior engineer who searches too narrowly. I was trying to understand: how does their day actually work? How do they use current traditional systems? What's literally going through their mind when they're investigating a failure mode? What are they worried about that they won't say out loud?\n\nThat process shaped everything about the agent. For example — engineers don't just look for failure cases. They specifically look for *success cases* as counter-evidence to validate risky designs. A standard RAG setup completely misses that nuance. Or the fact that a \"question about a valve failure\" might actually be about defending a design decision in a review meeting next week. The agent needs to understand the situation behind the question.\n\nThat understanding fed directly into how I designed the agent's reasoning. One of the bigger realizations was that spiking domain intuition in the system prompt often outperforms complex retrieval engineering. Instead of hardcoding examples, I focused on making the agent think like a propulsion engineer. It should be low-opinionated and already have hypotheses before it runs a single search. When someone mentions a pressure value, it should have intuition about whether that's nominal or concerning. When it finds a document, it should reason about what it means, not just return it. It's not a search tool — it's a reasoning engine with engineering expertise that uses search as one of its tools. And honestly, this is still just at the system prompt level — keeping it low-opinionated, letting the model lean on its own domain knowledge rather than constraining it — but it brings absolute wonders to how the system behaves.\n\nWhat came out of all that work:\n\nThe agent doesn't just search — it investigates. It maintains a working task list and notes, forms hypotheses based on its domain intuition before it even touches the search tool, and updates its understanding as it learns. When a question branches, it spawns sub-agents for parallel research threads. It can navigate — read adjacent chunks, follow cross-references between documents, pull threads across decades of reports.\n\nWhen the text extraction is uncertain — and on 1950s docs, it will be — the agent can request a screenshot of the actual PDF page region to visually verify what it's reading. That \"visual region\" tool ended up being one of the most important things in the whole system. It's the bridge between \"95% OCR accuracy\" and \"actually trustworthy in aerospace.\"\n\nI also integrated the NASA Thesaurus — 18K aerospace terms filtered down to 3.5K propulsion-relevant concepts — so the system handles query expansion properly. \"LOX\" matches \"Liquid Oxygen,\" \"2000 PSI\" finds results mentioning \"13.9 MPa.\" Without this, you're relying on exact keyword matches in a domain where everyone uses different terminology for the same thing.\n\nAnd time-boxed search — engineers ask things like \"what do we know about cryogenic engine failures between 1970 and 1980?\" Filtering by time period before semantic search cuts the search space dramatically. When I tested this, the agent successfully traced the 50-year evolution of cryogenic systems — from passive insulation in the 1970s to active cryo-coolers in the 2020s — without any deep research mode. Just proper filtering and good retrieval.\n\n# What's Coming Next\n\nI've linked all the YouTube streams in the comments below — 15 streams, some of them are 11+ hours long, so obviously that's a lot to sit through. To make things more digestible and actually useful, I'm going to be posting specific problem/solution breakdowns over the next few days, including how I evaluated the system with 10K docs. Each of these topics was genuinely its own nightmare to solve, and I think the details will be helpful for anyone working on similar problems.\n\nI'm also hoping to open-source the document processing pipeline and infrastructure code on GitHub soon, which I think will be genuinely useful for anyone dealing with large-scale document processing — whether it's aerospace or not.\n\nOne last thing — I genuinely want to thank the team behind Claude Code. Being honest, a project like this would realistically take a team of 3-4 engineers working 3-4 months. The document processing pipeline alone, the infrastructure, the agent design, the frontend, evaluation — each of these is a serious body of work. I did it solo in 2 weeks, live on stream, and that would not have been possible without Claude Code, it was in the loop for pretty much all of it. Seriously, thank you to the engineers behind it.\n\nHappy to answer questions, and if you've dealt with similar problems — legacy docs, domain-specific retrieval, scaling document processing — I'd love to hear what you ran into.",

You end up with either poor results from semantic search or complex data pipelines.\n\nAlso - searching for knowledge is only part of the problem for agents. I’ve seen some articles and posts on X, Medium, Reddit, etc about agent memory and in a lot of ways it seems like that’s the natural evolution of RAG. You treat knowledge as a form of semantic memory and one piece of a bigger set of memory requirements. \n\nThere was a paper published from Google late last year about self-evolving agents and another one talking about adaptive agents.\n\nIf you had a good solution to memory, it seems like you could get to the point where these ideas come together and you could use a combination of knowledge, episodic memory, user feedback, etc to make agents actually learn.\n\nSeems like that could be the future for solving agent data. Anyone tried to do this? ",

I think we haven't reached the necessary maturity in best practice guidance in regards to when which kind and strategy of grounding information injection into the final completion run of an LLM is the right approach.  What mix of forced grounding context injection, dynamic tool calling to get grounding context, sub-agents summarizing from larger bodies to then inject summarized / shortened grounding context etc gives the best bang for the buck?   TBH from production experience, it's still very situation and data specific.  For a fast follower team that does not have the capacity to try out every frontline technology development, an off the shelf (e.g. GCP APIs based) vector store plus reranker plus grounding into a fast model with large context is still going to be a decent outcome IF (!!!) the use case is actually a fit for it and IF (!!) they put a lot of effort in the preparation, custom chunking, extraction, tagging of their content.     \n  \nMy unscientific thesis is that \"standard\" RAG setups are used way to much on a) bad data b) the wrong use case,  not that they are fundamentally bad.    \n  \nAnother thesis: The general approach of rather providing situationally dynamic context vs. relying on foundation model fact knowledge is here to stay until we have models that can be incrementally and continuously trained or tuned at very low cost (and even then, the question is up whether this provides better hallucination control than grounding in the generation context).",

It keeps retrieval portable, deterministic, and easy to debug with stable chunk/card IDs, source text hashes, and reproducible index builds.\n\nFor vectors, when I say “fallback,” I mean I don’t always run semantic search. (a) It can add noise for queries that are heavy on entities, where lexical search performs better; and (b) it increases complexity and cost if used on every query. But when semantic does kick in, say, too few FTS hits or low lexical confidence,  I follow the exact flow you described: run vector search - merge results - rerank - return top-K. I also log diagnostics like backend used, hit counts, scores, and latency.\n\nThat said, I haven’t rolled out embeddings-based retrieval in production yet. The current setup is FTS-first, paired with structured state and ledgers. The hybrid approach is next on the roadmap, once I can safely gate it behind a “semantic miss” golden set to avoid silent drift.\n\nCurious, what’s worked best for you in terms of rerankers or thresholding?",

I run semantic alongside FTS, merge the candidates, then rerank.\n\nAlways-on semantic can work great if your infra can handle it and your domain benefits from it. But honestly, in more entity-heavy setups, I’ve seen it add noise or make things harder to debug. I’ve had better luck gating it behind a simple confidence check instead of making it the default.\n\nCurious what kind of domain you're working in.

How does it know how to search for it if the user gives terrible keywords, how does it know if should look elsewhere? It's not a listable directory to explore to gain insight from, and that's the problem. The agent only knows whats in it's system prompt until it's found something, and then it's still ignorant about potentially other useful things it didn't find. This breaks down further when data is less organized, like code or loose pdfs\n\nBut the fact that you're comparing RAG lookup to a directory is concerning. Vector and graph databases do not work like that at all. The problem of retrieval is partially because they don't work like that.",

      "text": "I tested GPT-5.3 Codex and Claude Opus 4.6 shortly after release to see what actually happens once you stop prompting and start expecting results. Benchmarks are easy to read. Real execution is harder to fake.\n\nBoth models were given the same prompts and left alone to work. The difference showed up fast.\n\nCodex doesn’t hesitate. It commits early, makes reasonable calls on its own, and keeps moving until something usable exists. You don’t feel like you’re co-writing every step. You kick it off, check back, and review what came out. That’s convenient, but it also means you sometimes get decisions you didn’t explicitly ask for.\n\nOpus behaves almost the opposite way. It slows things down, checks its own reasoning, and tries to keep everything internally tidy. That extra caution shows up in the output. Things line up better, explanations make more sense, and fewer surprises appear at the end. The tradeoff is time.\n\nA few things stood out pretty clearly:\n\n* Codex optimizes for momentum, not elegance\n* Opus optimizes for coherence, not speed\n* Codex assumes you’ll iterate anyway\n* Opus assumes you care about getting it right the first time\n\nThe interaction style changes because of that. Codex feels closer to delegating work. Opus feels closer to collaborating on it.\n\nNeither model felt “smarter” than the other. They just burn time in different places. Codex burns it after delivery. Opus burns it before.\n\nIf you care about moving fast and fixing things later, Codex fits that mindset. If you care about clean reasoning and fewer corrections, Opus makes more sense.\n\nI wrote a longer breakdown [here](https://www.tensorlake.ai/blog/claude-opus-4-6-vs-gpt-5-3-codex) with screenshots and timing details in the full post for anyone who wants the deeper context.",

In that sense, it was absolutely worthless spending my tokens on it.  \nBut what if I used Sonnet for it? it would have been maybe worse.  \nAnd these are the things that you don't want to do yourself, and want to hand over to AI.

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI don't have the compute to train on 100B tokens or write a formal paper right now, so I'm dropping this here for the community to play with.\n\n**The Idea: \"WorkerTransformer\"**\n\nStandard Transformers are inefficient because every single token performs expensive Attention ($O(T^(2)$)) and FFN ($O(T)$) updates. But does every token really need to \"think\" deeply?\n\nI built a sparse-update architecture based on a simple intuition:\n\n1. **Divide & Conquer**: Split tokens into **Workers** (every 4th token) and **Memory** (the rest).\n2. **Workers**: Do the heavy lifting (Full Attention + FFN).\n3. **Memory**: Only do a cheap depthwise conv1d to capture local context (like Mamba/ConvNets) but **skip** the heavy Transformer block.\n4. **In-place Update**: Everything happens in-place. No extra tokens added, no sequence inflation.\n\n**The Result (on T=1024 sequence length):**\n\nI ran a \"battle\" between a Standard Transformer and my WorkerTransformer (same params, layers, dim) on a fixed 5-minute training budget.\n\n* **Standard Transformer**: 3.2 steps/s | Reached Val Loss **1.44**\n* **WorkerTransformer**: 8.0 steps/s (**2.5x speedup**) | Reached Val Loss **1.30**\n\nThe \"lazy\" model didn't just run faster; because it ran 2.5x more steps in the same timeframe, it actually learned **more** and achieved a significantly lower loss. It seems the trade-off of \"sparse compute vs. more iterations\" heavily favors sparse compute here.\n\n**Why I'm sharing this:**\n\nI suspect this could scale. The architecture is **pure PyTorch** (no custom CUDA kernels needed), making it dead simple to modify.\n\nIf you have spare A100s or are looking for a weekend project, I'd love to see someone scale this up to WikiText-103 or RedPajama.\n\n**Code & Benchmarks:** [https://github.com/SuiltaPico/WorkerTransformer](https://github.com/SuiltaPico/WorkerTransformer)\n\nLet me know if you find any flaws in my reasoning or if you manage to break it!",

          "text": "This is truly valuable data. However, I feel that benchmarks and other metrics are unfortunately no longer providing anything beyond a general overview. The situation has become so multifaceted that it is becoming quite frustrating. To clarify: a 4B model specifically designed for translation can outperform an 80B model. Furthermore, the quality between different levels of quantization is, regrettably, inconsistent. I also suspect that many current models are being specifically fine-tuned to inflate these benchmark scores.\n\nIn my view, empirical experience is paramount. For instance, I have observed significant performance gaps between Q8 and Q4 quantization, particularly in MoE models. While a model like GPT-OSS 20B might be too 'clumsy' for my specific workflows, another user might prefer it over GPT-4. It ultimately depends on your specific use case. Because I utilize long, complex system prompts that require strict adherence to sequential instructions, models like GLM-4.7 or Granite 4 yield better results for me than Qwen 80B. For others, the opposite may be true.\n\nThe difference between Q4 and Q8 becomes especially pronounced in extended tasks where a structured 'flow' isn't utilized; a single logical error can lead to an irreversible divergence in the output. However, if a multi-model flow is implemented where each model is assigned a single task, Q4 is often sufficient. That said, I have encountered cases where a Qwen 30B (A3B) at Q8 provided answers that even a Qwen 80B at Q4 could not. I realize, of course, that many might disagree with this assessment.",

      "text": "I’ve been looking at per-task results on SWE-Bench Verified and noticed something that leaderboard averages hide: different models consistently solve *different* subsets of tasks.\n\nEven the top overall model on the leaderboard fails a non-trivial number of tasks that other models reliably solve, and the reverse is also true. This suggests strong task-level specialization rather than one model being strictly better.\n\nTo test this, I built a **Mixture-of-Models architecture**, which is different from traditional routing that just defaults to the strongest aggregate model most of the time. The goal isn’t to route to a single model as often as possible, but to exploit complementary strengths between models.\n\nConcretely:\n\n* The problem description is embedded\n* It’s assigned to a semantic cluster (learned from general coding data, not SWE-Bench)\n* Each cluster has learned per-model success statistics\n* The task is routed to the historically strongest model for that *type* of problem\n\nImportantly, this does **not** route the top aggregate model for the majority of tasks. Several clusters consistently route to other models where they outperform it, even though it has the highest overall score.\n\nThere’s no new foundation model, no test-time search, and no repo execution, just a lightweight gating mechanism over multiple models.\n\nUsing this Mixture-of-Models setup, the system reaches 75.6% on SWE-Bench, exceeding single-model baselines (\\~74%). The takeaway isn’t the absolute number, but the mechanism: leaderboard aggregates hide complementary strengths, and mixture architectures can capture a higher ceiling than any single model.\n\nBlog with details and methodology here: [https://nordlyslabs.com/blog/hypernova](https://nordlyslabs.com/blog/hypernova)\n\nGithub: the framework is open source ! [https://github.com/Nordlys-Labs/nordlys](https://github.com/Nordlys-Labs/nordlys)\n\nML/AI Research Community Discord: [https://discord.gg/dqW7BBrq](https://discord.gg/dqW7BBrq)",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been working on an open-source project called **IRon**: a local-first AI assistant focused on automation, not chat.\n\nThe main idea is:\n\nInstead of using LLMs to “think” and generate long text, IRon translates user input into a small structured format (IR – Intermediate Representation) and executes real tools.\n\nSo most tasks don’t need heavy models.\n\n# What it does\n\nIRon works mainly through Telegram and runs locally.\n\nPipeline:\n\nUser → Router → (optional LLM) → IR (JSON) → Tools → Result\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Deterministic router for common tasks (notes, lists, commands, etc.)\n* Dual output: short human reply + machine IR\n* Tool system (shell, docker, http, code exec, notes, scheduler, addons)\n* Cron-based scheduler\n* Codex/Ollama support for complex reasoning\n* Session isolation per chat\n* Addon system for external tools/adapters\n\n# Why I built it\n\nMost “AI assistants” today:\n\n* Burn tokens on simple things\n* Re-explain everything\n* Don’t integrate well with real systems\n* Lose context easily\n\nI wanted something closer to:\n\n“Natural language → compact instruction → real execution”\n\nLike a mix of:\n\n* cron\n* Makefile\n* shell\n* and LLMs\n\nBut with safety and structure.\n\n# Example\n\nUser:  \n“Remind me to pay rent tomorrow at 9”\n\nIRon:\n\n* Generates IR\n* Schedules cron\n* Uses scheduler tool\n* Confirms in one line\n\nNo long explanation. No wasted tokens.\n\n# Tech stack\n\n* Go\n* Telegram Bot API\n* Codex CLI / Ollama (future)\n* JSON-based IR\n* robfig/cron\n* Plugin system\n\nCurrent status\n\nIt’s usable and evolving.  \nMain focus now:\n\n* DSL for tasks\n* Better scheduling\n* Memory without huge context\n* More deterministic routing\n\n**It's in progress, so there are bugs yet, let me know if you can help.**\n\n# Repo\n\n[https://github.com/iagomussel/IRon](https://github.com/iagomussel/IRon?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n# Looking for feedback\n\nI’m interested in feedback on:\n\n* Architecture\n* IR format\n* DSL ideas\n* Similar projects\n* Security concerns\n\nIf you’re into local AI, automation, or agent systems, I’d love your thoughts.\n\nThanks 🙌",

That feels like a practical agent design: keep the LLM for the hard parsing/planning edges, but push everything into a constrained representation so execution stays predictable.\n\nHow are you thinking about schema evolution for the IR and safety around tool permissions (per chat/session)? Those two things seem to make or break local agents. Ive been reading a bunch about structured agents lately, this page has some good notes: https://www.agentixlabs.com/blog/",

Seventy percent on a calculator task.\n\nThe interesting part isn't that agents fail — everyone here knows that. It's that **single-run evals can't detect it.** If you run 10 trials and get 10/10, Wilson score CI at 95% confidence gives you [0.722, 1.000]. Your \"perfect\" result is statistically compatible with a system that fails 28% of the time.\n\nThis matters for CI/CD. Most teams either skip agent evals in their pipeline or run each test once and assert pass/fail. Both approaches have the same problem: they can't distinguish a 95%-reliable agent from a 70%-reliable one unless you run enough trials.\n\n**What actually works for catching regressions:**\n\nRun each test case N times (N >= 20 makes a real difference). Compute Wilson CI on the pass rate. Compare against your baseline using Fisher exact test instead of naive diff. Use Benjamini-Hochberg correction if you're testing multiple cases simultaneously — otherwise you'll get false alarms.\n\nFor failure attribution: group trials into pass/fail, compare tool call distributions at each step, pick the step with the lowest Fisher p-value. This gives you \"step 2 tool selection is the bottleneck\" instead of \"test failed.\"\n\nI open-sourced the framework I built for this: [agentrial](https://github.com/alepot55/agentrial). It wraps any Python callable and has adapters for LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, Pydantic AI, OpenAI Agents SDK, and smolagents. YAML config, runs in CI, exit code 1 on statistically significant regression.\n\n```\nbasic-math      20/20  CI=[0.839, 1.000]  PASS\nmulti-step      14/20  CI=[0.480, 0.862]  FAIL\n  → Step 2: tool selection diverges (p=0.003)\n```\n\nCurious how others are handling this. Are you running multi-trial evals in CI? Using soft thresholds? Something else entirely?\n",
