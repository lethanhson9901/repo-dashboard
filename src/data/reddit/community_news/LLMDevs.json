Last night I thought: why not tackle something massive?\n\nTook the Epstein Files dataset from Hugging Face (teyler/epstein-files-20k) – 2 million+ pages of trending news and documents. The cleaning, chunking, and optimization challenges are exactly what excites me.\n\nWhat I built:\n\n\\- Full RAG pipeline with optimized data processing\n\n\\- Processed 2M+ pages (cleaning, chunking, vectorization)\n\n\\- Semantic search & Q&A over massive dataset\n\n\\- Constantly tweaking for better retrieval & performance\n\n\\- Python, MIT Licensed, open source\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nIt’s trending, real-world data at scale, the perfect playground.\n\nWhen you operate at scale, every optimization matters. This project lets me experiment with RAG architectures, data pipelines, and AI performance tuning on real-world workloads.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG](https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG)\n\nOpen to ideas, optimizations, and technical discussions!",

      "text": "Hi r/LLMDevs,\n\nStjepan from Manning here. The mods said it's ok if I post this here. \n\nWe’ve just released a book that’s very much aimed at the kinds of problems this community discusses all the time: what to do when a general-purpose LLM is technically impressive but awkward, expensive, or inefficient for your actual use case.\n\n**Rearchitecting LLMs** by Pere Martra  \n[https://www.manning.com/books/rearchitecting-llms](https://hubs.la/Q042-hLy0)\n\n[Rearchitecting LLMs by Pere Martra](https://preview.redd.it/vyy079zx78jg1.jpg?width=2213&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=755a8b1ab1320ede5daedfa861d6ab8d1b0c5e5d)\n\nThe core idea of the book is simple but powerful: instead of treating open models as fixed artifacts, you can reshape them. Pere walks through structural techniques like targeted fine-tuning, pruning, and knowledge distillation to build smaller, cheaper, domain-focused models that still perform well on the tasks you care about.\n\nWhat makes this book interesting is how hands-on it gets. You’re not working with abstract toy networks. The examples focus on modifying widely used open models, such as Llama-3, Gemma, and Qwen. The focus is on understanding which parts of a model actually contribute to behavior, how to identify waste or redundancy, and how to remove or compress components without blindly wrecking performance.\n\nThere’s also some genuinely thoughtful material on combining behavioral analysis with structural changes. Instead of just cutting parameters and hoping for the best, the book explores ways to reason about why a modification works or fails. One section that tends to spark discussion is “fair pruning,” where pruning is used not only for efficiency but also to reduce bias at the neuron level.\n\nIf you’re working on local models, cost-constrained deployments, or specialized SLMs, this book is very much in that territory. It’s written for people who are comfortable with LLM concepts and want to go deeper into how models can be reshaped rather than simply prompted.\n\n**For the** r/LLMDevs **community:**  \nYou can get **50% off** with the code **MLMARTRA50RE**.\n\nA quick note on availability: the book is currently in **MEAP (Manning Early Access Program)**. That means you get immediate access to the chapters as they’re written, along with updates as the manuscript evolves.\n\nHappy to bring the author to answer questions about the book, the techniques it covers, or the kinds of readers it’s best suited for. And I’d be curious to hear from folks here who are already doing pruning or distillation in practice — what’s been harder than expected?\n\nI'm ready to give away 5 ebooks to the first five commenters who share their experience here.\n\nThank you all for having us. It feels great to be here.\n\nCheers,",

              "text": "Hi u/StackSmashRepeat \n\nI'll give you a rough explanation and if you want more details just ask me. \n\nIn the book I explain an LLM optimization / customization pipeline. The pipeline basically consists of: \n\n1- Pruning (depth and width) which is removing parts of a model. \n\n2- Knowledge Distillation. Recovering the lost knowledge by transferring it from the base model to the pruned one. \n\n3- Finetuning on a specialized domain. \n\nDuring this pipeline you gain knowledge about how models work internally, since to decide which parts to remove we study how activations are produced detecting the mos important parts. \n\nWe take advantage of this knowledge to do surgical operations on the model in the more advanced chapters, like replacing attention layers or changing the behaviour of the model modifying the weights of some neurons. \n\nThe pipeline is very similar to what companies like Nvidia or Mistral follow to create their model families, but adapted to create specific models,  and using less data and processing capacity than they have.   \n  \nFor example in width pruning Mistral uses a completely dynamic model to detect which weights to remove, in the book we use a combination that rewards keeping neurons with high importance, so with much less data you can get an efficient model. \n\nAlthough it really seems very complicated we start from the simplest things, basic depth pruning, in chapter 2 you already remove parts of a model and recover the lost knowledge. \n\nFrom this base you build the knowledge that leads you to the more advanced techniques. \n\nThen there's a second intention which is to make cutting-edge research understandable, so in each chapter starting from the fourth, there's an explanation of which papers the chapter's code is based on and how we've adapted it when implementing it. \n\nFor example the development of width pruning in modern models like Llama or Gemma is based on a paper which we've changed a good part of the formulas to simplify it but keeping its general idea. \n\nI hope the explanation was useful! \n\nPere.",

At the database layer, it mostly comes down to:\n\n* Managing connection lifecycle properly\n* Keeping transactions short\n* Handling long-lived sessions carefully (especially with streaming)\n* Using replicas effectively\n\nIf you mess up connection management, holdconnection hostage, everything falls apart. That’s usually the real bottleneck. With LLM systems, the bottleneck is about GPU compute and memory. The main things are:\n\n* Efficient batching of incoming requests\n* Maximizing GPU utilization\n* Managing KV cache memory properly\n* Supporting high concurrency\n\nModern frameworks like vLLM help a lot here. Things like paged attention, continuous batching, and FlashAttention make it possible to handle large numbers of concurrent requests efficiently. Memory management is critical, but these frameworks abstract a lot of that complexity away.\n\nSo DB scaling is mostly about connection discipline and replication strategy. LLM scaling is about batching efficiency and GPU orchestration.",

      "text": "Hey! I was recently hired to build an AI shopping assistant for a huge brand, 1B$+ in revenue. Unfortunately can't say which one is it (damn NDAs), but I thought I'd share some lessons. After the project CTO told me “Working with you was the best AI investment in the last year”, so I guess it went well!\n\nI'm reposting this from my linkedin, so sorry for this \"linkedinish\" vibe:\n\nThe biggest secret was, surprise, surprise, **not** wasn’t fancy AI methods, complex RAG pipelines, and multi step workflows. In the end it was good prompts, a bunch of domain-specific tools and one subagent.  \n  \nThe secret was the process.  \n  \nI didn’t know anything about skincare so I had to learn about it. Even light understanding of the domain turned out EXTREMELY IMPORTANT since it allowed m to play around with an agent and have a good judgement whether it says good things. The fastest feedback loop is always \"in your head\".   \n  \nI built a domain-specific dashboard for the client. A collaborative environment where domain experts can play around with an agent, comment, feedback, etc. I took the idea from [Hamel Husain](https://x.com/HamelHusain) who said that [“The Most Important AI Investment is A Simple Data Viewer”.](https://x.com/i/status/1991903412997509372) He was damn right about it.   \n  \nThe last thing is something that is not talked much about but it should. We got hundreds of files about company knowledge. This knowledge is spread around big organisations like crazy. But if you really really understand the domain, if you really digest it all and ask a lot of questions, you’ll be able to COMPRESS this knowledge. You’ll find common stuff, remove dead ends, and really narrow it down to sth that expresses most about this company in smallest piece of text. This is your system prompt!! Why split context and add a potential point of failure if you can have MOST of the important stuff always in the system prompt? It’s crazy how well it works.  \n  \nOn the context engineering side we ended up with a great system prompt + a bunch of tools for getting info about products. I added one subagent for more complex stuff (routine building), but that was the only “fancy” thing out there.  \n  \nI think the lesson here is that building agents is not hard on the technical level, and every developer can do it! The models do all the heavy lifting and they’re only getting better. The secret is understanding the domain and extracting the domain knowledge from people who know it. It's communication.\n\n  \nI'm curious:\n\nHave you built such \"customer support\"-related agents for your companies too? One thing that triggers me is amount of those giant SaaS companies that promises \"the super ultra duper ai agent\", and honestly? I think they don't have much secret sauce. Models are doing heavy lifting, and simple methods where heavy lifting is done by domain-specific knowledge trump general purpose ones. \n\nHere's what Malte from Vercel recently wrote btw:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h2pjrjfix1jg1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8cd25ac93ee3a1b92cab153a1c591edbaf35d78\n\nIt somehow clicks.",

If you've sold RAG solutions to clients, I'd love to hear about your experience:\n\n**Client & Project Details:**\n\n* What types of clients/industries did you work with?\n* How did they discover they needed RAG? (Did they come asking for it, or did you identify the use case?)\n* What was the scope? (customer support, internal knowledge base, document search, etc.)\n\n**Delivery & Timeline:**\n\n* How long did the project take from discovery to delivery?\n* What were the biggest technical challenges you faced?\n* Did you handle ongoing maintenance, or was it a one-time delivery?\n\n**Business Side:**\n\n* How did you find these clients? (freelance platforms, LinkedIn outreach, referrals, content marketing, etc.)\n* What did you charge? (ballpark is fine, just trying to understand market rates)\n* How did you structure pricing? (fixed project, hourly, monthly retainer?)\n\n**Post-Delivery:**\n\n* Were clients happy with the results?\n* Did you iterate/improve the system after launch?\n* Any lessons learned that you'd do differently next time?\n\nThanks !",

      "text": "Hey all,\n\nThis past summer I was interning as an SWE at a large finance company, and noticed that there was a huge initiative deploying AI agents. Despite this, almost all Engineering Directors I spoke with were complaining that the current agents had no ability to recall information after a little while (in fact, the company chatbot could barely remember after exchanging 6–10 messages).\n\nI discussed this grievance with some of my buddies at other firms and Big Tech companies and noticed that this issue was not uncommon (although my company’s internal chatbot was laughably bad).\n\nAll that said, I have to say that this \"memory bottleneck\" poses a tremendously compelling engineering problem, and so I am trying to give it a shot and am curious what you all think.\n\nAs you probably already know, vector embeddings are great for similarity search via cosine/BM25, but the moment you care about things like persistent state, relationships between facts, or how context changes over time, you begin to hit a wall.\n\nRight now I am playing around with a hybrid approach using a vector plus graph DB. Embeddings handle semantic recall, and the graph models entities and relationships. There is also a notion of a \"reasoning bank\" akin to the one outlined in Googles famous paper several months back. TBH I am not 100 percent confident that this is the right abstraction or if I am doing too much. \n\nHas anyone here experimented with structured or temporal memory systems for agents?\n\nIs hybrid vector plus graph reasonable, or is there a better established approach I should be looking at?\n\nAny and all feedback or pointers at this stage would be very much appreciated.",

I’d really appreciate your thoughts on a challenge I’m currently facing and whether you would approach it differently.\n\nUse-Case\n\nI’m building an **intent classifier** that must:\n\n* Run **on edge**\n* Stay around **\\~100ms latency**\n* Predict **1 out of 9 intent labels**\n* Consider **up to 2 previous conversation turns**\n\nThe environment is domain-specific (medical domain in reality), but to simplify, imagine a system controlling a car.\n\nExample:  \nYou have an intent like `lane_change`, and the user can request it in many different ways.\n\nCurrent Setup\n\n* Base model: **phi-3.5-mini-instruct**\n* Fine-tuned using **LoRA**\n* Model explicitly outputs only the intent token (e.g., `command_xyz`)\n* Each intent is mapped to a **single special token**\n* Almost no system prompt (removed to save tokens)\n\nPerformance:\n\n* \\~110ms latency (non-quantized) → acceptable\n* \\~10 input tokens on average\n* \\~5 output tokens on average\n* 25k training samples\n* \\~95% accuracy\n\nSpeed is not the main issue — I still have some room for token optimization and quantization if needed.\n\nthe real challenge -> the missing 5%.\n\nThe issue is **edge cases**.\n\nThe model operates in an open-input environment. The user can phrase requests in unlimited ways.\n\nFor example:  \nFor `lane_change`, there might be 30+ semantically equivalent variations. I built a synthetic data generation pipeline to create such variations and spent \\~2 weeks refining it. Evaluation suggests it's decent.\n\nBut:\n\nThere are still rare phrasings that the model hasn’t seen → wrong intent prediction.\n\nOf course, I can:\n\n* Iteratively collect misclassifications\n* Add them to the training set\n* Retrain\n\nBut that’s slow and reactive.\n\nConstraints:\n\n* I could use a larger model (e.g., phi-4), and I’ve tested it.\n* However, time-to-first-token for phi-4 is significantly slower.\n* Latency is more important than squeezing out a few extra percent of quality.\n\nSo scaling up model size isn’t ideal.\n\nMy questions to you:\n\nHow would you tackle the final 5%?\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing how others would approach this kind of edge, low-latency intent classification problem.\n\nThanks in advance!",

T5Gemma Style Models could be a solution, but I got no experience on fine tuning them.\n\nFourth you could apply additional techniques like reranking or building a similarity distance to sample sentences to make sure that your generation is a valid result.  Maybe good to combine this approaches with multiple generations of the result.\n\n\n\n",
