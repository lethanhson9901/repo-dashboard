I have played around with a few, but probably not enough to hit the sharp edges that might still exist. \n\nI like the dspy approach of automated prompt optimization and could see using that in addition to other tooling depending on the task. If it wasn't for my dislike of langchain because of how poor their docs have been, bad abstractions, poor defaults and visibility, ect, I would probably go with langgraph.\n\nI assume that pydanticAI being from the pydandic folks are more thoughtful about their design choices, have better docs, will be better engineered, ect.\n\nLooking for something that is helpful for building workflows and have good hooks in for validators. Human in the loop and being able to resume, replay, and have support for escalation in the quality of model used, maybe multiple generations would be nice too. Ideally could be based on a model router and also potentially the results of validators.\n\nIn general, goals are also the same as choosing other non-AI frameworks. Good defaults and good abstractions to make the typical use a bit easier, but still allow for stepping outside of the default approaches when it makes sense to do so and it being clear of what the defaults are and how to configure and build outside of that.

I’d like to specialize further in this area, but I’m unsure what the next career steps should be.\n\nSo far, in projects and POCs, I have worked on:\n\n* Prompt optimization and prompt engineering\n* Using vector databases and embeddings\n* Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, including GraphRAG and LightRAG\n* Working with frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, etc.\n* Fine-tuning LLMs\n\nI’m looking for guidance from people who work as **AI Engineers, LLM Engineers, or AI Specialists**.\n\nWhat would you consider the **next steps** to grow in this career path?\n\nImportant context:  \nI’m **not interested in developing AI models from scratch or diving into traditional Machine Learning**. My goal is to keep building **around existing AI/LLMs**, focusing on engineering, system design, and using frameworks and industry patterns to overcome model limitations and build production-ready solutions.\n\nAny advice, learning paths, or real-world insights would be greatly appreciated.",

I finally landed a hit product feature and saved my job essentially, but the whole job has been total chaos. \n \nStart thinking about how you can use all of those concepts you’ve just outlined to unlock new capabilities for your company.

I mean operacionalization of self hosted models (alongside with monitoring and analytics) has its tricks but its one more software layer we have to provide like we did with all inovative parts black then in time. Prompt management its a topic for sure but also something we can tackle with time. The usage of agents framework is yet another kind of framework to learn. The only thing really new here is fine tuning models but even this with the latest RAG techniques and the growing context of the models (alongside with the different architecture that are trying to increase hugely this) might not make sense to bet in most of the use cases. I Will foresee most of software developers being \"AI engineers\" on the coming years, so it will not be a career choice but rather a evolution of the common software Engineer.",

Groq's LPU chips claim 10x better power efficiency for inference. Deal structure seems designed to avoid antitrust scrutiny.\n* GitHub shipped Copilot memory (learns your codebase over time), Agent Skills (custom workflows), and added Claude Opus 4.5 + GPT-5.2 to all paid tiers.\n* Zhipu AI released GLM-4.7 open-weight. Matches Claude Sonnet 4.5 on coding benchmarks, $3/month or free if you run it locally. Works with Claude Code, Cline, etc.\n* OpenAI posted about hardening ChatGPT Atlas against prompt injection. Used RL to find exploits—one tricked the browser agent into sending a resignation letter. Their take: \"may never be fully solved.\"\n* Vercel shipped AI SDK 6 with agent support and human-in-the-loop approvals.\n* Cursor is building their own model + acquired Graphite for code review.",

      "text": "I am not really sure how to write this post. My first job was a dead-end data scientist job where I worked in a fintech startup and used python/sql to do a mix of:\n\n1. Managing quantitative finance products\n2. Not-that-useful-for-business-value unsupervised machine learning models that were run manually on an AWS compute instance with no MLOps\n3. Data pipelines for tableau dashboards/daily email reports\n4. Ad-hoc business analysis in notebooks\n\nIn my next job (with about a year of unemployment after the last one) I worked as a data scientist, but mostly did data engineering work and left after 6 months:\n\n1. Postgres and Airflow backend development\n2. Simple statistical models for analytics with SQL that were calculated in a tumbling-window\n\nI have always wanted to get a proper job in machine learning engineering, and I have some of the skills required (LLMs, simple neural networks/traditional ml, infrastructure, working with data, data engineering, MLOps system design, CI/CD) but don't have the advanced skills required for this job (eg: reinforcement learning, computer vision, GPU infrastructure, recommendation, forecasting, robotics/embedded systems) and the market for MLE/DS jobs is incredibly competitive.\n\nI have come to realize that **my work experience/education is inadequate to compete with other candidates in the incredibly competitive and high-compensation DS/MLE job market**. So, now I am trying to pivot to a full-stack AI engineer role where there is a greater emphasis on front-end and back-end web application development while having the responsibilities of an AI engineer to use existing models (Eg: LLMs, Multimodal models, Hugging face, fine-tuning) to design and create AI features.\n\nMy definition of MLE/AIE being:\n\n* MLE: Engineers who build their own models, create algorithms/advanced ML strategies to address business problems, have a strong academic background\n* AIE: Engineers who use existing foundation models to set up AI workflows, do not use advanced ML strategies (RL, CV, etc...) or develop algorithms, do not have a strong academic background\n\nI am simply unable to compete with others to get a pure ML/AI role, so my plan is to become a full-stack AI engineer so as to utilize my existing engineering skills (while learning more front-end), while not entirely wasting my skills in ML/AI. The academic requirements for a full-stack web dev position are lower, and this job market has more positions than ML/AI (albeit lower salary, but I just want to continue my career), so I think this is the best course of action I can take right now.\n\nIn order to a job like that, I am trying to position myself as a full-stack engineer **who is willing to understand the product/business and knows how to use AI models to design features in to can create tangible value for the company**. This might be a tall order, but it's the best plan I have right now to revive my career which has been slowly dying, and I am open to any ideas/suggestions that may help. Thank you in advance.\n\nI am currently working on a project that will hopefully get me considered for AI/full-stack engineer jobs. It is a multi-agent system that integrates with a hypothetical CRM system to responds to customer support emails by understanding the content of the email, categorising it into an appropriate action category (e.g., escalate, flag, response, etc), and taking whatever actions are necessary (e.g., checking transactions/claims/statuses, etc...) to address the support request in that category. Then the agent prepares a response to the email with a list of actions taken and contextual data gathered from internal systems, for staff to manually review before sending it to the client. This interface for staff is accessible through an authenticated front-end which displays the details of the customer support case, the actions taken by the agent, and the email response that the agent has prepared.",

You'll be happier working in the area you want to work in. It is always a benefit to be capable of understanding the business/business logic. That's what the data scientist brings the to ML/AI table. A lot of teams work in a black box from that perspective.\n\nUnderestimating yourself does no good. It's easy to lose confidence when you have a series of roles that just aren't it plus unemployment and oh yeah the economy. Been there (a different era) and it's a literal pit to crawl out of. Consider therapy. Even if you don't believe in it, building confidence = better interview outcomes.",

Those only represent where you started and vaguely point where you may be headed, in what I am reading to be most of your career and life in front of you. You are much more than a resume and should value and evaluate yourself as such.\n\nNow for the advice (that ties in to how you should view yourself): You make no mention of learning, doing and experimenting new skills or fields on your own in your spare time - your emphasis/excuse on education/work background is telling. Nobody knew their skills at birth - it was all learned. What I look for in employees and collaborators is meta recognition (do you know what you don't know) and a strong self-learning/improvement ethic. This is because setting an always-higher bar for yourself means the personal standard of work also naturally becomes almost perfectionist. And as an employer and a project manager, I demand high output quality standards. Skills can be taught, attitude is your problem. And with the speed in which IT is moving, a passive attitude regarding your own skill set will leave you right back in unemployment land 5 years later - if you're lucky to hold on that long. Remember the prompt engineers at the height of COVID?\n\nI see that you are trying to reposition and pivot, and I applaud the attempt. But I believe you must also just dive in head-first and just develop the skills on your own time you already know will significantly elevate your chances of snagging that job you want. Gemini, Claude, Perplexity are your friends right now. Tap them for ideas and approaches to the most important skills and just do it. I have a child in his last year of college majoring in ComSci. I know how competitive and tough it is especially in the job market right now. It is palpable. But it is also true that chance favors the prepared mind. Don't blow any opportunity that may (and probably will) present itself in front of you in the future because your school and past jobs didn't give you the skills you needed to snag that opportunity. If you find yourself making that excuse, you deserve exactly what is coming.\n\nYou have incredible potential. Hell, I still feel that I still have potential left to develop and study every day. Don't be your greatest antagonist by believing that somehow you are simply a finished product of your past.",

Optimal is that they can scan a list of 5-10 things you’ve made, identify the 2-3 that lines up with their needs, and take a quick peek at those.\n\nI’ve hired a fair number of developers in a past life as a startup guy. People who do projects on their own, determining what to make and building it, are a way safer hiring bet than anyone who’s portfolio is all things made at their jobs - anyone can portfolio by being in a team, there’s no way to know if they did any of that work, or if they were actually slowing said team down.\n\nOn the other hand someone who has self-built portfolio goes straight to the front of the line, you’re almost guaranteed that they can get stuff done. The very first question I want to know from people is “so, do you ever code stuff for yourself, personal projects, for fun - anything like that?” An enthusiastic “yes check this out!” Is the best possible evidence that they’re gonna be effective.\n\nSo step 1 is to bang out 5-10 1 week demos, put them on a public portfolio website with a screenshot and 5 paragraphs each, and distribute them across the techs and keywords for the jobs you want. Some humans will read it, many will just ask AI about you, so make sure both will be able to find it easily, drive them there from the top of any materials you submit etc.\n\nStep 2 is don’t bother applying to jobs. There are so many people going for jobs once they’re posted,  it’s effectively a lottery. You should identify companies you want to work at proactively, locate the people in related roles you want to work for or with on LinkedIn, and connect with them directly. For every job that gets posted, there is an unposted need that if you reach out, they can create the position for you.",

Our AIE team works closely with product and platform engineering.\n* **Scrappiness and breadth.** Many of us on the team are or were avid hackathon participants. A lot of our work starts as experimentation where we vibe code a product end-to-end, demo it to stakeholders, and if it gains traction, we put it into production (some of our AI products serve millions of users). We value people who can cobble things together quickly and also have the engineering discipline to take it to production safely.\n* **Genuine curiosity.** The field changes every week, and it's very evident when a candidate is genuinely excited about those developments and tinkers with the latest AI coding tools, APIs, and models versus a candidate who read five blog posts on RAG the day before the interview.\n\nThere's a lot more to say here.

      "text": "Hello everyone, I am building no code platform where users can build RAG agents in seconds.\n\nI am building it on AWS with S3, Lambda, RDS, and Zilliz (Milvus Cloud) for vectors. But holy crap, costs were creeping up FAST: storage bloating, memory hogging queries, and inference bills.\n\nStoring raw documents was fine but oh man storing uncompressed embeddings were eating memory in Milvus.\n\nThis is where I found the solution:\n\nWhile scrolling X, I found the solution and implemented immediately.\n\nSo 1 million vectors is roughly 3 GB uncompressed.\n\nI used Binary quantization with RABITQ (32x magic), (Milvus 2.6+ advanced 1-bit binary quantization)\n\nIt converts each float dimension to 1 bit (0 or 1) based on sign or advanced ranking.\n\nSize per vector: 768 dims × 1 bit = 96 bytes (768 / 8 = 96 bytes)\n\nCompression ratio: 3,072 bytes → 96 bytes = \\~32x smaller.\n\nBut after implementing this, I saw a dip in recall quality, so I started brainstorming with grok and found the solution which was adding SQ8 refinement.\n\n* Overfetch top candidates from binary search (e.g., 3x more).\n* Rerank them using higher-precision SQ8 distances.\n* Result: Recall jumps to near original float precision with almost no loss.\n\nMy total storage dropped by 75%, my indexing and queries became faster.\n\nThis single change (RaBitQ + SQ8) was game changer. Shout out to the guy from X.\n\nLet me know what your thoughts are or if you know something better.\n\nP.S.

One thing I've noticed with similar systems is that the quality of your underlying document retrieval can make or break the whole feedback loop. If your agent is pulling in poorly chunked or irrelevant context during those teaching conversations, the human expert ends up correcting retrieval issues rather than actually teaching domain knowledge.\n\nHave you experimented much with how the document processing affects the teaching quality? I'm curious whether you've seen cases where the agent struggles to learn because the foundational documents feeding into those conversations aren't being parsed or chunked in a way that preserves the important contextual relationships.",

In the background, there is an agent that has access to a terminal. The agent uses bash commands like grep and sed to figure out which portion of the docs are relevant to the current task. \n\nThe downside of agentic search is that it uses more tokens than RAG. But the upside is that it allows the agent to find information more accurately. You no longer rely on chunking/small embedding model to find relevant info. Instead, you use the LLM to decide whats relevant, which is often more accurate.\n\nI am not saying RAG is no good. I used agentic search because it was easier to implement for me.\n\nRegarding your question about chunking hurting important context, there are a bunch of more advanced RAG techniques out there, eg agentic RAG, contextual RAG. My understanding is that they are made to address that problem, and should outperform default RAG (at the cost of additional tokens).\n\nHope this helps. Happy to discuss more!",

Id store the name of the embedding model per collection (if my requirement is to query only one collection at a time) so that i could support multiple embedding models and query them based on the collection's model. I could start using the new model without migrating anything and also would give me a chance to see how better the new model is and assess if it is worth the migration. If the legacy collections could benefit from the new embedding model I'd consider reindexing in phases gradually.\n\nIf the requirement was to query on one global collection, I would create a new collection for the new embedding - > index the content - > do A/B testing - > remove the old collection.\n\nSo it really depends on your product and use-cases. I think the key here is to measure and see if there is any benefit of using the new model before you spend a fortune to reindex the whole content.

When I began two months ago, looking into all this stuff cause I felt like finally the LLMs could do coding good enough and I wanted to see if I could do some crazy shit. I immediately identified that small models have power for the community and the user base and it’s particular the efficacy of small models compared to larger models is not large enough of a gap to not try to optimize smaller models and once I learned more about LLM‘s, I decided that we needed to do geographical mapping because this really is a physical dimension of thought, or comparatively a physical realization of semantics. This is to map out - and the site currently has mock data but my idea branches out once you start trying to design an experiment. And I think it’s important to point out. This is PHI2 and PHI3 is just as relevant in different capacities. It’s built a little bit differently than PHI2 but the weights come from PHI2 so the experimental inference that is needed is large and massive, but the relevancy of the inference that we can attain eventually is going to be Paramount in my opinion and possibly even a paradigm shift.  Anyway - another idea, I have involves using models to train models, smaller than them by cross referencing outputs, but we can’t really do that until we understand how any model and I just chose PHI2, works on the inside. https://philab.technopoets.net/ && https://github.com/Everplay-Tech/PHILAB",

We need to do a lot of tool calling as we have internal tools that are quite parameter heavy and unique to our architecture, and DeepFabric has been really a game changer here. You outline your Tools / parameters, seed a root topic and it creates reasoning datasets with many examples of Tools being called by the model. This dataset then gets pushed to hugging face and we pull it down into a training run and do supervised fine tuning with unsloth. At the end we then evaluate how well the training went by using DeepFabric to perform an evaluation - for this we split off a small amount of the dataset to give the model a blind evaluation. Everything gets logged to wand , we then push the model to huggingface where we then deploy it to AWS. \n\n  \n[https://github.com/always-further/deepfabric](https://github.com/always-further/deepfabric) \n\n[https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/unsloth-notebooks](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/unsloth-notebooks)",

Functions get split mid-implementation, class definitions get separated from their methods, import statements lose context. Most people chunk by line count or file size and wonder why their retrieval misses obvious dependencies.\n\nThe file selection problem is harder than it looks. You need to understand call graphs, dependency trees, and which files actually relate to the error patterns in the ticket. If you're chunking a React component but missing the hook it depends on, your agents are working with incomplete information.\n\nWhat kills me is how many teams discover their code chunking is broken only after they've already embedded everything. You can't see what went wrong until you're deep into agent conversations getting weird responses about missing imports or incomplete function signatures. I ended up building [VectorFlow](https://vectorflow.dev/?utm_source=redditCP_c) to debug this stuff before it hits the vector store because debugging RAG without seeing your processed code chunks is like coding blindfolded.\n\nWhat's your current thinking on handling cross-file dependencies? Are you planning to chunk at the function level or preserve larger logical units?",

      "text": "Hi,\n\nI'm an experienced developer with around 12 years professional experience in various businesses.\n\nCurrently I am working on a side project to learn more about RAG /LLms / AI development in general. Last time I did AI development was around 2018 when I was working with Dialogflow / categorization.\n\nI am a .NET developer, so by habit I went for Azure, and the OpenAI SDK with Azure Foundry.\n\nTo learn more about it, I went with an idea to build a \"recipe maker\" bot. The idea is that a user should be able to write \"I want to bake a chocolate cake\" / \"I want to make lassagna\" etc.\n\nI also created my vector database with various categories (diary/meat/pasta) and so on.\n\nCurrently what I got working is that my LLM takes the user input ,and returns generic ingredients required to cook whatever the user asks for. The LLM might return \"eggs / diary / flour\" etc as a strict JSON schema, and I can do a vector search towards my DB to get the required categories, and items.\n\nBut what I am struggeling with is if the user asks like \"It will be for 12 persons\", or \"I already have milk, please remove it\".\n\nWhat would be the best way to do some adjustments / calculation based on this kind of user input? Would that be in a system prompt, the JSON schema?\n\nCurrently I am saving a DTO with an initial \"RecipeState\" that I always feed as context to subsequent queries by the user, but I cannot really grasp how I should make this kind of logic, and where it belongs.",

          "text": "The state management piece you're hitting is where most recipe bots get messy. Your RecipeState DTO approach is on the right track, but the logic placement matters.\n\nFor adjustments like \"for 12 persons\" or \"remove milk\", I'd handle this in your application layer, not the system prompt. The LLM should identify the intent and extract the parameters (serving size: 12, exclude: [\"milk\"]), then your code does the math and filtering. System prompts get unwieldy when you're trying to make them do calculations and state mutations.\n\nYour JSON schema should include fields for these modifiers. Something like `servingSize`, `excludeIngredients`, `includeIngredients`. Then your application logic scales quantities and filters the vector search results before returning to the user.\n\nThe RecipeState becomes your source of truth. Each user message updates it, and you always pass the current state when generating new responses. This keeps the conversation coherent without forcing the LLM to remember everything.\n\nWhere are you storing the RecipeState between messages? If it's just in memory, you'll lose context when the session ends. Most people end up persisting it to maintain longer conversations.",

The first agent I built was a [secret santa gift generator](https://agentyard.co/secret-ai-santa), but today I want to share my next one: [The Swag agent.](https://agentyard.co/customer-gifts) 👚🎒\n\nThis one in particular was inspired from our team who was handing our customer holiday gift campaign. We were trying to build custom storefronts with our swag, and ways on how to make it personal for our customers. We realized that AI agents could be the perfect thing to use for this.\n\n(i) it's going to be a fun experiment to see how these agents will work for this task  \n(ii) it'll make for an interesting customer experience \n\nWatch my [somewhat short demo](https://youtu.be/hWsIBFvxbco) (\\~3min) for all the details on how I built this one.\n\nBut generally here's how it works:\n\n\\- Customer adds their hobbies/passion + shipping info  \n\\- Agent decides what to get them  \n\\- Agent designs a custom swag option  \n\\- Agent creates draft order and shipping details  \n\\- Human reviews the order\n\nThe agent workflow has access to 6 different tools, but it generally has a pretty simple architecture.\n\nPS: Not a promo. These are free demo agents I’m building to explore better patterns and techniques. You can run them yourself and learn from how they’re put together.",
