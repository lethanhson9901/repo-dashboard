      "text": "I just finished reading *Agentic Design Patterns: A Hands-On Guide to Building Intelligent Systems*, and wanted to share some thoughts from an LLM dev perspective.\n\nThe author, Antonio Gulli (Google Cloud AI), clearly writes from an engineering background. This isn’t a trends or hype book — it’s very focused on how to actually structure agentic systems that go beyond single-call prompting.\n\nWhat the book focuses on\n\nInstead of models or benchmarks, the book frames agent development around **design patterns**, similar to classic software engineering.\n\nIt addresses a question many of us run into:\n\nHow do you turn LLM calls into reliable, multi-step, long-running systems?\n\nThe book is organized around \\~20 agentic patterns, including:\n\n* Prompt chaining, routing, and planning\n* Tool use and context engineering\n* Memory, RAG, and adaptation\n* Multi-agent coordination and communication\n* Guardrails, evaluation, and failure recovery\n\nMost chapters include concrete code examples (LangChain / LangGraph / CrewAI / Google tooling), not just conceptual diagrams.\n\nWhat I found useful as a dev\n\nPersonally, the biggest value was:\n\n* A clearer **mental model for agent workflows**, not just “agent = loop”\n* Better intuition for when to decompose into multiple agents vs a single one\n* Practical framing of context engineering and memory management\n* Realistic discussion of limitations (reasoning, evaluation, safety)\n\nIt helped me reason more systematically about why many agent demos break down when you try to scale or productize them.\n\nWho this is probably for\n\n* LLM devs building agentic workflows or internal tools\n* People moving from single-call pipelines to multi-step systems\n* Engineers thinking about production reliability, not just demos\n\nIf you’re mostly interested in model internals or training, this may not be your thing. If you’re focused on **system design around LLMs**, it’s worth a look.\n\nIf anyone here has read it, I’d be curious to hear your take.",

      "text": "I've heard the \"it just does autocomplete based on statistical analyses\" argument a million times. Everybody acts like it's self explanatory and obvious but I can't quite make the connection.\n\n  \nI understand if somebody asks \"what's Tokyo's population\", how it would get you an answer. However, sometimes it almost seems like understands questions and I know that's not the case. I'll give you a couple of examples:\n\n1.  The \"how many Rs in strawberry\" famous question. Though it used to fail that one, it seems like it attempts reasoning somehow. I don't understand how statistical data analysis would lead it to go back and forth with you trying to solve the riddle.  I'm sure nobody actually asked that question online and had conversations like that.\n2.  How does it do math? Again, the problems you ask it can get very specific with an untried combination of numbers. Clearly it does something more than predict the words, no?\n3.  I usually slam it on its coding abilities; specifically semantic understanding of what needs to be done. I can understand boiler plate code etc. but just sometimes when I ask it to debug what went wrong in my code, it actually provides a seemingly thoughtful answer, solving the problem on a \"thinking\" level. Did it just see that reply somewhere? But how could it have deduced that was the problem from the code, unless someone somewhere asked the same sentence before pasting the code?\n4.  I ask it to roleplay as a custom character for a video game or whatever. I give him a custom set of instructions and a background etc. It seems to reply in character, and when it tries to, for example, reference his home town, it's not just like \" `\"Been a while since I've been in \" + hometown + \".\"`. It kind of makes up lore about it or uses alternative ways to reference it. How does it do that?\n\n  \nI know it's not magic, but I don't understand how it works. The general \"it's just a glorified autocomplete\" doesn't satisfy my curiosity. Can somebody explain to me how it does seemingly semantic things?\n\nThanks.\n\n  \n",

Have it complete the next word or sentence, then delete that sentence / play with the preceding context and see what other sentence comes out instead. \n\nDoing this enough and at different conversation lengths has the model learn what to pay attention to and how to inch closer to the correct result regardless. \n\nIt reconfigures its weights to achieve this, it's not learning the answers at that point, they're just a side effect of the main goal of learning how to be more likely to say the right thing.\n\n---\n\nBecause there's a finite set of weights to configure, the model has to come up with a good way to cram all that information in so it distills the knowledge and the techniques to get to the answers which happens to be similar to how we learn but less advanced.\n\nThis is why the models can get mixed up and hallucinate - \"The capital of Japan is Paris\" - the data is close together but not wired up correctly but it will get better with more training. \n\nInference time scaling is just a higher order autocomplete: perhaps there was another thing it learnt - \"The capital of France is Paris, but wait - I said Paris was the capital of Japan so that can't be right\" - it can use other things it has been trained on to connect concepts out loud, this might correlate highly to similar lines of reasoning that the model can use as a tool for the current line of thinking.",

Words have meaning so \"understanding\" or heavily connecting with relationships between words allows LLMs to generate value based on those relationships\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qXtNvfxBzlk",

          "text": "The short answer is we don't know exactly how they work. We know the architecture, but how it actually works is based on its own learning and the networks are way too complex for us to understand what's it's learnt. But in some simple situations we have looked at the networks and understood what it's done.  \n\n\n>Sam Altman Says OpenAI Doesn’t Fully Understand How GPT Works Despite Rapid Progress\n“We certainly have not solved interpretability,” Altman said.\n[https://observer.com/2024/05/sam-altman-openai-gpt-ai-for-good-conference/](https://observer.com/2024/05/sam-altman-openai-gpt-ai-for-good-conference/)\n\n>During that training process, they learn their own strategies to solve problems. These strategies are encoded in the billions of computations a model performs for every word it writes. They arrive inscrutable to us, the model’s developers. **This means that we don’t understand how models do most of the things they do.**\n[https://www.anthropic.com/news/tracing-thoughts-language-model](https://www.anthropic.com/news/tracing-thoughts-language-model)\n\nSo the Rs in strawberry is due to the fact it doesn't get each letter, the word strawberry is broken up into tokens like \"straw\" and \"berry\" and those turned into vectors. So all the LLM has is say two vectors and those vectors might not have anything about the letters in straw and berry. \n\n>How does it do math? \n\nThis is a really interesting question. Anthropic have done some studies on this exact question and for simple addition, they use a bespoke algorithm that has two parts an estimation part and an accuracy part. So it doesn't add up numbers like a human would normally do or how a human would program a computer would do. It's learnt this completely new method. \n\nIn terms of autocomplete, anthropic have demonstrated that it uses algorithms and multistep reasoning rather than just memorising data and looking things up. \n\n\n>Claude wasn't designed as a calculator—it was trained on text, not equipped with mathematical algorithms. Yet somehow, it can add numbers correctly \"in its head\". How does a system trained to predict the next word in a sequence learn to calculate, say, 36+59, without writing out each step?\n>\n>Maybe the answer is uninteresting: the model might have memorized massive addition tables and simply outputs the answer to any given sum because that answer is in its training data. Another possibility is that it follows the traditional longhand addition algorithms that we learn in school.\n>\n>Instead, we find that Claude employs multiple computational paths that work in parallel. One path computes a rough approximation of the answer and the other focuses on precisely determining the last digit of the sum. These paths interact and combine with one another to produce the final answer. Addition is a simple behavior, but understanding how it works at this level of detail, involving a mix of approximate and precise strategies, might teach us something about how Claude tackles more complex problems, too.\n[https://www.anthropic.com/news/tracing-thoughts-language-model](https://www.anthropic.com/news/tracing-thoughts-language-model)\n\n\n>if asked \"What is the capital of the state where Dallas is located?\", a \"regurgitating\" model could just learn to output \"Austin\" without knowing the relationship between Dallas, Texas, and Austin. Perhaps, for example, it saw the exact same question and its answer during its training.\n>\nBut our research reveals something more sophisticated happening inside Claude. When we ask Claude a question requiring multi-step reasoning, we can identify intermediate conceptual steps in Claude's thinking process. In the Dallas example, we observe Claude first activating features representing \"Dallas is in Texas\" and then connecting this to a separate concept indicating that “the capital of Texas is Austin”. In other words, the model is combining independent facts to reach its answer rather than regurgitating a memorized response.\n[https://www.anthropic.com/news/tracing-thoughts-language-model](https://www.anthropic.com/news/tracing-thoughts-language-model)\n\nThat anthropic article is really good and has other examples, worth a read.\n\nSomeone else also pasted this link, so I'd just emphasise it's an amazing video worth watching.\n\n# The most complex model we actually understand\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8GOeCFFby4",

The reason is that the higher the number are the less likely they are even included in the trainingsset. S8nce LLM are a model that outputs the token with the highest probability the math equation (including the result) needs to be in the trainingset otherwise it essentialy outputs a random number. For \"Thinking models\" which is essentially the same base model but with a two step approach where you try to first break down the initial prompt by planning out a path to solution which provides useful context to shift the probability in the right direction. This context might include solving strategies such as removing zeros. Since 12+13 is in the training data it can solve it now the context or the final stage just needs to figure out that it has to add 3 zeros to the end which is most likely part of the training set too and even probability wise very likely. Therefore thinking models can even solve stuff thats not part of there trainings set.The fun thing is the llm actually don't know if the answer is correct but it will tell you it's correct with out a doubt. Since the thinking models will still fail for slightly more complex math questions calculator tool calls exist because LLMs are still really bad at calculating since they simply don't \"understand\" logic.\n\n\n(some parts are simplified to make easier to understand)",

The way to achieve this is by creating an information bottleneck where you force compression. \n\nGiven enough model complexity there really is no obvious limit to how complex an idea can be passed through this compression system. Consequently it’s auto complete yes but in order to complete every sentence ever written you must necessarily compress semantic understanding at some level.\n\nThe main reason people think these models “don’t understand” is actually not related to what they do but how we train them to do it. \n\nTheir internal representations are entangled and not perfectly able to be isolated. This in turn leads to “hallucinations” and other artifacts that sometimes clouds what it is they are doing. \n\nThat we initialize and train them the way we do is mostly not because we can’t conceive of better ways but because of the pragmatic convenience of the way we do it and the quite good performance we do get. We are still in the infancy of having enough compute to apply these techniques as we do so convenience is still a significant driver.\n\nAs the tech matures however and the compute available continues to grow different implementations will be tried that will likely significantly improve performance without necessarily invalidating the “it’s just fancy autocomplete” talking point.\n\nIn case you are interested I’m alluding to the ideas of continuous learning, and neuro evolutionary learning rather than direct gradient descent from random initialization. And that’s just assuming transformer architecture. There is so much more in the modern ml toolbox that just hast been brought to bear at the same scale as these models",

Instead, simply tag them as Model A, B, C, etc.\n* More importantly, tone down your step 3 prompt a bit, especially on the “find errors” part. All the counsel, quorum, debate, and peer-review workflows can have a significant impact on the quality of the output, both positively and negatively. The crucial point is to determine the right balance between encouraging the model to find errors and avoiding over-reliance on it. If you simply provide the context of the situation, as you clearly do, the model will naturally follow your instructions. You already have ‘weaknesses’ in the JSON format, so there’s no need for the last four bullet points in step 3. Honestly, your approach is 90% better than many that I’ve seen.\n\nPeople are out there literally telling the model to go into attack mode, and wondering why it's entertaining but so worthless.\n\nAlso, if you ever want to use your subscriptions instead of API keys only, this is a gem: [https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPIPlus](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPIPlus)",

Issues with reliability kept showing up during agent evaluation, and then some runs were failing in ways it felt hard to predict. Plus the latency and cost variation just became hard to justify or control, especially when the tasks looked similar on paper.\n\nSo first I focused on prompt design and ReAct loop structure. I changed how the agent was told to reason and the freedom it had during each execution step. Some changes made steps in the process look more coherent and it did lead to fewer obvious mistakes earlier on.\n\nBut when the tasks became wider the failure modes kept appearing. The agent was drifting or looping. Or sometimes it would commit to an early assumption inside the ReAct loop and just keep executing even when later actions were signalling that reassessment was necessary.\n\nSo I basically concluded that refining the loop only changed surface behavior and there were still deeper issues with reliability. \n\nInstead I shifted towards how execution decisions were handled over time at the orchestration layer. So because many agent systems lock their execution logic upfront and only evaluate outcomes after the run, you can’t intervene until afterwards, where the failure got baked in and you see wasted compute.\n\nIt made sense to intervene during execution instead of after the fact because then you can allocate TTC dynamically while the trajectories unfold. I basically felt like that had a much larger impact on the reliability. It shifted the question from why an agent failed to why the system was allowing an unproductive trajectory to continue unchecked for so long.",

Results are unusable, while OpenAI / OpenRouter large models work perfectly.\nIs this fundamentally a model size issue, or can sub-10B models realistically be made to work for structured insurance chat suggestions?\nLocal model preferred, due to sensitive PII.\n\n\n\nSo I’m working on an insurance AI project where the goal is to build a chat suggestion model for insurance agents.\nThe idea is that the model should assist agents during conversations with underwriters/customers, and its responses must follow some predefined enterprise formats (bind / reject / ask for documents / quote, etc.).\nBut we require an in-house hosted model (instead of 3rd party APIs) due to the senaitive nature of data we will be working with (contains PII, PHI) and to pass compliance tests later.\n\nI fine-tuned a LLaMA 1.3B model (from Huggingface) on a large internal dataset:\n- 5+ years of conversational insurance data\n- 500,000+ messages\n- Multi-turn conversations between agents and underwriters\n- Multiple insurance subdomains: car, home, fire safety, commercial vehicles, etc.\n- Includes flows for binding, rejecting, asking for more info, quoting, document collection\n- Data structure roughly like:\n{ case metadata + multi-turn agent/underwriter messages + final decision }\n- Training method: PEFT (LoRA)\n- Trained for more than 1 epoch, checkpointed after every epoch\n- Even after 5 epochs, results were extremely poor\n\nThe fine-tuned model couldn’t even generate coherent, contextual, complete sentences, let alone something usable for demo or production.\n\nTo sanity check, I also tested:\n- Out-of-the-box LLaMA 8B from Huggingface (no fine-tuning) - still not useful\n- OpenRouter API (default large model, I think 309B) - works good\n- OpenAI models - performs extremely well on the same tasks\n\nSo now I’m confused and would really appreciate some guidance.\n\nMy main questions:\n1. Is this purely a parameter scale issue?\nAm I just expecting too much from sub-10B models for structured enterprise chat suggestions?\n2. Is there realistically any way to make <10B models work for this use case?\n(With better formatting, instruction tuning, curriculum, synthetic data, continued pretraining, etc.)\n3. If small models are not suitable, what’s a practical lower bound?\n34B? 70B? 100B? 500B?\n4. Or am I likely doing something fundamentally wrong in data prep, training objective, or fine-tuning strategy?\n\nRight now, the gap between my fine-tuned 1.3B/8B models and large hosted models is massive, and I’m trying to understand whether this is an expected limitation or a fixable engineering problem.\n\nAny insights from people who’ve built domain-specific assistants or agent copilots would be hugely appreciated.",

      "text": "Hi everyone! I'm an at Mirascope, a small startup shipping open-source LLM infra. We just shipped v2 of our open-source Python library for typesafe LLM abstractions, and I'd like to share it.\n\n*TL;DR: This is a Python library with solid typing and cross-provider support for streaming, tools, structured outputs, and async, but without the overhead or assumptions of being a framework. Fully open-source and MIT licensed.*\n\nAlso, advance note: All em-dashes in this post were written by hand. It's option+shift+dash on a Macbook keyboard ;)\n\nIf you've felt like LangChain is too heavy and LiteLLM is too thin, Mirascope might be what you're looking for. It's not an \"agent framework\"—it's a set of abstractions so composable that you don't actually need one. Agents are just tool calling in a while loop.\n\nAnd it's got 100% test coverage, including cross-provider end-to-end tests for every features that use VCR to replay real provider responses in CI.\n\nThe pitch: How about a low-level API that's typesafe, Pythonic, cross-provider, exhaustively tested, and intentionally designed?  \n\n\nMirascope's focus is on typesafe, composable abstractions. The core concepts is you have an `llm.Model` that generates `llm.Response`s, and if you want to add tools, structured outputs, async, streaming, or MCP, everything just clicks together nicely. Here are some examples:\n\n    from mirascope import llm\n    \n    model: llm.Model = llm.Model(\"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5\")\n    response: llm.Response = model.call(\"Please recommend a fantasy book\")\n    print(response.text())\n    # > I'd recommend The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss...\n\nOr, if you want streaming, you can use `model.stream(...)`  along with `llm.StreamResponse`:\n\n    from mirascope import llm\n    \n    model: llm.Model = llm.Model(\"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5\")\n    response: llm.StreamResponse = model.stream(\"Do you think Pat Rothfuss will ever publish Doors of Stone?\")\n    \n    for chunk in response.text_stream():\n      print(chunk, flush=True, end=\"\")\n\nEach response has the full message history, which means you can continue generation by calling \\`response.resume\\`:\n\n    from mirascope import llm\n    \n    response = llm.Model(\"openai/gpt-5-mini\").call(\"How can I make a basil mint mojito?\")\n    print(response.text())\n    \n    response = response.resume(\"Is adding cucumber a good idea?\")\n    print(response.text())\n\n`Response.resume` is a cornerstone of the library, since it abstracts state tracking in a very predictable way. It also makes tool calling a breeze. You define tools via the `@llm.tool` decorator, and invoke them directly via the response.\n\n    from mirascope import llm\n    \n    @llm.tool\n    def exp(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n        \"\"\"Compute an exponent\"\"\"\n        return a ** b \n    \n    model = llm.Model(\"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5\")\n    response = model.call(\"What is (42 ** 3) ** 2?\", tools=[exp])\n    \n    while response.tool_calls:\n      print(f\"Calling tools: {response.tool_calls}\")\n      tool_outputs = response.execute_tools()\n      response = response.resume(tool_outputs)\n    \n    print(response.text())\n\nThe `llm.Response` class also allows handling structured outputs in a typesafe way, as it's generic on the structured output format. We support primitive types as well as Pydantic `BaseModel` out of the box:\n\n    from mirascope import llm \n    from pydantic import BaseModel\n    \n    class Book(BaseModel):\n        title: str\n        author: str\n        recommendation: str\n    \n    # nb. the @llm.call decorator is a convenient wrapper.\n    # Equivalent to model.call(f\"Recommend a {genre} book\", format=Book)\n    \n    @llm.call(\"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5\", format=Book)\n    def recommend_book(genre: str):\n      return f\"Recommend a {genre} book.\"\n    \n    response: llm.Response[Book] = recommend_book(\"fantasy\")\n    book: Book = response.parse()\n    print(book)\n    \n\nThe upshot is that if you want to do something sophisticated—like a streaming tool calling agent—you don't need a framework, you can just compose all these primitives.\n\n    from mirascope import llm\n    \n    @llm.tool\n    def exp(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n        \"\"\"Compute an exponent\"\"\"\n        return a ** b \n    \n    @llm.tool\n    def add(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n        \"\"\"Add two numbers\"\"\"\n        return a + b \n    \n    model = llm.Model(\"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5\")\n    response = model.stream(\"What is 42 ** 4 + 37 ** 3?\", tools=[exp, add])\n    \n    while True:\n        for chunk in response.pretty_stream():\n            print(chunk, flush=True, end=\"\")\n        if response.tool_calls:\n          tool_output = response.execute_tools()\n          response = response.resume(tool_output) \n        else:\n            break # Agent is finished\n\nI believe that if you give it a spin, it will delight you, whether you're coming from the direction of wanting more portability and convenience than using raw provider SDKs, or wanting more hands-on control than the big agent frameworks. These examples are all runnable, you can run`uv add \"mirascope[all]\"`, and set API keys.\n\nYou can read more in the [docs](https://mirascope.com/docs/learn/llm/quickstart), see the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mirascope/mirascope/tree/main), or join our [Discord](https://mirascope.com/discord-invite).

The difference is in philosophy of how you get there. Pydantic AI uses agents as the core primitive, whereas in Mirascope the primitives are one step \"more atomic\" at the level of LLM models, calls, and requests. Rather than providing a fixed agent as a primitive, we've just made it really easy to roll your own Agent.\n\nMirascope is one step \"closer to metal\" (ie. direct control over the LLM requests you're making, just with really nice APIs), whereas Pydantic gets convenience by going up one layer of abstraction.\n\nFor a lot of use cases both will serve well, but Mirascope takes more of an \"onion\" approach where it's easy to peel back a layer and get more direct control over LLM execution. The upshot is its easy to write Pydantic-style agents using Mirascope, but you also get flexibility over exactly what happens in a way that otherwise wouldn't exist.",

Optimizing and improving these parts atomically (one at a time) becomes crucial.",

Part of the composable abstractions advantage is that if you feel that it serves you better have a higher abstract for agents, just plugin another framework and work with both.

ACE is a framework that makes agents learn from their own execution feedback without fine-tuning.\n\nI've now built a specific application: agentic system prompting from agent traces.\n\nI kept noticing my agents making the same mistakes across runs. I fixed it by digging through traces, figure out what went wrong, patch the system prompt, repeat. It works, but it's tedious and didn't really scale.\n\nSo I built a way to automate this. You feed ACE your agent's historical execution traces, and it extracts actionable prompt improvements automatically.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **ReplayAgent** \\- Simulates agent behavior from recorded conversations (no live runs)\n2. **Reflector** \\- Analyzes what succeeded/failed, identifies patterns\n3. **SkillManager** \\- Transforms reflections into atomic, actionable strategies\n4. **Deduplicator** \\- Consolidates similar insights using embeddings\n5. **Skillbook** \\- Outputs human-readable recommendations with evidence\n\n**Each insight includes:**\n\n* Prompt suggestion - the actual text to add to your system prompt\n* Justification - why this change would help based on the analysis\n* Evidence - what actually happened in the trace that led to this insight\n\n**How this compares to DSPy/GEPA:**\n\nWhile DSPy works best with structured data (input/output pairs), ACE is designed to work directly on execution traces (logs, conversations, markdown files) and keeps humans in the loop for review. Compared to GEPA, the ACE paper was able to show significant improvements on benchmarks.\n\n**Try it yourself:** [https://github.com/kayba-ai/agentic-context-engine/tree/main/examples/agentic-system-prompting](https://github.com/kayba-ai/agentic-context-engine/tree/main/examples/agentic-system-prompting)\n\nWould love to hear your feedback if you do try it out",

You ask GPT-4 or Claude to solve a hard Sudoku or a scheduling problem, and while they sound confident, they often hallucinate a move that violates the rules because they are just predicting the next token probabilistically.  \n  \nI've been following the work on [Energy-Based Models](https://logicalintelligence.com/kona-ebms-energy-based-models), and specifically how they differ from autoregressive architectures.  \n  \nInstead of \"guessing\" the next step, the EBM architecture seems to solve this by minimizing an energy function over the whole board state.  \n  \nI found this benchmark pretty telling: [https://sudoku.logicalintelligence.com/](https://sudoku.logicalintelligence.com/)  \n  \nIt pits an EBM against standard LLMs. The difference in how they \"think\" is visible - the EBM doesn't generate text; it converges on a valid state that satisfies all constraints (rows, columns, boxes) simultaneously.  \n  \nFor devs building agents: This feels significant for anyone trying to build reliable agents for manufacturing, logistics, or code generation. If we can offload the \"logic checking\" to the model's architecture (inference time energy minimization) rather than writing endless Python guardrails, that’s a huge shift in our pipeline.  \n  \nHas anyone played with EBMs for production use cases yet? Curious about the compute cost vs standard inference.",

It's kind of insane rn.\n\n\n\nCurious who else has tried a similar approach yet?!",

      "text": "**Hey, I revised this post to clarify a few things and avoid confusion.**\n\nHi everyone. Not sure if this is the right place, but I’m posting here and in the ML subreddit for perspective.\n\n**Context**  \nI run a small AI and automation agency. Most of our work is building AI enabled systems, internal tools, and workflow automations. Our current stack is mainly Python and n8n, which has been more than enough for our typical clients.\n\nRecently, one of our clients referred us to a much larger enterprise organization. I’m under NDA so I can’t share the industry, but these are organizations and individuals operating at a 150M$ plus scale.\n\nThey want:\n\n* A private, offsite web application that functions as internal project and operations management software\n* A custom LLM powered system that is heavily tailored to a narrow and proprietary use case\n* Strong security, privacy, and access controls with everything kept private and controlled\n\nTo be clear upfront, we are not planning to build or train a foundation model from scratch. This would involve using existing models with fine tuning, retrieval, tooling, and system level design.\n\nThey also want us to take ownership of the technical direction of the project. This includes defining the architecture, selecting tooling and deployment models, and coordinating the right technical talent. We are also responsible for building the **core web application and frontend** that the LLM system will integrate into.\n\nThis is expected to be a multi year engagement. Early budget discussions are in the 500k to 2M plus range, with room to expand if it makes sense.\n\n**Our background**\n\n* I come from an IT and infrastructure background with USMC operational experience\n* We have experience operating in enterprise environments and leading projects at this scale, just not in this specific niche use case\n* Hardware, security constraints, and controlled environments are familiar territory\n* I have a strong backend and Python focused SWE co founder\n* We have worked alongside ML engineers before, just not in this exact type of deployment\n\nWhere I’m hoping to get perspective is mostly around **operational and architectural decisions**, not fundamentals.\n\n**What I’m hoping to get input on**\n\n1. **End to end planning at this scope** What roles and functions typically appear, common blind spots, and things people underestimate at this budget level\n2. **Private LLM strategy for niche enterprise use cases** Open source versus hosted versus hybrid approaches, and how people usually think about tradeoffs in highly controlled environments\n3. **Large internal data at the terabyte scale** How realistic this is for LLM workflows, what architectures work in practice, and what usually breaks first\n4. **GPU realities** Reasonable expectations for fine tuning versus inference Renting GPUs early versus longer term approaches When owning hardware actually makes sense, if ever\n\nThey have also asked us to help recruit and vet the right technical talent, which is another reason we want to set this up correctly from the start.\n\nIf you are an ML engineer based in South Florida, feel free to DM me. That said, I’m mainly here for advice and perspective rather than recruiting.\n\n**To preempt the obvious questions**\n\n* No, this is not a scam\n* They approached us through an existing client\n* Yes, this is a step up in terms of domain specificity, not project scale\n* We are not pretending to be experts at everything, which is why we are asking\n\nI’d rather get roasted here than make bad architectural decisions early.\n\nThanks in advance for any insight.  \n  \nEdit - P.S To clear up any confusion, we’re mainly building them a secure internal website with a frontend and backend to run their operations, and then layering a private LLM on top of that.\n\nThey basically didn’t want to spend months hiring people, talking to vendors, and figuring out who the fuck they actually needed, so they asked us to spearhead the whole thing instead. We own the architecture, find the right people, and drive the build from end to end.\n\nThat’s why from the outside it might look like, “how the fuck did these guys land an enterprise client that wants a private LLM,” when in reality the value is us taking full ownership of the technical and operational side, not just training a model.",

Docs in structured text files are very different than raw docs in PDFs or images.\n\nWithout understanding the project, I can only speak very generally:\n1. Requirements doc (including timeline) + budgeting comes first, which will determine hiring, architecture, hardware, milestones and schedule planning.\n2. Will depend on data security requirements, but the ideal case is to first try private hosted providers if the project allows it. You can stress test to find the actual demand curve and then make an educated guess on the hardware and its financial projections thereafter.\n3. At this scale I'm assuming offline batch doc processing. If self hosted, will need batch optimized inference servers like vllm, and it will be a trade off between speed, accuracy/intelligence, and $$$ but it can be doable. If hosted, then its a matter of negotiating with the provider.\n4. 4bit Qlora fine tune needs 2-4x more VRAM than small-cache inference, full fine tune needs 10-20x more VRAM. Yes you want to rent GPUs at first until you know your exact load and requirements, and if you end up determining that you can keep your own hardware GPUs under constant load then it will pay itself back in about 6 months.\n5. Architecture design roles as soon as possible, because the early planning stage can really make this 2x easier or 8x harder than it needs to be. And someone experienced in this field to accurately asses the hiring candidates, as its hard to tell who is competent vs just well practiced in interivews if you dont have the experience yourself.",

I'll be in the middle of a good conversation, then the AI mentions something technical or uses a term I don't fully understand.

But if I ask in the same conversation, now my main research chat has this tangent stuck in the middle of it, and the AI's context window gets filled with stuff that's not really relevant to my main question.\n\nI know some apps have \"fork\" features or conversation branching, but I haven't found anything that actually works well for this. Ideally I'd want to:\n\n•⁠  ⁠Highlight a specific part of the AI's response \n\n•⁠  ⁠Branch off into a separate mini-conversation just about that\n\n•⁠  ⁠Keep that exploration isolated so it doesn't pollute the main chat\n\n•⁠  ⁠Maybe save the key insight and attach it back to the original point\n\nDoes anything like this exist? Or am I just supposed to open 10 different chat windows and copy-paste context around like a caveman?\n\nWould genuinely appreciate any suggestions. This is driving me nuts.",

AGI soon, agents replacing workers, autonomous everything.\n\nHere are actual predictions based on what I saw working and failing.\n\nFramework consolidation happens fast. Langchain, CrewAI, Autogen cant all survive. One or two become standard, rest become niche or die. Already seeing teams move toward simpler options or visual tools like Vellum.\n\nThe \"agent wrapper\" startups mostly fail. Lot of companies are thin wrappers around LLM APIs with agent branding. When big providers add native agent features these become irrelevant. Only ones with real differentiation survive.\n\nReliability becomes the battleground. Demos that work 80% impressed people before. In 2026 that wont cut it. Whoever solves consistent production reliability wins.\n\nEnterprise adoption stays slower than predicted. Most big companies still in pilot mode. Security concerns, integration complexity, unclear ROI. Doesnt change dramatically in one year.\n\nPersonal agents become more common than work agents. Lower stakes, easier to experiment, no approval needed. People automate personal workflows before companies figure out how to do it safely.\n\nNo AGI, no robots taking over. Just incremental progress on making this stuff work.\n\nWhat are your non hype predictions?",
