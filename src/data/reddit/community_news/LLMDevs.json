The cleaning, chunking, and optimization challenges are exactly what excites me.\n\nWhat I built:\n\n\\- Full RAG pipeline with optimized data processing\n\n\\- Processed 2M+ pages (cleaning, chunking, vectorization)\n\n\\- Semantic search & Q&A over massive dataset\n\n\\- Constantly tweaking for better retrieval & performance\n\n\\- Python, MIT Licensed, open source\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nIt’s trending, real-world data at scale, the perfect playground.\n\nWhen you operate at scale, every optimization matters. This project lets me experiment with RAG architectures, data pipelines, and AI performance tuning on real-world workloads.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG](https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG)\n\nOpen to ideas, optimizations, and technical discussions!",

The focus is a pure NVFP4 fast path: FP8 KV cache, custom FP8 decode kernel, no silent FP16 fallback. It currently targets Qwen3 (dense + MoE) and Gemma3 (including sliding-window layers), I'll be adding support to other models soon.\n\n>**Please think of giving the Github repo a STAR if you like it :)**\n\n# Why this is interesting\n\n* NVFP4-first runtime for Ada GPUs (tested on RTX 4090) with FP8 KV cache end-to-end.\n* Custom Triton FP8 decode kernel; prefill uses FlashAttention (varlen).\n* No FP16 fallback for decode. If FP8 kernel fails, it errors out instead of silently switching.\n* Tensor-parallel (NCCL) + CUDA graphs for decode (also support eager mode)\n\n# Benchmarks (RTX 4090)\n\n**Qwen3-8B-NVFP4**\n\n|batch|total tokens|seconds|tok/s|peak GB|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|128|3.3867|37.79|7.55|\n|2|256|3.5471|72.17|7.55|\n|4|512|3.4392|148.87|7.55|\n|8|1024|3.4459|297.16|7.56|\n|16|2048|4.3636|469.34|7.56|\n\n**Gemma3-27B-it-NVFP4**\n\n|batch|total tokens|seconds|tok/s|peak GB|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|128|9.3982|13.62|19.83|\n|2|256|9.5545|26.79|19.83|\n|4|512|9.5344|53.70|19.84|\n\nfor Qwen3-8B-NVFP4 I observed \\~2.4x lower peak VRAM vs Qwen3-8B FP16 baselines (with \\~20-25% throughput loss).\n\n# Quickstart\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/BenChaliah/NVFP4-on-4090-vLLM.git\n    \n    adallm serve nvidia/Qwen3-8B-NVFP4\n\n>\\`export NVFP4\\_FP8=1\\` is optional and enables FP8 GEMM path (NVFP4\\_FP8=0: the difference is in compute precision not VRAM, FP8 KV cache + the FP8 decode kernel are still used.\n\n**Supported models (so far)**\n\n* `nvidia/Qwen3-8B-NVFP4`\n* `BenChaliah/Gemma3-27B-it-NVFP4`\n* Qwen3 MoE variants are supported, but still slow (see README for MoE notes).\n\n**Limitations**\n\n* MoE routing and offload paths are not fully optimized yet (working on it currently)\n* Only NVFP4 weights, no FP16 fallback for decode by design.\n* Targeted at Ada Lovelace (sm\\_89).

      "text": "Hi r/LLMDevs,\n\nStjepan from Manning here. The mods said it's ok if I post this here. \n\nWe’ve just released a book that’s very much aimed at the kinds of problems this community discusses all the time: what to do when a general-purpose LLM is technically impressive but awkward, expensive, or inefficient for your actual use case.\n\n**Rearchitecting LLMs** by Pere Martra  \n[https://www.manning.com/books/rearchitecting-llms](https://hubs.la/Q042-hLy0)\n\n[Rearchitecting LLMs by Pere Martra](https://preview.redd.it/vyy079zx78jg1.jpg?width=2213&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=755a8b1ab1320ede5daedfa861d6ab8d1b0c5e5d)\n\nThe core idea of the book is simple but powerful: instead of treating open models as fixed artifacts, you can reshape them. Pere walks through structural techniques like targeted fine-tuning, pruning, and knowledge distillation to build smaller, cheaper, domain-focused models that still perform well on the tasks you care about.\n\nWhat makes this book interesting is how hands-on it gets. You’re not working with abstract toy networks. The examples focus on modifying widely used open models, such as Llama-3, Gemma, and Qwen. The focus is on understanding which parts of a model actually contribute to behavior, how to identify waste or redundancy, and how to remove or compress components without blindly wrecking performance.\n\nThere’s also some genuinely thoughtful material on combining behavioral analysis with structural changes. Instead of just cutting parameters and hoping for the best, the book explores ways to reason about why a modification works or fails. One section that tends to spark discussion is “fair pruning,” where pruning is used not only for efficiency but also to reduce bias at the neuron level.\n\nIf you’re working on local models, cost-constrained deployments, or specialized SLMs, this book is very much in that territory. It’s written for people who are comfortable with LLM concepts and want to go deeper into how models can be reshaped rather than simply prompted.\n\n**For the** r/LLMDevs **community:**  \nYou can get **50% off** with the code **MLMARTRA50RE**.\n\nA quick note on availability: the book is currently in **MEAP (Manning Early Access Program)**. That means you get immediate access to the chapters as they’re written, along with updates as the manuscript evolves.\n\nHappy to bring the author to answer questions about the book, the techniques it covers, or the kinds of readers it’s best suited for. And I’d be curious to hear from folks here who are already doing pruning or distillation in practice — what’s been harder than expected?\n\nI'm ready to give away 5 ebooks to the first five commenters who share their experience here.\n\nThank you all for having us. It feels great to be here.\n\nCheers,",

Was always thinking Id need a larger model to handle such a task because it sounds easy enough, but capturing the essence of one's writing is quite a complex task for llms.

              "text": "Hi u/StackSmashRepeat \n\nI'll give you a rough explanation and if you want more details just ask me. \n\nIn the book I explain an LLM optimization / customization pipeline. The pipeline basically consists of: \n\n1- Pruning (depth and width) which is removing parts of a model. \n\n2- Knowledge Distillation. Recovering the lost knowledge by transferring it from the base model to the pruned one. \n\n3- Finetuning on a specialized domain. \n\nDuring this pipeline you gain knowledge about how models work internally, since to decide which parts to remove we study how activations are produced detecting the mos important parts. \n\nWe take advantage of this knowledge to do surgical operations on the model in the more advanced chapters, like replacing attention layers or changing the behaviour of the model modifying the weights of some neurons. \n\nThe pipeline is very similar to what companies like Nvidia or Mistral follow to create their model families, but adapted to create specific models,  and using less data and processing capacity than they have.   \n  \nFor example in width pruning Mistral uses a completely dynamic model to detect which weights to remove, in the book we use a combination that rewards keeping neurons with high importance, so with much less data you can get an efficient model. \n\nAlthough it really seems very complicated we start from the simplest things, basic depth pruning, in chapter 2 you already remove parts of a model and recover the lost knowledge. \n\nFrom this base you build the knowledge that leads you to the more advanced techniques. \n\nThen there's a second intention which is to make cutting-edge research understandable, so in each chapter starting from the fourth, there's an explanation of which papers the chapter's code is based on and how we've adapted it when implementing it. \n\nFor example the development of width pruning in modern models like Llama or Gemma is based on a paper which we've changed a good part of the formulas to simplify it but keeping its general idea. \n\nI hope the explanation was useful! \n\nPere.",

This way, the schema between agents will always be predictable, and agents can still effectively coordinate and chat among eachother.

Like if a site has completely different component structure at mobile vs desktop, does it capture both states or does Playwright just grab whatever viewport you set?  \nAlso the diffing feature is interesting. I wonder if that could be useful for tracking how design systems evolve over time, like crawling the same site every few months and seeing what changed.

      "text": "Been digging into the LLaDA2.1 paper (arXiv:2602.08676) after seeing claims about diffusion LLMs hitting 892 TPS on HumanEval+. The numbers are interesting enough that I'm starting to wonder if we've been sleeping on diffusion models for inference workloads.\n\nQuick context for those unfamiliar: LLaDA2.1 introduces a dual decoding system (Speedy Mode vs Quality Mode) that lets you trade accuracy for throughput. The 100B model hits 892 TPS peak on coding benchmarks with quantization, while the 16B model averages 1071 TPS across nine benchmarks vs 302 TPS for Qwen3 8B. The key innovation is Token to Token editing that lets the model correct its own mistakes during generation.\n\nStandard absorbing state diffusion models have a fundamental problem: once a \\[MASK\\] token becomes a real token, it's locked in forever. LLaDA2.1 adds what they call an \"Editing Set\" alongside the \"Unmasking Set\" at each timestep. This means the model can retroactively fix errors during parallel decoding, which addresses the token inconsistency issues that have plagued diffusion LLMs. Speedy Mode generates a rough draft fast (aggressive M2T threshold), then T2T passes clean up the artifacts. Quality Mode uses conservative thresholds throughout for higher accuracy but slower generation.\n\nThe benchmark highlights: LLaDA2.1 Flash (100B) on HumanEval+ scores 89.63 in both modes, with Speedy Mode achieving 13.81 tokens per forward vs Quality Mode's 9.18 TPF. On LiveCodeBench, Speedy Mode hits 44.05 at 6.48 TPF while Quality Mode reaches 45.37 at 3.80 TPF. Peak throughput with their quantized setup: 891.74 TPS on HumanEval+, 801.48 TPS on BigCodeBench Full, 663.39 TPS on LiveCodeBench. The 16B Mini variant peaks at 1586.93 TPS on HumanEval+. Compared to baselines across nine benchmarks: LLaDA2.1 Mini averages 1071.2 TPS vs 597.1 for LLaDA2.0 Mini, 464.7 for Ling Mini 2.0, and 301.9 for Qwen3 8B. That's roughly 3.55x throughput comparing the 16B diffusion model against the 8B autoregressive baseline, so not exactly apples to apples on parameters, but the efficiency gap is notable. Reproducibility note: these numbers use customized SGLang with per block FP8 quantization.\n\nThey also have Multi Block Editing that trades throughput for accuracy: AIME 2025 jumps from 63.33 to 70.00 with MBE, ZebraLogic from 84.20 to 88.20. Average across 10 benchmarks: 72.67 at 5.14 TPF with MBE vs 70.69 at 5.82 TPF without.\n\nOn the training side, they built what they claim is the first large scale RL framework for diffusion LLMs using EBPO (ELBO based Block level Policy Optimization). The core problem is that sequence level log likelihood is intractable in block autoregressive models, so they use Vectorized Likelihood Estimation for parallelized bound computation. Interesting direction if you're thinking about fine tuning diffusion models beyond standard SFT, though I haven't dug deep into the training methodology yet.\n\nNow here's where I'm genuinely uncertain. The paper is upfront about the tradeoffs: Speedy Mode works well for code and math but can produce artifacts on general chat. They specifically mention n gram repetitions that self correction only partially fixes. So the question becomes: are these throughput numbers meaningful if you can only use Speedy Mode for narrow domains?\n\nTo make this concrete: say you're running a code completion service handling 10K requests per minute. At 302 TPS with Qwen3 8B, you need roughly 33 inference instances to keep up. At 1071 TPS with LLaDA2.1 Mini, that drops to about 10 instances. That's real infrastructure savings if the quality holds up in production. But I'm skeptical whether benchmark TPS translates to real world throughput given the different decoding dynamics, and whether the occasional n gram artifacts would tank user experience.\n\nPaper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08676](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08676)\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/inclusionAI/LLaDA2.X](https://github.com/inclusionAI/LLaDA2.X)\n\nFor those running inference at scale: would 3x throughput on code generation be enough to justify adding a completely different model architecture to your stack? Or is the operational complexity not worth it until diffusion models close the gap on general tasks?",

      "text": "Hey! I was recently hired to build an AI shopping assistant for a huge brand, 1B$+ in revenue. Unfortunately can't say which one is it (damn NDAs), but I thought I'd share some lessons. After the project CTO told me “Working with you was the best AI investment in the last year”, so I guess it went well!\n\nI'm reposting this from my linkedin, so sorry for this \"linkedinish\" vibe:\n\nThe biggest secret was, surprise, surprise, **not** wasn’t fancy AI methods, complex RAG pipelines, and multi step workflows. In the end it was good prompts, a bunch of domain-specific tools and one subagent.  \n  \nThe secret was the process.  \n  \nI didn’t know anything about skincare so I had to learn about it. Even light understanding of the domain turned out EXTREMELY IMPORTANT since it allowed m to play around with an agent and have a good judgement whether it says good things. The fastest feedback loop is always \"in your head\".   \n  \nI built a domain-specific dashboard for the client. A collaborative environment where domain experts can play around with an agent, comment, feedback, etc. I took the idea from [Hamel Husain](https://x.com/HamelHusain) who said that [“The Most Important AI Investment is A Simple Data Viewer”.](https://x.com/i/status/1991903412997509372) He was damn right about it.   \n  \nThe last thing is something that is not talked much about but it should. We got hundreds of files about company knowledge. This knowledge is spread around big organisations like crazy. But if you really really understand the domain, if you really digest it all and ask a lot of questions, you’ll be able to COMPRESS this knowledge. You’ll find common stuff, remove dead ends, and really narrow it down to sth that expresses most about this company in smallest piece of text. This is your system prompt!! Why split context and add a potential point of failure if you can have MOST of the important stuff always in the system prompt? It’s crazy how well it works.  \n  \nOn the context engineering side we ended up with a great system prompt + a bunch of tools for getting info about products. I added one subagent for more complex stuff (routine building), but that was the only “fancy” thing out there.  \n  \nI think the lesson here is that building agents is not hard on the technical level, and every developer can do it! The models do all the heavy lifting and they’re only getting better. The secret is understanding the domain and extracting the domain knowledge from people who know it. It's communication.\n\n  \nI'm curious:\n\nHave you built such \"customer support\"-related agents for your companies too? One thing that triggers me is amount of those giant SaaS companies that promises \"the super ultra duper ai agent\", and honestly? I think they don't have much secret sauce. Models are doing heavy lifting, and simple methods where heavy lifting is done by domain-specific knowledge trump general purpose ones. \n\nHere's what Malte from Vercel recently wrote btw:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h2pjrjfix1jg1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8cd25ac93ee3a1b92cab153a1c591edbaf35d78\n\nIt somehow clicks.",

(Did they come asking for it, or did you identify the use case?)\n* What was the scope? (customer support, internal knowledge base, document search, etc.)\n\n**Delivery & Timeline:**\n\n* How long did the project take from discovery to delivery?\n* What were the biggest technical challenges you faced?\n* Did you handle ongoing maintenance, or was it a one-time delivery?\n\n**Business Side:**\n\n* How did you find these clients? (freelance platforms, LinkedIn outreach, referrals, content marketing, etc.)\n* What did you charge? (ballpark is fine, just trying to understand market rates)\n* How did you structure pricing? (fixed project, hourly, monthly retainer?)\n\n**Post-Delivery:**\n\n* Were clients happy with the results?\n* Did you iterate/improve the system after launch?\n* Any lessons learned that you'd do differently next time?\n\nThanks !",

I’d really appreciate your thoughts on a challenge I’m currently facing and whether you would approach it differently.\n\nUse-Case\n\nI’m building an **intent classifier** that must:\n\n* Run **on edge**\n* Stay around **\\~100ms latency**\n* Predict **1 out of 9 intent labels**\n* Consider **up to 2 previous conversation turns**\n\nThe environment is domain-specific (medical domain in reality), but to simplify, imagine a system controlling a car.\n\nExample:  \nYou have an intent like `lane_change`, and the user can request it in many different ways.\n\nCurrent Setup\n\n* Base model: **phi-3.5-mini-instruct**\n* Fine-tuned using **LoRA**\n* Model explicitly outputs only the intent token (e.g., `command_xyz`)\n* Each intent is mapped to a **single special token**\n* Almost no system prompt (removed to save tokens)\n\nPerformance:\n\n* \\~110ms latency (non-quantized) → acceptable\n* \\~10 input tokens on average\n* \\~5 output tokens on average\n* 25k training samples\n* \\~95% accuracy\n\nSpeed is not the main issue — I still have some room for token optimization and quantization if needed.\n\nthe real challenge -> the missing 5%.\n\nThe issue is **edge cases**.\n\nThe model operates in an open-input environment. The user can phrase requests in unlimited ways.\n\nFor example:  \nFor `lane_change`, there might be 30+ semantically equivalent variations. I built a synthetic data generation pipeline to create such variations and spent \\~2 weeks refining it. Evaluation suggests it's decent.\n\nBut:\n\nThere are still rare phrasings that the model hasn’t seen → wrong intent prediction.\n\nOf course, I can:\n\n* Iteratively collect misclassifications\n* Add them to the training set\n* Retrain\n\nBut that’s slow and reactive.\n\nConstraints:\n\n* I could use a larger model (e.g., phi-4), and I’ve tested it.\n* However, time-to-first-token for phi-4 is significantly slower.\n* Latency is more important than squeezing out a few extra percent of quality.\n\nSo scaling up model size isn’t ideal.\n\nMy questions to you:\n\nHow would you tackle the final 5%?\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing how others would approach this kind of edge, low-latency intent classification problem.\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "(xpost from r/python)  \n  \nI extended pandas filtering to handle qualitative criteria you can't put in a `.query()` and screened 3600 job posts for remote friendly, senior roles with salaries disclosed**.**\n\nI built [everyrow.io/screen](http://everyrow.io/screen) ([docs](https://everyrow.io/docs/reference/SCREEN)), a Python SDK that adds qualitative operations to pandas DataFrames. The API pattern is: describe your criteria, pass in a DataFrame, get a DataFrame back, with all the LLM orchestration handled for you.\n\nHere's an example, filtering 3600 HN job posts for senior, remote-friendly, roles where the salaries are disclosed:\n\n    import asyncio\n    import pandas as pd\n    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n    from everyrow.ops import screen\n    \n    jobs = pd.read_csv(\"hn_jobs.csv\")  # 3,616 job postings\n    \n    class JobScreenResult(BaseModel):\n        qualifies: bool = Field(description=\"True if meets ALL criteria\")\n    \n    async def main():\n        result = await screen(\n            task=\"\"\"\n            A job posting qualifies if it meets ALL THREE criteria:\n    \n            1. Remote-friendly: Explicitly allows remote work, hybrid, WFH,\n               distributed teams, or \"work from anywhere\".\n    \n            2. Senior-level: Title contains Senior/Staff/Lead/Principal/Architect,\n               OR requires 5+ years experience, OR mentions \"founding engineer\".\n    \n            3. Salary disclosed: Specific compensation numbers are mentioned.\n               \"$150K-200K\" qualifies. \"Competitive\" or \"DOE\" does not.\n            \"\"\",\n            input=jobs,\n            response_model=JobScreenResult,\n        )\n    \n        qualified = result.data\n        print(f\"Qualified: {len(qualified)} of {len(jobs)}\")\n        return qualified\n    \n    qualified_jobs = asyncio.run(main())\n\nInterestingly, in early 2020, only 1.7% of job postings met all three criteria. By 2025, that number reached 14.5%.  \n  \nWithout using LLMs, the best you can do on this task is to keyword filter, e.g. for \"remote\", but this has a bunch of false positives for things like \"not remote!\"\n\nThe closest alternatives that use LLMs are probably LangChain-style chains where you write your own prompt and orchestrate the LLMs. But this example uses 3600 LLM calls (and everyrow supports web research agents), so this can get complex and expensive quickly.\n\n**Source code**: [github.com/futuresearch/everyrow-sdk](https://github.com/futuresearch/everyrow-sdk) \\- MIT licensed, Python 3.12+",
