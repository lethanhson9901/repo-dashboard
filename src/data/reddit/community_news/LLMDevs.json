      "text": "I just finished reading *Agentic Design Patterns: A Hands-On Guide to Building Intelligent Systems*, and wanted to share some thoughts from an LLM dev perspective.\n\nThe author, Antonio Gulli (Google Cloud AI), clearly writes from an engineering background. This isn’t a trends or hype book — it’s very focused on how to actually structure agentic systems that go beyond single-call prompting.\n\nWhat the book focuses on\n\nInstead of models or benchmarks, the book frames agent development around **design patterns**, similar to classic software engineering.\n\nIt addresses a question many of us run into:\n\nHow do you turn LLM calls into reliable, multi-step, long-running systems?\n\nThe book is organized around \\~20 agentic patterns, including:\n\n* Prompt chaining, routing, and planning\n* Tool use and context engineering\n* Memory, RAG, and adaptation\n* Multi-agent coordination and communication\n* Guardrails, evaluation, and failure recovery\n\nMost chapters include concrete code examples (LangChain / LangGraph / CrewAI / Google tooling), not just conceptual diagrams.\n\nWhat I found useful as a dev\n\nPersonally, the biggest value was:\n\n* A clearer **mental model for agent workflows**, not just “agent = loop”\n* Better intuition for when to decompose into multiple agents vs a single one\n* Practical framing of context engineering and memory management\n* Realistic discussion of limitations (reasoning, evaluation, safety)\n\nIt helped me reason more systematically about why many agent demos break down when you try to scale or productize them.\n\nWho this is probably for\n\n* LLM devs building agentic workflows or internal tools\n* People moving from single-call pipelines to multi-step systems\n* Engineers thinking about production reliability, not just demos\n\nIf you’re mostly interested in model internals or training, this may not be your thing. If you’re focused on **system design around LLMs**, it’s worth a look.\n\nIf anyone here has read it, I’d be curious to hear your take.",

This means the real constraint isn't compute power anymore. It's memory bandwidth.\n\nThat's not how it works. Memory bandwidth has nothing to do with the entire model size, because you are not processing the whole MoE model. You need to load the whole model in RAM, so what matters is the quantity of RAM. Then you can estimate token generation speed dividing memory bandwidth by active parameters.\n\nThat said, AMD loves to advertise false memory bandwidths for its CPUs. You can only saturate the theoretical bandwidth if CPU-bus bandwidth is at least the same. If not, that's a bottleneck. Only higher count (and higher cost) Epyc CPUs have enough chiplets and links to saturate the bandwidth. Sadly, you need an 8+ chiplets SKU, which coupled with 12 sticks of fast RAM is going to cost more than 5k.\n\nOnce you have selected the right CPU and RAM, you have a high bandwidth system. Which is very good at token generation, no doubt about that, but very slow at prompt processing where only FLOPS matter.",

On a CPU, you don't hit the bandwidth ceiling.. you hit the compute ceiling first. You're not solving the problem, you're just trading a bandwidth bottleneck for a worse compute bottleneck.\n\nTheir whole argument is based on batch size = 1, which is not how production LLMs run. The moment you're batching requests, compute dominates again. LLMs are massively parallelized matrix multiplication.. you can't compare a GPU with thousands of cores to an EPYC with 128.\n\nAnd then there's efficiency. We measure hardware on FLOPs per watt. Yeah, a 5090 will suck every electron out of your socket, but it's nowhere near as much of a pig as a 128-core system burning more watts *per token*.\n\nNo offense intended, but this reads like a senior software engineer writing about ML infrastructure without the background. There's a lot of research that's explored the \"should we just CPU it\" angle and they all pretty much land on: technically doable, massively wasteful.",

Instead, simply tag them as Model A, B, C, etc.\n* More importantly, tone down your step 3 prompt a bit, especially on the “find errors” part. All the counsel, quorum, debate, and peer-review workflows can have a significant impact on the quality of the output, both positively and negatively. The crucial point is to determine the right balance between encouraging the model to find errors and avoiding over-reliance on it. If you simply provide the context of the situation, as you clearly do, the model will naturally follow your instructions. You already have ‘weaknesses’ in the JSON format, so there’s no need for the last four bullet points in step 3. Honestly, your approach is 90% better than many that I’ve seen.\n\nPeople are out there literally telling the model to go into attack mode, and wondering why it's entertaining but so worthless.\n\nAlso, if you ever want to use your subscriptions instead of API keys only, this is a gem: [https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPIPlus](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPIPlus)",

Issues with reliability kept showing up during agent evaluation, and then some runs were failing in ways it felt hard to predict. Plus the latency and cost variation just became hard to justify or control, especially when the tasks looked similar on paper.\n\nSo first I focused on prompt design and ReAct loop structure. I changed how the agent was told to reason and the freedom it had during each execution step. Some changes made steps in the process look more coherent and it did lead to fewer obvious mistakes earlier on.\n\nBut when the tasks became wider the failure modes kept appearing. The agent was drifting or looping. Or sometimes it would commit to an early assumption inside the ReAct loop and just keep executing even when later actions were signalling that reassessment was necessary.\n\nSo I basically concluded that refining the loop only changed surface behavior and there were still deeper issues with reliability. \n\nInstead I shifted towards how execution decisions were handled over time at the orchestration layer. So because many agent systems lock their execution logic upfront and only evaluate outcomes after the run, you can’t intervene until afterwards, where the failure got baked in and you see wasted compute.\n\nIt made sense to intervene during execution instead of after the fact because then you can allocate TTC dynamically while the trajectories unfold. I basically felt like that had a much larger impact on the reliability. It shifted the question from why an agent failed to why the system was allowing an unproductive trajectory to continue unchecked for so long.",

      "text": "Hi everyone! I'm an at Mirascope, a small startup shipping open-source LLM infra. We just shipped v2 of our open-source Python library for typesafe LLM abstractions, and I'd like to share it.\n\n*TL;DR: This is a Python library with solid typing and cross-provider support for streaming, tools, structured outputs, and async, but without the overhead or assumptions of being a framework. Fully open-source and MIT licensed.*\n\nAlso, advance note: All em-dashes in this post were written by hand. It's option+shift+dash on a Macbook keyboard ;)\n\nIf you've felt like LangChain is too heavy and LiteLLM is too thin, Mirascope might be what you're looking for. It's not an \"agent framework\"—it's a set of abstractions so composable that you don't actually need one. Agents are just tool calling in a while loop.\n\nAnd it's got 100% test coverage, including cross-provider end-to-end tests for every features that use VCR to replay real provider responses in CI.\n\nThe pitch: How about a low-level API that's typesafe, Pythonic, cross-provider, exhaustively tested, and intentionally designed?  \n\n\nMirascope's focus is on typesafe, composable abstractions. The core concepts is you have an `llm.Model` that generates `llm.Response`s, and if you want to add tools, structured outputs, async, streaming, or MCP, everything just clicks together nicely. Here are some examples:\n\n    from mirascope import llm\n    \n    model: llm.Model = llm.Model(\"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5\")\n    response: llm.Response = model.call(\"Please recommend a fantasy book\")\n    print(response.text())\n    # > I'd recommend The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss...\n\nOr, if you want streaming, you can use `model.stream(...)`  along with `llm.StreamResponse`:\n\n    from mirascope import llm\n    \n    model: llm.Model = llm.Model(\"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5\")\n    response: llm.StreamResponse = model.stream(\"Do you think Pat Rothfuss will ever publish Doors of Stone?\")\n    \n    for chunk in response.text_stream():\n      print(chunk, flush=True, end=\"\")\n\nEach response has the full message history, which means you can continue generation by calling \\`response.resume\\`:\n\n    from mirascope import llm\n    \n    response = llm.Model(\"openai/gpt-5-mini\").call(\"How can I make a basil mint mojito?\")\n    print(response.text())\n    \n    response = response.resume(\"Is adding cucumber a good idea?\")\n    print(response.text())\n\n`Response.resume` is a cornerstone of the library, since it abstracts state tracking in a very predictable way. It also makes tool calling a breeze. You define tools via the `@llm.tool` decorator, and invoke them directly via the response.\n\n    from mirascope import llm\n    \n    @llm.tool\n    def exp(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n        \"\"\"Compute an exponent\"\"\"\n        return a ** b \n    \n    model = llm.Model(\"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5\")\n    response = model.call(\"What is (42 ** 3) ** 2?\", tools=[exp])\n    \n    while response.tool_calls:\n      print(f\"Calling tools: {response.tool_calls}\")\n      tool_outputs = response.execute_tools()\n      response = response.resume(tool_outputs)\n    \n    print(response.text())\n\nThe `llm.Response` class also allows handling structured outputs in a typesafe way, as it's generic on the structured output format. We support primitive types as well as Pydantic `BaseModel` out of the box:\n\n    from mirascope import llm \n    from pydantic import BaseModel\n    \n    class Book(BaseModel):\n        title: str\n        author: str\n        recommendation: str\n    \n    # nb. the @llm.call decorator is a convenient wrapper.\n    # Equivalent to model.call(f\"Recommend a {genre} book\", format=Book)\n    \n    @llm.call(\"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5\", format=Book)\n    def recommend_book(genre: str):\n      return f\"Recommend a {genre} book.\"\n    \n    response: llm.Response[Book] = recommend_book(\"fantasy\")\n    book: Book = response.parse()\n    print(book)\n    \n\nThe upshot is that if you want to do something sophisticated—like a streaming tool calling agent—you don't need a framework, you can just compose all these primitives.\n\n    from mirascope import llm\n    \n    @llm.tool\n    def exp(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n        \"\"\"Compute an exponent\"\"\"\n        return a ** b \n    \n    @llm.tool\n    def add(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n        \"\"\"Add two numbers\"\"\"\n        return a + b \n    \n    model = llm.Model(\"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5\")\n    response = model.stream(\"What is 42 ** 4 + 37 ** 3?\", tools=[exp, add])\n    \n    while True:\n        for chunk in response.pretty_stream():\n            print(chunk, flush=True, end=\"\")\n        if response.tool_calls:\n          tool_output = response.execute_tools()\n          response = response.resume(tool_output) \n        else:\n            break # Agent is finished\n\nI believe that if you give it a spin, it will delight you, whether you're coming from the direction of wanting more portability and convenience than using raw provider SDKs, or wanting more hands-on control than the big agent frameworks. These examples are all runnable, you can run`uv add \"mirascope[all]\"`, and set API keys.\n\nYou can read more in the [docs](https://mirascope.com/docs/learn/llm/quickstart), see the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mirascope/mirascope/tree/main), or join our [Discord](https://mirascope.com/discord-invite).

The difference is in philosophy of how you get there. Pydantic AI uses agents as the core primitive, whereas in Mirascope the primitives are one step \"more atomic\" at the level of LLM models, calls, and requests. Rather than providing a fixed agent as a primitive, we've just made it really easy to roll your own Agent.\n\nMirascope is one step \"closer to metal\" (ie. direct control over the LLM requests you're making, just with really nice APIs), whereas Pydantic gets convenience by going up one layer of abstraction.\n\nFor a lot of use cases both will serve well, but Mirascope takes more of an \"onion\" approach where it's easy to peel back a layer and get more direct control over LLM execution. The upshot is its easy to write Pydantic-style agents using Mirascope, but you also get flexibility over exactly what happens in a way that otherwise wouldn't exist.",

If we can offload the \"logic checking\" to the model's architecture (inference time energy minimization) rather than writing endless Python guardrails, that’s a huge shift in our pipeline.  \n  \nHas anyone played with EBMs for production use cases yet?

Langchain, CrewAI, Autogen cant all survive. One or two become standard, rest become niche or die. Already seeing teams move toward simpler options or visual tools like Vellum.\n\nThe \"agent wrapper\" startups mostly fail. Lot of companies are thin wrappers around LLM APIs with agent branding. When big providers add native agent features these become irrelevant. Only ones with real differentiation survive.\n\nReliability becomes the battleground. Demos that work 80% impressed people before. In 2026 that wont cut it. Whoever solves consistent production reliability wins.\n\nEnterprise adoption stays slower than predicted. Most big companies still in pilot mode. Security concerns, integration complexity, unclear ROI. Doesnt change dramatically in one year.\n\nPersonal agents become more common than work agents. Lower stakes, easier to experiment, no approval needed. People automate personal workflows before companies figure out how to do it safely.\n\nNo AGI, no robots taking over. Just incremental progress on making this stuff work.\n\nWhat are your non hype predictions?",

Instead, you should map out what business processes should be automated with AI agents and build PoCs around them.

          "text": "I think you are looking at two complementary parts of the same workflow, not two competing paradigms.\n\nFrameworks like DeepEval and LLM-as-judge are mainly an automation layer. They help you run the same checks repeatedly, compare variants, and catch regressions. Hamel’s approach is more about deciding what those checks should be in the first place, based on how your system actually fails in practice. In other words, error analysis is how you discover the evaluation targets, and the frameworks are how you operationalize them.\n\nIn pre-production, a reasonable sequence is:\n\n1. Collect a set of traces that reflect realistic inputs and full system behavior, including intermediate tool calls and the final output.\n2. Manually review a small but diverse sample and build a failure taxonomy. Then slice by meaningful dimensions (question type, schema complexity, ambiguity, long context, edge cases, user intent).\n3. Convert the most frequent and most costly failures into automated evaluators. Use deterministic checks where possible, and reserve LLM judges for genuinely subjective cases.\n4. Maintain a regression set that represents the failure modes you already fixed. Run it on every prompt/model change.\n5. Periodically repeat the manual review step, especially after significant changes, because new failure modes will appear.\n\nThat also answers your last question: you do not need to manually inspect outputs every time you change a prompt or model. You manually inspect to discover failure modes and to validate new evaluators. Most iteration should be automated once you have a suite, with targeted human review on deltas, new slices, and occasional refresh cycles.\n\nFor text-to-SQL specifically, you can often reduce reliance on judges by leaning on objective checks:\n\n* Parse and validate the SQL, and enforce schema and policy constraints (allowed tables, required filters, no unsafe operations).\n* Execute against a test or staging database when possible, and score based on result equivalence rather than exact string match.\n* Track performance constraints (timeouts, cost, large scans) as first-class failure modes, because correctness is not the only axis that matters in production.\n\nIf you do use LLM-as-judge, I would treat it like a measurement tool that needs calibration. Keep prompts tightly scoped, prefer pass/fail decisions over 1–5 scales, and periodically audit judge agreement against a small human-labeled set. If you see instability, add ordering randomization for pairwise comparisons and consider using a judge from a different model family than the candidate you are evaluating.\n\nAs for resources that connect these perspectives, the Pragmatic Engineer post you referenced is one of the clearer “bridge” explanations. Hamel’s more recent evals FAQ expands the same philosophy into concrete practices. For LLM-as-judge details and known issues, MT-Bench and the surrounding literature are still useful, and there are newer papers focused specifically on judge bias and reliability if you want to go deeper.\n\n***This link dump is from a notepad I have; I just had gpt-5 put it in a some semblance of order that makes more sense for your use case (Husain's FAQ, second link down, is in and of itself, a small gold mine of compiled info that he dropped last week):***\n\nWorkflow and methodology\n\n* [Pragmatic Engineer: A pragmatic guide to LLM evals for devs](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/evals?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [Hamel Husain: LLM Evals FAQ (Jan 2026)](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals-faq/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [Anthropic Engineering: Demystifying evals for AI agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [OpenAI Docs: Evals guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [OpenAI Evals (GitHub)](https://github.com/openai/evals?utm_source=chatgpt.com) \\*quite dated\n\nTools and platforms (trace-first, eval runs, CI)\n\n* [DeepEval docs: metrics and LLM evals (G-Eval)](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-llm-evals?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [Arize Phoenix: evaluating traces](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/how-to-tracing/feedback-and-annotations/evaluating-phoenix-traces?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [OpenInference overview](https://arize.com/docs/ax/observe/tracing-concepts/what-is-openinference?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [LangSmith: evaluation docs](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/evaluation?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [LangChain blog: multi-turn evals with LangSmith](https://www.blog.langchain.com/insights-agent-multiturn-evals-langsmith/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [Ragas documentation](https://docs.ragas.io/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [TruLens: getting started](https://www.trulens.org/getting_started/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nLLM-as-judge reliability (biases, failure modes, guidelines)\n\n* [MT-Bench / Chatbot Arena: Judging LLM-as-a-Judge (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [Position bias study (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07791?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [Self-bias / family-bias: Play Favorites (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06709?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [Principles and Guidelines for LLM Judges (PDF)](https://www.cs.unh.edu/~dietz/papers/dietz2025principles.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [Prometheus evaluator model (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08491?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nText-to-SQL specific evaluation\n\n* [BIRD benchmark](https://bird-bench.github.io/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [Snowflake Engineering: Cortex Analyst text-to-SQL eval](https://www.snowflake.com/en/engineering-blog/cortex-analyst-text-to-sql-accuracy-bi/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [PICARD constrained decoding (ACL Anthology)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.779/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [Pervasive annotation errors break text-to-SQL (arXiv HTML)](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.08778v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [TeCoD: Template Constrained Decoding (ACM)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3769822?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* [PVLDB survey: Text-to-SQL with LLMs (PDF)](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol17/p1132-gao.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",
