      "text": "OpenClaw has been trending for all the wrong and right reasons. I saw people rebuilding entire sites through Telegram, running “AI offices,” and one case where an agent wiped thousands of emails because of a prompt injection. That made me stop and actually look at the architecture instead of the demos.\n\nUnder the hood, it’s simpler than most people expect.\n\nOpenClaw runs as a persistent Node.js process on your machine. There’s a single Gateway that binds to localhost and manages all messaging platforms at once: WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord. Every message flows through that one process. It handles authentication, routing, session loading, and only then passes control to the agent loop. Responses go back out the same path. No distributed services. No vendor relay layer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyqx126xqgkg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aa9645ac1855c337ea73226697f4718cd175205\n\nWhat makes it feel different from ChatGPT-style tools is persistence. It doesn’t reset. Conversation history, instructions, tools, even long-term memory are just files under `~/clawd/`. Markdown files. No database. You can open them, version them, diff them, roll them back. The agent reloads this state every time it runs, which is why it remembers what you told it last week.\n\nThe heartbeat mechanism is the interesting part. A cron wakes it up periodically, runs cheap checks first (emails, alerts, APIs), and only calls the LLM if something actually changed. That design keeps costs under control while allowing it to be proactive. It doesn’t wait for you to ask.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gv6eld93rgkg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a6590c390c4d99fe7fe306f75681a2e4dbe0dbe\n\nThe security model is where things get real. The system assumes the LLM can be manipulated. So enforcement lives at the Gateway level: allow lists, scoped permissions, sandbox mode, approval gates for risky actions. But if you give it full shell and filesystem access, you’re still handing a probabilistic model meaningful control. The architecture limits blast radius, it doesn’t eliminate it.\n\nWhat stood out to me is that nothing about OpenClaw is technically revolutionary. The pieces are basic: WebSockets, Markdown files, cron jobs, LLM calls. The power comes from how they’re composed into a persistent, inspectable agent loop that runs locally.\n\nIt’s less “magic AI system” and more “LLM glued to a long-running process with memory and tools.”\n\nI wrote down the detailed breakdown [here](https://entelligence.ai/blogs/openclaw)",

Note: your tools automated analysis touches on it in the following section, “The Agent Loop: From Message to Action” and probably elsewhere but should go deeper because how these 2 components work is key to how OpenClaw works. \n\nNote: I’m thinking the review tool should really detect and break out key sub-projects with the why, how, and what as a sub-project relates to the parent project. \n\nOpenClaw is an amazing experiment built on top of some amazing open source. \n\nNote: The automated code review tool you’re building that did the actual analysis did a very reasonable job but I think it’s still a bit too surface detail oriented - imo anyway. That said I suppose one could use this report as part of the “brainstorming” stage and use sections from the report when delving deeper. Basically I’m saying more meat is needed on the bone to use this as a blueprint - though that might not be the point of this report and the tool cdn actually go deeper already (Yes/No)?\n\nCheers,\n\nChristopher",

          "text": "The only point that I would disagree on, is that prompt engineering, especially advanced prompt engineering, is about understanding the ways that the AI model might misunderstand, because of how they work. You might say that is just communication skills, but it is about understanding how they function way deeper than someone who just communicates clearly.\n\nFor example, if I spend 50% of my prompt to a text-to-image generation model, describing a specific aspect of the image, then it is going to notice that, and it will generate the picture very differently, focusing more on that aspect, than if I say what is essentially the same thing with less words. But the order that I mention things matters as well. If I am generating an image and at the end of my prompt I say something that the AI model doesn't do, I could move that sentence to the beginning of my prompt, and it would have higher priority.\n\nOne time I was trying to generate an image and my prompt contained the phrase \"flight of stairs\", and after many failed generations where the stairs were floating, and me not understanding why, I realized that the word \"flight\" although used correctly, was confusing the model, and removing it fixed the outputs.\n\nA person that is exceptional at communication is not automatically a good prompt engineer, because they don't understand these things. Specific models have their own tendencies and prompt-following quirks as well, across all mediums of AI models, so you could also argue that part of being a good prompt engineer is learning these tendencies.\n\nSo being able to communicate effectively can make you rapidly progress while learning prompt engineering, but to say that they are the same skill is not understanding the full depth of prompt engineering.",

The focus is a pure NVFP4 fast path: FP8 KV cache, custom FP8 decode kernel, no silent FP16 fallback. It currently targets Qwen3 (dense + MoE) and Gemma3 (including sliding-window layers), I'll be adding support to other models soon.\n\n>**Please think of giving the Github repo a STAR if you like it :)**\n\n# Why this is interesting\n\n* NVFP4-first runtime for Ada GPUs (tested on RTX 4090) with FP8 KV cache end-to-end.\n* Custom Triton FP8 decode kernel; prefill uses FlashAttention (varlen).\n* No FP16 fallback for decode. If FP8 kernel fails, it errors out instead of silently switching.\n* Tensor-parallel (NCCL) + CUDA graphs for decode (also support eager mode)\n\n# Benchmarks (RTX 4090)\n\n**Qwen3-8B-NVFP4**\n\n|batch|total tokens|seconds|tok/s|peak GB|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|128|3.3867|37.79|7.55|\n|2|256|3.5471|72.17|7.55|\n|4|512|3.4392|148.87|7.55|\n|8|1024|3.4459|297.16|7.56|\n|16|2048|4.3636|469.34|7.56|\n\n**Gemma3-27B-it-NVFP4**\n\n|batch|total tokens|seconds|tok/s|peak GB|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|128|9.3982|13.62|19.83|\n|2|256|9.5545|26.79|19.83|\n|4|512|9.5344|53.70|19.84|\n\nfor Qwen3-8B-NVFP4 I observed \\~2.4x lower peak VRAM vs Qwen3-8B FP16 baselines (with \\~20-25% throughput loss).\n\n# Quickstart\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/BenChaliah/NVFP4-on-4090-vLLM.git\n    \n    adallm serve nvidia/Qwen3-8B-NVFP4\n\n>\\`export NVFP4\\_FP8=1\\` is optional and enables FP8 GEMM path (NVFP4\\_FP8=0: the difference is in compute precision not VRAM, FP8 KV cache + the FP8 decode kernel are still used.\n\n**Supported models (so far)**\n\n* `nvidia/Qwen3-8B-NVFP4`\n* `BenChaliah/Gemma3-27B-it-NVFP4`\n* Qwen3 MoE variants are supported, but still slow (see README for MoE notes).\n\n**Limitations**\n\n* MoE routing and offload paths are not fully optimized yet (working on it currently)\n* Only NVFP4 weights, no FP16 fallback for decode by design.\n* Targeted at Ada Lovelace (sm\\_89).

At the database layer, it mostly comes down to:\n\n* Managing connection lifecycle properly\n* Keeping transactions short\n* Handling long-lived sessions carefully (especially with streaming)\n* Using replicas effectively\n\nIf you mess up connection management, holdconnection hostage, everything falls apart. That’s usually the real bottleneck. With LLM systems, the bottleneck is about GPU compute and memory. The main things are:\n\n* Efficient batching of incoming requests\n* Maximizing GPU utilization\n* Managing KV cache memory properly\n* Supporting high concurrency\n\nModern frameworks like vLLM help a lot here. Things like paged attention, continuous batching, and FlashAttention make it possible to handle large numbers of concurrent requests efficiently. Memory management is critical, but these frameworks abstract a lot of that complexity away.\n\nSo DB scaling is mostly about connection discipline and replication strategy.

The composability, the automation, the skill ecosystem - it felt like the actual paradigm shift.\n\nLately though I'm genuinely worried. We can all be careful about which skills we install, sure. But most people don't realize skills can silently install other skills. No prompt, no notification, no visibility. One legitimate-looking package becomes a dropper for something else entirely, running background jobs you'll never see in your chat history.\n\nWhat does a actually secure OpenClaw implementation even look like?

          "text": "I don’t think the concern is overblown. If skills can silently install other skills and run background jobs with no visibility, that’s a real supply chain and privilege boundary problem.\n\nThe way I think about it is this: don’t treat the agent like a helpful assistant. Treat it like the smartest hacker in the world who happens to be following instructions most of the time.\n\nIf you assume that, a \"secure\" implementation looks very different from the default hobby setup.\n\nFirst, the model shouldn’t have direct power. It shouldn’t have raw network access, raw filesystem access, or ambient credentials sitting in environment variables. It should only be able to request actions.\n\nSecond, every capability should be explicitly defined and allowlisted. No silent skill installs. No transitive dependency installs at runtime. If something gets added, it happens in a controlled build step with review and version pinning.\n\nThird, all external effects should go through a choke point you control. If it wants to send an email, make an HTTP request, write to a database, or touch Slack, it calls a guarded tool. That tool enforces policy, rate limits, domain restrictions, and writes to an immutable audit log. No raw SMTP. No arbitrary outbound HTTP.\n\nFourth, assume it will try to exfiltrate if it can. That means default deny on network egress, strict sandboxing, and strong logging that lives outside the agent runtime.\n\nIs there a \"perfect\" secure setup that still keeps full utility? Probably not. The more useful the agent is, the more power it needs. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s constrained, mediated power with visibility and revocability.\n\nSo I wouldn’t say these frameworks are doomed. I’d say most default installs are way too permissive for production. A secure OpenClaw implementation would look less like a plugin playground and more like a tightly sandboxed execution engine with a policy layer in front of every meaningful action.",

I have been using a lot of reactive tools that require me initiating everything so Im enticed by the proactive nature of open claw so I see it as starting with proactive features I want to make a more deterministic implementation of. That said, I was trashing the initial release but i think it is usable for personal setups for informed users now.\n\nI originally planned a series of vms with separate controls but there are several layers of isolation included now in open claw. I'm still configuring an internal only container and an external accessible vm install because I wanted to be as conservative as possible assuming the external facing one will be contaminated but sandboxing seems legitimately incorporated in open claw now where it's not irresponsible now to have one gateway with different agent profiles to achieve similar separation IMO. \n\nBoth my instances are locked down to only be able to use tools I give them. The external one has no access to any sensitive info but can gather information and put it together for me to allow it to save it in my tools. But until I approve it everything is ephemeral in the container sandbox. The second one is internal only with a lot of read only access but any write requires my approval. So that allows it to proactively review solutions without compromising my tools.\n\nInsider threat is always the most dangerous and even more so with tools that replicate human logic but lack the ability to actually think.",

Silent skill installation is a supply chain attack surface and most users have no idea it exists. You're not just trusting the skill, you're trusting everything that skill decides to pull in at runtime.\n\nA \"secure\" OpenClaw implementation would need at minimum: process-level isolation per skill so a compromised package can't read memory or environment variables from the agent runtime, network egress controls so background jobs can't phone home, and some kind of attestation that what's running matches what you installed. None of that exists out of the box.\n\nThe deeper issue is that the whole skill ecosystem is built on implicit trust. Skills run in the same execution context as the agent, which means they have access to everything the agent has access to  credentials, session tokens, whatever's in the environment. A dropper skill doesn't need to escalate privileges, it already has them.\n\nDocker helps at the surface level but shared kernel is a real limitation here  if a skill finds a kernel exploit, the container boundary doesn't save you. The honest answer is that a properly isolated implementation needs the skill execution to happen in a separate environment with explicit, audited permissions for every outbound action. Most people are nowhere near that and don't realize it.",

GPT-5.2 at low reasoning scores 0.604. That is not a rounding error and it has real cost implications for anyone running at scale.\n\nAt high reasoning it ties Gemini 3 Pro Preview at the top of our leaderboard with 0.719 overall, ahead of GPT-5.2 high at 0.649.\n\nHallucination resistance hits 0.921, the highest of any model we have tested. Gemini 3 Pro sits at 0.820, GPT-5.2 at 0.655. Social calibration at 0.905 and error detection at 0.848 are similarly the best we have seen.\n\nTo give credit where it is due, Gemini 3 Pro is still the better call for hard science. Philosophy 0.900 vs 0.767, chemistry 0.839 vs 0.710, economics 0.812 vs 0.750. It is not a sweep.\n\nThe honest caveat is sycophancy resistance at 0.716 is actually slightly below Sonnet 4.5 at high reasoning which scored 0.755. For a company that talks about this a lot, that is worth watching.\n\nIf reliability and hallucination resistance are your primary eval criteria nothing beats it right now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tj3yyj5t5bkg1.png?width=2588&format=png&auto=webp&s=260eac02f897164ffda778e0f332fe2b6df92890\n\n",

For any application where the model is making recommendations or surfacing information to end users, hallucination is a trust killer that is hard to recover from.\n\nThe sycophancy regression is worth flagging though. In ad-adjacent applications where you are trying to get honest signal from a model about user intent, a model that agrees too readily is actually worse than one that pushes back. Curious if your benchmark breaks that down by prompt type at all.\n\nThe cost angle you raised on non-reasoning Sonnet beating GPT-5.2 with reasoning is underrated. At scale that is not just a cost story, it is a latency story too. What does the benchmark show on response consistency across runs?",

I've built a few projects for myself and feel confident in my technical abilities, but now I'm looking to transition this into actual client work.\n\nBefore I jump in, I'd really appreciate learning from people who've already walked this path. If you've sold RAG solutions to clients, I'd love to hear about your experience:\n\n**Client & Project Details:**\n\n* What types of clients/industries did you work with?\n* How did they discover they needed RAG? (Did they come asking for it, or did you identify the use case?)\n* What was the scope? (customer support, internal knowledge base, document search, etc.)\n\n**Delivery & Timeline:**\n\n* How long did the project take from discovery to delivery?\n* What were the biggest technical challenges you faced?\n* Did you handle ongoing maintenance, or was it a one-time delivery?\n\n**Business Side:**\n\n* How did you find these clients? (freelance platforms, LinkedIn outreach, referrals, content marketing, etc.)\n* What did you charge? (ballpark is fine, just trying to understand market rates)\n* How did you structure pricing? (fixed project, hourly, monthly retainer?)\n\n**Post-Delivery:**\n\n* Were clients happy with the results?\n* Did you iterate/improve the system after launch?\n* Any lessons learned that you'd do differently next time?\n\nThanks !",
