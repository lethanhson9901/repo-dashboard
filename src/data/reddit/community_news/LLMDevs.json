The mods said it's ok if I post this here. \n\nWe’ve just released a book that’s very much aimed at the kinds of problems this community discusses all the time: what to do when a general-purpose LLM is technically impressive but awkward, expensive, or inefficient for your actual use case.\n\n**Rearchitecting LLMs** by Pere Martra  \n[https://www.manning.com/books/rearchitecting-llms](https://hubs.la/Q042-hLy0)\n\n[Rearchitecting LLMs by Pere Martra](https://preview.redd.it/vyy079zx78jg1.jpg?width=2213&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=755a8b1ab1320ede5daedfa861d6ab8d1b0c5e5d)\n\nThe core idea of the book is simple but powerful: instead of treating open models as fixed artifacts, you can reshape them. Pere walks through structural techniques like targeted fine-tuning, pruning, and knowledge distillation to build smaller, cheaper, domain-focused models that still perform well on the tasks you care about.\n\nWhat makes this book interesting is how hands-on it gets. You’re not working with abstract toy networks. The examples focus on modifying widely used open models, such as Llama-3, Gemma, and Qwen. The focus is on understanding which parts of a model actually contribute to behavior, how to identify waste or redundancy, and how to remove or compress components without blindly wrecking performance.\n\nThere’s also some genuinely thoughtful material on combining behavioral analysis with structural changes. Instead of just cutting parameters and hoping for the best, the book explores ways to reason about why a modification works or fails. One section that tends to spark discussion is “fair pruning,” where pruning is used not only for efficiency but also to reduce bias at the neuron level.\n\nIf you’re working on local models, cost-constrained deployments, or specialized SLMs, this book is very much in that territory. It’s written for people who are comfortable with LLM concepts and want to go deeper into how models can be reshaped rather than simply prompted.\n\n**For the** r/LLMDevs **community:**  \nYou can get **50% off** with the code **MLMARTRA50RE**.\n\nA quick note on availability: the book is currently in **MEAP (Manning Early Access Program)**. That means you get immediate access to the chapters as they’re written, along with updates as the manuscript evolves.\n\nHappy to bring the author to answer questions about the book, the techniques it covers, or the kinds of readers it’s best suited for. And I’d be curious to hear from folks here who are already doing pruning or distillation in practice — what’s been harder than expected?\n\nI'm ready to give away 5 ebooks to the first five commenters who share their experience here.\n\nThank you all for having us. It feels great to be here.\n\nCheers,",

Here are some examples of what the book covers:\n\n\\- End-to-End Model Re-architecting (Chapter 2): Transform Gemma-3-270M using depth pruning and knowledge distillation for a 10% speed increase while retaining 93-98% of original capabilities in a hands-on project.\n\n\\- Data-Driven Pruning (Chapters 4-5): Create two models from the same base (Qwen3-0.6B or Llama-3.2-1B): one for formal texts (WikiText) and another for short messages (SMS Spam), using activation analysis with PyTorch hooks to highlight domain-specific component importance.\n\n\\- Bias Auditing and Correction: In ethics chapters, perform a model \"cleanup\" using ablation frameworks and PCA visualization to identify and mitigate demographic biases, achieving fairness without full retraining.\n\n\\- Mini-Capstone: Utilize a small \"draft model\" to speed up LLM inference by quickly proposing tokens, validated by a larger model.\n\n\\- Capstone Project: Migrate an agent system from costly external APIs to a specialized local Small Language Model (SLM).\n\nHope this helps.",

I could basically train a model for my iPhone, let's say I export all my email and scrub PII, format for training data and then I could fine-tune to write mails that look somewhat within the realm of my own style? \n\nI haven't looked into training or fine tuning as I couldn't think of a personal use case for these tiny models, but like you're saying \"domain-focused\", gave a clearer picture.\n\nThis is a little over my current scope as I'm not even sure if I understood this correctly, but I've been thinking of ways to make a digital twin that could handle writing across multiple platforms. Was always thinking Id need a larger model to handle such a task because it sounds easy enough, but capturing the essence of one's writing is quite a complex task for llms. At least in my experience.\n\nThanks for the info.",

              "text": "Hi u/StackSmashRepeat \n\nI'll give you a rough explanation and if you want more details just ask me. \n\nIn the book I explain an LLM optimization / customization pipeline. The pipeline basically consists of: \n\n1- Pruning (depth and width) which is removing parts of a model. \n\n2- Knowledge Distillation. Recovering the lost knowledge by transferring it from the base model to the pruned one. \n\n3- Finetuning on a specialized domain. \n\nDuring this pipeline you gain knowledge about how models work internally, since to decide which parts to remove we study how activations are produced detecting the mos important parts. \n\nWe take advantage of this knowledge to do surgical operations on the model in the more advanced chapters, like replacing attention layers or changing the behaviour of the model modifying the weights of some neurons. \n\nThe pipeline is very similar to what companies like Nvidia or Mistral follow to create their model families, but adapted to create specific models,  and using less data and processing capacity than they have.   \n  \nFor example in width pruning Mistral uses a completely dynamic model to detect which weights to remove, in the book we use a combination that rewards keeping neurons with high importance, so with much less data you can get an efficient model. \n\nAlthough it really seems very complicated we start from the simplest things, basic depth pruning, in chapter 2 you already remove parts of a model and recover the lost knowledge. \n\nFrom this base you build the knowledge that leads you to the more advanced techniques. \n\nThen there's a second intention which is to make cutting-edge research understandable, so in each chapter starting from the fourth, there's an explanation of which papers the chapter's code is based on and how we've adapted it when implementing it. \n\nFor example the development of width pruning in modern models like Llama or Gemma is based on a paper which we've changed a good part of the formulas to simplify it but keeping its general idea. \n\nI hope the explanation was useful! \n\nPere.",

The composability, the automation, the skill ecosystem - it felt like the actual paradigm shift.\n\nLately though I'm genuinely worried. We can all be careful about which skills we install, sure. But most people don't realize skills can silently install other skills. No prompt, no notification, no visibility. One legitimate-looking package becomes a dropper for something else entirely, running background jobs you'll never see in your chat history.\n\nWhat does a actually secure OpenClaw implementation even look like?

If skills can silently install other skills and run background jobs with no visibility, that’s a real supply chain and privilege boundary problem.\n\nThe way I think about it is this: don’t treat the agent like a helpful assistant. Treat it like the smartest hacker in the world who happens to be following instructions most of the time.\n\nIf you assume that, a \"secure\" implementation looks very different from the default hobby setup.\n\nFirst, the model shouldn’t have direct power. It shouldn’t have raw network access, raw filesystem access, or ambient credentials sitting in environment variables. It should only be able to request actions.\n\nSecond, every capability should be explicitly defined and allowlisted. No silent skill installs. No transitive dependency installs at runtime. If something gets added, it happens in a controlled build step with review and version pinning.\n\nThird, all external effects should go through a choke point you control. If it wants to send an email, make an HTTP request, write to a database, or touch Slack, it calls a guarded tool. That tool enforces policy, rate limits, domain restrictions, and writes to an immutable audit log. No raw SMTP. No arbitrary outbound HTTP.\n\nFourth, assume it will try to exfiltrate if it can. That means default deny on network egress, strict sandboxing, and strong logging that lives outside the agent runtime.\n\nIs there a \"perfect\" secure setup that still keeps full utility? Probably not. The more useful the agent is, the more power it needs. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s constrained, mediated power with visibility and revocability.\n\nSo I wouldn’t say these frameworks are doomed.

              "text": "Agreed. To their credit, tons of folks were excited to help something like this and made it a totally different project IMO. There's now various ways to increase isolation. I have been using a lot of reactive tools that require me initiating everything so Im enticed by the proactive nature of open claw so I see it as starting with proactive features I want to make a more deterministic implementation of. That said, I was trashing the initial release but i think it is usable for personal setups for informed users now.\n\nI originally planned a series of vms with separate controls but there are several layers of isolation included now in open claw. I'm still configuring an internal only container and an external accessible vm install because I wanted to be as conservative as possible assuming the external facing one will be contaminated but sandboxing seems legitimately incorporated in open claw now where it's not irresponsible now to have one gateway with different agent profiles to achieve similar separation IMO. \n\nBoth my instances are locked down to only be able to use tools I give them. The external one has no access to any sensitive info but can gather information and put it together for me to allow it to save it in my tools. But until I approve it everything is ephemeral in the container sandbox. The second one is internal only with a lot of read only access but any write requires my approval. So that allows it to proactively review solutions without compromising my tools.\n\nInsider threat is always the most dangerous and even more so with tools that replicate human logic but lack the ability to actually think.",

Silent skill installation is a supply chain attack surface and most users have no idea it exists. You're not just trusting the skill, you're trusting everything that skill decides to pull in at runtime.\n\nA \"secure\" OpenClaw implementation would need at minimum: process-level isolation per skill so a compromised package can't read memory or environment variables from the agent runtime, network egress controls so background jobs can't phone home, and some kind of attestation that what's running matches what you installed. None of that exists out of the box.\n\nThe deeper issue is that the whole skill ecosystem is built on implicit trust. Skills run in the same execution context as the agent, which means they have access to everything the agent has access to  credentials, session tokens, whatever's in the environment. A dropper skill doesn't need to escalate privileges, it already has them.\n\nDocker helps at the surface level but shared kernel is a real limitation here  if a skill finds a kernel exploit, the container boundary doesn't save you. The honest answer is that a properly isolated implementation needs the skill execution to happen in a separate environment with explicit, audited permissions for every outbound action. Most people are nowhere near that and don't realize it.",

GPT-5.2 at low reasoning scores 0.604. That is not a rounding error and it has real cost implications for anyone running at scale.\n\nAt high reasoning it ties Gemini 3 Pro Preview at the top of our leaderboard with 0.719 overall, ahead of GPT-5.2 high at 0.649.\n\nHallucination resistance hits 0.921, the highest of any model we have tested. Gemini 3 Pro sits at 0.820, GPT-5.2 at 0.655. Social calibration at 0.905 and error detection at 0.848 are similarly the best we have seen.\n\nTo give credit where it is due, Gemini 3 Pro is still the better call for hard science. Philosophy 0.900 vs 0.767, chemistry 0.839 vs 0.710, economics 0.812 vs 0.750. It is not a sweep.\n\nThe honest caveat is sycophancy resistance at 0.716 is actually slightly below Sonnet 4.5 at high reasoning which scored 0.755.

In ad-adjacent applications where you are trying to get honest signal from a model about user intent, a model that agrees too readily is actually worse than one that pushes back. Curious if your benchmark breaks that down by prompt type at all.\n\nThe cost angle you raised on non-reasoning Sonnet beating GPT-5.2 with reasoning is underrated. At scale that is not just a cost story, it is a latency story too. What does the benchmark show on response consistency across runs?",

      "text": "OpenClaw has been trending for all the wrong and right reasons. I saw people rebuilding entire sites through Telegram, running “AI offices,” and one case where an agent wiped thousands of emails because of a prompt injection. That made me stop and actually look at the architecture instead of the demos.\n\nUnder the hood, it’s simpler than most people expect.\n\nOpenClaw runs as a persistent Node.js process on your machine. There’s a single Gateway that binds to localhost and manages all messaging platforms at once: WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord. Every message flows through that one process. It handles authentication, routing, session loading, and only then passes control to the agent loop. Responses go back out the same path. No distributed services. No vendor relay layer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyqx126xqgkg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aa9645ac1855c337ea73226697f4718cd175205\n\nWhat makes it feel different from ChatGPT-style tools is persistence. It doesn’t reset. Conversation history, instructions, tools, even long-term memory are just files under `~/clawd/`. Markdown files. No database. You can open them, version them, diff them, roll them back. The agent reloads this state every time it runs, which is why it remembers what you told it last week.\n\nThe heartbeat mechanism is the interesting part. A cron wakes it up periodically, runs cheap checks first (emails, alerts, APIs), and only calls the LLM if something actually changed. That design keeps costs under control while allowing it to be proactive. It doesn’t wait for you to ask.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gv6eld93rgkg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a6590c390c4d99fe7fe306f75681a2e4dbe0dbe\n\nThe security model is where things get real. The system assumes the LLM can be manipulated. So enforcement lives at the Gateway level: allow lists, scoped permissions, sandbox mode, approval gates for risky actions. But if you give it full shell and filesystem access, you’re still handing a probabilistic model meaningful control. The architecture limits blast radius, it doesn’t eliminate it.\n\nWhat stood out to me is that nothing about OpenClaw is technically revolutionary. The pieces are basic: WebSockets, Markdown files, cron jobs, LLM calls. The power comes from how they’re composed into a persistent, inspectable agent loop that runs locally.\n\nIt’s less “magic AI system” and more “LLM glued to a long-running process with memory and tools.”\n\nI wrote down the detailed breakdown [here](https://entelligence.ai/blogs/openclaw)",

      "text": "Hello! If you don't know me, my name is Brian Heseung Kim (@brhkim in most places). I have been at the frontier of finding rigorous, careful, and auditable ways of using LLMs and their predecessors in social science research since roughly 2018, when I thought: hey, machine learning seems like kind of a big deal that [I probably need to learn more about](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ShZeS2wRWu_ifWREfctj3D4TyYZch0hL/view?usp=drive_link). When I saw the massive potential for research of all kinds as well as the extreme dangers of mis-use, I then focused my [entire Ph.D. dissertation](https://libraetd.lib.virginia.edu/public_view/nz806060w) trying to teach others how to use these new tools responsibly (finished in mid-2022, many months before ChatGPT had even been released!). Today, I [continue](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/0013189X241276814) to [work](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/00028312241292309) on [that frontier](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11162-025-09847-5) and lead the data science and research wing for a large education non-profit using many of these approaches (though please note that I am currently working on DAAF solely in my capacity as a private individual and independent researcher).\n\nEarlier this week, I launched [**DAAF**, the **D**ata **A**nalyst **A**ugmentation **F**ramework](https://github.com/DAAF-Contribution-Community/daaf): an open-source, extensible workflow for Claude Code that allows skilled researchers to rapidly scale their expertise and accelerate data analysis by as much as 5-10x -- without sacrificing the transparency, rigor, or reproducibility demanded by our core scientific principles. I built it specifically so that quantitative researchers of all stripes can install and begin using it **in as little as 10 minutes** from a fresh computer with a high-usage Anthropic account (crucial caveat, unfortunately very expensive!). Analyze any or all of the 40+ foundational public education datasets available via the [Urban Institute Education Data Portal](https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/) out-of-the-box as a useful proof-of-concept; it is readily extensible to any new data domain with a suite of built-in tools to ingest new data sources and craft new domain knowledge Skill files at will.\n\nDAAF explicitly embraces the fact that LLM-based research assistants will never be perfect and can never be trusted as a matter of course. But by providing strict guardrails, enforcing best practices, and ensuring the highest levels of auditability possible, DAAF ensures that LLM research assistants can still be **immensely valuable** for critically-minded researchers capable of verifying and reviewing their work. In energetic and vocal opposition to deeply misguided attempts to replace human researchers, DAAF is intended to be a **force-multiplying \"exo-skeleton\"** for human researchers (i.e., firmly keeping humans-in-the-loop).\n\nWith DAAF, you can go from a research question to a \\*shockingly\\* nuanced research report with sections for key findings, data/methodology, and limitations, as well as bespoke data visualizations, with only 5mins of active engagement time, plus the necessary time to fully review and audit the results (see my [10-minute video demo walkthrough](https://youtu.be/ZAM9OA0AlUs)). To that crucial end of facilitating expert human validation, all projects come complete with a fully reproducible, documented analytic code pipeline and notebooks for exploration. Then: request revisions, rethink measures, conduct new sub-analyses, run robustness checks, and even add additional deliverables like interactive dashboards, policymaker-focused briefs, and more -- all with just a quick ask to Claude. And all of this can be done \\*in parallel\\* with multiple projects simultaneously.\n\nBy open-sourcing DAAF under the GNU LGPLv3 license as a **forever-free and open and extensible framework**, I hope to provide a foundational resource that the entire community of researchers and data scientists can use, benefit from, learn from, and extend via critical conversations and collaboration together. By pairing DAAF with an intensive array of **educational materials, tutorials, blog deep-dives, and videos** via project documentation and the [DAAF Field Guide Substack](https://daafguide.substack.com/) (MUCH more to come!), I also hope to rapidly accelerate the readiness of the scientific community to genuinely and critically engage with AI disruption and transformation writ large.\n\nI don't want to oversell it: DAAF is far from perfect (much more on that in the full README!). But it is already extremely useful, and my intention is that this is the **worst that DAAF will ever** be from now on given the rapid pace of AI progress and (hopefully) community contributions from here. [Learn more about my vision for DAAF](https://github.com/DAAF-Contribution-Community/daaf#vision--purpose), what makes DAAF different from standard LLM assistants, what DAAF currently can and cannot do as of today, how you can get involved, and how you can get started with DAAF yourself! Never used Claude Code? Not sure how to start? [My full installation guide](https://github.com/DAAF-Contribution-Community/daaf/blob/main/user_reference/01_installation_and_quickstart.md) and in-depth tutorials walk you through every step -- but hopefully this video shows how quick a [full DAAF installation can be from start-to-finish.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqkVLXA1CV4) Just 3 minutes in real-time!\n\nWith all that in mind, I would \\*love\\* to hear what you think, what your questions are, how this needs to be improved, and absolutely every single critical thought you’re willing to share. Thanks for reading and engaging earnestly!",
