      "text": "I just finished reading *Agentic Design Patterns: A Hands-On Guide to Building Intelligent Systems*, and wanted to share some thoughts from an LLM dev perspective.\n\nThe author, Antonio Gulli (Google Cloud AI), clearly writes from an engineering background. This isn’t a trends or hype book — it’s very focused on how to actually structure agentic systems that go beyond single-call prompting.\n\nWhat the book focuses on\n\nInstead of models or benchmarks, the book frames agent development around **design patterns**, similar to classic software engineering.\n\nIt addresses a question many of us run into:\n\nHow do you turn LLM calls into reliable, multi-step, long-running systems?\n\nThe book is organized around \\~20 agentic patterns, including:\n\n* Prompt chaining, routing, and planning\n* Tool use and context engineering\n* Memory, RAG, and adaptation\n* Multi-agent coordination and communication\n* Guardrails, evaluation, and failure recovery\n\nMost chapters include concrete code examples (LangChain / LangGraph / CrewAI / Google tooling), not just conceptual diagrams.\n\nWhat I found useful as a dev\n\nPersonally, the biggest value was:\n\n* A clearer **mental model for agent workflows**, not just “agent = loop”\n* Better intuition for when to decompose into multiple agents vs a single one\n* Practical framing of context engineering and memory management\n* Realistic discussion of limitations (reasoning, evaluation, safety)\n\nIt helped me reason more systematically about why many agent demos break down when you try to scale or productize them.\n\nWho this is probably for\n\n* LLM devs building agentic workflows or internal tools\n* People moving from single-call pipelines to multi-step systems\n* Engineers thinking about production reliability, not just demos\n\nIf you’re mostly interested in model internals or training, this may not be your thing. If you’re focused on **system design around LLMs**, it’s worth a look.\n\nIf anyone here has read it, I’d be curious to hear your take.",

This means the real constraint isn't compute power anymore. It's memory bandwidth.\n\nThat's not how it works. Memory bandwidth has nothing to do with the entire model size, because you are not processing the whole MoE model. You need to load the whole model in RAM, so what matters is the quantity of RAM. Then you can estimate token generation speed dividing memory bandwidth by active parameters.\n\nThat said, AMD loves to advertise false memory bandwidths for its CPUs. You can only saturate the theoretical bandwidth if CPU-bus bandwidth is at least the same. If not, that's a bottleneck. Only higher count (and higher cost) Epyc CPUs have enough chiplets and links to saturate the bandwidth. Sadly, you need an 8+ chiplets SKU, which coupled with 12 sticks of fast RAM is going to cost more than 5k.\n\nOnce you have selected the right CPU and RAM, you have a high bandwidth system. Which is very good at token generation, no doubt about that, but very slow at prompt processing where only FLOPS matter.",

On a CPU, you don't hit the bandwidth ceiling.. you hit the compute ceiling first. You're not solving the problem, you're just trading a bandwidth bottleneck for a worse compute bottleneck.\n\nTheir whole argument is based on batch size = 1, which is not how production LLMs run. The moment you're batching requests, compute dominates again. LLMs are massively parallelized matrix multiplication.. you can't compare a GPU with thousands of cores to an EPYC with 128.\n\nAnd then there's efficiency. We measure hardware on FLOPs per watt. Yeah, a 5090 will suck every electron out of your socket, but it's nowhere near as much of a pig as a 128-core system burning more watts *per token*.\n\nNo offense intended, but this reads like a senior software engineer writing about ML infrastructure without the background. There's a lot of research that's explored the \"should we just CPU it\" angle and they all pretty much land on: technically doable, massively wasteful.",

Instead, simply tag them as Model A, B, C, etc.\n* More importantly, tone down your step 3 prompt a bit, especially on the “find errors” part. All the counsel, quorum, debate, and peer-review workflows can have a significant impact on the quality of the output, both positively and negatively. The crucial point is to determine the right balance between encouraging the model to find errors and avoiding over-reliance on it. If you simply provide the context of the situation, as you clearly do, the model will naturally follow your instructions. You already have ‘weaknesses’ in the JSON format, so there’s no need for the last four bullet points in step 3. Honestly, your approach is 90% better than many that I’ve seen.\n\nPeople are out there literally telling the model to go into attack mode, and wondering why it's entertaining but so worthless.\n\nAlso, if you ever want to use your subscriptions instead of API keys only, this is a gem: [https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPIPlus](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPIPlus)",

Issues with reliability kept showing up during agent evaluation, and then some runs were failing in ways it felt hard to predict. Plus the latency and cost variation just became hard to justify or control, especially when the tasks looked similar on paper.\n\nSo first I focused on prompt design and ReAct loop structure. I changed how the agent was told to reason and the freedom it had during each execution step. Some changes made steps in the process look more coherent and it did lead to fewer obvious mistakes earlier on.\n\nBut when the tasks became wider the failure modes kept appearing. The agent was drifting or looping. Or sometimes it would commit to an early assumption inside the ReAct loop and just keep executing even when later actions were signalling that reassessment was necessary.\n\nSo I basically concluded that refining the loop only changed surface behavior and there were still deeper issues with reliability. \n\nInstead I shifted towards how execution decisions were handled over time at the orchestration layer. So because many agent systems lock their execution logic upfront and only evaluate outcomes after the run, you can’t intervene until afterwards, where the failure got baked in and you see wasted compute.\n\nIt made sense to intervene during execution instead of after the fact because then you can allocate TTC dynamically while the trajectories unfold. I basically felt like that had a much larger impact on the reliability. It shifted the question from why an agent failed to why the system was allowing an unproductive trajectory to continue unchecked for so long.",

      "text": "Hi everyone! I'm an at Mirascope, a small startup shipping open-source LLM infra. We just shipped v2 of our open-source Python library for typesafe LLM abstractions, and I'd like to share it.\n\n*TL;DR: This is a Python library with solid typing and cross-provider support for streaming, tools, structured outputs, and async, but without the overhead or assumptions of being a framework. Fully open-source and MIT licensed.*\n\nAlso, advance note: All em-dashes in this post were written by hand. It's option+shift+dash on a Macbook keyboard ;)\n\nIf you've felt like LangChain is too heavy and LiteLLM is too thin, Mirascope might be what you're looking for. It's not an \"agent framework\"—it's a set of abstractions so composable that you don't actually need one. Agents are just tool calling in a while loop.\n\nAnd it's got 100% test coverage, including cross-provider end-to-end tests for every features that use VCR to replay real provider responses in CI.\n\nThe pitch: How about a low-level API that's typesafe, Pythonic, cross-provider, exhaustively tested, and intentionally designed?  \n\n\nMirascope's focus is on typesafe, composable abstractions. The core concepts is you have an `llm.Model` that generates `llm.Response`s, and if you want to add tools, structured outputs, async, streaming, or MCP, everything just clicks together nicely. Here are some examples:\n\n    from mirascope import llm\n    \n    model: llm.Model = llm.Model(\"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5\")\n    response: llm.Response = model.call(\"Please recommend a fantasy book\")\n    print(response.text())\n    # > I'd recommend The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss...\n\nOr, if you want streaming, you can use `model.stream(...)`  along with `llm.StreamResponse`:\n\n    from mirascope import llm\n    \n    model: llm.Model = llm.Model(\"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5\")\n    response: llm.StreamResponse = model.stream(\"Do you think Pat Rothfuss will ever publish Doors of Stone?\")\n    \n    for chunk in response.text_stream():\n      print(chunk, flush=True, end=\"\")\n\nEach response has the full message history, which means you can continue generation by calling \\`response.resume\\`:\n\n    from mirascope import llm\n    \n    response = llm.Model(\"openai/gpt-5-mini\").call(\"How can I make a basil mint mojito?\")\n    print(response.text())\n    \n    response = response.resume(\"Is adding cucumber a good idea?\")\n    print(response.text())\n\n`Response.resume` is a cornerstone of the library, since it abstracts state tracking in a very predictable way. It also makes tool calling a breeze. You define tools via the `@llm.tool` decorator, and invoke them directly via the response.\n\n    from mirascope import llm\n    \n    @llm.tool\n    def exp(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n        \"\"\"Compute an exponent\"\"\"\n        return a ** b \n    \n    model = llm.Model(\"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5\")\n    response = model.call(\"What is (42 ** 3) ** 2?\", tools=[exp])\n    \n    while response.tool_calls:\n      print(f\"Calling tools: {response.tool_calls}\")\n      tool_outputs = response.execute_tools()\n      response = response.resume(tool_outputs)\n    \n    print(response.text())\n\nThe `llm.Response` class also allows handling structured outputs in a typesafe way, as it's generic on the structured output format. We support primitive types as well as Pydantic `BaseModel` out of the box:\n\n    from mirascope import llm \n    from pydantic import BaseModel\n    \n    class Book(BaseModel):\n        title: str\n        author: str\n        recommendation: str\n    \n    # nb. the @llm.call decorator is a convenient wrapper.\n    # Equivalent to model.call(f\"Recommend a {genre} book\", format=Book)\n    \n    @llm.call(\"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5\", format=Book)\n    def recommend_book(genre: str):\n      return f\"Recommend a {genre} book.\"\n    \n    response: llm.Response[Book] = recommend_book(\"fantasy\")\n    book: Book = response.parse()\n    print(book)\n    \n\nThe upshot is that if you want to do something sophisticated—like a streaming tool calling agent—you don't need a framework, you can just compose all these primitives.\n\n    from mirascope import llm\n    \n    @llm.tool\n    def exp(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n        \"\"\"Compute an exponent\"\"\"\n        return a ** b \n    \n    @llm.tool\n    def add(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n        \"\"\"Add two numbers\"\"\"\n        return a + b \n    \n    model = llm.Model(\"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5\")\n    response = model.stream(\"What is 42 ** 4 + 37 ** 3?\", tools=[exp, add])\n    \n    while True:\n        for chunk in response.pretty_stream():\n            print(chunk, flush=True, end=\"\")\n        if response.tool_calls:\n          tool_output = response.execute_tools()\n          response = response.resume(tool_output) \n        else:\n            break # Agent is finished\n\nI believe that if you give it a spin, it will delight you, whether you're coming from the direction of wanting more portability and convenience than using raw provider SDKs, or wanting more hands-on control than the big agent frameworks. These examples are all runnable, you can run`uv add \"mirascope[all]\"`, and set API keys.\n\nYou can read more in the [docs](https://mirascope.com/docs/learn/llm/quickstart), see the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mirascope/mirascope/tree/main), or join our [Discord](https://mirascope.com/discord-invite).

The difference is in philosophy of how you get there. Pydantic AI uses agents as the core primitive, whereas in Mirascope the primitives are one step \"more atomic\" at the level of LLM models, calls, and requests. Rather than providing a fixed agent as a primitive, we've just made it really easy to roll your own Agent.\n\nMirascope is one step \"closer to metal\" (ie. direct control over the LLM requests you're making, just with really nice APIs), whereas Pydantic gets convenience by going up one layer of abstraction.\n\nFor a lot of use cases both will serve well, but Mirascope takes more of an \"onion\" approach where it's easy to peel back a layer and get more direct control over LLM execution. The upshot is its easy to write Pydantic-style agents using Mirascope, but you also get flexibility over exactly what happens in a way that otherwise wouldn't exist.",

If we can offload the \"logic checking\" to the model's architecture (inference time energy minimization) rather than writing endless Python guardrails, that’s a huge shift in our pipeline.  \n  \nHas anyone played with EBMs for production use cases yet?

      "text": "So pulling data from Salesforce, NetSuite, whatever enterprise systems you're stuck with that part's easy. It's what comes after that's a nightmare.\n\nYou extract everything and now you've got these giant tables, JSON files nested like Russian dolls, and absolutely zero context about what any of it means. Even the fancy LLMs just kinda... stare at it blankly. They can't reason over data when they don't know what \"field\\_7829\" actually represents or how it relates to anything else.\n\nCame across [this article](https://thenewstack.io/how-precog-adds-business-context-to-make-enterprise-data-ai-ready/) talking about adding business context early in the pipeline instead of trying to fix it later but I'm curious, what's actually working for you all?\n\nAre you building out semantic layers? Going heavy on NL to SQL? Experimenting with RAG setups? Or have you just accepted that AI answers on enterprise data are gonna be inconsistent at best?\n\nFeel like everyone's solving this differently and I'd love to hear what's actually holding up in production vs what sounds good in theory",

Already seeing teams move toward simpler options or visual tools like Vellum.\n\nThe \"agent wrapper\" startups mostly fail. Lot of companies are thin wrappers around LLM APIs with agent branding. When big providers add native agent features these become irrelevant. Only ones with real differentiation survive.\n\nReliability becomes the battleground. Demos that work 80% impressed people before. In 2026 that wont cut it. Whoever solves consistent production reliability wins.\n\nEnterprise adoption stays slower than predicted. Most big companies still in pilot mode. Security concerns, integration complexity, unclear ROI. Doesnt change dramatically in one year.\n\nPersonal agents become more common than work agents. Lower stakes, easier to experiment, no approval needed. People automate personal workflows before companies figure out how to do it safely.\n\nNo AGI, no robots taking over.

      "text": "**Hey, I revised this post to clarify a few things and avoid confusion.**\n\nHi everyone. Not sure if this is the right place, but I’m posting here and in the ML subreddit for perspective.\n\n**Context**  \nI run a small AI and automation agency. Most of our work is building AI enabled systems, internal tools, and workflow automations. Our current stack is mainly Python and n8n, which has been more than enough for our typical clients.\n\nRecently, one of our clients referred us to a much larger enterprise organization. I’m under NDA so I can’t share the industry, but these are organizations and individuals operating at a 150M$ plus scale.\n\nThey want:\n\n* A private, offsite web application that functions as internal project and operations management software\n* A custom LLM powered system that is heavily tailored to a narrow and proprietary use case\n* Strong security, privacy, and access controls with everything kept private and controlled\n\nTo be clear upfront, we are not planning to build or train a foundation model from scratch. This would involve using existing models with fine tuning, retrieval, tooling, and system level design.\n\nThey also want us to take ownership of the technical direction of the project. This includes defining the architecture, selecting tooling and deployment models, and coordinating the right technical talent. We are also responsible for building the **core web application and frontend** that the LLM system will integrate into.\n\nThis is expected to be a multi year engagement. Early budget discussions are in the 500k to 2M plus range, with room to expand if it makes sense.\n\n**Our background**\n\n* I come from an IT and infrastructure background with USMC operational experience\n* We have experience operating in enterprise environments and leading projects at this scale, just not in this specific niche use case\n* Hardware, security constraints, and controlled environments are familiar territory\n* I have a strong backend and Python focused SWE co founder\n* We have worked alongside ML engineers before, just not in this exact type of deployment\n\nWhere I’m hoping to get perspective is mostly around **operational and architectural decisions**, not fundamentals.\n\n**What I’m hoping to get input on**\n\n1. **End to end planning at this scope** What roles and functions typically appear, common blind spots, and things people underestimate at this budget level\n2. **Private LLM strategy for niche enterprise use cases** Open source versus hosted versus hybrid approaches, and how people usually think about tradeoffs in highly controlled environments\n3. **Large internal data at the terabyte scale** How realistic this is for LLM workflows, what architectures work in practice, and what usually breaks first\n4. **GPU realities** Reasonable expectations for fine tuning versus inference Renting GPUs early versus longer term approaches When owning hardware actually makes sense, if ever\n\nThey have also asked us to help recruit and vet the right technical talent, which is another reason we want to set this up correctly from the start.\n\nIf you are an ML engineer based in South Florida, feel free to DM me. That said, I’m mainly here for advice and perspective rather than recruiting.\n\n**To preempt the obvious questions**\n\n* No, this is not a scam\n* They approached us through an existing client\n* Yes, this is a step up in terms of domain specificity, not project scale\n* We are not pretending to be experts at everything, which is why we are asking\n\nI’d rather get roasted here than make bad architectural decisions early.\n\nThanks in advance for any insight.  \n  \nEdit - P.S To clear up any confusion, we’re mainly building them a secure internal website with a frontend and backend to run their operations, and then layering a private LLM on top of that.\n\nThey basically didn’t want to spend months hiring people, talking to vendors, and figuring out who the fuck they actually needed, so they asked us to spearhead the whole thing instead. We own the architecture, find the right people, and drive the build from end to end.\n\nThat’s why from the outside it might look like, “how the fuck did these guys land an enterprise client that wants a private LLM,” when in reality the value is us taking full ownership of the technical and operational side, not just training a model.",

Docs in structured text files are very different than raw docs in PDFs or images.\n\nWithout understanding the project, I can only speak very generally:\n1. Requirements doc (including timeline) + budgeting comes first, which will determine hiring, architecture, hardware, milestones and schedule planning.\n2. Will depend on data security requirements, but the ideal case is to first try private hosted providers if the project allows it. You can stress test to find the actual demand curve and then make an educated guess on the hardware and its financial projections thereafter.\n3. At this scale I'm assuming offline batch doc processing. If self hosted, will need batch optimized inference servers like vllm, and it will be a trade off between speed, accuracy/intelligence, and $$$ but it can be doable. If hosted, then its a matter of negotiating with the provider.\n4. 4bit Qlora fine tune needs 2-4x more VRAM than small-cache inference, full fine tune needs 10-20x more VRAM. Yes you want to rent GPUs at first until you know your exact load and requirements, and if you end up determining that you can keep your own hardware GPUs under constant load then it will pay itself back in about 6 months.\n5. Architecture design roles as soon as possible, because the early planning stage can really make this 2x easier or 8x harder than it needs to be. And someone experienced in this field to accurately asses the hiring candidates, as its hard to tell who is competent vs just well practiced in interivews if you dont have the experience yourself.",

TO TUNE AND TRAIN, you don’t necessarily need more but I’d imagine they want to do this right and not have a months long running task, so you’re realistically looking at a full rack of B200s that would need to be rented, across multiple epochs. \n\nNone of this even considers what they have for SFT datasets, you’ll have to outsource that, Enterprise ops like this will often just use the scale.ai level providers. Just for that custom dataset that you need for RL and really all post-training, they’re looking mid six-figures, potentially less or way more, depending on how messy or clean their data is and how multi modal and parsey things need to get. \n\n**Their current budget might get them a nice RAG.**\n\nThey have no idea what they want , which is typical , they need someone who really knows what they’re doing to sit down and probe the real problems and pain points and goals, and from there , map that to reality. \n\nDo not take this meeting , or if you did, don’t take the engagement, it’s not worth the potential reputation hit to your firm.
