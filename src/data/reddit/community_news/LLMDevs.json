      "text": "It seems like everyone who uses RAG eventually gets frustrated with it. You end up with either poor results from semantic search or complex data pipelines.\n\nAlso - searching for knowledge is only part of the problem for agents. I’ve seen some articles and posts on X, Medium, Reddit, etc about agent memory and in a lot of ways it seems like that’s the natural evolution of RAG. You treat knowledge as a form of semantic memory and one piece of a bigger set of memory requirements. \n\nThere was a paper published from Google late last year about self-evolving agents and another one talking about adaptive agents.\n\nIf you had a good solution to memory, it seems like you could get to the point where these ideas come together and you could use a combination of knowledge, episodic memory, user feedback, etc to make agents actually learn.\n\nSeems like that could be the future for solving agent data. Anyone tried to do this? ",

              "text": "Agree.  I think we haven't reached the necessary maturity in best practice guidance in regards to when which kind and strategy of grounding information injection into the final completion run of an LLM is the right approach.  What mix of forced grounding context injection, dynamic tool calling to get grounding context, sub-agents summarizing from larger bodies to then inject summarized / shortened grounding context etc gives the best bang for the buck?   TBH from production experience, it's still very situation and data specific.  For a fast follower team that does not have the capacity to try out every frontline technology development, an off the shelf (e.g. GCP APIs based) vector store plus reranker plus grounding into a fast model with large context is still going to be a decent outcome IF (!!!) the use case is actually a fit for it and IF (!!) they put a lot of effort in the preparation, custom chunking, extraction, tagging of their content.     \n  \nMy unscientific thesis is that \"standard\" RAG setups are used way to much on a) bad data b) the wrong use case,  not that they are fundamentally bad.    \n  \nAnother thesis: The general approach of rather providing situationally dynamic context vs. relying on foundation model fact knowledge is here to stay until we have models that can be incrementally and continuously trained or tuned at very low cost (and even then, the question is up whether this provides better hallucination control than grounding in the generation context).",

It keeps retrieval portable, deterministic, and easy to debug with stable chunk/card IDs, source text hashes, and reproducible index builds.\n\nFor vectors, when I say “fallback,” I mean I don’t always run semantic search. (a) It can add noise for queries that are heavy on entities, where lexical search performs better; and (b) it increases complexity and cost if used on every query. But when semantic does kick in, say, too few FTS hits or low lexical confidence,  I follow the exact flow you described: run vector search - merge results - rerank - return top-K. I also log diagnostics like backend used, hit counts, scores, and latency.\n\nThat said, I haven’t rolled out embeddings-based retrieval in production yet. The current setup is FTS-first, paired with structured state and ledgers. The hybrid approach is next on the roadmap, once I can safely gate it behind a “semantic miss” golden set to avoid silent drift.\n\nCurious, what’s worked best for you in terms of rerankers or thresholding?",

Not a reasoning failure—a data coverage problem. Adding \\~500 targeted examples would likely fix most of these.\n\n**Takeaway:** For narrow, exact tasks with controllable domains, small models trained from scratch can be practical, inspectable, and cheap to iterate on. Data quality mattered more than scale.\n\nFull technical writeup with training logs, failure analysis, and code: [https://geddydukes.com/blog/tiny-llm](https://geddydukes.com/blog/tiny-llm)\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/geddydukes/tiny\\_llm](https://github.com/geddydukes/tiny_llm)\n\nHappy to answer questions about training dynamics, architecture choices, or the evaluation setup.",

          "text": "I find that I keep moving back and forth between web chat copy/paste and Qwen Code / Copilot Agent Mode etc. What's often missing in the discussions here is what languages and tech stack you are using and the state of the code base. Let me provide an example, I tried to use agents to build a Flutter app from scratch and it was a horrible waste of time. After a week of evenings I gave up and used Gemini Pro on the web instead, that worked great and was many times faster.\n\nWhen you know how to write the code, but see that the AI generates about 80-90% correct code, it's at least for me,, faster to just do copy paste, fix the last 10-20%, than it is to watch the AI correct it self like a trainwreck, retry, test, compile, try to fix something completely unrelated, still fail and announce that it successfully completed the task, remind it and have it try again, until it succeeded but at the same time refactored a bunch of unrelated stuff and left piles of unused code from trial and errors.\n\nFunny thing, once my Flutter app was practically feature complete, I tried Qwen Code again, and this time it actually worked perfectly, my guess is that there were enough code there for it to understand what needed to be done and how to fit it in, as opposed to an empty or nearly empty code base.\n\nFor other projects, I've had better success, HTML/JavaScript/CSS seems to work rather well, and creating boilerplate code in C# also works well, when the right classes are in the context for the AI to know how things should be implemented.\n\nMy point is that how successful you are seems to depend on multiple factors, such as how well the model handles your specific tech stack, and even down to specific versions of libraries, in addition to how clean, large or small your codebase is. And I also suspect that people have different tolerances for watching the AI trainwreck trying to repair it's mistakes, versus doing it them self, and what quality of code they accept. \n\nAt the end of the day, most important, is that every developer needs to own the code that the AI generates, when main branch breaks, or bugs reach customers, it's not AI's fault, it's the developer who needs to own it and fix it.",

We're hoping to get feedback from this community on the ranking logic to make it actually useful for researchers.\n\n**How we're currently filtering:**\n\n* **Source:** Fetches recent arXiv papers (CS.AI, CS.ML, etc.).\n* **Semantic Filter:** Uses embeddings to match papers against a specific natural language research brief (not just keywords).\n* **Classification:** An LLM classifies papers as \"In-Scope,\" \"Adjacent,\" or \"Out.\"\n* **\"Moneyball\" Ranking:** Ranks the shortlist based on author citation velocity (via Semantic Scholar) + abstract novelty.\n* **Output:** Generates plain English summaries for the top hits.\n\n**Current Limitations (It's not perfect):**\n\n* Summaries can hallucinate (LLM randomness).\n* Predicting \"influence\" is incredibly hard and noisy.\n* Category coverage is currently limited to CS.\n\n**I need your help:**\n\n1. If you had to rank papers automatically, what signals would *you* trust? (Author history? Institution? Twitter velocity?)\n2. What is the biggest failure mode of current discovery tools for you?\n3. Would you trust an \"agent\" to pre-read for you, or do you only trust your own skimming?\n\nThe tool is hosted here if you want to break it: [https://research-aiagent.streamlit.app/](https://research-aiagent.streamlit.app/)\n\nCode is open source if anyone wants to contribute or fork it.",

Writing punishes it.**\n\nWith reads, you can abstract away complexity. Wrap different APIs behind a unified interface. Normalize response shapes. The agent can be naive about what's underneath.\n\nWith writes, you can't hide the schema. The agent isn't consuming structure—it's producing it. Every field, every constraint, every relationship needs to be explicit.\n\nUnless you model writes as files.\n\nFiles are a universal interface. The agent already knows JSON, YAML, markdown. The schema isn't embedded in your tool definitions—it's the file format itself.\n\nFour primitives. Not forty.\n\nWrote up the full breakdown with Vercel's d0 results: \n\nhttps://michaellivs.com/blog/architecture-behind-claude-code\n\nCurious if others have hit this same wall with write tools.",

Decisions only occur at explicit, closed boundaries\n\nThe system never acts on streaming or unfinished data.\n\nAll decisions are gated on **closed time windows**.  \nThis eliminated several classes of failure:\n\n* phantom actions caused by transient states\n* rapid oscillation near thresholds\n* overlapping execution paths\n\nIf the boundary is not closed, the system refuses to act.\n\n# 2. “Do nothing” is the safest default\n\nThe system is intentionally biased toward inaction.\n\n* API error → HOLD\n* LLM timeout → HOLD\n* Partial or inconsistent data → HOLD\n* Conflicting signals → HOLD\n\nIn ambiguous situations, *not acting* is considered the safest outcome.\n\n# 3. Strict separation of concerns\n\nThe system is split into independent layers:\n\n* data preparation\n* LLM-based decision\n* execution\n* logging and notification\n* post-action accounting\n\nEach layer can fail independently without cascading into repeated actions  \nor runaway behavior.\n\nFor example, notifications react only to **confirmed state changes**,  \nnot to intended or predicted actions.\n\n# 4. Features that were intentionally removed\n\nSeveral ideas were tested and then removed after increasing operational risk:\n\n* adaptive or performance-based scaling\n* averaging down / martingale behavior\n* intra-window predictions\n* confidence-weighted LLM actions\n* automatic restart into uncertain internal states\n\nThe system became *more stable* by explicitly **not doing these things**.\n\n# Why I’m sharing this\n\nI’m sharing this to **organize and reflect on lessons learned** from operating  \na non-deterministic LLM component in a live system.\n\nThe feedback here is for personal learning and refinement of system design.  \nAny future write-up would be technical and experience-based,  \nnot monetized and not promotional.\n\n# Looking for discussion\n\nI’d appreciate perspectives from people who have:\n\n* deployed LLMs or ML components in always-on systems\n* dealt with non-determinism and failure modes in production\n* strong opinions on fail-safe vs fail-open design\n\nIf this kind of operational discussion is useful (or not), I’d like to know.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/79npeu8hxvgg1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0be3702d0694e3f1ff0f73c9d8b8e4b8fbf3b548\n\n\n\n*Not selling anything here.

Its output isn’t treated as an explanation or a recommendation — it’s a state classification signal. We deliberately stripped away expressive language and made responses repetitive, terse, and sometimes even boring.\n\nOver time, that shifted trust away from the LLM as an “actor” and toward the system as a whole.

No wasted tokens.\n\n# Tech stack\n\n* Go\n* Telegram Bot API\n* Codex CLI / Ollama (future)\n* JSON-based IR\n* robfig/cron\n* Plugin system\n\nCurrent status\n\nIt’s usable and evolving.  \nMain focus now:\n\n* DSL for tasks\n* Better scheduling\n* Memory without huge context\n* More deterministic routing\n\n**It's in progress, so there are bugs yet, let me know if you can help.**\n\n# Repo\n\n[https://github.com/iagomussel/IRon](https://github.com/iagomussel/IRon?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n# Looking for feedback\n\nI’m interested in feedback on:\n\n* Architecture\n* IR format\n* DSL ideas\n* Similar projects\n* Security concerns\n\nIf you’re into local AI, automation, or agent systems, I’d love your thoughts.\n\nThanks 🙌",

      "text": "If you’re looking into n8n vs Gumloop, you’re probably not trying to find the “best” tool in general. You’re trying to understand which workflow automation platforms actually fit how your team works day to day. That’s where this comparison comes from. I also looked at a [broader comparison table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zQr6iThp2fR-TLNMvSYHgx2ghSrzbYIduO4vX_jlHig/edit?gid=1301024975#gid=1301024975) of workflow automation platforms where n8n is listed, which helped set some baseline context.\n\n# High-level difference\n\n* **Gumloop** is built for business teams that want to automate workflows without involving engineering.\n* **n8n** is built for developer-first teams that want full control, even if that means more setup and maintenance.\n\nThis difference shows up across the product, from the editor to pricing and integrations.\n\n# Ease of use\n\n**Gumloop**  \nGumloop lets you focus on the business problem rather than implementation.\n\n* Visual, easy-to-follow canvas\n* Pre-built actions for common business tools\n* AI features included by default\n* Custom steps without deep technical knowledge\n\nMost teams can get useful workflows running quickly.\n\n**n8n**  \nn8n prioritizes flexibility over simplicity.\n\n* Node-by-node configuration\n* Direct access to APIs, JSON, and JavaScript\n\nYou gain more control, but also more responsibility for building and maintaining workflows.\n\n# Integrations and flexibility\n\nBoth platforms support tools like Google Workspace, Slack, Salesforce, and Notion.\n\n* **n8n** offers broader coverage via community-built nodes, but requires manual setup and upkeep.\n* **Gumloop** focuses on the integrations business teams actually use, with AI-assisted ways to extend them when needed.\n\nIn the **n8n vs Gumloop** comparison, this is often where teams weigh flexibility against effort.\n\n# Pricing and ownership\n\n* **Gumloop** bundles AI models, scraping, enrichment, and data sources into its plans.\n* **n8n** charges per execution, with AI and data services managed and billed separately.\n\nNeither approach is better by default - it depends on whether you prefer bundled convenience or modular control.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nThe real distinction in n8n vs Gumloop is how much work you want around your automation. Gumloop minimizes it early on, while n8n gives you more room later if you’re willing to manage it.\n\nWhich side do you lean toward - simplicity or control?",

Someone refactors a module, and the wiki is already wrong. Nobody updates it until a new engineer asks a question about it.\n\nThis open source project scans your codebases, extracts structured information with LLMs, and generates Markdown documentation with Mermaid diagrams — using CocoIndex + Instructor + Pydantic.\n\nWhat's cool about this example:\n\n• 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 — Only changed files get reprocessed. If you have 20+ projects but only touch one file, CocoIndex only re-analyzes that file — saving 90%+ of LLM cost and compute.\n\n• 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐬 — We use Pydantic models as the schema with Instructor, so the LLM returns real typed objects — classes, functions, signatures, relationships — not brittle free text you have to regex parse.\n\n• 𝐀𝐬𝐲𝐧𝐜 𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 — All files in a project get extracted concurrently with asyncio.gather().\n\n• 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐝 𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐬 — Auto-generated pipeline visualizations showing how your functions connect across the project.\n\n• 𝐇𝐢𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐠𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 — Extracts at file level, then aggregates into a unified project summary. Single-file projects skip the aggregation LLM call entirely.\n\nThink: target\\_state = transformation(source\\_state)\n\nThis pattern hooks naturally into PR flows — run it on every merge and your docs stay current without anyone thinking about it.\n\nIf you want to explore the full example (fully open source, with code, APACHE 2.0), it's here:\n\n👉 [https://cocoindex.io/examples-v1/multi-codebase-summarization](https://cocoindex.io/examples-v1/multi-codebase-summarization)\n\nNo locked features behind a paywall / commercial / \"pro\" license\n\nIf you find CocoIndex useful, a star on Github means a lot :)\n\n⭐ [https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex)",

      "text": "I've been working on a customer support agent that routes queries to different tools depending on intent. I am essentially building a state-machine style agent using LangGraph, and the state transitions are where the logic keeps drifting. The flow is: classify intent → retrieve relevant docs → generate response → validate output format. Each node works fine in isolation but when the graph runs end to end the failure modes exhibit non-linear behaviors that are hard to replicate. Sometimes the classifier output schema breaks the retriever input, sometimes the context window gets bloated by step 3.\n\nMy current debugging approach is pretty manual. I added verbose logging at each node, dump intermediate state to JSON, and trace back from failures. But the hard part is not finding where it broke, it is understanding why a certain prompt phrasing caused a downstream node to behave differently. LLM outputs are not deterministic so reproducing issues is painful. So I started using Pydantic models for structured output at each step, and let Claude and Beyz coding assistant to help me do sanity check. But it still feels inefficient though. I'm curious how do you test nodes in isolation first or go straight to end-to-end runs? How do you handle the non-determinism problem when debugging state transitions? Is anyone using Pydantic strictly for node-to-node contracts or does the validation overhead add too much latency and retries for production pipelines? ",

      "text": "Every Al project I build ends up repeating the same setup: agent reasoning loop, tool calling, API wrapper, bot integration, deployment configs. After doing this too many times, I built a small internal framework to standardize this stuff for myself.\n\nIt handles things like ReACT-style agents, tool execution, API mode, Discord integration, and edge-friendly deployment patterns.\n\nBefore I invest more time into polishing it, I'm curious how are you handling this today? Are you using LangChain/LangGraph, rolling your own, or something else? What parts feel the most painful to maintain?",

Everyone ends up rebuilding the same \"agent spine\" (loop, tools, retries, logging, auth, deployment) and it gets old fast.\n\nBiggest pain point for me has been eval + observability, like being able to replay a run, inspect tool calls, and measure where the agent went off track. Once you have that, the rest gets way easier to iterate.\n\nIf you are thinking about how to structure the agent loop and what to measure, I have seen a few good writeups here: https://www.agentixlabs.com/blog/\n\nAre you planning to support MCP out of the box, or is it more of an internal tool registry + adapters approach?",
