          "text": "something to clarify, have you trained a model that is approximately 0.125B (125M) parameters? as that's the implication from your statement of 250MB of space. if so, that's a very constrained optimisation space you're working in, and whilst u/SamWest98 is probably correct that using a pre-existing small model would do the trick it is an interesting challenge you've set for yourself.\n\nas to your questions:\n\n1) It probably is a reasonable direction to go, though you'll likely need to specialise the model heavily, as 250MB is tiny. thus, you'll be wanting to focus on summarisation for finetuning. it may be beneficial to use synthetically generated samples for summarisation when you finetune for task as you'll be able to tailor final behaviour more readily that way too.\n\n2) I'd recommend checking out this [article](https://huggingface.co/blog/codelion/optimal-model-architecture). it goes into detail about the hyperparameter optimisation that can be done and some of the interesting things that are noted performance wise in response. if you've done only one training run, then it's probable that the particular combination of layers, embedding dim, etcetera could be optimised. granted, there is also a point where one has to stop and commit to a design. but that is always up to you, as you are the final arbiter of what you're satisfied with. \n\nanyway, good luck! also your English is perfectly fine!",

Depends a lot on your current implenentation though.\n\nIf what you made relies on llama.cpp it will be kinnda tough to turn into an apk, but it can work through Termux. I bring this up becausr from what I understand your intended use case depends on some kind of web-search. So you'd input something like \"quantum tunneling\" and somehow search for results online, pass it to your LLM for summarizing and the outpuy would be an explanation of quantum tunnelibg based on the results. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I assume it to be the case as there is no way a large amount of world knowledge is gonna fit on such a small LLM.\n\nBottomline is the scaffolding around it is as important as the LLM. Also, as cool as Termux is, it's a heek thing and relying om it is going to leave 95% of users out, not a problem if you don't cate abouy massivity though.",

      "text": "Original post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1ky21fy/i_accidentally_built_a_vector_database_using)\n\nSix months ago, I published a weird weekend experiment where I stored text embeddings inside video frames.\n\nI expected maybe 20 people to see it. Instead it got:\n\n* Over 10M views\n* 10k stars on GitHub \n* And thousands of other developers building with it.\n\nOver 1,000 comments came in, some were very harsh, but I also got some genuine feedback. I spoke with many of you and spent the last few months building Memvid v2: it’s faster, smarter, and powerful enough to replace entire RAG stacks.\n\n\n\nThanks for all the support.\n\nPs: I added a little surprise at the end for developers and OSS builders 👇\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Memvid replaces RAG + vector DBs entirely with a single portable memory file.\n* Stores knowledge as Smart Frames (content + embedding + time + relationships)\n* 5 minute setup and zero infrastructure.\n* Hybrid search with sub-5ms retrieval\n* Fully portable and open Source\n\n**What my project does?** Give your AI Agent Memory In One File.\n\n**Target Audience:** Everyone building AI agent.\n\n**GitHub Code:**[ https://github.com/memvid/memvid](https://github.com/memvid/memvid)\n\n—----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Some background:**\n\n* AI memory has been duct-taped together for too long.\n* RAG pipelines keep getting more complex, vector DBs keep getting heavier, and agents still forget everything unless you babysit them. \n* So we built a completely different memory system that replaces RAG and vector databases entirely.  \n\n**What is Memvid:**\n\n* Memvid stores everything your agent knows inside a single portable file, that your code can read, append to, and update across interactions.\n* Each fact, action and interaction is stored as a self‑contained “Smart Frame” containing the original content, its vector embedding, a timestamp and any relevant relationships. \n* This allows Memvid to unify long-term memory and external information retrieval into a single system, enabling deeper, context-aware intelligence across sessions, without juggling multiple dependencies. \n* So when the agent receives a query, Memvid simply activates only the relevant frames, by meaning, keyword, time, or context, and reconstructs the answer instantly.\n* The result is a small, model-agnostic memory file your agent can carry anywhere.  \n\n**What this means for developers:**\n\nMemvid replaces your entire RAG stack.\n\n* Ingest any data type\n* Zero preprocessing required\n* Millisecond retrieval\n* Self-learning through interaction\n* Saves 20+ hours per week\n* Cut infrastructure costs by 90%\n\nJust plug Memvid into your agent and you instantly get a fully functional, persistent memory layer right out of the box.\n\n**Performance & Compatibility**\n\n(tested on my Mac M4)\n\n* Ingestion speed: 157 docs/sec \n* Search Latency: <17ms retrieval for 50,000 documents\n* Retrieval Accuracy: beating leading RAG pipelines by over 60%\n* Compression: up to 15× smaller storage footprint\n* Storage efficiency: store 50,000 docs in a \\~200 MB file\n\nMemvid works with every model and major framework: GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, LangChain, Autogen and custom-built stacks. \n\nYou can also 1-click integrate with your favorite IDE (eg. VS Code, Cursor)\n\nIf your AI agent can read a file or call a function, it can now remember forever.\n\nAnd your memory is 100% portable: Build with GPT → run on Claude → move to Llama. The memory stays identical.\n\n**Bonus for builders**\n\nAlongside Memvid V2, we’re releasing 4 open-source tools, all built on top of Memvid:\n\n* **Memvid ADR** → is an MCP package that captures architectural decisions as they happen during development. When you make high-impact changes (e.g. switching databases, refactoring core services), the decision and its context are automatically recorded instead of getting lost in commit history or chat logs.\n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/adrflow](https://github.com/memvid/adrflow)\n* **Memvid Canvas** →  is a UI framework for building fully-functional AI applications on top of Memvid in minutes. Ship customer facing or internal enterprise agents with zero infra overhead.\n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/canvas](https://github.com/memvid/canvas)\n* **Memvid Mind** → is a persistent memory plugin for coding agents that captures your codebase, errors, and past interactions. Instead of starting from scratch each session, agents can reference your files, previous failures, and full project context, not just chat history. Everything you do during a coding session is automatically stored and ingested as relevant context in future sessions. \n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/memvid-mind](https://github.com/memvid/memvid-mind)\n* **Memvid CommitReel** → is a rewindable timeline for your codebase stored in a single portable file. Run any past moment in isolation, stream logs live, and pinpoint exactly when and why things broke.\n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/commitreel](https://github.com/memvid/commitreel)\n\nAll 100% open-source and available today.\n\nMemvid V2 is the version that finally feels like what AI memory should’ve been all along.\n\nIf any of this sounds useful for what you’re building, I’d love for you to try it and let me know how we can improve it.",

      "text": "I keep seeing the same pattern with enterprise AI agents: they look fine in demos, then break once they’re embedded in real workflows.\n\nThis usually isn’t a model or tooling problem. The agents have access to the right systems, data, and policies.\n\nWhat’s missing is **decision context**.\n\nMost enterprise systems record outcomes, not reasoning. They store that a discount was approved or a ticket was escalated, but not *why* it happened. The context lives in Slack threads, meetings, or individual memory.\n\nI was thinking about this again after reading Jaya Gupta’s article on **context graphs**, which describes the same gap. A context graph treats decisions as first-class data by recording the inputs considered, rules evaluated, exceptions applied, approvals taken, and the final outcome, and linking those traces to entities like accounts, tickets, policies, agents, and humans.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/upw4879w5zag1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=25c8abbab1d6fb2a7cc24e146a8f48524b28b2d0\n\nThis gap is manageable when humans run workflows because people reconstruct context from experience. It becomes a hard limit once agents start acting inside workflows. Without access to prior decision reasoning, agents treat similar cases as unrelated and repeatedly re-solve the same edge cases.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that this isn’t something existing systems of record are positioned to fix. CRMs, ERPs, and warehouses store state before or after decisions, not the decision process itself. Agent orchestration layers, by contrast, sit directly in the execution path and can capture decision traces as they happen.\n\nI wrote a deeper piece exploring why this pushes enterprises toward **context-driven platforms** and what that actually means in practice.

          "text": "Most people think embedding migration means re-embedding everything from scratch. This adapter approach is clever because it sidesteps that entire problem.\n\nThe vector-to-vector mapping is the key insight here. You're not trying to recreate the original text understanding, just translating between learned representations. That's why you can get 93% of OpenAI performance without touching the original documents.\n\nThe domain restriction makes sense too. A general-purpose adapter would probably fail because different models emphasize different semantic features. Training on specific domains lets you learn which features actually matter for that use case.\n\nOne thing to watch out for is drift over time. If your query distribution changes significantly from what the adapter was trained on, that quality score becomes critical. You'll want monitoring around when to fall back to the original embedding model.\n\nThe latency numbers are compelling for high-volume scenarios. 70x speedup means you could handle query spikes without hitting rate limits or burning through API costs. That's especially useful for user-facing search where response time matters.\n\nAre you planning adapters for other model families? The current coverage hits the main commercial providers, but there's probably demand for open-source model bridges too. Something like BGE or Instructor models would round out the ecosystem.\n\nAlso curious about the training data requirements. How much domain-specific data do you need to train a reliable adapter for a new use case?",

And yes, the next version will introduce a pretty wild expansion into other model families and modalities. Learned some pretty interesting things about the shared semantic manifolds between embedding models - submitting some papers about it atm.  The v2 models I'm training are much more advanced but I think even with what's released  people will start to see the value. \n\nCutting even 10% of embedding costs can be huge for companies who do RAG. If you are a startup / represent a company, I have licensable models that are much higher fidelity, can be run locally, are extremely fast, and excel in air-gapped environments.\n\nTrying to get this bird off the ground and genuinely need all the help from the community and anyone else who is able. Please spread the word.  If nothing else please use and enjoy. It really works. It's not a gimic. And the library is open to anyone to add to. I'll be adding scripts in the next version to make training and fine tuning easier and I think answer a lot of these questions.",

Plan mode + plan reviewer sub-agent: Claude thinks before coding, a separate sub-agent with fresh context catches architectural gaps\n2. Coding agent memory: my agent files [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) (like GitHub issues but way better, and live in Git) and works off of them so each session I can just start with \"What's next?\" and my coding agent knows what to work on.\n3. Code reviewer sub-agent: Fresh context window dedicated to catching security holes and edge cases\n4. \"Land the plane\":  One phrase triggers tests, lint, formatting, clean up, commit, push\n\nWhy sub-agents matter:\n\nYour main agent juggles too much -  file contents, conversation history, your requests. Load it with detailed standards and it does a mediocre job at everything.\n\nSub-agents specialize. Each starts fresh, enforces specific standards, returns findings. The plan reviewer knows my architecture patterns. The code reviewer knows my code and security requirements. They catch what the implementation mindset misses.\n\nWhat I'm optimizing for:\n1. Ship fast\n2. No security holes or missed edge cases\n3. Context window stays small (research shows LLM performance degrades past ~40%)\n4. Codebase stays clean as it grows so I can build fast and confidently\n\n[Full writeup with my system prompt, sub agent definitions, and interactive demo](https://willness.dev/blog/claude-code-workflow).",

Instead of replaying transcripts, it stores experiences, facts, and observations separately, then uses reflection to form higher level insights over time. The goal isn’t just recall, but behavior change in long running agents.\n\nI have been exploring it and early benchmarks look promising, but I’m more interested in real world feedback from people building agents outside demos.\n\nDocs:[ https://hindsight.vectorize.io/](https://hindsight.vectorize.io/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)GitHub:[ https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nWould love thoughts from folks working on agent memory, long running workflows, or systems that need consistency over time.\n\n",

          "text": "It depends on how you structure them. Id store the name of the embedding model per collection (if my requirement is to query only one collection at a time) so that i could support multiple embedding models and query them based on the collection's model. I could start using the new model without migrating anything and also would give me a chance to see how better the new model is and assess if it is worth the migration. If the legacy collections could benefit from the new embedding model I'd consider reindexing in phases gradually.\n\nIf the requirement was to query on one global collection, I would create a new collection for the new embedding - > index the content - > do A/B testing - > remove the old collection.\n\nSo it really depends on your product and use-cases. I think the key here is to measure and see if there is any benefit of using the new model before you spend a fortune to reindex the whole content. Another thing is also about not making a change that can break production and planning a smooth transition.",

          "text": "I think you’ll need to slow down, and focus on stabilizing your emotions before you can start making money with AI.\n\nIt’s no shame to fall on hard times. The vast majority of mothers want to support their children - being supported by your mother is the norm in nature, accept it while you need it.\n\nAI is creative work, it is learning work, it is the type of work that becomes 10 times harder the more pressure you put yourself under for it. The more pressure you feel to deliver by next month, the longer it will take you. The fastest path is not to force it, to try to find your interest in it, and grow that interest.\n\nMaking money with AI is complicated, and it won’t be quick - you need to leverage AI with some other skill to make money with it, because people won’t pay for AI they will pay for solutions - so you can enhance the solutions you can offer them, but you still need to know whatever business or skill the solutions exist in. For example, a programmer who knows AI cannot directly leverage it - but a plumber who knows AI can use AI to make more money, faster, at plumbing, by using it to fill their lead pipeline (pun intended) - or a hairdresser can use it to make more money by managing their appointments, etc. \n\nThe money is being paid to people for non-AI products and services - to make money with AI you need to enhance an existing business, help it make more money according to the specific business needs.\n\nSettle in, AI may be a path to change your life, but it will not be next month or even by Spring, you need to stabilize your situation so that you can begin steadily building your skills, trying things and figuring things out - set yourself a more realistic target, that by Jan 1 2027 you have a regular income from AI related work. \n\nThink about what businesses you have around you, what businesses your friends know and work at, what opportunities are there for you to add value with AI. You will need someone to take a chance on you, to spend time letting you discover their business specifics and experimenting with AI to help them, in order to get a track record.\n\nSo relax, breathe - if you need money by next month, it won’t be from AI - to level up in AI and find a source of money from it, you need an open ended exploration, and you need to find opportunities to practice it for others, dealing with real use cases. Start trying to solve problems with AI, using Perplexity to teach you what you need as you go, in relation to the problems you come across. \n\nBest of luck! If you want more specific advice, we’ll need more specifics:\n\n- what education you have / what other work you’ve done - what are your related strengths?\n- any businesses that your family / friends do that they’d be willing to let you look for ways to leverage AI for them\n- any other assets or resources you can leverage here",

Since you have experience in advertising, maybe that will be fastest in companies that are looking for advertising, but I don't think you will be able to charge money for your first few gigs since you also need to learn what you are doing. Once you have a few case studies as an AI consultant, you can start marketing yourself for paid gigs, and push your initial free clients to recommend you.\n\nAs far as assets, you can't leverage the ChatGPT or Gemini subscription to make money (but keep Perplexity - it's a must-have to learn the AI). The 4090 won't help make money either, if it still has most of its resale value, you could safely sell it and not lose any moneymaking ability.  (Local inference doesn't make any money, if the client really won't use the cloud, then they get their own hardware to run the inference - and local inference on that scale doesn't help you either, you should be using SOTA and near-SOTA models in the cloud. E.G. free models on OpenRouter, or super cost efficient plans like GLM coding plan.\n\nI do not think that there is a shortcut to go from 0 experience to making money with AI in < 3 months, that's the fastest I can imagine anyone getting a few free clients, learning what is needed, and getting together a portfolio that can attract paid clients. Most people need more like 6-9 months for this, but maybe if you're super motivated it could be 3 months.",

Businesses need PT-EN content. You already understand the nuance AI misses. Check Upwork/Fiverr for this.\n1. **AI-assisted writing** - Blog posts, product descriptions, social media content. ChatGPT + your human editing = fast output. Start cheap to build reviews, raise prices later.\n1. **Local business outreach** - Small businesses in Brazil probably don’t know AI can help them with customer service scripts, social posts, basic automation. You could be that bridge.\n\nYour hardware is honestly overkill for this kind of work - which is good. You’re not limited.\n\n**One real piece of advice:** Pick ONE direction. Your brain in crisis mode will want to try everything. Don’t. Pick the thing that feels 10% less impossible and do only that for 2 weeks.\n\nHappy to chat more in DMs if you want to talk through specifics.

I can, barely, get Llama running on my 8G macbook air on a quantized Llama model. There are lots of benefits to running locally in addition to costs. \n\n2. Since you are learning, you might want to roll your own small LM. I do experiments with character LMs which run fine and fast on my mac. This is training up a micro sized GPT on something like Shakespeare. You could seek to improve on Kaparthy's work: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ \n\n3. If the requirement is for an application, then I'd suggest NOT doing a direct language interface to the end user. This will allow you to have a \"dumber, e.g. cheaper\" LM and also addresses the many safety issues raised by direct LLM interfaces. \n\n4. For applications I'd suggest something local and small that helps a community or business with some AI smarts. Solving an actual problem will be constrain your app usefully and keep the resulting project relevant to the world. Ideas that I'd like to get around to:\n\nA) A virtual concierge for local motels/airBnB to recommend local activities for obscure attractions in the Catskills NY, USA. \n\nB) Low training data information extraction systems for medical research. \n\nDM me if you want more info or guidance.",

These combinations create ambiguous attention patterns, so the model has less signal to latch onto when predicting the next token. With each token prediction the errors compound since each token depends on previous ones, and eventually the AI starts spouting pseudo-scientific babble. The user, now deeply invested, interprets this as profound insight.\n\nAll those stories of company's chatbots saying horrible things.. this is partially to blame. All your \"Don't say Nazi's are great, please, please don't talk about Nazis\" system prompts don't matter one bit when this happens.. Though you should put a fast classifier (<=500M model) to check these outputs anyway, it's a best practice if you can.\n\nWhen the context is filled with semantically scattered tokens that dilutes attention weights. The model still has to produce something, you get some random token pushed up to the top prediction list and the model doesn't have anything good to choose from. Do that over and over and over again and it will confidently agree that \"Bill Gates does implant AI into people's teeth to force them to get Xbox subscriptions\".\n\nWhen you manage context properly, the same number of tokens actually increase prediction accuracy. That's what thinking models, multi-shot prompting, and in-context learning are doing. Creating focused attention patterns that give the model clear signal to follow.\n\nFocused context = strong attention = confident predictions = fewer hallucinations.\n\nBTW: This is also why codegen AIs tend to make more mistakes until you compress their context.

Functions get split mid-implementation, class definitions get separated from their methods, import statements lose context. Most people chunk by line count or file size and wonder why their retrieval misses obvious dependencies.\n\nThe file selection problem is harder than it looks. You need to understand call graphs, dependency trees, and which files actually relate to the error patterns in the ticket. If you're chunking a React component but missing the hook it depends on, your agents are working with incomplete information.\n\nWhat kills me is how many teams discover their code chunking is broken only after they've already embedded everything. You can't see what went wrong until you're deep into agent conversations getting weird responses about missing imports or incomplete function signatures. I ended up building [VectorFlow](https://vectorflow.dev/?utm_source=redditCP_c) to debug this stuff before it hits the vector store because debugging RAG without seeing your processed code chunks is like coding blindfolded.\n\nWhat's your current thinking on handling cross-file dependencies? Are you planning to chunk at the function level or preserve larger logical units?",

      "text": "Hot take: we've basically cracked agents, context selection, and prompting. The tooling is there. Claude Code, Cursor, etc. all work pretty damn well now. Creating detailed architecture plans and spec-driven stuff with Speckit, OpenSpec, and BMAD with AI is a solved problem at this point.\n\nSo what's next? I think 2026 is gonna be about taking super detailed specs and feeding them into long-running autonomous loops that just keep going until the thing is built.\n\nAnthropic just shipped a Claude Code plugin called ralph-wiggum (named after the Simpsons character lol). It's dumb simple - literally just a while loop that keeps feeding your prompt back to the agent. Claude works on the task, tries to exit, the hook catches it and says nope here's your prompt again, and it keeps going. Each pass sees everything from before - all the file changes, git history, whatever.\n\nThey also put out research on how to get agents working across context windows since they basically get amnesia between sessions. The trick is having the agent leave itself notes - progress files, clean git commits, feature checklists. Next session boots up, reads the notes, picks up where it left off. But honestly the bigger thing here is they gave us the canvas. This is how Anthropic thinks about long-running agents - initializer agents, coding agents, progress artifacts, the whole structure. It's a blueprint.\n\nWith the Claude Agent SDK you can take this pattern and build your own bespoke harnesses for whatever workflow you want. Coding is the obvious one but there's no reason you couldn't spin up custom long-running loops for research, data processing, content pipelines, whatever. Build the harness once, feed it specs, let it grind.\n\nYou combine these things with a really solid spec upfront and suddenly you can just... let it run. Go to bed, wake up, stuff is built. The whole game shifts from prompting in real-time to writing specs that are good enough to survive autonomous execution.\n\nHonestly my main takeaway from all this is we should probably just stick to what the top engineers at Anthropic are doing. There's a million different coding agents and tools and plugins and random github projects out there and it's easy to get lost chasing shiny things. But the people building Claude probably know best how to use Claude. Claude Code + their patterns + maybe the SDK if you need something custom. Keep it simple.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum)\n* [https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13HP\\_bSeNjU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13HP_bSeNjU)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usQ2HBTTWxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usQ2HBTTWxs)",

      "text": "I'd like to share [ai-rulez](https://github.com/Goldziher/ai-rulez). It's a tool for managing and generating rules, skills, subagents, context and similar constructs for AI agents. It supports basically any agent out there because it allows users to control the generated outputs, and it has out-of-the-box presets for all the popular tools (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, Opencode and several others).\n\n## Why?\n\nThis is a valid question. As someone wrote to me on a previous post -- \"this is such a temporary problem\". Well, that's true, I don't expect this problem to last for very long. Heck, I don't even expect such hugely successful tools as Claude Code itself to last very long - technology is moving so fast, this will probably become redundant in a year, or two - or three. Who knows. Still, it's a real problem now - and one I am facing myself. So what's the problem?\n\nYou can create your own .cursor, .claude or .gemini folder, and some of these tools - primarily Claude - even have support for sharing (Claude plugins and marketplaces for example) and composition. The problem really is vendor lock-in. Unlike MCP - which was offered as a standard - AI rules, and now skills, hooks, context management etc. are ad hoc additions by the various manufacturers (yes there is the AGENTS.md initiative but it's far from sufficient), and there isn't any real attempt to make this a standard.\n\nFurthermore, there are actual moves by Anthropic to vendor lock-in. What do I mean? One of my clients is an enterprise. And to work with Claude Code across dozens of teams and domains, they had to create a massive internal infra built around Claude marketplaces. This works -- okish. But it absolutely adds vendor lock-in at present.\n\nI also work with smaller startups, I even lead one myself, where devs use their own preferable tools. I use IntelliJ, Claude Code, Codex and Gemini CLI, others use VSCode, Anti-gravity, Cursor, Windsurf clients. On top of that, I manage a polyrepo setup with many nested repositories. Without a centralized solution, keeping AI configurations synchronized was a nightmare - copy-pasting rules across repos, things drifting out of sync, no single source of truth. I therefore need a single tool that can serve as a source of truth and then .gitignore the artifacts for all the different tools.\n\n## How AI-Rulez works\n\nThe basic flow is: you run `ai-rulez init` to create the folder structure with a `config.yaml` and directories for rules, context, skills, and agents. Then you add your content as markdown files - rules are prescriptive guidelines your AI must follow, context is background information about your project (architecture, stack, conventions), and skills define specialized agent personas for specific tasks (code reviewer, documentation writer, etc.). In `config.yaml` you specify which presets you want - claude, cursor, gemini, copilot, windsurf, codex, etc. - and when you run `ai-rulez generate`, it outputs native config files for each tool.\n\nA few features that make this practical for real teams:\n\nYou can compose configurations from multiple sources via includes - pull in shared rules from a Git repo, a local path, or combine several sources. This is how you share standards across an organization or polyrepo setup without copy-pasting.\n\nFor larger codebases with multiple teams, you can organize rules by domain (backend, frontend, qa) and create profiles that bundle specific domains together. Backend team generates with `--profile backend`, frontend with `--profile frontend`.\n\nThere's a priority system where you can mark rules as critical, high, medium, or low to control ordering and emphasis in the generated output.\n\nThe tool can also run as a server (supports the Model Context Protocol), so you can manage your configuration directly from within Claude or other MCP-aware tools.\n\nIt's written in Go but you can use it via npx, uvx, go run, or brew - installation is straightforward regardless of your stack. It also comes with an MCP server, so agents can interact with it (add, update rules, skill etc.) using MCP. \n\n## Examples\n\nWe use [ai-rulez](https://github.com/Goldziher/ai-rulez) in the [Kreuzberg.dev Github Organization](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev) and the open source repositories underneath it - [Kreuzberg](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg) and [html-to-markdown](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/html-to-markdown) - both of which are polyglot libraries with a lot of moving parts. The rules are shared via git, for example you can see the [config.yaml](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/html-to-markdown/blob/main/.ai-rulez/config.yaml) file in the html-to-markdown .ai-rulez folder, showing how the rules module is read from GitHub. The `includes` key is an array, you can install from git and local sources, and multiple of them - it scales well, and it supports SSH and bearer tokens as well.\n\nAt any rate, this is the [shared rules](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/ai-rulez) repository itself - you can see how the [data is organized under a .ai-rulez folder](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/ai-rulez/tree/main/.ai-rulez), and you can see how some of the data is split among [domains](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/ai-rulez/tree/main/.ai-rulez/domains).\n\nWhat do the generated files look like? Well, they're native config files for each tool - CLAUDE.md for Claude, .cursorrules for Cursor, .continuerules for Continue, etc. Each preset generates exactly what that tool expects, with all your rules, context, and skills properly formatted.\n",

As the models got better, I have used it extensively in the last year for doing data enrichment by writing Python scripts that loop through a dataset ... and basically reproduce the same effect of prompting one-off on ChatGPT.\n\nI was surpirsed no one built a good tool to scale a prompt on every record of a dataset. Google Sheets tried but wasn't the best implementation. So, all these months, I have been saving Python scripts in notebooks and copying one notebook to another whenever I have a new data enrichment exercise.\n\nLLMs are so good for structuring unstructured data. So, I saw this as an opportunity to make my life better. And, taking inspiration from the heydays of [CodePen](https://codepen.io/trending) and [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), I figured I will create my own tool: [LLM Fiddle](https://llmfiddle.io/).\n\nIf this resonates, please give it a try and let me know what you think.

      "text": "Hello,\n\nI use AI heavily.  Aside from automation, tooling, agentic workflows, and ComfyUI, I also spend a lot of time talking with the LLMs.  Mostly about technical stuff.  So, when I have an idea that I want to share and write a post to a forum or whatnot, I find that, for example, ChatGPT, is superior to spell/grammar check in every way.  Not only can it check spelling and grammar, but it can also refactor phrases that were originally worded in a less-than-optimal manner.  It's also great for automatically adding formatting to plaintext, making it easier to read and gives it a more organized look. It's also great at finding the words to explain technical things, and posts made with its help look much better.\n\nHowever, whenever I try to post such content, I often get flamed and accused of using AI to create the entirety of the content, despite the fact that the content itself contains ideas that AI couldn't come up with on its own (and to make sure of that, I tried.  Hard). And such cases are kinda obvious too.  It doesn't take much to discern between 'AI creativity' and prompt-managed writing whose ideas come from the human operator.  Hell, sometimes I even get accused of using AI when I haven't at all, and have manually typed up the entire thing (such as this post).  So what's the deal with this?\n\nAI is a tool, and a powerful one at that, and like any tool, it can be used properly or abused.  However, it seems that if there's even a hint of AI-generated content in a post, many people seem to assume that AI was misused - that the entire thing was lazily created with a single prompt, or something like that.  Now, I AM aware that a lot of people do use AI lazily and inappropriately when it comes to writing.  But why is that a reason for people to assume that EVERYONE does it this way?\n\nEven when I have AI write for me, the writing is typically the result of dozens of prompts and hours of work, in which I go over every section and every detail of what's being written.  In such cases, it's more of a 'write director' than 'typist' or 'just have AI do it all for me'.  I asked AI what this type of writing is called, and it gave me identifiers such as \"AI-assisted writing\", \"iterative prompt steering\", \"augmented authorship\", \"editorial control\", and \"human-in-the-loop authorship\".\n\nDespite the fact that there are appropriate uses for AI in writing, it seems that people assume the opposite. Is the use of AI in writing universally considered unacceptable?  It's kinda sad and simultaneously infuriating that the majority of people hate on AI without understanding what it is or how it works, and the people that DO know how to use it appropriately and effectively get called out as if they're part of the problem.  What gives?  Is this going to be the fact of reality for a long time?  Does anyone else here encounter this situation?",

          "text": "Sure, let's delve into that.\n\n**People crave authenticity.** We're here to talk with each other—not with a robot. The internet is full of slop. Given something that *looks* like AI, people will assume that it *is* AI. The result: silence, downvotes and flaming.\n\nYou say that it's easy to distinguish. In my experience, that's not the case. It can be difficult to detect whether something was written with AI. And when something was written with AI, whether it contains original thoughts. That “shoot the messenger” attitude might have a few false positives, but it works more often than it fails. Heuristics like this are necessary to navigate today's social media landscape with all its sensory overload. Unless your readers already know you, you will not be given the benefit of a doubt.\n\nHere's what you can do about that:\n\n* **Use your own authentic voice.** Stop worrying about perfect phrases, perfect spelling, and perfect formatting—using your own voice shows that you care.\n* **Learn simple writing strategies.** You're spending hours crafting prompts. You could spend that time editing your writing directly. Perhaps all that's missing is the *confidence* to do it yourself.\n* **Go deep.** A lot of LLM outputs are generic and superficial. Be an expert. Talk from your personal experience. Provide sources.\n\n---\n\nThis post is a parody of LLM style. I don't use GenAI for writing, but my natural online writing style is sometimes considered LLM-ish – even though I've been writing that way online for a decade longer than ChatGPT exists.",

We think in language, loading in a ton of language simulacrum - of meaningless (at best) patter, cannot be good for us. It’s the equivalent of LLM training data, for the human - you don’t want your training data (everything you perceive) to get too low of a quality or else GIGO will apply to your own brain…\n\nSo as long as there’s plenty of posts that sound authentic from the outset, I see no need to wade into the ones that sound inauthentic from the outset. If you want more readership, maybe you should focus on making your posts more appealing from the outset. If people are critiquing your posts for AI writing style, maybe… if those people are your audience…. listen to them?\n\nOr don’t, it doesn’t matter, this is Reddit, nobody’s entitled to readership - it’s all a zero sum competition for attention out here.",
