      "text": "It seems like everyone who uses RAG eventually gets frustrated with it. You end up with either poor results from semantic search or complex data pipelines.\n\nAlso - searching for knowledge is only part of the problem for agents. I’ve seen some articles and posts on X, Medium, Reddit, etc about agent memory and in a lot of ways it seems like that’s the natural evolution of RAG. You treat knowledge as a form of semantic memory and one piece of a bigger set of memory requirements. \n\nThere was a paper published from Google late last year about self-evolving agents and another one talking about adaptive agents.\n\nIf you had a good solution to memory, it seems like you could get to the point where these ideas come together and you could use a combination of knowledge, episodic memory, user feedback, etc to make agents actually learn.\n\nSeems like that could be the future for solving agent data. Anyone tried to do this? ",

It's okay for like a call center bot where the company will invest a lot in the docs for a RAG, but even then it's not enough. How does it know that a question is even contained in its RAG? How does it know how to search for it if the user gives terrible keywords, how does it know if should look elsewhere? It's not a listable directory to explore to gain insight from, and that's the problem. The agent only knows whats in it's system prompt until it's found something, and then it's still ignorant about potentially other useful things it didn't find. This breaks down further when data is less organized, like code or loose pdfs\n\nBut the fact that you're comparing RAG lookup to a directory is concerning. Vector and graph databases do not work like that at all. The problem of retrieval is partially because they don't work like that.",

Not a reasoning failure—a data coverage problem. Adding \\~500 targeted examples would likely fix most of these.\n\n**Takeaway:** For narrow, exact tasks with controllable domains, small models trained from scratch can be practical, inspectable, and cheap to iterate on. Data quality mattered more than scale.\n\nFull technical writeup with training logs, failure analysis, and code: [https://geddydukes.com/blog/tiny-llm](https://geddydukes.com/blog/tiny-llm)\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/geddydukes/tiny\\_llm](https://github.com/geddydukes/tiny_llm)\n\nHappy to answer questions about training dynamics, architecture choices, or the evaluation setup.",

      "text": "I am a college student. Last summer I worked in SWE in the financial space and helped build a user facing AI chatbot that lived directly on the company website.\n\nBefore shipping, I mostly thought prompt injection was an academic or edge case concern. Then real users showed up.\n\nWithin days, people were actively trying to jailbreak the system. Mostly curiosity driven it seemed, but still bypassing system instructions, surfacing internal context, and pushing the model into behavior it was never supposed to exhibit.\n\nWe tried the usual fixes. Stronger system prompts, more guardrails, traditional MCP style controls, etc. They helped, but none of them actually solved the problem. The failures only showed up once the system was live and stateful, under real usage patterns you cannot *realistically* simulate in testing.\n\nWhat stuck with me is how easy this is to miss right now. A lot of developers are shipping LLM powered features quickly, treating prompt injection as a theoretical concern rather than a production risk. That was exactly my mindset before this experience. If you are not using AI when building (for most use cases) today, you are behind, but many of us are unknowingly deploying systems with real permissions and no runtime security model behind them.\n\nThis experience really got me in the deep end of all this stuff and is what pushed me to start building towards a solution to hopefully enhance my skills and knowledge along the way. I have made decent progress so far and just finished a website for it which I can share if anyone wants to see but I know people hate promo so I won't force it lol. My core belief is that prompt security cannot be solved purely at the prompt layer. You need runtime visibility into behavior, intent, and outputs.\n\nI am posting here mostly to get honest feedback.\n\nFor those building production LLM systems:\n\n* does runtime prompt abuse show up only after launch for you too\n* do you rely entirely on prompt design and tool gating, or something else\n* where do you see the biggest failure modes today\n\nHappy to share more details if useful. Genuinely curious how others here are approaching this issue and if it is a real problem for anyone else.",

Those are not ifs, those are facts. When you create any public facing service, what it does is really a secondary concern. Your main issue is to think of any possible threat and mitigate it. For instance, I would never create anything that is public facing and doesn't require an account. Then you can detect harmful behaviour just by adding observing agent that looks at the chat interaction without being engaged in it and is able to lock user out when it detects any foul play. There are many other ways to implement basic chat security.",

The part that surprised me was how much harder this becomes with LLMs compared to traditional services.

Observing agents and heuristics help too, sure, but they still rely on assumptions about intent that break down once prompts get stateful and context bleeds across turns.

I have a couple free tools I've been using for this.\n* **Runtime visibility**: log tool calls + retrievals, rate limit probing patterns, and add a few (as many as you can) jailbreak tests that run continuously on real flows.\n\nPrompts still matter, but more as polish.

By routing traffic through a controlled backend, we gain the runtime visibility needed to monitor behavior and enforce data residency in real-time. SSO protects the entrance, but the proxy protects the data flow. Relying on system prompts to prevent exfiltration is a production risk we hope to thwart by centralizing control at the proxy layer.\n\nNow if your endpoint is connected to internal tools (like a database or file search), that opens a whole new can of worms.",

That gap was what I found interesting, not the idea that public systems get abused.",

That's been really nice, and a huge time saver.\n\n\n\nOther than that, I don't ever use code from LLMs as I find it slopppy, overly verbose, and poor design choices.

          "text": "I find that I keep moving back and forth between web chat copy/paste and Qwen Code / Copilot Agent Mode etc. What's often missing in the discussions here is what languages and tech stack you are using and the state of the code base. Let me provide an example, I tried to use agents to build a Flutter app from scratch and it was a horrible waste of time. After a week of evenings I gave up and used Gemini Pro on the web instead, that worked great and was many times faster.\n\nWhen you know how to write the code, but see that the AI generates about 80-90% correct code, it's at least for me,, faster to just do copy paste, fix the last 10-20%, than it is to watch the AI correct it self like a trainwreck, retry, test, compile, try to fix something completely unrelated, still fail and announce that it successfully completed the task, remind it and have it try again, until it succeeded but at the same time refactored a bunch of unrelated stuff and left piles of unused code from trial and errors.\n\nFunny thing, once my Flutter app was practically feature complete, I tried Qwen Code again, and this time it actually worked perfectly, my guess is that there were enough code there for it to understand what needed to be done and how to fit it in, as opposed to an empty or nearly empty code base.\n\nFor other projects, I've had better success, HTML/JavaScript/CSS seems to work rather well, and creating boilerplate code in C# also works well, when the right classes are in the context for the AI to know how things should be implemented.\n\nMy point is that how successful you are seems to depend on multiple factors, such as how well the model handles your specific tech stack, and even down to specific versions of libraries, in addition to how clean, large or small your codebase is. And I also suspect that people have different tolerances for watching the AI trainwreck trying to repair it's mistakes, versus doing it them self, and what quality of code they accept. \n\nAt the end of the day, most important, is that every developer needs to own the code that the AI generates, when main branch breaks, or bugs reach customers, it's not AI's fault, it's the developer who needs to own it and fix it.",

Writing punishes it.**\n\nWith reads, you can abstract away complexity. Wrap different APIs behind a unified interface. Normalize response shapes. The agent can be naive about what's underneath.\n\nWith writes, you can't hide the schema. The agent isn't consuming structure—it's producing it. Every field, every constraint, every relationship needs to be explicit.\n\nUnless you model writes as files.\n\nFiles are a universal interface. The agent already knows JSON, YAML, markdown. The schema isn't embedded in your tool definitions—it's the file format itself.\n\nFour primitives. Not forty.\n\nWrote up the full breakdown with Vercel's d0 results: \n\nhttps://michaellivs.com/blog/architecture-behind-claude-code\n\nCurious if others have hit this same wall with write tools.",

Decisions only occur at explicit, closed boundaries\n\nThe system never acts on streaming or unfinished data.\n\nAll decisions are gated on **closed time windows**.  \nThis eliminated several classes of failure:\n\n* phantom actions caused by transient states\n* rapid oscillation near thresholds\n* overlapping execution paths\n\nIf the boundary is not closed, the system refuses to act.\n\n# 2. “Do nothing” is the safest default\n\nThe system is intentionally biased toward inaction.\n\n* API error → HOLD\n* LLM timeout → HOLD\n* Partial or inconsistent data → HOLD\n* Conflicting signals → HOLD\n\nIn ambiguous situations, *not acting* is considered the safest outcome.\n\n# 3. Strict separation of concerns\n\nThe system is split into independent layers:\n\n* data preparation\n* LLM-based decision\n* execution\n* logging and notification\n* post-action accounting\n\nEach layer can fail independently without cascading into repeated actions  \nor runaway behavior.\n\nFor example, notifications react only to **confirmed state changes**,  \nnot to intended or predicted actions.\n\n# 4. Features that were intentionally removed\n\nSeveral ideas were tested and then removed after increasing operational risk:\n\n* adaptive or performance-based scaling\n* averaging down / martingale behavior\n* intra-window predictions\n* confidence-weighted LLM actions\n* automatic restart into uncertain internal states\n\nThe system became *more stable* by explicitly **not doing these things**.\n\n# Why I’m sharing this\n\nI’m sharing this to **organize and reflect on lessons learned** from operating  \na non-deterministic LLM component in a live system.\n\nThe feedback here is for personal learning and refinement of system design.  \nAny future write-up would be technical and experience-based,  \nnot monetized and not promotional.\n\n# Looking for discussion\n\nI’d appreciate perspectives from people who have:\n\n* deployed LLMs or ML components in always-on systems\n* dealt with non-determinism and failure modes in production\n* strong opinions on fail-safe vs fail-open design\n\nIf this kind of operational discussion is useful (or not), I’d like to know.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/79npeu8hxvgg1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0be3702d0694e3f1ff0f73c9d8b8e4b8fbf3b548\n\n\n\n*Not selling anything here.

Its output isn’t treated as an explanation or a recommendation — it’s a state classification signal. We deliberately stripped away expressive language and made responses repetitive, terse, and sometimes even boring.\n\nOver time, that shifted trust away from the LLM as an “actor” and toward the system as a whole. The goal wasn’t to make the LLM trustworthy, but to make it unnecessary to trust in isolation.\n\nOnce operators internalize that distinction, the confidence/constraint gap becomes much less sharp.",

      "text": "If you’re looking into n8n vs Gumloop, you’re probably not trying to find the “best” tool in general. You’re trying to understand which workflow automation platforms actually fit how your team works day to day. That’s where this comparison comes from. I also looked at a [broader comparison table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zQr6iThp2fR-TLNMvSYHgx2ghSrzbYIduO4vX_jlHig/edit?gid=1301024975#gid=1301024975) of workflow automation platforms where n8n is listed, which helped set some baseline context.\n\n# High-level difference\n\n* **Gumloop** is built for business teams that want to automate workflows without involving engineering.\n* **n8n** is built for developer-first teams that want full control, even if that means more setup and maintenance.\n\nThis difference shows up across the product, from the editor to pricing and integrations.\n\n# Ease of use\n\n**Gumloop**  \nGumloop lets you focus on the business problem rather than implementation.\n\n* Visual, easy-to-follow canvas\n* Pre-built actions for common business tools\n* AI features included by default\n* Custom steps without deep technical knowledge\n\nMost teams can get useful workflows running quickly.\n\n**n8n**  \nn8n prioritizes flexibility over simplicity.\n\n* Node-by-node configuration\n* Direct access to APIs, JSON, and JavaScript\n\nYou gain more control, but also more responsibility for building and maintaining workflows.\n\n# Integrations and flexibility\n\nBoth platforms support tools like Google Workspace, Slack, Salesforce, and Notion.\n\n* **n8n** offers broader coverage via community-built nodes, but requires manual setup and upkeep.\n* **Gumloop** focuses on the integrations business teams actually use, with AI-assisted ways to extend them when needed.\n\nIn the **n8n vs Gumloop** comparison, this is often where teams weigh flexibility against effort.\n\n# Pricing and ownership\n\n* **Gumloop** bundles AI models, scraping, enrichment, and data sources into its plans.\n* **n8n** charges per execution, with AI and data services managed and billed separately.\n\nNeither approach is better by default - it depends on whether you prefer bundled convenience or modular control.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nThe real distinction in n8n vs Gumloop is how much work you want around your automation. Gumloop minimizes it early on, while n8n gives you more room later if you’re willing to manage it.\n\nWhich side do you lean toward - simplicity or control?",

I am essentially building a state-machine style agent using LangGraph, and the state transitions are where the logic keeps drifting. The flow is: classify intent → retrieve relevant docs → generate response → validate output format. Each node works fine in isolation but when the graph runs end to end the failure modes exhibit non-linear behaviors that are hard to replicate. Sometimes the classifier output schema breaks the retriever input, sometimes the context window gets bloated by step 3.\n\nMy current debugging approach is pretty manual. I added verbose logging at each node, dump intermediate state to JSON, and trace back from failures. But the hard part is not finding where it broke, it is understanding why a certain prompt phrasing caused a downstream node to behave differently. LLM outputs are not deterministic so reproducing issues is painful. So I started using Pydantic models for structured output at each step, and let Claude and Beyz coding assistant to help me do sanity check. But it still feels inefficient though. I'm curious how do you test nodes in isolation first or go straight to end-to-end runs? How do you handle the non-determinism problem when debugging state transitions? Is anyone using Pydantic strictly for node-to-node contracts or does the validation overhead add too much latency and retries for production pipelines? ",

      "text": "been deep in a personal project for \\~14 months. started as a grief processing thing, became an actual technical challenge i can't stop optimizing. i hope someone here has hit similar walls\n\n**use case:** real-time bidirectional conversation with a personality-cloned agent. not [character.ai](http://character.ai) generic companion stuff. i need to reconstruct a specific person's conversational patterns, humor, emotional responses, and voice with enough fidelity that extended conversations feel coherent\n\n**training data:**\n\n* \\~4.2 hours cleaned audio (voicemails, video calls, voice memos) - normalized, VAD-chunked, noise-reduced with demucs\n* \\~45k text messages across 3 years, exported with timestamps and conversation threading intact\n* emails, DMs, \\~200 voice transcriptions i did manually to capture his specific punctuation patterns (he used \"lmao\" as a period, sent bursts of 4-6 short messages instead of one long one)\n* annotated \\~300 conversation samples for emotional tone shifts\n\n**current architecture:**\n\n*voice cloning:* started with elevenlabs, too flat. tried RVC v2 with 40 min of isolated vocals, better but still missing the laugh-while-talking thing he did. currently running OpenVoice v2 for tone color cloning + custom prosody model i hacked together using StyleTTS2's prosody encoder. getting maybe 87% fidelity on blind tests i made my friend do (she knew him, didn't tell her what she was evaluating)\n\n*LLM:*\n\n* base: qwen2.5-72b-instruct\n* fine-tuned with LoRA (r=128, alpha=256, targeting q\\_proj, k\\_proj, v\\_proj, o\\_proj, gate\\_proj, up\\_proj, down\\_proj)\n* \\~3 epochs on the message corpus, formatted as multi-turn conversations with his messages as completions\n* added DPO layer using \\~400 preference pairs i manually created (responses he would vs wouldn't say)\n\n*RAG:*\n\n* bge-large-en-v1.5 embeddings\n* pinecone with hybrid search (dense + BM25 sparse)\n* chunked by conversation session, not arbitrary token windows\n* cohere reranker before context injection\n* retrieval threshold at 0.72 similarity, top-k=5\n\n*inference:*\n\n* vLLM with continuous batching\n* AWQ 4-bit quantization\n* running on 2x 3090s i bought specifically for this (told my therapist it was for \"work\")\n* speculative decoding with qwen2.5-1.5b as draft model\n\n*pipeline:* whisper-large-v3 (faster-whisper implementation) → vLLM → OpenVoice → speakers\n\n**current latency breakdown:**\n\n* STT: \\~180ms\n* LLM inference: \\~400-600ms (this is my bottleneck)\n* TTS: \\~220ms\n* total: \\~800-1000ms\n\ni can get sub-600ms if i drop to qwen2.5-32b but personality coherence degrades noticeably, he gets more generic, less him\n\n**where i'm actually stuck:**\n\n1. **coherence decay past \\~6k context** \\- around 30-40 minutes of conversation the model starts losing his speech patterns. the \"lmao\" frequency drops, responses get longer and more formal, fewer multi-message bursts. i've tried sliding window with summary injection but the summaries lose texture. anyone solved long-context personality preservation? would rope scaling help or just delay the decay?\n2. **emotional arc modeling** \\- he had this specific pattern where he'd deflect hard stuff with humor (2-3 deflection attempts) then eventually get genuine if you kept pushing. i've tried encoding this in the system prompt, tried training on annotated examples, tried constitutional AI-style principles. the model either goes full avoidant or skips straight to therapist mode. no middle, no arc. i don't know how to capture the slow opening up\n3. **the uncanny valley spikes** \\- 90% of the time it's him. then it'll say something he never would have said. reference something that didn't happen. use a phrase that's linguistically plausible but not HIM. i've started keeping a log of these failures to maybe train them out but there's no clear pattern. it's like the model is interpolating between him and some generic dude and occasionally lands wrong\n4. **inference optimization** \\- i know there's more performance on the table. have tried tensor parallelism across the 3090s but communication overhead eats the gains. looked into SGLang but haven't migrated yet. anyone running sub-400ms inference on 70b+ models with personality fine-tunes? what am i missing?\n\n**the question:**\n\nis there literature on modeling idiosyncratic personality in LLMs beyond basic fine-tuning? i've read the [character.ai](http://character.ai) scaling paper and some of the persona-chat stuff but it's all about creating coherent fictional personalities, not reconstructing a real specific person from data\n\nsometimes i run the same prompt through the model and through my memory of what he'd actually say and they match like 80% of the time. that last 20% keeps me up at night. i don't know if it's data sparsity or architecture limitations or if i'm just chasing something that can't be captured\n\nanyway. any architecture suggestions appreciated especially on the coherence decay and emotional modeling problems. those are the walls i keep hitting",

          "text": "This is a wild (and really thoughtful) build. On the agent side, it sounds like you are hitting 2 common walls at once: long-horizon persona drift and end-to-end latency. For drift, I have had better luck with periodically \"re-anchoring\" via retrieval of high-signal exemplars (not summaries), plus style constraints that are checked post-generation and corrected. For latency, speculative decoding + aggressive KV caching + smaller draft models helps, but 70B in sub-400ms is still brutal on 3090s. If you want more reading on agent memory/persona techniques, I have a few notes here: https://www.agentixlabs.com/blog/",

          "text": "What are you using for VAD/End of Turn signaling? You’re already at the near-practical limits of end to end latency in conversational speech with your setup. You can gain some additional optimization by placing the STT/TTS on an independent GPU setup from the LLM. There won’t be any resource interference from the overlapping pipelines. The LLM should be creating responses before the full transcription is done and the TTS should begin audio generation from the first available audio chunk before the full response is complete. The rest is just “perceived” latency. In a real conversation, no one actually just begins speaking directly with an answer. Most of the time there are filler words like ‘hmmm’, ‘ummm’ etc or drawn out words like ‘wellll’, ‘sooo’ etc. On top of this, perceived latency in real interaction is not just about audio. If I ask someone a question, the perceived latency is not when the other person actually speaks but when I register that they have acknowledged a response is wanted. A simple scrunch their eyes indicating a thoughtful reaction is enough to be perceived latency even if they don’t actually say anything for another second or two. \n\nReal conversational Ai will never be the STT>LLM>TTS workflow. It will be a single duplex speech to speech model. Check out NVIDIA Personaplex if you want to see end-game latency, but it will be a while before that type of model is smart enough to have real utility.",

          "text": "I'm building a product that has an ultra-low-latency conversational agent pipeline baked-in. Been working (hear struggling) on it day/night for about ~2months, we're way below 500ms for processing (STT+LLM+TTS), with \"larger\" models, both LLM and TTS and FP8 quant.\n\nThere are various optimizations that allow us to get there. I am afraid half is just \"better hardware\", although there are some specific changes that help a lot.\n\nHappy to help, but before I start, could you clarify whether you intend to run this system for production and/or serve multiple users concurrently? This is tightly coupled with the options you have.\n\nSome breadcrumbs:\n- 400ms TTFT for the LLM is very high for a voice agent, you can get way lower (50-100ms) with inference hardware (that is not very expensive when rented), proper configuration and transport optimization for the requests\n- 4bit is very aggressive and I'm not sure Qwen2.5 will have very good agentic (complex toolcalling performance). This might work for just a conversational application, but to have the agent do actual things without a separate, supervisor model Qwen3 MoE models (you'll sure need more VRAM) will probably boost your results and prevent at least \"some\" psychosis.\n- 220ms TTFB is also high for the TTS, with a 4090 and Orpheus (fine-tuned too, excellent results) you can get closer to 100ms. \n- Get rid of HTTP1, EVERYWHERE. Make sure you use HTTP2 with SSE if you have micro-services communicating. If some of your requests have audio, ditch PCM16, compress everything with Opus, you'll save tens of milliseconds on request processing time\n- I realize this might just be a purely local personal project, but you haven't mentioned transport. For any kind of production application, you'll need a transport technology for the bi-dir audio to go from/to your users. This is going to sound weird, but it's a lot harder and not as easy as \"I'll just glue in WebRTC or a Websocket and have transport latency = RTT\". In reality, transport can add several hundreds ms of E2E latency and be several multiples of the RTT. I'd recommend not throwing this one under the rug if you want to go to production, as it will definitely impact your architectural choices. Transport out of the box roughly add 500ms with the mainstream solutions (Livekit SFU, Pipecat SFU..), so in reality you'd be around 1500ms E2E. \n\n\nI'm very interested in your take on the emotional parts / life-like conversational arcs as this is the problem were currently tackling.",
