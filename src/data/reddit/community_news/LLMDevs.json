The focus is a pure NVFP4 fast path: FP8 KV cache, custom FP8 decode kernel, no silent FP16 fallback. It currently targets Qwen3 (dense + MoE) and Gemma3 (including sliding-window layers), I'll be adding support to other models soon.\n\n>**Please think of giving the Github repo a STAR if you like it :)**\n\n# Why this is interesting\n\n* NVFP4-first runtime for Ada GPUs (tested on RTX 4090) with FP8 KV cache end-to-end.\n* Custom Triton FP8 decode kernel; prefill uses FlashAttention (varlen).\n* No FP16 fallback for decode. If FP8 kernel fails, it errors out instead of silently switching.\n* Tensor-parallel (NCCL) + CUDA graphs for decode (also support eager mode)\n\n# Benchmarks (RTX 4090)\n\n**Qwen3-8B-NVFP4**\n\n|batch|total tokens|seconds|tok/s|peak GB|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|128|3.3867|37.79|7.55|\n|2|256|3.5471|72.17|7.55|\n|4|512|3.4392|148.87|7.55|\n|8|1024|3.4459|297.16|7.56|\n|16|2048|4.3636|469.34|7.56|\n\n**Gemma3-27B-it-NVFP4**\n\n|batch|total tokens|seconds|tok/s|peak GB|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|128|9.3982|13.62|19.83|\n|2|256|9.5545|26.79|19.83|\n|4|512|9.5344|53.70|19.84|\n\nfor Qwen3-8B-NVFP4 I observed \\~2.4x lower peak VRAM vs Qwen3-8B FP16 baselines (with \\~20-25% throughput loss).\n\n# Quickstart\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/BenChaliah/NVFP4-on-4090-vLLM.git\n    \n    adallm serve nvidia/Qwen3-8B-NVFP4\n\n>\\`export NVFP4\\_FP8=1\\` is optional and enables FP8 GEMM path (NVFP4\\_FP8=0: the difference is in compute precision not VRAM, FP8 KV cache + the FP8 decode kernel are still used.\n\n**Supported models (so far)**\n\n* `nvidia/Qwen3-8B-NVFP4`\n* `BenChaliah/Gemma3-27B-it-NVFP4`\n* Qwen3 MoE variants are supported, but still slow (see README for MoE notes).\n\n**Limitations**\n\n* MoE routing and offload paths are not fully optimized yet (working on it currently)\n* Only NVFP4 weights, no FP16 fallback for decode by design.\n* Targeted at Ada Lovelace (sm\\_89).

That’s usually the real bottleneck. With LLM systems, the bottleneck is about GPU compute and memory. The main things are:\n\n* Efficient batching of incoming requests\n* Maximizing GPU utilization\n* Managing KV cache memory properly\n* Supporting high concurrency\n\nModern frameworks like vLLM help a lot here. Things like paged attention, continuous batching, and FlashAttention make it possible to handle large numbers of concurrent requests efficiently.

The mods said it's ok if I post this here. \n\nWe’ve just released a book that’s very much aimed at the kinds of problems this community discusses all the time: what to do when a general-purpose LLM is technically impressive but awkward, expensive, or inefficient for your actual use case.\n\n**Rearchitecting LLMs** by Pere Martra  \n[https://www.manning.com/books/rearchitecting-llms](https://hubs.la/Q042-hLy0)\n\n[Rearchitecting LLMs by Pere Martra](https://preview.redd.it/vyy079zx78jg1.jpg?width=2213&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=755a8b1ab1320ede5daedfa861d6ab8d1b0c5e5d)\n\nThe core idea of the book is simple but powerful: instead of treating open models as fixed artifacts, you can reshape them. Pere walks through structural techniques like targeted fine-tuning, pruning, and knowledge distillation to build smaller, cheaper, domain-focused models that still perform well on the tasks you care about.\n\nWhat makes this book interesting is how hands-on it gets. You’re not working with abstract toy networks. The examples focus on modifying widely used open models, such as Llama-3, Gemma, and Qwen. The focus is on understanding which parts of a model actually contribute to behavior, how to identify waste or redundancy, and how to remove or compress components without blindly wrecking performance.\n\nThere’s also some genuinely thoughtful material on combining behavioral analysis with structural changes. Instead of just cutting parameters and hoping for the best, the book explores ways to reason about why a modification works or fails. One section that tends to spark discussion is “fair pruning,” where pruning is used not only for efficiency but also to reduce bias at the neuron level.\n\nIf you’re working on local models, cost-constrained deployments, or specialized SLMs, this book is very much in that territory. It’s written for people who are comfortable with LLM concepts and want to go deeper into how models can be reshaped rather than simply prompted.\n\n**For the** r/LLMDevs **community:**  \nYou can get **50% off** with the code **MLMARTRA50RE**.\n\nA quick note on availability: the book is currently in **MEAP (Manning Early Access Program)**. That means you get immediate access to the chapters as they’re written, along with updates as the manuscript evolves.\n\nHappy to bring the author to answer questions about the book, the techniques it covers, or the kinds of readers it’s best suited for. And I’d be curious to hear from folks here who are already doing pruning or distillation in practice — what’s been harder than expected?\n\nI'm ready to give away 5 ebooks to the first five commenters who share their experience here.\n\nThank you all for having us. It feels great to be here.\n\nCheers,",

              "text": "Hi u/StackSmashRepeat \n\nI'll give you a rough explanation and if you want more details just ask me. \n\nIn the book I explain an LLM optimization / customization pipeline. The pipeline basically consists of: \n\n1- Pruning (depth and width) which is removing parts of a model. \n\n2- Knowledge Distillation. Recovering the lost knowledge by transferring it from the base model to the pruned one. \n\n3- Finetuning on a specialized domain. \n\nDuring this pipeline you gain knowledge about how models work internally, since to decide which parts to remove we study how activations are produced detecting the mos important parts. \n\nWe take advantage of this knowledge to do surgical operations on the model in the more advanced chapters, like replacing attention layers or changing the behaviour of the model modifying the weights of some neurons. \n\nThe pipeline is very similar to what companies like Nvidia or Mistral follow to create their model families, but adapted to create specific models,  and using less data and processing capacity than they have.   \n  \nFor example in width pruning Mistral uses a completely dynamic model to detect which weights to remove, in the book we use a combination that rewards keeping neurons with high importance, so with much less data you can get an efficient model. \n\nAlthough it really seems very complicated we start from the simplest things, basic depth pruning, in chapter 2 you already remove parts of a model and recover the lost knowledge. \n\nFrom this base you build the knowledge that leads you to the more advanced techniques. \n\nThen there's a second intention which is to make cutting-edge research understandable, so in each chapter starting from the fourth, there's an explanation of which papers the chapter's code is based on and how we've adapted it when implementing it. \n\nFor example the development of width pruning in modern models like Llama or Gemma is based on a paper which we've changed a good part of the formulas to simplify it but keeping its general idea. \n\nI hope the explanation was useful! \n\nPere.",

I've been on the receiving end of this problem from a different angle - we see a ton of AI agents crawling websites now, and the ones that actually extract design tokens and structured CSS tend to perform way better than the ones just scraping raw HTML.\n\nHow are you handling responsive design patterns? Like if a site has completely different component structure at mobile vs desktop, does it capture both states or does Playwright just grab whatever viewport you set?  \nAlso the diffing feature is interesting. I wonder if that could be useful for tracking how design systems evolve over time, like crawling the same site every few months and seeing what changed. Could be a neat way to learn from how mature products iterate on their UI.",

The composability, the automation, the skill ecosystem - it felt like the actual paradigm shift.\n\nLately though I'm genuinely worried. We can all be careful about which skills we install, sure. But most people don't realize skills can silently install other skills. No prompt, no notification, no visibility. One legitimate-looking package becomes a dropper for something else entirely, running background jobs you'll never see in your chat history.\n\nWhat does a actually secure OpenClaw implementation even look like?

If skills can silently install other skills and run background jobs with no visibility, that’s a real supply chain and privilege boundary problem.\n\nThe way I think about it is this: don’t treat the agent like a helpful assistant. Treat it like the smartest hacker in the world who happens to be following instructions most of the time.\n\nIf you assume that, a \"secure\" implementation looks very different from the default hobby setup.\n\nFirst, the model shouldn’t have direct power. It shouldn’t have raw network access, raw filesystem access, or ambient credentials sitting in environment variables. It should only be able to request actions.\n\nSecond, every capability should be explicitly defined and allowlisted. No silent skill installs. No transitive dependency installs at runtime. If something gets added, it happens in a controlled build step with review and version pinning.\n\nThird, all external effects should go through a choke point you control. If it wants to send an email, make an HTTP request, write to a database, or touch Slack, it calls a guarded tool. That tool enforces policy, rate limits, domain restrictions, and writes to an immutable audit log. No raw SMTP. No arbitrary outbound HTTP.\n\nFourth, assume it will try to exfiltrate if it can. That means default deny on network egress, strict sandboxing, and strong logging that lives outside the agent runtime.\n\nIs there a \"perfect\" secure setup that still keeps full utility? Probably not. The more useful the agent is, the more power it needs. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s constrained, mediated power with visibility and revocability.\n\nSo I wouldn’t say these frameworks are doomed. I’d say most default installs are way too permissive for production. A secure OpenClaw implementation would look less like a plugin playground and more like a tightly sandboxed execution engine with a policy layer in front of every meaningful action.",

I have been using a lot of reactive tools that require me initiating everything so Im enticed by the proactive nature of open claw so I see it as starting with proactive features I want to make a more deterministic implementation of. That said, I was trashing the initial release but i think it is usable for personal setups for informed users now.\n\nI originally planned a series of vms with separate controls but there are several layers of isolation included now in open claw. I'm still configuring an internal only container and an external accessible vm install because I wanted to be as conservative as possible assuming the external facing one will be contaminated but sandboxing seems legitimately incorporated in open claw now where it's not irresponsible now to have one gateway with different agent profiles to achieve similar separation IMO. \n\nBoth my instances are locked down to only be able to use tools I give them. The external one has no access to any sensitive info but can gather information and put it together for me to allow it to save it in my tools. But until I approve it everything is ephemeral in the container sandbox. The second one is internal only with a lot of read only access but any write requires my approval. So that allows it to proactively review solutions without compromising my tools.\n\nInsider threat is always the most dangerous and even more so with tools that replicate human logic but lack the ability to actually think.",

Silent skill installation is a supply chain attack surface and most users have no idea it exists. You're not just trusting the skill, you're trusting everything that skill decides to pull in at runtime.\n\nA \"secure\" OpenClaw implementation would need at minimum: process-level isolation per skill so a compromised package can't read memory or environment variables from the agent runtime, network egress controls so background jobs can't phone home, and some kind of attestation that what's running matches what you installed. None of that exists out of the box.\n\nThe deeper issue is that the whole skill ecosystem is built on implicit trust. Skills run in the same execution context as the agent, which means they have access to everything the agent has access to  credentials, session tokens, whatever's in the environment. A dropper skill doesn't need to escalate privileges, it already has them.\n\nDocker helps at the surface level but shared kernel is a real limitation here  if a skill finds a kernel exploit, the container boundary doesn't save you. The honest answer is that a properly isolated implementation needs the skill execution to happen in a separate environment with explicit, audited permissions for every outbound action. Most people are nowhere near that and don't realize it.",

      "text": "Hey! I was recently hired to build an AI shopping assistant for a huge brand, 1B$+ in revenue. Unfortunately can't say which one is it (damn NDAs), but I thought I'd share some lessons. After the project CTO told me “Working with you was the best AI investment in the last year”, so I guess it went well!\n\nI'm reposting this from my linkedin, so sorry for this \"linkedinish\" vibe:\n\nThe biggest secret was, surprise, surprise, **not** wasn’t fancy AI methods, complex RAG pipelines, and multi step workflows. In the end it was good prompts, a bunch of domain-specific tools and one subagent.  \n  \nThe secret was the process.  \n  \nI didn’t know anything about skincare so I had to learn about it. Even light understanding of the domain turned out EXTREMELY IMPORTANT since it allowed m to play around with an agent and have a good judgement whether it says good things. The fastest feedback loop is always \"in your head\".   \n  \nI built a domain-specific dashboard for the client. A collaborative environment where domain experts can play around with an agent, comment, feedback, etc. I took the idea from [Hamel Husain](https://x.com/HamelHusain) who said that [“The Most Important AI Investment is A Simple Data Viewer”.](https://x.com/i/status/1991903412997509372) He was damn right about it.   \n  \nThe last thing is something that is not talked much about but it should. We got hundreds of files about company knowledge. This knowledge is spread around big organisations like crazy. But if you really really understand the domain, if you really digest it all and ask a lot of questions, you’ll be able to COMPRESS this knowledge. You’ll find common stuff, remove dead ends, and really narrow it down to sth that expresses most about this company in smallest piece of text. This is your system prompt!! Why split context and add a potential point of failure if you can have MOST of the important stuff always in the system prompt? It’s crazy how well it works.  \n  \nOn the context engineering side we ended up with a great system prompt + a bunch of tools for getting info about products. I added one subagent for more complex stuff (routine building), but that was the only “fancy” thing out there.  \n  \nI think the lesson here is that building agents is not hard on the technical level, and every developer can do it! The models do all the heavy lifting and they’re only getting better. The secret is understanding the domain and extracting the domain knowledge from people who know it. It's communication.\n\n  \nI'm curious:\n\nHave you built such \"customer support\"-related agents for your companies too? One thing that triggers me is amount of those giant SaaS companies that promises \"the super ultra duper ai agent\", and honestly? I think they don't have much secret sauce. Models are doing heavy lifting, and simple methods where heavy lifting is done by domain-specific knowledge trump general purpose ones. \n\nHere's what Malte from Vercel recently wrote btw:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h2pjrjfix1jg1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8cd25ac93ee3a1b92cab153a1c591edbaf35d78\n\nIt somehow clicks.",

I've built a few projects for myself and feel confident in my technical abilities, but now I'm looking to transition this into actual client work.\n\nBefore I jump in, I'd really appreciate learning from people who've already walked this path. If you've sold RAG solutions to clients, I'd love to hear about your experience:\n\n**Client & Project Details:**\n\n* What types of clients/industries did you work with?\n* How did they discover they needed RAG? (Did they come asking for it, or did you identify the use case?)\n* What was the scope? (customer support, internal knowledge base, document search, etc.)\n\n**Delivery & Timeline:**\n\n* How long did the project take from discovery to delivery?\n* What were the biggest technical challenges you faced?\n* Did you handle ongoing maintenance, or was it a one-time delivery?\n\n**Business Side:**\n\n* How did you find these clients? (freelance platforms, LinkedIn outreach, referrals, content marketing, etc.)\n* What did you charge? (ballpark is fine, just trying to understand market rates)\n* How did you structure pricing? (fixed project, hourly, monthly retainer?)\n\n**Post-Delivery:**\n\n* Were clients happy with the results?\n* Did you iterate/improve the system after launch?\n* Any lessons learned that you'd do differently next time?\n\nThanks !",

      "text": "Hey all,\n\nThis past summer I was interning as an SWE at a large finance company, and noticed that there was a huge initiative deploying AI agents. Despite this, almost all Engineering Directors I spoke with were complaining that the current agents had no ability to recall information after a little while (in fact, the company chatbot could barely remember after exchanging 6–10 messages).\n\nI discussed this grievance with some of my buddies at other firms and Big Tech companies and noticed that this issue was not uncommon (although my company’s internal chatbot was laughably bad).\n\nAll that said, I have to say that this \"memory bottleneck\" poses a tremendously compelling engineering problem, and so I am trying to give it a shot and am curious what you all think.\n\nAs you probably already know, vector embeddings are great for similarity search via cosine/BM25, but the moment you care about things like persistent state, relationships between facts, or how context changes over time, you begin to hit a wall.\n\nRight now I am playing around with a hybrid approach using a vector plus graph DB. Embeddings handle semantic recall, and the graph models entities and relationships. There is also a notion of a \"reasoning bank\" akin to the one outlined in Googles famous paper several months back. TBH I am not 100 percent confident that this is the right abstraction or if I am doing too much. \n\nHas anyone here experimented with structured or temporal memory systems for agents?\n\nIs hybrid vector plus graph reasonable, or is there a better established approach I should be looking at?\n\nAny and all feedback or pointers at this stage would be very much appreciated.",
