          "text": "something to clarify, have you trained a model that is approximately 0.125B (125M) parameters? as that's the implication from your statement of 250MB of space. if so, that's a very constrained optimisation space you're working in, and whilst u/SamWest98 is probably correct that using a pre-existing small model would do the trick it is an interesting challenge you've set for yourself.\n\nas to your questions:\n\n1) It probably is a reasonable direction to go, though you'll likely need to specialise the model heavily, as 250MB is tiny. thus, you'll be wanting to focus on summarisation for finetuning. it may be beneficial to use synthetically generated samples for summarisation when you finetune for task as you'll be able to tailor final behaviour more readily that way too.\n\n2) I'd recommend checking out this [article](https://huggingface.co/blog/codelion/optimal-model-architecture). it goes into detail about the hyperparameter optimisation that can be done and some of the interesting things that are noted performance wise in response. if you've done only one training run, then it's probable that the particular combination of layers, embedding dim, etcetera could be optimised. granted, there is also a point where one has to stop and commit to a design. but that is always up to you, as you are the final arbiter of what you're satisfied with. \n\nanyway, good luck! also your English is perfectly fine!",

Depends a lot on your current implenentation though.\n\nIf what you made relies on llama.cpp it will be kinnda tough to turn into an apk, but it can work through Termux. I bring this up becausr from what I understand your intended use case depends on some kind of web-search. So you'd input something like \"quantum tunneling\" and somehow search for results online, pass it to your LLM for summarizing and the outpuy would be an explanation of quantum tunnelibg based on the results. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I assume it to be the case as there is no way a large amount of world knowledge is gonna fit on such a small LLM.\n\nBottomline is the scaffolding around it is as important as the LLM. Also, as cool as Termux is, it's a heek thing and relying om it is going to leave 95% of users out, not a problem if you don't cate abouy massivity though.",

      "text": "Original post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1ky21fy/i_accidentally_built_a_vector_database_using)\n\nSix months ago, I published a weird weekend experiment where I stored text embeddings inside video frames.\n\nI expected maybe 20 people to see it. Instead it got:\n\n* Over 10M views\n* 10k stars on GitHub \n* And thousands of other developers building with it.\n\nOver 1,000 comments came in, some were very harsh, but I also got some genuine feedback. I spoke with many of you and spent the last few months building Memvid v2: it’s faster, smarter, and powerful enough to replace entire RAG stacks.\n\n\n\nThanks for all the support.\n\nPs: I added a little surprise at the end for developers and OSS builders 👇\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Memvid replaces RAG + vector DBs entirely with a single portable memory file.\n* Stores knowledge as Smart Frames (content + embedding + time + relationships)\n* 5 minute setup and zero infrastructure.\n* Hybrid search with sub-5ms retrieval\n* Fully portable and open Source\n\n**What my project does?** Give your AI Agent Memory In One File.\n\n**Target Audience:** Everyone building AI agent.\n\n**GitHub Code:**[ https://github.com/memvid/memvid](https://github.com/memvid/memvid)\n\n—----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Some background:**\n\n* AI memory has been duct-taped together for too long.\n* RAG pipelines keep getting more complex, vector DBs keep getting heavier, and agents still forget everything unless you babysit them. \n* So we built a completely different memory system that replaces RAG and vector databases entirely.  \n\n**What is Memvid:**\n\n* Memvid stores everything your agent knows inside a single portable file, that your code can read, append to, and update across interactions.\n* Each fact, action and interaction is stored as a self‑contained “Smart Frame” containing the original content, its vector embedding, a timestamp and any relevant relationships. \n* This allows Memvid to unify long-term memory and external information retrieval into a single system, enabling deeper, context-aware intelligence across sessions, without juggling multiple dependencies. \n* So when the agent receives a query, Memvid simply activates only the relevant frames, by meaning, keyword, time, or context, and reconstructs the answer instantly.\n* The result is a small, model-agnostic memory file your agent can carry anywhere.  \n\n**What this means for developers:**\n\nMemvid replaces your entire RAG stack.\n\n* Ingest any data type\n* Zero preprocessing required\n* Millisecond retrieval\n* Self-learning through interaction\n* Saves 20+ hours per week\n* Cut infrastructure costs by 90%\n\nJust plug Memvid into your agent and you instantly get a fully functional, persistent memory layer right out of the box.\n\n**Performance & Compatibility**\n\n(tested on my Mac M4)\n\n* Ingestion speed: 157 docs/sec \n* Search Latency: <17ms retrieval for 50,000 documents\n* Retrieval Accuracy: beating leading RAG pipelines by over 60%\n* Compression: up to 15× smaller storage footprint\n* Storage efficiency: store 50,000 docs in a \\~200 MB file\n\nMemvid works with every model and major framework: GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, LangChain, Autogen and custom-built stacks. \n\nYou can also 1-click integrate with your favorite IDE (eg. VS Code, Cursor)\n\nIf your AI agent can read a file or call a function, it can now remember forever.\n\nAnd your memory is 100% portable: Build with GPT → run on Claude → move to Llama. The memory stays identical.\n\n**Bonus for builders**\n\nAlongside Memvid V2, we’re releasing 4 open-source tools, all built on top of Memvid:\n\n* **Memvid ADR** → is an MCP package that captures architectural decisions as they happen during development. When you make high-impact changes (e.g. switching databases, refactoring core services), the decision and its context are automatically recorded instead of getting lost in commit history or chat logs.\n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/adrflow](https://github.com/memvid/adrflow)\n* **Memvid Canvas** →  is a UI framework for building fully-functional AI applications on top of Memvid in minutes. Ship customer facing or internal enterprise agents with zero infra overhead.\n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/canvas](https://github.com/memvid/canvas)\n* **Memvid Mind** → is a persistent memory plugin for coding agents that captures your codebase, errors, and past interactions. Instead of starting from scratch each session, agents can reference your files, previous failures, and full project context, not just chat history. Everything you do during a coding session is automatically stored and ingested as relevant context in future sessions. \n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/memvid-mind](https://github.com/memvid/memvid-mind)\n* **Memvid CommitReel** → is a rewindable timeline for your codebase stored in a single portable file. Run any past moment in isolation, stream logs live, and pinpoint exactly when and why things broke.\n   * GitHub Link: [https://github.com/memvid/commitreel](https://github.com/memvid/commitreel)\n\nAll 100% open-source and available today.\n\nMemvid V2 is the version that finally feels like what AI memory should’ve been all along.\n\nIf any of this sounds useful for what you’re building, I’d love for you to try it and let me know how we can improve it.",

      "text": "Hi Peeps,\n\nI'm excited to announce [Kreuzberg](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg) v4.0.0. \n\n## What is Kreuzberg:\n\nKreuzberg is a document intelligence library that extracts structured data from 56+ formats, including PDFs, Office docs, HTML, emails, images and many more. Built for RAG/LLM pipelines with OCR, semantic chunking, embeddings, and metadata extraction. \n\nThe new v4 is a ground-up rewrite in Rust with a bindings for 9 other languages! \n\n## What changed:\n\n- **Rust core**: Significantly faster extraction and lower memory usage. No more Python GIL bottlenecks.\n- **Pandoc is gone**: Native Rust parsers for all formats. One less system dependency to manage.\n- **10 language bindings**: Python, TypeScript/Node.js, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, PHP, Elixir, Rust, and WASM for browsers. Same API, same behavior, pick your stack.\n- **Plugin system**: Register custom document extractors, swap OCR backends (Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR), add post-processors for cleaning/normalization, and hook in validators for content verification.\n- **Production-ready**: REST API, MCP server, Docker images, async-first throughout.\n- **ML pipeline features**: ONNX embeddings on CPU (requires ONNX Runtime 1.22.x), streaming parsers for large docs, batch processing, byte-accurate offsets for chunking.\n\n## Why polyglot matters:\n\nDocument processing shouldn't force your language choice. Your Python ML pipeline, Go microservice, and TypeScript frontend can all use the same extraction engine with identical results. The Rust core is the single source of truth; bindings are thin wrappers that expose idiomatic APIs for each language.\n\n## Why the Rust rewrite:\n\nThe Python implementation hit a ceiling, and it also prevented us from offering the library in other languages. Rust gives us predictable performance, lower memory, and a clean path to multi-language support through FFI.\n\n## Is Kreuzberg Open-Source?:\n\nYes! Kreuzberg is MIT-licensed and will stay that way. \n\n## Links\n\n- [Star us on GitHub](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg)\n- [Read the Docs](https://kreuzberg.dev/)\n- [Join our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/38pF6qGpYD)\n",

      "text": "I keep seeing the same pattern with enterprise AI agents: they look fine in demos, then break once they’re embedded in real workflows.\n\nThis usually isn’t a model or tooling problem. The agents have access to the right systems, data, and policies.\n\nWhat’s missing is **decision context**.\n\nMost enterprise systems record outcomes, not reasoning. They store that a discount was approved or a ticket was escalated, but not *why* it happened. The context lives in Slack threads, meetings, or individual memory.\n\nI was thinking about this again after reading Jaya Gupta’s article on **context graphs**, which describes the same gap. A context graph treats decisions as first-class data by recording the inputs considered, rules evaluated, exceptions applied, approvals taken, and the final outcome, and linking those traces to entities like accounts, tickets, policies, agents, and humans.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/upw4879w5zag1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=25c8abbab1d6fb2a7cc24e146a8f48524b28b2d0\n\nThis gap is manageable when humans run workflows because people reconstruct context from experience. It becomes a hard limit once agents start acting inside workflows. Without access to prior decision reasoning, agents treat similar cases as unrelated and repeatedly re-solve the same edge cases.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that this isn’t something existing systems of record are positioned to fix. CRMs, ERPs, and warehouses store state before or after decisions, not the decision process itself. Agent orchestration layers, by contrast, sit directly in the execution path and can capture decision traces as they happen.\n\nI wrote a deeper piece exploring why this pushes enterprises toward **context-driven platforms** and what that actually means in practice. Feel free to read it [here](https://www.tensorlake.ai/blog/context-driven-enterprise-platform).",

      "text": "**TL;DR:** I got tired of guessing whether models would fit on my GPU. So I built [vramio](https://vramio.ksingh.in) — a free API that tells you exactly how much VRAM any HuggingFace model needs. One curl command. Instant answer.\n\n---\n\n## The Problem Every ML Engineer Knows\n\nYou're browsing HuggingFace. You find a model that looks perfect for your project. Then the questions start:\n\n- \"Will this fit on my 24GB RTX 4090?\"\n- \"Do I need to quantize it?\"\n- \"What's the actual memory footprint?\"\n\nAnd the answers? They're nowhere.\n\nSome model cards mention it. Most don't. You could download the model and find out the hard way. Or dig through config files, count parameters, multiply by bytes per dtype, add overhead for KV cache...\n\nI've done this calculation dozens of times. It's tedious. It shouldn't be.\n\n## The Solution: One API Call\n\n```bash\ncurl \"https://vramio.ksingh.in/model?hf_id=mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1\"\n```\n\nThat's it. You get back:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"model\": \"mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1\",\n  \"total_parameters\": \"7.24B\",\n  \"memory_required\": \"13.49 GB\",\n  \"recommended_vram\": \"16.19 GB\",\n  \"other_precisions\": {\n    \"fp32\": \"26.99 GB\",\n    \"fp16\": \"13.49 GB\",\n    \"int8\": \"6.75 GB\",\n    \"int4\": \"3.37 GB\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**`recommended_vram`** includes the standard 20% overhead for activations and KV cache during inference. This is what you actually need.\n\n## How It Works\n\nNo magic. No downloads. Just math.\n\n1. Fetch safetensors metadata from HuggingFace (just the headers, ~50KB)\n2. Parse tensor shapes and data types\n3. Calculate: `parameters × bytes_per_dtype`\n4. Add 20% for inference overhead\n\nThe entire thing is **160 lines of Python** with a single dependency (`httpx`).\n\n## Why I Built This\n\nI run models locally. A lot. Every time I wanted to try something new, I'd waste 10 minutes figuring out if it would even fit.\n\nI wanted something dead simple:\n- No signup\n- No rate limits\n- No bloated web UI\n- Just an API endpoint\n\nSo I built it over a weekend and deployed it for free on Render.\n\n## Try It\n\n**Live API:** https://vramio.ksingh.in/model?hf_id=YOUR_MODEL_ID\n\n**Examples:**\n```bash\n# Llama 2 7B\ncurl \"https://vramio.ksingh.in/model?hf_id=meta-llama/Llama-2-7b\"\n\n# Phi-2\ncurl \"https://vramio.ksingh.in/model?hf_id=microsoft/phi-2\"\n\n# Mistral 7B\ncurl \"https://vramio.ksingh.in/model?hf_id=mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1\"\n```\n\n## Self-Host It\n\nIt's open source. Run your own:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/ksingh-scogo/vramio.git\ncd vramio\npip install httpx[http2]\npython server_embedded.py\n```\n\n## What's Next\n\nThis solves my immediate problem. If people find it useful, I might add:\n- Batch queries for multiple models\n- Training memory estimates (not just inference)\n- Browser extension for HuggingFace\n\nBut honestly? The current version does exactly what I needed. Sometimes simple is enough.\n\n---\n\n**GitHub:** https://github.com/ksingh-scogo/vramio\n\nBuilt with help from [hf-mem](https://github.com/alvarobartt/hf-mem) by @alvarobartt.\n\n---\n\n*If this saved you time, consider starring the repo. And if you have ideas for improvements, open an issue — I'd love to hear them.*\n",

      "text": "DeepSeek dropped a research paper on New Year's Eve called \"Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections\" that I think is worth paying attention to.\n\n**Quick background on the problem:**\n\nStandard AI models struggle to share information across layers as they get deeper. It's been theorised that increasing this ability would result in more effective models, but it's never worked in practice. Multiple experiments have shown that training becomes unstable and models start to crash.\n\n**What DeepSeek did:**\n\nThey applied a mathematical constraint that effectively puts \"guardrails\" on how information flows. The result is that they can run parallel streams of reasoning without the model becoming unstable.\n\nThe cost is negligible (around 6% overhead), but the gain is smarter, denser models that learn more efficiently per GPU hour.\n\n**Why this is interesting:**\n\nDeepSeek has been forced into playing an efficiency game due to chip export controls, while US labs tend to solve bottlenecks by throwing compute at them. This paper is another example of them redesigning the architecture itself rather than just scaling up.\n\nDeepSeek has a habit of releasing papers before publishing new models, so we might see this deployed soon.\n\nIf it checks out, it would be very interesting to see how this affects the valuation of US AI firms - which is basically pegged to their compute right now.\n\nLink to paper: [\\[2512.24880\\] mHC: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24880)",

Which did something similar but with population evolution instead of back prop.\n\nFrom what I have read the pressure to rewire and it's clip is uniform across layers. I am working on a kind of augmenting topology where an MLP optimizes the topology (nested learning) by looking at gradient heuristics and the hyper connections themself (Jepa style). The learned optimizer is frequently driving change rates of layers 0-2 to 0, and subsequent layers keep receiving more and more pressure to change as it goes deeper. The sharpest rise is as it approaches the middle layer, and then it becomes asymptotic the deeper the layers go. \n\nThis makes changes much more predictable. If I change something at step 1, the cumulative effect by step 12 is massive. It's much easier to determine what changes are optimal when we are closer to the exit. Doing this optimization naively through gradient heuristics with and with out nested learning also has similar results.\n\nSince mHC is not respecting this behavior that I'm observing to occur naturally for stability, I don't think they've fully solved the problem. They've provided a working prototype. I am also working on an SSM, the behavior on a transformer may be different. Literature seems to agree that manifold changes are more stable on SSM though, so they're good fits. Which makes sense, as we carry our state's forward in meaningful ways in SSMs so this upstream chaos is more natural for an SSM to optimize for.\n\nAlso note, they are swapping hyper connections, I am swapping blocks of neurons.",

      "text": "A lot of people have started using the word “slop” as shorthand for AI-generated code. Their stance is that AI is flooding the industry with low-quality software, and we’re all going to pay for it later in outages, regressions, and technical debt.\n\nThis argument sounds convincing until you look honestly at how software has actually been built for the last 20 years.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that “slop” didn’t start with AI. In fact, it is AI that made it impossible to keep pretending otherwise.\n\nOutside of Google’s famously rigorous review culture, most Big Tech giants (Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft included) have historically prioritized speed.\n\nIn the real world, PRs are often skimmed, bugs are fixed after users report them, and the architecture itself evolves after the product proves itself. We didn’t call this \"slop\" back then; we called it an MVP.\n\nBy comparison, some of the code that coding agents deliver today is already better than the typical early-stage PRs in many companies. And in hindsight, we have always been willing to trade internal code purity for external market velocity.\n\nThe primary exception is open-source projects, which operate differently. Open source has consistently produced reliable, maintainable code, even with contributions from dozens or hundreds of developers.\n\nAnd the reason it works is that the projects maintain strict API boundaries and clean abstractions so that someone with zero internal context can contribute without breaking the system. If we treat an AI agent like an external open-source contributor, i.e. someone who needs strict boundaries and automated feedback to be successful, the \"slop\" disappears.\n\nI'm building an open-source coding agent called Pochi, and I have this feature where users can share their chat history along with the agent response to help debug faster. What I've realised, reading their conversations, is that the output of an AI agent is only as good as the contextual guardrails one builds around it.\n\nThe biggest problem with AI code is its tendency to \"hallucinate\" nonexistent libraries or deprecated syntax. This is because developers convey changes from a \"Prompt Engineering\" lens instead of an \"Environment Engineering\" perspective.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you go to see, users never see “slop.” They see broken interfaces, slow loading times, crashes, and unreliable features.\n\nI believe, if you dismiss AI code as \"slop,\" you are missing out on the greatest velocity shift in the history of computing. By combining Open Source discipline (rigorous review and modularity) with AI-assisted execution, we can finally build software that is both fast to ship and resilient to change.",

Instead, the model can generate and execute code that recursively inspects, splits, and processes the context.\n\n**Why TypeScript?**\n\n\\* Native to Node / Bun / Deno: no Python subprocesses or servers\n\n\\* Uses V8 isolates for sandboxed execution instead of Python REPLs\n\n\\* Strong typing with Zod schemas, so the LLM understands structured context\n\n**What it does?**\n\n\\* Lets an LLM generate code to explore large context\n\n\\* Executes that code safely in a sandbox\n\n\\* Recursively calls sub-LLMs as needed\n\n\\* Tracks iterations and sub-calls for visibility\n\n**Repo:** [**https://github.com/code-rabi/rllm**](https://github.com/code-rabi/rllm)\n\nIt’s still early, but usable. I’d love feedback on:\n\n\\* API design\n\n\\* Safety / sandboxing approach\n\n\\* Real-world use cases where this could shine\n\nHappy to answer questions or hear critiques!",

Plan mode + plan reviewer sub-agent: Claude thinks before coding, a separate sub-agent with fresh context catches architectural gaps\n2. Coding agent memory: my agent files [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) (like GitHub issues but way better, and live in Git) and works off of them so each session I can just start with \"What's next?\" and my coding agent knows what to work on.\n3. Code reviewer sub-agent: Fresh context window dedicated to catching security holes and edge cases\n4. \"Land the plane\":  One phrase triggers tests, lint, formatting, clean up, commit, push\n\nWhy sub-agents matter:\n\nYour main agent juggles too much -  file contents, conversation history, your requests. Load it with detailed standards and it does a mediocre job at everything.\n\nSub-agents specialize. Each starts fresh, enforces specific standards, returns findings. The plan reviewer knows my architecture patterns. The code reviewer knows my code and security requirements. They catch what the implementation mindset misses.\n\nWhat I'm optimizing for:\n1. Ship fast\n2. No security holes or missed edge cases\n3. Context window stays small (research shows LLM performance degrades past ~40%)\n4. Codebase stays clean as it grows so I can build fast and confidently\n\n[Full writeup with my system prompt, sub agent definitions, and interactive demo](https://willness.dev/blog/claude-code-workflow).",

This adapter approach is clever because it sidesteps that entire problem.\n\nThe vector-to-vector mapping is the key insight here. You're not trying to recreate the original text understanding, just translating between learned representations. That's why you can get 93% of OpenAI performance without touching the original documents.\n\nThe domain restriction makes sense too. A general-purpose adapter would probably fail because different models emphasize different semantic features. Training on specific domains lets you learn which features actually matter for that use case.\n\nOne thing to watch out for is drift over time. If your query distribution changes significantly from what the adapter was trained on, that quality score becomes critical. You'll want monitoring around when to fall back to the original embedding model.\n\nThe latency numbers are compelling for high-volume scenarios. 70x speedup means you could handle query spikes without hitting rate limits or burning through API costs. That's especially useful for user-facing search where response time matters.\n\nAre you planning adapters for other model families? The current coverage hits the main commercial providers, but there's probably demand for open-source model bridges too. Something like BGE or Instructor models would round out the ecosystem.\n\nAlso curious about the training data requirements. How much domain-specific data do you need to train a reliable adapter for a new use case?",

The v2 models I'm training are much more advanced but I think even with what's released  people will start to see the value. \n\nCutting even 10% of embedding costs can be huge for companies who do RAG. If you are a startup / represent a company, I have licensable models that are much higher fidelity, can be run locally, are extremely fast, and excel in air-gapped environments.\n\nTrying to get this bird off the ground and genuinely need all the help from the community and anyone else who is able. Please spread the word.  If nothing else please use and enjoy. It really works. It's not a gimic. And the library is open to anyone to add to.

      "text": "I have seen most AI agents fail in production not because they can’t reason, but because they forget. Past decisions, failures, and context vanish between sessions, so agents repeat the same mistakes and need constant babysitting. What if memory was treated as a first class system, not just longer prompts or retrieval?\n\nHindsight is an open source agent memory system built around that idea. Instead of replaying transcripts, it stores experiences, facts, and observations separately, then uses reflection to form higher level insights over time. The goal isn’t just recall, but behavior change in long running agents.\n\nI have been exploring it and early benchmarks look promising, but I’m more interested in real world feedback from people building agents outside demos.\n\nDocs:[ https://hindsight.vectorize.io/](https://hindsight.vectorize.io/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)GitHub:[ https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nWould love thoughts from folks working on agent memory, long running workflows, or systems that need consistency over time.\n\n",

      "text": "Hi peeps,\n\nAs I wrote in the title. I and my cofounders decided to open https://grantflow.ai as source-available (BSL) and make the repo public. Why? well, we didn't manage to get sufficient traction in our former strategy, so we decided to pivot. Additionally, I had some of my mentees helping with the development (junior devs), and its good for their GitHub profiles to have this available. \n\nYou can see the codebase here: https://github.com/grantflow-ai/grantflow -- I worked on this extensively for the better part of a year. This features a complex and high performance RAG system with the following components:\n\n1. An `indexer` service, which uses [kreuzberg](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg) for text extraction.\n2. A `crawler` service, which does the same but for URLs.\n3. A `rag` service, which uses pgvector and a bunch of ML to perform sophisticated RAG.\n4. A `backend` service, which is the backend for the frontend.\n5. Several frontend app components, including a NextJS app and an editor based on TipTap. \n\nI am proud of this codebase - I wrote most of it, and while we did use AI agents, it started out by being hand-written and its still mostly human written. It show cases various things that can bring value to you guys:\n\n1. how to integrate SQLAlchemy with pgvector for effective RAG\n2. how to create evaluation layers and feedback loops\n3. usage of various Python libraries with correct async patterns (also ML in async context)\n4. usage of the Litestar framework in production\n5. how to create an effective uv + pnpm monorepo\n6. advanced GitHub workflows and integration with terraform\n\nI'm glad to answer questions. \n\nP.S. if you wanna chat with me on discord, I am on the [Kreuzberg discord server](https://discord.gg/D5ZR83W5KM)",

But most implementations use the same model with different personas, which shares the same blind spots.\n\nWe built something different: **Chain-of-Debate** using actually heterogeneous LLMs, **plus a layered verification system.**\n\nWhy Different Models Matter?\n\nRecent research supports this distinction:\n\n\\- A study on agent heterogeneity found that using different foundation models (not just different prompts) yields 91% vs 82% accuracy on reasoning benchmarks.\n\n\\- The A-HMAD framework showed that agents with \"distinct expertise enable more comprehensive error-checking than identical agents.\"\n\n\\- AllAboutAI's TruthNet study found multi-model verification reduced hallucinations by 71%.\n\nThe key insight: Claude, GPT, and Gemini were trained on different data with different RLHF. They genuinely disagree because they have different knowledge and biases. Personas on the same model just pretend to disagree.\n\nOur Approach: Chain-of-Debate + Layered Verification\n\n**Debate Layer:**\n\n1. Heterogeneous models: Claude, GPT, and Gemini assigned opposing positions\n\n2. Structured argumentation: Each model must challenge the others with evidence\n\n3. Claim extraction: Arguments broken into atomic, verifiable claims\n\n**Verification Stack:**\n\n4. Grounding: Citations must be real and retrievable - no phantom sources or fabricated DOIs\n\n5. Semantic relevance: Does the source actually support this specific claim, or just the general topic?\n\n6. On-topic check: Catches ontology mismatch (valid source, wrong domain)\n\n7. Claim verification: Each atomic claim verified against source text independently\n\n8. False-positive suppression: Penalizes plausible-sounding claims that pass surface checks but lack real support\n\nSynthesis: Only claims surviving both cross-examination AND verification make the final output.\n\nWhat We Observed\n\nApproach                                                | Factual Accuracy |\n\n\\--------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n\nSingle model                                           |        \\~62%          |\n\nSingle model + personas                        |        \\~70%          |\n\nChain-of-Debate (no verification)           |        \\~85%          |\n\nChain-of-Debate + verification stack      |         \\~91%         |\n\n\n\nDebate alone catches reasoning errors. Verification catches grounding errors. You need both.\n\nLimitations\n\n\\- \\~3x latency vs single model\n\n\\- Works best for factual/analytical domains\n\n\\- Less tested on creative/subjective tasks\n\nOpen Questions:\n\n1. What is the Optimal number of models before diminishing returns?\n\n2. Which verification layer catches the most errors in practice?\n\n3. How to handle domains with sparse/contradictory sources?\n\n**We've been testing this privately and just opened it up. If anyone wants to try breaking it or test edge cases, drop a comment and I'll share access.**\n\n",

Much of the analysis is still somewhat speculative, it is their job to find weird patterns and make connections, after all. However, they have to cite the research that supports that opinion (they have access to a lot of research).  So, even if they found something truly novel, it wouldn't make it through the gauntlet.

We saw the same issue and built two distinct modes:\n\nAdversarial mode: Models assigned opposing positions, forced to challenge each other's claims. Good for surfacing blind spots on contested topics.\n\nCollaborative mode: Models work as peer reviewers - verify, strengthen, and flag uncertainty rather than attack. Better for domains like yours where you need consensus-building, not manufactured disagreement.\n\nWe also built an academic research mode specifically for citation-heavy work:\n\n\\- Citations must be real and retrievable (no phantom DOIs)\n\n\\- Semantic relevance check: does the source actually support this specific claim, not just the general topic?\n\n\\- Ontology matching: catches \"valid source, wrong domain\" errors\n\n\\- Each atomic claim verified independently against source text\n\nSounds similar to your citation requirement approach. The difference from forcing them to \"find problems\" is exactly what you said - we ask them to \"verify what can be grounded\" rather than \"attack what seems wrong.\"\n\nHappy to share access if you want to compare how our verification stack handles medical/clinical claims. Would be curious how it performs on your qEEG edge cases - and whether the collaborative mode fits your peer review workflow.",

Both the chatbot and the API should be able to query internal company data using RAG, such as procedures, internal documentation, and historical GLPI tickets.\n\nAuthentication would ideally be handled via LDAP / Active Directory. Image understanding and controlled internet search would be nice to have, but not strict requirements.\n\nI’m aware of projects like Open WebUI, AnythingLLM or LibreChat, but I’m not sure which ones are best suited for a company/internal setup, or whether it’s better to assemble a more modular stack (model server + vector DB + UI + auth).\n\nThis isn’t my core field and the ecosystem is moving fast, so I’d really appreciate feedback from people who’ve built or run similar setups. I’m especially interested in real-world experience, best practices.\n\nThanks in advance for any guidance !",

Most people get caught up in model selection when the real bottleneck is usually document processing.\n\nFor enterprise setups, i'd lean toward the modular approach over all-in-one tools like AnythingLLM. You get better control over each piece, especially the RAG pipeline. Something like Ollama for model serving, Qdrant or Weaviate for vectors, and a custom frontend gives you flexibility as requirements change. That's the approach I've been building around at vectorflow.dev for the document processing piece.\n\nThe tricky part isn't authentication or the web interface, it's getting your internal docs properly parsed and chunked. GLPI tickets especially can be messy with mixed formats, timestamps, and user comments all jumbled together. Your retrieval quality depends entirely on how well you handle that upstream.\n\nWatch out for permission boundaries too. You probably don't want all employees seeing all tickets or procedures. Most vector DBs handle metadata filtering, but you need to think through the access control model early.\n\nWhat types of internal docs are you planning to ingest? PDFs, wiki pages, or mostly structured data from GLPI?",

This is going to be a pain in the ass...\n\nSo the real bottleneck is document parsing, chunking strategy, and metadata design. Especially with GLPI, retrieval quality will live or die based on how well we separate signal (findings, conclusions, resolutions) from noise.\n\nPermissions are also a concern we’re starting to model early (per-entity and per-team visibility on tickets and procedures), so metadata filtering at retrieval time is likely mandatory.\n\nThe modular stack you mentioned is the direction i was leaning toward.\n\nI have no clue how to do all that since it is very new to me, but hey, we'll start by buying the machines haha\n\nThank you for your comment :)",

I'd probably run each ticket through a cleanup step first, maybe even use a smaller LLM to extract just the actual problem description and resolution before embedding.\n\nFor the BookStack pages, you're in luck since they're already structured HTML. Just watch out for navigation elements and sidebars when you're extracting content.\n\nThe metadata design is where you'll save yourself months of headaches later. I'd map out your permission model on paper first, then make sure every chunk gets tagged with team, visibility level, document type, maybe even urgency for tickets. Qdrant handles complex metadata queries pretty well if you structure it right from the start.\n\nStarting with the hardware purchase is honestly not a bad approach.

To address this, I created my own containers with the preloaded model and a pipeline to create them. Message me and I’ll send you the link.\n\nWith ollama, you have to use streaming. Non-streaming means that in some cases the response takes longer than 60s, and ollama shuts down the connection.\n\nUse LiteLLM as an abstraction layer. Makes it easy to switch between providers. I know you will implement your own, but development, testing, evaluation are all different stories.\n\nPostgreSQL now has vector support. I haven’t looked into it myself, but I will.\n\nYou probably want LBs in front of the LLM serves.

However, most modern systems are ephemeral, either on the cloud directly, or through some extra virtualization like containers. So the model has to be kept in persistent storage, or made persistent somehow.\n\nTypically the graphics cards and the computer to run them cost money. Even a 16GB VRAM node seems to cost around $1 and hour, although that went down a bit. If you have your own computer, then the cost is paid upfront because it’s purchased. My quick calculations seem to show that per token payments to the services is better.\n\nI didn’t know that you could adjust, thanks for letting me know.",

The vast majority of mothers want to support their children - being supported by your mother is the norm in nature, accept it while you need it.\n\nAI is creative work, it is learning work, it is the type of work that becomes 10 times harder the more pressure you put yourself under for it. The more pressure you feel to deliver by next month, the longer it will take you. The fastest path is not to force it, to try to find your interest in it, and grow that interest.\n\nMaking money with AI is complicated, and it won’t be quick - you need to leverage AI with some other skill to make money with it, because people won’t pay for AI they will pay for solutions - so you can enhance the solutions you can offer them, but you still need to know whatever business or skill the solutions exist in. For example, a programmer who knows AI cannot directly leverage it - but a plumber who knows AI can use AI to make more money, faster, at plumbing, by using it to fill their lead pipeline (pun intended) - or a hairdresser can use it to make more money by managing their appointments, etc. \n\nThe money is being paid to people for non-AI products and services - to make money with AI you need to enhance an existing business, help it make more money according to the specific business needs.\n\nSettle in, AI may be a path to change your life, but it will not be next month or even by Spring, you need to stabilize your situation so that you can begin steadily building your skills, trying things and figuring things out - set yourself a more realistic target, that by Jan 1 2027 you have a regular income from AI related work. \n\nThink about what businesses you have around you, what businesses your friends know and work at, what opportunities are there for you to add value with AI. You will need someone to take a chance on you, to spend time letting you discover their business specifics and experimenting with AI to help them, in order to get a track record.\n\nSo relax, breathe - if you need money by next month, it won’t be from AI - to level up in AI and find a source of money from it, you need an open ended exploration, and you need to find opportunities to practice it for others, dealing with real use cases. Start trying to solve problems with AI, using Perplexity to teach you what you need as you go, in relation to the problems you come across. \n\nBest of luck! If you want more specific advice, we’ll need more specifics:\n\n- what education you have / what other work you’ve done - what are your related strengths?\n- any businesses that your family / friends do that they’d be willing to let you look for ways to leverage AI for them\n- any other assets or resources you can leverage here",

Since you have experience in advertising, maybe that will be fastest in companies that are looking for advertising, but I don't think you will be able to charge money for your first few gigs since you also need to learn what you are doing. Once you have a few case studies as an AI consultant, you can start marketing yourself for paid gigs, and push your initial free clients to recommend you.\n\nAs far as assets, you can't leverage the ChatGPT or Gemini subscription to make money (but keep Perplexity - it's a must-have to learn the AI). The 4090 won't help make money either, if it still has most of its resale value, you could safely sell it and not lose any moneymaking ability.  (Local inference doesn't make any money, if the client really won't use the cloud, then they get their own hardware to run the inference - and local inference on that scale doesn't help you either, you should be using SOTA and near-SOTA models in the cloud. E.G. free models on OpenRouter, or super cost efficient plans like GLM coding plan.\n\nI do not think that there is a shortcut to go from 0 experience to making money with AI in < 3 months, that's the fastest I can imagine anyone getting a few free clients, learning what is needed, and getting together a portfolio that can attract paid clients. Most people need more like 6-9 months for this, but maybe if you're super motivated it could be 3 months.",

Respect for that.\n\nI’m a dev from Vietnam, also been through the “supported by family while trying to figure things out” phase. The shame is real but it’s temporary. You’re trying to change things - that matters.\n\n**Practical directions for no-code + your setup:**\n\n1. **Translation/Localization** - Your Portuguese + AI tools = real value. Businesses need PT-EN content. You already understand the nuance AI misses. Check Upwork/Fiverr for this.\n1. **AI-assisted writing** - Blog posts, product descriptions, social media content. ChatGPT + your human editing = fast output. Start cheap to build reviews, raise prices later.\n1. **Local business outreach** - Small businesses in Brazil probably don’t know AI can help them with customer service scripts, social posts, basic automation. You could be that bridge.\n\nYour hardware is honestly overkill for this kind of work - which is good. You’re not limited.\n\n**One real piece of advice:** Pick ONE direction. Your brain in crisis mode will want to try everything. Don’t. Pick the thing that feels 10% less impossible and do only that for 2 weeks.\n\nHappy to chat more in DMs if you want to talk through specifics. No agenda, just been in similar dark places and someone talking to me helped.\n\nForça, mano.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I tried using prompt compression (LLMLingua, etc.), prefix caching, etc. - but my issue was that a bunch of MCP tools expected JSONs and returned JSONs, and prompt compression was messing it up. So, I thought, let's create an OSS project trying to engineer context better.  \n  \nI’ve been working on an OSS layer called **Headroom** that tries to reduce context cost in agentic apps without breaking tool calling.\n\nThe 3 pieces:\n\n1. **Tool output compression** that tries to preserve outliers + relevant rows (vs. naive truncation)\n2. **Prefix alignment** to reduce accidental cache misses (timestamps, reorderings, etc.)\n3. **Rolling window** that drops history while keeping tool call units intact\n\n  \nI’m posting because I’d love adversarial review from people who’ve shipped agents:\n\n* What’s the nastiest tool payload you’ve seen (nested arrays, logs, etc.)?\n* Any gotchas with streaming tool calls that break proxies/wrappers?\n* If you’ve implemented prompt caching, what caused the most cache misses?\n\n  \nRepo: [**https://github.com/chopratejas/headroom**](https://github.com/chopratejas/headroom)  \n  \n(I’m the author — happy to answer anything, and also happy to be told this is a bad idea.)",

I could start using the new model without migrating anything and also would give me a chance to see how better the new model is and assess if it is worth the migration. If the legacy collections could benefit from the new embedding model I'd consider reindexing in phases gradually.\n\nIf the requirement was to query on one global collection, I would create a new collection for the new embedding - > index the content - > do A/B testing - > remove the old collection.\n\nSo it really depends on your product and use-cases. I think the key here is to measure and see if there is any benefit of using the new model before you spend a fortune to reindex the whole content.

These combinations create ambiguous attention patterns, so the model has less signal to latch onto when predicting the next token. With each token prediction the errors compound since each token depends on previous ones, and eventually the AI starts spouting pseudo-scientific babble. The user, now deeply invested, interprets this as profound insight.\n\nAll those stories of company's chatbots saying horrible things.. this is partially to blame. All your \"Don't say Nazi's are great, please, please don't talk about Nazis\" system prompts don't matter one bit when this happens.. Though you should put a fast classifier (<=500M model) to check these outputs anyway, it's a best practice if you can.\n\nWhen the context is filled with semantically scattered tokens that dilutes attention weights. The model still has to produce something, you get some random token pushed up to the top prediction list and the model doesn't have anything good to choose from. Do that over and over and over again and it will confidently agree that \"Bill Gates does implant AI into people's teeth to force them to get Xbox subscriptions\".\n\nWhen you manage context properly, the same number of tokens actually increase prediction accuracy. That's what thinking models, multi-shot prompting, and in-context learning are doing. Creating focused attention patterns that give the model clear signal to follow.\n\nFocused context = strong attention = confident predictions = fewer hallucinations.\n\nBTW: This is also why codegen AIs tend to make more mistakes until you compress their context.

This is training up a micro sized GPT on something like Shakespeare. You could seek to improve on Kaparthy's work: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ \n\n3. If the requirement is for an application, then I'd suggest NOT doing a direct language interface to the end user. This will allow you to have a \"dumber, e.g. cheaper\" LM and also addresses the many safety issues raised by direct LLM interfaces. \n\n4. For applications I'd suggest something local and small that helps a community or business with some AI smarts. Solving an actual problem will be constrain your app usefully and keep the resulting project relevant to the world. Ideas that I'd like to get around to:\n\nA) A virtual concierge for local motels/airBnB to recommend local activities for obscure attractions in the Catskills NY, USA. \n\nB) Low training data information extraction systems for medical research. \n\nDM me if you want more info or guidance.",

I just wanted to add that a major factor that makes these ai agent workflows hard to monitor is the fact that they are \"black boxed\". Because they are non-deterministic by nature, you really don't know what's going on under the hood with these agents: what tools are being called, and if the agent runs into loops, or even tool call failures. Observability is really important when it comes to these agentic workflows especially in prod.\n\nI've found that [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is the way to go for monitoring and observability. With traces you can really track all the steps that goes on when the agent gets user input, and you can setup things like alerts to monitor these incorrect tool calls, agent loops, or failures. \n\nAdditionally, with OpenTelemetry exporters, you can also keep a local copy of the same trace data and reuse it for automated or offline evaluations in your situation. That way, the same setup supports both production observability and the evaluation techniques others are mentioning, without building separate pipelines.",

Implement tracing logic to wrap whatever logic is making the LLM call to check whether the news article (input) is of \"yes\" or \"no\" relevance to your predefined keywords (output). You can use something like this: [https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/instrument/custom-tracing](https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/instrument/custom-tracing) which is from Braintrust, but feel free to use whatever tool you like (I've heard of Evalite, Posthog, Langsmith...)\n2. With this tracing logic setup, you should start to get logs with the input & output every time Agent #1 is triggered. I would recommend you trigger your Agent \\~10-15 times to get at least that many logs in your dashboard.\n3. Go to the dashboard to find these logs, and use them to create a new dataset so you can run AI evals on them (which is what is going to help you monitor/improve the accuracy of your Agent). So far your dataset will have 1) The input which is the news article 2) The Agent's output which is \"yes\" or \"no\" from the agent. We want to have you manually add in 3) Your manual \"yes\" or \"no\" output on the article's relevance, which we view as the \"correct\" answer.\n4. From there, you can run AI evals, which has 3 parts to it \n   1. The prompt, which is whatever prompt the Agent is running to determine relevance\n   2. The dataset, with your input, agent output, and your expected output\n   3. The scorer, which will judge how close your agent output is to your expected output. There are prebuilt \"relevancy\" and \"accuracy\" scorers out there. Because this is a binary workflow, the scorer will output either a 1 or 0. So for your dataset of 10 news articles, maybe your Agent scores 70% (gets 7 of the news articles correctly classified as relevant).\n5. From here, you have a good baseline established for monitoring the current accuracy of your Agent, and also to start improving it (you can tweak the prompt and see if you can get a higher accuracy).",

While I have experience building RAG systems for PDF documents, I’m unsure how to adapt this approach to source code, especially in terms of code-specific chunking, embeddings, and intelligent file selection similar to how tools like GitHub Copilot determine which files are relevant.",

Functions get split mid-implementation, class definitions get separated from their methods, import statements lose context. Most people chunk by line count or file size and wonder why their retrieval misses obvious dependencies.\n\nThe file selection problem is harder than it looks. You need to understand call graphs, dependency trees, and which files actually relate to the error patterns in the ticket. If you're chunking a React component but missing the hook it depends on, your agents are working with incomplete information.\n\nWhat kills me is how many teams discover their code chunking is broken only after they've already embedded everything. You can't see what went wrong until you're deep into agent conversations getting weird responses about missing imports or incomplete function signatures. I ended up building [VectorFlow](https://vectorflow.dev/?utm_source=redditCP_c) to debug this stuff before it hits the vector store because debugging RAG without seeing your processed code chunks is like coding blindfolded.\n\nWhat's your current thinking on handling cross-file dependencies? Are you planning to chunk at the function level or preserve larger logical units?",

      "text": "Hot take: we've basically cracked agents, context selection, and prompting. The tooling is there. Claude Code, Cursor, etc. all work pretty damn well now. Creating detailed architecture plans and spec-driven stuff with Speckit, OpenSpec, and BMAD with AI is a solved problem at this point.\n\nSo what's next? I think 2026 is gonna be about taking super detailed specs and feeding them into long-running autonomous loops that just keep going until the thing is built.\n\nAnthropic just shipped a Claude Code plugin called ralph-wiggum (named after the Simpsons character lol). It's dumb simple - literally just a while loop that keeps feeding your prompt back to the agent. Claude works on the task, tries to exit, the hook catches it and says nope here's your prompt again, and it keeps going. Each pass sees everything from before - all the file changes, git history, whatever.\n\nThey also put out research on how to get agents working across context windows since they basically get amnesia between sessions. The trick is having the agent leave itself notes - progress files, clean git commits, feature checklists. Next session boots up, reads the notes, picks up where it left off. But honestly the bigger thing here is they gave us the canvas. This is how Anthropic thinks about long-running agents - initializer agents, coding agents, progress artifacts, the whole structure. It's a blueprint.\n\nWith the Claude Agent SDK you can take this pattern and build your own bespoke harnesses for whatever workflow you want. Coding is the obvious one but there's no reason you couldn't spin up custom long-running loops for research, data processing, content pipelines, whatever. Build the harness once, feed it specs, let it grind.\n\nYou combine these things with a really solid spec upfront and suddenly you can just... let it run. Go to bed, wake up, stuff is built. The whole game shifts from prompting in real-time to writing specs that are good enough to survive autonomous execution.\n\nHonestly my main takeaway from all this is we should probably just stick to what the top engineers at Anthropic are doing. There's a million different coding agents and tools and plugins and random github projects out there and it's easy to get lost chasing shiny things. But the people building Claude probably know best how to use Claude. Claude Code + their patterns + maybe the SDK if you need something custom. Keep it simple.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum)\n* [https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13HP\\_bSeNjU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13HP_bSeNjU)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usQ2HBTTWxs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usQ2HBTTWxs)",

      "text": "I am fairly new to AI world and trying to understand if it can help us solve our use-case(s). I work for a global chemical distributor and we get hundreds of product enquiries from our customers. And they come via multiple channels, but primary is Email and WhatsApp. \n\nWith the help of Gemini and ChatGPT, we were able to form a small pipeline where these messages/emails are routed through basic filters and certain business rules. Final output we have is a JSON of Product and Quantity enquired. Goes without saying there can be multiple products in a single enquiry.\n\nNow comes the main issue. Most of the times customers use abbreviations or there are typos in the enquiries. JSON has the same. What we also have is customer-wise master data which has list of products that the customer has bought or would buy. \n\nNeed suggestions on how we can match them and get the most matched product for each of the JSON products. We are at liberty of hardware. We have a small server where I am running 20b models smoothly. Whereas, for production (or even testing), I can get VMs sanctioned. We could run models up to 80-120b. We would need to host the model ourselves as we do not want any data privacy issues.\n\nWe are also okay with latency, no real-time matching needed. We are okay with batch processing. If every customer enquiries/JSON takes couple of minutes, we are okay with that. Accuracy is the key.",

      "text": "I'd like to share [ai-rulez](https://github.com/Goldziher/ai-rulez). It's a tool for managing and generating rules, skills, subagents, context and similar constructs for AI agents. It supports basically any agent out there because it allows users to control the generated outputs, and it has out-of-the-box presets for all the popular tools (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, Opencode and several others).\n\n## Why?\n\nThis is a valid question. As someone wrote to me on a previous post -- \"this is such a temporary problem\". Well, that's true, I don't expect this problem to last for very long. Heck, I don't even expect such hugely successful tools as Claude Code itself to last very long - technology is moving so fast, this will probably become redundant in a year, or two - or three. Who knows. Still, it's a real problem now - and one I am facing myself. So what's the problem?\n\nYou can create your own .cursor, .claude or .gemini folder, and some of these tools - primarily Claude - even have support for sharing (Claude plugins and marketplaces for example) and composition. The problem really is vendor lock-in. Unlike MCP - which was offered as a standard - AI rules, and now skills, hooks, context management etc. are ad hoc additions by the various manufacturers (yes there is the AGENTS.md initiative but it's far from sufficient), and there isn't any real attempt to make this a standard.\n\nFurthermore, there are actual moves by Anthropic to vendor lock-in. What do I mean? One of my clients is an enterprise. And to work with Claude Code across dozens of teams and domains, they had to create a massive internal infra built around Claude marketplaces. This works -- okish. But it absolutely adds vendor lock-in at present.\n\nI also work with smaller startups, I even lead one myself, where devs use their own preferable tools. I use IntelliJ, Claude Code, Codex and Gemini CLI, others use VSCode, Anti-gravity, Cursor, Windsurf clients. On top of that, I manage a polyrepo setup with many nested repositories. Without a centralized solution, keeping AI configurations synchronized was a nightmare - copy-pasting rules across repos, things drifting out of sync, no single source of truth. I therefore need a single tool that can serve as a source of truth and then .gitignore the artifacts for all the different tools.\n\n## How AI-Rulez works\n\nThe basic flow is: you run `ai-rulez init` to create the folder structure with a `config.yaml` and directories for rules, context, skills, and agents. Then you add your content as markdown files - rules are prescriptive guidelines your AI must follow, context is background information about your project (architecture, stack, conventions), and skills define specialized agent personas for specific tasks (code reviewer, documentation writer, etc.). In `config.yaml` you specify which presets you want - claude, cursor, gemini, copilot, windsurf, codex, etc. - and when you run `ai-rulez generate`, it outputs native config files for each tool.\n\nA few features that make this practical for real teams:\n\nYou can compose configurations from multiple sources via includes - pull in shared rules from a Git repo, a local path, or combine several sources. This is how you share standards across an organization or polyrepo setup without copy-pasting.\n\nFor larger codebases with multiple teams, you can organize rules by domain (backend, frontend, qa) and create profiles that bundle specific domains together. Backend team generates with `--profile backend`, frontend with `--profile frontend`.\n\nThere's a priority system where you can mark rules as critical, high, medium, or low to control ordering and emphasis in the generated output.\n\nThe tool can also run as a server (supports the Model Context Protocol), so you can manage your configuration directly from within Claude or other MCP-aware tools.\n\nIt's written in Go but you can use it via npx, uvx, go run, or brew - installation is straightforward regardless of your stack. It also comes with an MCP server, so agents can interact with it (add, update rules, skill etc.) using MCP. \n\n## Examples\n\nWe use [ai-rulez](https://github.com/Goldziher/ai-rulez) in the [Kreuzberg.dev Github Organization](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev) and the open source repositories underneath it - [Kreuzberg](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg) and [html-to-markdown](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/html-to-markdown) - both of which are polyglot libraries with a lot of moving parts. The rules are shared via git, for example you can see the [config.yaml](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/html-to-markdown/blob/main/.ai-rulez/config.yaml) file in the html-to-markdown .ai-rulez folder, showing how the rules module is read from GitHub. The `includes` key is an array, you can install from git and local sources, and multiple of them - it scales well, and it supports SSH and bearer tokens as well.\n\nAt any rate, this is the [shared rules](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/ai-rulez) repository itself - you can see how the [data is organized under a .ai-rulez folder](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/ai-rulez/tree/main/.ai-rulez), and you can see how some of the data is split among [domains](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/ai-rulez/tree/main/.ai-rulez/domains).\n\nWhat do the generated files look like? Well, they're native config files for each tool - CLAUDE.md for Claude, .cursorrules for Cursor, .continuerules for Continue, etc. Each preset generates exactly what that tool expects, with all your rules, context, and skills properly formatted.\n",

      "text": "I have been working with LLM API models since the early days (GPT3) before ChatGPT became a thing. And, I was fascinated by the \"magic\" it can create. As the models got better, I have used it extensively in the last year for doing data enrichment by writing Python scripts that loop through a dataset ... and basically reproduce the same effect of prompting one-off on ChatGPT.\n\nI was surpirsed no one built a good tool to scale a prompt on every record of a dataset. Google Sheets tried but wasn't the best implementation. So, all these months, I have been saving Python scripts in notebooks and copying one notebook to another whenever I have a new data enrichment exercise.\n\nLLMs are so good for structuring unstructured data. So, I saw this as an opportunity to make my life better. And, taking inspiration from the heydays of [CodePen](https://codepen.io/trending) and [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), I figured I will create my own tool: [LLM Fiddle](https://llmfiddle.io/).\n\nIf this resonates, please give it a try and let me know what you think. Open for ideas & feedback.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/edq6qf7lmlag1.png?width=2734&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdbcf66898cc9d00ed4518ef3c93963a0f2ecf34\n\n",
