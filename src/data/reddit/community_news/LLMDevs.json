      "text": "OpenClaw has been trending for all the wrong and right reasons. I saw people rebuilding entire sites through Telegram, running “AI offices,” and one case where an agent wiped thousands of emails because of a prompt injection. That made me stop and actually look at the architecture instead of the demos.\n\nUnder the hood, it’s simpler than most people expect.\n\nOpenClaw runs as a persistent Node.js process on your machine. There’s a single Gateway that binds to localhost and manages all messaging platforms at once: WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord. Every message flows through that one process. It handles authentication, routing, session loading, and only then passes control to the agent loop. Responses go back out the same path. No distributed services. No vendor relay layer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyqx126xqgkg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aa9645ac1855c337ea73226697f4718cd175205\n\nWhat makes it feel different from ChatGPT-style tools is persistence. It doesn’t reset. Conversation history, instructions, tools, even long-term memory are just files under `~/clawd/`. Markdown files. No database. You can open them, version them, diff them, roll them back. The agent reloads this state every time it runs, which is why it remembers what you told it last week.\n\nThe heartbeat mechanism is the interesting part. A cron wakes it up periodically, runs cheap checks first (emails, alerts, APIs), and only calls the LLM if something actually changed. That design keeps costs under control while allowing it to be proactive. It doesn’t wait for you to ask.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gv6eld93rgkg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a6590c390c4d99fe7fe306f75681a2e4dbe0dbe\n\nThe security model is where things get real. The system assumes the LLM can be manipulated. So enforcement lives at the Gateway level: allow lists, scoped permissions, sandbox mode, approval gates for risky actions. But if you give it full shell and filesystem access, you’re still handing a probabilistic model meaningful control. The architecture limits blast radius, it doesn’t eliminate it.\n\nWhat stood out to me is that nothing about OpenClaw is technically revolutionary. The pieces are basic: WebSockets, Markdown files, cron jobs, LLM calls. The power comes from how they’re composed into a persistent, inspectable agent loop that runs locally.\n\nIt’s less “magic AI system” and more “LLM glued to a long-running process with memory and tools.”\n\nI wrote down the detailed breakdown [here](https://entelligence.ai/blogs/openclaw)",

Note: your tools automated analysis touches on it in the following section, “The Agent Loop: From Message to Action” and probably elsewhere but should go deeper because how these 2 components work is key to how OpenClaw works. \n\nNote: I’m thinking the review tool should really detect and break out key sub-projects with the why, how, and what as a sub-project relates to the parent project. \n\nOpenClaw is an amazing experiment built on top of some amazing open source. \n\nNote: The automated code review tool you’re building that did the actual analysis did a very reasonable job but I think it’s still a bit too surface detail oriented - imo anyway. That said I suppose one could use this report as part of the “brainstorming” stage and use sections from the report when delving deeper. Basically I’m saying more meat is needed on the bone to use this as a blueprint - though that might not be the point of this report and the tool cdn actually go deeper already (Yes/No)?\n\nCheers,\n\nChristopher",

          "text": "The only point that I would disagree on, is that prompt engineering, especially advanced prompt engineering, is about understanding the ways that the AI model might misunderstand, because of how they work. You might say that is just communication skills, but it is about understanding how they function way deeper than someone who just communicates clearly.\n\nFor example, if I spend 50% of my prompt to a text-to-image generation model, describing a specific aspect of the image, then it is going to notice that, and it will generate the picture very differently, focusing more on that aspect, than if I say what is essentially the same thing with less words. But the order that I mention things matters as well. If I am generating an image and at the end of my prompt I say something that the AI model doesn't do, I could move that sentence to the beginning of my prompt, and it would have higher priority.\n\nOne time I was trying to generate an image and my prompt contained the phrase \"flight of stairs\", and after many failed generations where the stairs were floating, and me not understanding why, I realized that the word \"flight\" although used correctly, was confusing the model, and removing it fixed the outputs.\n\nA person that is exceptional at communication is not automatically a good prompt engineer, because they don't understand these things. Specific models have their own tendencies and prompt-following quirks as well, across all mediums of AI models, so you could also argue that part of being a good prompt engineer is learning these tendencies.\n\nSo being able to communicate effectively can make you rapidly progress while learning prompt engineering, but to say that they are the same skill is not understanding the full depth of prompt engineering.",

      "text": "If you've built a RAG system, you've had the chunking conversation. Somebody on your team (or [a Medium post](https://medium.com/%40adnanmasood/chunking-strategies-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-a-comprehensive-guide-5522c4ea2a90)) told you to \"just use 512 tokens with 50-token overlap\" or \"semantic chunking is strictly better.\"\n\nWe (hello from the R&D team at Vecta!) decided to test these claims. We created a small corpus of real academic papers spanning AI, astrophysics, mathematics, economics, social science, physics, chemistry, and computer vision. Then, we ran every document through seven different chunking strategies and measured retrieval quality and downstream answer accuracy.\n\nCritically, we designed the evaluation to be fair: each strategy retrieves a different number of chunks, calibrated so that every strategy gets approximately 2,000 tokens of context in the generation prompt. This eliminates the confound where strategies with larger chunks get more context per retrieval, and ensures we're measuring chunking quality, not context window size.\n\nThe \"boring\" strategies won. The hyped strategies failed. And the relationship between chunk granularity and answer quality is more nuanced than most advice suggests.\n\n# Setup\n\n# Corpus\n\nWe assembled a diverse corpus of 50 academic papers (905,746 total tokens) deliberately spanning similar disciplines, writing styles, and document structures: Papers ranged from 3 to 112 pages and included technical dense mathematical proofs pertaining to fundamental ML research. All PDFs were converted to clean markdown using [MarkItDown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown), with OCR artifacts and single-character fragments stripped before chunking.\n\n# Chunking Strategies Tested\n\n1. **Fixed-size, 512 tokens**, 50-token overlap\n2. **Fixed-size, 1024 tokens**, 100-token overlap\n3. **Recursive character splitting**, LangChain-style `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` at 512 tokens\n4. **Semantic chunking**, embedding-based boundary detection (cosine similarity threshold 0.7)\n5. **Document-structure-aware**, splitting on markdown headings/sections, max 1024 tokens\n6. **Page-per-chunk**, one chunk per PDF page, using MarkItDown's form-feed (`\\f`) page boundaries\n7. **Proposition chunking**, LLM-decomposed atomic propositions following [Dense X Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06648) with the paper's exact extraction prompt\n\nAll chunks were embedded with `text-embedding-3-small` and stored in local ChromaDB. Answer generation used `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` via OpenRouter. We generated 30 ground-truth Q&A pairs using Vecta's synthetic benchmark pipeline.\n\n# Equal Context Budget: Adaptive Retrieval k\n\nMost chunking benchmarks use a fixed top-k (e.g., k=10) for all strategies. This is fundamentally unfair: if fixed-1024 retrieves 10 chunks, the generator sees \\~10,000 tokens of context; if proposition chunking retrieves 10 chunks at 17 tokens each, the generator gets \\~170 tokens. The larger-chunk strategy wins by default because it gets more context, not because its chunking is better.\n\nWe fix this by computing an adaptive k for each strategy. This targets \\~2,000 tokens of retrieved context for every strategy. The computed values:\n\n|Strategy|Avg Tokens/Chunk|Adaptive k|Expected Context|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Page-per-Chunk|961|2|\\~1,921|\n|Doc-Structure|937|2|\\~1,873|\n|Fixed 1024|658|3|\\~1,974|\n|Fixed 512|401|5|\\~2,007|\n|Recursive 512|397|5|\\~1,984|\n|Semantic|43|46|\\~1,983|\n|Proposition|17|115|\\~2,008|\n\nNow every strategy gets \\~2,000 tokens to work with. Differences in accuracy reflect genuine chunking quality, not context budget.\n\n# How We Score Retrieval: Precision, Recall, and F1\n\nWe evaluate retrieval at two granularities: page-level (did we retrieve the right pages?) and document-level (did we retrieve the right documents?). At each level, the core metrics are precision, recall, and F1.\n\nLet R be the set of retrieved items (pages or documents) and G be the set of ground-truth relevant items.\n\nPrecision measures: of everything we retrieved, what fraction was actually relevant? A retriever that returns 5 pages, 4 of which contain the answer, has a precision of 0.8. High precision means low noise in the context window.\n\nRecall measures: of everything that *was* relevant, what fraction did we find? If 3 pages contain the answer and we retrieved 2 of them, recall is 0.67. High recall means we're not missing important information.\n\nF1 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It penalizes strategies that trade one for the other and rewards balanced retrieval.\n\nPage-level metrics tell you whether you're pulling the right *passages*. Document-level metrics tell you whether you're pulling from the right *sources*. A strategy can score high page-level recall (finding many relevant pages) while scoring low document-level precision (those pages are scattered across too many irrelevant documents). As we'll see, the tension between these two levels is one of the main findings.\n\n# Results\n\n# The Big Picture\n\n[Figure 1: Complete metrics heatmap. Green is good, red is bad.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/metrics_heatmap.png)\n\n|Strategy|k|Doc F1|Page F1|Accuracy|Groundedness|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Recursive 512**|5|0.86|**0.92**|**0.69**|0.81|\n|**Fixed 512**|5|0.85|0.88|0.67|**0.85**|\n|**Fixed 1024**|3|**0.88**|0.72|0.61|0.86|\n|**Doc-Structure**|2|0.88|0.69|0.52|0.84|\n|**Page-per-Chunk**|2|0.88|0.69|0.57|0.81|\n|**Semantic**|46|0.42|0.91|0.54|0.81|\n|**Proposition**|115|0.27|**0.97**|0.51|**0.87**|\n\n**Recursive splitting wins on accuracy (69%) and page-level retrieval (0.92 F1).** The 512-token strategies lead on generation quality, while larger-chunk strategies lead on document-level retrieval but fall behind on accuracy.\n\n# Finding 1: Recursive and Fixed Splitting Often Outperforms Fancier Strategies\n\n[Figure 2: Accuracy and groundedness by strategy. Recursive and fixed 512 lead on accuracy.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/generation_quality.png)\n\nLangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` at 512 tokens achieved the highest accuracy (**69%**) across all seven strategies. Fixed 512 was close behind at 67%. Both strategies use 5 retrieved chunks for \\~2,000 tokens of context.\n\nWhy does recursive splitting edge out plain fixed-size? It tries to break at natural boundaries, paragraph breaks, then sentence breaks, then word breaks. On academic text, this preserves logical units: a complete paragraph about a method, a full equation derivation, a complete results discussion. The generator gets chunks that make semantic sense, not arbitrary windows that may cut mid-sentence.\n\nRecursive 512 also achieved the best page-level F1 (**0.92**), meaning it reliably finds the right pages *and* produces accurate answers from them.\n\n# Finding 2: The Granularity-Retrieval Tradeoff Is Real\n\n[Figure 3: Radar chart, recursive 512 (orange) has the fullest coverage. Large-chunk strategies skew toward doc retrieval but lose on accuracy.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/radar_comparison.png)\n\nWith a 2,000-token budget, a clear tradeoff emerges:\n\n* **Smaller chunks (k=5)** achieve higher accuracy (67-69%) because 5 retrieval slots let you sample from 5 different locations in the corpus, each precisely targeted\n* **Larger chunks (k=2-3)** achieve higher document F1 (0.88) because each retrieved chunk spans more of the relevant document, but the generator gets fewer, potentially less focused passages\n\nFixed 1024 scored the best document F1 (**0.88**) but only 61% accuracy. With just k=3, you get 3 large passages, great for document coverage, but if even one of those passages isn't well-targeted, you've wasted a third of your context budget.\n\n# Finding 3: Semantic Chunking Collapses at Scale\n\n[Figure 4: Chunk size distribution. Semantic and proposition chunking produce extremely small fragments.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/chunk_size_distribution.png)\n\nSemantic chunking produced 17,481 chunks averaging 43 tokens across 50 papers. With k=46, the retriever samples from 46 different tiny chunks. The result: only 54% accuracy and 0.42 document F1.\n\nHigh page F1 (0.91) reveals what's happening: the retriever *finds the right pages* by sampling many tiny chunks from across the corpus. But document-level retrieval collapses because those 46 chunks come from dozens of different documents, diluting precision. And accuracy suffers because 46 disconnected sentences don't form a coherent narrative for the generator.\n\n**The fundamental problem:** semantic chunking optimizes for retrieval-boundary purity at the expense of context coherence. Each chunk is a \"clean\" semantic unit, but a single sentence chunk may lack the surrounding context needed for generation.\n\n# Finding 4: The Page-Level Retrieval Story\n\n[Figure 5: Page-level precision-recall tradeoff. Recursive 512 achieves the best balance.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/precision_recall.png)\n\n[Figure 6: Page-level and document-level F1. The two metrics tell different stories.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/retrieval_f1.png)\n\nPage-level and document-level retrieval tell opposite stories under constrained context:\n\n* Fine-grained strategies (proposition k=115, semantic k=46) achieve high page F1 (0.91-0.97) by sampling many pages, but low doc F1 (0.27-0.42) because those pages come from too many documents\n* Coarse strategies (page-chunk k=2, doc-structure k=2) achieve high doc F1 (0.88) by retrieving fewer, more relevant documents, but lower page F1 (0.69) because 2 chunks can only cover 2 pages\n\nRecursive 512 at k=5 hits the best balance: 0.92 page F1 and 0.86 doc F1. Five chunks is enough to sample multiple relevant pages while still concentrating on a few documents.\n\n[Figure 7: Document-level precision, recall, and F1 detail. Large-chunk strategies lead on precision; fine-grained strategies lead on recall.](https://www.runvecta.com/blog/chunking/document_level.png)\n\n# What This Means for Your RAG System\n\n# The Short Version\n\n1. Use recursive character splitting at 512 tokens. It scored the highest accuracy (69%), best page F1 (0.92), and strong doc F1 (0.86). It's the best all-around strategy on academic text.\n2. Fixed-size 512 is a strong runner-up with 67% accuracy and the highest groundedness among the top performers (85%).\n3. If document-level retrieval matters most, use fixed-1024 or page-per-chunk (0.88 doc F1), but accept lower accuracy (57-61%).\n4. Don't use semantic chunking on academic text. It fragments too aggressively (43 avg tokens) and collapses on document retrieval (0.42 F1).\n5. Don't use proposition chunking for general RAG. 51% accuracy isn't production-ready. It's only viable if you value groundedness over correctness.\n6. When benchmarking, equalize the context budget. Fixed top-k comparisons are misleading. Use adaptive k = round(target\\_tokens / avg\\_chunk\\_tokens).\n\n# Why Academic Papers Specifically?\n\nWe deliberately chose to saturate the academic paper region of the embedding space with 50 papers spanning 10+ disciplines. When your knowledge base contains papers that all discuss \"evaluation,\" \"metrics,\" \"models,\" and \"performance,\" the retriever has to make fine-grained distinctions. That's when chunking quality matters most.\n\nIn a mixed corpus of recipes and legal contracts, even bad chunking might work because the embedding distances between domains are large. Academic papers are the *hard case* for chunking, and if a strategy works here, it'll work on easier data too.\n\n# How We Measured This (And How You Can Too)\n\nMy team built [Vecta](https://www.runvecta.com/) specifically to meet the need for precise RAG evaluation software. It generates synthetic benchmark Q&A pairs across multiple semantic granularities, then measures precision, recall, F1, accuracy, and groundedness against your actual retrieval pipeline.\n\nThe benchmarks in this post were generated and evaluated using Vecta's SDK (`pip install vecta`)\n\n# Limitations, Experiment Design, and Further Work\n\nThis experiment was deliberately small-scale: 50 papers, 30 synthetic Q&A pairs, one embedding model, one retriever, one generator. That's by design. We wanted something reproducible that a single engineer could rerun in an afternoon, not a months-long research project. The conclusions should be read with that scope in mind.\n\nSynthetic benchmarks are not human benchmarks. Our ground-truth Q&A pairs were generated by Vecta's own pipeline, which means there's an inherent alignment between how questions are formed and how they're evaluated. Human-authored questions would be a stronger test. That said, Vecta's benchmark generation does produce complex multi-hop queries that require synthesizing information across multiple chunks and document locations, so these aren't trivially easy questions that favor any one strategy by default.\n\nOne pipeline, one result. Everything here runs on text-embedding-3-small, ChromaDB, and gemini-2.5-flash-lite. Swap any of those components and the rankings could shift. We fully acknowledge this. Running the same experiment across multiple embedding models, vector databases, and generators would be valuable follow-up work, and it's on our roadmap.\n\nThe equal context budget is a deliberate constraint, not a flaw. Some readers may object that semantic and proposition chunking are \"meant\" to be paired with rerankers, fusion, or hierarchical aggregation. But if a chunking strategy only works when combined with additional infrastructure, that's important to know. Equal context budgets ensure we're comparing chunking quality at roughly equal generation cost. A strategy that requires a reranker to be competitive is a more expensive strategy, and that should factor into the decision.\n\nSemantic chunking was not intentionally handicapped. Our semantic chunking produced fragments averaging 43 tokens, which is smaller than most production deployments would target. This was likely due to a poorly tuned cosine similarity threshold (0.7) rather than any deliberate sabotage. But that's actually the point: semantic chunking requires careful threshold tuning, merging heuristics, and often parent-child retrieval to work well. When those aren't perfectly dialed in, it degrades badly. Recursive splitting, by contrast, produced strong results with default parameters. The brittleness of semantic chunking under imperfect tuning is itself a finding.\n\n**What we'd like to do next:**\n\n* Rerun the experiment with human-authored Q&A pairs alongside the synthetic benchmark\n* Test across multiple embedding models (`text-embedding-3-large`, open-source alternatives) and generators (GPT-4o, Claude, Llama)\n* Add reranking and hierarchical retrieval stages, then measure whether the rankings change when every strategy gets access to the same post-retrieval pipeline\n* Expand the corpus beyond academic papers to contracts, documentation, support tickets, and other common RAG domains\n* Test semantic chunking with properly tuned thresholds, chunk merging, and sliding windows to establish its ceiling\n\nIf you run any of these experiments yourself, we'd genuinely like to see the results.\n\nHave a chunking strategy that worked surprisingly well (or badly) for you?

Without a cap + light overlap, you’ll get unstable context budgets and retrieval noise. It might improve coherence but hurt coverage. If avg paragraph is \\~300–400 tokens, your adaptive k probably lands around 5–6 for a 2k token budget. That’s similar to Recursive 512, so gains may be marginal unless paragraphs align unusually well with answer spans.\n\nWould be interesting to see paragraph + max 768 cap vs Recursive 512 head-to-head. My bet: small lift in groundedness, similar accuracy, slightly worse page recall.",

The transformer architecture is able to achieve a functionality prior impossible, even with data center level of resources. \n\nThere are many other interesting theoretical implications of transformers, but one of the biggest was the fact that it didn’t follow the law of diminishing return as aggressively as other models. Most models were restricted to a specific type of task and/or topped off quickly when generalized, flattening regardless of parameter count increase. Transformers however have continuously gotten better and shown better generalizability as parameter count has increased. \n\nSo, I would say that while they are resource hogs, I would not generally classify the transformer as “inefficient”. Yes, maybe compared to a standard program, but that program has nowhere near the capability of the deployed LLM. I would say it’s quite efficient for what it does and we’re attempting to push it as far as we can at scale. \n\nThat being said, the reason we’re scaling hardware is because product X shows some capability and economic benefit both short and long term, that companies have deemed it valuable enough to invest Y dollars for Z return. \n\nOptimizations constantly happen. Can use mixture of experts to reduce active params, better kernels, KV Cache, pipeline parallelism, quantizations, <insert technique here> to make it more efficient.

Attention is costly, long context windows are costly, inference isn’t lightweight. But they scale in a highly predictable way. More parameters + more data + more compute → better performance, with relatively stable scaling curves. From an engineering perspective, that kind of predictability has significant value.\n\nAs long as marginal capability gains remain higher than marginal compute costs, scaling is not irrational. It’s an economic decision.\n\nWhat seems more interesting to me is that we’re no longer operating at the “one call = one response” level. Production systems today are often multi-step pipelines: RAG, tool calls, retries, fallback models, agent loops, reflection passes, etc. A single user request can trigger multiple inferences and large context usage.\n\nEven if base model efficiency improves by 20%, total system-level compute can still increase because workflows become more complex. Lower unit cost tends to increase usage. This is no longer purely a model efficiency problem — it’s an allocation problem at the system level.\n\nMany teams still default to routing most tasks to the largest available model, even when parts of the workflow could be handled by a smaller model or a deterministic component. That’s not really about architectural elegance. It’s about compute routing.\n\nI’m not convinced the main bottleneck is “find a radically new architecture tomorrow.” It may be more about optimizing compute allocation across models, tasks, and constraints at the system layer. Scaling looks excessive if you isolate the model, but less so when you look at the entire infrastructure stack.\n\nAre people here actually measuring cost per workflow rather than just cost per token?",

Recent LLM systems are more than capable of making a call to an API in an orderly manner if the API schema and (not totally necessary) the API docs are available.  This is due to both better reasoning performance, better tool calling and code execution abilities.  In fact a reasonable, context-saving approach is to ask a recent LLM to provide a parameterized prompt snippet to make a particular call and then provide those snippets as a library of available calls to your agents in future. Less context use, faster predictable calls and less security vulnerability hunting.",

      "text": "I’ve been trying to sharpen my intuition about large language models and I’d genuinely appreciate input from people who work in ML or have a strong technical background. I’m not looking for hype or anti-AI rhetoric, just a sober technical discussion.\n\nHere’s what I keep circling around:\n\nLLMs are trained on next-token prediction. At the most fundamental level, the objective is to predict the next word given previous context. That means the training paradigm is imitation. The system is optimized to produce text that statistically resembles the text it has seen before. So I keep wondering: if the objective is imitation, isn’t the best possible outcome simply a very good imitation? In other words, something that behaves as if it understands, while internally just modeling probability distributions over language?\n\nWhen people talk about “emergent understanding,” I’m unsure how to interpret that. Is that a real structural property of the model, or are we projecting understanding onto a system that is just very good at approximating linguistic structure?\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is memorization versus generalization. We know there are documented cases of LLMs reproducing copyrighted text, reconstructing code snippets from known repositories, or instantly recognizing classic riddles and bias tests. That clearly demonstrates that memorization exists at non-trivial levels. My question is: how do we rigorously distinguish large-scale memorization from genuine abstraction? When models have hundreds of billions of parameters and are trained on massive internet-scale corpora, how confident are we that scaling is producing true generalization rather than a more distributed and statistically smoothed form of memorization?\n\nThis connects to overfitting and double descent. Classical ML intuition would suggest that when model capacity approaches or exceeds dataset complexity, overfitting becomes a serious concern. Yet modern deep networks, including LLMs, operate in highly overparameterized regimes and still generalize surprisingly well. The double descent phenomenon suggests that after the interpolation threshold, performance improves again as capacity increases further. I understand the empirical evidence for double descent in various domains, but I still struggle with what that really means here. Is the second descent genuinely evidence of abstraction and structure learning, or are we simply in a regime of extremely high-dimensional interpolation that looks like generalization because the data manifold is densely covered?\n\nThen there’s the issue of out-of-distribution behavior. In my own experiments, when I formulate problems that are genuinely new, not just paraphrased or slightly modified from common patterns, models often start to hallucinate or lose coherence. Especially in mathematics or formal reasoning, if the structure isn’t already well represented in the training distribution, performance degrades quickly. Is that a fundamental limitation of text-only systems? Is it a data quality issue? A scaling issue? Or does it reflect the absence of a grounded world model?\n\nThat leads to the grounding problem more broadly. Pure language models have no sensorimotor interaction with the world. They don’t perceive, manipulate, or causally intervene in physical systems. They don’t have multimodal grounding unless explicitly extended. Can a system trained purely on text ever develop robust causal understanding, or are we mistaking linguistic coherence for a world model? When a model explains what happens if you tilt a table and a phone slides off, is it reasoning about physics or statistically reproducing common narrative patterns about objects and gravity?\n\nI’m also curious about evaluation practices. With web-scale datasets, how strictly are training and evaluation corpora separated? How do we confidently prevent benchmark contamination when the training data is effectively “the internet”? In closed-source systems especially, how much of our trust relies on company self-reporting? I’m not implying fraud, but the scale makes rigorous guarantees seem extremely challenging.\n\nThere’s also the question of model size relative to data. Rough back-of-the-envelope reasoning suggests that the total volume of publicly available text on the internet is finite and large but not astronomically large compared to modern parameter counts. Given enough capacity, is it theoretically possible for models to internally encode enormous portions of the training corpus? Are LLMs best understood as knowledge compressors, as structure learners, or as extremely advanced semantic search systems embedded in a generative architecture?\n\nBeyond the technical layer, I think incentives matter. There is massive economic pressure in this space. Investment cycles, competition between companies, and the race narrative around AGI inevitably shape communication. Are there structural incentives that push capability claims upward? Even without malicious intent, does the funding environment bias evaluation standards or public framing?\n\nFinally, I wonder how much of the perceived intelligence is psychological. Humans are extremely prone to anthropomorphize coherent language. If a system speaks fluently and consistently, we instinctively attribute intention and understanding. To what extent is the “wow factor” a cognitive illusion on our side rather than a deep ontological shift on the model’s side?\n\nAnd then there’s the resource question. Training and deploying large models consumes enormous computational and energy resources. Are we seeing diminishing returns masked by scale? Is the current trajectory sustainable from a systems perspective?\n\nSo my core question is this: are modern LLMs genuinely learning abstract structure in a way that meaningfully transcends interpolation, or are we observing extremely sophisticated statistical pattern completion operating in an overparameterized double descent regime that happens to look intelligent?\n\nI’d really appreciate technically grounded perspectives. Not hype, not dismissal, just careful reasoning from people who’ve worked close to these systems.",

Personally, I've always liked Hofstadter's takes on AI such as those in \"I am a strange loop\". I doubt you'll find much better answers to \"what even is generalization\" than in his writing(GEB and \"Surfaces and Essences\" are also great!).  \n  \nBut although he was initially skeptical of LLMs, he has changed his tone a bit in these past few years to start to question if the recursive elements present in LLMs has hit a turning point where we should be questioning what it is that we've created: [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kAmgdEjq2eYQkB5PP/douglas-hofstadter-changes-his-mind-on-deep-learning-and-ai](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kAmgdEjq2eYQkB5PP/douglas-hofstadter-changes-his-mind-on-deep-learning-and-ai)\n\nMy own 2 cents: There is something to LLMs beyond just memorization, but its constrained still in a way that differs from how our own brains are constrained(Ultimately, our own ability to generalize is still subject to limits). I might even go as far as to say that I'd consider LLMs to be \"capable of consciousness\" to some extent - although I don't think I'd say that they are \"alive\". They are in a weird space where all of our definitions start to break down and are severely lacking nuance to describe the variety of possible forms of cognition. Similar things happen when you really peel back the layers between different forms of animal minds and compare them with human ones, but this is even weirder.",

          "text": "1. The \"World Model\" vs. High-Dimensional Interpolation You asked if models are genuinely learning abstract structure or just operating in an overparameterized interpolation regime. The consensus among interpretability researchers (looking at things like mechanistic interpretability and induction heads) is: It’s both, but leaning heavily toward sophisticated interpolation. LLMs do learn abstract representations. They don't just memorize strings of text; they build latent features for concepts (e.g., a \"gender\" direction, a \"formality\" vector, or coding syntax trees). To predict the next token efficiently across petabytes of data, the network must compress the data. And the best way to compress data is to discover the underlying generative rules. However, this does not equal a causal \"World Model.\" When the model describes a phone sliding off a tilted table, it is not running a physics engine in its latent space. It is navigating the semantic topology of how humans talk about physics. This is why LLMs fail so catastrophically on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) reasoning, spatial tasks, or novel math. If the solution isn't densely represented in the training manifold, the model cannot extrapolate. It can only interpolate. \n\n2. Memorization vs. Abstraction (The Double Descent Reality) You brought up double descent. In the overparameterized regime, models perfectly fit the training data (memorization) and then find the \"simplest\" function that interpolates between those points (generalization). But here is the dirty secret of modern LLMs: the training data is so massive that the \"data manifold\" covers almost every common human thought. What looks like zero-shot generalization to us is often just the model finding a latent bridge between two memorized concepts. It is \"generalizing,\" but strictly within the convex hull of human internet text. \n\n3. The Benchmark Contamination Crisis You asked: \"How strictly are training and evaluation corpora separated?\" They aren't. This is the biggest open secret in the industry right now. With web-scale scraping, almost every classic riddle, math problem, and coding test is in the training data. Companies try to de-duplicate and filter, but it is practically impossible to prevent \"data leakage\" entirely. Many \"emergent capabilities\" reported in 2023 were later debunked as the models simply having seen the test set during training. This is why closed-source claims must be taken with a massive grain of salt.\n\n 4. The Anthropomorphic Illusion & Incentives Your point about the ELIZA effect (anthropomorphism) is the psychological engine driving the current hype cycle. We are evolutionarily hardwired to attribute consciousness to fluent language. When an LLM uses the word \"I\", our brains immediately project a mind onto it. Combine this cognitive bias with the VC funding environment, and you get a toxic incentive structure. Companies are incentivized to frame sophisticated statistical pattern-matching as \"sparks of AGI\" because that unlocks billions in computing budgets. If they admitted, \"We built a lossy, trillion-parameter semantic search engine,\" the valuations would crash. The Conclusion To answer your core question: Modern LLMs are highly advanced, lossy knowledge compressors. They do learn structural abstractions of language (grammar, tone, logic structures), but they use these structures to perform statistical pattern completion. \n\nThey lack grounded causality, they cannot reliably extrapolate outside their training distribution, and their \"reasoning\" is a simulation driven by the linguistic shadows of human thought. It is a breathtaking engineering achievement, but your intuition is correct: we are largely confusing linguistic coherence for ontological intelligence. Keep pulling on these threads. The industry needs this level of skepticism right now.",

          "text": ">In other words, something that behaves as if it understands, while internally just modeling probability distributions over language?\n\nI think “behaves as if it understands” isn’t really distinguishable from mimicking language patterns in general. So as the better the models get at generating language similar to the training set it will inevitably sound more human and as though it understands. \n\n>are we projecting understanding onto a system that is just very good at approximating linguistic structure?\n\nPartly that but the models do seem to have properties that seem to imply they are doing more than simply spewing back  training material. One thing that struck me early is how well llms seem to be able to rhyme and so if you ask it for a song it will create awful doggrel but it does rhyme. Hard to square the behaviour without thinking that it must in some sense be storing information about the sounds of words along with meaning and is able to invoke this in certain contexts. Not sure this has to be understanding but it’s related and seems deeper than the stochastic parrot caricature  \n\n>Or does it reflect the absence of a grounded world model? \n\nI would maybe characterise the optimistic view as being if you feed a big enough model enough data it will work out something near a world model itself but as you point out memoization is also happening and what seems to be tough is to encourage good world model building. Training purely for next word probably is close to diminishing returns \n\n>are modern LLMs genuinely learning abstract structure in a way that meaningfully transcends interpolation, or are we observing extremely sophisticated statistical pattern completion operating in an overparameterized double descent regime that happens to look intelligent? \n\nThere seems to be something more than straight interpolation going on, but not enough to make me think AGI is just around the corner",

          "text": "I think your perspective is based on how GPT-3 (circa 2022) was trained. Saying that LLMs do just next token prediction implies that pre-training is the only thing that matters. \n\nWe have gone through 4 distinct phases in post training since then\n- RLHF\n- structured json grammars\n- test-time search\n- (now) reinforcement learning on tool call sequences\n\nThis should make your question a lot simpler. Next token predictor GPT-3 still felt like BERT. Models today are so different. The above list I gave is like the top highlights of post training, there’s a lot more going on that we prolly don’t even know. World models are being actively used to do better RL for agents right now for example.\n\nI think to understand pre-training you have to understand DPO. Next token prediction captured a lot of interesting behaviors in hard to elicit ways. Everything after has been a slow grind of finding the right eval harness and collect enough data to make that micro-behavior a macro-behavior through painstaking manual effort and hopefully some synthetic generation hacks. \n\nAs for true generalization, my only metric for that is how much revenue will Anthropic print per sector of the economy. I am an empiricist and I think the free markets will let you know if things are generalizing or not. It’s easy to fall for investor posturing optics so you really have to dig to know if they are. Anthropic for the most part has been honest in their communications based on what I have seen on the ground, other labs don’t share as much as them. \n\nThis question is much better suited for r/mlscaling - you’ll get better answers there. Model training is a gated profession so us LLM Devs can just conjecture and hope the next models just work. Evals went out the window in mid 2025 so it’s all just vibes here now. Learning theory and all that is tech we hope the labs figure out.",

GPT-5.2 at low reasoning scores 0.604. That is not a rounding error and it has real cost implications for anyone running at scale.\n\nAt high reasoning it ties Gemini 3 Pro Preview at the top of our leaderboard with 0.719 overall, ahead of GPT-5.2 high at 0.649.\n\nHallucination resistance hits 0.921, the highest of any model we have tested. Gemini 3 Pro sits at 0.820, GPT-5.2 at 0.655. Social calibration at 0.905 and error detection at 0.848 are similarly the best we have seen.\n\nTo give credit where it is due, Gemini 3 Pro is still the better call for hard science. Philosophy 0.900 vs 0.767, chemistry 0.839 vs 0.710, economics 0.812 vs 0.750. It is not a sweep.\n\nThe honest caveat is sycophancy resistance at 0.716 is actually slightly below Sonnet 4.5 at high reasoning which scored 0.755. For a company that talks about this a lot, that is worth watching.\n\nIf reliability and hallucination resistance are your primary eval criteria nothing beats it right now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tj3yyj5t5bkg1.png?width=2588&format=png&auto=webp&s=260eac02f897164ffda778e0f332fe2b6df92890\n\n",

For any application where the model is making recommendations or surfacing information to end users, hallucination is a trust killer that is hard to recover from.\n\nThe sycophancy regression is worth flagging though. In ad-adjacent applications where you are trying to get honest signal from a model about user intent, a model that agrees too readily is actually worse than one that pushes back. Curious if your benchmark breaks that down by prompt type at all.\n\nThe cost angle you raised on non-reasoning Sonnet beating GPT-5.2 with reasoning is underrated. At scale that is not just a cost story, it is a latency story too. What does the benchmark show on response consistency across runs?",

It honestly feels like these coding agents hit a ceiling because they can’t verify if adding more compute actually improves the output quality or just burns tokens. We started using a proper eval pipeline to monitor how the subagents were actually performing across different dataset sizes and it helped us catch where the logic was stalling. It really made the whole debugging process a lot smoother once we integrated Confident AI.",
