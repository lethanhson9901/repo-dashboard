          "text": "You are missing a key part of Costco’s model: \nThey turnover product in under 30 days. Sometimes twice in 30 days depending on the product. They turnover their entire store in 30 days. Given that most terms for buying product are net30, the companies that are selling Costco products to sell, are effectively financing them. \n\nCostco has a ridiculously low sku count so people generally have one choice, not two. They work with their partners to get some advantage for their members. If the price of cocoa goes up, they go to their mfg and allow them to raise the price to cover that increase. But when the cost of cocoa goes down, you better believe they are making sure the mfg is lowering the price again. It goes both ways. They are partners. \n\nWith the categories you are describing, you can’t get what has made Costco work. For virtually every category you mentioned, people want choice. And with choice, there’s no volume. Costco buys in palettes. Your categories are one off purchases with considerable time in between purchases. \n\nIf you are thinking partners like the Costco auto program, I don’t think the clientele you want are bargain shopping and looking for ways to save money on houses, cars, vacations. If you are talking about a concierge service that will navigate these things for people, I pretty sure it already exists. \n\nJust my $.02",

Member governance ensures that the activities of the ecosystem serve the stakeholders and an internal micro-economy allows members and business entities to operate freely internally, while satisfying tax liabilities at the organizational level. Secondary market liquidity supports buy-in and exit at individual levels, while the funds cycle perpetually to support multi-generational wealth preservation while producing social and ecological impact.\n\nIf you want to learn more about groups and individuals working on this, DM me and I'll point you to some references.",

      "text": "I used to believe the hardest part of building a startup was coming up with a completely original idea. Every new concept felt exciting at first, but most of them fell apart once I tried to imagine real customers paying for them.\n\nRecently, while browsing StartupIdeas DB (i came across it on google) I noticed something interesting. Many of the most compelling businesses weren’t novel at all. They were existing ideas executed better, adapted to a new niche, or brought to a different market. In hindsight, this pattern shows up everywhere once you start looking for it.\n\nCopying gets a bad reputation, but most successful startups are really just proven businesses with a twist. Sometimes the twist is better UX, sometimes pricing, sometimes distribution, and sometimes geography. Very few are truly “from scratch” innovations.\n\nBuilding something completely new often means educating customers, validating demand the hard way, and making expensive mistakes no one else has made yet. Copying a business that already works shifts the challenge from “will this idea work?” to “can I execute better or differently?”, which feels like a much more solvable problem.\n\nI’m curious how others here think about this. Have you had more success innovating versus adapting? Where do you draw the line between copying and learning? And do you have examples of unoriginal ideas that worked surprisingly well for you?",

Something that feels obvious or easy to us can be genuinely painful or confusing for others.\n\nFor example, I am good with ideas and communication, but I am terrible at math. \n\nSomeone could sell me a calculator far more easily than they could sell me an AI agent that does what I already do. \n\nValue shows up where ability is missing.\n\nA lot of founders spend time and energy stressing themselves out trying to find their market. \n\nWe ask each other, create echo chambers, and reinforce our own assumptions, when the better move might be to step outside our bubble and identify the group of people who are naturally bad at the thing we are offering. Those people feel the problem most often, and they are the ones actively looking for relief.\n\nThat is your market.

Use your own physical office address as the registered agent to avoid extra costs. Skip the services unless you want privacy or compliance help.​\n\nNow lets do a DIY vs. Service comparison: \n\n\\- DIY works better for straightforward setups like yours.   \nServices are convenient for handling paperwork, errors, and ongoing filings, especially if you're new or a busy person like me :) \n\nSince you need a registered agent anyway (must have a physical in-state address), paying upfront for a full service often saves you the hassle long-term. However, the DIY keeps it under $350 total for the first year in Texas. Nevada's higher fees make it pricier overall. \n\nWhich is why I'd pick Texas if I were in your place. ",

Everything I read says Delaware is the gold standard (Court of Chancery, VC friendly), but I’m getting wildly different advice on how to actually form the thing.\n\nMy cousin (who is a paralegal, not a corporate lawyer) is scaring me saying that if I don't have a lawyer draft the Operating Agreement, the online templates will leave me wide open for personal liability if I ever get sued. She mentioned something about piercing the corporate veil and how most of these online services don't actually handle the foreign qualification if I'm not living in DE (I’m based in Austin, TX).\n\nWhat's a cheap and fast way to form an LLC in Delaware for a project that's started generating some monthly income? I'm looking for legit options that won't hit me with unnecessary upsells or hourly charges. Any advice on how to handle this efficiently? I need a solution to complete the set up online. \n\nLawyer quoted me $2,500 for a \"startup package.\" This feels like a massive chunk of my bootstrap budget just for some paperwork.\n\nFor those who used an online service, did it ever come back to bite you when you tried to raise money or open a bank account? Has anyone actually had a \"standard\" Operating Agreement fail them in a legal dispute?  \n  \nI really don't want to spend $2k+ if I don't have to, but I also don't want to save $1,500 now only to lose the whole company later because of a typo in a template.  \n",

Delaware vs Texas Delaware only really matters early if you are actively planning a VC-style raise soon. If you are just selling and staying lean, a Texas LLC is often simpler and cheaper. If you form in Delaware but actually operate from Texas, you will likely still need to register as a foreign LLC in Texas and keep up with both states’ compliance.\n2. Operating Agreement and “piercing the veil” A template Operating Agreement is not what usually makes or breaks liability protection. Veil piercing is more about behavior: commingling funds, no separate bank account, sloppy bookkeeping, signing contracts personally, undercapitalization, ignoring formalities. A solid but standard OA plus clean ops typically gets you most of the benefit.\n3. Bank account and fundraising Banks mainly care about formation docs, EIN, and who controls the company. Investors care more about clean cap table, IP assignment, and the ability to convert to a Delaware C-corp later if needed.\n\nCheap and fast setup: file the Delaware certificate, get EIN, open a business bank account, adopt a basic OA, then do Texas foreign registration if you stick with Delaware. BusinessAnywhere can handle the filings/admin side if you want it streamlined without law firm rates. For anything complex (multiple owners, investors, unusual profit splits), that is when paying a real lawyer is worth it.",

You can still form an NM LLC and list a different mailing address, as long as the registered agent address is in New Mexico.\n\nHow much mail do they actually handle? Usually not much. Most freelancers will only see occasional state notices and, in the rare case something goes sideways, service of process. The main value is that someone is always there to receive time-sensitive documents and get them to you quickly.\n\nIf you want a simple option that’s built for remote founders, [BusinessAnywhere Registered Agent](https://businessanywhere.io/registered-agent-service/) covers the NM registered agent requirement and forwards notices digitally.",

I'm trying to decide if I should just list myself as the Registered Agent or if I should actually pay for a service.\n\nI really want to list myself as the RA since I meet all the requirements and I need this business address listed somewhere officially connecting it to my business. I'm asking this question because it's a dilemma because of something that happened with a friend and need more people's advice on what to do.   \n  \nSo this friend of mine started a small consulting gig last year and decided to be his own agent to save money. Long story short, he went on a much-needed camping trip for a week where he had zero cell service. That was the exact window when a legal notice regarding a minor contract dispute was delivered to his house. Because he wasn't there to sign for it and accept service, things got messy with the court dates, and he ended up paying way more in legal fees to fix the default than he ever would have spent on a registered agent.\n\nI get that this should convince me to get a registered agent service and I shouldn't be asking over here, but is does this happen frequently or my guy got extra unlucky?\n\nAnd also, what's everyone seeing for pricing? Most of the sites I’ve looked at seem to be in the $100 to $300 per year range, but I’ve seen some introductory offers for $50 that jump up later. Are there any hidden fees I should watch out for?",

The normal range is \\~$100–$300/yr. Watch for intro offers that renew higher, auto-renew traps, and upsells like mail scanning/forwarding, compliance packages, or per-document fees.\n\nRule of thumb: if you travel, work odd hours, or want privacy, just hire the service.

I have a background in quality assurance and improvement and would like to start this program as soon as I graduate. EMS in my area and as a whole is burning out medics through predatory QA departments and I have a program that teaches how to approach QA to improve providers not make them fear QA and leave the profession. This business would cover implementation of the new QA program, staff training, personal attendance to 3 QAQI meetings, data and analytics training. I would then be on a retainer for large sentinel events and other consulting needs. My research has shown this as a pretty untapped niche and pricing goals would be 20k for start up training and implementation followed by a 4k per month retainer that would scale up and down depending on department size and need. I believe this could easily hit 7 figures within two years. Any advice is appreciated thank you.",

          "text": "Hey guys,\n\nSo I have been working on a side project that would help people when it comes to their mental health. It's a tool designed to provide people with the means of dealing with whatever mental struggles they're experiencing in a private and safe way. The tool is called Haven.\n\nHaven is an AI desktop companion that uses the Ollama LLM model to remain private and localized in your computer. It is completely local and offline. There are no external API's or services that are connected to the internet. It's essentially a chat box that is completely black boxed. Haven will respond to your texts in real time and remember several contextual information you provide it but will forget everything as soon as you close it. It's also designed to begin forgetting the conversation as the conversation continues.\n\nIn short, nothing you write ever leaves your computer. It's simply just you, your thoughts, and Haven. There's no way for me to even see how Haven is being used except through a feedback box that is embedded in the Haven application. Again, Haven is completely free and I intend to keep it free forever. If you're curious and want to use Haven, you can download it from my website here: [https://prometheussys.com](https://prometheussys.com/)\n\nIf you do end up installing it, I would very much appreciate if you can provide me with feedback on Haven. The goal is to improve this companion so that it can better address people's mental health struggles. It is also important to note that Haven was never designed to replace an actual professional but to be a tool in a person's toolbox when it comes to dealing with mental health struggles.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and thank you in advance for considering Haven.",

I’m planning to start small from home, focusing on handcrafted quality rather than mass production.\n\nTo manage startup costs, I’m considering sourcing packaging, molds, and basic equipment from Alibaba, while keeping ingredients fresh and locally sourced. Alongside this, I think building a strong online presence early will be key. My plan is to use Instagram, TikTok, and possibly a simple website to showcase the chocolate-making process, highlight the Dubai-inspired theme, take small orders, and test demand before scaling.\n\nInitially, I’d offer a limited range of products like bars, truffles, and filled chocolates, reinvesting profits as the brand grows.\n\nI’d love advice on whether the homemade chocolate market is too saturated and if Dubai-themed branding actually helps stand out.\n\n I’d also appreciate tips on setting up an online presence early and pricing a small but premium-style chocolate brand.",

Of course it depends where you are and what are your shipping costs.

You need to have separate place or at least separate room and you need to have your stuff checked. \n\nThen there is logistics.

The key is getting your first few clients quickly so you can prove yourself and build word-of-mouth. Start with neighbors, friends, and family; even one satisfied client can lead to multiple referrals. Flyers can work, but personal outreach and local Facebook groups or Nextdoor are usually more effective and free. You can also think about small complementary services: driveway salting, sidewalk clearing, or even lawn care in warmer months. That way, your business isn’t entirely seasonal. Pricing is usually per driveway or per hour don’t undersell yourself, especially if you do a great job. Have you mapped out which streets or neighborhoods you want to target first, or thought about how you’ll get clients?",

It often takes a long period of time to establish a customer base, a brand, systems, processes and in turn profit. Doing gig's on the other hand with like task rabbit etc is a way to almost bring in immediate income due to having a potential customer base there. Over the long term, you will take less though and don't essentially have a business, just an income which can be fine too. \n\nHowever, if building a business is more important, then you can absolutely start small and build something meaningful. Your capital is minimal, but so many service based businesses can be started with little capital, and lots of sweat equity. Like you mentioned, snow shovelling etc could work, it's seasonal however so finding services that align with this, but serve during the warmer months would be ideal. \n\nI would take a minute to write some things down that may interest you and look for ways that you could pursue that. You don't have to have a passion for what you do or love it, just a curiosity can often be enough. It could be pet grooming, dog walking, lawn care, personal training, aquarium tank cleaning, residential/ office cleaning, junk removal, meal prep....the list goes on. \n\nYou want to find a service that could be naturally recurring i.e. weekly cleaning, monthly car detailing etc.",

I like the idea of building something for myself, making my own decisions, and not always feeling like I’m working on someone else’s dream.\n\nAt the same time, I keep getting stuck in my own head. I have doubts about doing it alone. Not about the work itself, but about trusting myself enough to make the right calls, handle setbacks, and not freeze when things get hard. Some days I feel confident and motivated, other days I’m questioning if I’m even cut out for it or if I’m just romanticizing the idea.\n\nWhat messes with me is that I don’t know if this lack of confidence is just a normal part of the process or a sign that I’m not ready yet. I keep wondering if confidence is something you’re supposed to already have before starting, or if it’s something that only shows up once you’re actually in it.\n\nI guess I’m curious if anyone else has felt this way before starting their own thing. Did you push through the doubt, wait until you felt “ready,” or realize you needed a partner or some kind of safety net? Just trying to figure out if this feeling is part of the journey or something I should take seriously.",

Lack of confidence is very common (I wonder if the algo directed me to your post).  \n\nSome people suggest what you are feeling is due to \"limiting beliefs\" caused by some trauma or how you grew up.  While some of that may certainly exist for some people (not a psychologist), I think it comes down to lack of experience.  \n\nThose of us with experience are more willing to jump and take the risk because we have the confidence to figure things out as we go — even though we know we could still fail.\n\nNormally, you gain confidence through life experience and through practice. I like to say that practice builds confidence and confidence builds skills — and skills pay the bills.  \n\nWatching a bunch of videos on how to do business is not practice.  Buying a course that describes a business recipe is not practice.  \n\nSo when you start taking steps to start your business, you realize you are not sure what to do next — that's the lack of confidence due to lack of practice or experience.\n\nIMO the fastest way to gain this confidence is through simulated experience — ie, play business simulation games. Just like a pilot learns to fly an airplane with a flight simulator, it's possible to do the same with business.",

      "text": "Bit of an interesting situation I'm in. My father was an audio technician for almost 30 years. I started working with him when I was a little kid and really got into it when I was 14. He closed up shop during COVID after events shut down and he realized he was getting too old to be dragging 400 lbs of equipment and working til 4am every weekend. His old pa system is probably worth 15 - 20k and has just been in storage for the past 5 years.\n\nI gained 8 years of actual experience working with him between the time I was 14 and when he shut down. I know how to wire mics and speakers, mix live audio, use effects, etc. \n\nI'm kinda sick of working crappy jobs and have been kinda thinking about ways to leverage his equipment. Id pay him for it of course. Talk out a way to lease it from him or maybe buy it outright but here's my problem. \n\nBeing a roadie isn't very good money and it's a lot of work. It'd also require a truck which I don't have. I've been considering the idea of a recording studio but I live in Halifax which while having a decent local music scene, isn't exactly bussling with talent looking for a studio. And most of the bands here already have people they record with. Ive considered opening a venue but ik that actually leasing a space is prohibitively expensive and getting a liquor license isn't exactly easy. Plus operating a bar/club is something I have no idea about and I have no capital to get one started.\n\nJust trying to brainstorm ideas on what can be done here. Anybody know of anything else I can do?",
