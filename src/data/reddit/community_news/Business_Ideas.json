Have a few set hours and charge more for appointments outside those hours? Someone who lives close by? A mom or a bright teenager who could do homework when not busy? Or he or she could learn about local and on-line marketing and implement it during hours when no one shows? Maybe someone whose school or college could give them credit as an internship learning experience?      \n     I wonder if you'd consider adding some other products or services that would appeal to the same customers and add to your profit? Toys and kids' clothing? Maternity clothing? \n     Or one or more activities, maybe one day a week: Homework help? Math/engineering club? Lego club? \n     I realize you want to sell the business and let it go, and that might make the most sense. But it is easier to sell a profitable business. I couldn't help sharing my thoughts, but I realize they are a different direction. \n     Best wishes to you in whatever you pursue in the future!",

Text to audio itself is pretty crowded now, so the question is who this is for and when they would choose it over built in OS or browser features.\n\nI would pressure test the core use case. Is it for long form reading like PDFs and Substack, or for quick capture like photos and snippets? Those are very different behaviors and onboarding flows. Quality of voice matters, but so does friction. How many taps from link to listening, and does it remember context across sessions?\n\nIf you have early users, I would watch where they drop off. If people convert one thing and never come back, the value prop is probably too generic. Narrowing to one strong habit often works better than trying to cover every input type at once.",

Thing is, I have maybe 4 competitors, and stuff I sell minimum costs $25k, top range $220k. No one will share the industry and products that work for them. I sure as hell wouldn’t want to encourage competitor #5 to enter. I also have a heavy bias towards selling shit that costs at minimum $10K+. I can’t be bothered with anything less. I agree with what others said below; gotta think outside the box. I started out first as becoming a sales rep / dealer for a new manufacturer (they found out what I was doing to get leads and sales, and they kicked me out so they can go do it themselves). After throwing a pity party for 5 months, I later found an overseas manufacturer that wanted to break into USA market and I was able to become a distributor for their products (showed them my past track record when I sold the other mfg’s products) and it worked — signed an iron clad territory agreement, and the rest was history. That’s where I found success. Try finding small mfgs and becoming a sales rep for their line, and work out of their inventory. I guarantee it’ll work to get you some $$ in your pocket. And then you can start really thinking about which product line(s) you want to really go after, private label, etc to get higher margins. (Then can go visit factories, etc etc.) Word of caution for private labeling: insurance companies don’t insure those types of products because then they see you as the OEM and you’d need to get a completely different type of premium insurance and can be costly.",

Take notes, take your notes and take them to \"Claude Ai\" and tell it to make it a script for you.\n\nIf you are in the US, go on Zillow, start looking house listings in your area that have been up for over 100 days, and are listed as \"For Sale by Owner\". Get their number, call them an offer to buy their house for 50% of what they are asking for. \n\n\n99% of them will refuse of course, but that's going to teach you how to negotiate and handle Nos. For the one % that say yes, you can profit from them. If they say yes, tell them You're going to reach out to them in an hour or 2 when your attorney writes the Purchase Agreement Contract.\n\n\nAfter that you search up recently sold \"fully remodeled\" houses in the same area, (similar specifications).\n\nCall the listing agent and ask them if their client would be interested in buying a property you have under contract in the same area as his recently sold property for 60-70% ARV (you'll learn this lingo whilst you understand wholesaling). Make sure you give him a price above what you asked for. \n\n\n\nIf it's a good deal, he's gonna say yes, then you send the property to the seller, and after they sign it, you assign the contract to the buyer at a fee, then you keep the difference.\n\n\nThis is going teach you most of what you need to know in sales, and you can even make some serious money while doing it.\n\nTalking to Destressed sellers is harder than selling to someone with money, so expect it to be super frustrating when you're starting out.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also do this if you're not in the US, just get a US phone number.",

With that amount, you don’t have enough capital to buy inventory or run ads. If you spend it on a \"course\" or a \"system,\" you will lose it. Consider that money your emergency fund and keep it safe.\n\nYour only real asset right now isn't the cash—it's your time and the fact that you are in a lower-cost economy. This is actually your biggest advantage.\n\nYou need to learn a high-income digital skill that businesses in the US/EU are desperate for but can't find affordable local help for. I’m talking about:\n\n* Short-form video editing (Reels/TikToks)\n* Direct response copywriting\n* Basic data scraping or lead generation\n\nHere is the realistic path:\n\n1. Pick **one** of those skills.\n2. Spend the next 30 days learning it for free on YouTube. Do not pay for a course.\n3. Go to platforms like Upwork or even better, cold DM small business owners on Instagram/LinkedIn.\n4. Offer your service at a massive discount to get your first 3 reviews.\n\nYour goal is to earn $500–$1000 USD/month. In your country, that might put you in the top 10% of earners, but for a US business, it’s a cheap, easy expense to approve.\n\nThis isn't sexy. It’s 3–6 months of grinding for free before you see consistent money. But it’s the only path from zero that doesn’t involve gambling.\n\nStart today. Watch 10 tutorials on video editing. It costs you $0.",

If you have an idea that you think is worth building go for it, if it dosent work you go onto the next that’s what half the battle of being an entrepreneur is ‘failure’ find something you truly believe in and have fun with it. Also, don’t be afraid to network. There are so many ways to reach people who’ve been in your shoes , learning from others’ experiences is invaluable. And leverage tools like AI (or other AI assistants) to brainstorm, generate ideas, and even get guidance on next steps — what would take hours can now take minutes.\n\nThe most important thing is action and consistency. Start small, learn fast, fail fast, and build momentum. If you keep moving forward, you’ll eventually turn that small capital into something bigger, even from scratch. Just remember patience, persistence, and focus on learning will get you further than chasing shortcuts ever will.\n\nGood luck !",

For each country I’ve been to, I created very detailed PDF guides with popular and hidden spots, cultural tips, how to get around, and expectations vs. reality. I’ve always done this for fun and as a journal to remember my travels, but now I have a whole collection of guides just sitting on my computer.\n\nAfter telling a friend about it, she suggested I should sell them, since many people want to travel but don’t know how to plan it. I’m a very low-profile person and have never shared this online, but after some research I realized I could simply upload the guides to a platform and create an Instagram/TikTok profile to promote them.\n\nI’d love to get some feedback. I’m not expecting to make much money, but if this can bring in a few extra coins, I’d really appreciate it.",

          "text": "Qualifying customers has a lot of value. However, you have a couple misconceptions. \n\n>most of the time they pick creators based on followers or vibes\n\nMost big brands have far more sophisticated metrics than \"vibes\". There are a million formulas & approaches used to determine who might be the best influencer for a given product. \n\nThe reason you think it's \"most\" is because the brands you hear the most are mass-market direct to consumer brands like SurfShark or Delete Me that are simply trying to carpet-bomb the market. These are mass market plays, not surgical precision plays. *They* don't need qualitative data. \n\n>So I built a way to analyze influencer comment sections to find which creators have the highest % of people actively asking things like: “Does this work?” “Where do I buy?” “Is this good for acne?”\n\nSo you built an AI agent that reviews comments. How do you validate your predictions? You tell me that the audience of Influencer X is far more likely to be ready to buy my product. How do you ever show it to be true, even in retrospect? \n\nAdditionally, why would an influencer audience's \"readiness to buy\" sunscreen mean they were more likely to buy my new sunglasses or phone accessory or tax service? Readiness to buy is product specific. If Influencer X has ads promoting a sunscreen and your software says, \"Influencer X's audience wants sunscreen!\" then what do I do with that information? They are more ready to buy *because* they have seen the ads of my competitor. It's extremely unlikely that that influencer will be contractually permitted to promote *MY* sunscreen at that point. \n\nLastly, how would this product deal with changes to social media policy or TOS. Twitter used to allow you to harvest all the data associated with public accounts. Now it doesn't. Your crawlers will be flagged quickly as your business scales. This data always has to be up to date—nobody is going to pay for weeks old data.",

They don't need a million formulas; they need curated, high-intent options.\n\nOn 'Readiness to Buy': High intent on a competitor's post (e.g., asking 'Does this work for acne?') is the strongest buying signal there is. It means they are problem-aware and solution-seeking but undecided. That is exactly where a challenger brand wins.\n\nOn 'Validation': I’m not selling predictive analytics software; I’m selling an outcome.

It means they are problem-aware and solution-seeking but undecided. That is exactly where a challenger brand wins.\n\nIf Influencer X is already talking about Acne Cream A, it does Acne Cream B no good to know that his audience is problem-aware and solution-seeking because that influencer can't **also** sign with their competing acne cream. It's incredibly rare for influencer agreements not to include some minimal level of exclusivity or affiliate commissions. \n\nHow would your product work if the influencer isn't *already* pitching a product? It seems like a Catch 22: it tells you your competitor is *about* to succeed or lets you know the ground isn't fertile. \n\n>On 'Validation': I’m not selling predictive analytics software; I’m selling an outcome. The validation is simple: I send them the influencers, they run the campaign. If ROAS is positive, the model works.\n\nI get pitched on a million products per year. I can tell you that the ones that require me to invest in them to validate the concept make up almost 0% of my marketing stack. I need data and white pages and evidence to justify investment. That will be a big hurdle to get around. \n\nWill you be giving out freebees? \n\n>On APIs/Scale: This is internal infrastructure to power a service business, not a public-facing crawler.\n\nMaybe I'm not following your concept here. I assumed you were an ongoing service. Are you selling software that businesses deploy and use themselves? Otherwise, I'm not following the difference between a public and non-public crawler. They're both still beholden to TOS. Since Meta, TikTok, and every other platform already have official or unofficial Influencer agencies, it seems like they'd want to shut you down. \n\n>You’re looking at this through a Product Manager lens (Scalability/TOS), which is fair. I’m looking at it through a Sales lens (Revenue/Conversion). For now, the latter pays the bills\n\nIf you are at the \"validate my idea\" phase, there are **no** bills being paid, right now. SaaS products are attractive because the logistics scale downward. If you're dealing with ChatGPT tokens and per-business scrapers, your business doesn't scale like an SaaS, it scales like a service. That's certainly not a bad thing, but it's not about project management or conversion, it's about modeling future earnings. \n\nOn a slightly different note, have you considered your software as an attribution toolset for advertisers? Influencer campaigns are notoriously hard to track—I could see there being value in a simple tool that automates the tracking of sentiment on a post-by-post basis to hone messaging?",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nHappy New Year. Hope 2026 has started well for all of you.\n\nI’m currently building a managed home services platform that owns pricing, execution standards, and customer outcomes, using vetted providers as supply. This is not a free-form marketplace. The product, operating model, and groundwork are already in motion. What I’m now looking for is the right person to take real ownership over growth and early execution alongside me.\n\nI’ve spent the last 15 years working hands-on in property maintenance and residential environments in London. I’ve seen how jobs actually get quoted, delayed, under-delivered, and argued over in the real world, not just how platforms say they work. That experience is the reason this isn’t being built as a typical marketplace. The failures are structural, not marketing-related, and the model reflects that.\n\nHome services is a massive, fragmented market. In London alone, it’s worth billions annually. Demand is not the problem. The problems are trust, reliability, pricing clarity, and operational consistency. That’s where most platforms fail, and that’s exactly where we’re building differently.\n\nThe model is deliberately simple and execution-driven. Clear pricing, no bidding wars, no race to the bottom, and no vanity metrics. The focus is completed jobs, happy customers, reliable providers, and unit economics that actually make sense.\n\nWe’ll be starting with a geographically focused launch in London to build proper density before expanding. How you think about early traction, how you convert demand into real completed work, and how you build operational discipline early matters far more than buzzwords or theory.\n\nI’m already speaking with candidates through multiple channels, including YCombinator’s co-founder matching, and I’m being very selective about who I spend time with. This is an equity-based role with real ownership and responsibility from day one. It’s not an advisory position and not a short-term engagement.\n\nI’m looking for someone who wants genuine co-founder-level ownership across growth and operations. Someone comfortable in messy early stages, willing to move fast, test channels, speak directly to customers and providers, and be accountable for outcomes, not just ideas.\n\nIf this resonates, send me a DM with your LinkedIn and include the following:\n\n- How you would approach the first phase.\n- Where you would start within London and why. \n- How you would get the first real customers and ensure jobs actually get completed. \n- Which acquisition channels you would test first. \n- What success would look like in the initial phase.\n\nThis probably isn’t a fit if you’re only looking to advise or if you’re uncomfortable with hands-on execution early on.\n\nIf there’s mutual fit, I’m happy to share more detail privately.\n\nRegardless of whether this resonates or not, hope you have a great year ahead!\n\n- Eddie",

As many others I spend alot of time thinking about new ideas and trying things to see if something work. Lately I have mostly felt stuck in my head though, brain fog or block or whatever you want to call it and have many times thought that it would be nice to have somebody to juggle ideas with and maybe come up with and execute on something together. I think having two heads, two sets of 24 hours would be much more beneficial and much more fun as well!\n\nIf there is anybody who is driven & a \"go-getter\" like me out there feel free to reach out to me, would love to have a chat. I don't really care who you are, how old you are or where you live, although I am based in Europe myself so being more or less the same time difference would be more convenient. ",

And sometimes the right move is staying home and thinking. None of that means you’re stuck. You can’t get dopamine from everything. Real progress takes time.\n\nWhat matters is knowing exactly where you stand in the current snapshot of your life. One bad decision can wipe out a business model for years. \n\nMost people don’t get stuck because they lack ideas. They get stuck because ideas without structure turn into noise. That brain fog usually comes from thinking in circles instead of building something small and concrete.\n\nTwo heads can be powerful, but only if there’s clarity. Clear roles. Clear time commitment. Clear upside. Otherwise it’s just another noise. \n\nWhat actually works is stepping back and categorizing industries and what type of world we live in. Look at where real demand sits, which problems repeat, and then build a small working network around those lanes. Collective work beats solo guessing, but only when everyone knows what they own and how they contribute.\n\nIf you’re serious, start with three things.

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a solo founder based in Switzerland. I have zero formal coding experience, but over the last few months, I’ve \"vibe coded\" a platform called anewera.ch\n\nIt’s a sandbox-based AI agent builder—conceptually similar to Manus—and I built it because I needed it for my own workflows. Now that the agent space is exploding (with Meta's recent acquisition of Manus), I realize I’ve built something that could be a serious business, but I have zero users and no experience in scaling a SaaS.\n\nWhat the platform does right now:\n\n• Full Sandbox: It writes code and executes/deploys it in a secure environment.\n\n• MCP Server Integration: Connects to any MCP server, like Gmail, Google Sheets, etc.\n\n• Complex Workflows: It can do deep research -> web scraping -> create a landing page -> send a beautiful HTML email summary -> save results to a Sheet.\n\n• Long-Running Agents: You can tell it: \"Read my emails every day at 10 AM and make me a summary,\" and it just works.\n\n• File Handling: Native support for Excel, PDFs, and Docs.\n\nThe Situation:\n\nBecause I built this entirely through \"vibe coding\" without being a professional developer, there are definitely bugs here and there. The core engine is powerful and works, but it needs a professional touch to become a polished product.\n\nI’ve handled the product vision and the initial build alone. Now, I’m looking for a partner—ideally someone with a background in running a SaaS, marketing, or business operations—who wants to help me turn this from a powerful personal tool into a real product.\n\nI am based in Switzerland and would love to find someone who is excited about the AI Agent space to join me.\n\nIf you want to see a demo or chat about potentially joining forces, let’s talk.\n\nCheck it out here: https://anewera.ch",

      "text": "I’m testing a local business idea and looking for honest feedback, especially from people who’ve run public events or pop-ups.\n\nThe idea is a weekend, walk-through used car fair for private sellers only (no dealerships). Sellers drop off their cars at a secure parking lot for the weekend. Buyers can walk the lot, look at multiple cars in one place, and contact sellers directly. No commissions, no auctions, no pressure. Think farmers market format, but for used cars.\n\n**Why I think this is needed:**\n\nPrivate car sales today mostly happen through Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, etc., which a lot of people now associate with flaky buyers, scams, safety concerns, and wasted time. On the other end, many buyers are actively avoiding dealerships because of markups, pressure tactics, and lack of trust. This idea is meant to sit in the middle: real private sellers, real cars, in a public and organized setting.\n\nThis isn’t a brand-new concept — it’s based on the Sierra College Auto Fair model, which has been running successfully in California for years. I’m looking to bring a similar setup to my town.\n\n**How it would make money:**\n\nSellers pay a flat fee to display their car for the weekend. Buyers attend for free. The event doesn’t take a cut of the sale—just charges for access, organization, and exposure.\n\nThe biggest challenge I’m running into is finding a parking lot to rent. I’ve reached out to schools, churches, office parks, and other underused lots for weekend use. Most either don’t respond or seem hesitant because of liability, permits, or just not wanting to deal with it.\n\n**I’d love feedback on two things:**\n\n\t1.\tThe idea itself — does this solve a real problem, or is there an obvious flaw I’m missing?\n\n\t2.\tThe logistics — if you’ve hosted pop-ups, car shows, food truck events, or community fairs:\n\n\t•\tWhat type of property owner was most open?\n\n\t•\tWhat objections came up most often?\n\n\t•\tWhat helped you get a “yes”?\n\nIf this wouldn’t work, what’s the most likely reason it fails?\n\nAnd would you personally trust an event like this as a buyer or a seller?\n\nThanks again in advance for your time and input!

And there are several streams of income you could find within this business model.\n\n  \nHowever, you are already calling businesses to use their land.  And yet you don't have a business or credentials in place, correct?  That's why you are having a hard time with this item.\n\nIn my opinion, you need to do your \"homework\" before you start.  Here are my recommendations, assuming you live in a city and state in the USA.\n\n1.  Look up the community colleges in your state and find a hospitality program.  Ideally, you would want to earn a 2-year degree.  At a minimum, you would earn a CCL.  With a concentration on event management.  In theory, this program will teach you about liability, zoning, taxes and fees, as well as event management and hospitality laws.\n\n2. Obtain a real estate license for your state.  This will provide you with a basic understanding of leases, contracts, zoning, and property use laws.  This will also equip you with the skills to research property and business owners.  \n\n\n3. Locate a business attorney who services your area to determine the property entity formation and tax classification for your business.  Hopefully, this attorney will also point you to insurance companies that can help you with this type of business.\n\n4. Reach out to the SBA for a free marketing and business plan class.  \n\nOnce you have the \"homework\" completed, you will be able to call properties and land owners with the name of your company and the ability to answer their questions and concerns.  Additionally, you will have a better chance of ensuring compliance with local, city, and state regulations. You don't want to end up on the news for bad reasons!",

The farmers market framing makes sense.\n\nWhere these usually struggle isn’t demand, it’s **risk and ops**.\n\nA few practical points from similar pop ups I’ve seen:  \n• Liability is the real blocker for property owners, not space. They worry about accidents, test drives, theft, and disputes. Having event insurance and very clear rules upfront changes the conversation fast.  \n• Churches and community colleges are usually more open than office parks. Colleges already have precedent because of job fairs and auto fairs.  \n• What helps get a yes is positioning it as a controlled, staffed event with fixed hours, security, and zero on site test drives.\n\nBiggest failure risk I see:  \nIf sellers expect fast sales like a dealer lot, they’ll churn. This works better as exposure + credibility, not instant liquidity.\n\nAs a buyer, I’d trust it more than Facebook. As a seller, I’d try it once if the fee is reasonable and the event feels professionally run.\n\nIf you nail insurance, security, and seller expectations, this is viable.",

So even if you could manufacture a good quality shirt the mark up to get a tie with it will feel like wasted money. \n\nShoes with shoe tree - the issue here is quality, people dont tend to buy shoe trees and when they do its because the shoe is of exceptional quality. I dont think the average person is doing this for their everyday shoe so the premium you'd charge will put people off buying the shoe. \n\nPants and socks already exist. So you would be competing against existing brands\n\nSuits/shirt/ties - much like the wearing a shirt and tie, suits are rarely worn in the workplace. Men are buying less suits and but better quality, how are you going to manufacture high quality suits and then compete with well established brands.\n\nPolo/watch - this just is not a combo. Also are you becoming a watch maker? Or buying cheap ones from China? No one wants a shit watch when they buy a polo. \n\nSorry if this sounds like a savage take down of your idea, not my intention. I think you need to think about what the consumer of those products actually want/need. There maybe something in mens clothing that you could make a business out of, but I dont think this is it",

      "text": "Hiya, business fam! \n\nSo basically my small business idea is to demystify the cosmetic/fashion industry by creating incredibly detailed and personalized routines based on their face, personal preferences, time they have, religious, and/or social preferences (i.e. if they're boycotting something for a cause, finding a product from a company that supports the cause). We can also look at someone's wardrobe and put together some fits for them, analyze their body shape and see what clothes would look best for them based on their body. We can also recommend hair styles and colors based on their face shape, as well as accessories. It would also be nearly 100% because I'm planning for us to just use free resources like Canva/Google Slides to show clients their results of analysis/routines. I had a friend design a pretty awesome logo for free, and another make my website (and I insisted I could pay them both but they refused) I think the only few things that are cons are  \n1) I don't have a terrible amount of experience. Besides for a few friends birthday gifts in the past few years, I have no experience with this sort of thing. I just learn a lot and watch a lot of related content online.   \n2) Because I don't have much experience, I think it will take a lot of time to go through each client, but I assume that would get better with time/more experience. But that could cause problems when I first start up cause it could lead to cloggage (not sure if there's a better word for it, still really new to business)   \n3) I'm also worried we're offering too many services??? And that might make things confusing when we market or when we attract new customers   \nbut on the plus, side, I'm planning to have everything be super cheap! (because it's nearly 100% profit) Items won't be more than $20. That's also because I'm planning to market to   \n(also I saw \"we\" because I assume I will have employees in the future...right now it's just me haha)   \nThanks so much for your help in advance!   \n(P.S. some other things are:   \n\\+ I'm planning to market to the ambitious, intelligent, young women (or men!) who would love to present themselves better physically but may not have the time to research and explore and figure out what works best for them. (So these will most likely be highschoolers and/or college students who are broke, which is why my prices are so low)   \n\\+ how/which online payment should I use/set up? Would love to hear what other people are using/what works well for them. I'm trying to do my own research but terminology and what not is a bit confusing. ",

So why don't you do a test run with 5 to 10 clients for free, just to get a sense of 1) how long it takes to style 2) how long it takes to put together recommendations 3) gather their feedback about what they did and didn't like about the services (which could be used as testimonies/reviews later as you officially advertise the business).\n\nYou could also learn:\n\n* if there were elements of your service that maybe weren't needed or were needed that you didn't offer and you could add on.\n* how much time it takes so you can update your pricing structure and make sure you are paying yourself appropriately\n* if broke college students are the best clientele or if you should pivot to young professionals just entering the workforce, or people with unique body types and more disposable income or...\n\nEither way, the client you think you want might not be the client that's most likely to seek you out or most likely to be able to pay you sustainably.\n\nAnyway, good luck!",

      "text": "So I've been looking at this carpet cleaning business in Tucson and honestly it's kind of a fascinating deal.\n\nAt first glance it looks pretty boring - $1.9M revenue, $323k SDE, asking $449k (about 1.4x SDE). That's low enough that I almost passed on it thinking it was just another mediocre janitorial play.\n\nBut then I actually read through the P&L and CIM...\n\nThis thing isn't really a carpet cleaning business. Or I mean, it is - but that's almost just the lead gen side of it. They're running two businesses under one entity:\n\nThe carpet/tile cleaning is low margin repeat work, sure. But they're also doing water/fire/mold restoration - which is completely different economics. Way higher margins, insurance funded, bigger tickets.\n\nHere's the kicker though: they have a KB-2 general contractor license. Most restoration companies can only do mitigation (drying stuff out, tearing out damaged materials). These guys can do the full reconstruction. So they're capturing the entire insurance claim, not just the emergency response piece.\n\nThat changes everything about how this should be valued.\n\n**Why I think it's mispriced:**\n\n* Listed under \"specialty cleaning\" category instead of construction/restoration\n* The broker listing doesn't even mention the license moat\n* Some ownership complexity that's probably creating seller urgency\n\nNormal janitorial/cleaning businesses trade at 1.5-2x. Restoration with that kind of license? More like 3x+ depending on the market.\n\n**The stuff I'd need to figure out:**\n\nKey person risk is the big one - whoever holds the qualifying party status on that KB-2 matters a lot. Also need to dig into equipment condition (restoration businesses can hide deferred capex in old equipment) and make sure the DSCR math works for SBA financing (though even conservatively it looks solid).\n\nAnyway, I think there's a broader point here for anyone else searching - a lot of these \"boring\" SMBs are actually mispriced because of category errors or licensing nuances, not because the business fundamentals suck. Those tend to be the most interesting opportunities.\n\nI've been writing up one deal analysis like this each week if anyone finds this useful. Happy to answer questions about the mechanics here.",

      "text": "My New Year's Resolution, reducing reliance on paid leads. Over the last 5 years, I've started and worked with local service businesses where the main lead source was Angi or Thumbtack. It's the same story every time. You have a 4.8 star average review on Google, you pay to quote a lead, it's a fair price, but they end up going with Chuck in a Truck because he was $100 cheaper.\n\nI started to go where the money is. I put together a list of potential customers and networked. Over time, I became the guy that they thought of when their existing contractor showed up late. Or when he missed a spot for the fifth time. The list will vary based on the service that you offer but for the businesses I've operated and helped, these have been the honeypots.\n\nProperty Managers/Apartment Complexes - I put together a Google Map of all the apartments in my service area. I had 2 days/week where I would just drive to different ones and bring donuts, cookies, etc. I'd just give an intro but not even make an ask for a bid. I'm new in the business and want to introduce myself. Enjoy the treats! The goal is always to be likable.\n\nLocal Landlords - I'll look for rentals in my service area on Zillow, Redfin, Craigslist, etc and reach out to the landlords that are posting them. Again, this is about building a relationship and not necessarily making a pitch. If I can get them on the phone, then there's a good chance I will be able to pitch them when the time is right on that call.\n\nNew Homeowners - I target new homeowners who could potentially need my service. This one takes quite a bit of work and research and depends on the service offered. The same person I'd want to target if I'm a painter isn't the same person I'd want to target if I'm a landscaper. Then it's door hangers or mailers with a congrats on the new home message. Be a good neighbor.\n\nThe biggest mistake I see people make with their outbound is being overly aggressive. Odds are you aren't going to close them on the first interaction. If your goal is to try to get them to fire their guy on the spot, you lost. They don't trust you yet.\n\nI always try to be the safety net. That initial touchpoint is really simple. It's about introducing who I am, that I'm local, new in business (if true), and then a compliment about their property, office, complex, etc. Truly just be a human. Like you're meeting someone at a party for the first time. The treats are what lighten the mood.\n\nAnyone who works with contractors on a regular basis has been burned before by the Chuck in a Truck who didn't show up. Or who won't return their calls after they forgot to do part of the job. By being friendly and introducing yourself, you're putting yourself in first position to be their backup. It's a positive interaction that will keep you top of mind.\n\nEven if you're the most likable person they've met, assume that they're going to check your work. They're probably heading to Google after you leave to check your reviews and website. If you're new and you told them that, they may not put as much weight on this. It's why you should tell them if you are new. People like to give people chances. It's in our nature. Whatever you do, don't look like a hobbyist.\n\nThe interaction plants the seed but don't forget the follow up. You have to nurture that relationship. In the example of the property managers, I'll swing by when I have another job in their neighborhood to say hi and see how they're doing. I still do this even if I've gotten them to switch over to me. It just continues to reinforce the relationship. People want to do business with people they like. And firing you is really really hard if they like you.",

Paid upgrades, templates, add-ons, team licenses. One-time doesn’t mean one-and-done revenue. It just means the core unlock isn’t rented Also, collaboration comes later. First prove strangers will pay without you explaining it in a DM.",

          "text": "Ill be straight up with you bro. \n\nMaybe you were thinking as a developer first and not a business-first perspective on this one.\n\n1. The reason many businesses are shifting into subscription based model is to minimize piracy of their software. When it is more affordable for the user to pay a little amount monthly than to pay a big sum upfront, they would rather subscribe than buy it. Remember before spotify, music piracy was at its peak. Before netflix, torrent was at its most busiest. You get the idea.\n\n2. As a business, you need cashflow to help grow your company. If they only pay you once, surviving long term will be a challenge. Unless you have a big funding and some capital to burn while youre trying to convert clients.\n\n3. You need constant cashflow to continue development of future updates and improve the app over-time.",

I’m looking for something warm, aesthetic, and memorable (not too long).

          "text": "Finding a business name can be hard for sure. I think a good starting point is using a business name generator. You’re going to get some very generic ones but you will find some that you resonate with and can refine from there. I’ve got experience in rebranding companies and two things I’ve learned when selecting a name is:\n\n1. Make sure the domain name isn’t taken. It sucks to get very attached to a name and then realize afterwards it is taken.\n2. See how the name will look in your branding. Even using a free logo maker like logo.com or design.com can help you visualize it all together so rather than only relying on the business name giving off something warm, aesthetic and memorable, you want the whole brand including the colors, fonts and icon to do the same. This lets you also consider more abstract business names and still keep the overall feel of the branding warm.\n\nAnother mistake when starting is you don’t have to spend a lot for branding or design at the start. Focus on your product instead and you can always improve the branding as you go. At the start, set up a stall at local markets and talk to potential customers. It’s a great way to get feedback and research on what type of candles people in your community would buy. All the best with it!",

      "text": "Over many years I’ve come up with many business ideas but always tried my hardest to poke holes into why it wouldn’t work. I was always able to eventually defeat all of my ideas, except this one.\n\nThe reason I’m giving it away is because I don’t have the appetite to pursue it. I have a high paying job and a wife and kid. If this idea is successful, it would require me to work on it full time, and I’m not confident the profits would make it worth the risk of leaving a high paying salary and health insurance for my family. So if anyone wants to take it and run, have at it!\n\nThere are pillows for back sleepers, and even pillows for side sleepers (Pillow Cube), but where are the pillows for the tossers and turners? (My theory is most people actually flip between the two positions throughout the night.) The Hourglass Pillow is thinner in the center and thicker on the ends. While on your back, your head is cradled between the thicker sections, resting on the “normal pillow thickness” center section. When you roll to either side of your body, your head now rests on the thicker sections and the pillow takes up the gap between your head and mattress.\n\nIt’s called Hourglass Pillow based on the shape it makes if you were to stand it on its side. The thick sides slope inward to the thinner center. (Sorry if its hard to visualize) Makes for a catchy name for marketing.\n\nI haven’t seen a pillow specifically marketed for back AND side sleepers before which is why I think this might have legs. Unfortunately, though I’ve had this idea for over a year, recently I noticed Pillow Cube is releasing a new pillow for exactly this market. But their product is inferior. They take a normal foam pillow and cut a big hole out of it to put your head in. But this makes the pillow non-reversible. There is no gradual slope up to the thicker sides, it is a hard drop-off shelf. And the name isn’t as marketable as “Hourglass Pillow” is. Thoughts?",

The value proposition is the pillow being low enough to support back sleeping while at the same time high enough to support side sleeping when turned.\n\nThe pillows on google are often adjustable by taking out or putting in padding. Or they simply “say” is it for back and side sleeping, just to say it. In my research I only found 1 single pillow that has my value proposition but it is muddied amongst 12 other claims for how great it is, it is oddly shaped with extrusions, and has a terrible name.\n\nHalf of this idea is the idea itself to market a pillow specifically for back and side sleepers. Kind of like how Pillow Cube was one of the first to market specifically to side sleepers and they blew up. Then layer in the marketability of the name I created as well as the form factor. That’s what differentiates it from things like the mouthful that is “CozyRest® Memory Foam Neck Pillow”.",

Pillows are weirdly emotional purchases, and brand trust matters more than most people expect.\n\nIf someone were to test this, I would not start with manufacturing. I would validate demand with ugly prototypes or even a preorder page showing the concept and asking back and side sleepers what they hate about current options. If the conversion is not strong, the shape does not matter. Also worth noting is that once a category shows traction, bigger players copy fast, so differentiation has to be more than geometry.

The audience is monetized through a Shopify store using print-on-demand apparel and dropshipped accessories.

          "text": "I’ve seen a few of these play out (friends + people I’ve talked to who’ve sold audience-driven brands), and the big thing is this: valuation depends way more on who the buyer is than what you’ve built\n\nTo some buyers yeah this is “just social accounts” and merch. Those people will anchor on follower count and throw lowball offers like $20–40k. To the right buyer though (media company, brand aggregator, someone already selling to anime fans) this is a distribution engine with proven monetization. Totally different lens\n\nA few thoughts that might help you decide:\n- Mid-$30k isn’t crazy, but it’s also not a “you must take this now” number given your audience size + organic sales. I’ve seen smaller audiences sell for more when the buyer actually understands the niche\n\n- Burnout matters a lot honestly. One founder I spoke to only exited once the offer was high enough that it bought back mental space, not just money. If the offer doesn’t materially change your life or free you up, it often doesn’t feel “good enough” later\n\n- If you can package this as more than accounts (email list, repeat buyers, content cadence, supplier relationships, simple SOPs), you increase the odds of attracting a buyer who values it properly\n\n- Another option I’ve seen work is don’t fully exit. Sell majority, keep a small earnout or advisory role. That way you de-risk burnout but don’t undersell the upside\n\nThe question I’d ask yourself isn’t “is $30k fair?” but “if I take this will I be relieved… or annoyed six months later?” That answer usually tells you what to do\n\nIf you’re not desperate for the cash, waiting for a buyer who actually gets the space is usually worth it",

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a former car salesperson.  I worked at a Ford store for two years selling new and used cars.  While I learned a lot about sales during that time, to the behest of management, I always found myself acting as a customer advocate.  Contrary to management's beliefs, this actually worked out quite well for me (and them, unacknowledged).  While I certainly did well in negotiating the front-end of deals (dealer profit), the reason that people would send their friends and family to me was because I coached them on the \"back end\" like I would my own family.  For those unfamiliar, the \"back end\" consists of things like dealer add-ons, GAP, and holding points.  This is where people get their faces ripped off.  Sale price of the vehicle be damned; if you don't understand what all goes on in the back end, you may end up paying $48,000 for a $24,000 car.  Eventually, things got to a point where management wanted me to be their \"next superstar\", and indeed started trying to get me to rip peoples' faces off on the back end.  So, I quit for a much better industry.  Maybe I wasn't cut out for car sales, but maybe I just wanted to sell people cars without the bogus that comes along with the process for many people.\n\nSo, my idea.  And again, I know this isn't a new idea, so bear with me: car buying consulting.  I have seen a few YouTubers/social media personalities with this business, and I have also stumbled upon a few websites in my very preliminary research into this idea.  What I have found thus far is that the YouTube/social media personalities come off as extremely abrasive while the more website-based folks tend to have pretty \"corny\" websites that make me feel like I'm about to talk to another crusty used car salesman.\n\nI would set myself apart by building a clean, professional website offering tiers of service and through a much more professional demeanor and image than others I have seen in the space.  Revenue would be generated via a flat fee for base-tier services or a percentage of savings for more involved representation.  Despite the difficulty in setting oneself apart in an existing space, I don't believe that this market is saturated.\n\nIn order to start small, initial marketing and advertising would start through word of mouth; my pre-existing book of business of former customers.  The startup cost would be next to nothing, and based on my belief in working full-time until a business can replace full-time income, I think that it would be very manageable and low-risk.\n\nNow, the dilemma: is this business idea predatory in and of itself?  Recently, I helped a random redditor who got shafted by a dealership save thousands of dollars after the fact just by offering my advice.  And honestly, it felt so good, especially considering that the subreddit they posted in was just giving advice that only serves dealerships.  On one hand, I feel that my knowledge and experience *is* worth something, and considering that car-buying is dreaded by most consumers, I feel that I have a lot to offer.  On the other hand, I don't want to do something with my time that adds to the pain of car-buying.\n\nSo, what do you all think? If you were going to buy a car and I were able to save you thousands, would you be willing to pay me a percentage of savings, or would you rather take your chances on your own and try to negotiate yourself?  I know it's Reddit and it'll happen anyway, but honest answers only.  You won't hurt my feelings, I get rejected for a living, haha.  Thanks to those who have read this far.",

              "text": "Great question. \n\nFirst of all, I would offer a free consultation. A free consultation would essentially serve as an inbound lead generator for myself while serving as an information center for prospects.  The goal wouldn't be to give anything up for free, but rather to align myself with the prospect's goals and make sure that I'm a good fit for their needs.  I believe that doing so would build trust while also qualifying prospects. \n\nAs far as tiers go, here's what I had in mind.  I'm sort of thinking out loud, but here goes:\n\nTier 1 (self guided, consultation): \n\nThis would essentially be a one-time consultation. I would provide information like personalized car recommendations (when necessary), step-by-step guidance on fair pricing and negotiation, information on back-end items (warranty, GAP, financing, add-ons), and advice on trade-ins.  Customer would do most of the work, I'd give them the roadmap. The goal would be to arm the customer with as much information as possible for their specific needs, with an emphasis of how to handle the finance office.  Ideal customer would be first-time buyers and buyers with credit issues since these are the customers who tend to be taken advantage of the most.  I would also set myself apart by following up with a detailed document outlining the game plan; the to dos and not to dos.  I would charge a flat fee for this. \n\nTier 2 (done with you)\n\nEverything in tier 1 plus price research and suggested offers for multiple dealerships, review of contracts before signing, email/phone support during dealership visits, partial negotiation assistance when able (licensing may be an issue).  I would likely charge a percentage of savings assuming that the percentage would be higher than the flat fee; would need to iron this out. \n\nTier 3 (done for you)\n\nEverything in tier 2 plus complete market research, inventory scouting, dealership outreach, scheduling, negotiation, financing/trade-in handled entirely, optional extras like aftermarket recommendations or extended warranty advice. This would be a percentage of savings. \n\nI think the key for me would be offering a free consultation.  People buy from people that they know, like and trust.  I wouldn't want to operate a consulting business any other way, so I think that this would be essential.",

If I need it for an hour not that big of deal, but if I want it for 2+ hours (sometimes there are long layovers, but not hotel justified) then the price gets overwhelming. There comes a point where I can just book a night at a hotel nearby for much cheaper even if I’ll only use it for 4 hours. I think it would be best to have a sliding scale price. $35 for 1 hour, $75 for 4 hours type thing (just throwing numbers) \n\nThat would make it more attractive. I’ve booked a hotel room before for the 5 hours I’ll be in JFK for $99 bucks on booking, which is came out to be cheaper than the napping pod. And I got a shower, and a good nap.",

So it’s kind of two businesses in one: a single-screen microcinema + a physical media hub.\n\nThe vibe I’m aiming for is “local film community clubhouse”. The kind of place you go to browse for an hour, discover something weird or interesting, and then come back for a screening on the weekend. I'm very inspired by places like Frida Cinema in LA and Row House Cinema in Pittsburgh. \n\nI also really loved Family Video and Blockbuster growing up, and I was still frequenting my local Family Video until it closed 5 years ago. I feel like physical media has been on the rise again recently, and obviously people still love going to record stores that play into that same niche of wanting older, physical media. But there's not a whole lot of places that do this specifically for movies, besides like Vintage Stock. \n\nMaybe I'm strange, but I still long for the movie rental places and I want to bring that sort of third place to my community.\n\nQuestions I’d love input on:\n* If you’ve seen a model like this succeed/fail, what were the key reasons?\n* What would you want included (memberships, concessions, trade-ins, pricing, programming)?\n* What are the biggest risks or hidden costs I’m probably underestimating?\n\nBe brutally honest. I’d rather get reality-checked now while I'm just daydreaming about this lol",

But in terms of competing with rentals, I think that there is ways of being viable by having very good deals for those who have a membership at the store, like they could get rent multiple movies a week for a fraction of what it would cost to rent them individually from youtube or apple. \n\nFor attracting customers, the theater itself would be the biggest driver. Having popular older movies playing I feel would be a great advertisement for the store, and while I don't think it would be great for making money, I think it would be great for just getting people into the store. And then having it being more community focused with memberships, a movie club, movie discussions afterward, etc could get those people to stay as well.\n\nAnd then the two business models would be tricky, but I don't think this works with either of the ideas independently, I only see it working if they are in junction.",

      "text": "Ok so I've been looking at SMB acquisitions for a while and stumbled into something that feels almost too good to be true, but the math actually works.\n\nBasically, you find a business with real estate included (or owned separately by the seller). Pretty common in manufacturing, auto repair, flex industrial, etc.\n\nInstead of buying the real estate WITH the business, you negotiate a sale-leaseback as part of the deal structure.\n\nHere's what happens:\n\n1. Find a real estate investor or sale leaseback firm (they exist) to buy the commercial property that comes with the deal, on the condition that they lease it back to you triple net for 20 years after.\n2. You effectively bid down the purchase price of the business by the value of the property, and cash flow is only impacted marginally.\n3. Good deal for you, the real estate investor, and the seller.\n\nLet me give you a rough example:\n\nTraditional deal:\n\n* Business + RE purchase price: $1.5M\n* SBA requires 10% down: $150k out of pocket\n\nSale-leaseback structure:\n\n* Business only price: $900k\n* RE stays with seller, you lease at $6k/month\n* SBA loan: $810k (90%)\n* Seller note: $90k (10%)\n* Your equity: $0\n\nThe lease payment ($72k/year) replaces what would've been mortgage interest + property tax + maintenance anyway. And the seller gets passive rental income forever, which a lot of retiring boomers actually prefer.\n\nThe part that blows my mind is that if the cashflow supports the lease, you're basically arbitraging the equity requirement between asset classes. SBA won't finance real estate at the same leverage, but they'll finance the business - and the landlord (seller) is financing the real estate through the lease.\n\nAm I missing something here? I know there's risk if the business fails you lose the lease, but that's true of any deal. And I know some sellers won't go for it. But for the ones who do... this seems like a legit no-money-down structure.\n\nAnyone done this? Poke holes in it for me because it feels like a cheat code.",

Since layoffs are rampant and there have been over 1M+ layoffs in 2025 alone, I’m sure layoffs will unfortunately continue in the new year.\n\nThis is where my idea comes in. I work in People Operations and hiring and have overcome 2 layoffs myself since 2020. I’m thinking about starting a side consulting business targeting companies who have recently gone through layoffs to help coach their managers on how to help maintain employee motivation and productivity after surviving layoffs. In addition to this, I would also pitch a package to help out their employees who recently got laid off to help with clarity, next steps, helping them land on their feet, etc. I’d like to try to pitch this as B2B so as not to go after vulnerable laid off employees..they’ve already suffered enough and I feel as though there’s too many “job search gurus” out there.\n\nAny feedback on this idea? I currently work full time and would like to figure out how to balance this/make sure my employer would be fine with me creating something like this on the side if they were to find out. I also would like to continue to build my LinkedIn presence, which my company will most likely see.\n\nTYIA and happy 2026!",

She has deep expertise not only in editing, but also in storytelling, direction, pacing, and high-end commercial standards.\n\nThe problem is that she never really made the jump to build something of her own. She’s incredible at what she does, but has always worked inside agencies and studios. I want to help her turn that experience into a side business, which could eventually become her main business.\n\nThe idea is to:\n\n\t•\tOperate remotely from Argentina (lower cost base)\n\n\t•\tOffer high-quality editing and post-production services to US-based clients\n\n\t•\tPosition it as senior-level, agency-grade work, not cheap low-quality outsourcing\n\nI’d love your thoughts on a few things:\n\n\t1.\tHow would you start validating this?\n\nCold outreach? Platforms? Networking? Content? Partnerships?\n\n\t2.\tPricing:\n\nWhat do experienced editors / studios usually charge in the US?\n\n\t•\tHourly vs project-based?\n\n\t•\tMonthly retainers for creators or brands?\n\n\t3.\tRemote structure:\n\nHow would you structure workflows, contracts, payments, revisions, time zones, etc. when working cross-border?\n\n\t4.\tPositioning:\n\nWould you sell this as a personal brand (editor-led) or as a small studio?\n\n\t5.\tAnything you’d avoid or do differently if you were starting today?\n\nIf anyone here is a content creator, brand owner, or agency and might need help with editing, we’re also happy to connect or even do test projects.\n\nI’m really trying to do this right and help her finally build something that’s hers, so any honest feedback is more than welcome.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

          "text": "This is a strong idea, and your sister’s background is a real differentiator. Senior, agency-level editing is a completely different market than generic remote editors, especially in the US.\n\nFor validation, I’d avoid broad freelancer platforms early - they usually push prices down and hide experience. Targeted outreach to agencies, production teams, and brands already running ads tends to work better, positioning her as an extension of their team, not outsourcing. A tight, curated portfolio that shows storytelling decisions often converts better than a big reel.\n\nPricing-wise, most experienced editors move away from hourly and toward project work or retainers. Buyers pay for reliability and standards, not location. Positioning it as a small studio led by a senior editor often feels safer to clients than a solo freelancer.\n\nWho do you want as your first core client: agencies, brands, or ad-driven creators?",
