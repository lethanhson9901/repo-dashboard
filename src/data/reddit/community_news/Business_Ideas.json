      "text": "I've been building a pipeline that scrapes court filings, DOT enforcement actions, and industry cost benchmarks to find operational failures - basically where businesses lose money due to broken processes.\n\nJust finished a deep dive into **Trucking & Freight** and wanted to share what stood out.\n\n**The method:** I pull data from FMCSA compliance records, ATRI cost benchmarking studies, and commercial insurance loss data. Then cross-reference with bankruptcy filings to estimate actual dollar impact.\n\n**Operating Costs Hit $2.26/Mile While Rates Crater**\n\nNon-fuel operating costs alone reached $1.779 per mile in 2024 - the highest in 17 years of tracking. Meanwhile, the freight recession drove rates below breakeven in most markets. We're talking $35,600 to $226,000 per truck annually just bleeding out because fuel, insurance, maintenance, and driver wages are climbing faster than carriers can raise prices. The math just doesn't work anymore.\n\nBased on documented cases from ATRI industry benchmarking affecting every carrier regardless of size.\n\n**Foreign Fleets Running Tampered ELDs and Underpaying Drivers 40%**\n\nThis one's wild. Foreign-owned operations are running drivers with tampered electronic logging devices to exceed federal hours-of-service limits. They're paying 40% below market rates and undercutting legitimate operators on price while violating DOT safety regs. Law enforcement doesn't have the resources to police it effectively, so legal carriers just... lose contracts to people breaking the law. Estimated $100K-$300K in lost revenue for typical small operations.\n\nDocumented through DOT enforcement actions, though actual prevalence is likely way higher than reported.\n\n**Insurance Premiums Up 36% While Nuclear Verdicts Multiply**\n\nCommercial trucking insurance exploded 36% over eight years. The litigation environment got hostile - $10M+ jury awards are becoming common in truck accident cases. Insurers don't care about your individual safety record anymore, they're just jacking rates across the board. For a 10-truck operation, you're looking at $45K-$180K annually just for coverage. Fatal crashes are up 40% since 2014 because regulatory changes let less-qualified people get CDLs, which feeds right back into the insurance nightmare.\n\nIndustry-wide challenge documented across all major commercial trucking insurers.\n\n**The Working Capital Black Hole**\n\nShippers pay net-30 to net-60+ while you're covering fuel, wages, and maintenance daily. You're essentially financing your customers' operations for 30-90 days. Most new carriers don't realize they need $50K-$200K in working capital just to bridge the gap between expense and revenue. This cash flow mismatch is a contributing factor in the majority of small carrier bankruptcies.\n\nDocumented in payment delay cases and factoring industry analysis.\n\n**What I'm seeing:** There's no carrier-focused rate optimization platform despite persistent rate compression. No driver competency assessment tools despite the 40% crash increase. The infrastructure just doesn't exist to help legitimate operators compete.\n\nI have 15 more documented gaps in this industry with solution blueprints (pricing models, where to find first clients, estimated launch costs).\n\nDoes anyone here actually work in this niche? Is it really this bad on the inside?\n\nI have a document with the full raw data list. If you want to dig in, let me know and I'll DM it.\n\nIf you're in a different industry and want me to run the same analysis, tell me which one.\n\n",

But you would need experience and backend work to make that doable.\n\nFraud is the least of truckers worries right now, margins are getting tighter then ever and carrier companies are going out of business left and right.\n\n  \nHustle: Right now, if I were to start a company to help out carriers/companies, it would be selling pre-trip inspections for the company and filling up there trucks. Specifically to larger fleets of 20+ that are contracted locally. Finding ways to save them money...essentially and continue operations without a hiccup.\n\nReason: The people that drive trucks.....are slow.(not all, but its embarrassing) They fill up trucks with gas all the time or put diesel in the def, crash into bridges.... They will straight up drive off the lot without seeing they have 2 blown out tires and the brakes are smoking..... This costs the company so much time and money....drivers will do anything to avoid inspections and working. If you could secure a deal per truck that you do a inspection on each one, you would save them so much time....and nip the issues in the butt before having to call a tow truck on the other side of the city to bring to a shop to fix..\n\n  \nanyways good luck",

I’ve had to keep raising my fee just to avoid taking on more work than I can handle.\n\nThis also works with businesses. Not because owners are dopamine-addicted like creators, but because they’re just old. For example, I work with a crane rental company that rents industrial cranes for high-rise construction. I help them find contracts for 15 cranes per year totaling roughly $6M in profit for them. My 5% commission on that is not bad.\n\nI guess ask me anything, just wanted to give hope to introverts still starting out. You don’t need to be public and exposed online to make money.\n",

Even a basic playbook like “lead capture → nurture → offer → follow-up” you run for every creator or business lets you scale, hire help, and eventually step out of ops.\n\nI’d also split by niche: one track for creators (funnels, fan monetization, sponsorship systems) and one for old-school businesses (lead gen, quoting, follow-up automations). Tools like HighLevel or HubSpot for the plumbing, Ahrefs or Similarweb for research, and Pulse alongside those to watch Reddit for raw buyer questions and language you can plug straight into your funnels.\n\nMain point: if you can systemize backend value instead of chasing attention, you can quietly build something big and defensible.",

      "text": "So Brandon and Carter got laid off during COVID. Instead of doom-scrolling, they noticed something: service trucks were everywhere, but people hated dealing with them. No-shows, surprise charges, dirty boots through clean houses.\n\nThey spent $153 at Home Depot and started cleaning windows in Austin. Fast forward to 2025: Pink's Window Services is a multi-million dollar franchise network with 236+ units across 29 states.\n\nBut here's what actually matters, they didn't win on the service. They won on the *strategy*.\n\n**The marketing playbook:**\n\n**1. Pick a story first, service second**  \nThey didn't start with \"we clean windows.\" They started with \"bring dignity back to blue-collar work.\" That one sentence became their north star for everything: name, branding, how they hire, how they show up.\n\n**2. Make boring things visually unforgettable**  \nNavy trucks. Crisp uniforms. Pink accents everywhere. It looks like a 1950s gas station mixed with a streetwear brand.\n\n[pink windows services](https://preview.redd.it/s0mvyzg9s9hg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=05fae98584a485b9207dda61e05bdff940f7a02f)\n\nOther home service companies could do this tomorrow. Most just... don't.\n\n**3. Turn operations into marketing**  \nOn-time arrivals when they say they'll arrive. Online booking instead of phone tag. Handwritten thank-you notes. Free pressure washing on driveways for recurring customers.\n\nWhen your actual service experience is better than 90% of competitors, people talk about it. Their reviews mention the *people* and the *experience* more than the actual clean windows.\n\n**4. Content isn't an afterthought, it's the strategy**  \nThey post VHS-style videos, clips of techs doing kickflips in uniform, \"comp clean of the week\" features of local businesses.\n\nIt reads like a lifestyle brand, not \"commercial window cleaning LLC trying to sell you something.\"\n\n**5. Merch becomes word-of-mouth**  \nThey give genuinely cool gear to staff and top customers. People started buying Pink's hats, jackets, socks, not because they needed them, but because they look good.\n\nThat's free marketing walking around.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\nYou don't need a new app or a new category/industry. You can take something as unglamorous as window cleaning and, through clear positioning, strong branding, thoughtful operations, and consistent content, build something franchisees actually want to be part of.\n\nThe playbook works for HVAC, plumbing, landscaping, handyman services, pest control—literally anything blue-collar right now.\n\nThe question isn't whether your industry is boring. It's whether you're willing to make it interesting.\n\n*Edit: Lots of people asking how they got franchisees to buy in early. Short answer: proof in the numbers. Their Austin location did $750K-$985K with 30%+ margins. Hard to say no to that. You can find their exact marketing strategy* [here](https://marketingcrafted.com/case-studies/pink-windows)",

Only issue I can think of is that I am not sure how fast I could get someone there money as I would probably need to have the item in hand before money can be transfered to prevent getting scammed.\n\nAgain this is just a random idea I just thought up while trying to fall asleep so its probably crap but I figured why not post about it here and see what people say about it.

I'm their business manager here in the States, and I don't have prior experience with non-US citizen registering an LLC.   \n  \nMy client is currently living in Europe and looking to set up an LLC for a consulting business. I've been  doing a deep dive into the best states for non-US citizens and honestly, the more I read, the more I get confused.\n\nThe business customers/clients are mostly in the US and UK, and we don't plan on having a physical office or employees in the States. So we're mainly looking for low annual maintenance fees and ease of opening a bank account (Mercury/Relay) as a non-resident.\n\nAnother non-US person I know actually tried to DIY their LLC formation last year in Florida because they liked the vibe of the state. Long story short, she ended up with a massive headache regarding the Registered Agent requirement and some unexpected state filings that she didn't realize were mandatory. She almost got her non-US citizen LLC entity dissolved because she missed a notice that was sent to a physical address she didn't have access to. I don't know why she used that address in the first place.\n\nWyoming seems to be the \"budget-friendly\" darling with great privacy. New Mexico keeps popping up for being super cheap, but I don't hear much about it from actual founders.\n\nDo we have to worry about running into any weird tax issues (Form 5472/1120) that can get harder because of the state we choose?\n\nThank you for reading this long-ass post.",

More than New Mexico ($50-125/year). Main difference is CNMI requires a business license, Wyoming and New Mexico don't.\n\nWhy this might work:\n\nYour registered agent handles all the admin - filing, deadlines, reminders. That nightmare your friend had with missed notices and almost getting dissolved? That's what you're paying someone to prevent.\n\nYour client doesn't need to be in CNMI. We work with Europe-based clients regularly. U.S. banks operate here, so account setup shouldn't hit roadblocks.\n\nTrade-off:\n\nNot the cheapest - New Mexico wins that. But if you want someone actively keeping everything compliant and making sure nothing slips through the cracks, the extra \\~$100-175/year might be worth it.\n\nQuick note: Form 5472/1120 are federal, so those apply whether you form in Wyoming, New Mexico, or CNMI.",

I also received some replies from people I messaged, which suggests that there is demand.\n\nWhat I cannot do for now is any form of paid advertising due to financial reasons.\n\nWhat I am thinking of trying next is creating my own subreddit where I can share my service.\n\nI have also considered creating content on social media, but I do not want something that would take eight months or a year before I start getting clients. I want an approach that can start producing some results within one or two months, even if small, so I can begin getting in contact with people more quickly. This is one of the main reasons why I initially chose Reddit, because it allows for direct and immediate interaction. I can message people, they can message me, comment, and engage in real time, which makes the process much more dynamic and direct.\n\nWho am I, you might ask. I am a Senior Director and SEO with over five years of experience in the tech industry. I have worked on different projects including apps, websites, machine learning, database management, and AI, delivering technical solutions and products, market studies, and strategies. I have mainly worked with local factories, stores, and large warehouses. I stopped working for a year to study AI algorithms and solutions. \nDuring this time, I discovered that I really enjoy helping others in their journey to become Product Managers, Directors, and leaders, and to achieve their personal and professional goals.

What works better: contribute genuinely useful answers in communities where your target audience already asks questions. LinkedIn is actually ideal for the PM/director audience, posting about real decisions you've made, frameworks you've used, lessons learned. The catch with your 1-2 month timeline is that trust-based services need trust first. The people who saw your posts before they got removed and reached out, that's the model working at small scale. The sustainable version: answer questions in PM-focused subreddits without pitching, have a clear profile bio that explains what you do, and let interested people find you.

Do you have any deadline or particular reasons for it ?\n\nI'd say, from your main 90-minute coaching offer, that your best shot could very well be on LinkedIn, as that is where you could find lots of Active Product Managers and Directors. You could use posts to give tips, exercises and frameworks that could be useful to them and get their attention, and, at the same time, use LinkedIn to connect and reach out directly to Product Managers and Directors, offering a lead magnet or a free audit (that will allow you to then upsell them to your main 90-minute offer). Aiming for 100 personalised reach outs a week would be great, at first just asking them about how their work is going, creating trust, and then when Quarter-Reviews are approaching, shoot your shot and tell them about your offer !\n\nNow, I read through the comment and saw that you were experienced in creating tech product, and not so much in marketing. So, I would add that if you haven't heard of it yet or haven't set it up for your business and offers, I'd highly encourage you to build what's called a Growth Engine (Scorecard + The Actual Engine). This helps you monitor your whole business and user experience, from start to finish, and will help you convert more and keep your clients and prospects in the loop for longer.\n\nIf you want Ryan Deiss has a great template and framework for that. I'm also always glad to be of help so if you need any more details on that or anything marketing just reach out and I'll be there !",

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI just hit a personal milestone last week: [I published my 12th book, *Unlimit*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0GH1D5YLB) 🥳🎉 \n\nIn the past week, the book hit #1 in four different Entrepreneurship categories, beating out a number of mainstream published \"heavyweights\" like Cal Newport, Seth Godin, James Altucher and many others. 💪 \n\nLooking at the dashboard, I've sold just under 100,000 copies across all my titles since I began this self-publishing journey back in 2014.\n\n**In this post, I'll share an outline covering every step of the process so that you can duplicate my success. If you follow the steps in this post, you're well on your way to earning $20,000 per book through self-publishing** (potentially more, if you take advantage of the post launch opportunities as well)!\n\n**The Case For Writing a Book**\n\nA published book is like an online business card. Your book carries your message, showcases your expertise, and builds a relationship with the reader in a way that few other mediums can. If someone spends a weekend reading your writing, they’ve spent a long time becoming acquainted with you through your words.\n\nAn ebook is a self-liquidating lead source, and an Amazon book is an excellent top-of-funnel item. When you look at a book as a potent form of marketing – and a relationship building tool for you – suddenly a world of possibilities open up. A free book is seen as a gift – it’s a welcome form of advertising – which people embrace with open arms. And it costs almost no money or time to give them away. An e-book can be reproduced indefinitely with no marginal cost.\n\nAlthough I have tons to say on this topic, I'll try not to make this “ultimate guide” too long and only tell you what you need to know 🤣\n\nIn the book, I share hundreds of ways to optimize your motivation, willpower, energy, and effectiveness. Here's a quick outline of hacks anyone can use:\n\n**How to Write a 100,000+ Word Book in Six Weeks**\n\n**1. Create Just the Right Amount of Pressure to Perform at Your Best (not too little, not too much)**\n\nThe 19th-century Russian novelist, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, had an unusual habit: he would deliberately gamble away his money whenever he became financially successful from the sales of his books. By creating extra pressure, he motivated himself to produce great work, far faster, to pay off his debts.\n\nFunny enough, Dostroyevsky wrote his book The Gambler in just 26 days to pay off one of his gambling debts. Without all of the trappings of wealth distracting him, his true purpose would again materialize. He was forced into a position where he needed to produce or starve. Just the right amount of pressure and the ticking clock forced him to focus and perform at the highest level.\n\nWhile performing research for my book, I learnt about the Yerkes-Dodson Law which asserts that just the right amount of pressure - not too little, not too much - leads us to perform at our best. This lends itself to a \"golden mean\" of mental arousal where we are able to find our \"genius zone.\n\n**2. Set Deliberate Time Constraints**\n\nYou can create this effect for yourself by setting time constraints and deadlines, and scheduling launches, live events, and so on where there is more pressure to succeed.\n\nWe tend to become much more focused and productive when we work in \"sprints\" - for example, if I have half an hour to write a post such as this one before several morning appointments, it compels me to make use of every minute and not waste any time.\n\n**3. Commit Publicly to Your Goal - No Half Measures**\n\nNext, I made a public commitment. A big reason why I was so motivated to complete my book is because I placed the book up for preorder on Publishizer, where I sold more than 300 pre-orders before I even began to write. Because I had already made a public commitment to the book and people had already paid for it, the extra pressure propelled me forward.\n\n**4. Use your phone to dictate everything** \n\nWhenever I try to sit down at a desk in my room or in an office, my mind starts to rebel and begin racing anywhere else besides the task at hand like a disobedient child.\n\nSo I wrote the entire book while working out at the gym, or hanging out at the park, or at the beach and just talking into my phone. This was the best way to put what was in my head into the document without any friction or internal resistance. \n\n**5. Maximize Your Energy**\n\nSunlight upon waking up and throughout the day, intermittent fasting, movement (even just 10 minutes of strenuous exercise like sprints, calisthenics, bodyweight, animal flow, etc) – all of these are daily routines that help a great deal.\n\n**6. Overcome the tyranny of the blank page** \n\nIf you already have existing content, you can save all of this in PDFs and import it into Google Notebook LM to help you build an outline and brainstorm ideas for your book. \n\nIf nothing else, this will remind you of some of your favorite concepts that you can build into chapters for your book. This is based on the “tickler files”  psycho-cybernetics hack created by Maxwell Maltz and is especially helpful if you just need a push to get started.\n\nYou can copy all of your LinkedIn posts, for example, or save transcripts from your videos on YouTube. I also upload my presentations from my in person workshops. One of my favorite tools is an extension called “IG post exporter,” it collects all of the meta information from any Instagram profile and exports it as a CSV, which you can convert into a PDF and import into Notebook.\n\n*Once you have your manuscript all or partially completed, you are ready to move on to the pre-launch phase.*\n\n**Four-Phase Book Marketing Strategy**\n\n**1) Pre-launch warmup and list building campaign.** We begin by connecting with users through value-added initiatives, such as free resources, lives, in-person meetups and workshops, and Google meets where we connect with individual users and help them with their problems. \n\nThese interactions with your readers are gold and uncover all kinds of insights, plus these people become your early advocates and beta readers. \n\nWith this group as your foundation, you can build up a pre-launch email list using highly valuable free offers and Facebook form advertising. \n\n**2) Launch a high-energy, high-interest prelaunch book crowdfunding campaign.** This allows us to validate the market, build a pre-order list, and upsell our respective coaching and products directly to the people who need them most.\n\nYou can create a proposal on Publishizer before the manuscript is even created, generate pre-orders from your tribe, promote the book online and at live events, and attract interest from agents and publishers. This completed, we can move onto step 3.\n\n**3) A successful Publishizer campaign gives us a launchpad to go deeper.** We can leverage our success further through a launch on Kickstarter, and advertise to even more users. We can enlist the services of crowdfunding specialists and marketing newsletters (resources are listed at the end of this post) and lists to drive maximum traffic to our book pre-launch, as well as Kickstarter’s own massive organic traffic. \n\n**4) After generating this massive groundswell of interest and pre-orders, we can officially “launch” the book.** If we receive an attractive offer from a mainstream publisher, we can accept their agreement and collect the advance royalty payments and royalties. If we choose to self-publish, we proceed with a launch on Amazon and take #1 best-seller in every category. \n\n**Here’s a breakdown of the Amazon Launch Timeline:**\n\n*Day 1: Publish the book.*\n\n*Days 2-6: Run a free promotion and get as many reviews as humanly possible. E-mail everyone you know. Ideally you gave out a bunch of copies to beta-readers a few weeks before publishing. Now’s the time to get in touch with them! Ask people to download the book from Amazon for free, then write a review. It will be listed as a “Verified Purchase” review.*\n\n*Days 7-9: get blasted out on 99 cent promo sites*\n\n*Days 10-16ish: remain at 99 cents and get as many downloads as possible*\n\n*Day 17ish: change to real price, ideally with #1 hot new release and #1 bestseller in your categories.*\n\nMake certain to schedule all of your promotions at the same time, to maximize your chances of shooting up the rankings and getting organic traffic from Amazon. \n\nWhen submitting your book, choose categories that are not overly competitive so that you can easily get the number one best seller position. Since you can choose three subcategories, you can try choosing one that's very niche (to rank at the top and get the bestseller badge) and two bigger ones where you get more visibility.\n\nYou can also consider setting up some advertisements for your book to help increase its visibility. I wrote a step-by-step guide about how to create Amazon ads, without breaking the bank, here.\n\nCross sell your other books (if any) and other products after the title page. You can link directly to your other books on Amazon, or offer a coupon code for a product on another platform like Gumroad. I did this very successfully for my book about freelancing on Upwork: I read a bunch of free promotions with a coupon code inside to download my freelancing business in a bundle at a much higher price point, selling several hundreds of these.\n\n**5) Use the book to generate more revenue and equity for your businesses.** This includes things like cross-sells, list building, public relations, paid speaking opportunities, and as a front-end lead source for higher-ticket products and offers. You can also tap into direct revenue streams from a successful book, such as selling the foreign rights of the book so that it gets translated into different languages. I have one friend who pocketed $8,000 just from selling the rights to translate his book into Korean. The contacts you make through Publishizer can help connect you to agents to sell the rights to translate your book, otherwise just type this into Google and start connecting with agents on LinkedIn:\n\n*site:linkedin.com/in/ \"foreign rights\" \"manager\"*\n\n*site:linkedin.com/in/ \"foreign rights\" \"agent\"*\n\n**Take care and all the best! Happy publishing 😊** I know there was a lot covered, so if you have any questions let me know and I’ll be happy to jump in with additional tips!\n\nDanny\n\n**PS Links to resources and tools linked in the comments 👇**",

Nobody in the village wears shoes, so we will have no customers.”\n\nThe second salesperson calls *his* boss: “This is a great idea. Nobody in the village wears shoes, so we will have lots of customers!”\n\nFor small businesses without a website, which salesperson is correct? You have the chance to find out!\n\n(I personally think the first salesperson is correct. If a business doesn’t have a website today, that probably means they don’t want one enough to ever pay for it. You are better off targeting businesses with bad / old websites and having them upgrade - then at least you are selling shoes to people who have bought shoes before.\n\nBut my view is filtered through richer Western cities where I work. The experience in Mumbai, where perhaps it’s harder to find good cheap website builders, may be different and the second salesperson may prove correct and wealthy.)\n\nGood luck!",

Check how long they've been on the platform and look for reviews from buyers in your region. Ask for references from other customers. Trade Assurance or similar payment protection is worth the fees for first orders.

I sold my business a few years ago and while I wait to launch my new offering, I figured I'd launch a web app to help others, which will include suppliers I've personally vetted as well on how to vet new ones yourself, along with other info. I'll be charging from $99 for this app. Would you pay for something like this?",

I’m thinking of setting up a punching machine outside a local pub as a small pay-per-use attraction, but I’m working on a tight budget and trying to choose the most viable entry point.\n\n\nRight now, I’m torn between two options: buying an older refurbished punching machine from a local seller, or going for a new aftermarket machine that’s often sold at discounted prices on platforms like Amazon, Alibaba, and eBay. On paper, the aftermarket machines look attractive because they’re cheaper, easier to find, and sometimes come with basic warranties. At the same time, I keep hearing that refurbished older machines are generally more durable and better built, even if they come with some wear.\n\n\nMy main concerns are reliability, long-term maintenance costs, and how well either option would hold up in an outdoor or semi-outdoor pub environment. I’m also thinking about customer perception. Does the machine feel solid and legit enough to attract people to try it and keep coming back?\n\n\nFor anyone who has started small, worked with arcade-style machines, or dealt with refurbished versus aftermarket equipment, which option seems more viable for a low-budget startup like this, and why?",

Basically paying for peace of mind and automating bday gift giving. \n\nI would create a form for people to fill out with names, birthdays, budget and gift (would likely start with flowers). I would then send out the bday gifts so it would be set it and forget it for the customer. Value is removing cognitive load and avoiding missed birthdays, not the flowers themselves.\n\nI would do an annual fee and then take a service fee on each delivery. There’s obviously ways to automate, get better bulk pricing, etc. down the line but right now I’m testing the idea and then working to get initial customers (probably waive the annual fee for their first few) and doing everything manually. \n\nThoughts?

      "text": "A pipe dream of mine is starting a beverage company, starting with lemonade. But the name would be “Lemonayy”. The “-ayy” replacing “-ade” because I believe “ayy” is culturally relevant thanks to the internet and pop culture. My friends and I growing up would always say “ayy” to celebrate a success or even just say what’s up to each other. My family would always say “ayy” when we walked in the front door on holidays. I guess it’s slang, but it makes me smile just saying it and perhaps consumers would feel the same. It strikes an emotional chord. \n\nI have the Lemonayy recipe nailed down that focuses on lower sugar and all organic ingredients so the goal is to remain a healthier RTD beverage targeting younger people more present on the internet (which is a lot). I’ve actually went out in public with my Lemonayy stand and had about 50 or so people try it and with good feedback overall on the taste.\n\nLiquid Death has done this with water, so it’s a “similar” approach. Clever marketing, nothing revolutionary other than the name itself.\n\nThe goal is to create a cult following of Lemonayy drinkers lol. I think most beverage companies operate with the same goal for their product.\n\n“Do you drink lemonade?” \n\n“Nah I drink Lemonayy.”\n\nAnd then other flavors could come into the mix like Blueberrayy, Watermelonayy, Raspberrayy, Strawberrayy, etc. Perhaps even an alcoholic product like Champayygne.\n\nThe names are almost so chaotic and goofy it would have to grab attention.\n\nI’m in the infancy stage of making this a real business and I’m obviously biased thinking this could work, but is anyone in here willing to chime in on their thoughts and opinions? I know CPG and consumables like this are saturated and a tough market so if anyone is currently in that industry I’d love your feedback too.",

Difficult to do, and it doesn’t sound like something you could compare to. \n\nHowever, comparing your brand to Olipop is perfect. Take after their story. It gives you the competitive edge that helps you stand out from the big names. \n\nAdding electrolytes is the key in my opinion. I can already picture an ad, a play on the traditional vibe of a hardworking man outside in the sun and a woman bringing him a glass of lemonade.
