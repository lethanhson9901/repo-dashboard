      "text": "I made $200 in the last 2 weeks from mine. Proof in comments if you don’t believe me.\n\nMy goal is $2k/month by end of year. And no, I’m not going hard on this, I’m putting in maybe 1-2 hours a week. So that’s why it’ll take 10 months instead of 2. Slow and steady but basically passive so I’m not complaining.\n\nAnyway here’s what I’m doing if you want to copy it:\n\nNiche first\n\nFinance pays the best CPMs but don’t just do “finance.” Go specific. Finance for single moms, stock market for complete beginners, that kind of thing. AI is also a solid bet right now, it’s genuinely exploding. Health, dating, local news — all work too. Just pick something and commit.\n\nBuild it like a company not a diary\n\nSeriously don’t attach your name to it. You want something you could sell one day. A newsletter with your name on it is a freelance gig. A newsletter brand is an actual asset. Different things.\n\nPlatform\n\nSubstack is free and fine for starting. I use beehiiv. Better customization and they have their own ad network built in, which means you can monetize from day 1 without finding a single sponsor yourself. That alone sold me on it.\n\nGetting subscribers\n\nThis is where most people get stuck. Options are:\n\nMeta ads — reliable but expensive. beehiiv has a paid boost feature too where other newsletters basically send their readers your way. Both cost money though.\n\nFree route is content. X, LinkedIn, Reddit. Reddit has been my main thing. I post about side hustles, people find value in it, they subscribe. Got around 150 new subs just last week from Reddit. This exact type of post is how I do it.\n\nSending issues\n\nJust send consistently. AI helps a lot with organizing and formatting but you still have to know how to use it properly or the output is terrible. I use it as a tool not a ghostwriter.\n\n(Writing this post myself by the way, hence the grammar crimes lol)\n\nMoney\n\nSmall newsletter? Use the beehiiv ad network. I’m at 2k subscribers and making $15-20 per issue from it. Not retiring off it but I’m sending the newsletter anyway so it’s basically found money.\n\nHit 5k and you can start going after real sponsors — $100 to $400 per placement depending on your niche. That’s when it gets genuinely interesting.\n\nYou can also do digital products or affiliate stuff on top of that. Multiple streams from the same audience.\n\nAutopilot\n\nOnce you’re at 5k, set up a beehiiv boost at like $1.50-$2 per subscriber. Keep some budget running and you get new subscribers without doing anything.\n\nFor the actual issues, either get a VA or build out an AI workflow that does the heavy lifting. You just review and send. Sponsors tend to stick once you have a relationship going.\n\nEnd result: $2k/month for a couple hours of work a week. That’s the goal anyway.\n\nIf you want to go bigger — $15k, $50k, $1M/month (yes those newsletters exist) — that’s a whole different level of effort. But that’s not what this post is about.\n\nStarted writing this thinking it’d be 200 words. Oops.\n\nDrop any questions in the comments, happy to answer. Proofs going in comments too 👇​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

          "text": "$200 in 2 weeks is cute but everyone in here is pretending that means \"serious money\" and its not. Beehiiv ad network payouts are basically lunch money until you have real volume, and \"1-2 hours a week\" is only true if youre fine publishing generic recap slop. Also the \"dont attach your name\" thing is backwards for most newbies: trust sells, faceless newsletters get ignored unless youre already buying subs with Meta ads or Boosts. The hard part isnt picking \"finance for single moms\", its distribution that doesnt die after your first 3 Reddit posts.",

      "text": "Hey, this is just a shower thought. If businesses are already doing this then great but I just haven't seen it yet:\n\nHow about a subscription plan that gets cheaper the longer you're subscribed and thus rewards you for staying loyal to the business/brand? Let's be real: the economy sucks. While money is getting tighter, everything's becoming a subscription. If you're trying a subscription model, you're competing with a dozen other subscriptions. The customer's probably very hesitant to add one more to set and forget, so why not make the decision easier?\n\nMany services, when you cancel, will beg you to stay with a super marked-down price for like two or three months. From my perspective at least, when they pull this it feels like someone promising really hard to change when you wanna cut things off... only to go back to the same shit. Why not build a relationship with the customer before that: say \"hey, if you join us and stay with us, we'll hog less of your wallet.\"\n\nNow, obviously it wouldn't go down to $0. Maybe in a year a monthly subscription incrementally goes from $10 to $5 and stays that way. The point is that the customer sees value not just in the subscription and service but continuing to stick with it. Dropping the subscription would feel like throwing away a long-term benefit.\n\nI imagine this pressure would lead to higher retention. Sure some people are paying less but those are the people that stay, the people you can rely on the most.\n\nYou could probably handle cancellation however you want but personally I wouldn't cut off the benefit immediately; maybe just incrementally increase the subscription price each month they're away until it's back to the original.\n\nI don't really have anything I'd use this model for. I freelance articles and those prices are based on word count. I'm working on a webcomic and I'd probably just ask for donations each month in exchange for early releases and bonus content. But if anyone else thinks this is a good idea and wants to try it (or is doing it already), tell me how it goes! If you think it sucks, the downvote button is right there lol.",

If users clearly see how much they’re saving over time and what they unlock by staying, it can turn into a psychological win rather than just a pricing trick. I’d also test it with a small group first to see how it impacts churn versus margins, because sustainability matters as much as creativity here.\n\nWhen I was experimenting with a similar concept, having a simple runnable setup where users could log in and track their progress made a big difference in engagement. I used Runable for that part and it helped me get early feedback quickly. Just sharing what worked for me.",

But why would a business choose to be less profitable - when you can still cancel anytime.\n\nYes, the customer can cancel at any time, but if you compare two plans for the exact same service, economically a customer has less reason to cancel a $10 monthly subscription that becomes $5, than a $10 subscription that will always be $10. I guess it'd be akin to a growth-first model that tries to expand the customer base at expense of profit.\n\nAlso the variables can change depending on what's feasible. Maybe instead of going down to $5 it goes down to $7, or instead of going down over the course of a year it goes down over two years, or three.\n\n>Now a cheaper subscription to guarantee you remain a customer — like annual deals vs monthly are common already.\n\nYeah, there are annual deals, but they're not predicated on loyalty and will still spook your wallet. $100 seems steep whether it's 10% off, 20% off, 50% off, et cetera. As a first time subscriber, you don't know whether you're actually gonna need it or use it that much. Monthly savings over time requires less perceived upfront commitment from the customer.\n\n>Existing customers are a businesses most profitable center, they aren’t gonna shrink the golden goose.\n\n[It's already shrinking.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-subscription-era-is-over-the-purge-has-begun-in-america/) That's why cord-cutting services are becoming popular (while ironically also asking for subscriptions). This decade has been defined by a lot of economic uncertainty, so hard choices have to be made. I think it's more profitable to have a customer that pays a few dollars less a month than a customer that axes the expense altogether when they don't have a few extra dollars. That's why companies will beg you to stay at a significantly lower price if you threaten to cancel.",

My goal is simple: become financially stable first, then grow from there.\n\nMy biggest issue is execution.\n\nI can research, plan, and generate ideas. But when it comes to launching and handling risk, I hesitate — mainly because I don’t have financial backup to absorb losses.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n* Looked into dropshipping — realized it requires ad spend and risk tolerance I currently don’t have.\n* Built SaaS projects — development is manageable, but marketing and customer acquisition feel overwhelming without budget.\n* Considered brokerage/middleman models — low capital, but requires strong communication skills (which I’m still improving).\n* Tried freelancing — very competitive as a beginner.\n* Considered social media — but I prefer building something private and scalable rather than personality-driven.\n\nI’m not looking for shortcuts or “get rich quick” ideas.  \nI’m looking for realistic direction.\n\nIf you were starting from:\n\n* Almost zero capital\n* No strong network\n* Limited risk tolerance\n* Beginner-level communication skills\n\nWhat would be the most logical first step to build stability?\n\nShould I:\n\n* Focus on building a skill first?\n* Get a job and stack capital?\n* Start a small service business?\n* Something else entirely?\n\nI’m open to honest feedback — even if it’s tough to hear.\n\nIf you’ve been in a similar situation and managed to build something sustainable, I’d really value your perspective.\n\nThanks for reading.",

I am an Air Force Veteran who was discharged as a result of an accident that happened while i was in service. As a result i experienced temporary homelessness but had enough mentors and support system around me to keep me motivated and not give up. After years and years of going through treatment and fighting the VA, i finally received what i deserved. Since then, not only have i worked for a medical consulting company helping veterans with their claims but have spent my personal time volunteering and helping advice Veterans on their own claims(no longer my day job but something i do for fun).\n\nAs a non technical founder, i was able to somehow build an MVP/prototype platform that a handful of veteran are using for absolutely free. My end goal? Be the National Infrastructure for all things related to Veteran Preparedness starting with VA benefits.  Lofty goal, i know but someone has to claim it so why not me. Other competitors are charging Veterans for the education which to me is absurd and is the reason why i hope to disrupt the market by offering my services for absolutely FREE to all veterans. SO who will my paying customers be? Legal firms, medical consulting companies, accredited organizations, Veteran Service Officers, and the VA themselves. \n\nAm i currently profitable? Heck no...in fact i am in the red but with the feedback ive been getting from my free users, i know i am headed in the right direction. My main goal for now is getting enough Veterans using my platform, find value in it, share it, spread the word out and eventually those other organizations will take me seriously.\n\nThere is a quote that says \"If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything\"  I stand with the Veteran community and others who are or have ever worn a Uniform in support of this Great Nation. This platform is something i am passionate about and willing to keep going at it even if i never get a single paying customer.\n\nSo to answer your question: How Do I Actually Build Something? Find something you are extremely passionate about, identify a well known problem regarding passion, come up with a solution that will serve others who share similar interest in your passion, go balls to the wall doing it and hang on for dear life.\n\nHope this helps, and best of luck.  Feel free reaching out and keeping in touch. We can do this!!!",

          "text": "This is not exactly business advice as I'm still making 0 profit from this, but since you are considering SaaS, I'm assuming you have some development experience or skills, so one very low budget option is static websites. I have very limited budget and zero network like you, so I'm currently trying to go with static websites now.\n\nSome of the advantages are:\n\n\\- They are much cheaper than full stack SaaS. It depends on your hosting provider, but you might end up paying just for your domain, which can be 10 to 30 dollars a year.\n\n\\- They are also much more secure than full stack SaaS, since they have no backend and expose less surface for potential attacks.\n\n\\- They are much easier to build than full stack SaaS. Since they have no backend, you are basically building only the frontend, with no databases to integrate, no user authentication or authorization, no complex (and potentially expensive) backend logic, etc.\n\nSome of the downsides are:\n\n\\- They may be less profitable than SaaS, because you usually have fewer monetization options\n\n\\- Huge competition: since static sites are relatively easier to build, the barrier to entry into this kind of business is very low\n\n\\- Less flexibility: with a static site, you basically have a frontend-only website, so what you can offer is limited to what a frontend-only website can do. For your reference, blogs, product reviews, courses, mini-games, news articles, online portfolios and advertising for existing businesses are the typical applications of static websites.\n\n\\- AI can potentially kill your business. A lot of people today just search through AI models, they don't visit websites directly, so this may kill your traffic. There are options for charging AIs to use your content, but this is still a huge risk.\n\nMarketing is always hard, not only for static websites. SEO is basically free ads for your site, it gives you a big help, but it's extremely hard to get to the top search results, so I would consider social media and active advertisement as well. Not necessarily paid advertisement. For example, you can try to find groups or communities online that are having an issue that your website can solve, and you can offer to give them a hand. It's not easy, but that's an option.\n\nIf you have no ideas for building your own website, you can also build websites for clients. Maybe try freelancing or look for local businesses who may need one (maybe not necessarily a new one, they may also need to improve the website they already have), but in this case you have to first become more familiar with the technology, because businesses may be less forgiving on your mistakes.\n\nOnce again, don't take this as business advice. I've launched two static websites last year, and I haven't earned a single dollar yet, so this may as well be guaranteed failure. But I'm seeing an increase in traffic to my websites, so I thought of suggesting this to you.",

Don’t over-engineer, just get something live in a day or two.\n\n2) Treat each page as a landing page, not an article. Clear pain, clear outcome, one CTA (email form, lead magnet, calculator, etc.). Static doesn’t mean passive.\n\n3) For “free” marketing, I use Ahrefs Webmaster Tools for basic SEO checks, Google Search Console to see what I’m actually ranking for, and Pulse for Reddit in the background to surface threads where people are already asking about the exact problem my page solves so I can jump in naturally.\n\nPoint is: keep the tech simple, obsess over one tiny use case, and use communities + search data to guide what you build next.",

I think a lot of investors bought these models only to realize there is not enough margin for absentee ownership and are selling on the cheap.

One day my father called me wanting to buy a car from eu and import it to the set country once we did that I realized that there is a huge gap in supply for cars in that region with huge markups that reaches to pretty much 2x in luxury vehicles \n\nObviously started slow and don’t want to export cars from my eu country because once I did the market research I found out that Chinese cars are way cheaper to export and higher in the markup imported two with documentations and everything and ended up making 70% on my money in around three months ( the length of shipping the cars from china) now I’m kind of stuck if and want to know if I should scale up start an import export company what’s the right move here ",

We’ve heard that an LLC is a good idea for protection, but we have zero clue how to actually get one set up in Georgia.\n\nIs the paperwork something two people can manage on their own, or is it worth paying someone to do it for us? Also, any Georgia specific quirks or fees we should know about before diving in?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s started an LLC here recently, especially if you were as clueless as we are. Appreciate any advice.\n\nThrough initial research, we originally started with Inc Authority but we got a called yesterday telling us we needed to pay an additional $292 dollars on top of that $182 we’d already paid for documents they claim are required. I can’t find any reference to these documents and the reps tone change when I told him we wouldn’t be paying this extra fee. These forms they claim I didn’t submit but there’s nothing in our portal and no forms were required.\n\nI’ve seen Zenbusiness recommended but after filling out the information I see they are charging us $225 for the GA state fee, the GA state fee is only $105, which they also state on their website.\n\nWe’ve already had a bad experience with registered agents and we’re not keen to jump into another situation.",

Biggest thing is if you want to have yourself as the registered agent or pay for someone to be one for you. Only difference is really if you get served for some reason it would go to the registered agent instead of you which can be nice for privacy but I'd research agents if you go that route as some are notoriously bad and do not let you know if you have been served. The cost isn't expensive to do this yourself you will get tons of soliciting for filling a new business telling you need this and that and they are required by law to tell you if it's a solicitation. For food I'm not to sure I am a saas service so there might be some difference but probably not to big. I'd recommend finding some food trucks and talking to them as they will probably have the best info for you. Another thing to note is you have to file a BOI with FinCEN it is free but required by the government, basically just says who owns the business to prevent money laundering this was newly required last year and comes and goes when they require it vs not needing it.",

Customers will be able to either walk into the store or order through a website or app for same-day delivery within a defined area. In addition, small but time-sensitive services such as screen guard replacement, camera lens replacement, minor fixes, and pickup-and-drop repairs can be booked as home services, making the business convenience-first rather than location-dependent.To focus on Retention a structured loyalty system will encourage repeat behavior: early visits will provide small, cost-controlled rewards, and completing the cycle will upgrade customers to a “Gold” status that offers priority handling, smoother service, and ongoing small privileges, shifting retention from discounts to relationship and trust. \n\nshare any advice if you have, help me to grow with your advice.",

Right now, I’m trying to decide between two main approaches: importing raw materials and producing locally, or working with manufacturers in China to produce fully customized inflatable tents under my own brand.\n\nI’ve been browsing B2B platforms like Alibaba, and it seems like many suppliers offer customization options such as fabric thickness, air beam design, valves, colors, logos, and packaging. At the same time, I’m aware there can be risks around quality control, communication, minimum order quantities, and long lead times.\n\nFor those who’ve imported outdoor gear or inflatable products, what were the biggest challenges you faced early on? How did you vet suppliers and ensure consistent quality? Would you recommend starting with small customized orders from overseas, or sourcing materials and assembling locally to begin with?\n\nAny insights on costs, certifications, branding, or mistakes to avoid would be really appreciated.",

Inflatable structures look simple, but they are manufacturing heavy and quality sensitive.\nA manufacturing nightmare literally! \n\nBefore choosing China vs local assembly, the first question is: where are you planning to sell? TG Location changes everything.\n\nIf your primary market is the US or Europe, certifications, fire retardancy standards, liability insurance and product testing become serious. If you are looking at India or Southeast Asia, the cost structure and compliance layer is different, but logistics and service becomes the bigger differentiator.\n\nSecondly, do not think just supplier, think failure mode.\n\nWith inflatable tents, your brand will be judged on:\n\n– seam strength\n– air beam reliability\n– valve durability\n– repairability\n– after sales support \nand other customer centric/specific experience. One bad batch can kill early traction.\n\nPersonally, I would not start with large customized MOQs from overseas. I would:\n\n1. Validate demand with a small, tight SKU line.\n\n2. Order samples from 2 to 3 shortlisted suppliers and stress test them aggressively.\n\n3. Understand landed cost including freight, duties, warehousing and defect rate. Also, any unplanned expenses that might show up. \n\n4. Decide whether you want to be a brand or a product company.\n\nThere is a big difference.\n\nAlso, emergency and temporary shelter is a completely different buyer compared to outdoor leisure. Mixing these two verticals at the early stage is not recommended. \n\nIf you are open to sharing which geography you are targeting and what price band you are aiming for, happy to share more specific thoughts. This is one of those businesses where early structural decisions determine whether you build a brand or just import inventory. I hope this helps..",

The more I dig into this, the more I realize this isn’t just “find a factory and add a logo.” There are structural decisions here that will define the whole direction of the business.\n\nRight now I’m leaning toward focusing on one specific use case instead of trying to cover both emergency and leisure markets. The customer expectations and buying psychology are completely different, and I don’t want to dilute positioning early on.\n\nThe geography question is something I’m actively evaluating. My initial thought is to target a market where I can realistically support after-sales service instead of just shipping products and hoping for the best. Long-term, I’d rather build something known for reliability and support than compete purely on price.\n\nAppreciate you taking the time to break this down.
