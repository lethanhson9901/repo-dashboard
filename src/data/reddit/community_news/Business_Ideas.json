      "text": "I made $200 in the last 2 weeks from mine. Proof in comments if you don’t believe me.\n\nMy goal is $2k/month by end of year. And no, I’m not going hard on this, I’m putting in maybe 1-2 hours a week. So that’s why it’ll take 10 months instead of 2. Slow and steady but basically passive so I’m not complaining.\n\nAnyway here’s what I’m doing if you want to copy it:\n\nNiche first\n\nFinance pays the best CPMs but don’t just do “finance.” Go specific. Finance for single moms, stock market for complete beginners, that kind of thing. AI is also a solid bet right now, it’s genuinely exploding. Health, dating, local news — all work too. Just pick something and commit.\n\nBuild it like a company not a diary\n\nSeriously don’t attach your name to it. You want something you could sell one day. A newsletter with your name on it is a freelance gig. A newsletter brand is an actual asset. Different things.\n\nPlatform\n\nSubstack is free and fine for starting. I use beehiiv. Better customization and they have their own ad network built in, which means you can monetize from day 1 without finding a single sponsor yourself. That alone sold me on it.\n\nGetting subscribers\n\nThis is where most people get stuck. Options are:\n\nMeta ads — reliable but expensive. beehiiv has a paid boost feature too where other newsletters basically send their readers your way. Both cost money though.\n\nFree route is content. X, LinkedIn, Reddit. Reddit has been my main thing. I post about side hustles, people find value in it, they subscribe. Got around 150 new subs just last week from Reddit. This exact type of post is how I do it.\n\nSending issues\n\nJust send consistently. AI helps a lot with organizing and formatting but you still have to know how to use it properly or the output is terrible. I use it as a tool not a ghostwriter.\n\n(Writing this post myself by the way, hence the grammar crimes lol)\n\nMoney\n\nSmall newsletter? Use the beehiiv ad network. I’m at 2k subscribers and making $15-20 per issue from it. Not retiring off it but I’m sending the newsletter anyway so it’s basically found money.\n\nHit 5k and you can start going after real sponsors — $100 to $400 per placement depending on your niche. That’s when it gets genuinely interesting.\n\nYou can also do digital products or affiliate stuff on top of that. Multiple streams from the same audience.\n\nAutopilot\n\nOnce you’re at 5k, set up a beehiiv boost at like $1.50-$2 per subscriber. Keep some budget running and you get new subscribers without doing anything.\n\nFor the actual issues, either get a VA or build out an AI workflow that does the heavy lifting. You just review and send. Sponsors tend to stick once you have a relationship going.\n\nEnd result: $2k/month for a couple hours of work a week. That’s the goal anyway.\n\nIf you want to go bigger — $15k, $50k, $1M/month (yes those newsletters exist) — that’s a whole different level of effort. But that’s not what this post is about.\n\nStarted writing this thinking it’d be 200 words. Oops.\n\nDrop any questions in the comments, happy to answer. Proofs going in comments too 👇​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Wyoming LLC formation (\\~$99 via InCorp for example) + registered agent (\\~$129/year) = under $230 total. That's your cost base.\n\nBut foreigners don't do it themselves because the process has some issues\n\n1. EIN can't be applied online without a US SSN. Non-residents fax Form SS-4 and wait 2-5 weeks (one wrong field = start over) 2) Foreign-owned LLCs must file Form 5472 annually or face a $25K IRS penalty - most people find out *after* the fact 3) Opening a US bank account as a non-resident has gotten significantly harder since 2024\n\nNone of this is complicated. It's just confusing and terrifying if English isn't your first language.\n\nThe business: \"done for you\" setup service. You handle everything, charge $400-600, keep $200-400 margin per client. But the real opportunity is going niche - Spanish-speaking founders, Indians dealing with FEMA compliance, Nigerians locked out of Stripe Atlas. Each is an underserved community with zero localized competition.\n\nThe knowledge barrier is real but learnable. And for these clients, a US LLC isn't a nice-to-have - it's the difference between getting paid or not.\n\nAm I missing something?? I think it's to good to be true, that's why I'm asking you to give some feedback",

          "text": "It’s not “too good to be true”, but it’s not as simple as it looks.\n\nA few realities you should think about:\n\n**1. Compliance risk is real.**  \nIf you mess up EIN, 5472, BOI reporting, or state filings, you’re not just losing a client, you’re exposing them to penalties. That $25k 5472 fine isn’t theoretical. You’ll need airtight processes and probably legal/accounting backing.\n\n**2. Banking is the real bottleneck.**  \nLLC formation is easy. Getting a usable US bank account without visiting physically is getting harder. If you can’t reliably solve that, your offer weakens.\n\n**3. Trust > pricing.**  \nForeign founders wiring $500+ to someone abroad need extreme trust signals, content, testimonials, community presence. This is a credibility business.\n\n**4. Long-term liability.**  \nAre you just forming LLCs? Or are you becoming their de facto compliance advisor every year? Recurring filings are opportunity… but also responsibility.\n\nThe niche angle (Spanish founders, Indian devs, etc.) is smart. But this is closer to a regulated services business than a simple arbitrage play.\n\nThe opportunity is real. The risk is in execution and liability, not demand.",

But when it comes to launching and handling risk, I hesitate — mainly because I don’t have financial backup to absorb losses.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n* Looked into dropshipping — realized it requires ad spend and risk tolerance I currently don’t have.\n* Built SaaS projects — development is manageable, but marketing and customer acquisition feel overwhelming without budget.\n* Considered brokerage/middleman models — low capital, but requires strong communication skills (which I’m still improving).\n* Tried freelancing — very competitive as a beginner.\n* Considered social media — but I prefer building something private and scalable rather than personality-driven.\n\nI’m not looking for shortcuts or “get rich quick” ideas.  \nI’m looking for realistic direction.\n\nIf you were starting from:\n\n* Almost zero capital\n* No strong network\n* Limited risk tolerance\n* Beginner-level communication skills\n\nWhat would be the most logical first step to build stability?\n\nShould I:\n\n* Focus on building a skill first?\n* Get a job and stack capital?\n* Start a small service business?\n* Something else entirely?\n\nI’m open to honest feedback — even if it’s tough to hear.\n\nIf you’ve been in a similar situation and managed to build something sustainable, I’d really value your perspective.\n\nThanks for reading.",

          "text": "Find something you are extremely passionate about that way even if it never works out you will have satisfaction doing it. Ex. I am an Air Force Veteran who was discharged as a result of an accident that happened while i was in service. As a result i experienced temporary homelessness but had enough mentors and support system around me to keep me motivated and not give up. After years and years of going through treatment and fighting the VA, i finally received what i deserved. Since then, not only have i worked for a medical consulting company helping veterans with their claims but have spent my personal time volunteering and helping advice Veterans on their own claims(no longer my day job but something i do for fun).\n\nAs a non technical founder, i was able to somehow build an MVP/prototype platform that a handful of veteran are using for absolutely free. My end goal? Be the National Infrastructure for all things related to Veteran Preparedness starting with VA benefits.  Lofty goal, i know but someone has to claim it so why not me. Other competitors are charging Veterans for the education which to me is absurd and is the reason why i hope to disrupt the market by offering my services for absolutely FREE to all veterans. SO who will my paying customers be? Legal firms, medical consulting companies, accredited organizations, Veteran Service Officers, and the VA themselves. \n\nAm i currently profitable? Heck no...in fact i am in the red but with the feedback ive been getting from my free users, i know i am headed in the right direction. My main goal for now is getting enough Veterans using my platform, find value in it, share it, spread the word out and eventually those other organizations will take me seriously.\n\nThere is a quote that says \"If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything\"  I stand with the Veteran community and others who are or have ever worn a Uniform in support of this Great Nation. This platform is something i am passionate about and willing to keep going at it even if i never get a single paying customer.\n\nSo to answer your question: How Do I Actually Build Something? Find something you are extremely passionate about, identify a well known problem regarding passion, come up with a solution that will serve others who share similar interest in your passion, go balls to the wall doing it and hang on for dear life.\n\nHope this helps, and best of luck.  Feel free reaching out and keeping in touch. We can do this!!!",

          "text": "This is not exactly business advice as I'm still making 0 profit from this, but since you are considering SaaS, I'm assuming you have some development experience or skills, so one very low budget option is static websites. I have very limited budget and zero network like you, so I'm currently trying to go with static websites now.\n\nSome of the advantages are:\n\n\\- They are much cheaper than full stack SaaS. It depends on your hosting provider, but you might end up paying just for your domain, which can be 10 to 30 dollars a year.\n\n\\- They are also much more secure than full stack SaaS, since they have no backend and expose less surface for potential attacks.\n\n\\- They are much easier to build than full stack SaaS. Since they have no backend, you are basically building only the frontend, with no databases to integrate, no user authentication or authorization, no complex (and potentially expensive) backend logic, etc.\n\nSome of the downsides are:\n\n\\- They may be less profitable than SaaS, because you usually have fewer monetization options\n\n\\- Huge competition: since static sites are relatively easier to build, the barrier to entry into this kind of business is very low\n\n\\- Less flexibility: with a static site, you basically have a frontend-only website, so what you can offer is limited to what a frontend-only website can do. For your reference, blogs, product reviews, courses, mini-games, news articles, online portfolios and advertising for existing businesses are the typical applications of static websites.\n\n\\- AI can potentially kill your business. A lot of people today just search through AI models, they don't visit websites directly, so this may kill your traffic. There are options for charging AIs to use your content, but this is still a huge risk.\n\nMarketing is always hard, not only for static websites. SEO is basically free ads for your site, it gives you a big help, but it's extremely hard to get to the top search results, so I would consider social media and active advertisement as well. Not necessarily paid advertisement. For example, you can try to find groups or communities online that are having an issue that your website can solve, and you can offer to give them a hand. It's not easy, but that's an option.\n\nIf you have no ideas for building your own website, you can also build websites for clients. Maybe try freelancing or look for local businesses who may need one (maybe not necessarily a new one, they may also need to improve the website they already have), but in this case you have to first become more familiar with the technology, because businesses may be less forgiving on your mistakes.\n\nOnce again, don't take this as business advice. I've launched two static websites last year, and I haven't earned a single dollar yet, so this may as well be guaranteed failure. But I'm seeing an increase in traffic to my websites, so I thought of suggesting this to you.",

Don’t over-engineer, just get something live in a day or two.\n\n2) Treat each page as a landing page, not an article. Clear pain, clear outcome, one CTA (email form, lead magnet, calculator, etc.). Static doesn’t mean passive.\n\n3) For “free” marketing, I use Ahrefs Webmaster Tools for basic SEO checks, Google Search Console to see what I’m actually ranking for, and Pulse for Reddit in the background to surface threads where people are already asking about the exact problem my page solves so I can jump in naturally.\n\nPoint is: keep the tech simple, obsess over one tiny use case, and use communities + search data to guide what you build next.",

Something like Junk King can give you processes to follow, support in execution and practically eliminate many areas that you find difficult. My tip would not be to buy directly from the franchisor, but see if you can buy from someone who thought they could be an absentee owner and is selling their equipment and franchise for under $100k. I think a lot of investors bought these models only to realize there is not enough margin for absentee ownership and are selling on the cheap. I have no affiliation with junk king but I am very familiar with the industry. ",

I live in india and 80% of the furniture market is unorganized with no brands still. I was thinking of making a business that only has tables. Y'all seen those trendy side tables which look likes dice. I was thinking of starting something as such.\n\nA good collection of Side tables- Designed with modern themes(like those chess board tables), inbuilt charging sockets, equipped with lamps and whatnot.\n\nA lot could be done with these honestly. And I think it can be sold if marketing and branding is done well. Main problem is with margins. I am not sure what margins I can save for cashflow. Knowing that logistics would eat a lot of it so I need to know if it's a profitable and scalable business.  \nCan anyone give me an idea about what Net margins i can expect. And what are the problems with furniture business?",

Start a body of work.\n\nPick one specific angle - tech writing, self-improvement for students, software tutorials - and publish 8-10 pieces. Medium, Substack, or LinkedIn. Free. No branding needed yet. You're testing what gets traction and what you can sustain.\n\nDays 31-60: Find one person to help for free.\n\nBuild something, write something, solve something for a real human.

We’ve heard that an LLC is a good idea for protection, but we have zero clue how to actually get one set up in Georgia.\n\nIs the paperwork something two people can manage on their own, or is it worth paying someone to do it for us? Also, any Georgia specific quirks or fees we should know about before diving in?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s started an LLC here recently, especially if you were as clueless as we are. Appreciate any advice.\n\nThrough initial research, we originally started with Inc Authority but we got a called yesterday telling us we needed to pay an additional $292 dollars on top of that $182 we’d already paid for documents they claim are required. I can’t find any reference to these documents and the reps tone change when I told him we wouldn’t be paying this extra fee. These forms they claim I didn’t submit but there’s nothing in our portal and no forms were required.\n\nI’ve seen Zenbusiness recommended but after filling out the information I see they are charging us $225 for the GA state fee, the GA state fee is only $105, which they also state on their website.\n\nWe’ve already had a bad experience with registered agents and we’re not keen to jump into another situation.",

Biggest thing is if you want to have yourself as the registered agent or pay for someone to be one for you. Only difference is really if you get served for some reason it would go to the registered agent instead of you which can be nice for privacy but I'd research agents if you go that route as some are notoriously bad and do not let you know if you have been served. The cost isn't expensive to do this yourself you will get tons of soliciting for filling a new business telling you need this and that and they are required by law to tell you if it's a solicitation. For food I'm not to sure I am a saas service so there might be some difference but probably not to big. I'd recommend finding some food trucks and talking to them as they will probably have the best info for you. Another thing to note is you have to file a BOI with FinCEN it is free but required by the government, basically just says who owns the business to prevent money laundering this was newly required last year and comes and goes when they require it vs not needing it.",

It must be unique and have the words \"\"LLC\"\" or \"\"Limited Liability Company\"\" in it.\n\n2. Registered Agent: Your LLC will need a registered agent to sign for legal papers. A person or a business can be a registered agent.\n\n3. File Articles of Organization: This is the most important paper you need to start your LLC. You will send it to the Georgia Secretary of State, and the fee to file it is $100. This can be done online.\n\n4.An operating agreement is not mandatory in Georgia; however, it is advisable to have one in order to delineate the operations of your LLC and prevent potential issues.\n\n5. Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN) An Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS is required in order to employ personnel or establish a separate business bank account. This can be accomplished for free via the internet.\n\n6. Sign up for state taxes: If your business sells goods or services, you need to sign up for sales tax with the Georgia Department of Revenue.\n\n7. Annual Registration: You have to pay $50 each year to file your annual registration. It's due on the same day as the anniversary of your LLC's formation.\n\nNeed Help?\nYou can do all of this on your own, but if you'd rather not have to deal with any surprises or extra fees, you might want to think about using a service like BusinessAnywhere. I have personally employed them and was impressed by the simplicity and clarity of their process.They helped me with everything and made sure there were no surprise charges. If you're not sure you can handle all the paperwork on your own, this is definitely something to think about. I hope everything goes well with your mobile food cart! It sounds like a fun and interesting project.",

You just never know... especially in the food industry.\n\nYou can definitely file everything yourself on the Georgia Secretary of State website. Filing yourself is pretty easy, if you list yourself as registered agent, your address will be listed publicly. \n\nSince it's a mobile food cart, I'm assuming you'd list your home address. If you decided to do this, please look into what you're agreeing to by being your own registered agent in Georgia. I personally think that hiring a registered agent service for your Georgia LLC is better as it will keep your address of public records and also give you peace of mind. ",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nIf planning to start a technical services company in the UAE (likely in areas like MEP, maintenance, or construction support), and how decide on the hiring model.\n\nWould it be better to:\n\n1. Hire employees directly or\n2. Partner with a manpower supply company and outsource staffing?\n\nFrom what I understand:\n\nDirect hiring gives more control over quality and company culture.\n\nManpower supply services may reduce administrative workload and upfront costs.\n\nUAE labour laws, visa processing, and compliance can be complex for new businesses.\n\nMy main concerns are: cost efficiency, Scalability as projects increase, Legal compliance and risk management, Long term profitability\n\nFor those who have started businesses in the UAE, especially in technical or construction related fields, what worked better for you and why?\n\nAppreciate any real world insights",

          "text": "For technical services in the UAE, both hiring models have pros and cons. Direct hiring gives control over quality and culture but comes with higher admin, visa, and compliance responsibilities. Manpower supply/outsourcing reduces administrative load and upfront costs, but can limit control over quality and alignment with your company. Many businesses use a hybrid approach: a core team hired directly, plus outsourced staff for project-based scalability. If you’re looking for guidance on UAE labour compliance, visa processing, and efficient staffing solutions, our services help businesses like yours hire the right people while managing legal and administrative risks, ensuring cost-efficient, scalable operations. Happy to share examples of how technical/construction companies structured their teams in Dubai!",

      "text": "I’m exploring the idea of starting a small inflatable tent brand and wanted to get some advice from people who’ve been down a similar path or have manufacturing experience.\n\nThe concept is to focus on durable, easy-to-set-up inflatable tents for outdoor use, events, or even emergency and temporary shelter applications. Right now, I’m trying to decide between two main approaches: importing raw materials and producing locally, or working with manufacturers in China to produce fully customized inflatable tents under my own brand.\n\nI’ve been browsing B2B platforms like Alibaba, and it seems like many suppliers offer customization options such as fabric thickness, air beam design, valves, colors, logos, and packaging. At the same time, I’m aware there can be risks around quality control, communication, minimum order quantities, and long lead times.\n\nFor those who’ve imported outdoor gear or inflatable products, what were the biggest challenges you faced early on? How did you vet suppliers and ensure consistent quality? Would you recommend starting with small customized orders from overseas, or sourcing materials and assembling locally to begin with?\n\nAny insights on costs, certifications, branding, or mistakes to avoid would be really appreciated.",

          "text": "I am glad that you are thinking through this before jumping in. Inflatable structures look simple, but they are manufacturing heavy and quality sensitive.\nA manufacturing nightmare literally! \n\nBefore choosing China vs local assembly, the first question is: where are you planning to sell? TG Location changes everything.\n\nIf your primary market is the US or Europe, certifications, fire retardancy standards, liability insurance and product testing become serious. If you are looking at India or Southeast Asia, the cost structure and compliance layer is different, but logistics and service becomes the bigger differentiator.\n\nSecondly, do not think just supplier, think failure mode.\n\nWith inflatable tents, your brand will be judged on:\n\n– seam strength\n– air beam reliability\n– valve durability\n– repairability\n– after sales support \nand other customer centric/specific experience. One bad batch can kill early traction.\n\nPersonally, I would not start with large customized MOQs from overseas. I would:\n\n1. Validate demand with a small, tight SKU line.\n\n2. Order samples from 2 to 3 shortlisted suppliers and stress test them aggressively.\n\n3. Understand landed cost including freight, duties, warehousing and defect rate. Also, any unplanned expenses that might show up. \n\n4. Decide whether you want to be a brand or a product company.\n\nThere is a big difference.\n\nAlso, emergency and temporary shelter is a completely different buyer compared to outdoor leisure. Mixing these two verticals at the early stage is not recommended. \n\nIf you are open to sharing which geography you are targeting and what price band you are aiming for, happy to share more specific thoughts. This is one of those businesses where early structural decisions determine whether you build a brand or just import inventory. I hope this helps..",

The more I dig into this, the more I realize this isn’t just “find a factory and add a logo.” There are structural decisions here that will define the whole direction of the business.\n\nRight now I’m leaning toward focusing on one specific use case instead of trying to cover both emergency and leisure markets. The customer expectations and buying psychology are completely different, and I don’t want to dilute positioning early on.\n\nThe geography question is something I’m actively evaluating. My initial thought is to target a market where I can realistically support after-sales service instead of just shipping products and hoping for the best. Long-term, I’d rather build something known for reliability and support than compete purely on price.\n\nAppreciate you taking the time to break this down. It definitely gives me more to think through before making any big commitments.",

I know the quality of the socks themselves matters, but packaging and branding play a huge role in shaping customer perception.\n\n\nI’m exploring ideas like minimalistic packaging, eco-friendly materials, and branded boxes or sleeves. I’m also looking at sourcing packaging from bulk B2B suppliers such as Alibaba, Uline, Packlane, and Paper Mart. One of the challenges I’m running into is comparing prices and minimum order quantities across these suppliers to find options that feel high-end without going over budget.\n\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who has experience with premium sock brands or small apparel startups:\n•\tWhat elements made the brand feel high-end to you as a customer?\n•\tDo you have any tips for sourcing packaging from bulk suppliers while keeping quality premium?\n•\tAre there any mistakes I should avoid in the early stages when picking packaging or suppliers?\n\n\nThanks so much for any advice or insights you can share",

One strong color palette, minimal copy, heavier stock band or sleeve, and clean typography. No clutter, no five bullet point feature lists. the weight and texture of the paper often matter more than adding another insert.\n\nBefore you go deep on custom boxes, test unit economics. A rigid box can eat your margin fast, especially with shipping. I’ve seen early apparel brands lock into high MOQs on packaging, then pivot the brand slightly and get stuck with dead inventory. If I were you, I’d prototype small batches with 2 to 3 packaging styles and get real customer feedback. Ask what made it feel premium or cheap. Let perception data guide you before you commit to a big print run.",
