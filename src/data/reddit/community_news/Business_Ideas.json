      "text": "I analyze regulatory signals to track **\"Unfair Gaps\"** — specific operational points where businesses are legally or structurally forced to lose money. Most founders look for \"ideas\". I look for verified liabilities.\n\nHere are 3 validated gaps from today's analysis.\n\n**1. The \"Customs Bottleneck\" (International Trade)**\n\n* **Pain:** Lost operational capacity and throughput from manual HS classification holds.\n* **The Unfair Gap:** Opportunity cost equivalent to lost throughput. For large traders, misclassification-driven holds defer millions in goods from reaching markets, freezing capital on the water.\n* **Context:** Classification depends on a small pool of human experts. When they are unavailable or make an error, it triggers customs inspections that reduce the effective capacity of ports and transport assets.\n* **Opportunity:** Automated HS Classification API that interprets rulings and validates shipment manifests *before* they leave the warehouse.\n\n**2. The \"Rework Tax\" (Ambulance Services)**\n\n* **Pain:** Rework and rebilling costs due to incomplete claim data (missing modifiers/mileage).\n* **The Unfair Gap:** Rework costs $25–$50 per claim internally. For an agency with thousands of Medicare claims, this translates into six-figure annual losses in avoidable labor and delayed cash flow.\n* **Context:** Medicare manuals demand strict adherence to origin/destination modifiers and mileage lines. Field documentation is often inconsistent, and errors are currently caught only *after* the payer denies the claim.\n* **Opportunity:** A \"Pre-Submission Scrubber\" for CMS-1500 forms that validates specific ambulance modifiers against dispatch data.\n\n**3. The \"Recall Drag\" (Wholesale Alcohol)**\n\n* **Pain:** Delayed cash collection due to manual recall credits and reconciliations.\n* **The Unfair Gap:** Financing cost and working-capital drag equal to 1–3% of affected revenue annually. Wholesalers carry the cost of disputed balances while waiting for paper-based reconciliation.\n* **Context:** Recall data (lots, quantities) is trapped in spreadsheets and emails. Wholesalers must reconcile inventory across the three-tier chain (Supplier -> Wholesaler -> Retailer) before they can settle accounts, which takes weeks.\n* **Opportunity:** A centralized \"Recall Reconciliation Platform\" that automates credit issuance and regulatory reporting.\n\n**Summary** I have a database of 3,700+ of these. I plan to share the best ones here regularly. Let me know in the comments which industry you want me to scan next (Construction? Real Estate? Energy?).",

It benefits big developers to keep working capital as long as possible, and small developers outright need it in many cases. The long payment terms can create strain for small suppliers, but it doesn't negatively impact large suppliers enough for them to care as much. If small suppliers tried to change the status quo, large suppliers will get more business just for the longer payment terms (unless there is no large supplier for a product, which can happen but is niche).\n\nYou would have to convince developers/contractors to consciously make their cash flow worse (they won't unless forced to, and sometimes can't even with predictive modeling), which isn't a problem solved with SaaS. It's a banking/credit problem on the developer side and an inability to force (unless you're effectively the only option) problem on the supplier side.",

      "text": "this started because i got laid off from my marketing job last may and had about 6k in savings. instead of immediately job hunting i decided to give myself 4 months to try building something online. spoiler: it took longer than 4 months and the results were… mixed but interesting.\n\nthe idea came from noticing how many travel tiktok and instagram accounts were just stock footage with voiceovers and text overlays. figured i could do that but with a more personal angle, like a fictional travel blogger persona who visits places and gives tips. the twist was i didnt want to be on camera myself. partly privacy concerns, partly just not comfortable with it.\n\nfirst two months were rough. i tried using basic stock footage and canva templates. got maybe 200 followers total across platforms. the content felt generic because it was generic. people could tell it was just repurposed clips they'd seen elsewhere.\n\nmonth three i started experimenting with ai generated visuals. the landscape changed a lot in late 2023 and early 2024 with all these tools popping up. i tried midjourney for location shots which worked okay but the people always looked off. like the face would be slightly different every single generation. one image she'd have a rounder nose, next image it was more pointed. eyes would shift from hazel to straight up green between posts. followers notice that stuff even if they cant articulate why something feels wrong.\n\nspent probably three weeks testing different platforms. artflow was decent for video stuff. tried APOB for the portrait consistency thing. runway for some motion effects. honestly they all had tradeoffs and i ended up using a combination plus manual photoshop touchups for anything that looked slightly off. the key was getting a character that looked consistent enough that followers wouldnt notice the ai aspect immediately.\n\nby month five i had a system. my fictional persona was a 28 year old woman who travels solo and focuses on budget destinations in southeast asia and eastern europe. i was posting 2 reels per day on instagram and 3 tiktoks. each piece of content took about 25 minutes to make once i had the workflow down.\n\nthe growth was slow but steady. hit 3k followers on instagram around month six. tiktok was more volatile, had one video randomly get 89k views about visiting georgia (the country) on 40 dollars a day. that brought in about 1.2k followers overnight but most of them didnt stick around.\n\nmonth seven i tried monetizing through affiliate links for travel gear and booking platforms. this is where reality hit. made exactly 127 dollars that month. not nothing but definitely not quitting your job money. the issue was engagement. people would watch the content but the trust factor wasnt there for clicking through and buying stuff.\n\nthe moment that really crystallized this for me was when someone commented asking if she could do a live q&a about solo travel safety tips. had like 40 people agree and ask for it in the replies. obviously i couldnt do that. i just replied something vague about being too busy with an upcoming trip and the comment thread died. but it stuck with me because thats exactly the kind of engagement that builds real community and i fundamentally couldnt deliver it. another time someone asked her to collab with their small travel account and i had to ghost the dm. felt bad about that one.\n\nmonth eight, which was last month, i pivoted slightly. instead of trying to be an influencer account i repositioned as a travel tips and hacks page. less focus on the ai persona, more focus on useful information with the visuals just being illustration. engagement actually went up. made 340 dollars in affiliate revenue which still isnt life changing but the trajectory feels better.\n\ncurrent state: still running the accounts as a side project while job hunting. total investment was probably around 800 dollars in software subscriptions and some paid promotions that didnt really work. total revenue so far is just under 600 dollars so im still in the red but learning a lot.\n\nbiggest lessons from this whole thing. first, consistency of a virtual persona matters way more than i expected. even small variations in appearance made comments start asking if this was ai. second, the trust gap is real. people engage with ai generated content but converting that to purchases is harder than with real creators. third, the tools are genuinely impressive now but theyre not magic. you still need good ideas and execution.\n\nnot sure if ill keep going with this or try something completely different. the faceless content model works for some people but i think i underestimated how much parasocial connection drives creator economy businesses. without a real person to root for the ceiling might just be lower.",

      "text": "TL;DR: I run AI Influencers on social media, copy viral trends and videos to go viral, then funnel to paid sites.\n\n\nI'm sure you've heard of this business recently, it's becoming more and more common as the barriers to entry are shrinking.\n\nI have been doing this for about 7 months, making good money so I can even do it full time. You don't even need hardware anymore, no comfy. I use Higgsfield and Wavespeed mainly, and you can probably get enough content with $20-$50/month (depending on how much you generate) and can rven do it from your phone.\n\nThe main contributor to success is consistency + patience. If your Influencer is attractive, she/he will go viral eventually, it may take a couple weeks but it will happen.\n\nI just copy viral dances and thirst traps, then funnel my traffic to paid sites where they can buy content, chat, subscribe etc. \n\nMy Current Workflow:\n1. Generate a base inage in Nanobananapro \n2. Find a reference video (reel or a tiktok) and upload it to Kling Motion Control\n3. Create an image imitatibg the first frame of the reference video, via Nanobananapro (with your base image as a reference)\n4. Combine (without a prompt) in Kling Motion Control\n5. Post consistently daily across TikTok/Instagram/Threads/Reddit\n6. Create a paid subscription site (Patreon/FV etc.)\n7. Funnel social media traffic there via stories and CTAs\n \n\nI'll try answer any questions here :) I have some examples of what I post on my reddit profile ",

Ok you’ll create the content (both SFW and NSFW), you’ll become viral on social media (you have to know how, I mean you’ve to warm up your social media accounts to be able to target only US audience - easy, but you must to have consistency in your work, your account&content should looks authentic, legit. \nYou don’t have to rush because this will be very dangerous for your newly created social media accounts (you can get a shadow ban or even a ban). \nThen in social media you’ll have a rate of conversion that could be a low one or a good one based on what you’re doing. \nYou’ll get subscribers to your Fanvue account, this is the most difficult part. \nYou’ll get people who are willing to pay your subscription fee (4.99-9.99$) but some of them are expecting to see NSFW completely for free. \nThis is why a chatter is very important because she’ll engage with your subscribers and she’ll make them (using a chatting script) to buy over and over your PPV content (the most important sale that you can have on OF, Fansly, Fanvue). \nThe money from subscription fee… are nothing compared with the money that comes from selling content.\n\nSo the business it’s not a childish thing. \n\nWhat OP is trying to do, maybe to sell his method, it’s not my business and if he is good and if he can prove this point (so not just words, talking) it’s like a side source of income for him. \nIf he’ll ask for 30,50$ for this method like a one time price then… I don’t know. \n\nTo answer to someone comment that said that this is not a business that have a future (3 years) - Look the point is that you are not sure about anything nowadays, neither a regular job. Check what’s happening in IT industry. \nIf you have a business, I’m speaking in general, that can generate 10k,20k, 50k $ monthly even for a short period like 6 months - 1 year it’s good enough because if you are not retarded and you’ve your mindset for businesses then you can invest your money in another business. \nThis is about in businesses, to adapt to the changes, to the businesses environment, to the world.",

That does not pierce the corporate veil. Veil issues come from commingling funds, paying personal bills directly from the LLC, sloppy records, undercapitalization, and not treating the business like a separate entity.\n\nA “10% of monthly net profit” draw is fine as a cash management rule, but it does not change your tax bill. You are taxed on the LLC’s profit, whether you withdraw it or not. So the real key is to set aside money for quarterly estimated taxes and keep clean bookkeeping. In a multi-member LLC, profit splits and distributions should match the operating agreement (or be updated in writing).\n\nA fixed salary or hourly paycheck generally only applies if you elect S-corp taxation and run payroll. In that case, you must pay a reasonable salary and then take additional profits as distributions.\n\nRed flags to avoid: mixing accounts, personal expenses in the LLC, undocumented transfers, and taking distributions you cannot support with basis (common in partnerships and S-corps).\n\nBusinessAnywhere note: we see this a lot, and the clean separation and documentation matter more than the exact draw formula.",

Don’t fool yourself into thinking because you set up an LLC, you’ll simply be able to pay yourself 10% profits. A lot of small businesses struggle because they are inadequately funded.

Through it all I bootstrapped my tech companies, I closed big deals, I worked with big brands such as PWC, Teleperformance, L’Óreal, LVMH, Toyota, Fiat, Red Bull, Sony, Epic Games etc… I’ve been the only Developer, Designer and Marketeer and led teams of people and whole departments as CTO. I’ve given talks at Websummit, VivaTech, IGS, AWE and taught classes or gave workshops on colleges and universities.\n\nBut right now I’m facing some really tough times.\n\nInvestment (which I finally turned too) is taking too long to materialize and each day that goes through, the hole I’m in gets deeper and with 3 kids that’s not something you want. So that’s why I’m turning to you all for help.\n\nAll I want is a shot to work my way out of this hole and I’ve got a lot of wisdom and experience building and marketing all kinds of technology as well as living and bootstrapping as an Entrepreneur and I’m available to share it all with you.\n\nSo if you want to know how to build things well or fast or performative, how to implement AI on your business for automation, how to make tech stacks cheaper (I’m really good at finding cheaper alternatives), how to market something, how to price it, how to make a good pitchdeck (i worked with a lot of startups in the past for this), how to make a good presentation, how to speak at an event, or just have a conversation and vent about the VC ecosystem or what not to do as startup, **PLEASE LET’S TALK** and make that time worth for both of us.\n\nAs I said, all I want is a shot to work my way out of this and I have faith in the brotherhood/sisterhood that is the Entrepreneur Community and that you will help me.

The gap between knowing you can execute and just waiting on timing or capital to line up can be brutal, especially with a family depending on you.\n\nWhat stood out to me is that you’ve clearly been in the trenches for a long time. Solo dev, design, marketing, running teams, enterprise clients… that’s not theory, that’s real experience. A lot of people in this space talk a big game but haven’t actually carried that load themselves.\n\nI’m in a bit of a similar headspace at the moment, just coming at it from a different angle, and I’d genuinely be keen to talk. I’m especially interested in how you’ve approached AI in a practical way, not hype stuff but what actually saves time or makes money, and how you’ve kept stacks lean when cash was tight. Also curious how you’ve found the shift from pure bootstrapping to dealing with investors, because that alone can mess with your head.\n\nIf you’re open to it, feel free to DM me. Even a short chat would be worthwhile and if there’s a way to make it mutually useful, whether that’s collaboration or paid work or just pressure testing ideas, even better. Worst case we trade war stories and vent about the ecosystem, which sometimes helps more than people admit.\n\nWishing you some momentum soon. Anyone who’s lasted 15+ years in this game clearly has something most people don’t.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nHope 2026 has started well for you.\n\nI’m currently building DIFM (Do It For Me), a London-first managed home services platform. The product build is already underway with a CTO, and I’m now narrowing in on a number of strong candidates for a GTM / Ops co-founder role.\n\nI’ve spent the last 15 years working hands-on in property maintenance and residential environments in London. I’m building DIFM because this category is massive but structurally broken. Pricing is unclear, fulfilment is unreliable, and customers are left in the dark when something goes wrong. Most platforms fail not because of demand, but because the operating model collapses once real jobs start happening.\n\nWe’re now close to MVP and entering that pre-launch phase where a lot of important but unglamorous work needs doing. This is the kind of work that gives you a real understanding of how startups are actually built. Not theory, not courses, not buzzwords, but real execution and decision-making under constraints.\n\nI’m looking for one switched-on person who wants to work closely with me during this phase.\n\nTo be clear on expectations from the start: this is not a formal job posting and not a corporate role. The commitment is light, flexible, and fully async, designed around existing commitments. It is initially unpaid as we’re pre-revenue and bootstrapped. If it becomes genuinely valuable on both sides, there’s room to formalise things later, either as a paid role once revenue or funding exists, or through equity only if someone ends up taking real, ongoing ownership.\n\nI’m deliberately not listing a rigid set of tasks. Different people bring different strengths. Some are strong at research, some at outreach, some at organisation, some at spotting problems early. I’d rather understand what you’re capable of than force a title on it.\n\nThis probably isn’t a fit if you’re looking for something polished, guaranteed, or highly structured. It is a fit if you’re curious how real businesses are built from the inside and want exposure to actual decisions while something real is going live.\n\nIf this resonates, send me a DM with a short intro, what you’re currently doing, what you’re good at or interested in working on, and a LinkedIn profile or CV.\n\nNo formal process, just a straightforward conversation.\n\nRegardless of whether this is for you or not, wishing everyone a great year ahead!\n\nEddie",

I settled it because I don’t want to waste my time with people who wants to make 10k in the first week and then leave my team because “they don’t have time” to work anymore.\nAfter the payment is done I’m working with the people and I’m teaching them the first part (content creation); then for the next part - another payment, another teaching session (social media marketing) and so on. \nThere are 4 parts. \nSo I’m not asking for a full upfront payment because I cannot provide any guarantee for what I’m speaking. \nOf course that I can provide screenshots from my Fanvue account or from my private messages with my team members.\n*Real guarantees, not screenshots with $ in my Fanvue account. - those are nonsense because can be manipulated.\n\nThe point is: I got tired of those gurus who are pretending to make hundreds of thousands of$ monthly and they are selling course for 50-100$, one time price, and scam naive people.\nThose courses don’t have any useful information, I know what I’m talking because I have in my team guys who bought some courses before from those gurus. \n\nSo your platform will be very useful!",

      "text": "Recently I’ve been noticing something crucial that I fear we’re starting to lose in this digital age. In person, we go to many businesses repeatedly because our “Guy” is there.\n\nThe reason why you may choose this franchised restaurant over its sister locations despite it being further.\n\nThe reason why you’ll sigh and pay extra when your barber’s price goes up, while others don’t.\n\nThe reason why you'll wait in line for your regular bartender is that the other bartenders may have shorter lines and be working from the same stock.\n\nIt’s almost irrational when it’s written down, it all stems from the same reasoning. You trust that your guy gets you and will never steer you wrong.\n\nBecause they’re your “Guy”.\n\nOne thing I see with clients a lot is that they don’t try to position themselves this way.\n\nThey focus on listing services, credentials, packages, or features, but they never answer an unspoken question customers actually care about: “Is this the person I want to keep coming back to?”\n\nBeing someone’s guy isn’t just about being the most pristine or posting nonstop. It’s about showing people that human aspect. That excellent customer service shows that you get them.\n\nWhen customers feel that, loyalty happens naturally. Referrals happen naturally. Price sensitivity drops without you ever having to force it.\n\nThey may even just offer you more money because they value… their “Guy”.\n\nIf you’re a business owner or service provider, I honestly think this is one of the most underrated levers there is.\n\nIt is simply just becoming the person people trust enough to stop looking elsewhere.\n\nBecome their “Guy”.\n\nCurious if others have noticed this too, either as a customer or as a business owner?",

Stuff like “no surprises on price” or “I’ll tell you if this isn’t right for you.”\n\n\n\nYou can even design this into the business: same point of contact, regular check‑ins, pattern‑spotting (“last time you liked X, so I thought of Y”), and a simple way to share wins with their team so they look good internally. That’s where tools like HubSpot, Notion, or even equity platforms like Cake Equity turn into quiet loyalty engines, because they help you consistently show up as the same reliable human every time.\n\n\n\nIf you build around being their person, not just their vendor, you stop competing on a feature list.",

Pick your state Most people should form in the state where they actually live or do business. Forming in Delaware/Wyoming only makes sense in specific situations, otherwise you may end up paying extra to register in your home state anyway.\n2. Choose an LLC name Check your state’s business name database to make sure it’s available and follows the naming rules (usually requires “LLC” or “L.L.C.”).\n3. Choose a registered agent This person/company receives legal and state mail for your LLC. In many states you can be your own registered agent if you have a reliable in-state address and can be available during business hours.\n4. File the Articles of Organization This is the official formation filing with your state. You’ll pay the state filing fee (varies by state).\n5. Create an Operating Agreement Even if your state doesn’t require it, you should have one. It helps show the LLC is separate from you, and it’s essential if you have multiple owners.\n6. Get an EIN from the IRS It’s free and you’ll usually need it to open a business bank account, handle taxes, and hire contractors.\n7. Open a business bank account and keep things separate Separate banking and clean bookkeeping matter if you want the liability protection to actually hold up.\n8. Stay compliant Annual reports, state fees, licenses (if needed), and any tax registrations your business requires.\n\nDo you need a lawyer?  \nUsually not for a simple single-member LLC. You might want one if you have partners, want custom ownership/profit splits, are raising money, or have higher liability.\n\nIf you want a step-by-step walkthrough, here’s a good starter guide: [How to Start an LLC](https://businessanywhere.io/business-registration/).",

Going to elaborate on the plan and challenge I foresee along the way. (Honestly the main challenge is the finance) Any insight/guidance/criticism on my thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTHE BUSINESS - fashion/clothing - specifically men's hybrid swimwear. Hybrid as in leisurely (for the beach/pool but also for casual nights out, family gatherings, etcs).\n\nTHE MARKET - Primarily Men - Age range 18-60 - economic class varies, but the products will be priced at a premium.\n\nTHE TIMELINE -\n\nYEAR 1-2 PLAN - Develop tech pack, conceptual designs, context of the brand to share with potential production partners. Identify partner. Lock in partner. Develop samples to perfection. Roll out designs afterwards and produce first batch - 400 items - 4 different designs - 33 size M, 34 size L and 33 size XL - for each design. Concurrently - build online presence - claim social media pages, business internet domain, develop eCommerce page (Shopify). Afterwards - get to sales/marketing - work with local photographers/videographers to produce content - post content on Instagram/TikTok/FB Advertisements. Attend local pop up shops. Goal =Make $15k in profit. If 400 items x $20/ea = $8,000 upfront cost. I would sell my shorts at a minimum $58. CHALLENGE: Im broke and do not have the $$ to cover the upfront cost (production development, advertising, marketing, subscription fees to eCommerce, etc). So during this time I'll also have to scrape funds to cover upfront cost without putting myself at risk of living on the streets.\n\nYEAR 3-4 - Reinvest some of the profits into the next product. Production Batch #2. This time we'll increase the MOQ to 600. Assuming tariffs and inflation, production per item would increase to $22. So the total would be $13,200. Hopefully by this time my brand has gotten better traction and I will increase my product to sell at $60. Retaining a $22,800 profit, I'd reinvest for batch production #4 by year 4. Ideally I'd roll out by top 10 designs, 100 items, 33 size M, 34 size L and 33 size XL for each design.\n\nYEAR 5 - Batch Production for rollout #5. Secure a warehouse. Develop a team for my brand - warehouse manager, marketing specialist, accountant, etc. I'll revisit Year 6-10 once I get through Year 1.",

To then when I have scraped together a decent amount of cash, buy from discounters real new pairs of shoes from example dior or balenciaga to keep flipping and go from there and keep like learning and seeing selling patterns to get better deals and bang for my buck.\n\nNow the only part I'm not 100% on board with is the reps part to kick start it all, but let me know what you guys think!

It is illegal in many places, gets people banned from payment platforms, and damages trust before you even start. It does not set you up for legit resale later. When you switch to real pairs, you are not leveling up your game, you are starting from zero with extra risk attached for nothing.\n\nThere is also no reason for a potential customer to buy from you instead of established platforms or reputable resellers. Sneakers are a commodity. Trust, authentication, buyer protections, and personal reputation matter more than anything, and you do not have an edge in any of those. Without a clear advantage in access, price, speed, or brand, you lose.. big time.\n\nSneaker resale is also extremely competitive and margins are thin. The people who make money have capital, bots, backdoor access, or strong relationships. Learning over time and **hoping** to get better deals is not a strategy, it is wishful thinking that will end up ruining you.",

The setup is basically a building with 4-6 theaters that would resemble what a wealthy person would have in their home. High end furniture, really nice projector/screen, etc. Charging $50/person for 4-12 seat theaters plus food and beverage. \n\nCurious if anyone has experience with something like this either from the customer perspective or business side. Any idea how much it costs a theatre to show first run movies?",

I’m planning to start small from home, focusing on handcrafted quality rather than mass production.\n\nTo manage startup costs, I’m considering sourcing packaging, molds, and basic equipment from Alibaba, while keeping ingredients fresh and locally sourced. Alongside this, I think building a strong online presence early will be key. My plan is to use Instagram, TikTok, and possibly a simple website to showcase the chocolate-making process, highlight the Dubai-inspired theme, take small orders, and test demand before scaling.\n\nInitially, I’d offer a limited range of products like bars, truffles, and filled chocolates, reinvesting profits as the brand grows.\n\nI’d love advice on whether the homemade chocolate market is too saturated and if Dubai-themed branding actually helps stand out.\n\n I’d also appreciate tips on setting up an online presence early and pricing a small but premium-style chocolate brand.",

          "text": "I was recently researching profitability of selling chocolates online (nothing really deep) and economics are very brutal. Of course it depends where you are and what are your shipping costs. Of course I was only looking at reselling existing one so making it yourself is potentially increasing your margins. \n\nHowever, again depending on your jurisdiction, food production is usually heavily regulated. You need to have separate place or at least separate room and you need to have your stuff checked. \n\nThen there is logistics. In hot climate chocolates can start to melt. \n\nSo in my humble opinion you would need to make a premium product and sell it with significant margin to make it work. \n\n> if Dubai-themed branding actually helps stand out.\n\nDefinitely not. There is dubai chocolate everything. I've seen ice tea, perfumes and even [shower gels](https://webshop.afroditacosmetics.com/int/dubai-chocolate-shower-gel). Whenever I see a \"dubai chocolate\" now I think stupid rip off.",

I have a background in quality assurance and improvement and would like to start this program as soon as I graduate. EMS in my area and as a whole is burning out medics through predatory QA departments and I have a program that teaches how to approach QA to improve providers not make them fear QA and leave the profession. This business would cover implementation of the new QA program, staff training, personal attendance to 3 QAQI meetings, data and analytics training. I would then be on a retainer for large sentinel events and other consulting needs. My research has shown this as a pretty untapped niche and pricing goals would be 20k for start up training and implementation followed by a 4k per month retainer that would scale up and down depending on department size and need. I believe this could easily hit 7 figures within two years. Any advice is appreciated thank you.",

Since I don't live in the US and don't know anyone in Wyoming, I need a physical address there to receive legal documents during business hours. \n\nMy parents offered their Florida address, but that would force me to register in a less tax-favorable state.

Offer value by booking x amount of patients with the free re activation campaign. Then from there we build our trust foundation and background with this data. \n\nOption B:  \nOffer a short (15-minute) discovery call to find their gaps and offer a free full strategy setup (creative, landing page, structure) while the practice pays only for ad spend, since businesses already know ads cost money.\n\nFor those who’ve built agencies or worked with local businesses:  \nWhich approach would you trust more as a business owner and why?\n\nGenuinely looking for feedback, not selling anything.",
