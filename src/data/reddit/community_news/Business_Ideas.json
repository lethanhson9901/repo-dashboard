      "text": "I analyze regulatory signals to track **\"Unfair Gaps\"** — specific operational points where businesses are legally or structurally forced to lose money. Most founders look for \"ideas\". I look for verified liabilities.\n\nHere are 3 validated gaps from today's analysis.\n\n**1. The \"Customs Bottleneck\" (International Trade)**\n\n* **Pain:** Lost operational capacity and throughput from manual HS classification holds.\n* **The Unfair Gap:** Opportunity cost equivalent to lost throughput. For large traders, misclassification-driven holds defer millions in goods from reaching markets, freezing capital on the water.\n* **Context:** Classification depends on a small pool of human experts. When they are unavailable or make an error, it triggers customs inspections that reduce the effective capacity of ports and transport assets.\n* **Opportunity:** Automated HS Classification API that interprets rulings and validates shipment manifests *before* they leave the warehouse.\n\n**2. The \"Rework Tax\" (Ambulance Services)**\n\n* **Pain:** Rework and rebilling costs due to incomplete claim data (missing modifiers/mileage).\n* **The Unfair Gap:** Rework costs $25–$50 per claim internally. For an agency with thousands of Medicare claims, this translates into six-figure annual losses in avoidable labor and delayed cash flow.\n* **Context:** Medicare manuals demand strict adherence to origin/destination modifiers and mileage lines. Field documentation is often inconsistent, and errors are currently caught only *after* the payer denies the claim.\n* **Opportunity:** A \"Pre-Submission Scrubber\" for CMS-1500 forms that validates specific ambulance modifiers against dispatch data.\n\n**3. The \"Recall Drag\" (Wholesale Alcohol)**\n\n* **Pain:** Delayed cash collection due to manual recall credits and reconciliations.\n* **The Unfair Gap:** Financing cost and working-capital drag equal to 1–3% of affected revenue annually. Wholesalers carry the cost of disputed balances while waiting for paper-based reconciliation.\n* **Context:** Recall data (lots, quantities) is trapped in spreadsheets and emails. Wholesalers must reconcile inventory across the three-tier chain (Supplier -> Wholesaler -> Retailer) before they can settle accounts, which takes weeks.\n* **Opportunity:** A centralized \"Recall Reconciliation Platform\" that automates credit issuance and regulatory reporting.\n\n**Summary** I have a database of 3,700+ of these. I plan to share the best ones here regularly. Let me know in the comments which industry you want me to scan next (Construction? Real Estate? Energy?).",

It benefits big developers to keep working capital as long as possible, and small developers outright need it in many cases. The long payment terms can create strain for small suppliers, but it doesn't negatively impact large suppliers enough for them to care as much. If small suppliers tried to change the status quo, large suppliers will get more business just for the longer payment terms (unless there is no large supplier for a product, which can happen but is niche).\n\nYou would have to convince developers/contractors to consciously make their cash flow worse (they won't unless forced to, and sometimes can't even with predictive modeling), which isn't a problem solved with SaaS. It's a banking/credit problem on the developer side and an inability to force (unless you're effectively the only option) problem on the supplier side.",

They turnover their entire store in 30 days. Given that most terms for buying product are net30, the companies that are selling Costco products to sell, are effectively financing them. \n\nCostco has a ridiculously low sku count so people generally have one choice, not two. They work with their partners to get some advantage for their members. If the price of cocoa goes up, they go to their mfg and allow them to raise the price to cover that increase. But when the cost of cocoa goes down, you better believe they are making sure the mfg is lowering the price again. It goes both ways. They are partners. \n\nWith the categories you are describing, you can’t get what has made Costco work. For virtually every category you mentioned, people want choice. And with choice, there’s no volume. Costco buys in palettes. Your categories are one off purchases with considerable time in between purchases. \n\nIf you are thinking partners like the Costco auto program, I don’t think the clientele you want are bargain shopping and looking for ways to save money on houses, cars, vacations. If you are talking about a concierge service that will navigate these things for people, I pretty sure it already exists. \n\nJust my $.02",

If I spend $2k/year I’m not dropping $1k (or $10k) on a membership.\n\nSecond you’re not going to do any better than Costco’s volume and subsequent wholesale purchase cost - they operate internationally and have a huge amount of leverage and operational efficiencies. So at absolute best you’d be trading 1:1 discounts on goods for the income you’re bringing in from memberships.\n\nThree because you’re not going to be able to get the wholesale pricing that Costco gets because you won’t be able to bring that purchase volume you’d immediately be at a disadvantage against Costco, Sam’s, and BJs.\n\nFour presumptively most people who are spending enough at Costco where dropping $10k up front would even remotely justify their purchasing would be smart enough to do the overall math and see you’re not beating Costco’s total price year over year whatsoever because it would be impossible to do so unless you have a near unlimited budget to start your chain with.\n\nMaybe you could do a premium club experience where they sell Balenciaga and 55 gallon drums of Caviar.\n\nPS Costco has a hand in a bunch of that anyway - for example, Costco sells everything from insurance to moving services to credit card processing to cars (you actually get a discount but whatever.)",

You’d can’t gut margins on products by charging a membership fee - anyone that isn’t a complete idiot would figure it out.\n\nThe reason Costco can do it is they have the buying power and operational efficiencies as such that they have already taken their wholesale costs down to the wire (most of the time) before a customer has ever paid their nominal membership fee.\n\nUnless you yourself are Costco you’d be getting terrible wholesale pricing first because your volume would be peanuts and then trying to justify the artificially low pricing you advertise by charging artificially high membership fees.\n\nYou’ll also note in the areas that you suggest that Costco already operates in they don’t even do those in-house - they negotiate a discount for members with outside companies due to the volume of customers they’re sending them. So their overhead in most cases is approximately nothing, it’s just a bonus stream of revenue leveraging their existing customer base.\n\nIf we were speaking in hypotheticals maybe but the whole purpose of Costco is to attract bargain hunters which if you're going upmarket is exactly the market least likely to find bargain hunting appealing.\n\nThat's my personal opinion anyway.\n\n It's kind of like asking why there isn't a high end Walmart. its a contradiction.\n\nAlso final point - Costco is built around consumables so there’s a constant need for the membership. How often does someone buy a house, a car, a motorcycle, go to college?\n\nNow that I think about it you’re kind of proposing an internalized AARP or AAA.",

That way you can test out video length, price points, etc. It sounds like you have a TON of expertise, and people pay for that.   \nAlternatively, write up articles on some of these topics and pitch them to major pubs like The Economist, Wired, etc. You can also sign up with [medium.com](http://medium.com) and submit to publications within the site. I think you'd find your audience there.   \nIf I were you I'd do all of the above!",

The gap between knowing you can execute and just waiting on timing or capital to line up can be brutal, especially with a family depending on you.\n\nWhat stood out to me is that you’ve clearly been in the trenches for a long time. Solo dev, design, marketing, running teams, enterprise clients… that’s not theory, that’s real experience. A lot of people in this space talk a big game but haven’t actually carried that load themselves.\n\nI’m in a bit of a similar headspace at the moment, just coming at it from a different angle, and I’d genuinely be keen to talk. I’m especially interested in how you’ve approached AI in a practical way, not hype stuff but what actually saves time or makes money, and how you’ve kept stacks lean when cash was tight. Also curious how you’ve found the shift from pure bootstrapping to dealing with investors, because that alone can mess with your head.\n\nIf you’re open to it, feel free to DM me. Even a short chat would be worthwhile and if there’s a way to make it mutually useful, whether that’s collaboration or paid work or just pressure testing ideas, even better. Worst case we trade war stories and vent about the ecosystem, which sometimes helps more than people admit.\n\nWishing you some momentum soon. Anyone who’s lasted 15+ years in this game clearly has something most people don’t.",

The product build is already underway with a CTO, and I’m now narrowing in on a number of strong candidates for a GTM / Ops co-founder role.\n\nI’ve spent the last 15 years working hands-on in property maintenance and residential environments in London. I’m building DIFM because this category is massive but structurally broken. Pricing is unclear, fulfilment is unreliable, and customers are left in the dark when something goes wrong. Most platforms fail not because of demand, but because the operating model collapses once real jobs start happening.\n\nWe’re now close to MVP and entering that pre-launch phase where a lot of important but unglamorous work needs doing. This is the kind of work that gives you a real understanding of how startups are actually built. Not theory, not courses, not buzzwords, but real execution and decision-making under constraints.\n\nI’m looking for one switched-on person who wants to work closely with me during this phase.\n\nTo be clear on expectations from the start: this is not a formal job posting and not a corporate role. The commitment is light, flexible, and fully async, designed around existing commitments. It is initially unpaid as we’re pre-revenue and bootstrapped. If it becomes genuinely valuable on both sides, there’s room to formalise things later, either as a paid role once revenue or funding exists, or through equity only if someone ends up taking real, ongoing ownership.\n\nI’m deliberately not listing a rigid set of tasks. Different people bring different strengths. Some are strong at research, some at outreach, some at organisation, some at spotting problems early. I’d rather understand what you’re capable of than force a title on it.\n\nThis probably isn’t a fit if you’re looking for something polished, guaranteed, or highly structured. It is a fit if you’re curious how real businesses are built from the inside and want exposure to actual decisions while something real is going live.\n\nIf this resonates, send me a DM with a short intro, what you’re currently doing, what you’re good at or interested in working on, and a LinkedIn profile or CV.\n\nNo formal process, just a straightforward conversation.\n\nRegardless of whether this is for you or not, wishing everyone a great year ahead!\n\nEddie",

      "text": "Recently I’ve been noticing something crucial that I fear we’re starting to lose in this digital age. In person, we go to many businesses repeatedly because our “Guy” is there.\n\nThe reason why you may choose this franchised restaurant over its sister locations despite it being further.\n\nThe reason why you’ll sigh and pay extra when your barber’s price goes up, while others don’t.\n\nThe reason why you'll wait in line for your regular bartender is that the other bartenders may have shorter lines and be working from the same stock.\n\nIt’s almost irrational when it’s written down, it all stems from the same reasoning. You trust that your guy gets you and will never steer you wrong.\n\nBecause they’re your “Guy”.\n\nOne thing I see with clients a lot is that they don’t try to position themselves this way.\n\nThey focus on listing services, credentials, packages, or features, but they never answer an unspoken question customers actually care about: “Is this the person I want to keep coming back to?”\n\nBeing someone’s guy isn’t just about being the most pristine or posting nonstop. It’s about showing people that human aspect. That excellent customer service shows that you get them.\n\nWhen customers feel that, loyalty happens naturally. Referrals happen naturally. Price sensitivity drops without you ever having to force it.\n\nThey may even just offer you more money because they value… their “Guy”.\n\nIf you’re a business owner or service provider, I honestly think this is one of the most underrated levers there is.\n\nIt is simply just becoming the person people trust enough to stop looking elsewhere.\n\nBecome their “Guy”.\n\nCurious if others have noticed this too, either as a customer or as a business owner?",

Stuff like “no surprises on price” or “I’ll tell you if this isn’t right for you.”\n\n\n\nYou can even design this into the business: same point of contact, regular check‑ins, pattern‑spotting (“last time you liked X, so I thought of Y”), and a simple way to share wins with their team so they look good internally. That’s where tools like HubSpot, Notion, or even equity platforms like Cake Equity turn into quiet loyalty engines, because they help you consistently show up as the same reliable human every time.\n\n\n\nIf you build around being their person, not just their vendor, you stop competing on a feature list.",

For eg. the first payment is an upfront payment, a small one, like 30-50€. I settled it because I don’t want to waste my time with people who wants to make 10k in the first week and then leave my team because “they don’t have time” to work anymore.\nAfter the payment is done I’m working with the people and I’m teaching them the first part (content creation); then for the next part - another payment, another teaching session (social media marketing) and so on. \nThere are 4 parts. \nSo I’m not asking for a full upfront payment because I cannot provide any guarantee for what I’m speaking. \nOf course that I can provide screenshots from my Fanvue account or from my private messages with my team members.\n*Real guarantees, not screenshots with $ in my Fanvue account. - those are nonsense because can be manipulated.\n\nThe point is: I got tired of those gurus who are pretending to make hundreds of thousands of$ monthly and they are selling course for 50-100$, one time price, and scam naive people.\nThose courses don’t have any useful information, I know what I’m talking because I have in my team guys who bought some courses before from those gurus. \n\nSo your platform will be very useful!",

      "text": "Need to find a good registered agent in New Mexico. What are my options?\n\nI'm a US citizen and digital nomad, been freelancing for 5 years now and currently based in Italy. I'm setting up the New Mexico LLC for my freelance business. I'm stuck on the registered agent requirement. Since I don't live in the US and don't know anyone in New Mexico, I need a physical address there to receive legal documents during business hours.\n\nMy parents offered their Florida address, but that would force me to register in a less tax-favorable state. It looks like most nomads use servicesfor about $125/year to handle digital forwarding. Is paying for a service truly the only way to do this legally, and how much mail will they actually be handling?",

For what it's worth, I ended up going with Northwest Registered Agent and have had a great experience so far. They scan all the legal and state mail into my account. I am actually about to upgrade to the premium mail package so I can just have all my mail sent there and uploaded to my account. They will actually even shred the junk mail, too. Super easy to work with, great support and they are all about privacy. \n\nDef give them a look. It's been well worth it for us and we are continuing to add other services of theirs as we grow.",

Everything I read says Delaware is the gold standard (Court of Chancery, VC friendly), but I’m getting wildly different advice on how to actually form the thing.\n\nMy cousin (who is a paralegal, not a corporate lawyer) is scaring me saying that if I don't have a lawyer draft the Operating Agreement, the online templates will leave me wide open for personal liability if I ever get sued. She mentioned something about piercing the corporate veil and how most of these online services don't actually handle the foreign qualification if I'm not living in DE (I’m based in Austin, TX).\n\nWhat's a cheap and fast way to form an LLC in Delaware for a project that's started generating some monthly income? I'm looking for legit options that won't hit me with unnecessary upsells or hourly charges. Any advice on how to handle this efficiently? I need a solution to complete the set up online. \n\nLawyer quoted me $2,500 for a \"startup package.\" This feels like a massive chunk of my bootstrap budget just for some paperwork.\n\nFor those who used an online service, did it ever come back to bite you when you tried to raise money or open a bank account? Has anyone actually had a \"standard\" Operating Agreement fail them in a legal dispute?  \n  \nI really don't want to spend $2k+ if I don't have to, but I also don't want to save $1,500 now only to lose the whole company later because of a typo in a template.  \n",

To then when I have scraped together a decent amount of cash, buy from discounters real new pairs of shoes from example dior or balenciaga to keep flipping and go from there and keep like learning and seeing selling patterns to get better deals and bang for my buck.\n\nNow the only part I'm not 100% on board with is the reps part to kick start it all, but let me know what you guys think!

It is illegal in many places, gets people banned from payment platforms, and damages trust before you even start. It does not set you up for legit resale later. When you switch to real pairs, you are not leveling up your game, you are starting from zero with extra risk attached for nothing.\n\nThere is also no reason for a potential customer to buy from you instead of established platforms or reputable resellers. Sneakers are a commodity. Trust, authentication, buyer protections, and personal reputation matter more than anything, and you do not have an edge in any of those. Without a clear advantage in access, price, speed, or brand, you lose.. big time.\n\nSneaker resale is also extremely competitive and margins are thin. The people who make money have capital, bots, backdoor access, or strong relationships. Learning over time and **hoping** to get better deals is not a strategy, it is wishful thinking that will end up ruining you.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI’m exploring the idea of starting a small homemade chocolate business and would really appreciate some feedback from this community.\n\nThe concept is inspired by the rising appeal of Dubai-style chocolates, known for rich flavors, premium presentation, and unique ingredients like pistachio, dates, saffron, cardamom, and filled chocolate bars with Middle Eastern twists. I’m planning to start small from home, focusing on handcrafted quality rather than mass production.\n\nTo manage startup costs, I’m considering sourcing packaging, molds, and basic equipment from Alibaba, while keeping ingredients fresh and locally sourced. Alongside this, I think building a strong online presence early will be key. My plan is to use Instagram, TikTok, and possibly a simple website to showcase the chocolate-making process, highlight the Dubai-inspired theme, take small orders, and test demand before scaling.\n\nInitially, I’d offer a limited range of products like bars, truffles, and filled chocolates, reinvesting profits as the brand grows.\n\nI’d love advice on whether the homemade chocolate market is too saturated and if Dubai-themed branding actually helps stand out.\n\n I’d also appreciate tips on setting up an online presence early and pricing a small but premium-style chocolate brand.",

Of course it depends where you are and what are your shipping costs. Of course I was only looking at reselling existing one so making it yourself is potentially increasing your margins. \n\nHowever, again depending on your jurisdiction, food production is usually heavily regulated. You need to have separate place or at least separate room and you need to have your stuff checked. \n\nThen there is logistics. In hot climate chocolates can start to melt. \n\nSo in my humble opinion you would need to make a premium product and sell it with significant margin to make it work. \n\n> if Dubai-themed branding actually helps stand out.\n\nDefinitely not. There is dubai chocolate everything. I've seen ice tea, perfumes and even [shower gels](https://webshop.afroditacosmetics.com/int/dubai-chocolate-shower-gel).

EMS in my area and as a whole is burning out medics through predatory QA departments and I have a program that teaches how to approach QA to improve providers not make them fear QA and leave the profession. This business would cover implementation of the new QA program, staff training, personal attendance to 3 QAQI meetings, data and analytics training. I would then be on a retainer for large sentinel events and other consulting needs. My research has shown this as a pretty untapped niche and pricing goals would be 20k for start up training and implementation followed by a 4k per month retainer that would scale up and down depending on department size and need.

Going to elaborate on the plan and challenge I foresee along the way. (Honestly the main challenge is the finance) Any insight/guidance/criticism on my thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTHE BUSINESS - fashion/clothing - specifically men's hybrid swimwear. Hybrid as in leisurely (for the beach/pool but also for casual nights out, family gatherings, etcs).\n\nTHE MARKET - Primarily Men - Age range 18-60 - economic class varies, but the products will be priced at a premium.\n\nTHE TIMELINE -\n\nYEAR 1-2 PLAN - Develop tech pack, conceptual designs, context of the brand to share with potential production partners. Identify partner. Lock in partner. Develop samples to perfection. Roll out designs afterwards and produce first batch - 400 items - 4 different designs - 33 size M, 34 size L and 33 size XL - for each design. Concurrently - build online presence - claim social media pages, business internet domain, develop eCommerce page (Shopify). Afterwards - get to sales/marketing - work with local photographers/videographers to produce content - post content on Instagram/TikTok/FB Advertisements. Attend local pop up shops. Goal =Make $15k in profit. If 400 items x $20/ea = $8,000 upfront cost. I would sell my shorts at a minimum $58. CHALLENGE: Im broke and do not have the $$ to cover the upfront cost (production development, advertising, marketing, subscription fees to eCommerce, etc). So during this time I'll also have to scrape funds to cover upfront cost without putting myself at risk of living on the streets.\n\nYEAR 3-4 - Reinvest some of the profits into the next product. Production Batch #2. This time we'll increase the MOQ to 600. Assuming tariffs and inflation, production per item would increase to $22. So the total would be $13,200. Hopefully by this time my brand has gotten better traction and I will increase my product to sell at $60. Retaining a $22,800 profit, I'd reinvest for batch production #4 by year 4. Ideally I'd roll out by top 10 designs, 100 items, 33 size M, 34 size L and 33 size XL for each design.\n\nYEAR 5 - Batch Production for rollout #5. Secure a warehouse. Develop a team for my brand - warehouse manager, marketing specialist, accountant, etc. I'll revisit Year 6-10 once I get through Year 1.",

The key is getting your first few clients quickly so you can prove yourself and build word-of-mouth. Start with neighbors, friends, and family; even one satisfied client can lead to multiple referrals. Flyers can work, but personal outreach and local Facebook groups or Nextdoor are usually more effective and free. You can also think about small complementary services: driveway salting, sidewalk clearing, or even lawn care in warmer months. That way, your business isn’t entirely seasonal. Pricing is usually per driveway or per hour don’t undersell yourself, especially if you do a great job.

It often takes a long period of time to establish a customer base, a brand, systems, processes and in turn profit. Doing gig's on the other hand with like task rabbit etc is a way to almost bring in immediate income due to having a potential customer base there. Over the long term, you will take less though and don't essentially have a business, just an income which can be fine too. \n\nHowever, if building a business is more important, then you can absolutely start small and build something meaningful. Your capital is minimal, but so many service based businesses can be started with little capital, and lots of sweat equity. Like you mentioned, snow shovelling etc could work, it's seasonal however so finding services that align with this, but serve during the warmer months would be ideal. \n\nI would take a minute to write some things down that may interest you and look for ways that you could pursue that. You don't have to have a passion for what you do or love it, just a curiosity can often be enough. It could be pet grooming, dog walking, lawn care, personal training, aquarium tank cleaning, residential/ office cleaning, junk removal, meal prep....the list goes on. \n\nYou want to find a service that could be naturally recurring i.e. weekly cleaning, monthly car detailing etc.",

Offer value by booking x amount of patients with the free re activation campaign. Then from there we build our trust foundation and background with this data. \n\nOption B:  \nOffer a short (15-minute) discovery call to find their gaps and offer a free full strategy setup (creative, landing page, structure) while the practice pays only for ad spend, since businesses already know ads cost money.\n\nFor those who’ve built agencies or worked with local businesses:  \nWhich approach would you trust more as a business owner and why?\n\nGenuinely looking for feedback, not selling anything.",

      "text": "i’m a university student and i have recently joined the snowboard world. I instantly got interested in equipment etc, after renting for a while i decided i could buy my own, and going to a local shop i saw famous brand products with prices too high for me(for example 300$ board, 300$ boots and 300$ bindings were the beginner stuff). i then reached out to various chinese factories and found a good one to get a kit for myself, costed 300$ total. They also mass produce for big buyers, this made me think i could create my own brand, importing stuff and offering it to my local shops for a price that would be convenient even for them, but then discovered the tricky and obvious part, investing. how in the world i would be able to start something like this with not a lot of money if i have to order at least 20 boards of the same size just to have them customised, i’d need an assortment, but that is not possible. so i’m stuck here with this idea, no business experience but a lot of will. any suggestions",

Safety and quality equipment is paramount, you can’t just resell Alibaba boards and compete, you’ll also end up with a lawsuit on your hands when someone’s shitty board fails. I recommend trying to find a job in the industry, learn all you can, then set off on your own. Biggest margins with least liability are goggles.",

Consider accessories and add-ons like custom bindings, protective gear, travel covers, tuning kits, or eco-friendly wax. Localised designs, rentals, or repair services near resorts can also work well. Validate demand with small batches or pre-orders before investing heavily.",

People can get SERIOUSLY HURT and we have fatalities every year. \n\nI hate hearing the helicopter. That means massive trauma. \n\nInjured people sue everyone all mad. Gwyneth Paltrow got tangled up in lawsuits in our area. \n\nThe Chinese knock off everything and your Walmart type family will buy a cheap board from Chinese. Amazon is a wasteland.\n\nThe most disgusting thing is LLCS they register here. \n\nA guy overseas can sell on USA websites and have them shipped from a warehouse. He undercut everyone and is happy to make $2 or $3\n\nIt is creating a disaster for Amazon sellers. They are competing with a business being ran from India who dropships from a warehouse in the USA.  REALLY SAD",
