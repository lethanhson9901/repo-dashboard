          "text": "You are missing a key part of Costco’s model: \nThey turnover product in under 30 days. Sometimes twice in 30 days depending on the product. They turnover their entire store in 30 days. Given that most terms for buying product are net30, the companies that are selling Costco products to sell, are effectively financing them. \n\nCostco has a ridiculously low sku count so people generally have one choice, not two. They work with their partners to get some advantage for their members. If the price of cocoa goes up, they go to their mfg and allow them to raise the price to cover that increase. But when the cost of cocoa goes down, you better believe they are making sure the mfg is lowering the price again. It goes both ways. They are partners. \n\nWith the categories you are describing, you can’t get what has made Costco work. For virtually every category you mentioned, people want choice. And with choice, there’s no volume. Costco buys in palettes. Your categories are one off purchases with considerable time in between purchases. \n\nIf you are thinking partners like the Costco auto program, I don’t think the clientele you want are bargain shopping and looking for ways to save money on houses, cars, vacations. If you are talking about a concierge service that will navigate these things for people, I pretty sure it already exists. \n\nJust my $.02",

      "text": "I used to believe the hardest part of building a startup was coming up with a completely original idea. Every new concept felt exciting at first, but most of them fell apart once I tried to imagine real customers paying for them.\n\nRecently, while browsing StartupIdeas DB (i came across it on google) I noticed something interesting. Many of the most compelling businesses weren’t novel at all. They were existing ideas executed better, adapted to a new niche, or brought to a different market. In hindsight, this pattern shows up everywhere once you start looking for it.\n\nCopying gets a bad reputation, but most successful startups are really just proven businesses with a twist. Sometimes the twist is better UX, sometimes pricing, sometimes distribution, and sometimes geography. Very few are truly “from scratch” innovations.\n\nBuilding something completely new often means educating customers, validating demand the hard way, and making expensive mistakes no one else has made yet. Copying a business that already works shifts the challenge from “will this idea work?” to “can I execute better or differently?”, which feels like a much more solvable problem.\n\nI’m curious how others here think about this. Have you had more success innovating versus adapting? Where do you draw the line between copying and learning? And do you have examples of unoriginal ideas that worked surprisingly well for you?",

I was in your shoes recently, trying to figure out the simplest way to get an LLC going without breaking the bank or getting buried in paperwork.\n\nAt first, I was considering DIY since it seemed like the cheapest option. But after digging into it a bit more, I realized there’s a lot of small details that can trip you up, like making sure your registered agent is in place and understanding all the filing steps in your state. That’s when I decided to look into a service, and honestly, I’m glad I did.\n\nI ended up using BusinessAnywhere to help me with the process. They helped me choose the right state (I ended up going with Texas), and they handled everything from setting up the registered agent to filing the necessary paperwork. It was surprisingly affordable, and they took care of the stuff I was stressing over. For me, the time I saved was worth the small extra cost.\n\nSo yeah, if you’re looking to just get it done without diving deep into the weeds of LLC formation, I’d recommend a service like that. It might cost a bit upfront, but it’s way less of a headache, and you can focus on getting your business rolling.\n\nGood luck with it, and hope this helps!",

Everything I read says Delaware is the gold standard (Court of Chancery, VC friendly), but I’m getting wildly different advice on how to actually form the thing.\n\nMy cousin (who is a paralegal, not a corporate lawyer) is scaring me saying that if I don't have a lawyer draft the Operating Agreement, the online templates will leave me wide open for personal liability if I ever get sued. She mentioned something about piercing the corporate veil and how most of these online services don't actually handle the foreign qualification if I'm not living in DE (I’m based in Austin, TX).\n\nWhat's a cheap and fast way to form an LLC in Delaware for a project that's started generating some monthly income? I'm looking for legit options that won't hit me with unnecessary upsells or hourly charges. Any advice on how to handle this efficiently? I need a solution to complete the set up online. \n\nLawyer quoted me $2,500 for a \"startup package.\" This feels like a massive chunk of my bootstrap budget just for some paperwork.\n\nFor those who used an online service, did it ever come back to bite you when you tried to raise money or open a bank account? Has anyone actually had a \"standard\" Operating Agreement fail them in a legal dispute?  \n  \nI really don't want to spend $2k+ if I don't have to, but I also don't want to save $1,500 now only to lose the whole company later because of a typo in a template.  \n",

Delaware vs Texas Delaware only really matters early if you are actively planning a VC-style raise soon. If you are just selling and staying lean, a Texas LLC is often simpler and cheaper. If you form in Delaware but actually operate from Texas, you will likely still need to register as a foreign LLC in Texas and keep up with both states’ compliance.\n2. Operating Agreement and “piercing the veil” A template Operating Agreement is not what usually makes or breaks liability protection. Veil piercing is more about behavior: commingling funds, no separate bank account, sloppy bookkeeping, signing contracts personally, undercapitalization, ignoring formalities. A solid but standard OA plus clean ops typically gets you most of the benefit.\n3. Bank account and fundraising Banks mainly care about formation docs, EIN, and who controls the company. Investors care more about clean cap table, IP assignment, and the ability to convert to a Delaware C-corp later if needed.\n\nCheap and fast setup: file the Delaware certificate, get EIN, open a business bank account, adopt a basic OA, then do Texas foreign registration if you stick with Delaware. BusinessAnywhere can handle the filings/admin side if you want it streamlined without law firm rates. For anything complex (multiple owners, investors, unusual profit splits), that is when paying a real lawyer is worth it.",

I'm trying to decide if I should just list myself as the Registered Agent or if I should actually pay for a service.\n\nI really want to list myself as the RA since I meet all the requirements and I need this business address listed somewhere officially connecting it to my business. I'm asking this question because it's a dilemma because of something that happened with a friend and need more people's advice on what to do.   \n  \nSo this friend of mine started a small consulting gig last year and decided to be his own agent to save money. Long story short, he went on a much-needed camping trip for a week where he had zero cell service. That was the exact window when a legal notice regarding a minor contract dispute was delivered to his house. Because he wasn't there to sign for it and accept service, things got messy with the court dates, and he ended up paying way more in legal fees to fix the default than he ever would have spent on a registered agent.\n\nI get that this should convince me to get a registered agent service and I shouldn't be asking over here, but is does this happen frequently or my guy got extra unlucky?\n\nAnd also, what's everyone seeing for pricing? Most of the sites I’ve looked at seem to be in the $100 to $300 per year range, but I’ve seen some introductory offers for $50 that jump up later. Are there any hidden fees I should watch out for?",

Only issue I can think of is that I am not sure how fast I could get someone there money as I would probably need to have the item in hand before money can be transfered to prevent getting scammed.\n\nAgain this is just a random idea I just thought up while trying to fall asleep so its probably crap but I figured why not post about it here and see what people say about it.

You can still form an NM LLC and list a different mailing address, as long as the registered agent address is in New Mexico.\n\nHow much mail do they actually handle? Usually not much. Most freelancers will only see occasional state notices and, in the rare case something goes sideways, service of process. The main value is that someone is always there to receive time-sensitive documents and get them to you quickly.\n\nIf you want a simple option that’s built for remote founders, [BusinessAnywhere Registered Agent](https://businessanywhere.io/registered-agent-service/) covers the NM registered agent requirement and forwards notices digitally.",

I'm their business manager here in the States, and I don't have prior experience with non-US citizen registering an LLC.   \n  \nMy client is currently living in Europe and looking to set up an LLC for a consulting business. I've been  doing a deep dive into the best states for non-US citizens and honestly, the more I read, the more I get confused.\n\nThe business customers/clients are mostly in the US and UK, and we don't plan on having a physical office or employees in the States. So we're mainly looking for low annual maintenance fees and ease of opening a bank account (Mercury/Relay) as a non-resident.\n\nAnother non-US person I know actually tried to DIY their LLC formation last year in Florida because they liked the vibe of the state. Long story short, she ended up with a massive headache regarding the Registered Agent requirement and some unexpected state filings that she didn't realize were mandatory. She almost got her non-US citizen LLC entity dissolved because she missed a notice that was sent to a physical address she didn't have access to. I don't know why she used that address in the first place.\n\nWyoming seems to be the \"budget-friendly\" darling with great privacy. New Mexico keeps popping up for being super cheap, but I don't hear much about it from actual founders.\n\nDo we have to worry about running into any weird tax issues (Form 5472/1120) that can get harder because of the state we choose?\n\nThank you for reading this long-ass post.",

EMS in my area and as a whole is burning out medics through predatory QA departments and I have a program that teaches how to approach QA to improve providers not make them fear QA and leave the profession. This business would cover implementation of the new QA program, staff training, personal attendance to 3 QAQI meetings, data and analytics training. I would then be on a retainer for large sentinel events and other consulting needs. My research has shown this as a pretty untapped niche and pricing goals would be 20k for start up training and implementation followed by a 4k per month retainer that would scale up and down depending on department size and need. I believe this could easily hit 7 figures within two years. Any advice is appreciated thank you.",

It's a tool designed to provide people with the means of dealing with whatever mental struggles they're experiencing in a private and safe way. The tool is called Haven.\n\nHaven is an AI desktop companion that uses the Ollama LLM model to remain private and localized in your computer. It is completely local and offline. There are no external API's or services that are connected to the internet. It's essentially a chat box that is completely black boxed. Haven will respond to your texts in real time and remember several contextual information you provide it but will forget everything as soon as you close it. It's also designed to begin forgetting the conversation as the conversation continues.\n\nIn short, nothing you write ever leaves your computer. It's simply just you, your thoughts, and Haven. There's no way for me to even see how Haven is being used except through a feedback box that is embedded in the Haven application. Again, Haven is completely free and I intend to keep it free forever. If you're curious and want to use Haven, you can download it from my website here: [https://prometheussys.com](https://prometheussys.com/)\n\nIf you do end up installing it, I would very much appreciate if you can provide me with feedback on Haven. The goal is to improve this companion so that it can better address people's mental health struggles. It is also important to note that Haven was never designed to replace an actual professional but to be a tool in a person's toolbox when it comes to dealing with mental health struggles.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and thank you in advance for considering Haven.",

I have designed a mechanism that can be installed on a generator and is able to rotate any generator and generate electricity without using any fossil fuel, and without the need for any battery, solar, wind, or nuclear energy. It can be done on household, industrial, and power plant scales. In addition, if this mechanism is installed on vehicles, including cars, ships, airplanes, helicopters, and trains, it can move or fly them in two ways without consuming fuel. The first method: \"By directly using the alternating rotation of this innovative mechanism itself. In such a way that the powerful rotation of this device is transferred directly to the differential of the car or the propeller of the airplane and helicopter and the propeller of the ship and boat. In this method, they no longer need any engines.\" The second method: \"The alternating rotation of this innovative device can be transferred to the generator and get electricity from it and transfer the free electricity generated to a strong electromotor and from the rotation of the electromotor, all  \"It moved cars, ships, airplanes, etc.\" The advantage of this invention, in addition to not consuming fuel, is the removal of all internal combustion engines, including cylinders, pistons, connecting rods, crankshafts, radiators, etc. from their bodies. So the features of this invention are: 1_ Fuel-free consumption 2_ Elimination of the internal combustion engine (removal of cylinders, pistons, connecting rods, crankshafts, valves, radiators, etc. and any consumable and wear parts) 3_ No noise, atmospheric, or greenhouse emissions 4_ A tremendous reduction in the cost of building and producing power plants, airplanes, ships, automobiles, etc. due to the elimination of the engine 5_ Acceleration, power, and speed that are mind-boggling compared to internal combustion engines",

The key is getting your first few clients quickly so you can prove yourself and build word-of-mouth. Start with neighbors, friends, and family; even one satisfied client can lead to multiple referrals. Flyers can work, but personal outreach and local Facebook groups or Nextdoor are usually more effective and free. You can also think about small complementary services: driveway salting, sidewalk clearing, or even lawn care in warmer months. That way, your business isn’t entirely seasonal. Pricing is usually per driveway or per hour don’t undersell yourself, especially if you do a great job.

It often takes a long period of time to establish a customer base, a brand, systems, processes and in turn profit. Doing gig's on the other hand with like task rabbit etc is a way to almost bring in immediate income due to having a potential customer base there. Over the long term, you will take less though and don't essentially have a business, just an income which can be fine too. \n\nHowever, if building a business is more important, then you can absolutely start small and build something meaningful. Your capital is minimal, but so many service based businesses can be started with little capital, and lots of sweat equity. Like you mentioned, snow shovelling etc could work, it's seasonal however so finding services that align with this, but serve during the warmer months would be ideal. \n\nI would take a minute to write some things down that may interest you and look for ways that you could pursue that. You don't have to have a passion for what you do or love it, just a curiosity can often be enough. It could be pet grooming, dog walking, lawn care, personal training, aquarium tank cleaning, residential/ office cleaning, junk removal, meal prep....the list goes on. \n\nYou want to find a service that could be naturally recurring i.e. weekly cleaning, monthly car detailing etc.",

I like the idea of building something for myself, making my own decisions, and not always feeling like I’m working on someone else’s dream.\n\nAt the same time, I keep getting stuck in my own head. I have doubts about doing it alone. Not about the work itself, but about trusting myself enough to make the right calls, handle setbacks, and not freeze when things get hard. Some days I feel confident and motivated, other days I’m questioning if I’m even cut out for it or if I’m just romanticizing the idea.\n\nWhat messes with me is that I don’t know if this lack of confidence is just a normal part of the process or a sign that I’m not ready yet. I keep wondering if confidence is something you’re supposed to already have before starting, or if it’s something that only shows up once you’re actually in it.\n\nI guess I’m curious if anyone else has felt this way before starting their own thing. Did you push through the doubt, wait until you felt “ready,” or realize you needed a partner or some kind of safety net? Just trying to figure out if this feeling is part of the journey or something I should take seriously.",

Lack of confidence is very common (I wonder if the algo directed me to your post).  \n\nSome people suggest what you are feeling is due to \"limiting beliefs\" caused by some trauma or how you grew up.  While some of that may certainly exist for some people (not a psychologist), I think it comes down to lack of experience.  \n\nThose of us with experience are more willing to jump and take the risk because we have the confidence to figure things out as we go — even though we know we could still fail.\n\nNormally, you gain confidence through life experience and through practice. I like to say that practice builds confidence and confidence builds skills — and skills pay the bills.  \n\nWatching a bunch of videos on how to do business is not practice.  Buying a course that describes a business recipe is not practice.  \n\nSo when you start taking steps to start your business, you realize you are not sure what to do next — that's the lack of confidence due to lack of practice or experience.\n\nIMO the fastest way to gain this confidence is through simulated experience — ie, play business simulation games. Just like a pilot learns to fly an airplane with a flight simulator, it's possible to do the same with business.",

If someone asks how many invoices a company processes per day, month, or year, you should be able to give a solid ballpark answer immediately.\n\nLook for inefficiencies, identify financial leaks, and build your network. I would stay at your current company and study it from the inside out. Create spreadsheets and diagrams outlining the employee structure, salaries, job titles, and deliverables. Build a customer contact network. Spend extra times cross-training, become exceptional at your role, and help others succeed in theirs. Be approachable and professional.\n\nAfter a year or two, you’ll likely move up in the company. By then, you’ll be a subject-matter expert with a clear understanding of where money is wasted, where costs can be reduced, and which processes can be improved. You’ll also have built the relationships needed to eventually start your own medical billing company. Read *How to Become a CEO* by Jeffrey J. Fox.\n\nOnce you’ve effectively reverse engineered your current company, you can approach investors and clearly demonstrate how your ideas improve on an existing model. If someone came to me having done this work, I would invest. If there’s no non compete in place, you may also be able to bring customers and strong employees with you.\n\nGo to work every day with the mindset that you are an undercover CEO. Do your job better than anyone else and never stop learning. This is why so many mailroom employees eventually became CEOs: they understood the business from the ground up.",

                  "text": "Sure, happy to share some thoughts. I spent about five years doing emergency medicine in the military as a Navy corpsman/EMT. That included mass-casualty drills, CBRN/CMRNE training, and acting as a medical subject-matter expert during war-game exercises, especially around MEDEVAC workflows. What you’re describing resonates a lot. Punitive QA/QI cultures tend to reduce learning instead of improving outcomes.\n\nA few suggestions that might help as you prepare to launch:\n\n**1. Build and map your network intentionally**  \nAre you collaborating with anyone yet? Network matters a lot in this space. I’d start by making two simple lists:  \n- Everyone you personally know in EMS, education, administration, or adjacent healthcare roles (professors, former supervisors, QA managers, hospital partners, etc.)  \n- A broader market map. Create a spreadsheet organized by state listing EMS agencies, EMT and paramedic programs, community colleges, universities, and large private providers\n\n**2. Study the competitive landscape**  \nLook closely at what’s already being offered. Pay attention to framing, pricing models, and especially what is *not* being addressed well. If you still have university access, use healthcare and industry databases (check out Dun & Bradstreet Million dollar database)  . There’s valuable market data there that most people never bother to look up.\n\n**3. Lead with a value-added free tool**  \nBefore selling anything, consider creating something genuinely useful that QA/QI staff and educators would bookmark and share. For example:  \n- A QA/QI workflow checklist or decision tree  \n- A non-punitive case review framework  \n- A simple web tool that aggregates standards, reporting templates, or triage references  \n\nBrand it lightly and require an email to access it. This builds trust and gives you a warm contact list made up of exactly the people you want to talk to.\n\nFrom there, outreach becomes natural. Introduce yourself, share the free resource, then offer your training or retainer services as an optional next step. Visual clarity also matters. Clean diagrams, short explainer videos, and frictionless payment options go a long way in healthcare administration.\n\nOverall, I think you’re right that there’s a real market for this, especially if QA/QI is framed as a learning and safety system rather than enforcement. Happy to bounce around ideas if you want to dig deeper.\n\nAlso, be the most expensive in your field, use the excess funds to improve the community you’re working in.",

LinkedIn and job boards charge heavily just to post roles or reach candidates, and even after paying, companies often still don’t get suitable applicants.\n\nSo my question is: would you actually use something like this?  \nAnd what would matter most for you to try a new platform instead of sticking with LinkedIn?\n\nThanks in advance, any thoughts are appreciated.",

They also mass produce for big buyers, this made me think i could create my own brand, importing stuff and offering it to my local shops for a price that would be convenient even for them, but then discovered the tricky and obvious part, investing. how in the world i would be able to start something like this with not a lot of money if i have to order at least 20 boards of the same size just to have them customised, i’d need an assortment, but that is not possible. so i’m stuck here with this idea, no business experience but a lot of will. any suggestions",
