      "text": "Most people come up with a business idea based on the model first. They spend weeks building the thing before figuring out if there’s any real demand for it. We should flip it.\n\nThe most successful businesses are engineered from the outside in. You find the distribution channel or the marketing funnel first, and then you build a business around that. You look for a high-intent dataset, identify the solution, and then go build your product/service.   \n  \nThere are free datasets all over the place that are completely overlooked. If you can find the data, you can find the business. My framework is scrape, enrich, sell, build. \n\nOne of the best datasets is the **Secretary of State’s new business registrations**. Every week, new LLCs and corporations are registered. There are a bunch of different ways you can slice this but I’d start with brick-and-mortar business registrations. This is the scraping phase.\n\nI’ve sat on the other side of this. I worked for a retailer building out new store opening plans, and the vendor list was a critical piece that had to be finalized before the doors opened.\n\nOnce the location is ready, the manager or corporate coordinator is looking to line up the vendors that they’re gonna work with. It’s all proactive. It’s a great time to strike when there’s interest there.\n\nOne of the vendors that would need to be lined up was a floor cleaning company. If the location had carpet, we did a monthly shampoo. If it had hard floors, it was a quarterly cleaning and an annual strip and wax. \n\nWhen you have the list of these businesses, you need to enrich the dataset. The goal is to try and figure out their opening timeline and who the decision maker is. Facebook, Instagram, their website are all great to find that opening timeline. LinkedIn is unmatched for finding the decision maker.\n\nYou’ve found the decision maker and you know the timeline so now you need to sell. Cold email and LinkedIn DMs get crowded. They still work but try to get creative. Send a welcome basket to their office with a brochure on who you are. I can tell you that we never got those from any vendors. And if we did, they absolutely would’ve been on my list to call. Be different and show care.\n\nOnce you’ve sold, you can really start to build this into a real scalable opportunity. Most companies won’t ask for any sort of references or anything. You’ll definitely need a Certificate of Insurance and LLC to prove that you’re legit.   \n  \nIn the example of floor cleaning, it was around $1k every quarter and then $1,500 for the strip and wax. We were in different markets and had to find a new vendor in each one. So on average, they were making between $5-7k from us every year.   \n  \nIt doesn’t have to be floor cleaning but it’s a legit example of what you can do by finding this dataset that a lot of people overlook. Go find the distribution and build the business afterward.\n\n",

Its what happens when you want to bring a younger guys and you wanna push out the old dude. But he’s not one to let it get him down. He knows the industry really well. Tons of accolades from his former company. Recently been watching a YouTube channel called delivered. The guy live streams his car negotiations they do on behalf of customers. The basic concept of his businesses, customers pay him a flat fee to find and negotiate a car that they want on their behalf. I think my dad could essentially take that same concept and apply it to semi trucks. Basically as a consult. You could help guys or small Long just companies that need trucks to make sure that they’re not getting ripped off. We can take out the stress part of negotiating.",

The barrier of entry is so low, which means insane competition.\n\nBut on the other side of this, there’s now insane demand for monetization experts who know how to turn views into money without leaving a lot on the table.\n\nIn my opinion, learning to build funnels puts you in a golden spot in this influencer era. Finding clients is easy. I’ve had to raise my prices to the point where I won’t even consider anything under $10k/month base fee + commission.\n\nAnd you don’t have to work only with influencers. I built a funnel for a California construction company that sells Chinese backyard rental houses (unit price ~$300k), and now they’re selling around 5 units per month. My 5% commission on that is not bad.\n\nI guess ask me anything. Just wanted to throw this idea out here for those still starting out and standing at a road fork of choosing a business model.",

The real leverage is knowing how to grab a stranger from a 15-second clip and walk them through 3–5 clear steps to a purchase without feeling like a scammy bro. The cool thing is that once you’ve built 2–3 solid funnels in different verticals, you start seeing patterns you can charge serious retainers for, just like your construction example.\n\nIf you want to push this further, I’d systemize: one core discovery doc, one funnel blueprint, one reporting template, and one “offer fix” process you run every client through. Tools like HighLevel or HubSpot for the plumbing, ConvertKit or Klaviyo for nurture, and something like Pulse for Reddit to spot real buyer questions and objections in the wild so you can wire that language straight into the funnel. Main point: mastering funnels is a quieter path, but the upside is often bigger and more defensible than being the face on camera.",

The hard part is understanding demand, objections, pricing power, and where the funnel should stay simple instead of clever. That is where introverts tend to do well because it rewards thinking and iteration over constant posting. The risk I see is selling funnels as a commodity instead of positioning around outcomes and constraints.

After that's done I try to identify bottlenecks and which one has the highest ROI to start working on. And then as a numbers guy, my favorite part: doing split tests. Like conversion rate of landing page A vs landing page B, or open rate of email subject like A vs subject line B.\n\nI'm using GoHighLevel CRM for literally everything. I've found an all-in-one tool like HighLevel have more net benefits on my business growth than trying to duct tape Wordpress + some forms plugin + Zapier and whatever together.\n\nI've tried quite every outreach method, cold emailing, messenger and IG outreach, even had my friend do cold calling instead of me :) But the first clients came from cold email and cold call. Then referals started coming unexpectedly fast, even if you have bad results, if you can keep good friendly relations with the client, then you can ask them to refer you to their other biz owner friends. \n\nMy first offer for a dentist client was \"I get you 10 new patients in the first month, or you don't have to pay\". I don't remember how many patients we got her but generated like $120,000 in revenue, so exceeded the expectations by a lot\n\nAre you also running an online business? You sound like you know a lot",

We should be so lucky - the hardest part is over (realizing you don’t want a 9-5 and getting started aka posting here for advice).\n\nStarting a business is relatively easy, but extremely complex. At the end of the day, applying a reductionist view, someone out there will need to swipe a credit card for something you made/did or will make/do. \n\nWhat’s a common problem you see in your industry? Whats a company that already exists that you can copy/tweak their offering? Products or Services? Bits or Atoms? These are just some questions to get the mind moving in the right direction.\n\nMost businesses just become jobs with extra steps, or a lifestyle. And that’s okay! Because YOU are in control. YOU are the captain now. But, like everything else in life, that is a trade off.\n\nFigure out:\n- What you can offer (what skills do you have? what insight makes you unique?)\n- Who’s gonna buy it (who needs this thing you’re offering?)\n- How are you going to reach them (phone? snail mail? cold email? LinkedIn?)\n- How are they gonna buy it (credit card? recurring? one off? platforms? (Etsy, Gumroad, etc.))\n- How can you make this p/s flywheel more efficient?\n\nOnce you answer all of the above, you can start testing & iterating. From there you are off to the races! Happy to help, just lmk. ",

      "text": "So I’ve been thinking about a small business idea. Pretty simple, lowkey easy to do. Basically a subscription where people get an envelope in the mail every week (or once a month bundled) with motivational quotes, challenges, maybe stickers, patches, or little things like that to start your week. Something to help you build habits, track progress, and just push yourself.\n\nI’m thinking $4.99/month to start. Affordable, easy to try. Subscribers could post themselves doing the challenges on IG, and I’d repost to make a community vibe. Could even do small monthly giveaways or bonus items to keep people hyped.\n\nI’ve thought about having different “categories” like gym, running, military, new moms/dads, sports, etc., but probably just start with one and scale. Down the line I could even make an app to track challenges, streaks, and connect people digitally.\n\nI looked at similar stuff — mindfulness mail clubs, art mail clubs, that kind of thing — most of them are $5–$12/month for letters + stickers, $30–$40 for bigger boxes. Makes $4.99 competitive, and the weekly challenge + progress angle seems different.\n\nStartup cost is low too. Printing, envelopes, stickers, postage, maybe some design stuff. I’m thinking $100–$250 for the first 25–50 people to test it.\n\nSo basically: physical motivational content + small surprise item + community/accountability + maybe giveaways. Simple, cheap, recurring revenue, scalable if people like it.\n\nWould people actually pay for something like this? Feedback, ideas, or ways to make it better would be dope.",

Quotes are abundant and free, so the real value has to be the mechanism that gets someone to actually do the thing week after week.\n\nA few things to pressure test early. At $4.99, physical fulfillment will eat margin fast, especially with postage and churn. That price point usually only works if retention is strong or if it leads into a higher value offer later. Also, “everyone” is too broad. One very specific group with a clear pain point will convert much better than generic motivation.\n\nIf I were testing this, I’d validate one niche, one challenge format, and one outcome. No app, no categories, no giveaways at first. Just answer: do people open it, do they act on it, and do they still want it next month.

If you market to SMBs: would you pay for this? What price range feels realistic?\n   2. What’s the #1 reason you *wouldn’t* buy an AI chatbot from a small operator?\n   3. What niche has the clearest ROI (dental, HVAC, legal, real estate, etc.)?\n   4. White-label vs custom built within replit: which is more appealing and why?",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m a business analytics postgrad in the UK and honestly... the entry-level analytics market right now is rough.  \nSeeing people with 3–4 years of experience applying for “junior” roles made me rethink the whole apply endlessly and wait approach.\n\nOver the last year, through internships and project work, one thing became very clear to me:  \nmost small businesses don’t need “analytics”..... they need clearer answers to very basic business questions.\n\nSo I’m thinking of building a very small, agency...focused on helping small businesses answer things like:\n\n1. Which products actually make money vs just take up space?\n2. Where is cash or effort leaking day to day?\n3. What should the owner focus on this month vs ignore for now?\n\nNot dashboards for the sake of it.... just clarity.\n\nWhat I’m actually talking about is as following....\n\nFor example, in a recent retail-style setup I worked on, the focus was simply:\n\n1. organising daily sales and stock data in one place (Excel / Sheets)\n2. identifying top-selling vs slow-moving items\n3. linking staff shifts to busy vs quiet periods\n4. ending with a 1-page action plan: what to stock less, what to push more, and what to stop doing\n5. No fancy software. No heavy tools. Just decisions made easier.\n\nHow I’m thinking of working (at least initially)\n\nunderstand how you currently track sales, inventory, staff, costs\n\nI go away, analyse, and come back with:\n\n2–3 clear insights\n\n2–3 concrete actions\n\ndone for free at first, to build real case studies and learn\n\nThis is not a big consultancy pitch nor I’m not pretending to scale this overnight.\n\nBefore I take this any further, I want honest feedback from people who actually run businesses:\n\n1. Would this kind of help be useful at all?\n2. Which part of your business feels the most “blind” right now.....inventory, margins, staffing, planning?\n3. Is this something you’d ever pay for if it saved time or money, or is it mostly a nice-to-have?\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing:\n\nwhat type of business you run (retail, food, services, etc.) or where decisions feel more like guesswork than clarity or even “this wouldn’t work” is a useful answer.\n\nThank you  \n",

          "text": "Small business advisor here, sharing a few thoughts - definitely a need, likely an opportunity, some obstacles to overcome.\n\nFirst, work out what you mean by “Small business”. When people tell me that’s their niche, I always follow up with “How do you define a small business?” and the answers vary wildly.\n\nTo me a small business is maybe 4-12 employees; I’ve seen definitions that go up to $50 million in annual revenue! And some people talk about solopreneurs as SMEs.\n\nThis is important for a few reasons. You want to know who you’re chasing for work, and make it easy for anyone who might refer you clients. I’ve learned from trial and error that my best clients are 12-48 employees - the vast majority of website enquiries and referrals I’ve received have been much smaller, where I’m often too expensive, making it a waste of time for everyone.\n\nMy other observation is that - outside of digital-native businesses like ecommerce - **most small businesses have very little data**.\n\nI would love, for example, to have an AI version of myself that could make a digital twin of the business and provide constant observations and suggestions. But most of my clients have an accounting platform, bits of disconnected marketing data, maybe some sales or workflow spreadsheets (I’ve often helped them build), and a LOT of stuff in people’s heads and guts.\n\nWorth noting at this point that I don’t work with retail or hospitality - and I guess those are two sectors with good POS data you could use? I avoid them because they’re B2C with low margins, and often too cheap to pay even for good advice.\n\nThe bigger the business, the more software, the more systems, the more consistent and accessible the data. So that’s perhaps your biggest challenge - what are the types and size of businesses that you want to work with, where you can actually help?\n\n**What would my clients pay for (and how much?)**\n\nThere’s definitely money to be made. I helped a law firm get clear on individual billing data - who was producing what, and how could people see that information sooner. That part of a wider project was around $25,000.\n\nI have a few trade / home services businesses that struggle to see daily revenue data - especially in advance. They have scheduling software, usually prices are recorded in their, but there’s no button that says “Next Wednesday you’ll do $20,000 but your target is $30,000”. Getting that data in arrears is unhelpful - give it to them early and you can charge.\n\nMarketing and sales is the other big one. Marketing agencies (and managers) love to report on “conversions”, by which they mean “converted into a lead”. Small business owners don’t care about “lead conversions” they want “converted into a paying client” - and yet showing that data, from enquiry to lead to sale to lifetime value - is surprisingly difficult for most SMEs. Being so close to the money, this is valuable and solutions can charge a lot.\n\nJust sticking with the data, I think you’ll be able to charge either a few thousand up front and/or a few hundred a month ongoing.\n\nIf you can also provide solutions and help execute the change, then clients will be worth tens of thousands per year.\n\nUnless you really do start chasing much larger businesses with solid consulting solutions. That’s now above my area of expertise, but many contracts there start in the hundreds of thousands!\n\nGood luck.",

Right now I’m leaning towards businesses that are *past survival mode* but not structured enough to justify a full-time analyst....probably owner-led teams with some software in place, but messy or disconnected data.\n\nI’m also very aware of the data problem you mentioned. A lot of this is intuition, gut feel, and partial systems. That’s actually why I’m trying to start with very narrow, decision-led use cases (like revenue visibility, customer mix, or near-term planning) rather than broad 'analytics'.\n\nAt this stage, I’m intentionally doing a few focused pilots to learn where real value shows up, document outcomes, and avoid building something generic too early. Long-term, I agree...anything close to cash flow or sales-to-value tracking is where owners will actually pay.\n\nReally appreciate you sharing concrete examples.... this gives me a much clearer frame to navigate this properly.\n\nBut finding and reaching out to potential customers still remains a main hurdle I would say!",
