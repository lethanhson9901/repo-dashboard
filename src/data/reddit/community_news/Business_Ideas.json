      "text": "Hey everyone. Today I'm going to share with you the most important knowledge that I've accumulated from starting 9 different companies, reading 59 books on business and personal development, and most importantly successfully breaking $2,000,000 in yearly revenue.\n\nMy goal is that if even 1 person reads this and it gives them the confidence to get started I will have contributed positively to somebodies life, and that brings me joy.\n\nNow let's go.\n\n# Pick a business model \n\nThis is the easiest part to get hung up on, the way I've conquered this obstacle is by realizing I don't have to reinvent the wheel. There are thousands of profitable business models in the world and if you truly want to live the dream of financial freedom and break the chains of the 9-5 you can very simply pick one and replicate it. Remember “good artists borrow, great artists steal.”\n\n**Okay, but how do I pick one? There are so many that it's hard to choose!** Don't worry I got you, choice paralysis is real, we all get it.\n\n*Here are the 3 variables you need to be investigating and doing the math around in order to pick the right business for you.*\n\nVariable #1 **- Cost to start up AKA barrier to entry:** This variable is identified by simply imagining what would go into starting this business. *What are the costs associated with those things?* Imagine you were starting a meal prep business, you would need the right kitchen equipment, plastic containers, the food itself, and the transportation to bring it to the clients. Investigate how much these things would cost you and total it up, the number you land on is the Barrier to Entry Cost, write this down.\n\nVariable #2 **- Skills needed to be successful in this industry:** Some businesses require experts, while others can utilize high school students at minimum wage. If you are already an expert in a field it may be easier to build something you are comfortable with but it's absolutely not a requirement. Out of the 7 companies I have built I was only fluent in 1 and my most successful I knew nothing about. Figure out which skills are needed and do some thinking, do you have access to people with these skills? Can you hire people with these skills? Can you learn these skills in a day on youtube? Typically the lower the skill needed the more simple a business will be and trust me you want simple because once you start doing millions in revenue the headaches will pile up.\n\nVariable #3 **- How long will it take to get this business operational?** You would be surprised how quickly you can start *most* businesses. In a matter of 2 weeks I had people calling my phone for my biggest company and all it took were some street signs. Do some thinking on how long it will take for you to buy all the necessary equipment and get that phone to ring. Do you need a website? Do you need equipment or a product that will take months to develop or get to you? I highly recommend starting with a business model that can be operational in under a month, I say this because in order to withstand the punches that the business world will throw at you it helps to see tangible progress. When you spend 6 months in R&D it's tough to stay motivated.\n\n# Personal tips for choosing your FIRST business model\n\n1. Don't start a business where you will need to raise money to be successful, chances are if you are reading this it's not happening. The people that successfully raise money typically have rich parents or already have a track record of success. Choose a model you have close to enough cash to fund yourself. (My businesses had barrier-to-entry costs ranging from as low as 1k to as high as 22k)\n2. Choose a model that doesn't require full-time experts, these people cost a lot of money to employ and they typically don't want the risk of working with a pre-cash flow business.\n3. Choose a model that you can spin up in a couple of weeks to a month.\n\nBy now you should have a couple of assets in your head, which model you like, the things you need and how much they cost, and which skills you will need to hire for or know yourself to be successful.\n\n# NOW WHAT?\n\nNow we build.\n\nDepending on your model you will have 1 or more of the following. Google Listing and Website.\n\nGoogle listing you can make yourself but unless you're experienced in web development and digital product marketing 100% do not do this yourself, it is a colossal waste of time and it will hurt your ability to make the phone ring because it will take months and months of iterating in order for it to be halfway decent. Hire someone to build a website for you, there are services that do it for a $300 startup fee and $100 a month. DON'T BUILD YOUR OWN SITE.\n\nWith the website/google listing live we now focus on sales and in order to do that we need to make the phone ring AKA drive leads. Depending on the industry you choose these are the magic tools that will bring you money.\n\n**GOOGLE PAY PER CLICK -** I can't stress this enough, it works. 99% of industries can utilize google PPC, Meal prep? PPC, Cleaning service? PPC, E-comm? PPC, Sex toys? ALSO PPC. (I spend roughly 5k a month on PPC, it's magic.) **AVERAGE SETUP COST $800**\n\n**Facebook Ads and Instagram ads -** Known your target audience before spending money here, does your audience live on these platforms? Does your industry fit on a social media platform where people are probably watching cat videos? **AVERAGE SETUP COST $600**\n\n**Angi's list and other contractor platforms -** The leads can be hit or miss but they absolutely will make your phone ring. **AVERAGE SETUP COST $350 MONTHLY**\n\n**Upwork and other freelance platforms -** Lower quality leads but a great way to cut your teeth in an industry. **SETUP COST FREE**\n\n**YARD SIGNS (Zip tied to telephone poles) -** I've used this in several of my businesses and it has driven hundreds of thousands of revenue, (Legal disclaimer I don't know the rules of your area, but in mine certain towns call us and say it's not allowed and others leave them up or take them down themselves) **you can get 50 signs for roughly $500 from your local sign maker.** those 50 signs could stay up for 10 years and drive you significant revenue. (Vista print signs are much cheaper quality than something you would get locally, if you want the sign to last years, don't skimp on the $50 you would save)\n\nThe equation is simple - How much does it cost to create 1 customer using X ad platform, and how much profit does 1 customer on average bring your business? if the profit created is higher than the cost to acquire the customer then it is a successful marketing strategy and you can dump thousands into it and consistently make a profit.\n\n**Okay but what if I don't know how to set up google PPC or Facebook ads?** NO PROBLEM I DONT EITHER!\n\nHere's where the special sauce comes in, listen carefully.\n\nWhen you don't know something, but you need it in order to build the business do this exactly.\n\n1. Go to Upwork or a similar site\n2. Create a detailed, simple, and KIND job posting that shows that you mean business and are serious about hiring for this position.\n3. Book calls with as many experts as you possibly can (I personally just put my phone number on the listing and open the floodgates because the scheduling process can be annoying)\n4. Talk to ATLEAST 6 experts describing what you need to accomplish and asking them specifically how they would go about accomplishing it if you were to hire them. (Ask as many questions as you possibly can)\n5. Use your best judgment to choose the highest-value contractor to achieve your goal.\n6. PROFIT? No, but really, I use this process probably 8 times a year, by speaking with experts for hours on end who are trying to win your business they will give you all the insight you need to have a working knowledge of a subject.\n\nDon't be afraid of the hourly rate they have, it usually ends up being a lot less hours than you would think\n\nDISCLAIMER: Freelance websites have a lot of low-quality contractors, DO NOT hire someone until you've talked to 6 people, you need to find the diamond in the rough. (Trust me they are there, I have found some incredible partners who I still have on retainer to this day)\n\nExamples of hires I have made through freelance websites\n\nWeb development, Graphics Design, Drawing up a sales contract, SEO, Fashion Designer, Logo Maker.\n\n\\*\\*Okay so now we a website/google listing and leads coming in, whats next?\\*\\*Fulfill the orders!! Sell those shirts, cook those meals, cut those lawns, develop those websites, WHATEVER IT IS JUST DO IT!\n\nThere is a 100% chance you will make mistakes and clients will get mad at you, welcome to the business world. Stand behind your work and make it right, don't do shady shit.\n\nI promise this is one of the most rewarding things you can do with your life, when done right it can pay you far more than any job would and more importantly give you your time back! Imagine only working 5 hours a week (From your cell phone) and getting paid 30k a month. That's only possible by owning your own business. Don't stop pushing, don't let the punches knock you out. Take what you deserve and never settle.\n\n# Managing Your Cash Flow\n\nYou can have $1M in sales and still go bankrupt if your bank account hits zero on rent day. This is the \"boring\" stuff that separates the amateurs from the $1M+ founders.\n\n**The \"Net-30\" Trap:** If you’re doing B2B (business-to-business), many clients won't pay you for 30, 60, or even 90 days. If you have to pay your contractors *today* but don't get paid for two months, you are effectively a bank lending money to your clients.   \n  \nAlways try to get a **50% deposit upfront** or use \"Progress Payments.\" Never finance a client's project with your own rent money.  \n  \n**The \"Profit vs. Cash\" Reality:** Profit is what’s left on paper. Cash is what’s in the bank. You need a \"War Chest\" of at least 3 months of operating expenses.\n\nAs soon as you make your first $5,000, don't buy a watch. Put it in a high-yield savings account. That is your \"Stay in the Game\" fund for when Google Ads gets expensive or a client disputes a charge.  \n  \n**Automate Your Accounting:** Spend the $30/month on software like QuickBooks or Xero immediately. If you wait until tax season to \"figure out your numbers,\" you’ve already lost. You need to see your **burn rate** (how much you spend monthly) in real-time.\n\n# Final general tips \n\nDO NOT try to do everything yourself, you are definitely not the best person to be doing it and you will kill yourself in the process. Bad end product and not sustainable, hire 1099 experts.\n\nLaunch before you're ready, do not try to make everything perfect, do not try to dot all your i's and cross all your T's it will never happen. The learning is in the doing, its in the mistakes, its in the mad clients.\n\nOutsource as much of the business as you can, find no-contract partners to do everything you don't know how to do. Example - I have an accounting partner, ($300 a month) a tax strategist partner ($2500 a quarter) an SEO partner ($1700 a month) a google PPC partner ($300 a month) a content creation partner ($800 a month)\n\nIt is better to be at the higher end of industry pricing for whatever market you are in, higher cost = higher margins and less headaches because it requires fewer customers. And oddly enough its the smaller customers that are the neediest.\n\nRemember to pay yourself first, never under any circumstances be the least paid person in the business. It is far too easy to get in the habit of oh ill make money next year. No make a profitable business now or go work for someone. Build a rock-solid foundation that lines your pocket and doesn't require 80 hours of your time a week.\n\nWell guys that's about all the writing I have in me, there is definitely more I wanted to include but its almost 5am where I'm currently living. I'm starting a discord for people who want help getting started (Think lists of softwares, people i trust in different industries ect) all 100% free just trying to give back to a community that I love so much. Send me a PM if you would like to be apart of it\n\nGood luck out there.",

The company itself is doing great and they still operate it. \n\nFor me, I fell out of love with the steady, slow-paced growth. The fun for me was the startup phase. It was exciting, I learned so much and I got to the point where I wanted to apply my knowledge to something completely new to see how I'd perform. \n\nSo I started another company about a few months after I sold my shares, and in 5 months I'm already back in the revenue stream in which I could afford to hire at least 3 full time employees.

Dave Parker definitely knows his stuff when it comes to the technical taxonomy of startups.\n\nI’m going to have to respectfully disagree with you on the \"Never go straight from brainstorming to building\" rule.\n\nIn my experience, especially for someone's *first* business, \"Customer Discovery\" can easily become a fancy term for procrastination. I’ve seen so many founders spend six months doing interviews, surveys, and \"iterative discovery\" without ever actually asking for a credit card number. They get stuck in a feedback loop where they’re solving problems that don't actually exist in a paying market.\n\nFor the types of service-based or high-intent businesses I’m talking about (like the ones that use Google PPC), the market is the discovery.  \n  \nIf I put up a landing page and $500 of PPC spend, and the phone doesn't ring? *That* is my customer discovery. It’s fast, it’s objective, and it doesn't rely on people \"nicely\" telling me they like my idea during an interview.\n\nI’m curious though. In your experience, where do you see the \"Build First\" method fail the hardest? Is it usually a product-market fit issue, or just people wasting money on an industry that’s already too saturated?",

          "text": "Thanks for posting. It’s a great summary. I don’t currently run a small business but I’ve worked for a few in the past - the Net 30 trap is a great call out. All of the small businesses I worked for had this problem, they had a few much larger companies as clients who could push these terms, one even had NET 90 days payment which really made it to manage cash flow. \n\nAnother great point is using Xero or quickbooks as they both have automated invoicing reminders. I spent a lot of time just chasing payments for these small businesses (the owners didn’t have time as they were focusing on winning new clients) so I agree getting deposits upfront and also adding late payment clauses can also really help. \n\nFinally just wanted to say thanks for calling out Google ads and digital marketing experts! That’s my full time job now. I first ran Google ads for a small design studio and it made a huge difference to their business, enough that I pursued it as a full time career. So if op or anyone in the comments has questions about it feel free to dm me :)",

This is usually the part that makes people the most nervous because it involves the law, but in my experience, the reality is much more about simple logistics than getting hit with a $10,000 fine on day one.\n\n# 1. The \"Fines\" vs. \"Warnings\" Reality\n\nI have never, in 9 businesses, seen a city lead with a heavy fine. It is almost always a \"Hey, take these down\" phone call first.\n\nThink about it from the city's perspective: they have to prove *who* put the sign up. Just because your number is on it doesn't mean you were the one who zip-tied it to the pole (technically). They usually start by calling the number and being annoyed. When that happens, I just say, \"Oh, I'm so sorry, I had a contractor putting those out. I'll have him go pull them right now.\" Then I just don't put them back in *that* specific town for a few months.\n\n**The exception:** Texas just passed a law (Sept 2025) that can actually hit up to $5,000 for \"bandit signs\" if you're a repeat offender. So, if you're in a state that's actively cracking down, you have to be smarter—put them up on Friday evening after the city offices close and take them down Sunday night.\n\n# 2. ROI: Yard Signs vs. Local Services Ads (LSA)\n\nI’m actually going to say something controversial: **For a brand new local biz, I find Yard Signs have a better** ***initial*** **ROI than LSA.** \\* **LSA (The Google \"Guaranteed\" checkmark):** These are amazing because you only pay per lead, but the barrier is high. You need a background check, insurance docs, and a bunch of reviews before you even show up. It can take weeks to get approved.  \n  \nYard Signs give you \"Social Proof\" before you have it. If someone sees a sign in their neighbor's yard (or even just at the entrance of their neighborhood), they assume you're the \"local guy.\"\n\nIn my most successful service biz, LSA leads were costing me about $35–$60 per phone call. With yard signs, I was getting calls for roughly $4–$7 per lead based on the cost of the signs vs. the volume of calls.",

      "text": "Let's talk about the legal trap. Do you actually need an LLC to start your business?\n\nI see this every single day. Someone has a killer idea for a junk removal business or a niche e-commerce store, and instead of finding their first customer, they spend three weeks obsessing over articles about Delaware S-Corps, registered agents, and operating agreements.\n\nThey haven't made a single dollar, but they’re already worried about protecting their assets.\n\nIf you haven't started yet, you don't have any business assets to protect.\n\nMy goal today is to save you from the administrative abyss that kills 90% of entrepreneurs before they even launch. I’ve started 9 companies. Some I LLC’d on day one (mistake), and others I didn't touch until we hit $10k a month.\n\nHere is the raw, unfiltered truth.\n\n# The Reality Check: Revenue vs. Paperwork\n\nThe biggest mistake you can make is confusing activity with progress. Filing paperwork feels like progress because you get a fancy document from the Secretary of State, but it doesn't put money in your bank account.\n\nIn the beginning, your only job is Validation. Does anyone actually want what you’re selling?\n\n* **The \"Solo\" Phase:** If you are just testing the waters, selling handmade candles on Etsy or mowing three neighbors' lawns, you are a **Sole Proprietorship** by default. You don't need to file anything. You are the business.\n\nAsk yourself, \"What is the worst-case scenario today?\" If you’re a consultant giving advice, the risk is low. If you’re performing surgery in your garage (please don't), the risk is high.\n\n# When to actually pull the trigger\n\nDon't get an LLC because you feel like a CEO. Get an LLC when the math and risk demand it. Here are the 3 variables I use to decide when it's time to file.\n\n**Variable #1 - The \"Sleep at Night\" Factor (Liability):** The primary purpose of an LLC (Limited Liability Company) is to create a \"corporate veil\" between your personal bank account/house and your business lawsuits.\n\n* **Low Risk:** Digital marketing, graphic design, writing, coaching. (You can wait).\n* **High Risk:** Construction, food service, childcare, physical products that could explode or choke someone. (Get the LLC early).\n\n**Variable #2 - The \"Professionalism\" Barrier:**\n\nAre you chasing B2B (Business to Business) clients? Big companies often won't cut a check to \"John Smith.\" They want to pay \"Smith Consulting LLC.\" If your business model requires a professional facade to even get a meeting, then the $300–$800 setup cost is just a marketing expense. Write it down and pay it.\n\n**Variable #3 - The Tax Pivot Point:**\n\nOnce you start making real money (usually around the $50k–$70k profit mark), an LLC allows you to elect **S-Corp status**. This is the \"magic trick\" that saves you thousands in self-employment taxes. But if you're making $0? An LLC actually *costs* you money in annual fees and franchise taxes.\n\n# Personal Tips for the Legal Phase\n\n* **Don't Hire a Lawyer Yet:** Unless you have partners (which I don't recommend for your first rodeo), do not spend $2,500 on a lawyer to file an LLC. Use a service like Northwest Registered Agent or even do it yourself on your State’s website for the cost of the filing fee. It takes 15 minutes.\n* **The \"Bank Account\" Rule:** The second you get that LLC, you **must** open a separate business bank account. If you mix your grocery money with your business revenue, you \"pierce the corporate veil\" and the LLC becomes a useless piece of paper. A judge will laugh at your \"protection\" if you're paying for Netflix out of the business fund.\n* **Insurance > LLC:** Most people think an LLC is a magic shield. It’s not. A good General Liability insurance policy ($500/year) will protect you more in the early days than a piece of paper from the government will.\n\n# THE \"SPECIAL SAUCE\" FOR FILING \n\nJust like I told you with PPC and Web Dev: If you don't know how to do it, don't waste 20 hours learning it.\n\n1. Go to your state's Secretary of State website.\n2. Look for the \"Articles of Organization\" form.\n3. If it looks like Greek to you, go back to Upwork.\n4. Hire a paralegal or a business filing expert for $100 to do the legwork for you. Don't pay anyone more than that.\n\nDO NOT let the lack of an LLC be the reason you haven't launched. I have seen \"entrepreneurs\" spend 6 months choosing a name and filing an LLC for a business that never made a single sale.\n\n# What’s the move?\n\nIf your business is low-risk, **start today**. Sell the product. Get the lead. Make the phone ring. Once you have $2,000 in the bank from actual customers, use $500 of that \"found money\" to file your LLC.\n\nBuild the engine before you paint the car.\n\nThe \"chains of the 9-5\" aren't broken by filing forms. They’re broken by generating revenue. Go get some.\n\nI'm still hanging out in the discord if you guys need a checklist of which states are the cheapest to file in or which insurance providers I use for my service businesses. It's all free.",

      "text": "Hey, this is just a shower thought. If businesses are already doing this then great but I just haven't seen it yet:\n\nHow about a subscription plan that gets cheaper the longer you're subscribed and thus rewards you for staying loyal to the business/brand? Let's be real: the economy sucks. While money is getting tighter, everything's becoming a subscription. If you're trying a subscription model, you're competing with a dozen other subscriptions. The customer's probably very hesitant to add one more to set and forget, so why not make the decision easier?\n\nMany services, when you cancel, will beg you to stay with a super marked-down price for like two or three months. From my perspective at least, when they pull this it feels like someone promising really hard to change when you wanna cut things off... only to go back to the same shit. Why not build a relationship with the customer before that: say \"hey, if you join us and stay with us, we'll hog less of your wallet.\"\n\nNow, obviously it wouldn't go down to $0. Maybe in a year a monthly subscription incrementally goes from $10 to $5 and stays that way. The point is that the customer sees value not just in the subscription and service but continuing to stick with it. Dropping the subscription would feel like throwing away a long-term benefit.\n\nI imagine this pressure would lead to higher retention. Sure some people are paying less but those are the people that stay, the people you can rely on the most.\n\nYou could probably handle cancellation however you want but personally I wouldn't cut off the benefit immediately; maybe just incrementally increase the subscription price each month they're away until it's back to the original.\n\nI don't really have anything I'd use this model for. I freelance articles and those prices are based on word count. I'm working on a webcomic and I'd probably just ask for donations each month in exchange for early releases and bonus content. But if anyone else thinks this is a good idea and wants to try it (or is doing it already), tell me how it goes! If you think it sucks, the downvote button is right there lol.",

But why would a business choose to be less profitable - when you can still cancel anytime.\n\nYes, the customer can cancel at any time, but if you compare two plans for the exact same service, economically a customer has less reason to cancel a $10 monthly subscription that becomes $5, than a $10 subscription that will always be $10. I guess it'd be akin to a growth-first model that tries to expand the customer base at expense of profit.\n\nAlso the variables can change depending on what's feasible. Maybe instead of going down to $5 it goes down to $7, or instead of going down over the course of a year it goes down over two years, or three.\n\n>Now a cheaper subscription to guarantee you remain a customer — like annual deals vs monthly are common already.\n\nYeah, there are annual deals, but they're not predicated on loyalty and will still spook your wallet. $100 seems steep whether it's 10% off, 20% off, 50% off, et cetera. As a first time subscriber, you don't know whether you're actually gonna need it or use it that much. Monthly savings over time requires less perceived upfront commitment from the customer.\n\n>Existing customers are a businesses most profitable center, they aren’t gonna shrink the golden goose.\n\n[It's already shrinking.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-subscription-era-is-over-the-purge-has-begun-in-america/) That's why cord-cutting services are becoming popular (while ironically also asking for subscriptions). This decade has been defined by a lot of economic uncertainty, so hard choices have to be made. I think it's more profitable to have a customer that pays a few dollars less a month than a customer that axes the expense altogether when they don't have a few extra dollars. That's why companies will beg you to stay at a significantly lower price if you threaten to cancel.",

Rising ad costs, supplier nightmares, margins that evaporate the second something changes with your supplier or platform.

The overhead alone makes it appealing.\n\nBut I'm skeptical of anything that sounds too easy after ecom burned me pretty bad. I've been looking at a few directions and trying to figure out where the real opportunity is vs what's just being hyped up by people selling courses.\n\nAffiliate content seems legit but competitive and slow to build. The ai influencer space keeps coming up in every community I'm in and the margins look solid on paper, but separating reality from people trying to sell you their playbook is hard. Niche youtube seems viable too but the runway before you see any real revenue is long and I don't love being on camera.\n\nFor anyone who pivoted from physical products to content or digital stuff, what was the reality vs expectations gap? I'm not looking for hype, genuinely trying to understand what the day to day looks like compared to running an ecom store.",

With ecom the pressure is supplier issues, ad volatility, shrinking margins, constant cash flow management, and daily operational fires. With content the pressure shifts to distribution platforms, algorithm swings, slow revenue ramps, and long consistency cycles before anything compounds.\n\nThe big illusion is that content feels lighter because there is no inventory. But instead of capital risk, you take time risk. In ecom you can usually tell within a month if something has traction. With content, it can take six to twelve months before the signal is real.\n\nIt is also more repetitive and more isolated than people expect. Monetization often trails audience growth by a lot. And algorithm shifts can hit just as hard as ad CPM spikes.\n\nAI influencer plays look attractive, but a lot of the flashy numbers come from selling the method, not the actual output. Affiliate and niche YouTube can work, but only if you treat them like media engineering, not casual posting.\n\nThe real fork is not which is easier. It is whether you prefer operational chaos with fast feedback or strategic patience with slower compounding. Very different stress profiles.",

The downside is slower feedback loops unless you’re running paid traffic to offers.\n\nIf you’re skeptical, that’s healthy. I’d test something small first.

Probably a good idea to talk with parents in your are and see what they think and how they'd feel about the way you're positioning it. \n\nThere's a definitely a way to do this that would support the community. We have grandparents that watch our kids but after a few hours the grandparents are exhausted and need a break.\n\nKids also appreciate consistency, so if you had a few people (managers, supervisors) \"run the show\" so to speak and have older generations come in and out it could be pretty cool, they could teach things like cooking, making lemonade and passing down some old stories. Start small, expand what works, change what doesn't. Seems cool though, keep us updated",

Both populations have weakened immune systems. If you co-locate the daycare with the residential facility you won't have a lot of easy ways to quarantine and clean if there's something like a viral outbreak.\n\nThen there's fitness. Is it difficult for people 60+ to get a job if they're fit and healthy enough to work in childcare - which is very physically demanding? Or are you going to largely get a population of people who *can't* find other employment.\n\nI'd probably look at a model where you have a traditional caretaker (whatever that looks like), working a normal shift and **supplemented** by elderly aides. The aides could rotate in with shorter shifts and lower frequency. Since they would be supervised, you could get away with lower training requirements.\n\nBecause the other issue I think you'll have is cost. Training people for a year is going to be expensive. What if they don't make it through the training? What if they do and then immediately decide the work is too difficult? Childcare is already an expensive business.",

      "text": "Finally pulling the trigger on a Pennsylvania LLC (Philly area) and have some quick questions about the Registered Office vs Registered Agent thing?\n\nI’m finally starting my own HVAC/handyman business here in Delco after talking about it for like three years. I’m doing the paperwork on the PA Business One-Stop Shop portal tonight, but I’m a little stuck on the \"Registered Office\" section.\n\nI know most states call it a \"Registered Agent,\" but PA seems to insist on a physical \"Registered Office\" address. I'm currently working out of my house. Is it a bad idea to just use my home address? I’ve heard horror stories about your personal address being plastered all over public records for every solicitor to find, but I don't really want to shell out $200/year for a CROP (Commercial Registered Office Provider) if I don't have to.  \n  \nAlso, I saw that PA just switched from that weird 10-year \"decennial\" report to a **yearly $7 report** starting last year. If I file my Certificate of Organization today (Feb 2026), is my first $7 report due by Sept 30th of *this* year, or do I get a pass until 2027?  \n  \nThe online portal mentions a \"Docketing Statement\" (Form DSCB:15-134A). Is this something I have to fill out separately, or does the system just generate it when I finish the Certificate of Organization?  \n  \nI’m thinking of calling it \"Delco Draft & Pipe LLC,\" but I read somewhere that PA is super picky about \"restricted\" words. Does anyone know if \"Draft\" is going to trigger some manual review because it sounds like a bank or something?\n\nAny advice from fellow PA small biz owners would be huge. Trying to avoid that $125 filing fee going to waste because I checked the wrong box.\n\nCheers!",

It is perfectly legal to use your home address in Delco, but yes, it will be public. If a solicitor (or an angry customer) searches your LLC on the DOS Business Search, your front door is what pops up.  \n  \nYou don’t *have* to pay $200. There are Pennsylvania-based CROPs (Commercial Registered Office Providers) that charge as little as **$50–$100 a year**. If you’re doing HVAC, you’ll be out at job sites all day; if a process server ever shows up with legal papers and you aren't home, that’s a \"failed service\" which can lead to other headaches. Using a CROP ensures someone is always there during business hours.\n\nAbout that new $7 Annual Report\n\nThis is a brand-new change (Act 122).  \n  \nThe Deadline: LLC reports are due by September 30th every year.  \n  \nYour 2026 Status: Since you are forming the business *this* year (Feb 2026), you generally get a pass for your first year. Your first $7 report should be due by September 30, 2027.  \n  \nKeep an eye out for a postcard or email from the Department of State in July/August 2027. They’re being lenient with penalties for the first two years (2025-2026), but starting in 2027, they’ll actually start dissolving LLCs that forget to pay.\n\nIf you use the online portal to file your Certificate of Organization, the system automatically generates the Docketing Statement info for you. It’s basically just a summary for the Department of Revenue so they know what kind of taxes you'll be liable for. You won't need to upload a separate PDF unless you were doing a paper filing.\n\n# ",

I'm planning to start a service-based business and I'll likely be operating in multiple states eventually, but starting off with Texas.\n\nI've been looking at Northwest Registered Agent and they seem to be darling of Reddit compared to other services like Legalzoom or Zenbusiness. But I'm always skeptical when it sounds too good to be true, or over-whelming good reviews. \n\nI've read that they let you use their office address on the actual Articles of Organization (not just for service of process). Does this actually work in Texas to keep my home address off the public record?  \n  \nThey claim they scan everything locally and notify you immediately. For those who use them, is the dashboard actually clean? There's a lot of talk about having Corporate Guides instead of a random call center. Has anyone actually called them with a weird question? Do they actually know their stuff, or is it just marketing speak for \"customer support\"?\n\nAnd since I'm looking at expanding, how easy is it to add a second or third state later? Is it a nightmare to manage multiple registered agents through one account?\n\nI had a friend who used a different LLC formation service, and while the first year was $0, the renewal fee jumped to like $300 without warning. I’ve also heard horror stories about some services selling your data to business credit telemarketers the second you file. Do Northwest actually respect your data, or am I going to get 50 calls a day for business loans once I sign up?\n\nIf you've used them recently (especially in 2025/2026), I’d love to hear the good, the bad, and the ugly.",

That is usually where people get surprised.\n\nFrom what I have heard, the dashboard and scanning are solid and the appeal is consistency and privacy rather than bells and whistles. The bigger risk is not the service itself but forgetting about renewals or assuming everything is covered automatically.\n\nIf you are expanding to multiple states, having one provider can simplify things, but costs add up quickly so it helps to be very intentional about where you actually need to register versus where you are just operating remotely.",

A shared creative space solves a real problem for musicians who do not have access to gear, space, or a community to collaborate with.\n\nThe biggest thing I would think about early is usage patterns. Gyms work because people come regularly and equipment scales well. Music spaces tend to be more bursty. Someone might come a lot for a few weeks and then disappear. That does not kill the idea, but it affects how memberships should be structured and priced.\n\nNoise control, scheduling, and wear on equipment are also real operational challenges. You would probably want very clear time slots, booking rules, and accountability so it does not turn into chaos or burnout for whoever is running it.\n\nWhere this really shines is community. If people feel like they belong there and not just rent a room, retention becomes much easier. Group jams, beginner friendly sessions, and hosted events could matter more than the gear itself.\n\nOverall it feels viable if started small and local, almost like a pilot space. If you can prove people show up consistently and bring friends, that is when the membership model really starts to make sense.",

Traditional vending works because it can be dropped almost anywhere. As soon as you require plumbing, permits, and ongoing sanitation checks, your buyer is no longer a vending operator, it is a venue operator who already has alternatives like fountains or bar soda guns.\n\nSanitation is also not a small problem. Anything involving reusable nozzles, ice, or exposed liquid creates maintenance and liability costs that can easily erase the margin advantage unless you solve this with a very simple, very robust design.\n\nIf I were pressure testing this, I would first ask where this works better than existing options. High foot traffic venues that do not want staff involvement but already have water access might be the only real fit. Offices, gyms, campuses, hospitals. If you cannot clearly name the buyer and the installation decision maker, that is where most hardware ideas die.\n\nNot saying it cannot work, but the success here is less about soda economics and more about installation friction, compliance, and who actually says yes.",

Now you can go stay with them a few weeks/months and attend school or even just five days.  \n\nLet's say your family are snowbirds and want to leave Minnesota for obvious reasons.... they can fly to their home in Sunny Arizona and pop into class without it being a disaster. The curriculum is 70% the same lessons on the same day and 30% creativity/unique for the teacher. \n\nIn our town Olympic hopeful kids do high school in the summer and get the winter off to train their snow sports. \n\nLet's say your family is well off and like to travel to their various homes... NYC and Florida.... they can turn the weekend into five nights and two of those days the kids can attend school in Florida while Mom has a spa day.\n\nLet's say you have a dying relative in another town you want to spend six weeks with and you already work remote.... no problem.... your kids can pop into that local school while you comfort the relative. \n\nThis seems like such a convenience. The states should allow this multi-state system up.\n\nWhen I was young kids got cut off from their fathers. Mothers moved away and Dads only saw them at the holidays and summer. This caused a lot of heartbreak. \n\nThis will also let kids go stay with grandparents in a different town if parents have a big work conference or temp projects/ assignments. ",

He is extremely knowledgeable in his area, and honestly, with how many people have been asking for his help lately, I think he’s going to be really successful.\n\nMy question is about the paperwork side of things. We are in the process of getting the LLC through the Ohio Secretary of State (using the Ohio Business Central site). After we get the Articles of Organization back and the $99 is paid... do we just… start? Can he just start taking customers and invoicing them?\n\nI’m planning on heading to the Huntington or Chase branch down the street to get a business bank account once the filing is approved, but I feel like we are missing a step somewhere.\n\nA few specific things I’m worried about. Should I put myself as the Statutory agent for this, but do I need to do anything else for it? Vendor's License**,** since he’s doing a service, do we need one of these from the county auditor?\n\nI just want to make sure we don't get six months down the road and realize we’re \"illegal\" or something because we missed a random filing.

And bicycles are a no-go too slow and stressful.\n\nWhen I mentioned it to friends, someone suggested a motorcycle with side car.\n\nAt first I laughed, but the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. Extra space, better balance for loads, less strain on my back. I even checked Alibaba and the listings were surprisingly within my savings.\n\nThe problem is… I’ve barely seen them on these streets.\n\nSo now I’m confused.

I'm currently at a crossroads with my business structure. I've lived outside my home country for a while now, and since the tax burden back home is spiraling, I'm looking for a more stable and cost-effective way to manage my income. \n\nI only need to issue one invoice per month. My research keeps pointing toward New Mexico as the best pick for low-maintenance setups, but I’m looking for some real-world sanity checks before I file.\n\nNM LLC seems to be the cheapest in the US. $50 filing fee and $0 annual report fees. I compared it to California’s $800 yearly tax or even Wyoming’s annual report, it feels like a steal.   \n  \nI’m not looking for complex tax shelters. I just want a straightforward structure to receive USD and keep my accounting clean. And I know New Mexico is famous for privacy, but honestly, I don't really care about that. I just want a structure that won't give me a headache during taxes.\n\nHOWEVER, I’ve heard that even if the LLC is easy to set up, getting a business bank account (like Mercury or Relay) as a non-resident can be a coin toss. Has anyone done this recently? Do I really need a physical US address, or will a CMRA (mail forwarder) suffice?\n\nI know I need an EIN to do anything. I’ve heard the \"faxing the SS-4\" route for non-residents is taking ages lately. Is it still taking 4–6 weeks, or has it gotten better?\n\nI’m planning to use a registered agent service to handle the initial filing. But before I pay the fees, I want to know, has anyone here actually regretted going the New Mexico route? \n\n",

A registered agent address and most mail forwarders/CMRAs are exactly what a lot of fintech compliance teams reject. If you don’t have a stable address (even abroad), that’s where people get stuck.\n\nOn EIN: if you don’t have an SSN/ITIN, you’re typically doing SS-4 by fax or calling the IRS international EIN line. Officially, fax can come back quickly if you include a return fax number, but delays do happen, so build buffer time.\n\nAlso, tax reality check: an LLC is not tax residency.
