      "text": "I made $200 in the last 2 weeks from mine. Proof in comments if you don’t believe me.\n\nMy goal is $2k/month by end of year. And no, I’m not going hard on this, I’m putting in maybe 1-2 hours a week. So that’s why it’ll take 10 months instead of 2. Slow and steady but basically passive so I’m not complaining.\n\nAnyway here’s what I’m doing if you want to copy it:\n\nNiche first\n\nFinance pays the best CPMs but don’t just do “finance.” Go specific. Finance for single moms, stock market for complete beginners, that kind of thing. AI is also a solid bet right now, it’s genuinely exploding. Health, dating, local news — all work too. Just pick something and commit.\n\nBuild it like a company not a diary\n\nSeriously don’t attach your name to it. You want something you could sell one day. A newsletter with your name on it is a freelance gig. A newsletter brand is an actual asset. Different things.\n\nPlatform\n\nSubstack is free and fine for starting. I use beehiiv. Better customization and they have their own ad network built in, which means you can monetize from day 1 without finding a single sponsor yourself. That alone sold me on it.\n\nGetting subscribers\n\nThis is where most people get stuck. Options are:\n\nMeta ads — reliable but expensive. beehiiv has a paid boost feature too where other newsletters basically send their readers your way. Both cost money though.\n\nFree route is content. X, LinkedIn, Reddit. Reddit has been my main thing. I post about side hustles, people find value in it, they subscribe. Got around 150 new subs just last week from Reddit. This exact type of post is how I do it.\n\nSending issues\n\nJust send consistently. AI helps a lot with organizing and formatting but you still have to know how to use it properly or the output is terrible. I use it as a tool not a ghostwriter.\n\n(Writing this post myself by the way, hence the grammar crimes lol)\n\nMoney\n\nSmall newsletter? Use the beehiiv ad network. I’m at 2k subscribers and making $15-20 per issue from it. Not retiring off it but I’m sending the newsletter anyway so it’s basically found money.\n\nHit 5k and you can start going after real sponsors — $100 to $400 per placement depending on your niche. That’s when it gets genuinely interesting.\n\nYou can also do digital products or affiliate stuff on top of that. Multiple streams from the same audience.\n\nAutopilot\n\nOnce you’re at 5k, set up a beehiiv boost at like $1.50-$2 per subscriber. Keep some budget running and you get new subscribers without doing anything.\n\nFor the actual issues, either get a VA or build out an AI workflow that does the heavy lifting. You just review and send. Sponsors tend to stick once you have a relationship going.\n\nEnd result: $2k/month for a couple hours of work a week. That’s the goal anyway.\n\nIf you want to go bigger — $15k, $50k, $1M/month (yes those newsletters exist) — that’s a whole different level of effort. But that’s not what this post is about.\n\nStarted writing this thinking it’d be 200 words. Oops.\n\nDrop any questions in the comments, happy to answer. Proofs going in comments too 👇​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "text": "Millions of freelancers and devs outside the US - Latin America, Eastern Europe, India, Nigeria - desperately want a US LLC. Not because they live here, but because it unlocks Stripe, PayPal, US clients, and real banking. The demand is huge.\n\nThe actual cost to set someone up? Embarrassingly low. Wyoming LLC formation (\\~$99 via [InCorp](https://www.incorp.com) for example) + registered agent (\\~$129/year) = under $230 total. That's your cost base.\n\nBut foreigners don't do it themselves because the process has some issues\n\n1. EIN can't be applied online without a US SSN. Non-residents fax Form SS-4 and wait 2-5 weeks (one wrong field = start over) 2) Foreign-owned LLCs must file Form 5472 annually or face a $25K IRS penalty - most people find out *after* the fact 3) Opening a US bank account as a non-resident has gotten significantly harder since 2024\n\nNone of this is complicated. It's just confusing and terrifying if English isn't your first language.\n\nThe business: \"done for you\" setup service. You handle everything, charge $400-600, keep $200-400 margin per client. But the real opportunity is going niche - Spanish-speaking founders, Indians dealing with FEMA compliance, Nigerians locked out of Stripe Atlas. Each is an underserved community with zero localized competition.\n\nThe knowledge barrier is real but learnable. And for these clients, a US LLC isn't a nice-to-have - it's the difference between getting paid or not.\n\nAm I missing something?? I think it's to good to be true, that's why I'm asking you to give some feedback",

          "text": "It’s not “too good to be true”, but it’s not as simple as it looks.\n\nA few realities you should think about:\n\n**1. Compliance risk is real.**  \nIf you mess up EIN, 5472, BOI reporting, or state filings, you’re not just losing a client, you’re exposing them to penalties. That $25k 5472 fine isn’t theoretical. You’ll need airtight processes and probably legal/accounting backing.\n\n**2. Banking is the real bottleneck.**  \nLLC formation is easy. Getting a usable US bank account without visiting physically is getting harder. If you can’t reliably solve that, your offer weakens.\n\n**3. Trust > pricing.**  \nForeign founders wiring $500+ to someone abroad need extreme trust signals, content, testimonials, community presence. This is a credibility business.\n\n**4. Long-term liability.**  \nAre you just forming LLCs? Or are you becoming their de facto compliance advisor every year? Recurring filings are opportunity… but also responsibility.\n\nThe niche angle (Spanish founders, Indian devs, etc.) is smart. But this is closer to a regulated services business than a simple arbitrage play.\n\nThe opportunity is real. The risk is in execution and liability, not demand.",

          "text": "The demand is absolutely real, we see it every day at Foothold America. But a few people in this thread have touched on the thing that makes this harder than it looks on paper, and it's not the formation itself.\n\nThe compliance tail is where this gets complicated. You're not just filing some paperwork and collecting a fee. Foreign-owned LLCs have ongoing IRS obligations that most formation services either don't explain properly or don't handle at all. Form 5472, BOI reporting, understanding what creates a tax nexus, these aren't one-time tasks and if your client misses them you're the person they're calling when the $25k penalty arrives.\n\nBanking is also genuinely getting harder, not easier. Anyone positioning this as a simple arbitrage play is probably underestimating how much has changed since 2024 with KYC requirements. That's actually where most clients hit a wall after the formation is done.\n\nThe niche angle is smart though. Spanish-speaking founders, Indian devs navigating FEMA on top of IRS requirements, these are real underserved communities and the trust problem is solvable if you're actually embedded in those communities. Generic formation services like Stripe Atlas and Firstbase don't do that.\n\nThe businesses that do this well treat it as a proper advisory service rather than a document filing operation. That's a much higher bar but also why there's still room in the market. ",

The margin you’re imagining ($400-600 revenue, $200-400 profit per client) assumes nobody else is competing. They are.\n\n\t2.\tSpecialized competitors are better - doola, Globalfy, USFormation were built for this. They have:\n\t∙\tRelationships with banks that accept non-residents\n\t∙\tForm 5472 compliance built in\n\t∙\tWhatsApp/multilingual support\n\t∙\tEIN process figured out for non-residents\n\t∙\t1000s of testimonials\nYou’d be starting from zero with these advantages.\n\n\t3.\tEmbedded is eating the future - Tailor Embedded lets SaaS companies embed LLC formation directly into their products as an API feature . This means the real value is moving to who controls the customer relationship, not who processes the paperwork.\n\n\t4.\tBanking is still the real bottleneck - Most review sites explicitly mention that banking is where non-residents get stuck after formation, and companies like doola partner with specific banks to handle this . You can’t solve that with a SaaS alone.\n\nMy Take:\nNot worth building another general LLC formation SaaS.\n\nThe Reddit post made it sound like free money. It’s not. The real opportunity isn’t LLC formation—it’s compliance and accounting after the LLC exists.",

Direct mail was \"dead\" in 2012. Both are still generating insane ROI for the people who stuck around after the crowd left.\n\nRight now I think the same thing is happening with voice. Everyone moved to text-only funnels because calls felt intrusive. But there's a gap between \"cold call that interrupts someone's day\" and \"completely silent outreach\" - and some small operators are quietly exploiting it.\n\nI've seen some businesses built around this logic\n\n\\- local home services (HVAC, roofing, solar) using ringless voicemail to follow up on quote requests - no ring, message goes straight to voicemail, callbacks at 8-12%\n\n\\- insurance brokers automating policy renewal reminders with a cloned version of their own voice - personal feel at zero marginal effort\n\n\\-small medical practices that cut no-shows by 60%+ just by switching from email reminders to voicemail drops\n\nNone of these are *glamorous*. None require VC. They're just service businesses that figured out a channel arbitrage before their competitors noticed.\n\nThe business idea isn't necessarily \"build a voicemail company.\" It's: pick any local services niche, add a layer of outreach that your competitors are too lazy or too trendy to use, and own that communication advantage.\n\nWhat abandoned channels have you seen making a quiet comeback?",

Once it feels human, response rates can sit in the 15 to 25 percent range for local offers. Community papers and trade mags are similar. Smaller reach, but way higher intent. A roofing company doesn’t need 100k impressions, it needs 20 homeowners ready to buy. Same with meetups. Ten solid conversations can outperform 10k cold impressions. On the CRM question, I wouldn’t call it abandoned, more underused. Most businesses use maybe 30 percent of what their CRM can actually do. The opportunity isn’t the tool, it’s operational discipline. The companies squeezing real value out of CRM data are usually the boring ones quietly compounding while everyone else chases the next shiny channel.",

Hitting all three can help you figure out what you *can't* call it.\n\nBest bets are to keep it simple, easy to spell/memorize, and something that isn't just a bunch of keywords. (You know, the way everything seems to be called \"Midnight Sun\" or \"Arctic\" something or other if it's north enough, or \"Lakeside\" or \"Lakeshore\" if there's a relevant body of water nearby, etc. Means you'll be competing for brand recognition and keywords in a really crowded field.)",

Ask 10–15 people in that group what they actually struggle with, then write guides or tiny tools for that one problem. I’ve used things like Notion and Beehiiv for simple MVPs, and lately Pulse for Reddit helps me spot threads where people basically describe their problems in public and test ideas fast. Pick one narrow problem, validate it with conversations, then ship something tiny and see if anyone cares enough to use it twice.",

I live in india and 80% of the furniture market is unorganized with no brands still. I was thinking of making a business that only has tables. Y'all seen those trendy side tables which look likes dice. I was thinking of starting something as such.\n\nA good collection of Side tables- Designed with modern themes(like those chess board tables), inbuilt charging sockets, equipped with lamps and whatnot.\n\nA lot could be done with these honestly. And I think it can be sold if marketing and branding is done well. Main problem is with margins. I am not sure what margins I can save for cashflow. Knowing that logistics would eat a lot of it so I need to know if it's a profitable and scalable business.  \nCan anyone give me an idea about what Net margins i can expect. And what are the problems with furniture business?",

The more specific you are (for example: inbox + community + newsletter support for coaches/therapists/studios), the easier it is to justify higher pricing and avoid competing with low-cost general VAs.\n\nGetting clients may feel slow at first, but once you land 1–2 who trust you, referrals tend to compound pretty quickly in that space.\n\nOut of curiosity are you planning to package this as fixed monthly retainers or hourly services?",

Add boundaries: working hours, channels you use, what’s “urgent,” and a cap on revisions for video.\n\nMain point: sell clear monthly packages around “we keep your audience and clients taken care of,” not random hours of admin work.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I am considering starting a business in a space I am familiar with - product support/customer support.  \n\nI have two paths I was thinking about going. One is b2b where I would offer training to small tech companies who are expanding their help desk support. The idea is that these companies often hire on technical ability and there employees may suffer from communication issues if they are customer facing. In a previous role I've had as a product support engineer, I've had this exact training by a third party my company would hire. \n\n  \nThe alternative path would be to offer a career-oriented skills training bootcamp as a b2c. This would be a similar training to the corporate training, but would be offered to individuals. It would assess their communication abilities and help orient them to software customer support roles. The training would be marketed as a way to break into tech, as many software companies, especially at enterprise level, offer customer support as part of their contracts. Even if AI is implemented into low tier tickets, real agents are still used for escalation. \n\n  \nI like the idea of the training for consumers as a way to build out the training and get real testimonials, and then pivoting towards the corporate training down the line, as getting corporate contracts would be much more difficult. \n\n  \nFor those with experience, does this idea sound like something a consumer would use, or is it better to try to jump directly to b2b?",

          "text": "Love this question — you’re thinking about the right things early.\n\nMost founders assume “premium” = expensive packaging. It doesn’t. Premium is alignment.\n\nHere’s what actually makes a sock brand feel high-end from day one:\n\n# 1. The Product Has to Justify the Box\n\nBefore packaging, make sure:\n\n* The knit density feels substantial (not thin or airy)\n* The toe seam is clean and comfortable\n* The elastic holds without biting\n* The sock recovers shape after stretch\n\nIf someone opens the box and the sock feels average, perception collapses instantly.\n\nPackaging amplifies quality — it doesn’t create it.\n\n  \n\n\n# 2. What Makes Packaging Feel Premium (Without Overspending)\n\nFrom a customer psychology standpoint, these elements matter most:\n\n**• Simplicity**  \nMinimal design with confident whitespace. Overdesign looks amateur.\n\n**• Material weight**  \nThicker stock, matte finishes, soft-touch coating. Glossy thin boxes feel cheap fast.\n\n**• Cohesion**  \nOne strong brand color + clean typography beats multiple loud elements.\n\n**• Structure**  \nRigid boxes feel premium. But early-stage brands don’t need them for every SKU.\n\n  \n\n\n# 3. Smart Early-Stage Packaging Strategy\n\nIf you’re watching MOQs and cash flow (which you should be), here’s the smarter path:\n\n**Start with stock packaging + custom branding overlays.**\n\n* High-quality kraft or rigid stock box\n* Custom belly band, sleeve, or sticker\n\nThis gives you:\n\n* Flexibility if you tweak branding\n* Lower minimums\n* Lower risk\n\nOnly move into fully custom printed packaging once you’ve validated volume.\n\n  \n\n\n# 4. Alibaba vs Uline vs Packlane\n\nHere’s the real breakdown:\n\n**Alibaba**\n\n* Lowest unit cost at scale – High MOQs – Freight, duties, delays – Quality inconsistency risk\n\n**Uline**\n\n* Fast\n* Reliable – Higher per-unit cost – Less brand differentiation\n\n**Packlane / Paper Mart**\n\n* Good middle ground\n* Easier customization – Still need to watch MOQs\n\nWhat many founders underestimate is *time*. Waiting 8–12 weeks on packaging while product is ready can stall momentum.\n\nSometimes paying 15–20% more for speed is worth it.\n\n  \n\n\n# 5. Mistakes to Avoid Early\n\n• Overbuilding the box before you have demand  \n• Choosing packaging that increases fulfillment time  \n• Making the box too big (shipping cost killer)  \n• Ignoring how repeat customers experience it\n\nIf you’re building a gifting brand, invest heavier in presentation.\n\nIf you’re building a daily essential brand, keep it understated and recyclable.\n\n  \n\n\n# 6. Think About Margin Early\n\nPremium positioning isn’t just visual — it’s structural.\n\nMake sure your COGS allow:\n\n* Healthy margins (70%+ if possible)\n* Paid ads\n* Wholesale expansion later\n\nIf packaging eats 20–30% of your product cost early, scaling becomes painful.\n\n  \n\n\nWe’ve helped a lot of early-stage brands navigate this balance between premium perception and operational reality. If it helps, you can see how we approach custom and private label builds here:\n\n👉 [https://deadsoxy.com/custom](https://deadsoxy.com/custom)\n\nThe biggest takeaway:  \nPremium is consistency, not extravagance.\n\nDial in the product.  \nKeep the packaging intentional.  \nProtect your margins.  \nScale thoughtfully.\n\nThat’s how you build something that lasts.",

I live in Mapleton, a town of about 5,100 people, but it gets around 1.3 million tourists a year because of our summer music festival, a weekend car show, and hiking trails nearby. I’m considering putting a boxing punch machine outside a busy café or near the festival area. Something that’s low-effort but could be a fun little attraction for visitors. I’ve looked at different machines online, Alibaba, Amazon, even eBay. A lot of reviews mention that water-filled bases tip or leak, so sand seems more reliable. Durability is key since it could see hundreds of hits on a busy weekend. Pricing per play is tricky too: I want it to cover costs and maybe generate a bit of profit, but still cheap enough that people actually give it a try instead of walking past. Has anyone tried something like this in a tourist-heavy area? Do these machines really make money consistently, or is it more of a novelty that wears off fast? How much maintenance should I expect, and is there anything I should watch out for if it’s outside all day? I’m also wondering if placement really matters, would near a café work better than a high-traffic street corner? Would love to hear real experiences, numbers, or tips. I’m trying to figure out if a boxing punch machine could actually be a sustainable little side hustle instead of just a flashy gimmick.",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nMy wife and I are thinking about launching a mobile food cart (a dream we’ve had for a while), but we’re total newbies to the business side of things. We’ve heard that an LLC is a good idea for protection, but we have zero clue how to actually get one set up in Georgia.\n\nIs the paperwork something two people can manage on their own, or is it worth paying someone to do it for us? Also, any Georgia specific quirks or fees we should know about before diving in?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s started an LLC here recently, especially if you were as clueless as we are. Appreciate any advice.\n\nThrough initial research, we originally started with Inc Authority but we got a called yesterday telling us we needed to pay an additional $292 dollars on top of that $182 we’d already paid for documents they claim are required. I can’t find any reference to these documents and the reps tone change when I told him we wouldn’t be paying this extra fee. These forms they claim I didn’t submit but there’s nothing in our portal and no forms were required.\n\nI’ve seen Zenbusiness recommended but after filling out the information I see they are charging us $225 for the GA state fee, the GA state fee is only $105, which they also state on their website.\n\nWe’ve already had a bad experience with registered agents and we’re not keen to jump into another situation.",

Biggest thing is if you want to have yourself as the registered agent or pay for someone to be one for you. Only difference is really if you get served for some reason it would go to the registered agent instead of you which can be nice for privacy but I'd research agents if you go that route as some are notoriously bad and do not let you know if you have been served. The cost isn't expensive to do this yourself you will get tons of soliciting for filling a new business telling you need this and that and they are required by law to tell you if it's a solicitation. For food I'm not to sure I am a saas service so there might be some difference but probably not to big. I'd recommend finding some food trucks and talking to them as they will probably have the best info for you. Another thing to note is you have to file a BOI with FinCEN it is free but required by the government, basically just says who owns the business to prevent money laundering this was newly required last year and comes and goes when they require it vs not needing it.",

It must be unique and have the words \"\"LLC\"\" or \"\"Limited Liability Company\"\" in it.\n\n2. Registered Agent: Your LLC will need a registered agent to sign for legal papers. A person or a business can be a registered agent.\n\n3. File Articles of Organization: This is the most important paper you need to start your LLC. You will send it to the Georgia Secretary of State, and the fee to file it is $100. This can be done online.\n\n4.An operating agreement is not mandatory in Georgia; however, it is advisable to have one in order to delineate the operations of your LLC and prevent potential issues.\n\n5. Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN) An Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS is required in order to employ personnel or establish a separate business bank account. This can be accomplished for free via the internet.\n\n6. Sign up for state taxes: If your business sells goods or services, you need to sign up for sales tax with the Georgia Department of Revenue.\n\n7. Annual Registration: You have to pay $50 each year to file your annual registration. It's due on the same day as the anniversary of your LLC's formation.\n\nNeed Help?\nYou can do all of this on your own, but if you'd rather not have to deal with any surprises or extra fees, you might want to think about using a service like BusinessAnywhere. I have personally employed them and was impressed by the simplicity and clarity of their process.They helped me with everything and made sure there were no surprise charges. If you're not sure you can handle all the paperwork on your own, this is definitely something to think about. I hope everything goes well with your mobile food cart! It sounds like a fun and interesting project.",

Filing yourself is pretty easy, if you list yourself as registered agent, your address will be listed publicly. \n\nSince it's a mobile food cart, I'm assuming you'd list your home address. If you decided to do this, please look into what you're agreeing to by being your own registered agent in Georgia. I personally think that hiring a registered agent service for your Georgia LLC is better as it will keep your address of public records and also give you peace of mind. ",
