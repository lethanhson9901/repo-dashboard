      "text": "TL;DR: I run AI Influencers on social media, copy viral trends and videos to go viral, then funnel to paid sites.\n\n\nI'm sure you've heard of this business recently, it's becoming more and more common as the barriers to entry are shrinking.\n\nI have been doing this for about 7 months, making good money so I can even do it full time. You don't even need hardware anymore, no comfy. I use Higgsfield and Wavespeed mainly, and you can probably get enough content with $20-$50/month (depending on how much you generate) and can rven do it from your phone.\n\nThe main contributor to success is consistency + patience. If your Influencer is attractive, she/he will go viral eventually, it may take a couple weeks but it will happen.\n\nI just copy viral dances and thirst traps, then funnel my traffic to paid sites where they can buy content, chat, subscribe etc. \n\nMy Current Workflow:\n1. Generate a base inage in Nanobananapro \n2. Find a reference video (reel or a tiktok) and upload it to Kling Motion Control\n3. Create an image imitatibg the first frame of the reference video, via Nanobananapro (with your base image as a reference)\n4. Combine (without a prompt) in Kling Motion Control\n5. Post consistently daily across TikTok/Instagram/Threads/Reddit\n6. Create a paid subscription site (Patreon/FV etc.)\n7. Funnel social media traffic there via stories and CTAs\n \n\nI'll try answer any questions here :) I have some examples of what I post on my reddit profile ",

          "text": "Just my opinion. \n1. I’m from 2 years in this business and I can tell you that it’s not so easy as it sounds. \nWhy? Ok you’ll create the content (both SFW and NSFW), you’ll become viral on social media (you have to know how, I mean you’ve to warm up your social media accounts to be able to target only US audience - easy, but you must to have consistency in your work, your account&content should looks authentic, legit. \nYou don’t have to rush because this will be very dangerous for your newly created social media accounts (you can get a shadow ban or even a ban). \nThen in social media you’ll have a rate of conversion that could be a low one or a good one based on what you’re doing. \nYou’ll get subscribers to your Fanvue account, this is the most difficult part. \nYou’ll get people who are willing to pay your subscription fee (4.99-9.99$) but some of them are expecting to see NSFW completely for free. \nThis is why a chatter is very important because she’ll engage with your subscribers and she’ll make them (using a chatting script) to buy over and over your PPV content (the most important sale that you can have on OF, Fansly, Fanvue). \nThe money from subscription fee… are nothing compared with the money that comes from selling content.\n\nSo the business it’s not a childish thing. \n\nWhat OP is trying to do, maybe to sell his method, it’s not my business and if he is good and if he can prove this point (so not just words, talking) it’s like a side source of income for him. \nIf he’ll ask for 30,50$ for this method like a one time price then… I don’t know. \n\nTo answer to someone comment that said that this is not a business that have a future (3 years) - Look the point is that you are not sure about anything nowadays, neither a regular job. Check what’s happening in IT industry. \nIf you have a business, I’m speaking in general, that can generate 10k,20k, 50k $ monthly even for a short period like 6 months - 1 year it’s good enough because if you are not retarded and you’ve your mindset for businesses then you can invest your money in another business. \nThis is about in businesses, to adapt to the changes, to the businesses environment, to the world.",

      "text": "this started because i got laid off from my marketing job last may and had about 6k in savings. instead of immediately job hunting i decided to give myself 4 months to try building something online. spoiler: it took longer than 4 months and the results were… mixed but interesting.\n\nthe idea came from noticing how many travel tiktok and instagram accounts were just stock footage with voiceovers and text overlays. figured i could do that but with a more personal angle, like a fictional travel blogger persona who visits places and gives tips. the twist was i didnt want to be on camera myself. partly privacy concerns, partly just not comfortable with it.\n\nfirst two months were rough. i tried using basic stock footage and canva templates. got maybe 200 followers total across platforms. the content felt generic because it was generic. people could tell it was just repurposed clips they'd seen elsewhere.\n\nmonth three i started experimenting with ai generated visuals. the landscape changed a lot in late 2023 and early 2024 with all these tools popping up. i tried midjourney for location shots which worked okay but the people always looked off. like the face would be slightly different every single generation. one image she'd have a rounder nose, next image it was more pointed. eyes would shift from hazel to straight up green between posts. followers notice that stuff even if they cant articulate why something feels wrong.\n\nspent probably three weeks testing different platforms. artflow was decent for video stuff. tried APOB for the portrait consistency thing. runway for some motion effects. honestly they all had tradeoffs and i ended up using a combination plus manual photoshop touchups for anything that looked slightly off. the key was getting a character that looked consistent enough that followers wouldnt notice the ai aspect immediately.\n\nby month five i had a system. my fictional persona was a 28 year old woman who travels solo and focuses on budget destinations in southeast asia and eastern europe. i was posting 2 reels per day on instagram and 3 tiktoks. each piece of content took about 25 minutes to make once i had the workflow down.\n\nthe growth was slow but steady. hit 3k followers on instagram around month six. tiktok was more volatile, had one video randomly get 89k views about visiting georgia (the country) on 40 dollars a day. that brought in about 1.2k followers overnight but most of them didnt stick around.\n\nmonth seven i tried monetizing through affiliate links for travel gear and booking platforms. this is where reality hit. made exactly 127 dollars that month. not nothing but definitely not quitting your job money. the issue was engagement. people would watch the content but the trust factor wasnt there for clicking through and buying stuff.\n\nthe moment that really crystallized this for me was when someone commented asking if she could do a live q&a about solo travel safety tips. had like 40 people agree and ask for it in the replies. obviously i couldnt do that. i just replied something vague about being too busy with an upcoming trip and the comment thread died. but it stuck with me because thats exactly the kind of engagement that builds real community and i fundamentally couldnt deliver it. another time someone asked her to collab with their small travel account and i had to ghost the dm. felt bad about that one.\n\nmonth eight, which was last month, i pivoted slightly. instead of trying to be an influencer account i repositioned as a travel tips and hacks page. less focus on the ai persona, more focus on useful information with the visuals just being illustration. engagement actually went up. made 340 dollars in affiliate revenue which still isnt life changing but the trajectory feels better.\n\ncurrent state: still running the accounts as a side project while job hunting. total investment was probably around 800 dollars in software subscriptions and some paid promotions that didnt really work. total revenue so far is just under 600 dollars so im still in the red but learning a lot.\n\nbiggest lessons from this whole thing. first, consistency of a virtual persona matters way more than i expected. even small variations in appearance made comments start asking if this was ai. second, the trust gap is real. people engage with ai generated content but converting that to purchases is harder than with real creators. third, the tools are genuinely impressive now but theyre not magic. you still need good ideas and execution.\n\nnot sure if ill keep going with this or try something completely different. the faceless content model works for some people but i think i underestimated how much parasocial connection drives creator economy businesses. without a real person to root for the ceiling might just be lower.",

      "text": "I analyze regulatory signals to track **\"Unfair Gaps\"** — specific operational points where businesses are legally or structurally forced to lose money. Most founders look for \"ideas\". I look for verified liabilities.\n\nHere are 3 validated gaps from today's analysis.\n\n**1. The \"Customs Bottleneck\" (International Trade)**\n\n* **Pain:** Lost operational capacity and throughput from manual HS classification holds.\n* **The Unfair Gap:** Opportunity cost equivalent to lost throughput. For large traders, misclassification-driven holds defer millions in goods from reaching markets, freezing capital on the water.\n* **Context:** Classification depends on a small pool of human experts. When they are unavailable or make an error, it triggers customs inspections that reduce the effective capacity of ports and transport assets.\n* **Opportunity:** Automated HS Classification API that interprets rulings and validates shipment manifests *before* they leave the warehouse.\n\n**2. The \"Rework Tax\" (Ambulance Services)**\n\n* **Pain:** Rework and rebilling costs due to incomplete claim data (missing modifiers/mileage).\n* **The Unfair Gap:** Rework costs $25–$50 per claim internally. For an agency with thousands of Medicare claims, this translates into six-figure annual losses in avoidable labor and delayed cash flow.\n* **Context:** Medicare manuals demand strict adherence to origin/destination modifiers and mileage lines. Field documentation is often inconsistent, and errors are currently caught only *after* the payer denies the claim.\n* **Opportunity:** A \"Pre-Submission Scrubber\" for CMS-1500 forms that validates specific ambulance modifiers against dispatch data.\n\n**3. The \"Recall Drag\" (Wholesale Alcohol)**\n\n* **Pain:** Delayed cash collection due to manual recall credits and reconciliations.\n* **The Unfair Gap:** Financing cost and working-capital drag equal to 1–3% of affected revenue annually. Wholesalers carry the cost of disputed balances while waiting for paper-based reconciliation.\n* **Context:** Recall data (lots, quantities) is trapped in spreadsheets and emails. Wholesalers must reconcile inventory across the three-tier chain (Supplier -> Wholesaler -> Retailer) before they can settle accounts, which takes weeks.\n* **Opportunity:** A centralized \"Recall Reconciliation Platform\" that automates credit issuance and regulatory reporting.\n\n**Summary** I have a database of 3,700+ of these. I plan to share the best ones here regularly. Let me know in the comments which industry you want me to scan next (Construction? Real Estate? Energy?).",

Its what happens when you want to bring a younger guys and you wanna push out the old dude. But he’s not one to let it get him down. He knows the industry really well. Tons of accolades from his former company. Recently been watching a YouTube channel called delivered. The guy live streams his car negotiations they do on behalf of customers. The basic concept of his businesses, customers pay him a flat fee to find and negotiate a car that they want on their behalf. I think my dad could essentially take that same concept and apply it to semi trucks. Basically as a consult. You could help guys or small Long just companies that need trucks to make sure that they’re not getting ripped off. We can take out the stress part of negotiating.",

I'm wondering how I would pay myself without “piercing the corporate veil” from my new LLC. \n\nI am planning to launch my business in early-to-mid February and am evaluating the best way to structure my owner compensation. I'm considering a profit-sharing model where I pay myself a set percentage (e.g., 10%) of the monthly net profit.\n\nI'm going to have a separate business bank account at a credit union that all my money from sales goes to.   \n  \nIs this a viable strategy compared to a fixed salary or hourly rate, and are there specific tax implications or 'red flags' I should be aware of when taking draws based on a percentage of profits?",

That does not pierce the corporate veil. Veil issues come from commingling funds, paying personal bills directly from the LLC, sloppy records, undercapitalization, and not treating the business like a separate entity.\n\nA “10% of monthly net profit” draw is fine as a cash management rule, but it does not change your tax bill. You are taxed on the LLC’s profit, whether you withdraw it or not. So the real key is to set aside money for quarterly estimated taxes and keep clean bookkeeping. In a multi-member LLC, profit splits and distributions should match the operating agreement (or be updated in writing).\n\nA fixed salary or hourly paycheck generally only applies if you elect S-corp taxation and run payroll. In that case, you must pay a reasonable salary and then take additional profits as distributions.\n\nRed flags to avoid: mixing accounts, personal expenses in the LLC, undocumented transfers, and taking distributions you cannot support with basis (common in partnerships and S-corps).\n\nBusinessAnywhere note: we see this a lot, and the clean separation and documentation matter more than the exact draw formula.",

Which products actually make money vs just take up space?\n2. Where is cash or effort leaking day to day?\n3. What should the owner focus on this month vs ignore for now?\n\nNot dashboards for the sake of it.... just clarity.\n\nWhat I’m actually talking about is as following....\n\nFor example, in a recent retail-style setup I worked on, the focus was simply:\n\n1. organising daily sales and stock data in one place (Excel / Sheets)\n2. identifying top-selling vs slow-moving items\n3. linking staff shifts to busy vs quiet periods\n4. ending with a 1-page action plan: what to stock less, what to push more, and what to stop doing\n5. No fancy software. No heavy tools. Just decisions made easier.\n\nHow I’m thinking of working (at least initially)\n\nunderstand how you currently track sales, inventory, staff, costs\n\nI go away, analyse, and come back with:\n\n2–3 clear insights\n\n2–3 concrete actions\n\ndone for free at first, to build real case studies and learn\n\nThis is not a big consultancy pitch nor I’m not pretending to scale this overnight.\n\nBefore I take this any further, I want honest feedback from people who actually run businesses:\n\n1. Would this kind of help be useful at all?\n2. Which part of your business feels the most “blind” right now.....inventory, margins, staffing, planning?\n3. Is this something you’d ever pay for if it saved time or money, or is it mostly a nice-to-have?\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing:\n\nwhat type of business you run (retail, food, services, etc.) or where decisions feel more like guesswork than clarity or even “this wouldn’t work” is a useful answer.\n\nThank you  \n",

          "text": "I think this is worth an experiment. I have worked as a bookkeeper (among many other things). The shocking truth I saw several times is that some people who ran a business were severely disinterested in the business side; no passion for cash flow, budgeting, bookkeeping, or future planning. Often they don't know anything about business writing, marketing principles (that's the one I'm thrilled about), and only dealt with legal awareness once a problem arose. So treat it like an experiment and prepare to go for bigger small clients/firms to make your life easier.\n\nSo 3 things come to mind:\n\n1. clients that need help the most can't afford it or think they can't, they need help so badly that they have no clue that your service would help. Then each lead turns into a major selling process and requires high involvement per customer acquisition (just my experience with running small agencies) - see #3\n2. they won't easily adopt any better practices, they'll instead tick the box for one of the popular buzz words, analytics or data, and revert easily to old habits\n3. it's really hard to build a practice that serves super-small and inexperienced business operators that appear to need your help the most, even if you focus on one niche. Bigger small businesses recognize the value of analysis. Small-timers don't even know that's a thing, so you'd have to motivate them to listen, and take them through a few stages of initial change so that they'd see a brighter future and connect you to it mentally. Whew, so much work.\n\nThat was my mistake - I should've planned my bookkeeping towards motivated value-aware clients that are initially harder to get.",

Would this be something like a one-time service where you analize different aspects of a business and give clear feedback for a cartain price? Or would this be your permanent job with monthly salary? Lastly, how much would this type of help cost? Oh and just to clarify - 1. I dont own any type of business as of right now, 2.

          "text": "Small business advisor here, sharing a few thoughts - definitely a need, likely an opportunity, some obstacles to overcome.\n\nFirst, work out what you mean by “Small business”. When people tell me that’s their niche, I always follow up with “How do you define a small business?” and the answers vary wildly.\n\nTo me a small business is maybe 4-12 employees; I’ve seen definitions that go up to $50 million in annual revenue! And some people talk about solopreneurs as SMEs.\n\nThis is important for a few reasons. You want to know who you’re chasing for work, and make it easy for anyone who might refer you clients. I’ve learned from trial and error that my best clients are 12-48 employees - the vast majority of website enquiries and referrals I’ve received have been much smaller, where I’m often too expensive, making it a waste of time for everyone.\n\nMy other observation is that - outside of digital-native businesses like ecommerce - **most small businesses have very little data**.\n\nI would love, for example, to have an AI version of myself that could make a digital twin of the business and provide constant observations and suggestions. But most of my clients have an accounting platform, bits of disconnected marketing data, maybe some sales or workflow spreadsheets (I’ve often helped them build), and a LOT of stuff in people’s heads and guts.\n\nWorth noting at this point that I don’t work with retail or hospitality - and I guess those are two sectors with good POS data you could use? I avoid them because they’re B2C with low margins, and often too cheap to pay even for good advice.\n\nThe bigger the business, the more software, the more systems, the more consistent and accessible the data. So that’s perhaps your biggest challenge - what are the types and size of businesses that you want to work with, where you can actually help?\n\n**What would my clients pay for (and how much?)**\n\nThere’s definitely money to be made. I helped a law firm get clear on individual billing data - who was producing what, and how could people see that information sooner. That part of a wider project was around $25,000.\n\nI have a few trade / home services businesses that struggle to see daily revenue data - especially in advance. They have scheduling software, usually prices are recorded in their, but there’s no button that says “Next Wednesday you’ll do $20,000 but your target is $30,000”. Getting that data in arrears is unhelpful - give it to them early and you can charge.\n\nMarketing and sales is the other big one. Marketing agencies (and managers) love to report on “conversions”, by which they mean “converted into a lead”. Small business owners don’t care about “lead conversions” they want “converted into a paying client” - and yet showing that data, from enquiry to lead to sale to lifetime value - is surprisingly difficult for most SMEs. Being so close to the money, this is valuable and solutions can charge a lot.\n\nJust sticking with the data, I think you’ll be able to charge either a few thousand up front and/or a few hundred a month ongoing.\n\nIf you can also provide solutions and help execute the change, then clients will be worth tens of thousands per year.\n\nUnless you really do start chasing much larger businesses with solid consulting solutions. That’s now above my area of expertise, but many contracts there start in the hundreds of thousands!\n\nGood luck.",

Right now I’m leaning towards businesses that are *past survival mode* but not structured enough to justify a full-time analyst....probably owner-led teams with some software in place, but messy or disconnected data.\n\nI’m also very aware of the data problem you mentioned. A lot of this is intuition, gut feel, and partial systems. That’s actually why I’m trying to start with very narrow, decision-led use cases (like revenue visibility, customer mix, or near-term planning) rather than broad 'analytics'.\n\nAt this stage, I’m intentionally doing a few focused pilots to learn where real value shows up, document outcomes, and avoid building something generic too early. Long-term, I agree...anything close to cash flow or sales-to-value tracking is where owners will actually pay.\n\nReally appreciate you sharing concrete examples.... this gives me a much clearer frame to navigate this properly.\n\nBut finding and reaching out to potential customers still remains a main hurdle I would say!",

Now i have enough land suitable for either of these crops but i dont have capital to run the production. \nI am appealing to you, looking for someone who is interested in that business so that we can join into partnership.

Pick your state Most people should form in the state where they actually live or do business. Forming in Delaware/Wyoming only makes sense in specific situations, otherwise you may end up paying extra to register in your home state anyway.\n2. Choose an LLC name Check your state’s business name database to make sure it’s available and follows the naming rules (usually requires “LLC” or “L.L.C.”).\n3. Choose a registered agent This person/company receives legal and state mail for your LLC. In many states you can be your own registered agent if you have a reliable in-state address and can be available during business hours.\n4. File the Articles of Organization This is the official formation filing with your state. You’ll pay the state filing fee (varies by state).\n5. Create an Operating Agreement Even if your state doesn’t require it, you should have one. It helps show the LLC is separate from you, and it’s essential if you have multiple owners.\n6. Get an EIN from the IRS It’s free and you’ll usually need it to open a business bank account, handle taxes, and hire contractors.\n7. Open a business bank account and keep things separate Separate banking and clean bookkeeping matter if you want the liability protection to actually hold up.\n8. Stay compliant Annual reports, state fees, licenses (if needed), and any tax registrations your business requires.\n\nDo you need a lawyer?  \nUsually not for a simple single-member LLC. You might want one if you have partners, want custom ownership/profit splits, are raising money, or have higher liability.\n\nIf you want a step-by-step walkthrough, here’s a good starter guide: [How to Start an LLC](https://businessanywhere.io/business-registration/).",

We’re based 45mins north of NYC. \n\nOur overheads are minimal so I’m fortunate enough to have a solid platform from which to launch a business. \n\nMy professional background is making TV shows. I’m a Director of Photography (camera guy). My wife is a Producer/Director. I own a bunch of camera kit that’s all been paid off. Zero debt.\n\nAs well as making TV shows, my wife and I run a small production agency making corporate videos. I’ve also started a photography business doing family photography in my local area.\n\nI’d like to start another business to supplement the aforementioned revenue streams. It doesn’t necessarily have to be connected to TV/Production. \n\nGiven I live in a recession proof high net worth area (My neighbours are Wall Street millionaires, the country club class) what type of business would you start? \n\nIn terms of local networks, my FIL is a well established local architect so maybe there’s a route there? \n\nOpen to any suggestions and inspiration. \n\nTIA.",

Along with having high activity multiplayer games like valorant and csgo which tend to get a lot of footfall in the gaming cafes, how bout we add games to make it a chill, laid back single player gaming experience too.\n\nThe multiplayer games like valorant and csgo will be played locally on high end pcs in the cafe but games like split fiction, it takes two, a day out, Chained together, r v there yet, peak, God of war, last of us series, cyberpunk 2077, elden ring Will be played on cloud pcs.\n\nThis can serve as a hangout spot for couples who just want to enjoy co-op games together and to have fun and also a fun activity for a group of friends who want to chill and play these trending co-op games.\n\nThis will be a low cost alternative for consumers to owning even a decent pc and a good wifi connection as we will primarily focus on tier 2 & tier 3 cities and hence we will be keeping our prices economical.\n\nThe initial capital investment in this business is going to be relatively low as compared to doing all the things locally and buying expensive hardware.\n\nHad just this random idea this morning.\n\nDo let me know your thoughts on the same and if you're interested to build this together you can also dm me.\n\nTIA",

So your market is actually targeting people who are avid gamers but don't have infra. Casual gamers won't pay much to meet RoI. This becomes a very small market. \n\nGaming cafes used to be a thing in 2010s but have gone out of flavor for a reason.",

Marketing takes viral reels or videos to properly sell organically. Even that takes proper optimization of SEO.\n\nTo your restaurant, SEO is your product quality, packaging, and loyalty. \n\nSo do you have all those qualities?\n\nDo you love your product? Enough to speak from the heart and give a personal experience while pitching? Is your post well packaged and curated or spam level AI garbage? And are your customers loyal to you?",

Followers and emails don’t matter if they aren’t coming in with a specific pain the affiliate actually solves. I’d narrow to one problem, one audience, one offer, and test hard instead of spreading effort across platforms. No sales is just data, it tells you what to change next.",

Just make sure each niche ties to a real buying trigger, not just content engagement. Likes don’t equal intent. Test one angle long enough to see if people click, reply, or ask for help. That feedback matters more than follower growth.",
