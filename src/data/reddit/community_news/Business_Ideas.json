Its just manual trial and error and I use a json as the profile template. My problem is I feel its too jankey to sell but I deal with the jankey stuff because I can spend an hour and get a profile dialed in and save it and it works 90% of the time and im able to get the money info and dates into a database that can export csv or whatever for a book keeper. I developed it because I have adhd and I cant stay organized with paperwork everywhere so its way easier to keep a folder on the PC with each month of records and then get it all into a data base and its all there basically. Ive automated a huge chunk of the repeating tasks basically all I gotta do is take pictures of receipts with a scanner app and then transfer them into the folder when im home. And boom I can process the receipts and bank accounts in under an hour. And hell im usually screwing around on my phone for most of the hour so a normal person it would probably be 30 mins lol 😆",

I’ve been doing a ton of research, but I keep going back and forth on whether I need to form an LLC or if I can just start selling as a sole proprietor.  \n  \nHere’s the thing, I’m not planning to quit my day job anytime soon, and I’m starting super small. Like, maybe $500 in sales a month if I’m lucky. But I’ve heard horror stories about people getting sued or having their personal assets at risk because they didn’t have an LLC. On the other hand, I don’t want to overcomplicate things or spend money on legal fees if it’s not necessary right now.  \n  \nMy cousin started selling vintage clothes on Etsy a few years ago and never bothered with an LLC. She was doing pretty well until someone claimed they got a rash from one of her sweaters (turned out they were just allergic to wool, but still). She ended up settling out of court, and it was a huge headache. Now she swears by her LLC, but I’m not sure if her situation applies to me.  \n  \nSo, do I need an LLC from the start, or can I wait until I’m making more money? For those of you who sell online, did you start with an LLC or wait until later? Any advice would be super appreciated.",

It's simple, and free, but make sure to report the income on your regular taxes. \n\nThe reason you'd want to open an LLC, is to have limited liability. If someone sues your business, an LLC helps keep your personal assets (like your car, savings, etc.) separate from the business. That’s what your cousin’s situation was really about.\n\nSince it's a small business, and you're selling handmade pens specifically, your risk is relatively low, and I would definitely recommend starting as sole proprietor. If later on you decide to go full in, it might be a good idea to open an LLC once you’re making steady money or scaling up.\n\nPS.

This normally happens when the corp is closely held by one or a small number of owners and said owner(s) are directly involved.\n\nSecond is they can always sue you personally even if you are just an employee. \n\nA lot of advice to small and/or new business way overhype the protection you get from an LLC.   If they sue they will go after your personal assets and nothing will stop that if you are a solo owner working in the business.  Any lawyer worth his salt will at least sue the owner in addition to the business.  \n\nLoads of reasons to have an LLC but the \"limited liability\" part needs to be framed correctly.\n\nMost small and especially new businesses have no reason to be LLCs when they are basically a relatively low paid job for the owner/worker.  \n\nOnce you get bigger, have employees, and/or have tax or other reasons to then get an LLC or other corp.",

It just changes what’s typically at risk.\n* If you mix funds, skip basic paperwork, or personally cause harm (negligence), the “shield” can be weaker.\n\nFor handmade pens, the bigger early risks are usually practical, not legal structure:\n\n* Sales tax and permits: you may need a sales tax permit and to collect/remit sales tax depending on where you sell and where buyers are.\n* Local business license and a DBA/fictitious name filing if you sell under a shop name.\n* Product liability: consider simple product liability insurance once you’re shipping regularly, especially if you use finishes, adhesives, or include small parts.\n\nA common path (and what we see at BusinessAnywhere) is:  \nStart as a sole proprietor with a separate bank account and clean records, then form an LLC once sales are consistent, you’re taking larger orders, or you’re worried about personal asset exposure.",

Check how long they've been on the platform and look for reviews from buyers in your region. Ask for references from other customers. Trade Assurance or similar payment protection is worth the fees for first orders.

      "text": "1.)  I live in a suburb of Chicago.  Weather is terrible, all our cars look terrible most of the time but I still like to get my car washed regularly.  Other unrelated fact: shopping centers are suffering.  I live near Oak Brook mall and I would LOVE if a car wash service posted up in one of the parking garages.  It feels archaic to have to go to some random car wash and just sit there and wait.  I understand this probably does take place in certain areas of the US but not near me!  I know there are also mobile car washes but not near me...especially in the winter.  I would love to either be home or able to run a few errands such as at a mall while my car was getting washed.  I know at some large corporate buildings they offer this in their parking garages but people are working onsite less so I could see a need for this.  Plus, I would think the shopping malls would cut a deal on the real estate required because it would bring in more traffic.  I would happily go to the mall and walk around (probably end up buying something) if this existed.  Thoughts?\n\n2.)  I think there should be some type of app where people can anonymously upload their budget spreadsheets.  You'd also need to fill in your annual household income.  I think it would be incredibly helpful to look at other people's budgets that have a similar household income as me.  My husband and I argue about what our annual budget should be.  We have SO much in savings (a lot a lot) and he constantly thinks we should be saving more.  I think let's enjoy life a little more.  Quick background, when he grew up his house was foreclosed on so I think he operates from a place of fear and saving brings him SUCH comfort.  So we have done a good job at that for a long time but, at a certain point, at what cost?  I think it would be helpful to compare and understand spending statistics of other similar families.  I also think people that are poor with savings could really learn from how other families do it.  Thoughts?",

Winter adds freezing issues.\n* The simplest v1 is not a full tunnel wash — it’s **eco/low-water detailing** (rinseless wash + interior) with booked slots, done by crews in a dedicated section of the garage.\n* If you can get one mall to say yes, it’s a strong wedge: malls want **foot traffic + revenue share**. You’d pitch it like a pop-up service.\n\n\n\n\n\n**2) Anonymous budget spreadsheet sharing by income**\n\n\n\n* The “I want to see how similar households spend” is a *real* need (and couples will use it).\n* Hard parts: people won’t upload raw sheets unless you nail **privacy + anonymization**, and you need enough volume to be useful.\n* A better MVP: users paste numbers into categories (housing, food, travel, childcare, etc.) and you show **percentiles by income + location + family size**. No raw spreadsheets.\n* Monetization could be optional: “compare vs peers” + “couples budget alignment” tools, but you’d need trust first.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I had to pick: **#1 is a clean local business with fast validation** (go talk to mall management + run a weekend pilot). **#2 is a longer-term product** that needs careful privacy design + data density.",

I wanted to know if you guys think this would be a good idea, and business model, perhaps teachers getting a commission off courses they submit (and are used).",

A shared creative space solves a real problem for musicians who do not have access to gear, space, or a community to collaborate with.\n\nThe biggest thing I would think about early is usage patterns. Gyms work because people come regularly and equipment scales well. Music spaces tend to be more bursty. Someone might come a lot for a few weeks and then disappear. That does not kill the idea, but it affects how memberships should be structured and priced.\n\nNoise control, scheduling, and wear on equipment are also real operational challenges. You would probably want very clear time slots, booking rules, and accountability so it does not turn into chaos or burnout for whoever is running it.\n\nWhere this really shines is community. If people feel like they belong there and not just rent a room, retention becomes much easier. Group jams, beginner friendly sessions, and hosted events could matter more than the gear itself.\n\nOverall it feels viable if started small and local, almost like a pilot space. If you can prove people show up consistently and bring friends, that is when the membership model really starts to make sense.",

People are gross, and dumb, and break things. You would need a lot of supervision and staffing. Once you get to a point to where it makes sense conceptually its basically just the existing private studio model. \n\nThe only thing similar that works would be something like Vera Project in Seattle - a community based art venue that runs on a non profit model, passionate volunteers, grants, etc. Alternately, bands tend to rent practice space in industrial areas that are inexpensive.",

Most onboarding tools focus on storing information, not on the cognitive load of remembering what happens next and who needs attention.\n\nAs a manager, the biggest relief here is only being notified when something actually needs intervention. That alone removes a lot of background stress. As an employee, having a clear sequence instead of guessing what is expected next would reduce anxiety, especially after the first week when support usually drops off.\n\nOne thing to watch is flexibility. Onboarding often changes based on role, pace, or context, so allowing lightweight adjustments without rebuilding flows will matter.

The devil called and I accepted, that is, the SBA called and offered me a loan during Covid that crippled me and now, bankruptcy seems to be the only way out.\n\nHowever, I don’t want to do that.\n\nMonthly payments — $4,000\n\nStill have around $150K\n\nThe business LLC is still in operation but only generates roughly $700 gross monthly.\n\nI have a w2 job making $130K/annually.\n\nNo payments have ever been late or missed.\n\nI was one of the first to market in my state for search engine marketing I had many good years, but competition became fierce. Meanwhile, I never figured out how to scale. I’m creative, great with clients, and get results, but definitely lack business acumen in certain areas.  The main purpose was to have the time to raise my daughters. Also, severe depression/anxiety happened in 21, and I lost a lot of momentum (and clients).\n\nIn terms of scaling, I can’t in good conscience spend a cent more of this money to market my failing LLC.\n\nI’m working on finding a couple of second jobs as a commission-only sales rep for other marketing agencies to bring in some extra cash.\n\nMy questions are: How could I put some of the money that remains to use in a smart way so that it grows? High-yield savings is the obvious choice, but curious if anyone has any other ideas?",

One idea that might be worth exploring before throwing more money at the LLC is separating the cashflow problem from the debt problem, because they’re actually two different challenges.\nOn the cashflow side, look for predictable, demand-based income, even if it isn’t sexy. Things like small service businesses with recurring demand (cleaning, detail/maintenance, local contract work) often convert time directly into revenue, which helps with meeting payments without bleeding savings.\nOn the debt side, there are sometimes ways to restructure or refinance an SBA loan that keeps you current without as much immediate pressure — many people don’t realize that negotiation often gets better terms without bankruptcy if you go to the lender with a clear plan rather than silence.\nI know that sounds like a lot, but separating the income problem from the loan problem helped me think clearly when I was balancing income swings. It also helps you pick opportunities that actually pay bills instead of just looking “good on paper.”",

It reads like someone who made a hard decision during an abnormal time, kept their commitments, and is now carrying a heavy load because of it.\n\nYou already did something important by stabilising with a W2 income and keeping payments current. That matters more than most people here will admit. At this stage, growth might actually be the wrong goal. Preserving flexibility and reducing mental pressure is probably the priority.\n\nIf the LLC is no longer viable, it is not a failure to stop feeding it. You can separate your identity and skills from that entity. Your experience still exists even if the structure does not. Sometimes the smartest move is containment rather than recovery.\n\nI do not have a magic answer, but I do think you are asking the right questions. This feels less like a money problem and more like a pressure management problem. Reducing decision fatigue and protecting your future options may be worth more than chasing returns right now.",

      "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm from Satna, Madhya Pradesh. If you know the area, you know it's basically the cement capital of the country (Prism, UltraTech, MP Birla, etc. are all right here).\n\nI’ve been looking at getting into the supply side. Coal is the obvious one, but the capital requirement is insane and the \"old money\" has that on lock.\n\nI’ve been looking into Bhusi )AFR)—Rice, Wheat, and Mustard husk. These plants are desperate for green fuel right now to replace coal, and I’ve got a 3,000 sq ft godown in Tikuriya (close proximity from the factories) ready to go.\n\nThe guy who runs the Test House (the one that does the actual quality audits for these plants) is a close contact. He's willing to help me verify quality before anything even hits the plant gate. In this business, if your moisture or ash content is off by 2%, they reject your whole truck. Having \"eyes\" inside the lab is a huge deal.\n\n**What I’m looking for:**\n\n1. Does anyone here move biomass at scale? Is bhusi the right play or should I look at something else (minerals/limestone/logistics)?\n2. Are there any exporters or big sourcing guys who need a boots-on-the-ground partner here? I can handle the physical verification, storage, and local \"fixing.\"\n3. If anyone wants to partner up or has a contract but no local guy they can trust to check the loading, let's talk.\n\nI'm not some agency in Delhi. I'm actually here on the ground. Curious to see what you guys think is the best way to leverage this.",
