          "text": "You are missing a key part of Costco’s model: \nThey turnover product in under 30 days. Sometimes twice in 30 days depending on the product. They turnover their entire store in 30 days. Given that most terms for buying product are net30, the companies that are selling Costco products to sell, are effectively financing them. \n\nCostco has a ridiculously low sku count so people generally have one choice, not two. They work with their partners to get some advantage for their members. If the price of cocoa goes up, they go to their mfg and allow them to raise the price to cover that increase. But when the cost of cocoa goes down, you better believe they are making sure the mfg is lowering the price again. It goes both ways. They are partners. \n\nWith the categories you are describing, you can’t get what has made Costco work. For virtually every category you mentioned, people want choice. And with choice, there’s no volume. Costco buys in palettes. Your categories are one off purchases with considerable time in between purchases. \n\nIf you are thinking partners like the Costco auto program, I don’t think the clientele you want are bargain shopping and looking for ways to save money on houses, cars, vacations. If you are talking about a concierge service that will navigate these things for people, I pretty sure it already exists. \n\nJust my $.02",

If I spend $2k/year I’m not dropping $1k (or $10k) on a membership.\n\nSecond you’re not going to do any better than Costco’s volume and subsequent wholesale purchase cost - they operate internationally and have a huge amount of leverage and operational efficiencies. So at absolute best you’d be trading 1:1 discounts on goods for the income you’re bringing in from memberships.\n\nThree because you’re not going to be able to get the wholesale pricing that Costco gets because you won’t be able to bring that purchase volume you’d immediately be at a disadvantage against Costco, Sam’s, and BJs.\n\nFour presumptively most people who are spending enough at Costco where dropping $10k up front would even remotely justify their purchasing would be smart enough to do the overall math and see you’re not beating Costco’s total price year over year whatsoever because it would be impossible to do so unless you have a near unlimited budget to start your chain with.\n\nMaybe you could do a premium club experience where they sell Balenciaga and 55 gallon drums of Caviar.\n\nPS Costco has a hand in a bunch of that anyway - for example, Costco sells everything from insurance to moving services to credit card processing to cars (you actually get a discount but whatever.)",

You’d can’t gut margins on products by charging a membership fee - anyone that isn’t a complete idiot would figure it out.\n\nThe reason Costco can do it is they have the buying power and operational efficiencies as such that they have already taken their wholesale costs down to the wire (most of the time) before a customer has ever paid their nominal membership fee.\n\nUnless you yourself are Costco you’d be getting terrible wholesale pricing first because your volume would be peanuts and then trying to justify the artificially low pricing you advertise by charging artificially high membership fees.\n\nYou’ll also note in the areas that you suggest that Costco already operates in they don’t even do those in-house - they negotiate a discount for members with outside companies due to the volume of customers they’re sending them. So their overhead in most cases is approximately nothing, it’s just a bonus stream of revenue leveraging their existing customer base.\n\nIf we were speaking in hypotheticals maybe but the whole purpose of Costco is to attract bargain hunters which if you're going upmarket is exactly the market least likely to find bargain hunting appealing.\n\nThat's my personal opinion anyway.\n\n It's kind of like asking why there isn't a high end Walmart. its a contradiction.\n\nAlso final point - Costco is built around consumables so there’s a constant need for the membership. How often does someone buy a house, a car, a motorcycle, go to college?\n\nNow that I think about it you’re kind of proposing an internalized AARP or AAA.",

      "text": "I used to believe the hardest part of building a startup was coming up with a completely original idea. Every new concept felt exciting at first, but most of them fell apart once I tried to imagine real customers paying for them.\n\nRecently, while browsing StartupIdeas DB (i came across it on google) I noticed something interesting. Many of the most compelling businesses weren’t novel at all. They were existing ideas executed better, adapted to a new niche, or brought to a different market. In hindsight, this pattern shows up everywhere once you start looking for it.\n\nCopying gets a bad reputation, but most successful startups are really just proven businesses with a twist. Sometimes the twist is better UX, sometimes pricing, sometimes distribution, and sometimes geography. Very few are truly “from scratch” innovations.\n\nBuilding something completely new often means educating customers, validating demand the hard way, and making expensive mistakes no one else has made yet. Copying a business that already works shifts the challenge from “will this idea work?” to “can I execute better or differently?”, which feels like a much more solvable problem.\n\nI’m curious how others here think about this. Have you had more success innovating versus adapting? Where do you draw the line between copying and learning? And do you have examples of unoriginal ideas that worked surprisingly well for you?",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nHope 2026 has started well for you.\n\nI’m currently building DIFM (Do It For Me), a London-first managed home services platform. The product build is already underway with a CTO, and I’m now narrowing in on a number of strong candidates for a GTM / Ops co-founder role.\n\nI’ve spent the last 15 years working hands-on in property maintenance and residential environments in London. I’m building DIFM because this category is massive but structurally broken. Pricing is unclear, fulfilment is unreliable, and customers are left in the dark when something goes wrong. Most platforms fail not because of demand, but because the operating model collapses once real jobs start happening.\n\nWe’re now close to MVP and entering that pre-launch phase where a lot of important but unglamorous work needs doing. This is the kind of work that gives you a real understanding of how startups are actually built. Not theory, not courses, not buzzwords, but real execution and decision-making under constraints.\n\nI’m looking for one switched-on person who wants to work closely with me during this phase.\n\nTo be clear on expectations from the start: this is not a formal job posting and not a corporate role. The commitment is light, flexible, and fully async, designed around existing commitments. It is initially unpaid as we’re pre-revenue and bootstrapped. If it becomes genuinely valuable on both sides, there’s room to formalise things later, either as a paid role once revenue or funding exists, or through equity only if someone ends up taking real, ongoing ownership.\n\nI’m deliberately not listing a rigid set of tasks. Different people bring different strengths. Some are strong at research, some at outreach, some at organisation, some at spotting problems early. I’d rather understand what you’re capable of than force a title on it.\n\nThis probably isn’t a fit if you’re looking for something polished, guaranteed, or highly structured. It is a fit if you’re curious how real businesses are built from the inside and want exposure to actual decisions while something real is going live.\n\nIf this resonates, send me a DM with a short intro, what you’re currently doing, what you’re good at or interested in working on, and a LinkedIn profile or CV.\n\nNo formal process, just a straightforward conversation.\n\nRegardless of whether this is for you or not, wishing everyone a great year ahead!\n\nEddie",

In person, we go to many businesses repeatedly because our “Guy” is there.\n\nThe reason why you may choose this franchised restaurant over its sister locations despite it being further.\n\nThe reason why you’ll sigh and pay extra when your barber’s price goes up, while others don’t.\n\nThe reason why you'll wait in line for your regular bartender is that the other bartenders may have shorter lines and be working from the same stock.\n\nIt’s almost irrational when it’s written down, it all stems from the same reasoning. You trust that your guy gets you and will never steer you wrong.\n\nBecause they’re your “Guy”.\n\nOne thing I see with clients a lot is that they don’t try to position themselves this way.\n\nThey focus on listing services, credentials, packages, or features, but they never answer an unspoken question customers actually care about: “Is this the person I want to keep coming back to?”\n\nBeing someone’s guy isn’t just about being the most pristine or posting nonstop. It’s about showing people that human aspect. That excellent customer service shows that you get them.\n\nWhen customers feel that, loyalty happens naturally. Referrals happen naturally. Price sensitivity drops without you ever having to force it.\n\nThey may even just offer you more money because they value… their “Guy”.\n\nIf you’re a business owner or service provider, I honestly think this is one of the most underrated levers there is.\n\nIt is simply just becoming the person people trust enough to stop looking elsewhere.\n\nBecome their “Guy”.\n\nCurious if others have noticed this too, either as a customer or as a business owner?",

Stuff like “no surprises on price” or “I’ll tell you if this isn’t right for you.”\n\n\n\nYou can even design this into the business: same point of contact, regular check‑ins, pattern‑spotting (“last time you liked X, so I thought of Y”), and a simple way to share wins with their team so they look good internally. That’s where tools like HubSpot, Notion, or even equity platforms like Cake Equity turn into quiet loyalty engines, because they help you consistently show up as the same reliable human every time.\n\n\n\nIf you build around being their person, not just their vendor, you stop competing on a feature list.",

For eg. the first payment is an upfront payment, a small one, like 30-50€. I settled it because I don’t want to waste my time with people who wants to make 10k in the first week and then leave my team because “they don’t have time” to work anymore.\nAfter the payment is done I’m working with the people and I’m teaching them the first part (content creation); then for the next part - another payment, another teaching session (social media marketing) and so on. \nThere are 4 parts. \nSo I’m not asking for a full upfront payment because I cannot provide any guarantee for what I’m speaking. \nOf course that I can provide screenshots from my Fanvue account or from my private messages with my team members.\n*Real guarantees, not screenshots with $ in my Fanvue account. - those are nonsense because can be manipulated.\n\nThe point is: I got tired of those gurus who are pretending to make hundreds of thousands of$ monthly and they are selling course for 50-100$, one time price, and scam naive people.\nThose courses don’t have any useful information, I know what I’m talking because I have in my team guys who bought some courses before from those gurus. \n\nSo your platform will be very useful!",

Everything I read says Delaware is the gold standard (Court of Chancery, VC friendly), but I’m getting wildly different advice on how to actually form the thing.\n\nMy cousin (who is a paralegal, not a corporate lawyer) is scaring me saying that if I don't have a lawyer draft the Operating Agreement, the online templates will leave me wide open for personal liability if I ever get sued. She mentioned something about piercing the corporate veil and how most of these online services don't actually handle the foreign qualification if I'm not living in DE (I’m based in Austin, TX).\n\nWhat's a cheap and fast way to form an LLC in Delaware for a project that's started generating some monthly income? I'm looking for legit options that won't hit me with unnecessary upsells or hourly charges. Any advice on how to handle this efficiently? I need a solution to complete the set up online. \n\nLawyer quoted me $2,500 for a \"startup package.\" This feels like a massive chunk of my bootstrap budget just for some paperwork.\n\nFor those who used an online service, did it ever come back to bite you when you tried to raise money or open a bank account? Has anyone actually had a \"standard\" Operating Agreement fail them in a legal dispute?  \n  \nI really don't want to spend $2k+ if I don't have to, but I also don't want to save $1,500 now only to lose the whole company later because of a typo in a template.  \n",

For what it's worth, I ended up going with Northwest Registered Agent and have had a great experience so far. They scan all the legal and state mail into my account. I am actually about to upgrade to the premium mail package so I can just have all my mail sent there and uploaded to my account. They will actually even shred the junk mail, too. Super easy to work with, great support and they are all about privacy. \n\nDef give them a look. It's been well worth it for us and we are continuing to add other services of theirs as we grow.",

The setup is basically a building with 4-6 theaters that would resemble what a wealthy person would have in their home. High end furniture, really nice projector/screen, etc. Charging $50/person for 4-12 seat theaters plus food and beverage. \n\nCurious if anyone has experience with something like this either from the customer perspective or business side. Any idea how much it costs a theatre to show first run movies?",

EMS in my area and as a whole is burning out medics through predatory QA departments and I have a program that teaches how to approach QA to improve providers not make them fear QA and leave the profession. This business would cover implementation of the new QA program, staff training, personal attendance to 3 QAQI meetings, data and analytics training. I would then be on a retainer for large sentinel events and other consulting needs. My research has shown this as a pretty untapped niche and pricing goals would be 20k for start up training and implementation followed by a 4k per month retainer that would scale up and down depending on department size and need. I believe this could easily hit 7 figures within two years. Any advice is appreciated thank you.",

          "text": "Hey guys,\n\nSo I have been working on a side project that would help people when it comes to their mental health. It's a tool designed to provide people with the means of dealing with whatever mental struggles they're experiencing in a private and safe way. The tool is called Haven.\n\nHaven is an AI desktop companion that uses the Ollama LLM model to remain private and localized in your computer. It is completely local and offline. There are no external API's or services that are connected to the internet. It's essentially a chat box that is completely black boxed. Haven will respond to your texts in real time and remember several contextual information you provide it but will forget everything as soon as you close it. It's also designed to begin forgetting the conversation as the conversation continues.\n\nIn short, nothing you write ever leaves your computer. It's simply just you, your thoughts, and Haven. There's no way for me to even see how Haven is being used except through a feedback box that is embedded in the Haven application. Again, Haven is completely free and I intend to keep it free forever. If you're curious and want to use Haven, you can download it from my website here: [https://prometheussys.com](https://prometheussys.com/)\n\nIf you do end up installing it, I would very much appreciate if you can provide me with feedback on Haven. The goal is to improve this companion so that it can better address people's mental health struggles. It is also important to note that Haven was never designed to replace an actual professional but to be a tool in a person's toolbox when it comes to dealing with mental health struggles.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and thank you in advance for considering Haven.",

I’ve been thinking about returning to work though, and thought how cool would it be to be my own boss? Especially if something small and flexible, and especially if it’s somewhere I could also bring our little one to.\n\nWe have a co-ed building in town. It’s an old factory split into suites that are rented out to small businesses and it gets a ton of traffic. I poked around the other day and found out the rent for a suite is $240 a month, which isn’t bad!\n\nWe also have only one consignment/thrift shop in our town. They carry anything and everything, and are relatively expensive.\n\nI’d love to provide a place that is affordable, cute, and brings a fun experience to families, whether they want to shop together, or let their kid color and have fun while they look around. I also love the idea of selling used items, as it’s so much more approachable and environmentally friendly.\n\nI’m thinking of starting with a $5,000 capital, which should be more than enough, right?\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI’m exploring the idea of starting a small homemade chocolate business and would really appreciate some feedback from this community.\n\nThe concept is inspired by the rising appeal of Dubai-style chocolates, known for rich flavors, premium presentation, and unique ingredients like pistachio, dates, saffron, cardamom, and filled chocolate bars with Middle Eastern twists. I’m planning to start small from home, focusing on handcrafted quality rather than mass production.\n\nTo manage startup costs, I’m considering sourcing packaging, molds, and basic equipment from Alibaba, while keeping ingredients fresh and locally sourced. Alongside this, I think building a strong online presence early will be key. My plan is to use Instagram, TikTok, and possibly a simple website to showcase the chocolate-making process, highlight the Dubai-inspired theme, take small orders, and test demand before scaling.\n\nInitially, I’d offer a limited range of products like bars, truffles, and filled chocolates, reinvesting profits as the brand grows.\n\nI’d love advice on whether the homemade chocolate market is too saturated and if Dubai-themed branding actually helps stand out.\n\n I’d also appreciate tips on setting up an online presence early and pricing a small but premium-style chocolate brand.",

Of course it depends where you are and what are your shipping costs. Of course I was only looking at reselling existing one so making it yourself is potentially increasing your margins. \n\nHowever, again depending on your jurisdiction, food production is usually heavily regulated. You need to have separate place or at least separate room and you need to have your stuff checked. \n\nThen there is logistics. In hot climate chocolates can start to melt. \n\nSo in my humble opinion you would need to make a premium product and sell it with significant margin to make it work. \n\n> if Dubai-themed branding actually helps stand out.\n\nDefinitely not. There is dubai chocolate everything. I've seen ice tea, perfumes and even [shower gels](https://webshop.afroditacosmetics.com/int/dubai-chocolate-shower-gel).

Doing gig's on the other hand with like task rabbit etc is a way to almost bring in immediate income due to having a potential customer base there. Over the long term, you will take less though and don't essentially have a business, just an income which can be fine too. \n\nHowever, if building a business is more important, then you can absolutely start small and build something meaningful. Your capital is minimal, but so many service based businesses can be started with little capital, and lots of sweat equity. Like you mentioned, snow shovelling etc could work, it's seasonal however so finding services that align with this, but serve during the warmer months would be ideal. \n\nI would take a minute to write some things down that may interest you and look for ways that you could pursue that. You don't have to have a passion for what you do or love it, just a curiosity can often be enough. It could be pet grooming, dog walking, lawn care, personal training, aquarium tank cleaning, residential/ office cleaning, junk removal, meal prep....the list goes on. \n\nYou want to find a service that could be naturally recurring i.e. weekly cleaning, monthly car detailing etc.",

      "text": "I’ve been thinking a lot about starting my own business. It’s something I genuinely want, not just a random idea or a phase. I like the idea of building something for myself, making my own decisions, and not always feeling like I’m working on someone else’s dream.\n\nAt the same time, I keep getting stuck in my own head. I have doubts about doing it alone. Not about the work itself, but about trusting myself enough to make the right calls, handle setbacks, and not freeze when things get hard. Some days I feel confident and motivated, other days I’m questioning if I’m even cut out for it or if I’m just romanticizing the idea.\n\nWhat messes with me is that I don’t know if this lack of confidence is just a normal part of the process or a sign that I’m not ready yet. I keep wondering if confidence is something you’re supposed to already have before starting, or if it’s something that only shows up once you’re actually in it.\n\nI guess I’m curious if anyone else has felt this way before starting their own thing. Did you push through the doubt, wait until you felt “ready,” or realize you needed a partner or some kind of safety net? Just trying to figure out if this feeling is part of the journey or something I should take seriously.",

          "text": "Funny, I just posted a YT video about this exact thing a few seconds ago.  Lack of confidence is very common (I wonder if the algo directed me to your post).  \n\nSome people suggest what you are feeling is due to \"limiting beliefs\" caused by some trauma or how you grew up.  While some of that may certainly exist for some people (not a psychologist), I think it comes down to lack of experience.  \n\nThose of us with experience are more willing to jump and take the risk because we have the confidence to figure things out as we go — even though we know we could still fail.\n\nNormally, you gain confidence through life experience and through practice. I like to say that practice builds confidence and confidence builds skills — and skills pay the bills.  \n\nWatching a bunch of videos on how to do business is not practice.  Buying a course that describes a business recipe is not practice.  \n\nSo when you start taking steps to start your business, you realize you are not sure what to do next — that's the lack of confidence due to lack of practice or experience.\n\nIMO the fastest way to gain this confidence is through simulated experience — ie, play business simulation games. Just like a pilot learns to fly an airplane with a flight simulator, it's possible to do the same with business.",

      "text": "I'm in the middle of filing my LLC paperwork here in California and I've hit a bit of a crossroads. I'm trying to decide if I should just list myself as the Registered Agent or if I should actually pay for a service.\n\nI really want to list myself as the RA since I meet all the requirements and I need this business address listed somewhere officially connecting it to my business. I'm asking this question because it's a dilemma because of something that happened with a friend and need more people's advice on what to do.   \n  \nSo this friend of mine started a small consulting gig last year and decided to be his own agent to save money. Long story short, he went on a much-needed camping trip for a week where he had zero cell service. That was the exact window when a legal notice regarding a minor contract dispute was delivered to his house. Because he wasn't there to sign for it and accept service, things got messy with the court dates, and he ended up paying way more in legal fees to fix the default than he ever would have spent on a registered agent.\n\nI get that this should convince me to get a registered agent service and I shouldn't be asking over here, but is does this happen frequently or my guy got extra unlucky?\n\nAnd also, what's everyone seeing for pricing? Most of the sites I’ve looked at seem to be in the $100 to $300 per year range, but I’ve seen some introductory offers for $50 that jump up later. Are there any hidden fees I should watch out for?",
