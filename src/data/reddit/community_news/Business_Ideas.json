      "text": "Hey everyone. Today I'm going to share with you the most important knowledge that I've accumulated from starting 9 different companies, reading 59 books on business and personal development, and most importantly successfully breaking $2,000,000 in yearly revenue.\n\nMy goal is that if even 1 person reads this and it gives them the confidence to get started I will have contributed positively to somebodies life, and that brings me joy.\n\nNow let's go.\n\n# Pick a business model \n\nThis is the easiest part to get hung up on, the way I've conquered this obstacle is by realizing I don't have to reinvent the wheel. There are thousands of profitable business models in the world and if you truly want to live the dream of financial freedom and break the chains of the 9-5 you can very simply pick one and replicate it. Remember “good artists borrow, great artists steal.”\n\n**Okay, but how do I pick one? There are so many that it's hard to choose!** Don't worry I got you, choice paralysis is real, we all get it.\n\n*Here are the 3 variables you need to be investigating and doing the math around in order to pick the right business for you.*\n\nVariable #1 **- Cost to start up AKA barrier to entry:** This variable is identified by simply imagining what would go into starting this business. *What are the costs associated with those things?* Imagine you were starting a meal prep business, you would need the right kitchen equipment, plastic containers, the food itself, and the transportation to bring it to the clients. Investigate how much these things would cost you and total it up, the number you land on is the Barrier to Entry Cost, write this down.\n\nVariable #2 **- Skills needed to be successful in this industry:** Some businesses require experts, while others can utilize high school students at minimum wage. If you are already an expert in a field it may be easier to build something you are comfortable with but it's absolutely not a requirement. Out of the 7 companies I have built I was only fluent in 1 and my most successful I knew nothing about. Figure out which skills are needed and do some thinking, do you have access to people with these skills? Can you hire people with these skills? Can you learn these skills in a day on youtube? Typically the lower the skill needed the more simple a business will be and trust me you want simple because once you start doing millions in revenue the headaches will pile up.\n\nVariable #3 **- How long will it take to get this business operational?** You would be surprised how quickly you can start *most* businesses. In a matter of 2 weeks I had people calling my phone for my biggest company and all it took were some street signs. Do some thinking on how long it will take for you to buy all the necessary equipment and get that phone to ring. Do you need a website? Do you need equipment or a product that will take months to develop or get to you? I highly recommend starting with a business model that can be operational in under a month, I say this because in order to withstand the punches that the business world will throw at you it helps to see tangible progress. When you spend 6 months in R&D it's tough to stay motivated.\n\n# Personal tips for choosing your FIRST business model\n\n1. Don't start a business where you will need to raise money to be successful, chances are if you are reading this it's not happening. The people that successfully raise money typically have rich parents or already have a track record of success. Choose a model you have close to enough cash to fund yourself. (My businesses had barrier-to-entry costs ranging from as low as 1k to as high as 22k)\n2. Choose a model that doesn't require full-time experts, these people cost a lot of money to employ and they typically don't want the risk of working with a pre-cash flow business.\n3. Choose a model that you can spin up in a couple of weeks to a month.\n\nBy now you should have a couple of assets in your head, which model you like, the things you need and how much they cost, and which skills you will need to hire for or know yourself to be successful.\n\n# NOW WHAT?\n\nNow we build.\n\nDepending on your model you will have 1 or more of the following. Google Listing and Website.\n\nGoogle listing you can make yourself but unless you're experienced in web development and digital product marketing 100% do not do this yourself, it is a colossal waste of time and it will hurt your ability to make the phone ring because it will take months and months of iterating in order for it to be halfway decent. Hire someone to build a website for you, there are services that do it for a $300 startup fee and $100 a month. DON'T BUILD YOUR OWN SITE.\n\nWith the website/google listing live we now focus on sales and in order to do that we need to make the phone ring AKA drive leads. Depending on the industry you choose these are the magic tools that will bring you money.\n\n**GOOGLE PAY PER CLICK -** I can't stress this enough, it works. 99% of industries can utilize google PPC, Meal prep? PPC, Cleaning service? PPC, E-comm? PPC, Sex toys? ALSO PPC. (I spend roughly 5k a month on PPC, it's magic.) **AVERAGE SETUP COST $800**\n\n**Facebook Ads and Instagram ads -** Known your target audience before spending money here, does your audience live on these platforms? Does your industry fit on a social media platform where people are probably watching cat videos? **AVERAGE SETUP COST $600**\n\n**Angi's list and other contractor platforms -** The leads can be hit or miss but they absolutely will make your phone ring. **AVERAGE SETUP COST $350 MONTHLY**\n\n**Upwork and other freelance platforms -** Lower quality leads but a great way to cut your teeth in an industry. **SETUP COST FREE**\n\n**YARD SIGNS (Zip tied to telephone poles) -** I've used this in several of my businesses and it has driven hundreds of thousands of revenue, (Legal disclaimer I don't know the rules of your area, but in mine certain towns call us and say it's not allowed and others leave them up or take them down themselves) **you can get 50 signs for roughly $500 from your local sign maker.** those 50 signs could stay up for 10 years and drive you significant revenue. (Vista print signs are much cheaper quality than something you would get locally, if you want the sign to last years, don't skimp on the $50 you would save)\n\nThe equation is simple - How much does it cost to create 1 customer using X ad platform, and how much profit does 1 customer on average bring your business? if the profit created is higher than the cost to acquire the customer then it is a successful marketing strategy and you can dump thousands into it and consistently make a profit.\n\n**Okay but what if I don't know how to set up google PPC or Facebook ads?** NO PROBLEM I DONT EITHER!\n\nHere's where the special sauce comes in, listen carefully.\n\nWhen you don't know something, but you need it in order to build the business do this exactly.\n\n1. Go to Upwork or a similar site\n2. Create a detailed, simple, and KIND job posting that shows that you mean business and are serious about hiring for this position.\n3. Book calls with as many experts as you possibly can (I personally just put my phone number on the listing and open the floodgates because the scheduling process can be annoying)\n4. Talk to ATLEAST 6 experts describing what you need to accomplish and asking them specifically how they would go about accomplishing it if you were to hire them. (Ask as many questions as you possibly can)\n5. Use your best judgment to choose the highest-value contractor to achieve your goal.\n6. PROFIT? No, but really, I use this process probably 8 times a year, by speaking with experts for hours on end who are trying to win your business they will give you all the insight you need to have a working knowledge of a subject.\n\nDon't be afraid of the hourly rate they have, it usually ends up being a lot less hours than you would think\n\nDISCLAIMER: Freelance websites have a lot of low-quality contractors, DO NOT hire someone until you've talked to 6 people, you need to find the diamond in the rough. (Trust me they are there, I have found some incredible partners who I still have on retainer to this day)\n\nExamples of hires I have made through freelance websites\n\nWeb development, Graphics Design, Drawing up a sales contract, SEO, Fashion Designer, Logo Maker.\n\n\\*\\*Okay so now we a website/google listing and leads coming in, whats next?\\*\\*Fulfill the orders!! Sell those shirts, cook those meals, cut those lawns, develop those websites, WHATEVER IT IS JUST DO IT!\n\nThere is a 100% chance you will make mistakes and clients will get mad at you, welcome to the business world. Stand behind your work and make it right, don't do shady shit.\n\nI promise this is one of the most rewarding things you can do with your life, when done right it can pay you far more than any job would and more importantly give you your time back! Imagine only working 5 hours a week (From your cell phone) and getting paid 30k a month. That's only possible by owning your own business. Don't stop pushing, don't let the punches knock you out. Take what you deserve and never settle.\n\n# Managing Your Cash Flow\n\nYou can have $1M in sales and still go bankrupt if your bank account hits zero on rent day. This is the \"boring\" stuff that separates the amateurs from the $1M+ founders.\n\n**The \"Net-30\" Trap:** If you’re doing B2B (business-to-business), many clients won't pay you for 30, 60, or even 90 days. If you have to pay your contractors *today* but don't get paid for two months, you are effectively a bank lending money to your clients.   \n  \nAlways try to get a **50% deposit upfront** or use \"Progress Payments.\" Never finance a client's project with your own rent money.  \n  \n**The \"Profit vs. Cash\" Reality:** Profit is what’s left on paper. Cash is what’s in the bank. You need a \"War Chest\" of at least 3 months of operating expenses.\n\nAs soon as you make your first $5,000, don't buy a watch. Put it in a high-yield savings account. That is your \"Stay in the Game\" fund for when Google Ads gets expensive or a client disputes a charge.  \n  \n**Automate Your Accounting:** Spend the $30/month on software like QuickBooks or Xero immediately. If you wait until tax season to \"figure out your numbers,\" you’ve already lost. You need to see your **burn rate** (how much you spend monthly) in real-time.\n\n# Final general tips \n\nDO NOT try to do everything yourself, you are definitely not the best person to be doing it and you will kill yourself in the process. Bad end product and not sustainable, hire 1099 experts.\n\nLaunch before you're ready, do not try to make everything perfect, do not try to dot all your i's and cross all your T's it will never happen. The learning is in the doing, its in the mistakes, its in the mad clients.\n\nOutsource as much of the business as you can, find no-contract partners to do everything you don't know how to do. Example - I have an accounting partner, ($300 a month) a tax strategist partner ($2500 a quarter) an SEO partner ($1700 a month) a google PPC partner ($300 a month) a content creation partner ($800 a month)\n\nIt is better to be at the higher end of industry pricing for whatever market you are in, higher cost = higher margins and less headaches because it requires fewer customers. And oddly enough its the smaller customers that are the neediest.\n\nRemember to pay yourself first, never under any circumstances be the least paid person in the business. It is far too easy to get in the habit of oh ill make money next year. No make a profitable business now or go work for someone. Build a rock-solid foundation that lines your pocket and doesn't require 80 hours of your time a week.\n\nWell guys that's about all the writing I have in me, there is definitely more I wanted to include but its almost 5am where I'm currently living. I'm starting a discord for people who want help getting started (Think lists of softwares, people i trust in different industries ect) all 100% free just trying to give back to a community that I love so much. Send me a PM if you would like to be apart of it\n\nGood luck out there.",

Its just manual trial and error and I use a json as the profile template. My problem is I feel its too jankey to sell but I deal with the jankey stuff because I can spend an hour and get a profile dialed in and save it and it works 90% of the time and im able to get the money info and dates into a database that can export csv or whatever for a book keeper. I developed it because I have adhd and I cant stay organized with paperwork everywhere so its way easier to keep a folder on the PC with each month of records and then get it all into a data base and its all there basically. Ive automated a huge chunk of the repeating tasks basically all I gotta do is take pictures of receipts with a scanner app and then transfer them into the folder when im home. And boom I can process the receipts and bank accounts in under an hour. And hell im usually screwing around on my phone for most of the hour so a normal person it would probably be 30 mins lol 😆",

It remembers who sent what, automatically reminds you to pay unpaid invoices, and marks tasks as completed when payment is received.\n\nIt would only interrupt you if something was past due or required attention; otherwise, you would continue working as you currently do.\n\nFor you, would something like that truly lower the mental overhead?

Also worth pressure testing if this is really a mentoring program or a curriculum plus community, those are very different beasts operationally.

I’ve been doing a ton of research, but I keep going back and forth on whether I need to form an LLC or if I can just start selling as a sole proprietor.  \n  \nHere’s the thing, I’m not planning to quit my day job anytime soon, and I’m starting super small. Like, maybe $500 in sales a month if I’m lucky. But I’ve heard horror stories about people getting sued or having their personal assets at risk because they didn’t have an LLC. On the other hand, I don’t want to overcomplicate things or spend money on legal fees if it’s not necessary right now.  \n  \nMy cousin started selling vintage clothes on Etsy a few years ago and never bothered with an LLC. She was doing pretty well until someone claimed they got a rash from one of her sweaters (turned out they were just allergic to wool, but still). She ended up settling out of court, and it was a huge headache. Now she swears by her LLC, but I’m not sure if her situation applies to me.  \n  \nSo, do I need an LLC from the start, or can I wait until I’m making more money? For those of you who sell online, did you start with an LLC or wait until later? Any advice would be super appreciated.",

It's simple, and free, but make sure to report the income on your regular taxes. \n\nThe reason you'd want to open an LLC, is to have limited liability. If someone sues your business, an LLC helps keep your personal assets (like your car, savings, etc.) separate from the business. That’s what your cousin’s situation was really about.\n\nSince it's a small business, and you're selling handmade pens specifically, your risk is relatively low, and I would definitely recommend starting as sole proprietor. If later on you decide to go full in, it might be a good idea to open an LLC once you’re making steady money or scaling up.\n\nPS.

              "text": "To add to this one should always understand two principals when talking about how an LLC/Corp limits liability.\n\nFirst is the idea of piercing the veil which is the legal point that the courts can choose to let a lawsuit of an LLC/Corp go directly after personal assets.  This normally happens when the corp is closely held by one or a small number of owners and said owner(s) are directly involved.\n\nSecond is they can always sue you personally even if you are just an employee. \n\nA lot of advice to small and/or new business way overhype the protection you get from an LLC.   If they sue they will go after your personal assets and nothing will stop that if you are a solo owner working in the business.  Any lawyer worth his salt will at least sue the owner in addition to the business.  \n\nLoads of reasons to have an LLC but the \"limited liability\" part needs to be framed correctly.\n\nMost small and especially new businesses have no reason to be LLCs when they are basically a relatively low paid job for the owner/worker.  \n\nOnce you get bigger, have employees, and/or have tax or other reasons to then get an LLC or other corp.",

It just changes what’s typically at risk.\n* If you mix funds, skip basic paperwork, or personally cause harm (negligence), the “shield” can be weaker.\n\nFor handmade pens, the bigger early risks are usually practical, not legal structure:\n\n* Sales tax and permits: you may need a sales tax permit and to collect/remit sales tax depending on where you sell and where buyers are.\n* Local business license and a DBA/fictitious name filing if you sell under a shop name.\n* Product liability: consider simple product liability insurance once you’re shipping regularly, especially if you use finishes, adhesives, or include small parts.\n\nA common path (and what we see at BusinessAnywhere) is:  \nStart as a sole proprietor with a separate bank account and clean records, then form an LLC once sales are consistent, you’re taking larger orders, or you’re worried about personal asset exposure.",

      "text": "1.)  I live in a suburb of Chicago.  Weather is terrible, all our cars look terrible most of the time but I still like to get my car washed regularly.  Other unrelated fact: shopping centers are suffering.  I live near Oak Brook mall and I would LOVE if a car wash service posted up in one of the parking garages.  It feels archaic to have to go to some random car wash and just sit there and wait.  I understand this probably does take place in certain areas of the US but not near me!  I know there are also mobile car washes but not near me...especially in the winter.  I would love to either be home or able to run a few errands such as at a mall while my car was getting washed.  I know at some large corporate buildings they offer this in their parking garages but people are working onsite less so I could see a need for this.  Plus, I would think the shopping malls would cut a deal on the real estate required because it would bring in more traffic.  I would happily go to the mall and walk around (probably end up buying something) if this existed.  Thoughts?\n\n2.)  I think there should be some type of app where people can anonymously upload their budget spreadsheets.  You'd also need to fill in your annual household income.  I think it would be incredibly helpful to look at other people's budgets that have a similar household income as me.  My husband and I argue about what our annual budget should be.  We have SO much in savings (a lot a lot) and he constantly thinks we should be saving more.  I think let's enjoy life a little more.  Quick background, when he grew up his house was foreclosed on so I think he operates from a place of fear and saving brings him SUCH comfort.  So we have done a good job at that for a long time but, at a certain point, at what cost?  I think it would be helpful to compare and understand spending statistics of other similar families.  I also think people that are poor with savings could really learn from how other families do it.  Thoughts?",

Traditional vending works because it can be dropped almost anywhere. As soon as you require plumbing, permits, and ongoing sanitation checks, your buyer is no longer a vending operator, it is a venue operator who already has alternatives like fountains or bar soda guns.\n\nSanitation is also not a small problem. Anything involving reusable nozzles, ice, or exposed liquid creates maintenance and liability costs that can easily erase the margin advantage unless you solve this with a very simple, very robust design.\n\nIf I were pressure testing this, I would first ask where this works better than existing options. High foot traffic venues that do not want staff involvement but already have water access might be the only real fit. Offices, gyms, campuses, hospitals. If you cannot clearly name the buyer and the installation decision maker, that is where most hardware ideas die.\n\nNot saying it cannot work, but the success here is less about soda economics and more about installation friction, compliance, and who actually says yes.",

I’m doing the paperwork on the PA Business One-Stop Shop portal tonight, but I’m a little stuck on the \"Registered Office\" section.\n\nI know most states call it a \"Registered Agent,\" but PA seems to insist on a physical \"Registered Office\" address. I'm currently working out of my house. Is it a bad idea to just use my home address? I’ve heard horror stories about your personal address being plastered all over public records for every solicitor to find, but I don't really want to shell out $200/year for a CROP (Commercial Registered Office Provider) if I don't have to.  \n  \nAlso, I saw that PA just switched from that weird 10-year \"decennial\" report to a **yearly $7 report** starting last year. If I file my Certificate of Organization today (Feb 2026), is my first $7 report due by Sept 30th of *this* year, or do I get a pass until 2027?  \n  \nThe online portal mentions a \"Docketing Statement\" (Form DSCB:15-134A). Is this something I have to fill out separately, or does the system just generate it when I finish the Certificate of Organization?  \n  \nI’m thinking of calling it \"Delco Draft & Pipe LLC,\" but I read somewhere that PA is super picky about \"restricted\" words. Does anyone know if \"Draft\" is going to trigger some manual review because it sounds like a bank or something?\n\nAny advice from fellow PA small biz owners would be huge. Trying to avoid that $125 filing fee going to waste because I checked the wrong box.\n\nCheers!",

      "text": "TL.DR: Looking for a deep dive review/experience before I pull the trigger for a Texas LLC. \n\nHey everyone.\n\nI could really use some real-world feedback right now. I'm planning to start a service-based business and I'll likely be operating in multiple states eventually, but starting off with Texas.\n\nI've been looking at Northwest Registered Agent and they seem to be darling of Reddit compared to other services like Legalzoom or Zenbusiness. But I'm always skeptical when it sounds too good to be true, or over-whelming good reviews. \n\nI've read that they let you use their office address on the actual Articles of Organization (not just for service of process). Does this actually work in Texas to keep my home address off the public record?  \n  \nThey claim they scan everything locally and notify you immediately. For those who use them, is the dashboard actually clean? There's a lot of talk about having Corporate Guides instead of a random call center. Has anyone actually called them with a weird question? Do they actually know their stuff, or is it just marketing speak for \"customer support\"?\n\nAnd since I'm looking at expanding, how easy is it to add a second or third state later? Is it a nightmare to manage multiple registered agents through one account?\n\nI had a friend who used a different LLC formation service, and while the first year was $0, the renewal fee jumped to like $300 without warning. I’ve also heard horror stories about some services selling your data to business credit telemarketers the second you file. Do Northwest actually respect your data, or am I going to get 50 calls a day for business loans once I sign up?\n\nIf you've used them recently (especially in 2025/2026), I’d love to hear the good, the bad, and the ugly.",

Places like ZenBusiness get u with that $0 entry but then hit u with massive renewals later, whereas NW has stayed flat for me the whole time. The privacy thing is real too—they let u use their address for the filings so ur home address doesn't get blasted on the public record, and their support is actual people who know what they're talking about, not just reading scripts. If u want to avoid the spam calls and keep ur data somewhat safe, they're probably ur best bet for a service-based biz.",

That is usually where people get surprised.\n\nFrom what I have heard, the dashboard and scanning are solid and the appeal is consistency and privacy rather than bells and whistles. The bigger risk is not the service itself but forgetting about renewals or assuming everything is covered automatically.\n\nIf you are expanding to multiple states, having one provider can simplify things, but costs add up quickly so it helps to be very intentional about where you actually need to register versus where you are just operating remotely.",

And their customer service is really responsive. At least, based on my experience with them.\n\nSo I believe the reason why they get so much love on Reddit is that they're low-key, reliable, and don't nickel-and-dime you like some of the others. I'm talking about Zenbusiness, Legalzoom, Bizee.\n\nIf I had to do it again, I'd still choose Northwest without hesitation. ",

This means you'll have challenges or find it impossible to use a Northwest address for GMB.\n\nGiven GMB is massively important place to create social proof with online reviews and huge driver of business for us, not being able to verify a GMB would be a total deal breaker.

A shared creative space solves a real problem for musicians who do not have access to gear, space, or a community to collaborate with.\n\nThe biggest thing I would think about early is usage patterns. Gyms work because people come regularly and equipment scales well. Music spaces tend to be more bursty. Someone might come a lot for a few weeks and then disappear. That does not kill the idea, but it affects how memberships should be structured and priced.\n\nNoise control, scheduling, and wear on equipment are also real operational challenges. You would probably want very clear time slots, booking rules, and accountability so it does not turn into chaos or burnout for whoever is running it.\n\nWhere this really shines is community. If people feel like they belong there and not just rent a room, retention becomes much easier. Group jams, beginner friendly sessions, and hosted events could matter more than the gear itself.\n\nOverall it feels viable if started small and local, almost like a pilot space. If you can prove people show up consistently and bring friends, that is when the membership model really starts to make sense.",
