I'm sure you learned a lot in the process. Some thoughts to consider:\n      Could an employee (maybe only 5 hours a week, more or less) handle meeting the customers at the site? Have a few set hours and charge more for appointments outside those hours? Someone who lives close by? A mom or a bright teenager who could do homework when not busy? Or he or she could learn about local and on-line marketing and implement it during hours when no one shows? Maybe someone whose school or college could give them credit as an internship learning experience?      \n     I wonder if you'd consider adding some other products or services that would appeal to the same customers and add to your profit? Toys and kids' clothing? Maternity clothing? \n     Or one or more activities, maybe one day a week: Homework help? Math/engineering club? Lego club? \n     I realize you want to sell the business and let it go, and that might make the most sense. But it is easier to sell a profitable business. I couldn't help sharing my thoughts, but I realize they are a different direction. \n     Best wishes to you in whatever you pursue in the future!",

You can listen to it like a podcast or audiobook, even with the app running in the background.\n\nThe app is privacy-friendly and doesn’t request any permissions by default. It only asks for access if you choose to share files from your device for audio conversion.\n\nYou can also take or upload a photo of any text, and the app will extract and read it aloud.\n\nThe app is called Frateca.

Text to audio itself is pretty crowded now, so the question is who this is for and when they would choose it over built in OS or browser features.\n\nI would pressure test the core use case. Is it for long form reading like PDFs and Substack, or for quick capture like photos and snippets? Those are very different behaviors and onboarding flows. Quality of voice matters, but so does friction. How many taps from link to listening, and does it remember context across sessions?\n\nIf you have early users, I would watch where they drop off. If people convert one thing and never come back, the value prop is probably too generic. Narrowing to one strong habit often works better than trying to cover every input type at once.",

The actual edge probably comes from stuff people don't share.\n\nNot trying to be negative just exhausted by the information quality out there. for those of you who actually built something sustainable after a failed first business, how did you filter signal from noise? what made you trust the opportunity was real and not just another hype cycle?",

          "text": "I have a dropshipping model and while it is profitable, it is extremely stressful. $1.8M rev, $450k profit. Thing is, I have maybe 4 competitors, and stuff I sell minimum costs $25k, top range $220k. No one will share the industry and products that work for them. I sure as hell wouldn’t want to encourage competitor #5 to enter. I also have a heavy bias towards selling shit that costs at minimum $10K+. I can’t be bothered with anything less. I agree with what others said below; gotta think outside the box. I started out first as becoming a sales rep / dealer for a new manufacturer (they found out what I was doing to get leads and sales, and they kicked me out so they can go do it themselves). After throwing a pity party for 5 months, I later found an overseas manufacturer that wanted to break into USA market and I was able to become a distributor for their products (showed them my past track record when I sold the other mfg’s products) and it worked — signed an iron clad territory agreement, and the rest was history. That’s where I found success. Try finding small mfgs and becoming a sales rep for their line, and work out of their inventory. I guarantee it’ll work to get you some $$ in your pocket. And then you can start really thinking about which product line(s) you want to really go after, private label, etc to get higher margins. (Then can go visit factories, etc etc.) Word of caution for private labeling: insurance companies don’t insure those types of products because then they see you as the OEM and you’d need to get a completely different type of premium insurance and can be costly.",

          "text": "Qualifying customers has a lot of value. However, you have a couple misconceptions. \n\n>most of the time they pick creators based on followers or vibes\n\nMost big brands have far more sophisticated metrics than \"vibes\". There are a million formulas & approaches used to determine who might be the best influencer for a given product. \n\nThe reason you think it's \"most\" is because the brands you hear the most are mass-market direct to consumer brands like SurfShark or Delete Me that are simply trying to carpet-bomb the market. These are mass market plays, not surgical precision plays. *They* don't need qualitative data. \n\n>So I built a way to analyze influencer comment sections to find which creators have the highest % of people actively asking things like: “Does this work?” “Where do I buy?” “Is this good for acne?”\n\nSo you built an AI agent that reviews comments. How do you validate your predictions? You tell me that the audience of Influencer X is far more likely to be ready to buy my product. How do you ever show it to be true, even in retrospect? \n\nAdditionally, why would an influencer audience's \"readiness to buy\" sunscreen mean they were more likely to buy my new sunglasses or phone accessory or tax service? Readiness to buy is product specific. If Influencer X has ads promoting a sunscreen and your software says, \"Influencer X's audience wants sunscreen!\" then what do I do with that information? They are more ready to buy *because* they have seen the ads of my competitor. It's extremely unlikely that that influencer will be contractually permitted to promote *MY* sunscreen at that point. \n\nLastly, how would this product deal with changes to social media policy or TOS. Twitter used to allow you to harvest all the data associated with public accounts. Now it doesn't. Your crawlers will be flagged quickly as your business scales. This data always has to be up to date—nobody is going to pay for weeks old data.",

That is exactly where a challenger brand wins.\n\nIf Influencer X is already talking about Acne Cream A, it does Acne Cream B no good to know that his audience is problem-aware and solution-seeking because that influencer can't **also** sign with their competing acne cream. It's incredibly rare for influencer agreements not to include some minimal level of exclusivity or affiliate commissions. \n\nHow would your product work if the influencer isn't *already* pitching a product? It seems like a Catch 22: it tells you your competitor is *about* to succeed or lets you know the ground isn't fertile. \n\n>On 'Validation': I’m not selling predictive analytics software; I’m selling an outcome. The validation is simple: I send them the influencers, they run the campaign. If ROAS is positive, the model works.\n\nI get pitched on a million products per year. I can tell you that the ones that require me to invest in them to validate the concept make up almost 0% of my marketing stack. I need data and white pages and evidence to justify investment. That will be a big hurdle to get around. \n\nWill you be giving out freebees? \n\n>On APIs/Scale: This is internal infrastructure to power a service business, not a public-facing crawler.\n\nMaybe I'm not following your concept here. I assumed you were an ongoing service. Are you selling software that businesses deploy and use themselves? Otherwise, I'm not following the difference between a public and non-public crawler. They're both still beholden to TOS. Since Meta, TikTok, and every other platform already have official or unofficial Influencer agencies, it seems like they'd want to shut you down. \n\n>You’re looking at this through a Product Manager lens (Scalability/TOS), which is fair. I’m looking at it through a Sales lens (Revenue/Conversion). For now, the latter pays the bills\n\nIf you are at the \"validate my idea\" phase, there are **no** bills being paid, right now. SaaS products are attractive because the logistics scale downward. If you're dealing with ChatGPT tokens and per-business scrapers, your business doesn't scale like an SaaS, it scales like a service. That's certainly not a bad thing, but it's not about project management or conversion, it's about modeling future earnings. \n\nOn a slightly different note, have you considered your software as an attribution toolset for advertisers? Influencer campaigns are notoriously hard to track—I could see there being value in a simple tool that automates the tracking of sentiment on a post-by-post basis to hone messaging?",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nHappy New Year. Hope 2026 has started well for all of you.\n\nI’m currently building a managed home services platform that owns pricing, execution standards, and customer outcomes, using vetted providers as supply. This is not a free-form marketplace. The product, operating model, and groundwork are already in motion. What I’m now looking for is the right person to take real ownership over growth and early execution alongside me.\n\nI’ve spent the last 15 years working hands-on in property maintenance and residential environments in London. I’ve seen how jobs actually get quoted, delayed, under-delivered, and argued over in the real world, not just how platforms say they work. That experience is the reason this isn’t being built as a typical marketplace. The failures are structural, not marketing-related, and the model reflects that.\n\nHome services is a massive, fragmented market. In London alone, it’s worth billions annually. Demand is not the problem. The problems are trust, reliability, pricing clarity, and operational consistency. That’s where most platforms fail, and that’s exactly where we’re building differently.\n\nThe model is deliberately simple and execution-driven. Clear pricing, no bidding wars, no race to the bottom, and no vanity metrics. The focus is completed jobs, happy customers, reliable providers, and unit economics that actually make sense.\n\nWe’ll be starting with a geographically focused launch in London to build proper density before expanding. How you think about early traction, how you convert demand into real completed work, and how you build operational discipline early matters far more than buzzwords or theory.\n\nI’m already speaking with candidates through multiple channels, including YCombinator’s co-founder matching, and I’m being very selective about who I spend time with. This is an equity-based role with real ownership and responsibility from day one. It’s not an advisory position and not a short-term engagement.\n\nI’m looking for someone who wants genuine co-founder-level ownership across growth and operations. Someone comfortable in messy early stages, willing to move fast, test channels, speak directly to customers and providers, and be accountable for outcomes, not just ideas.\n\nIf this resonates, send me a DM with your LinkedIn and include the following:\n\n- How you would approach the first phase.\n- Where you would start within London and why. \n- How you would get the first real customers and ensure jobs actually get completed. \n- Which acquisition channels you would test first. \n- What success would look like in the initial phase.\n\nThis probably isn’t a fit if you’re only looking to advise or if you’re uncomfortable with hands-on execution early on.\n\nIf there’s mutual fit, I’m happy to share more detail privately.\n\nRegardless of whether this resonates or not, hope you have a great year ahead!\n\n- Eddie",

For each country I’ve been to, I created very detailed PDF guides with popular and hidden spots, cultural tips, how to get around, and expectations vs. reality. I’ve always done this for fun and as a journal to remember my travels, but now I have a whole collection of guides just sitting on my computer.\n\nAfter telling a friend about it, she suggested I should sell them, since many people want to travel but don’t know how to plan it. I’m a very low-profile person and have never shared this online, but after some research I realized I could simply upload the guides to a platform and create an Instagram/TikTok profile to promote them.\n\nI’d love to get some feedback. I’m not expecting to make much money, but if this can bring in a few extra coins, I’d really appreciate it.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a solo founder based in Switzerland. I have zero formal coding experience, but over the last few months, I’ve \"vibe coded\" a platform called anewera.ch\n\nIt’s a sandbox-based AI agent builder—conceptually similar to Manus—and I built it because I needed it for my own workflows. Now that the agent space is exploding (with Meta's recent acquisition of Manus), I realize I’ve built something that could be a serious business, but I have zero users and no experience in scaling a SaaS.\n\nWhat the platform does right now:\n\n• Full Sandbox: It writes code and executes/deploys it in a secure environment.\n\n• MCP Server Integration: Connects to any MCP server, like Gmail, Google Sheets, etc.\n\n• Complex Workflows: It can do deep research -> web scraping -> create a landing page -> send a beautiful HTML email summary -> save results to a Sheet.\n\n• Long-Running Agents: You can tell it: \"Read my emails every day at 10 AM and make me a summary,\" and it just works.\n\n• File Handling: Native support for Excel, PDFs, and Docs.\n\nThe Situation:\n\nBecause I built this entirely through \"vibe coding\" without being a professional developer, there are definitely bugs here and there. The core engine is powerful and works, but it needs a professional touch to become a polished product.\n\nI’ve handled the product vision and the initial build alone. Now, I’m looking for a partner—ideally someone with a background in running a SaaS, marketing, or business operations—who wants to help me turn this from a powerful personal tool into a real product.\n\nI am based in Switzerland and would love to find someone who is excited about the AI Agent space to join me.\n\nIf you want to see a demo or chat about potentially joining forces, let’s talk.\n\nCheck it out here: https://anewera.ch",

      "text": "My New Year's Resolution, reducing reliance on paid leads. Over the last 5 years, I've started and worked with local service businesses where the main lead source was Angi or Thumbtack. It's the same story every time. You have a 4.8 star average review on Google, you pay to quote a lead, it's a fair price, but they end up going with Chuck in a Truck because he was $100 cheaper.\n\nI started to go where the money is. I put together a list of potential customers and networked. Over time, I became the guy that they thought of when their existing contractor showed up late. Or when he missed a spot for the fifth time. The list will vary based on the service that you offer but for the businesses I've operated and helped, these have been the honeypots.\n\nProperty Managers/Apartment Complexes - I put together a Google Map of all the apartments in my service area. I had 2 days/week where I would just drive to different ones and bring donuts, cookies, etc. I'd just give an intro but not even make an ask for a bid. I'm new in the business and want to introduce myself. Enjoy the treats! The goal is always to be likable.\n\nLocal Landlords - I'll look for rentals in my service area on Zillow, Redfin, Craigslist, etc and reach out to the landlords that are posting them. Again, this is about building a relationship and not necessarily making a pitch. If I can get them on the phone, then there's a good chance I will be able to pitch them when the time is right on that call.\n\nNew Homeowners - I target new homeowners who could potentially need my service. This one takes quite a bit of work and research and depends on the service offered. The same person I'd want to target if I'm a painter isn't the same person I'd want to target if I'm a landscaper. Then it's door hangers or mailers with a congrats on the new home message. Be a good neighbor.\n\nThe biggest mistake I see people make with their outbound is being overly aggressive. Odds are you aren't going to close them on the first interaction. If your goal is to try to get them to fire their guy on the spot, you lost. They don't trust you yet.\n\nI always try to be the safety net. That initial touchpoint is really simple. It's about introducing who I am, that I'm local, new in business (if true), and then a compliment about their property, office, complex, etc. Truly just be a human. Like you're meeting someone at a party for the first time. The treats are what lighten the mood.\n\nAnyone who works with contractors on a regular basis has been burned before by the Chuck in a Truck who didn't show up. Or who won't return their calls after they forgot to do part of the job. By being friendly and introducing yourself, you're putting yourself in first position to be their backup. It's a positive interaction that will keep you top of mind.\n\nEven if you're the most likable person they've met, assume that they're going to check your work. They're probably heading to Google after you leave to check your reviews and website. If you're new and you told them that, they may not put as much weight on this. It's why you should tell them if you are new. People like to give people chances. It's in our nature. Whatever you do, don't look like a hobbyist.\n\nThe interaction plants the seed but don't forget the follow up. You have to nurture that relationship. In the example of the property managers, I'll swing by when I have another job in their neighborhood to say hi and see how they're doing. I still do this even if I've gotten them to switch over to me. It just continues to reinforce the relationship. People want to do business with people they like. And firing you is really really hard if they like you.",

So even if you could manufacture a good quality shirt the mark up to get a tie with it will feel like wasted money. \n\nShoes with shoe tree - the issue here is quality, people dont tend to buy shoe trees and when they do its because the shoe is of exceptional quality. I dont think the average person is doing this for their everyday shoe so the premium you'd charge will put people off buying the shoe. \n\nPants and socks already exist. So you would be competing against existing brands\n\nSuits/shirt/ties - much like the wearing a shirt and tie, suits are rarely worn in the workplace. Men are buying less suits and but better quality, how are you going to manufacture high quality suits and then compete with well established brands.\n\nPolo/watch - this just is not a combo. Also are you becoming a watch maker? Or buying cheap ones from China? No one wants a shit watch when they buy a polo. \n\nSorry if this sounds like a savage take down of your idea, not my intention. I think you need to think about what the consumer of those products actually want/need. There maybe something in mens clothing that you could make a business out of, but I dont think this is it",

      "text": "Hiya, business fam! \n\nSo basically my small business idea is to demystify the cosmetic/fashion industry by creating incredibly detailed and personalized routines based on their face, personal preferences, time they have, religious, and/or social preferences (i.e. if they're boycotting something for a cause, finding a product from a company that supports the cause). We can also look at someone's wardrobe and put together some fits for them, analyze their body shape and see what clothes would look best for them based on their body. We can also recommend hair styles and colors based on their face shape, as well as accessories. It would also be nearly 100% because I'm planning for us to just use free resources like Canva/Google Slides to show clients their results of analysis/routines. I had a friend design a pretty awesome logo for free, and another make my website (and I insisted I could pay them both but they refused) I think the only few things that are cons are  \n1) I don't have a terrible amount of experience. Besides for a few friends birthday gifts in the past few years, I have no experience with this sort of thing. I just learn a lot and watch a lot of related content online.   \n2) Because I don't have much experience, I think it will take a lot of time to go through each client, but I assume that would get better with time/more experience. But that could cause problems when I first start up cause it could lead to cloggage (not sure if there's a better word for it, still really new to business)   \n3) I'm also worried we're offering too many services??? And that might make things confusing when we market or when we attract new customers   \nbut on the plus, side, I'm planning to have everything be super cheap! (because it's nearly 100% profit) Items won't be more than $20. That's also because I'm planning to market to   \n(also I saw \"we\" because I assume I will have employees in the future...right now it's just me haha)   \nThanks so much for your help in advance!   \n(P.S. some other things are:   \n\\+ I'm planning to market to the ambitious, intelligent, young women (or men!) who would love to present themselves better physically but may not have the time to research and explore and figure out what works best for them. (So these will most likely be highschoolers and/or college students who are broke, which is why my prices are so low)   \n\\+ how/which online payment should I use/set up? Would love to hear what other people are using/what works well for them. I'm trying to do my own research but terminology and what not is a bit confusing. ",

So why don't you do a test run with 5 to 10 clients for free, just to get a sense of 1) how long it takes to style 2) how long it takes to put together recommendations 3) gather their feedback about what they did and didn't like about the services (which could be used as testimonies/reviews later as you officially advertise the business).\n\nYou could also learn:\n\n* if there were elements of your service that maybe weren't needed or were needed that you didn't offer and you could add on.\n* how much time it takes so you can update your pricing structure and make sure you are paying yourself appropriately\n* if broke college students are the best clientele or if you should pivot to young professionals just entering the workforce, or people with unique body types and more disposable income or...\n\nEither way, the client you think you want might not be the client that's most likely to seek you out or most likely to be able to pay you sustainably.\n\nAnyway, good luck!",

The audience is monetized through a Shopify store using print-on-demand apparel and dropshipped accessories.

The reason many businesses are shifting into subscription based model is to minimize piracy of their software. When it is more affordable for the user to pay a little amount monthly than to pay a big sum upfront, they would rather subscribe than buy it. Remember before spotify, music piracy was at its peak. Before netflix, torrent was at its most busiest. You get the idea.\n\n2. As a business, you need cashflow to help grow your company. If they only pay you once, surviving long term will be a challenge. Unless you have a big funding and some capital to burn while youre trying to convert clients.\n\n3.

Track how often things come back late, damaged, or not at all, that’s the real business.

      "text": "Hey r/Business_Ideas,\nI have been thinking about a potential business concept in the eCommerce space and would really appreciate some honest feedback from the community.\n\nThe concept: An all-in-one AI-powered platform targeted at mid-sized online brands B2C, D2C or B2B that combines everything needed to run and scale a store storefront creation, inventory and order management, customer relationship tools, basic enterprise resource planning features, omnichannel selling (web, mobile, social media, marketplaces) and built-in analytics.\n\nIt would be positioned for businesses that have outgrown simpler drag-and-drop solutions but aren't quite ready or can't afford full-scale enterprise systems with massive implementation costs.\n\nStandout elements I'm considering:\n\nHeavy use of AI for personalized product suggestions, smarter search, visual discovery and automated cart recovery to improve conversion rates.\n\nPredictive tools for inventory to help avoid running out of stock or tying up too much cash in excess inventory.\n\nStrong focus on automation and integrations to cut down on manual work across tools.\n\nMain problems it would aim to address: Too many disconnected tools high platform fees eating into margins, loss of control over customer data and operational chaos as sales volume grows (especially in the $100k–$5M revenue range).\n\nA few questions to spark discussion:\n\nDo you think there's genuine demand for a smarter, more integrated option in this middle-market segment?\n\nWhat are the most frustrating scaling pains you have seen or experienced in eCommerce that something like this might miss?\n\nWhich features would be absolute must-haves and which would be nice-to-haves?\n\nAny obvious risks competition, technical challenges, pricing sensitivity, etc.?\n\nI'm looking for straightforward opinions: what works about the idea, what doesn't, potential tweaks or reasons it might struggle.\nThanks in advance for any thoughts!",

It's better to start with a simple function that any e-commerce user needs. \n\nFor example, everyone wants to sell. To sell, they need better photos or videos, or perhaps better AI optimized descriptions to appear in Chatgpt, etc. Focus on one problem. Sell that solution. Build it. Then you can gradually add other features. \n\nIn the long run, you'll have your full e-commerce platform. Just start small and focused.",

Since layoffs are rampant and there have been over 1M+ layoffs in 2025 alone, I’m sure layoffs will unfortunately continue in the new year.\n\nThis is where my idea comes in. I work in People Operations and hiring and have overcome 2 layoffs myself since 2020. I’m thinking about starting a side consulting business targeting companies who have recently gone through layoffs to help coach their managers on how to help maintain employee motivation and productivity after surviving layoffs. In addition to this, I would also pitch a package to help out their employees who recently got laid off to help with clarity, next steps, helping them land on their feet, etc. I’d like to try to pitch this as B2B so as not to go after vulnerable laid off employees..they’ve already suffered enough and I feel as though there’s too many “job search gurus” out there.\n\nAny feedback on this idea? I currently work full time and would like to figure out how to balance this/make sure my employer would be fine with me creating something like this on the side if they were to find out. I also would like to continue to build my LinkedIn presence, which my company will most likely see.\n\nTYIA and happy 2026!",

She has deep expertise not only in editing, but also in storytelling, direction, pacing, and high-end commercial standards.\n\nThe problem is that she never really made the jump to build something of her own. She’s incredible at what she does, but has always worked inside agencies and studios. I want to help her turn that experience into a side business, which could eventually become her main business.\n\nThe idea is to:\n\n\t•\tOperate remotely from Argentina (lower cost base)\n\n\t•\tOffer high-quality editing and post-production services to US-based clients\n\n\t•\tPosition it as senior-level, agency-grade work, not cheap low-quality outsourcing\n\nI’d love your thoughts on a few things:\n\n\t1.\tHow would you start validating this?\n\nCold outreach? Platforms? Networking? Content? Partnerships?\n\n\t2.\tPricing:\n\nWhat do experienced editors / studios usually charge in the US?\n\n\t•\tHourly vs project-based?\n\n\t•\tMonthly retainers for creators or brands?\n\n\t3.\tRemote structure:\n\nHow would you structure workflows, contracts, payments, revisions, time zones, etc. when working cross-border?\n\n\t4.\tPositioning:\n\nWould you sell this as a personal brand (editor-led) or as a small studio?\n\n\t5.\tAnything you’d avoid or do differently if you were starting today?\n\nIf anyone here is a content creator, brand owner, or agency and might need help with editing, we’re also happy to connect or even do test projects.\n\nI’m really trying to do this right and help her finally build something that’s hers, so any honest feedback is more than welcome.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

Senior, agency-level editing is a completely different market than generic remote editors, especially in the US.\n\nFor validation, I’d avoid broad freelancer platforms early - they usually push prices down and hide experience. Targeted outreach to agencies, production teams, and brands already running ads tends to work better, positioning her as an extension of their team, not outsourcing. A tight, curated portfolio that shows storytelling decisions often converts better than a big reel.\n\nPricing-wise, most experienced editors move away from hourly and toward project work or retainers. Buyers pay for reliability and standards, not location. Positioning it as a small studio led by a senior editor often feels safer to clients than a solo freelancer.\n\nWho do you want as your first core client: agencies, brands, or ad-driven creators?",

Are you aware of this trend? Could anyone share a clear example of how this could be applied in a business context? I imagine there might be some connection to AI or cybersecurity, but I’m not entirely sure",

The cynicism from those in and surrounding the trade community is high (and rightly so in many cases) but I wondered if anybody in the group had experience launching in the space and based on my website (I will not promote, simply for feedback and can share in the comments) can advise on what direction I should take the marketing in. My initial thoughts was through META Ads and I’ve had some small success ~£5 CAC on the leads (still to convert) with an LTV still to be estimated but in the £ hundreds.\n\nMy MVP is to monetise the local listings (£29 each town, discounts for multiple) with a view that once at a critical mass of coverage, I can diversify the product/service offering.\n\nMany thanks in advance!",
