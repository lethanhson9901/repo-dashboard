      "text": "Vector RAG has become the default pattern for coding agents: embed the code, store it in a vector DB, retrieve top-k chunks that it feels obvious to do so.\n\nWe tested this on a real production codebase (\\~1,300 files) and it mostly… didn’t work.\n\nThe issue isn’t embeddings or models but we realized that **similarity is a bad proxy for relevance in code**.\n\nIn practice, vector RAG kept pulling:\n\n* test files instead of implementations\n* deprecated backups alongside the current code\n* unrelated files that just happened to share keywords\n\nSo the agent’s context window filled up with noise and reasoning got worse.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39j5yotaaydg1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fd32a52a167a6b6f16e565874a2c5baab4ddc93\n\nWe compared this against an **agentic search approach using context tree** (structured, intent-aware navigation instead of similarity search). We won’t dump all the numbers here, but a few highlights:\n\n* **Orders of magnitude fewer tokens per query**\n* **Much higher precision on “where is X implemented?” questions**\n* **More consistent answers for refactors and feature changes**\n\nVector RAG did slightly better on recall in some cases, but that mostly came from dumping more files into context, which turned out to be actively harmful for reasoning.\n\nThe takeaway for me:\n\nCode isn’t documentation but it's a graph with structure, boundaries, and dependencies. If being treated like a bag of words, it will break down fast once the repo gets large.\n\nI wrote a [detailed breakdown](https://www.byterover.dev/blog/why-vector-rag-fails-for-code-we-tested-it-on-1-300-files) of the experiment, failure modes, and why context trees work better for code (with full setup in this [repo ](https://github.com/RyanNg1403/agentic-search-vs-rag)and metrics) here if you want the full take.\n\nLet me know if you've found better approach",

          "text": "Yeah this matches what I've seen. Vector similarity works when semantic proximity actually means relevance, which it does for docs but not for code.\n\nThe test file problem is brutal. Tests and implementations share so much vocabulary that embeddings can't distinguish them. Same with deprecated code sitting next to current versions. Structurally they're different, semantically they're nearly identical.\n\nYour context tree approach makes sense because code has explicit structure that embeddings throw away. Import graphs, call hierarchies, module boundaries. All that gets flattened into a vector.\n\nOne thing I'd add: the preprocessing step matters more than people realize. How you chunk code affects what gets retrieved. Function-level chunks vs file-level vs arbitrary token windows all produce different failure modes. I've been building [VectorFlow](https://vectorflow.dev/?utm_source=redditCP_i) to make that visible, being able to see what your chunks actually look like before embedding catches a lot of issues early.\n\nFor hybrid approaches, have you tried combining your tree navigation with vector search for specific cases? Like using structure for \"where is X implemented\" but falling back to similarity for \"find similar patterns to this function\"? Curious if there's a sweet spot.",

Everything I've seen in the past year+ was \"don't use RAG\". The agents tend to find what they need directly. At least that's been my experience. If I wanted to do something like this, I'd probably start a distinct conversation, use RAG to potentially highlight some hits, have a model review the results and pull out what the original model actually wanted. Keeps the noise out of the main context.\n\nIn our case, the agent just uses a combination of file search tools. Not that I'd be opposed to trying something else, but RAG just seemed like it wouldn't do a whole lot better.\n\nWe have a similar solution for searching and grabbing web content. Some agents do a \"web fetch\" that grabs a URL, pushes it through a markdown converter, then returns the content. That can fill up the context with useless info. Instead, we have a \"research\" tool that takes a detailed description of what the LLM wants, does a web search and content download, then extracts what the model is actually looking for in a concise \"report\".",

Solve these things and it will work better and more efficiently, as we've already been here many moons ago. I made a simple refactor mcp that accepted method name and method above and below to allow methods to be moved around files easily without needing to rewrite 3/4 of the file as a diff to great results, and there's so many things we already solved with ide's that have yet to be implemented for the new ai coding tools",

You really need a hybrid approach that combines metadata (paths, ownership, recency, file type, dependencies) with semantic signals to get anything reliable for code.\n\nPreprocessing also matters a lot here. Blind chunking or fixed-length chunks tend to bloat context and amplify noise, especially in large repos. Without structure-aware chunking, retrieval quality degrades quickly.\n\nAST-based approaches help, but they’re not sufficient on their own. Code understanding is repo-specific — effective chunking and retrieval usually need to align with the project’s architecture and conventions. That means maintenance and institutional knowledge of the codebase become first-class concerns, not implementation details.\n\nCurious if you experimented with metadata-weighted retrieval or repo-aware chunking alongside the context tree approach.",

My goal is to build a solid General Agent, but I want to make sure I start with the right tools.\n\nI keep hearing about LangGraph, but before I commit to learning it, I really want to know what the community considers the actual \"best\" framework right now.\n\nHere is what I’m hoping to learn from your experience:\n\n1. The #1 Recommendation: If you were starting a new project today, which framework would you choose and why? Is there a clear winner?\n2. LangGraph Reality Check: Is LangGraph truly the best option for a general-purpose agent, or is it overkill/too complex for a starter? What are its main pros and cons?\n3. General Best Practices: Regardless of the framework, what are the most important principles for building a stable agent?\n\nI’m looking for a solution that balances power with ease of use.

          "text": "Yo, OP, sit down and pay attention to your big bro right here. Also my bad, I didn’t know I talk to damn much.\n\r\nFirst of all, there is no Gold bro, also there are no standards (With respect to a few unknown places). Most of us are using the shit that works and keeps it moving. As engineers, we tend to want to build the most complex shit in the planet, then cry about the number of bugs and issues it has, then abandon the project, and talk about it like it was a unicorn. The important lesson hete to note is: ‘Reduce complexity whenever possible’ (Remember this for later).\n\r\nSecond, there are other Agent Frameworks other than LangGraph, but what are the true differences and when to choose what? I will give you a few Pros & Cons about other Agent Frameworks and a few Pros & Cons for using LangGraph as a Framework. Note: This is not an exhaustive list, it’s meant to give you a better understanding of how to choose what and when.\n\r\nOther Agent Framework Pros: They focus on reducing the amount of work you would put in to build a framework. Some of them have colorful IDEs, cute buttons to do so much shit for you, and a step-by-step guide better than the guide ChatGPT could give you. If these frameworks would speak they would say, “I will take care of the Agent Framework, you just choose what you want, click this button and you his button and whoop, aren’t you such a developer. Now go handle your other shit, I got this” and they truly do.\n\r\nOther Agent Framework Cons: They only have a limited selection of Agent frameworks. Literally, they have a few options and ask you to choose one bro. Of you can’t find what you need, it throws a fit and tells you, we can’t work together. \r\nTherefore, you must check if your use case can be built using one of these Frameworks, it will save you time and reduce complexity. They even tell you what they are compatible with and many more. It’s really helpful when you can use them. However, if you need something they don’t offer, it’s like speaking Chinese to them, more useless than a box of rocks.\n\r\nLangGraph Pros: This Agent Framework is built to redefine the word ‘Customization’. If we combine the amount of customization from an Android phone and a Linux OS, they won’t come close to the number of Customization that LangGraph has. Also, the number of tools that it has and can connect to. The most powerful feature its seamless integration with LangChain, and as you know LangChain by itself comes with more weapons than all of Call of Duty. \n\r\nLangGraph Cons: No fancy shit, deployment is a little sus with enterprise, requires actual coding, few files step up correctly to get this shit connected well.\nThere are some documentations, however, if you get stuck using a framework from LangGraph that doesn’t have enough documentations like me, come have a seat next to me, we can cry together. Note: The education courses on LangChain Academy is a beast in understanding LangGraph in more depth, avoid all others, trust me. Additionally, they are trying to build few templates, that anyone can use straight out of the box and works very well. However, if you are using a framework that doesn’t have a template like me, the seat next to me is still available bro.\r\n\n\r\nQuick Recap for my beginner bro, checkout the other agent frameworks that exists. Try to see all the Agent Framework features that they offer. All of them, I am serious, it will save you time and headache, trust me. Know that LangGraph is and will always be your backup option, while keeping in mind the massive overhead that you must take care of you on your own. Also, be very very careful about what has been deprecated recently when they released the new version and stick to the new version LangGraph v1. When Chatting with ChatGPT or whatever, ensure that you mention that you are using LangGraph v1, otherwise, this idiot could literally give you deprecated code and send you on a rabbit hole where there is no Wi-Fi down there. \n\r\nGood Luck bro,",

For most beginners, that’s a lightweight agent loop (tools + memory + logging) using whatever SDK you’re already comfortable with. LangChain can get you moving fast. LangGraph is great when you need control: multi-step workflows, branching, retries, and state you can inspect. But for a “general agent” as a first project, it can feel like overkill because you end up building a workflow engine before you’ve proven the agent needs one.\n\nLangGraph pros: more reliable orchestration, easier debugging of state, safer retries, and it scales better once you have multiple steps/roles. Cons: more structure, more upfront thinking, and it’s slower to iterate if you’re still learning what your agent should even do.\n\nBest practices that matter more than framework: keep context small and explicit, log everything (inputs/tool calls/outputs), design for failure (timeouts, retries, fallbacks), and don’t let the agent “free roam”… give it clear goals, constraints, and stopping conditions. If you do those, your agent will be stable in almost any framework.",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’m excited to share something we’ve been building for the past 6 months, a **fully open-source Enterprise Search Platform** designed to bring powerful Enterprise Search to every team, without vendor lock-in. The platform brings all your business data together and makes it searchable. It connects with apps like Google Drive, Gmail, Slack, Notion, Confluence, Jira, Outlook, SharePoint, Dropbox, Local file uploads and more. You can deploy it and run it with just one docker compose command.\n\nYou can run the full platform locally. Recently, one of our users tried **qwen3-vl:8b (16 FP)** with **Ollama** and got very good results.\n\nThe entire system is built on a **fully event-streaming architecture powered by Kafka**, making indexing and retrieval scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-time across large volumes of data.\n\nAt the core, the system uses an **Agentic Graph RAG approach**, where retrieval is guided by an enterprise knowledge graph and reasoning agents. Instead of treating documents as flat text, agents reason over relationships between users, teams, entities, documents, and permissions, allowing more accurate, explainable, and permission-aware answers.\n\n**Key features**\n\n* Deep understanding of user, organization and teams with enterprise knowledge graph\n* Connect to any AI model of your choice including OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, or Ollama\n* Use any provider that supports OpenAI compatible endpoints\n* Choose from 1,000+ embedding models\n* Visual Citations for every answer\n* Vision-Language Models and OCR for visual or scanned docs\n* Login with Google, Microsoft, OAuth, or SSO\n* Rich REST APIs for developers\n* All major file types support including pdfs with images, diagrams and charts\n* Agent Builder - Perform actions like Sending mails, Schedule Meetings, etc along with Search, Deep research, Internet search and more\n* Reasoning Agent that plans before executing tasks\n* 40+ Connectors allowing you to connect to your entire business apps\n\nCheck it out and share your thoughts or feedback. Your feedback is immensely valuable and is much appreciated:  \n[https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai](https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai)\n\nDemo Video:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9m3pwOgz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9m3pwOgz8)",

HMLR utilizes hierarchical routing and multi-hop reasoning to reliably persist and recall information, and it passes benchmarks such as the \"Hydra of Nine Heads\" on mini LLMs. (A full harness for reproducibility of tests is part of the repository.)\n\nKey features:\n\n* Drop-in LangGraph node (just added recently – makes it super easy to plug into existing agents)\n* Pip installable: pip install hmlr\n* Benchmarks showing strong recall without massive context bloat\n* Fully open-source (MIT)\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/Sean-V-Dev/HMLR-Agentic-AI-Memory-System](https://github.com/Sean-V-Dev/HMLR-Agentic-AI-Memory-System)",

Most hierarchical approaches nail retrieval but get noisy fast if you're not pruning or summarizing aggressively.\n\nTwo things I'd want to know before adopting something like this:\n\n- How does it handle cross-session deduplication? Mem0 and A-Mem both struggle when the same fact surfaces in slightly different forms.\n- What's the write path latency? Retrieval benchmarks look great, but if every turn blocks on memory updates you're eating that cost in UX.",

      "text": "We keep seeing deployment questions come up here, so wanted to share what we've built.\n\n**The problem:**\n\nLangGraph is great for building agents locally. But when you want to deploy:\n\n* LangSmith/LangServe are solid but your data goes through their infra\n* Self-hosting on AWS means ECS, IAM roles, VPCs, load balancers, secrets management...\n* Most tutorials stop at \"run it locally\"\n\n**What we built:**\n\nDefang lets you deploy any containerized app to your own AWS/GCP with one command. You write a compose.yaml:\n\nyaml\n\n    services:\n      agent:\n        build: .\n        ports:\n          - \"8000:8000\"\n        x-defang-llm: true\n\nRun `defang compose up`. Done. It provisions ECS, networking, SSL, everything.\n\nThe `x-defang-llm: true` part auto-configures IAM permissions for AWS Bedrock (Claude, Llama, Mistral) or GCP Vertex AI. No policy writing.\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\n* Your AWS account, your data, your infrastructure\n* Works with any LangChain/LangGraph setup (just containerize it)\n* Scales properly (ECS Fargate under the hood)\n* Free tier for open source repos (forever, not a trial)\n\n**We're launching V3 next week** with:\n\n* Named Stacks — deploy separate instances for dev/staging/prod or per customer from the same codebase\n* Agentic CLI — auto-debugs deployment errors, understands English commands\n* Zero-config AWS — one click to connect, no IAM policies to write\n\nWe have a LangGraph sample ready to go: [github.com/DefangLabs/samples](http://github.com/DefangLabs/samples)\n\nLaunching on Product Hunt Jan 21. \n\nHappy to answer questions about deploying LangGraph or agents in general.",

Here was my trajectory:\n\n1 year as a risk analyst |\n4 years as a sr risk analyst |\n2 years as a BI engineer |\n3 years as MLOps engineer |\n1 year as Lead AI Engineer \n\nMy degree is in philosophy... so let that sink in... You do not need a degree specifically in computer science or software engineering to get this kind of job but you will have to work your way from the bottom. \n\nMy original major was comp sci, but I found myself extremely bored with the classes and increasingly frustrated with the program and decided to pursue Philosophy with the goal of attending law school.\n\nAfter I graduated I realized I could not afford law school so I went to work in banking as a Jr risk analyst. \n\nI had a lot of experience in SQL and Python (7 years total in data analysis, programming and some data engineering / data wrangling), prior to getting my job as an MLOps engineer.\n\nI am completely self-taught and I got my first gig as an MLOps engineer because I had made connections in my company with individuals in the data science department via partnering with them on joint projects. I still had to pass two technical interviews and a technical project to get the job, and no one bothered asking me for my portfolio.\n\nI think personal portfolios are somewhat helpful if you're fresh of out of college, but from my experience most hiring managers want to see your real-world experience and are going to suss you out during the technical interviews.\n\nI would not recommend taking my path, as my journey into AI is somewhat atypical. It took me 7 years to work my way into it (almost by chance), and if I could go back I would have just stayed in my original major of comp sci.\n\nHowever the universe had other plans for me. So here I am, ironically in a career field I had originally shunned in my college years.\n\nWhat helped most to get the job? Sheer fucking grit and determination. Also, being curious about everything, wanting to learn everything I could and not being afraid to fail and try new things. Also, you need to have people skills. If you can't work as part of a larger team, you will not make it very far.",

Is that actually what's happening? Are there multiple api calls involved and it's not a fixed number i.e. could be 2 , could end up being 4/5? \n\nAdditional questions:\n\n1. Wouldn't this be very expensive to develop with the llm api call charges stacking?\n\n2. What about getting rate limited, with just one use of the agent requiring multiple api calls and having many users for the application?\n\n3. Wouldn't monitoring and debugging be very difficult in this case where you have multiple api calls and there could end up being an error(rate limit, hallucinaton) at any call? ",

One thing that is becoming very important these days is proper observability for AI agents, especially when they go into production. Because AI agents are non-deterministic, you really have no idea what's going on under the hood. If there is latency, errors, incorrect tool calls, or even tool call loops, its very hard to know that its happening and what's causing these issues without proper observability in your AI stack. \n\nI would highly suggest looking into OpenTelemetry. It's the open source standard for observability and supports wide variety of languages and frameworks. Also, it's used for general application related telemetry as well, so you would be able to monitor your AI usage + your entire application as well, with the same framework. Additionally, because it's open source, OpenTelemetry is vendor neutral, allowing you to choose from a wide variety of OpenTelemetry compatible observability platforms, and making plug and play super straightforward.",

Because LLMs are non-deterministic, it is very hard to \"see\" whats going on under the hood between the user input and llm output. Especially when you deal with AI agents, many things can go wrong like high latency, incorrect tool calls, agent loops, tool errors, and muhc more. Without observability you're basically flying blind and it's very tough to actually gain visiblity into what's happening and what's causing specific things to degrade. \n\n  \nWith that being said, I think OpenTelemetry is the way to go, as the open source standard for observability. There are many libraries using OpenTelemetry that you can use to instrument many popular AI provider and frameworks these days like OpenInference, Traceloop, Langtrace, and OpenLIT. What makes OpenTelemetry great is it's open source aspect, allowing you to choose any vendor you want. As long as you use a OpenTelemetry compatible backend, the plug and play into your existing AI stack is very straightforward, with little to no code change. \n\n\\-",

For budgeting it's better to have a rough estimate of how much no input and output tokens roughly used in the entire end to end call. Once we know this we can set some hard capped limits in the llm initialisation. For validation the first step is simply start to validate with ground truth tool call traces vs inference tool call traces.

However, I have noticed that it actually refers to two fundamentally different concepts.\n\n1. Agent as an abstraction over an LLM call\n\nIn this model, an agent is essentially a wrapper around an LLM invocation. It is defined by a unique role and a contract for input and output data.\n\nSuch agents do not have a decision loop. They usually provide simple request–response behavior, similar to an API endpoint.\n\n2. Autonomous code agents\n\nExamples include Claude Code, OpenCode, and similar tools. These agents can not only generate code, but also execute tasks and coordinate complex workflows.\n\nThe key difference is that they have their own decision loop. They can plan, act, observe results, and continue working autonomously until a goal is achieved.\n\n\\---\n\nBuilding a multi-agent system composed of agents of the first type is not particularly interesting to me. It is primarily an integration problem.\n\nWhile it is possible to design non-trivial architectures, such as:\n\n\\- agent graphs with or without loops,\n\n\\- routing or pathfinding logic to select the minimal set of agents required to solve a task,\n\nthe agents themselves remain passive and reactive.\n\nWhat I truly want to understand is how to build systems composed of autonomous agents that operate inside their own decision loops and perform real work independently.\n\nThat is the part of multi-agent systems I am trying to learn. \n\nWelcome any comments on the topics.",

          "text": "Most multi-agent examples I’ve seen online are really role-based LLM calls stitched together. They’re useful, but as you said that’s mostly an integration/orchestration problem. The agents don’t decide, they’re invoked. Autonomous agents are a different beast. The defining feature isn’t that they call tools, it’s that they own a control loop: goal → plan → act → observe → update state → repeat. Once you do that, the hard problems stop being prompts and start being systems problems: state management, stopping conditions, failure recovery, credit assignment, and coordination between loops.\n\nA few patterns that show up in real autonomous multi-agent systems:\n- Explicit internal state: each agent has its own persistent state (goals, assumptions, progress), not just shared context.\n- Bounded autonomy: agents don’t free-run forever; they operate inside constraints (budgets, max steps, human checkpoints).\n- Communication as messages, not prompts: agents exchange structured messages/events, often asynchronously, rather than sharing giant contexts.\n- Task ownership: one agent owns a goal and decides when to ask others for help, instead of a central router deciding everything.\n- Failure as a first-class outcome: agents are allowed to say “I’m stuck,” escalate, or back off… otherwise loops collapse into thrashing.\n\nFramework-wise, this is why things like LangGraph, AutoGPT-style planners, or workflow engines + agents exist: not to make agents smarter, but to make decision loops survivable. The intelligence comes from how you bound and coordinate those loops, not from adding more agents.\n\nA good exercise is to build one autonomous agent that can run for hours, survive restarts, and explain what it’s doing. Then add a second agent and make coordination the problem. The learning is in the doing",

          "text": "Yeah I think it’s best not to rely on a single long-running loop. I’d make the agent replayable: persist state after each step (or after each tool call), give every step an idempotency key, and design it so you can resume from step 7 without guessing what happened. That can be as simple as writing a state blob + events to Postgres, or as structured as an event-sourced log.\n\nAlso it helps to think of the agent as more of a workflow vs. a process. The runtime can crash, but the workflow keeps going because the next step is driven by stored state + a queue/worker, not by one fragile thread. Timeouts become normal - retry with backoff, or fall back to a human/handoff state.\n\nSo I’d hope most serious teams aren’t hoping the connection stays stable. They’re either using a workflow engine pattern (queue + persisted state) or adopting frameworks that give you durable execution semantics. If you have a minimal setup: Postgres for state, a job queue for steps, and strict logging of tool calls is already enough to get you a decent amount of durability.",
