Last night I thought: why not tackle something massive?\n\nTook the Epstein Files dataset from Hugging Face (teyler/epstein-files-20k) – 2 million+ pages of trending news and documents. The cleaning, chunking, and optimization challenges are exactly what excites me.\n\nWhat I built:\n\n\\- Full RAG pipeline with optimized data processing\n\n\\- Processed 2M+ pages (cleaning, chunking, vectorization)\n\n\\- Semantic search & Q&A over massive dataset\n\n\\- Constantly tweaking for better retrieval & performance\n\n\\- Python, MIT Licensed, open source\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nIt’s trending, real-world data at scale, the perfect playground.\n\nWhen you operate at scale, every optimization matters.

      "text": "Hey r/LangChain 👋\n\nI built **Fractal Context** — a LangGraph implementation of Recursive Language Models that solves the \"context rot\" problem by letting an LLM **recursively spawn child agents** to process large text.\n\n**The problem:** When you stuff a massive document into an LLM, attention degrades — details in the middle get \"forgotten\" and the model starts hallucinating. This is context rot.\n\n**The solution:** Instead of cramming everything into one prompt, the parent agent:\n\n1. Evaluates if the context is too large\n2. Uses a Python REPL to slice the text into chunks\n3. Calls `delegate_subtask`  to spawn a **child agent** at `depth + 1`\n4. Each child processes its chunk and reports back\n5. The parent synthesizes all answers\n\nThe recursion is depth-limited to prevent runaway chains.\n\n**The \"Glass Box\" UI:** Built with Chainlit, the UI shows nested steps in real-time so you can actually *see* the recursion happening:\n\n* 🧠 **Thinking…** — LLM reasoning (token by token)\n* 💻 **Coding…** — when the agent writes Python to slice text\n* 🔀 **Sub-Agent (Depth N)** — child agents spawning and reporting\n\n**Tech stack:**\n\n* LangGraph (StateGraph with conditional edges)\n* LangChain + Groq API (Llama 3.3 70B)\n* Chainlit for the UI\n* Python 3.11+\n\n**Repo:** [github.com/Dolphin-Syndrom/fractal-context](https://github.com/Dolphin-Syndrom/fractal-context)\n\n",

Single explanation gets split across two chunks. Tables lose their structure. Headers separate from data. The chunks going into your vector DB are semantically incoherent.\n\nI've been testing semantic boundary detection instead where I use a model to find where topics actually change. Generate embeddings for each sentence, calculate similarity between consecutive ones, split when it sees sharp drops. The results are variable chunks but each represents a complete clear idea.\n\nThis alone gets 2-3 percentage points better recall but the bigger win for me was adding metadata. I pass each chunk through an LLM to extract time periods, doc types, entities, whatever structured info matters and store that alongside the embedding.\n\nThis metadata filters narrow the search space first, then vector similarity runs on that subset. Searching 47 relevant chunks instead of 20,000 random ones.\n\nFor complex documents with inherent structure this seems obviously better than fixed chunking. Anyway thought I should share. :)",

Model-side “be careful” prompting is not a reliable control once tools are involved.\n\nSo I open-sourced GuardLLM, a small Python “security middleware” for tool-calling LLM apps:\n\n* Inbound hardening: isolate and sanitize untrusted text so it is treated as data, not instructions.\n* Tool-call firewall: gate destructive tools behind explicit authorization and fail-closed human confirmation.\n* Request binding: bind tool calls (tool + canonical args + message hash + TTL) to prevent replay and arg substitution.\n* Exfiltration detection: secret-pattern scanning plus overlap checks against recently ingested untrusted content.\n* Provenance tracking: stricter no-copy rules for known-untrusted spans.\n* Canary tokens: generation and detection to catch prompt leakage into outputs.\n* Source gating: reduce memory/KG poisoning by blocking high-risk sources from promotion.\n\nIt is intentionally application-layer: it does not replace least-privilege credentials or sandboxing; it sits above them.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/mhcoen/guardllm](https://github.com/mhcoen/guardllm)\n\nI’d like feedback on:\n\n* Threat model gaps I missed\n* Whether the default overlap thresholds work for real summarization and quoting workflows\n* Which framework adapters would be most useful (LangChain, OpenAI tool calling, MCP proxy, etc.)",

      "text": "That discussion about MCPs being outdated and agents moving toward raw CLI access sent me down a rabbit hole I wasn't expecting. Been experimenting with OpenClaw recently (hard to ignore 160K stars) and saw someone in the GitHub issues flag a calendar integration skill that was requesting file system write access and network permissions for something that should just be reading a schedule. They dug into the code and found base64 encoded strings that decoded to external URLs and some sketchy eval statements. Maintainer removed it pretty quick but it had already been up for a few days.\n\nStarted googling after reading that thread and honestly got a bit worried. Apparently a decent chunk of community built skills have been flagged for doing sketchy things like data collection or downloading external payloads. Can't verify the exact numbers myself but it tracks with what I've been seeing in issue trackers. OpenClaw's own docs call the whole setup a \"Faustian bargain\" which... yeah.\n\nFeels like we're repeating the npm left-pad era except now the stakes are higher because these agents have real permissions. Read your emails, browse authenticated pages, execute shell commands. One bad skill and you've basically handed over the keys.\n\nSo now I'm being paranoid about everything. Manual code review when I have patience for it, though I'm slow at spotting obfuscated stuff. Checking GitHub issues and recent commits before installing anything. Running everything in Docker with network monitoring just in case. I've tried throwing Semgrep at some skills with mixed results, poked around with Snyk and Agent Trust Hub too. Even grep for obvious patterns like base64 or eval. The automated scanners all feel like security theater though when you're dealing with prompt injection vectors they weren't really designed for.\n\nStarting to think the only real answer is extreme permission isolation but that defeats half the usefulness of these agents. There's probably no good solution here.\n\nWhat does your vetting process look like before installing community stuff? Or is the general approach to just run everything sandboxed and hope for the best?",

      "text": "Been setting up OpenClaw for a side project (local automation stuff, nothing crazy) and the recent thread about MCPs being outdated got me thinking about the actual security posture of what I'm running. Did some digging and found research from Gen Threat Labs that honestly made me reconsider my setup.\n\nThe big one: over 18,000 OpenClaw instances are currently exposed to the public internet. That's not instances running locally as intended, that's port 18789 sitting open for anyone to poke at. Given that these agents often have filesystem access, shell execution, and credentials to various services, that's a lot of attack surface just sitting there. Made me immediately go check my own firewall rules.\n\nThe other number that stood out: their analysis claims nearly 15% of community skills contain malicious instructions. Now I'm genuinely not sure how they verified that or what threshold they used for \"malicious\" so take it with some salt. But even if the real number is half that it's pretty concerning. Apparently when bad skills get flagged and removed from ClawHub they frequently reappear under different names which tracks with what I've seen in other package ecosystems.\n\nHonestly the OpenClaw FAQ itself is refreshingly blunt about this being a \"Faustian bargain\" with no \"perfectly safe\" setup. The power comes from deep system access which is exactly what creates the exposure. I respect the transparency but it does make me reconsider how casually I've been treating this stuff. I had my instance connected to my actual email for testing which in retrospect was pretty dumb.\n\nThe concept that stuck with me is what the research called \"delegated compromise\" where attackers don't need to target you directly, they just compromise the agent and inherit whatever permissions you gave it. Obvious in hindsight but I hadn't really thought about my agents as high value targets in their own right. That realization is what finally got me to actually change my setup instead of just thinking \"I should probably fix this eventually.\"\n\nI've since moved everything into a Docker container with network set to none except when I explicitly need external access, and stripped permissions down to just filesystem read on a single project directory mounted as a volume. No email, no shell execution, no browser. Basically treating it like I would any random npm package from an unknown author.\n\nWhat security practices are others here using? Curious whether people are actually running these in isolated environments or just going full send on their dev machines. For those who do vet skills before installing, what does your workflow look like? I've seen a few scanner tools floating around (something called Agent Trust Hub and a couple others) but haven't tried any yet and manually reviewing every skill is getting tedious.",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nI have two announcements related to [Kreuzberg](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg):\n\n1. We released our new [comparative benchmarks](https://kreuzberg.dev/benchmarks). These have a slick UI and we have been working hard on them for a while now (more on this below), and we'd love to hear your impressions and get some feedback from the community!\n2. We released v4.3.0, which brings in a bunch of improvements including PaddleOCR as an optional backend, document structure extraction, and native Word97 format support. More details below.\n\n# What is Kreuzberg?\n\n[Kreuzberg](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg) is an open-source (MIT license) polyglot document intelligence framework written in Rust, with bindings for Python, TypeScript/JavaScript (Node/Bun/WASM), PHP, Ruby, Java, C#, Golang and Elixir. It's also available as a docker image and standalone CLI tool you can install via homebrew.\n\nIf the above is unintelligible to you (understandably so), here is the TL;DR: Kreuzberg allows users to extract text from 75+ formats (and growing), perform OCR, create embeddings and quite a few other things as well. This is necessary for many AI applications, data pipelines, machine learning, and basically any use case where you need to process documents and images as sources for textual outputs.\n\n# Comparative Benchmarks\n\nOur new comparative benchmarks UI is live here: [https://kreuzberg.dev/benchmarks](https://kreuzberg.dev/benchmarks)\n\nThe comparative benchmarks compare Kreuzberg with several of the top open source alternatives - Apache Tika, Docling, Markitdown, [Unstructured.io](http://Unstructured.io), PDFPlumber, Mineru, MuPDF4LLM. In a nutshell - Kreuzberg is 9x faster on average, uses substantially less memory, has much better cold start, and a smaller installation footprint. It also requires less system dependencies to function (only **optional** system dependency for it is onnxruntime, for embeddings/PaddleOCR).\n\nThe benchmarks measure throughput, duration, p99/95/50, memory, installation size and cold start with more than 50 different file formats. They are run in GitHub CI on ubuntu latest machines and the results are published into GitHub releases (here is an [example](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/releases/tag/benchmark-run-21923145045)). The [source code](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/tree/main/tools/benchmark-harness) for the benchmarks and the full data is available in GitHub, and you are invited to check it out.\n\n# V4.3.0 Changes\n\nThe v4.3.0 full release notes can be found here: [https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/releases/tag/v4.3.0](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/releases/tag/v4.3.0)\n\nKey highlights:\n\n1. PaddleOCR optional backend - in Rust. Yes, you read this right, Kreuzberg now supports PaddleOCR in Rust and by extension - across all languages and bindings except WASM. This is a big one, especially for Chinese speakers and other east Asian languages, at which these models excel.\n2. Document structure extraction - while we already had page hierarchy extraction, we had requests to give document structure extraction similar to Docling, which has very good extraction. We now have a different but up to par implementation that extracts document structure from a huge variety of text documents - yes, including PDFs.\n3. Native Word97 format extraction - wait, what? Yes, we now support the legacy `.doc` and `.ppt` formats directly in Rust. This means we no longer need LibreOffice as an optional system dependency, which saves a lot of space. Who cares you may ask? Well, usually enterprises and governmental orgs to be honest, but we still live in a world where legacy is a thing.\n\n# How to get involved with Kreuzberg\n\n* Kreuzberg is an open-source project, and as such contributions are welcome. You can check us out on GitHub, open issues or discussions, and of course submit fixes and pull requests. Here is the GitHub: [https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg)\n* We have a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rzGzur3kj4) and you are all invited to join (and lurk)!\n\nThat's it for now. As always, if you like it -- star it on GitHub, it helps us get visibility!",

      "text": "Building an agent that needs to reason over email data and wanted to share what the actual infrastructure requirement looks like, because it was way more than I expected.\n\nThe model/reasoning part is straightforward. The hard part is everything before the prompt:\n\n1. OAuth flows per email provider, per user, with token refresh\n2. Thread reconstruction (nested replies, forwarded messages, quoted text stripping, CC/BCC parsing)\n3. Incremental sync so you're not reprocessing full inboxes\n4. Per-user data isolation if you have multiple users\n5. Cross-thread retrieval, because the answer to most work questions spans multiple conversations\n6. Structured extraction into typed JSON, not prose summaries\n\nOne thing I noticed when running dozens of tests with different models (I used threads with 20+ emails, with 4 or 5 different threads per prompt), is that the thread reconstruction is a completely different problem per provider. \n\nGmail gives you threadId but the message ordering and quoted text handling is inconsistent. Outlook threads differently, and forwarded messages break both. If you're building this yourself, don't assume a universal parser will work.\n\nWe built an API that handles all of this (igpt.ai) because we couldn't find anything that did it well. \n\nOne endpoint, you pass a user ID and a query and get back structured JSON with the context already assembled. \n\n",

That definitely creates retry loops. In those cases improving the data layer can solve the root issue.\n\nWhat I’m trying to look at here is a slightly different class of loops. I’ve seen systems loop even when the data is clean, just because there’s no clear “done” condition, or agents keep optimizing instead of converging, or the planner state doesn’t reflect real progress. Sometimes two agents just implicitly disagree on whether the task is complete.\n\nSo I see Watchtower more as a runtime guardrail than a fix for bad tools. It doesn’t replace improving data quality, but it can surface pathological behavior early, regardless of the cause.\n\nOut of curiosity, in your experience were most loops purely data-quality issues, or did you also see coordination-level ones?",

      "text": "I built an open-source memory system for AI agents with a different approach to knowledge extraction.\n\nThe problem: Most memory systems extract every fact from conversations and rely on retrieval to sort out what matters. This leads to noisy knowledge bases full of redundant information.\n\nThe approach: memv uses predict-calibrate extraction (based on the [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03341](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03341)). Before extracting knowledge from a new conversation, it predicts what the episode should contain given existing knowledge. Only facts that were unpredicted — the prediction errors — get stored. Importance emerges from surprise, not upfront LLM scoring.\n\nOther things worth mentioning:\n\n* Bi-temporal model — every fact tracks both when it was true in the world (event time) and when you learned it (transaction time). You can query \"what did we know about this user in January?\"\n* Hybrid retrieval — vector similarity (sqlite-vec) + BM25 text search (FTS5), fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion\n* Contradiction handling — new facts automatically invalidate conflicting old ones, but full history is preserved\n* SQLite default — zero external dependencies, no Postgres/Redis/Pinecone needed\n* Framework agnostic — works with LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, or plain Python\n\n\n```python\n    from memv import Memory\n    from memv.embeddings import OpenAIEmbedAdapter\n    from memv.llm import PydanticAIAdapter\n    \n    memory = Memory(\n        db_path=\"memory.db\",\n        embedding_client=OpenAIEmbedAdapter(),\n        llm_client=PydanticAIAdapter(\"openai:gpt-4o-mini\"),\n    )\n    \n    async with memory:\n        await memory.add_exchange(\n            user_id=\"user-123\",\n            user_message=\"I just started at Anthropic as a researcher.\",\n            assistant_message=\"Congrats! What's your focus area?\",\n        )\n        await memory.process(\"user-123\")\n        result = await memory.retrieve(\"What does the user do?\", user_id=\"user-123\")\n```\n\nMIT licensed.

Here’s what typically happens when taking LangChain from prototype to production:\nThe Core Architecture Question\nMost teams actually do keep LangChain in production, but the architecture often evolves significantly. It usually stays as the orchestration layer, but gets wrapped in more infrastructure. Some teams eventually migrate to lighter alternatives if they find they’re only using basic chain logic, but this tends to happen gradually rather than as a planned replacement.\nTypical Production Steps\nInfrastructure additions:\n- Moving from simple chains to LangGraph for more complex, stateful workflows with better control flow\n- Adding proper API layers (FastAPI/Flask) around your chains\n- Implementing request queuing and rate limiting\n- Setting up proper database connections for conversation history and state management\nObservability stack:\n- LangSmith for tracing and debugging (LangChain’s native tool)\n- Structured logging with correlation IDs across chain steps\n- Custom metrics for latency, token usage, and success rates per chain component\n- Error tracking (Sentry or similar) with LangChain-specific context\nProduction hardening:\n- Implementing retries with exponential backoff for LLM calls\n- Adding circuit breakers for external services\n- Prompt versioning and A/B testing infrastructure\n- Input validation and output sanitization\n- Cost tracking per user/request\nCommon “Do This Early” Advice\n- Set up tracing from day one - You’ll need it to debug chain behavior, and retrofitting is painful\n- Design for prompt iteration - Store prompts in config/database, not hardcoded\n- Plan your state management - Conversation memory gets complex quickly with multiple users\n- Implement proper error boundaries - LangChain errors can be cryptic; wrap components with clear error handling\nCommon “Can Wait” Items\n- Highly optimized caching strategies\n- Custom chain implementations (start with LangChain’s built-ins)\n- Complex multi-agent systems (unless core to your use case)\nThe biggest shift is often moving from LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) chains to LangGraph when you need more complex control flow, error recovery, or human-in-the-loop patterns.",

Start with just the tool-calling loop... send a prompt, parse the function call, execute it, feed the result back, repeat until the model stops requesting tools. That's the entire skeleton.\n\nOnce that works, the next unlock is separating planning from execution. Have the model output a plan first, then execute each step. Without that split, anything beyond 2-3 tools falls apart because the model loses track of where it is.\n\nAnthropic's engineering blog and OpenAI's practical guide to building agents PDF both walk through this architecture. For interview prep specifically, being able to explain why you'd add memory, retry logic, or a supervisor pattern on top of that bare loop is more valuable than knowing any specific framework's API.",

While AmenLink focuses on spiritual AI assistance rather than AI agent development courses, I can offer some general advice from the tech world perspective that might be helpful. For practical, hands-on learning in AI agent frameworks, I'd suggest looking into:\n\n\n\n1.  Official documentation and examples from libraries like LangChain or LlamaIndex. They often have solid tutorials that walk you through building components like tool use, planning, and memory.\n\n2.  YouTube channels that focus on MLOps, AI engineering, or specific framework tutorials. Many independent creators offer deep dives into building custom agents.\n\n3.  Udemy/Coursera often have courses specifically on \"building AI agents\" or \"LLM application development\" which would cover your listed interests like orchestration and evaluation. Look for courses with high ratings and recent updates.\n\n4.  For multi-agent systems, research papers and their accompanying open-source implementations are gold. Platforms like Hugging Face often host these projects.\n\n\n\nMany learned by just jumping in, building small projects, and debugging their way through. Good luck with your learning journey – it's a fascinating field!",

The TL;DR was that heavy MCP servers like Linear, GitHub, Figma etc. were eating 25% of my context window before I even asked a question.\n\nI built MCPlexor to solve this – it dynamically routes to the right MCP server instead of dumping 100+ tool definitions into your agent's context.\n\n**What's new: Full Ollama Support**\n\nI kept getting asked: \"Can I run this locally without calling your API?\"\n\nShort answer: yes, now you can.\n\nIf you have Ollama running, MCPlexor can use it for the routing logic instead of our cloud. Zero cost, works offline, your data stays on localhost.\n\non localhost.\n\n    # Install\n    curl -fsSL https://mcplexor.com/install.sh | bash\n\nIn MCPlexor cli you can use your local Ollama instance (llama3, mistral, qwen, whatever you've got) to figure out which MCP server to route to.\n\n**How MCPlexor will eventually make money**\n\nFigured I'd be transparent since I'm indie-hacking this:\n\nFor local/low-volume users → Ollama is free. Use it if you have many mcps on for you agent. Seriously.\n\nFor high-volume / cloud users → We run the routing on cheaper, efficient models (not Opus or Gemini Pro). We take a small cut from the savings we're passing on. Think of it as: you were gonna spend $X on context tokens anyway, we help you spend $X/10, and we take a slice of the difference.\n\nHaven't launched the paid tier yet (still in waitlist mode), but that's the game plan.",
