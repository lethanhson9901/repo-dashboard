      "text": "Agent UIs in LangChain / LangGraph usually start simple: stream final text, maybe echo some logs. But as soon as the goal is real interactivity: step‑level progress, visible tool calls, shared state, retries - the frontend ends up with a custom event schema tightly coupled to the backend.\n\nI have been digging into the AG‑UI (Agent-User Interaction Protocol) which is trying to standardize that layer. It defines a typed event stream that any agent backend can emit and any UI can consume. Instead of “whatever JSON is on the WebSocket” -- there is a small set of event kinds with clear semantics.\n\nAG-UI is not a UI framework and not a model API -- it’s basically the contract between an agent runtime and the UI layer. It groups all the events into core high-level categories:\n\n* Lifecycle: `RunStarted`, `RunFinished`, `RunError`, plus optional `StepStarted` / `StepFinished` that map nicely onto LangGraph nodes or LangChain tool/chain steps.\n* Text streaming: `TextMessageStart`, `TextMessageContent`, `TextMessageEnd` (and a chunk variant) for incremental LLM output.\n* Tool calls: `ToolCallStart`, `ToolCallArgs`, `ToolCallEnd`, `ToolCallResult` so UIs can render tools as first‑class elements instead of log lines.\n* State management: `StateSnapshot` and `StateDelta` (JSON Patch) for synchronizing shared graph/application state, with `MessagesSnapshot` available to resync after reconnects.\n* Special events: custom events in case an interaction doesn’t fit any of the categories above\n\nEach event has a `type` (such as `TextMessageContent`) plus a payload. There are other properties (like `runId`, `threadId`) that are specific to the event type.   \n  \nBecause the stream is standard and ordered, the frontend can reliably interpret what the backend is doing\n\nThe protocol is **transport‑agnostic**: SSE, WebSockets, or HTTP chunked responses can all carry the same event envelope. If a backend emits an AG‑UI‑compatible event stream (or you add a thin adapter), the frontend wiring can stay largely the same across different agent runtimes.\n\nFor people building agents: curious whether this maps cleanly onto the events you are already logging or streaming today, or if there are gaps.  \n  \n[Events docs](https://docs.ag-ui.com/concepts/events)  \nrepo: [https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui)",

          "text": "Protocol standardization is useful but doesn't solve the production debugging problem.\n\nStandard event stream helps UI consistency, but when your agent makes a wrong decision, can you reconstruct what it saw? `ToolCallStart` \\+ `ToolCallResult` show what happened, but not what data the tool returned, how fresh it was, or why the agent chose this tool over others.\n\nThe real production gap: evidence capture, not event standardization. When tool call 47 at 3am returns wrong data, you need content lineage (what was retrieved), policy decisions (was this action authorized), and regression fixtures (how to prevent this after model update).\n\nAG-UI events are ephemeral UI updates. Incident debugging needs durable, verifiable records. `StateSnapshot` helps resume execution but doesn't prove what data informed decisions or help debug why behavior changed between runs.\n\nFor production agents: are you capturing decision context (retrieval results, policy evaluations, input data) separately from UI events? Or assuming event logs are enough for post-incident analysis?\n\nStandard protocols are good for interop. Evidence infrastructure is what makes agents debuggable at scale.",

But on its own, that's clearly not sufficient for incident debugging\n\nwe would still need durable traces like LangSmith-style runs, retrieval snapshots, policy decisions.

Quality will keep improving as the models get better.\n\nyou're 100% right and we're actively working on this. The onboarding has too many steps right now. Goal is: install the plugin → connect → start chatting. We're cutting it down.\n\nhonestly it's less than you'd think. The agent is smart about batching operations and only calls the reasoning model when it actually needs to make a decision. Most of the \"thinking\" steps are lightweight. The long runtime is mostly Blender executing the code, not the AI burning tokens. The output are short mostly short.\n\nThe high level is: we use a planning agent that breaks the task into stages, another ones comes to reason and think in \"3D/Spatial Math\" then an execution agent handles each stage in a loop (perceive scene → decide next action → execute code → verify via viewport). The key insight was adding the verification step... without it the agent drifts and you get garbage. There's a router in between that decides when to escalate to the reasoning model vs handle it with a faster/cheaper one. Would love to do a deeper write-up at some point once we've solidified the architecture more.\n\nWhat's your background? You sound like you're building agents yourself ",

The orchestrator can die and come back because it only reads registry plus current task state.\n- Execution as durable jobs.

Did some digging and found research from Gen Threat Labs that honestly made me reconsider my setup.\n\nThe big one: over 18,000 OpenClaw instances are currently exposed to the public internet. That's not instances running locally as intended, that's port 18789 sitting open for anyone to poke at. Given that these agents often have filesystem access, shell execution, and credentials to various services, that's a lot of attack surface just sitting there. Made me immediately go check my own firewall rules.\n\nThe other number that stood out: their analysis claims nearly 15% of community skills contain malicious instructions. Now I'm genuinely not sure how they verified that or what threshold they used for \"malicious\" so take it with some salt. But even if the real number is half that it's pretty concerning. Apparently when bad skills get flagged and removed from ClawHub they frequently reappear under different names which tracks with what I've seen in other package ecosystems.\n\nHonestly the OpenClaw FAQ itself is refreshingly blunt about this being a \"Faustian bargain\" with no \"perfectly safe\" setup. The power comes from deep system access which is exactly what creates the exposure. I respect the transparency but it does make me reconsider how casually I've been treating this stuff. I had my instance connected to my actual email for testing which in retrospect was pretty dumb.\n\nThe concept that stuck with me is what the research called \"delegated compromise\" where attackers don't need to target you directly, they just compromise the agent and inherit whatever permissions you gave it. Obvious in hindsight but I hadn't really thought about my agents as high value targets in their own right. That realization is what finally got me to actually change my setup instead of just thinking \"I should probably fix this eventually.\"\n\nI've since moved everything into a Docker container with network set to none except when I explicitly need external access, and stripped permissions down to just filesystem read on a single project directory mounted as a volume. No email, no shell execution, no browser. Basically treating it like I would any random npm package from an unknown author.\n\nWhat security practices are others here using? Curious whether people are actually running these in isolated environments or just going full send on their dev machines. For those who do vet skills before installing, what does your workflow look like? I've seen a few scanner tools floating around (something called Agent Trust Hub and a couple others) but haven't tried any yet and manually reviewing every skill is getting tedious.",

      "text": "Building an agent that needs to reason over email data and wanted to share what the actual infrastructure requirement looks like, because it was way more than I expected.\n\nThe model/reasoning part is straightforward. The hard part is everything before the prompt:\n\n1. OAuth flows per email provider, per user, with token refresh\n2. Thread reconstruction (nested replies, forwarded messages, quoted text stripping, CC/BCC parsing)\n3. Incremental sync so you're not reprocessing full inboxes\n4. Per-user data isolation if you have multiple users\n5. Cross-thread retrieval, because the answer to most work questions spans multiple conversations\n6. Structured extraction into typed JSON, not prose summaries\n\nOne thing I noticed when running dozens of tests with different models (I used threads with 20+ emails, with 4 or 5 different threads per prompt), is that the thread reconstruction is a completely different problem per provider. \n\nGmail gives you threadId but the message ordering and quoted text handling is inconsistent. Outlook threads differently, and forwarded messages break both. If you're building this yourself, don't assume a universal parser will work.\n\nWe built an API that handles all of this (igpt.ai) because we couldn't find anything that did it well. \n\nOne endpoint, you pass a user ID and a query and get back structured JSON with the context already assembled. \n\n",

I wrote a step-by-step tutorial.\n\nYour code is the source of truth, and documentations out of sync is such a common pain especially in larger teams. Someone refactors a module, and the wiki is already wrong. Nobody updates it until a new engineer asks a question about it.\n\nThis open source project scans your codebases, extracts structured information with LLMs, and generates Markdown documentation with Mermaid diagrams — using CocoIndex + Instructor + Pydantic.\n\nWhat's cool about this example:\n\n• 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 — Only changed files get reprocessed. saving 90%+ of LLM cost and compute.\n\n• 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐬 — LLM returns real typed objects — classes, functions, signatures, relationships.\n\n• 𝐀𝐬𝐲𝐧𝐜 𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 — All files in a project get extracted concurrently with asyncio.gather().\n\n• 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐝 𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐬 — Auto-generated pipeline visualizations showing how your functions connect across the project.\n\nThis pattern hooks naturally into PR flows — run it on every merge and your docs stay current without anyone thinking about it. I think it would be cool next to build a coding agent with Langchain on top of this fresh knowledge. \n\nIf you want to explore the full example (fully open source, with code, APACHE 2.0), it's here:\n\n👉 [https://cocoindex.io/examples-v1/multi-codebase-summarization](https://cocoindex.io/examples-v1/multi-codebase-summarization)\n\nIf you find CocoIndex useful, a star on Github means a lot :)\n\n⭐ [https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex)\n\ni'd love to learn from your feedback, thanks!",

Here’s what typically happens when taking LangChain from prototype to production:\nThe Core Architecture Question\nMost teams actually do keep LangChain in production, but the architecture often evolves significantly. It usually stays as the orchestration layer, but gets wrapped in more infrastructure. Some teams eventually migrate to lighter alternatives if they find they’re only using basic chain logic, but this tends to happen gradually rather than as a planned replacement.\nTypical Production Steps\nInfrastructure additions:\n- Moving from simple chains to LangGraph for more complex, stateful workflows with better control flow\n- Adding proper API layers (FastAPI/Flask) around your chains\n- Implementing request queuing and rate limiting\n- Setting up proper database connections for conversation history and state management\nObservability stack:\n- LangSmith for tracing and debugging (LangChain’s native tool)\n- Structured logging with correlation IDs across chain steps\n- Custom metrics for latency, token usage, and success rates per chain component\n- Error tracking (Sentry or similar) with LangChain-specific context\nProduction hardening:\n- Implementing retries with exponential backoff for LLM calls\n- Adding circuit breakers for external services\n- Prompt versioning and A/B testing infrastructure\n- Input validation and output sanitization\n- Cost tracking per user/request\nCommon “Do This Early” Advice\n- Set up tracing from day one - You’ll need it to debug chain behavior, and retrofitting is painful\n- Design for prompt iteration - Store prompts in config/database, not hardcoded\n- Plan your state management - Conversation memory gets complex quickly with multiple users\n- Implement proper error boundaries - LangChain errors can be cryptic; wrap components with clear error handling\nCommon “Can Wait” Items\n- Highly optimized caching strategies\n- Custom chain implementations (start with LangChain’s built-ins)\n- Complex multi-agent systems (unless core to your use case)\nThe biggest shift is often moving from LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) chains to LangGraph when you need more complex control flow, error recovery, or human-in-the-loop patterns.",

The TL;DR was that heavy MCP servers like Linear, GitHub, Figma etc. were eating 25% of my context window before I even asked a question.\n\nI built MCPlexor to solve this – it dynamically routes to the right MCP server instead of dumping 100+ tool definitions into your agent's context.\n\n**What's new: Full Ollama Support**\n\nI kept getting asked: \"Can I run this locally without calling your API?\"\n\nShort answer: yes, now you can.\n\nIf you have Ollama running, MCPlexor can use it for the routing logic instead of our cloud. Zero cost, works offline, your data stays on localhost.\n\non localhost.\n\n    # Install\n    curl -fsSL https://mcplexor.com/install.sh | bash\n\nIn MCPlexor cli you can use your local Ollama instance (llama3, mistral, qwen, whatever you've got) to figure out which MCP server to route to.\n\n**How MCPlexor will eventually make money**\n\nFigured I'd be transparent since I'm indie-hacking this:\n\nFor local/low-volume users → Ollama is free. Use it if you have many mcps on for you agent. Seriously.\n\nFor high-volume / cloud users → We run the routing on cheaper, efficient models (not Opus or Gemini Pro). We take a small cut from the savings we're passing on. Think of it as: you were gonna spend $X on context tokens anyway, we help you spend $X/10, and we take a slice of the difference.\n\nHaven't launched the paid tier yet (still in waitlist mode), but that's the game plan.",

What security concerns do you run into?  \n  \n[https://trustagents.dev](https://trustagents.dev)",

BS4 is fine for static content but if you're targeting JS-heavy sites (SPAs, dynamic dashboards), Playwright is worth the overhead.\n\nthe ChromaDB + Sentence-Transformers + Groq stack is solid for a learning project. if you do make it live, watch out for near-duplicate pages (like paginated content or URL params) polluting your index... a simple content hash before embedding can save you a lot of headaches there.\n\ncool project for 2 months in.",

      "text": "I built an open-source memory system for AI agents with a different approach to knowledge extraction.\n\nThe problem: Most memory systems extract every fact from conversations and rely on retrieval to sort out what matters. This leads to noisy knowledge bases full of redundant information.\n\nThe approach: memv uses predict-calibrate extraction (based on the [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03341](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03341)). Before extracting knowledge from a new conversation, it predicts what the episode should contain given existing knowledge. Only facts that were unpredicted — the prediction errors — get stored. Importance emerges from surprise, not upfront LLM scoring.\n\nOther things worth mentioning:\n\n* Bi-temporal model — every fact tracks both when it was true in the world (event time) and when you learned it (transaction time). You can query \"what did we know about this user in January?\"\n* Hybrid retrieval — vector similarity (sqlite-vec) + BM25 text search (FTS5), fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion\n* Contradiction handling — new facts automatically invalidate conflicting old ones, but full history is preserved\n* SQLite default — zero external dependencies, no Postgres/Redis/Pinecone needed\n* Framework agnostic — works with LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, or plain Python\n\n\n```python\n    from memv import Memory\n    from memv.embeddings import OpenAIEmbedAdapter\n    from memv.llm import PydanticAIAdapter\n    \n    memory = Memory(\n        db_path=\"memory.db\",\n        embedding_client=OpenAIEmbedAdapter(),\n        llm_client=PydanticAIAdapter(\"openai:gpt-4o-mini\"),\n    )\n    \n    async with memory:\n        await memory.add_exchange(\n            user_id=\"user-123\",\n            user_message=\"I just started at Anthropic as a researcher.\",\n            assistant_message=\"Congrats! What's your focus area?\",\n        )\n        await memory.process(\"user-123\")\n        result = await memory.retrieve(\"What does the user do?\", user_id=\"user-123\")\n```\n\nMIT licensed.

It appears outside the parent agent node in the graph view, but if you switch to timeline view you can see it’s created immediately after the Gemini call completes.\n\nFinally, the `should_continue` node decides what to do next; If a tool call was present in the previous model output, it returns the tool name and arguments; otherwise, it returns `_end_` to signal the end of the graph\n\nEdit: I wrote my initial comment based on my langfuse output, but after further inspection I realised it's not fully the same",
