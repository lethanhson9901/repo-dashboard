      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe all love how easy `DirectoryLoader` is in LangChain, but let's be honest: running `.load()` on a massive dataset (2GB+ of PDFs/Docs) is a guaranteed way to get an OOM (Out of Memory) error on a standard machine, since it tries to materialize the full list of Document objects in RAM.\n\nI spent some time refactoring a RAG pipeline to move from a POC to a production-ready architecture capable of ingesting gigabytes of data.\n\n**The Architecture:** Instead of the standard list comprehension, I implemented a **Python Generator pattern (**`yield`**)** wrapping the LangChain loaders.\n\n* **Ingestion:** Custom loop using `DirectoryLoader` but processing files lazily (one by one).\n* **Splitting:** `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with a 200 char overlap (crucial for maintaining context across chunk boundaries).\n* **Embeddings:** Batch processing (groups of 100 chunks) to avoid API timeouts/rate limits with `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` (though `OpenAIEmbeddings` works the same way).\n* **Storage:** `Chroma` with `persist_directory` (writing to disk, not memory).\n\nI recorded a deep dive video explaining the code structure and the specific LangChain classes used: [**https://youtu.be/QR-jTaHik8k?si=l9jibVhdQmh04Eaz**](https://youtu.be/QR-jTaHik8k?si=l9jibVhdQmh04Eaz)\n\nI found that for this volume of data, Chroma works well locally. Has anyone pushed Chroma to 10GB+ or do you usually switch to Pinecone/Weaviate managed services at that point?",

But before jumping to Pinecone or Weaviate, worth asking: how much of that 2GB+ corpus actually gets retrieved? In most RAG pipelines I've seen, 80% of queries hit maybe 5% of the index.\\n\\nTwo paths:\\n\\n1. Tiered indexing: keep hot docs in Chroma, cold docs in cheaper blob storage with on-demand embedding\\n2. Aggressive deduplication + summarization upstream to shrink the actual index size\\n\\nManaged services solve scale, but they don't solve the retrieval quality problem of having too much noise in the index. Sometimes the better move is pruning before scaling.",

      "text": "Agent UIs in LangChain / LangGraph usually start simple: stream final text, maybe echo some logs. But as soon as the goal is real interactivity: step‑level progress, visible tool calls, shared state, retries - the frontend ends up with a custom event schema tightly coupled to the backend.\n\nI have been digging into the AG‑UI (Agent-User Interaction Protocol) which is trying to standardize that layer. It defines a typed event stream that any agent backend can emit and any UI can consume. Instead of “whatever JSON is on the WebSocket” -- there is a small set of event kinds with clear semantics.\n\nAG-UI is not a UI framework and not a model API -- it’s basically the contract between an agent runtime and the UI layer. It groups all the events into core high-level categories:\n\n* Lifecycle: `RunStarted`, `RunFinished`, `RunError`, plus optional `StepStarted` / `StepFinished` that map nicely onto LangGraph nodes or LangChain tool/chain steps.\n* Text streaming: `TextMessageStart`, `TextMessageContent`, `TextMessageEnd` (and a chunk variant) for incremental LLM output.\n* Tool calls: `ToolCallStart`, `ToolCallArgs`, `ToolCallEnd`, `ToolCallResult` so UIs can render tools as first‑class elements instead of log lines.\n* State management: `StateSnapshot` and `StateDelta` (JSON Patch) for synchronizing shared graph/application state, with `MessagesSnapshot` available to resync after reconnects.\n* Special events: custom events in case an interaction doesn’t fit any of the categories above\n\nEach event has a `type` (such as `TextMessageContent`) plus a payload. There are other properties (like `runId`, `threadId`) that are specific to the event type.   \n  \nBecause the stream is standard and ordered, the frontend can reliably interpret what the backend is doing\n\nThe protocol is **transport‑agnostic**: SSE, WebSockets, or HTTP chunked responses can all carry the same event envelope. If a backend emits an AG‑UI‑compatible event stream (or you add a thin adapter), the frontend wiring can stay largely the same across different agent runtimes.\n\nFor people building agents: curious whether this maps cleanly onto the events you are already logging or streaming today, or if there are gaps.  \n  \n[Events docs](https://docs.ag-ui.com/concepts/events)  \nrepo: [https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui)",

When tool call 47 at 3am returns wrong data, you need content lineage (what was retrieved), policy decisions (was this action authorized), and regression fixtures (how to prevent this after model update).\n\nAG-UI events are ephemeral UI updates. Incident debugging needs durable, verifiable records. `StateSnapshot` helps resume execution but doesn't prove what data informed decisions or help debug why behavior changed between runs.\n\nFor production agents: are you capturing decision context (retrieval results, policy evaluations, input data) separately from UI events? Or assuming event logs are enough for post-incident analysis?\n\nStandard protocols are good for interop. Evidence infrastructure is what makes agents debuggable at scale.",

We sample a percentage of traffic with automated judges checking hallucination, instruction adherence, and factual accuracy.

That actually messes up with prompt catching as well .\n\nWhen I actually measured token usage, here’s what it looked like:\n\nSystem instructions: ~7k tokens\nMCP tool defs: ~45–50k tokens\nFirst user message: a few hundred tokens\n\nOn a 200k-context model, that meant ~25% of the context window was gone. Eventually history builds up but this 25% remains consistent. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, in most runs, the agent only ended up using one or two tools, usually the filesystem. Linear, GitHub and Figma were rarely touched.\n\nSo tens of thousands of tokens were effectively dead weight. The minimum you must do is context caching but on long running agents even that gets expensive. Also the history summarization is triggered more often with this setup.\n\nI tried a different approach, don’t inject all MCP tools upfront. Only surface tools after the model signals it needs them.\n\nThe results were pretty consisten, ~25% fewer total agent tokens for every llm call, lower latency, more context for reasoning, and lessed chat history compaction.\n\nI wrapped this pattern into a small project called mcplexor so I wouldn’t keep re-implementing it.

Quality will keep improving as the models get better.\n\nyou're 100% right and we're actively working on this. The onboarding has too many steps right now. Goal is: install the plugin → connect → start chatting. We're cutting it down.\n\nhonestly it's less than you'd think. The agent is smart about batching operations and only calls the reasoning model when it actually needs to make a decision. Most of the \"thinking\" steps are lightweight. The long runtime is mostly Blender executing the code, not the AI burning tokens. The output are short mostly short.\n\nThe high level is: we use a planning agent that breaks the task into stages, another ones comes to reason and think in \"3D/Spatial Math\" then an execution agent handles each stage in a loop (perceive scene → decide next action → execute code → verify via viewport). The key insight was adding the verification step... without it the agent drifts and you get garbage. There's a router in between that decides when to escalate to the reasoning model vs handle it with a faster/cheaper one. Would love to do a deeper write-up at some point once we've solidified the architecture more.\n\nWhat's your background? You sound like you're building agents yourself ",

You have to manually manage calibration datasets (or risk 'lobotomizing' the model).\n2. You have to constantly update Docker containers for vLLM/AutoAWQ/ExLlama as new formats emerge.\n3. **Verification is hard:** You don't have an automated way to prove the quantized model is still accurate without running manual benchmarks.\n\n**The Solution I'm Building:** A managed pipeline that handles the calibration selection + generation (AWQ/GGUF/GPTQ) + **Automated Accuracy Reporting** (showing PPL delta vs FP16).\n\n**The Question:** As an MLOps engineer/CTO, is this a pain point you would pay to automate (e.g., $140/mo to offload the headache)?\n\nOr is maintaining your own vLLM/quantization scripts actually pretty easy once it's set up?",

If data wasn’t touched in 30 days, we moved it to cold storage.\n\nI noticed a weird pattern in the AI space recently: **We are treating Vector Databases like cold storage.**\n\nWe shove 100% of our embeddings into expensive Hot RAM (Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate), even though for many use cases (like Chat History or Seasonal Catalog Search), 90% of that data is rarely queried after a month. It’s like keeping your tax returns from 1990 in your wallet instead of a filing cabinet.\n\nI wanted to see exactly how much money was being wasted, so I wrote a simple open-source CLI tool to audit this.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n1. **Connects** to your index (Pinecone currently supported).\n2. **Probes** random sectors of your vector space to sample metadata.\n3. **Analyzes** the `created_at` or timestamp fields.\n4. **Reports** your \"Stale Rate\" (e.g., \"65% of your vectors haven't been queried in >30 days\") and calculates potential savings if you moved them to S3/Disk.\n\n**The \"Trust\" Part:** I know giving API keys to random tools is a bad idea.\n\n* This script runs **100% locally** on your machine.\n* Your keys never leave your terminal.\n* You can audit the code yourself (it’s just Python).\n\n**Why I built this:** I’m working on a larger library to automate the \"S3 Offloading\" process, but first I wanted to prove that the problem actually exists.\n\nI’d love for you to run it and let me know: **Does your stale rate match what you expected?** I’m seeing \\~90% staleness for Chat Apps and \\~15% for Knowledge Bases.\n\n**Repo here:** [https://github.com/billycph/VectorDBCostSavingInspector](https://github.com/billycph/VectorDBCostSavingInspector)\n\nFeedback welcome!",

I've seen multiple reports (and GitHub issues like #5675 and #1730) from late 2025 indicating that `AsyncPostgresSaver` is incredibly fragile when it comes to connection pooling.\n\nSpecifically, I'm concerned about:\n\n1. **Zero Resilience:** If the underlying pool closes or a connection goes stale, the saver seems to just crash with `PoolClosed` or `OperationalError` rather than attempting a retry or refresh.\n2. **Lifecycle Management:** Sharing a `psycopg_pool` between my application (SQLAlchemy) and LangGraph seems to result in race conditions where LangGraph holds onto references to dead pools.\n\n**My Question:**  \nHas anyone successfully deployed `AsyncPostgresSaver` in a high-load production environment recently (early 2026)? Did the team ever release a native fix for automatic retries/pool recovery, or are you all still writing custom wrappers / separate pool managers to baby the checkpointer?\n\nI'm trying to decide if I should risk using the standard saver or just bite the bullet and write a custom Redis/Postgres implementation from day one.\n\nThanks!

Under load that's asking for trouble.

So I wanted to ask directly: what projects would you recommend building that are actually useful and help someone stand out?\n\nI’m not looking for generic or cliché advice, but rather insights from people with hands-on experience in the industry.\n\nThanks a lot for your time.I really appreciate any suggestions.",

I wrote a step-by-step tutorial.\n\nYour code is the source of truth, and documentations out of sync is such a common pain especially in larger teams. Someone refactors a module, and the wiki is already wrong. Nobody updates it until a new engineer asks a question about it.\n\nThis open source project scans your codebases, extracts structured information with LLMs, and generates Markdown documentation with Mermaid diagrams — using CocoIndex + Instructor + Pydantic.\n\nWhat's cool about this example:\n\n• 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 — Only changed files get reprocessed. saving 90%+ of LLM cost and compute.\n\n• 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐋𝐋𝐌𝐬 — LLM returns real typed objects — classes, functions, signatures, relationships.\n\n• 𝐀𝐬𝐲𝐧𝐜 𝐟𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 — All files in a project get extracted concurrently with asyncio.gather().\n\n• 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐝 𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐬 — Auto-generated pipeline visualizations showing how your functions connect across the project.\n\nThis pattern hooks naturally into PR flows — run it on every merge and your docs stay current without anyone thinking about it. I think it would be cool next to build a coding agent with Langchain on top of this fresh knowledge. \n\nIf you want to explore the full example (fully open source, with code, APACHE 2.0), it's here:\n\n👉 [https://cocoindex.io/examples-v1/multi-codebase-summarization](https://cocoindex.io/examples-v1/multi-codebase-summarization)\n\nIf you find CocoIndex useful, a star on Github means a lot :)\n\n⭐ [https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex)\n\ni'd love to learn from your feedback, thanks!",

This is also the first time i'm implementing a complex system with onboard AI, so any tips would be welcome.\n\nThe problem is, i need my ai to be able to read enormous datasets at once, like a really big sales history (it is the biggest part), but I always hit limitations like text too big for sending in a request or it is way past the 128k token limit.  \nI tried using toon, but my agent got confused and returned nothing to an input that normally would generate data.\n\nRAG was an idea for saving tokens but, afaik, it shouldn't be used for calculations like this, but for textual understanding and searches.  \nProducing batch pre compiled analysis was also an option, but it would be really hard to preserve all the insights that are possible with the raw data.\n\nHow can i set it up to reading monstruous datasets like this?",

What security concerns do you run into?  \n  \n[https://trustagents.dev](https://trustagents.dev)",
