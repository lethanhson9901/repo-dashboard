Last night I thought: why not tackle something massive?\n\nTook the Epstein Files dataset from Hugging Face (teyler/epstein-files-20k) – 2 million+ pages of trending news and documents. The cleaning, chunking, and optimization challenges are exactly what excites me.\n\nWhat I built:\n\n\\- Full RAG pipeline with optimized data processing\n\n\\- Processed 2M+ pages (cleaning, chunking, vectorization)\n\n\\- Semantic search & Q&A over massive dataset\n\n\\- Constantly tweaking for better retrieval & performance\n\n\\- Python, MIT Licensed, open source\n\nWhy I built this:\n\nIt’s trending, real-world data at scale, the perfect playground.\n\nWhen you operate at scale, every optimization matters. This project lets me experiment with RAG architectures, data pipelines, and AI performance tuning on real-world workloads.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG](https://github.com/AnkitNayak-eth/EpsteinFiles-RAG)\n\nOpen to ideas, optimizations, and technical discussions!",

This is context rot.\n\n**The solution:** Instead of cramming everything into one prompt, the parent agent:\n\n1. Evaluates if the context is too large\n2. Uses a Python REPL to slice the text into chunks\n3. Calls `delegate_subtask`  to spawn a **child agent** at `depth + 1`\n4. Each child processes its chunk and reports back\n5. The parent synthesizes all answers\n\nThe recursion is depth-limited to prevent runaway chains.\n\n**The \"Glass Box\" UI:** Built with Chainlit, the UI shows nested steps in real-time so you can actually *see* the recursion happening:\n\n* 🧠 **Thinking…** — LLM reasoning (token by token)\n* 💻 **Coding…** — when the agent writes Python to slice text\n* 🔀 **Sub-Agent (Depth N)** — child agents spawning and reporting\n\n**Tech stack:**\n\n* LangGraph (StateGraph with conditional edges)\n* LangChain + Groq API (Llama 3.3 70B)\n* Chainlit for the UI\n* Python 3.11+\n\n**Repo:** [github.com/Dolphin-Syndrom/fractal-context](https://github.com/Dolphin-Syndrom/fractal-context)\n\n",

Single explanation gets split across two chunks. Tables lose their structure. Headers separate from data. The chunks going into your vector DB are semantically incoherent.\n\nI've been testing semantic boundary detection instead where I use a model to find where topics actually change. Generate embeddings for each sentence, calculate similarity between consecutive ones, split when it sees sharp drops. The results are variable chunks but each represents a complete clear idea.\n\nThis alone gets 2-3 percentage points better recall but the bigger win for me was adding metadata. I pass each chunk through an LLM to extract time periods, doc types, entities, whatever structured info matters and store that alongside the embedding.\n\nThis metadata filters narrow the search space first, then vector similarity runs on that subset. Searching 47 relevant chunks instead of 20,000 random ones.\n\nFor complex documents with inherent structure this seems obviously better than fixed chunking. Anyway thought I should share. :)",

      "text": "That discussion about MCPs being outdated and agents moving toward raw CLI access sent me down a rabbit hole I wasn't expecting. Been experimenting with OpenClaw recently (hard to ignore 160K stars) and saw someone in the GitHub issues flag a calendar integration skill that was requesting file system write access and network permissions for something that should just be reading a schedule. They dug into the code and found base64 encoded strings that decoded to external URLs and some sketchy eval statements. Maintainer removed it pretty quick but it had already been up for a few days.\n\nStarted googling after reading that thread and honestly got a bit worried. Apparently a decent chunk of community built skills have been flagged for doing sketchy things like data collection or downloading external payloads. Can't verify the exact numbers myself but it tracks with what I've been seeing in issue trackers. OpenClaw's own docs call the whole setup a \"Faustian bargain\" which... yeah.\n\nFeels like we're repeating the npm left-pad era except now the stakes are higher because these agents have real permissions. Read your emails, browse authenticated pages, execute shell commands. One bad skill and you've basically handed over the keys.\n\nSo now I'm being paranoid about everything. Manual code review when I have patience for it, though I'm slow at spotting obfuscated stuff. Checking GitHub issues and recent commits before installing anything. Running everything in Docker with network monitoring just in case. I've tried throwing Semgrep at some skills with mixed results, poked around with Snyk and Agent Trust Hub too. Even grep for obvious patterns like base64 or eval. The automated scanners all feel like security theater though when you're dealing with prompt injection vectors they weren't really designed for.\n\nStarting to think the only real answer is extreme permission isolation but that defeats half the usefulness of these agents. There's probably no good solution here.\n\nWhat does your vetting process look like before installing community stuff? Or is the general approach to just run everything sandboxed and hope for the best?",

The pipeline labels each chunk with trust and sensitivity independently, so piecemeal retrieval isn't a problem. The vector store just needs to carry provenance alongside the embedding. Logging is already granular per control surface, so you get the full audit trail of which rule fired and why. And I think that prompt engineering for risk mitigation is wishful thinking.",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nI have two announcements related to [Kreuzberg](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg):\n\n1. We released our new [comparative benchmarks](https://kreuzberg.dev/benchmarks). These have a slick UI and we have been working hard on them for a while now (more on this below), and we'd love to hear your impressions and get some feedback from the community!\n2. We released v4.3.0, which brings in a bunch of improvements including PaddleOCR as an optional backend, document structure extraction, and native Word97 format support. More details below.\n\n# What is Kreuzberg?\n\n[Kreuzberg](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg) is an open-source (MIT license) polyglot document intelligence framework written in Rust, with bindings for Python, TypeScript/JavaScript (Node/Bun/WASM), PHP, Ruby, Java, C#, Golang and Elixir. It's also available as a docker image and standalone CLI tool you can install via homebrew.\n\nIf the above is unintelligible to you (understandably so), here is the TL;DR: Kreuzberg allows users to extract text from 75+ formats (and growing), perform OCR, create embeddings and quite a few other things as well. This is necessary for many AI applications, data pipelines, machine learning, and basically any use case where you need to process documents and images as sources for textual outputs.\n\n# Comparative Benchmarks\n\nOur new comparative benchmarks UI is live here: [https://kreuzberg.dev/benchmarks](https://kreuzberg.dev/benchmarks)\n\nThe comparative benchmarks compare Kreuzberg with several of the top open source alternatives - Apache Tika, Docling, Markitdown, [Unstructured.io](http://Unstructured.io), PDFPlumber, Mineru, MuPDF4LLM. In a nutshell - Kreuzberg is 9x faster on average, uses substantially less memory, has much better cold start, and a smaller installation footprint. It also requires less system dependencies to function (only **optional** system dependency for it is onnxruntime, for embeddings/PaddleOCR).\n\nThe benchmarks measure throughput, duration, p99/95/50, memory, installation size and cold start with more than 50 different file formats. They are run in GitHub CI on ubuntu latest machines and the results are published into GitHub releases (here is an [example](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/releases/tag/benchmark-run-21923145045)). The [source code](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/tree/main/tools/benchmark-harness) for the benchmarks and the full data is available in GitHub, and you are invited to check it out.\n\n# V4.3.0 Changes\n\nThe v4.3.0 full release notes can be found here: [https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/releases/tag/v4.3.0](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg/releases/tag/v4.3.0)\n\nKey highlights:\n\n1. PaddleOCR optional backend - in Rust. Yes, you read this right, Kreuzberg now supports PaddleOCR in Rust and by extension - across all languages and bindings except WASM. This is a big one, especially for Chinese speakers and other east Asian languages, at which these models excel.\n2. Document structure extraction - while we already had page hierarchy extraction, we had requests to give document structure extraction similar to Docling, which has very good extraction. We now have a different but up to par implementation that extracts document structure from a huge variety of text documents - yes, including PDFs.\n3. Native Word97 format extraction - wait, what? Yes, we now support the legacy `.doc` and `.ppt` formats directly in Rust. This means we no longer need LibreOffice as an optional system dependency, which saves a lot of space. Who cares you may ask? Well, usually enterprises and governmental orgs to be honest, but we still live in a world where legacy is a thing.\n\n# How to get involved with Kreuzberg\n\n* Kreuzberg is an open-source project, and as such contributions are welcome. You can check us out on GitHub, open issues or discussions, and of course submit fixes and pull requests. Here is the GitHub: [https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/kreuzberg)\n* We have a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rzGzur3kj4) and you are all invited to join (and lurk)!\n\nThat's it for now. As always, if you like it -- star it on GitHub, it helps us get visibility!",

This leads to noisy knowledge bases full of redundant information.\n\nThe approach: memv uses predict-calibrate extraction (based on the [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03341](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03341)). Before extracting knowledge from a new conversation, it predicts what the episode should contain given existing knowledge. Only facts that were unpredicted — the prediction errors — get stored. Importance emerges from surprise, not upfront LLM scoring.\n\nOther things worth mentioning:\n\n* Bi-temporal model — every fact tracks both when it was true in the world (event time) and when you learned it (transaction time). You can query \"what did we know about this user in January?\"\n* Hybrid retrieval — vector similarity (sqlite-vec) + BM25 text search (FTS5), fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion\n* Contradiction handling — new facts automatically invalidate conflicting old ones, but full history is preserved\n* SQLite default — zero external dependencies, no Postgres/Redis/Pinecone needed\n* Framework agnostic — works with LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, or plain Python\n\n\n```python\n    from memv import Memory\n    from memv.embeddings import OpenAIEmbedAdapter\n    from memv.llm import PydanticAIAdapter\n    \n    memory = Memory(\n        db_path=\"memory.db\",\n        embedding_client=OpenAIEmbedAdapter(),\n        llm_client=PydanticAIAdapter(\"openai:gpt-4o-mini\"),\n    )\n    \n    async with memory:\n        await memory.add_exchange(\n            user_id=\"user-123\",\n            user_message=\"I just started at Anthropic as a researcher.\",\n            assistant_message=\"Congrats! What's your focus area?\",\n        )\n        await memory.process(\"user-123\")\n        result = await memory.retrieve(\"What does the user do?\", user_id=\"user-123\")\n```\n\nMIT licensed.

I’ve seen systems loop even when the data is clean, just because there’s no clear “done” condition, or agents keep optimizing instead of converging, or the planner state doesn’t reflect real progress. Sometimes two agents just implicitly disagree on whether the task is complete.\n\nSo I see Watchtower more as a runtime guardrail than a fix for bad tools. It doesn’t replace improving data quality, but it can surface pathological behavior early, regardless of the cause.\n\nOut of curiosity, in your experience were most loops purely data-quality issues, or did you also see coordination-level ones?",

Start with just the tool-calling loop... send a prompt, parse the function call, execute it, feed the result back, repeat until the model stops requesting tools. That's the entire skeleton.\n\nOnce that works, the next unlock is separating planning from execution. Have the model output a plan first, then execute each step. Without that split, anything beyond 2-3 tools falls apart because the model loses track of where it is.\n\nAnthropic's engineering blog and OpenAI's practical guide to building agents PDF both walk through this architecture. For interview prep specifically, being able to explain why you'd add memory, retry logic, or a supervisor pattern on top of that bare loop is more valuable than knowing any specific framework's API.",

While AmenLink focuses on spiritual AI assistance rather than AI agent development courses, I can offer some general advice from the tech world perspective that might be helpful. For practical, hands-on learning in AI agent frameworks, I'd suggest looking into:\n\n\n\n1.  Official documentation and examples from libraries like LangChain or LlamaIndex. They often have solid tutorials that walk you through building components like tool use, planning, and memory.\n\n2.  YouTube channels that focus on MLOps, AI engineering, or specific framework tutorials. Many independent creators offer deep dives into building custom agents.\n\n3.  Udemy/Coursera often have courses specifically on \"building AI agents\" or \"LLM application development\" which would cover your listed interests like orchestration and evaluation. Look for courses with high ratings and recent updates.\n\n4.  For multi-agent systems, research papers and their accompanying open-source implementations are gold. Platforms like Hugging Face often host these projects.\n\n\n\nMany learned by just jumping in, building small projects, and debugging their way through. Good luck with your learning journey – it's a fascinating field!",

I got frustrated with existing options being either too bloated or too toy-like, so I built what I actually wanted to use in production.\n\n\n\nHere's what it looks like:\n\n    ```from definable.agents import Agent\n    from definable.models.openai import OpenAIChat\n    from definable.tools.decorator import tool\n    from definable.interfaces.telegram import TelegramInterface, TelegramConfig\n    \n    @tool\n    def search_docs(query: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Search internal documentation.\"\"\"\n        return db.search(query)\n    \n    agent = Agent(\n        model=OpenAIChat(id=\"gpt-5.2\"),\n        tools=[search_docs],\n        instructions=\"You are a docs assistant.\",\n    )\n    \n    # Use it directly\n    response = agent.run(\"Steps for configuring auth?\")\n    \n    # Or deploy it — HTTP API + Telegram bot in one line\n    agent.add_interface(TelegramInterface(\n        config=TelegramConfig(bot_token=os.environ[\"TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN\"]),\n    ))\n    agent.serve(port=8000)\n    \n\n\n\n**What My Project Does**\n\nPython framework for AI agents with built-in cognitive memory, run replay, file parsing (14+ formats), streaming, HITL workflows, and one-line deployment to HTTP + Telegram/Discord/Signal. Async-first, fully typed, non-fatal error handling by design.\n\n\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nDevelopers building production AI agents who've outgrown raw API calls but don't want LangChain-level complexity. v0.2.6, running in production.\n\n\n\n**Comparison**\n\n\\- \\*\\*vs LangChain\\*\\* - No chain/runnable abstraction. Normal Python. Memory is multi-tier with distillation, not just a chat buffer. Deployment is built-in, not a separate project.\n\n\\- \\*\\*vs CrewAI/AutoGen\\*\\* - Those focus on multi-agent orchestration. Definable focuses on making a single agent production-ready: memory, replay, file parsing, streaming, HITL.\n\n\\- \\*\\*vs raw OpenAI SDK\\*\\* - Adds tool management, RAG, cognitive memory, tracing, middleware, deployment, and file parsing out of the box.\n\n\n\n\\`*pip install definable*\\`\n\n\n\nWould love feedback. Still early but it's been running in production for a few weeks now.\n\n\n\n[https://github.com/definableai/definable.ai](https://github.com/definableai/definable.ai)",

          "text": "\"Logs are not enough\" is exactly the right framing. I've been running into this constantly.\n\nOne specific question: when epi-recorder captures 'prompts and responses' in a multi-turn conversation, does it store the full context window at each step — meaning the entire accumulated prompt (system prompt + conversation history + all prior tool results that were included at that point)? Or does it capture the delta (what was new in that turn)?\n\nThe reason I ask: in a 40+ turn agent run, the bugs I struggle to debug are usually not in the last step. They're in a decision made at turn 23 where the model had accumulated a bunch of context from prior web searches and tool calls. To figure out why it made a weird choice at turn 23, I need to see what the FULL context window looked like at that exact moment — not just what new input was added.\n\nIf epi-recorder stores the full context snapshot at each step, it would actually solve this for me. The GitHub link is going in my queue either way — the cryptographic tamper-evidence angle is clever for any compliance use case.",

              "text": "Great question - this is exactly the class of problem EPI Recorder is designed for.\n\nIt captures the full context window at every step, not just the delta.\n\nBecause LLM APIs are stateless, the agent has to send the entire accumulated context (system prompt, conversation history, and any prior tool outputs) with each request. EPI Recorder intercepts the raw request payload just before it is sent, so each step shows exactly what the model saw at that moment.\n\nSo in your example: if something odd happens at turn 23, you can open step 23 and see the full prompt as it was sent, system prompt + turns 1–22 + turn 23 input - without reconstructing anything manually.\n\nA couple of implementation notes:\n\n- For OpenAI and Anthropic calls, the full message history is captured without truncation.\n- Gemini currently has a safety truncation in very large payloads (mainly to prevent massive image/video contexts from exploding log size), but that’s being refined.\n- For generic raw HTTP traffic, only metadata is stored, but LLM calls are recorded in full specifically to support debugging cases like the one you described.\n\nIf you end up trying it, I’d appreciate a star on the repo, it helps visibility and signals that this kind of tooling is actually needed.\n\n🙏🏻",
