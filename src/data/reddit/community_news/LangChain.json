      "text": "Hey r/LangChain,\n\nQuick recap for new folks: fastapi-fullstack is an open-source CLI generator (pip install fastapi-fullstack) that creates production-ready full-stack AI/LLM apps with FastAPI backend + optional Next.js 15 frontend. It supports PydanticAI, LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI – and now DeepAgents for advanced multi-agent systems.\n\n**v0.1.15 just released with full DeepAgents integration:**\n\n**Added:**\n\n* **DeepAgents as the fifth AI framework option** – new --ai-framework deepagents CLI flag\n* Built-in tools for file ops (ls/read/write/edit/glob/grep), code execution (disabled by default for safety), and task management (todos/sub-agents)\n* StateBackend for in-memory file state\n* Skills support via DEEPAGENTS\\_SKILLS\\_PATHS env var\n\n**Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) features:**\n\n* Tool approval workflow: Users can approve/edit/reject tool calls (configurable via DEEPAGENTS\\_INTERRUPT\\_TOOLS)\n* Frontend dialog for reviewing/editing JSON args in real-time\n* WebSocket protocol for interrupts: Backend sends tool\\_approval\\_required, frontend responds with resume decisions\n\n**Fixed & improved:**\n\n* Type annotations across CrewAI handlers (from previous updates)\n* WebSocket disconnect handling during agent processing\n* Frontend timeline connectors and message grouping\n* 100% test coverage (720 statements, 0 missing) with tests for all DeepAgents events, stream edges, and disconnects\n\nThis makes building and deploying DeepAgents-powered apps (with HITL for safe, controlled execution) super straightforward – perfect for complex, filesystem-aware agents.\n\nFull changelog: [https://github.com/vstorm-co/full-stack-fastapi-nextjs-llm-template/blob/main/docs/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/vstorm-co/full-stack-fastapi-nextjs-llm-template/blob/main/docs/CHANGELOG.md)  \nRepo: [https://github.com/vstorm-co/full-stack-fastapi-nextjs-llm-template](https://github.com/vstorm-co/full-stack-fastapi-nextjs-llm-template)\n\nLangChain community – how does DeepAgents + HITL fit your multi-agent projects?

It basically verifies if the output meets the constraints (like \"Must be valid JSON\" or \"Must not contradict previous step\") before returning the result.\n\nIf this works at scale, we might finally get agents that can handle complex multi-step logic without needing a dozen error-handling loops.\n\nCurious if anyone sees this replacing the current RAG/Chain-of-Thought meta for strict logic tasks?",

Logical Intelligence just announced Kona 1.0 with LeCun on the board, and their pitch is exactly this... learning by correcting mistakes rather than guessing tokens.\n\nThe catch is EBTs need to be trained from scratch. You can't fine-tune an existing foundation model into one. That's a brutal cold start when every team already has GPT-4 wrappers in production.\n\nFor strict JSON, constrained decoding (xgrammar, outlines) already solves it deterministically without the architecture swap. The interesting unlock would be multi-step logical consistency across tool calls, where autoregressive models keep painting themselves into corners. Still waiting to see benchmarks on that before swapping out the retry loops.",

      "text": "Most agents today are just “LLM in a loop + tools”. They are good at reasoning and works fine for short tasks. Over long-running tasks, they usually have no plan, lose context and their execution gets messy.\n\nMore capable agents like Claude Code and Manus get around this by following a common pattern: they plan first, externalize working context (files) and break work into isolated sub-tasks.\n\nDeep Agents from LangChain are really the next level, which essentially package this pattern into a reusable runtime. you call `create_deep_agent(...)` and get a StateGraph that:\n\n* plans explicitly\n* delegates work to sub-agents\n* keeps its state in files instead of bloating the prompt\n\nEach piece is implemented as middleware (To-do list middleware, Filesystem middleware, Subagent middleware).\n\nConceptually it looks like this:\n\n    User goal\n      ↓\n    Deep Agent (LangGraph StateGraph)\n      ├─ Plan: write_todos → updates \"todos\" in state\n      ├─ Delegate: task(...) → runs a subagent with its own tool loop\n      ├─ Context: ls/read_file/write_file/edit_file → persists working notes/artifacts\n      ↓\n    Final answer\n\nIt push key parts into explicit state (e.g. `todos` \\+ files + messages), but the main thing I noticed was visibility over frontend.\n\nI wired it up with CopilotKit - Infrastructure for building AI copilots into any app.\n\nIt keeps the frontend in sync with what the agent is doing by streaming events and state updates in real time (using AG-UI protocol under the hood).\n\nDeep Agents is really good at multi-step workflows & CopilotKit as the orchestration + UI layer. Check out the \"Job search assistant\" demo using this pattern.\n\nGitHub Repo: [https://github.com/CopilotKit/copilotkit-deepagents](https://github.com/CopilotKit/copilotkit-deepagents)  \nTutorial: [https://www.copilotkit.ai/blog/how-to-build-a-frontend-for-langchain-deep-agents-with-copilotkit](https://www.copilotkit.ai/blog/how-to-build-a-frontend-for-langchain-deep-agents-with-copilotkit)",

What I'm referring to here is a kind of \"Chat with your Documents\" type feature, where you scan a bunch of documents and then you can have a conversation with an AI about the documents (basic RAG).\n\n\n\n>\\* Openwork (LangChain Chat System, with Electron GUI Front end)\n\n>\\* Docling for Doc loading\n\n>\\* Milvus Vector DB  \n\n\n\n\nThis seems to be the holy grail that everyone is currently building right now (RAG systems), and I don't know if there's a popular project yet that incorporates all of the above into a single system people can just run without having to put together all the components themselves. When Openwork was recently released, that gets us 90% of the way to the finish line, but we just need a project that adds Docling and Milvus to finish it. It might be good to have a Docker Compose-base solution to this since there's several independent technologies that we're putting together.\n\n\n\nAny thoughts or ideas anyone has are greatly appreciate it.

      "text": "ChatGPT and similar models have become universal tools, which is why they so quickly entered the daily lives of millions of people. We use them to search for information, work with text, learn new topics, and hold discussions.  \n  \nHowever, chats themselves are not agents. They cannot operate in the real or digital world: they do not make decisions, execute chains of tasks, interact with services, or carry work through to completion.  \n  \nFor this reason, companies have begun building their own agent and multi-agent systems. These systems help users apply for loans, buy tickets, plan vacations, or complete paperwork.  \n  \nBut almost all such solutions remain narrowly specialized. Each agent is tightly bound to predefined scenarios and cannot go beyond the logic embedded by its creators.  \n  \nBecause of this, the next major technological breakthrough will likely be the emergence of universal agent systems accessible to ordinary users.  \n  \nExternally, they may look almost the same: a familiar chat interface with a bot. Internally, however, they will represent complex self-organizing systems composed of many agents, capable of understanding user goals, autonomously building plans, selecting tools, and adapting to changing conditions.  \n  \nIn essence, this marks a transition from “answering prompts” to digital assistants that can act — and may even possess their own form of intent within the boundaries of achieving the user’s goals, rather than merely reacting to commands.  \n  \nGiven the current pace of development in large language models and agent frameworks, it is entirely possible that the first truly universal multi-agent systems will appear by the end of 2026.\n\n  \n**What are your thoughts on the next breakthrough in our field?**",

When we scaled to multiple concurrent users, we kept hitting rate limits; even the paid tiers from DeepInfra, Cerebras, and Google throttled us too hard. Queue got completely congested.\n\nTried Vercel AI Gateway thinking the endpoint pooling would help, but still broke down after \\~5 concurrent users. The issue was we were still hitting individual provider rate limits.\n\nTo tackle this we deployed an LLM gateway (Bifrost) that automatically load balances across multiple API keys and providers. When one key hits its limit, traffic routes to the others. We set it up with a few OpenAI and Anthropic keys.\n\nIntegration was just changing the base\\_url in our OpenAI SDK call. Took maybe 15-20 min total.\n\nNow we're handling 30+ concurrent users without throttling. No manual key rotation logic, no queue congestion.\n\nGithub if anyone needs: [https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost)",

          "text": "What you’re describing is a classic “soft failure” pattern. Nothing crashes, but behavior degrades in ways users don’t explicitly report.\n\nIn our experience, prompt tuning alone rarely fixes this once agents are in prod. The issue is usually that the system treats all deviations as recoverable retries, so you get loops, drift, and slow convergence instead of clear failures.\n\nA few things that have helped teams reduce silent failures:\n- Make retries explicit and bounded. If an agent retries automatically without knowing why the previous step failed, you’re just amplifying noise.\n- Log decisions, not just inputs and outputs. When something feels “off” later, you want to know why a step was allowed to proceed.\n- Introduce step-level invariants. For example, “this tool call should only happen if X and Y are true,” rather than letting the model decide implicitly.\n- Treat back-and-forth with users as a signal. Repeated clarification loops are often silent failures in disguise.\n\n\nObservability helps, but only if it’s tied to execution state and decisions, not just traces. Otherwise you can see what happened without understanding why.\n\nCurious where you’re seeing the most drift today: tool selection, retries, or state/context getting lost across turns?",

When a remote agent requires payment, ampersend negotiates and executes the payment automatically via x402.\n\nSetup is straightforward - configure your wallet and treasurer, and your LangChain agent can discover remote agent capabilities, send messages, and pay for services without manual intervention. You set spend limits and policies upfront.\n\nUseful if you're building agents that need to:\n\n* Call paid APIs or data services\n* Use other specialized agents (research, analysis, etc)\n* Operate autonomously without constant human approval\n\nDocs:[ https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/tools/ampersend](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/tools/ampersend)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the x402 integration or agent-to-agent payments.\n\n",

If a user jailbreaks them once, the agent doesn't learn to be more defensive next time. It makes the same mistake twice.\n\nThe Solution: **Stateful Alignment Tracking** I built an open-source framework called **SAFi (Self-Alignment Framework Interface)**. The core innovation is a module that tracks the agent's coherence, detects drift, and provides live feedback to the model when it is going off-track.\n\n**The Stress Test** To test the system, I recently ran a public jailbreak challenge here on Reddit. I used a \"Socratic Tutor\" agent and challenged users to make it give direct answers or forget its purpose as a science/math tutor.\n\n* **Total Attacks:** 845\n* **Successful Jailbreaks:** 2\n* **Defense Rate:** 99.6%\n\nThe two \"successful\" jailbreaks were actually \"refusal answers\" for example, the agent said: *\"I won't tell you the answer to 2+2=4 because I want you to think!\"*\n\n**The Code** SAFi is 100% open source. You can find the repo, benchmarks, and raw logs here: **Repo:**[https://github.com/jnamaya/SAFi](https://github.com/jnamaya/SAFi)\n\nI'm looking for feedback from the builder community, especially on how you're handling stateful governance in your own agent stacks.",

          "text": "YAML with frontmatter is the cleanest pattern I've landed on. Structure like `_type: prompt`, `input_variables`, and `template` fields... LangChain's native serialization supports it out of the box.\n\nFor small projects, I keep prompts in a `/prompts` folder, one YAML file per template. Git diffs are readable, and you can load directly with `PromptTemplate.from_file()`. The langchain-hub repo structure is worth copying... they use json/yaml with relative paths for referencing shared components.\n\nThe counterargument (prompts-don't-belong-in-git camp) is that product iteration gets bottlenecked by deploys. Fair point if non-engineers need to tweak wording. But for dev-only projects, file-based wins on simplicity. You skip the Langfuse/LangSmith dependency until you actually need versioning across environments.",

      "text": "When streaming messages from Claude (Anthropic models) in LangGraph, the model sometimes includes explanatory text before making tool calls (e.g., \"I'll get the weather information for both New York and San Francisco for you.\").\n\nThe problem is that these text chunks arrive before the tool\\_use content blocks, making it impossible to determine whether the streaming text is:\n\n1. Preliminary reasoning/thoughts that precede a tool call, or\n2. The actual final response to the user\n\nThis creates a challenge for UI rendering, as we cannot know whether to display the text immediately or wait to see if a tool call follows.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n\nEither:\n\n* Provide a way to identify which text chunks are associated with tool calls versus final responses during streaming, or\n* Offer a configuration option to disable these preliminary text chunks entirely when tools are being used, so only the tool calls and final responses are streamed\n\n**Current Workaround:**\n\nCurrently, we must wait until the complete message is received to determine the message type, which defeats the purpose of streaming for real-time UI updates.\n\n**Script**\n\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph, add\\_messages\n\nfrom langchain.tools

But not sure about this is the best for UI. Because for example when I use Claude Sonnet in Pycharm Github Copilot extension, It can separate thinking/tool using explanations while it’s streaming on UI. Maybe they use another abstraction or algorithm to distinguish. That’s why I thought there might be a way.",
