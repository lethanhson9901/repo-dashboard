Include methodology details or link to reproducible results. (2) You haven't addressed failure modes: what happens when Python execution times out, crashes, or needs to handle dynamic content/JavaScript rendering?

Ref-based interactions (e.g. “click e7”) so the model can drive flows on a live app.\n* Node side: Connect to a running Node process (PID, --inspect port, or Docker), set tracepoints/logpoints without pausing, run JS in the process, resolve source maps. Handy for debugging APIs and workers while the app runs.\n\nSo the same MCP can drive the frontend in a browser and inspect/debug the backend in Node.\n\nCLI as well\n\nYou can use it from the terminal too: browser-devtools-cli and node-devtools-cli (e.g. navigate, take screenshots, connect to a Node process with --inspector-port). Useful for scripts and quick checks without opening an IDE.\n\nLinks\n\n* Docs/site: [browser-devtools.com](http://browser-devtools.com)\n* NPM: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-devtools-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-devtools-mcp)\n* Cursor/OpenVSX Extension: [https://open-vsx.org/extension/serkan-ozal/browser-devtools-mcp-vscode](https://open-vsx.org/extension/serkan-ozal/browser-devtools-mcp-vscode)\n\nIf you’re using MCP with Cursor or Claude and want the model to actually use a browser and attach to Node backends, this might be worth a try.

With WebMCP, people can easily declare MCP Tools in their website itself that makes things unified, and much more reliable and efficient. As you can see in the demo, the agent made 100+ tool calls directly to our website, which has tools exposed using WebMCP and composed a music piece with 0% error rate in tools calls, meaning it does the right thing on website instead of clicking random buttons.",

Agent runs --help only when it needs a specific tool.\n\nNumbers across different usage patterns:\n- Session start: 15,540 (MCP) vs 300 (CLI) - 98% savings\n- 1 tool call: 15,570 vs 910 - 94% savings\n- 100 tool calls: 18,540 vs 1,504 - 92% savings\n\nCompared against Anthropic's Tool Search too - it's better than raw MCP but still more expensive than CLI because it fetches full JSON Schema per tool.\n\nConverter is open source: https://github.com/thellimist/clihub\nFull write-up with detailed breakdowns: https://kanyilmaz.me/2026/02/23/cli-vs-mcp.html\n\nDisclosure: I built CLIHub.

That’s not mandatory. Agents can fetch tool definitions incrementally and only load what they actually need. In that setup, the claimed massive startup savings of CLI don’t automatically apply.\n\nWhere CLI really has a structural advantage is in looping scenarios. If a tool needs to be called repeatedly, the classic MCP flow forces the model to re-plan and re-emit structured calls every time. That quickly becomes expensive and slow. With a CLI, the agent can generate a small script and execute the loop outside the model. In those cases, CLI is genuinely cheaper and faster.",

We’re focused on agent skills + gating unsafe CLI behaviors (permissions, sandboxing, retries, guardrails, etc.). MCP support is additive because it’s a nice interface layer, not the whole product.\n\nAlso: MCP is a protocol. If the argument is \"make your MCP special by embedding workflows,\" at that point you’re basically building an application-specific service anyway which you can still do with a normal API.\n\nAnd Figma’s MCP is genuinely good inspiration, but in general MCP is pretty obsolete in comparison to agent skills (which basically has both prompts and elicitation built-in; try the superpowers agent skill for example).",

Gemini's free tier through Google AI Studio is generous, so the flow is straightforward: I receive a query, pass it to Gemini, get a summarized result back as a tool response.\n\n \n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/claudiusbotticus/gemini-research-mcp](https://github.com/claudiusbotticus/gemini-research-mcp) (free and open source)\n\n \n\nSetup takes a couple minutes — free API key from aistudio.google.com, run setup.py, add to Claude Desktop config.

      "text": "Hey so I made this [https://github.com/postrv/forgemax](https://github.com/postrv/forgemax), based off foundational work done by Anthropic and Cloudflare - it's modelled strongly after Cloudflare's Code Mode, which is an effort that is worth of praise in its own right. Check them out!  \nWhere mine differs is it works as a purely local solution. It provisions a secure V8 sandbox in which LLM-generated code can be run, meaning we can reduce context usage from \\`N servers x M tools\\` to 2 tools - \\`search()\\` and \\`execute()\\`.   \nThis allows the LLM to do what it's good at - writing and executing code - and thus scales the ability for us to detect and use the connected tools correctly to a few search and execute steps. It also allows us to chain requests, meaning actual tool call count also drops through the floor.  \nI've tried pretty hard to make it secure - it's written in Rust, uses V8/deno\\_core, and has been subjected to several rounds of hardening efforts - and I've written up some notes in the \\`ARCHITECTURE.md\\` file regarding considerations and best practices if you're to use it.  \nI'd love to get user feedback and be able to iterate on it more - I shipped it late last night, finessed it a bit this morning before work, and am writing this on my lunchbreak. So far, real world usage for me has seen me use it to run two high-tool count MCP servers including my other mcp project, [https://github.com/postrv/narsil-mcp](https://github.com/postrv/narsil-mcp) and a propietary security tool I've been working on (a total of 154 tools) easily and with extreme token efficiency (Cloudflare note about 99% reduction in token usage in their solution - I'm yet to benchmark mine). Theoretical upper bound for connected tools is 5000 - maybe more.   \nAnyway, check it out, let me know what you think: [https://github.com/postrv/forgemax](https://github.com/postrv/forgemax)   \nThanks!

Discovery time is significantly lower than going with the docker-gateway solution.

      "text": "Google released early preview of WebMCP and it's quite interesting, it adds “AI in the browser,” and it changes how agents interact with web apps at the execution layer.\n\nRight now, browser-based agents mostly parse the DOM, inspect accessibility trees, and simulate clicks or inputs. That means reasoning over presentation layers that were designed for humans. It works, but it is layout-dependent, token-heavy and brittle when UI changes.\n\nWith WebMCP, Instead of scraping and clicking, a site can expose structured tools directly inside the browser via `navigator.modelContext`.\n\nEach tool consists of:\n\n* a name\n* a description\n* a typed input schema\n* an execution handler running in page context\n\nWhen an agent loads the page, it discovers these tools and invokes them with structured parameters. Execution happens inside the active browser session, inheriting cookies, authentication state, and same-origin constraints. There is no external JSON-RPC bridge for client-side actions and no dependency on DOM selectors.\n\nArchitecturally, this turns the browser into a capability surface with explicit contracts rather than a UI. The interaction becomes schema-defined instead of layout-defined, which lowers token overhead and increases determinism while preserving session locality.\n\n[Core Architectural Components](https://preview.redd.it/vp5ne4ehaflg1.png?width=2592&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c809cda4bf6a8fd88f982e707457a33a1c1847)\n\nSecurity boundaries are also clearer. Only declared tools are visible, inputs are validated against schemas, and execution is confined to the page’s origin. It does not eliminate prompt injection risks inside tool logic, but it significantly narrows the surface compared to DOM-level automation.\n\nThis lines up with what has already been happening on the backend through MCP servers. Open-source projects like InsForge expose database and backend operations via schema-defined MCP tools.\n\nIf backend systems expose structured tools and the browser does the same, agents can move from UI manipulation to contract-based execution across the stack. WebMCP is in early preview for now but it's very promising.\n\nI wrote down the detailed breakdown [here](https://insforge.dev/blog/webmcp-browser-native-execution-model-for-ai-agents)",

I actually built an MCP server recently that solves a specific workflow gap I kept running into with Claude Code.\n\nThe problem was the constant copy-paste loop between Claude and Codex windows when I wanted to bounce ideas, get parallel plans, or validate approaches. So I built Claude Co-Commands - an MCP server that adds three collaboration commands directly to Claude Code:\n\n- `/co-brainstorm` for bouncing ideas and getting alternative perspectives from Codex\n- `/co-plan` to generate parallel plans and compare approaches  \n- `/co-validate` for getting that staff engineer review before finalizing\n\nThe MCP approach means it integrates cleanly with Claude Code's existing command system. Instead of running terminal commands or switching windows, you just use the slash commands and Claude handles the collaboration with Codex automatically.\n\nIt's not trying to be a marketplace, just solving that specific workflow friction point. If you're writing MCP servers, you might find the approach interesting - it's basically turning the copy-paste loop into a clean command interface.\n\nhttps://github.com/SnakeO/claude-co-commands",

I wanted something that works inside the browser I'm already using — so the AI can interact with pages where I'm already logged in, without exporting cookies or managing sessions.\n\nQuick start: `npx webclaw-mcp` + load the Chrome extension.\n\nWorks with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/kuroko1t/webclaw\n\nHappy to hear feedback — first time sharing an MCP tool here.",

      "text": "I maintain **Bifrost**, and once you go past \\~10 MCP servers, things start getting messy.\n\nFirst issue: tool name collisions. Different MCP servers expose tools with the same names. For example, a `search_files` tool from a filesystem server and another from Google Drive. The LLM sometimes picks the wrong one, and the user gets weird results.  \nWhat worked for us was simple: namespace the tools. So now it’s `filesystem.search_files` vs `gdrive.search_files`. The LLM can clearly see where each tool is coming from.\n\nThen there’s schema bloat. If you have \\~15 servers, you might end up with 80+ tools. If you dump every schema into every request, your context window explodes and token costs go up fast.  \nOur fix was tool filtering per request. We use virtual keys that decide which tools an agent can see. So each agent only gets the relevant tools instead of the full catalog.\n\nAnother pain point is the connection lifecycle. MCP servers can crash or just hang, and requests end up waiting on dead servers.  \nWe added health checks before routing. If a server fails checks, we temporarily exclude it and bring it back once it recovers.\n\nOne more thing that helped a lot once we had 3+ servers: **Code Mode**. Instead of exposing every tool schema, the LLM writes TypeScript to orchestrate tools. That alone cut token usage by 50%+ for us.\n\nIf you want to check it out:  \nCode: [https://git.new/bifrost](https://git.new/bifrost)  \nDocs: [https://getmax.im/docspage](https://getmax.im/docspage)",

      "text": "I’ve been hitting a wall where multi-agent systems work well until the agents actually start changing things.\n\nIt’s super easy to scale parallel agents because you can run multiple branches and compare outcomes then pick the best path.\n\nBut that’s only when AI agents are reading, right. The minute they are writing, everything falls apart and we’re dealing with overwriting file edits and overwritten configs. The shared state becomes the real bottleneck. It’s impossible to track which sub agents did what.\n\nSo after dealing with this I realised the issue isn’t the model quality. Like, I tried swapping out for better models inside different AI agent frameworks, but I realised I was placing the burden on the quality and it wasn’t actually tackling the real problem.\n\nIn a recent build I had I tried workspace isolation for our coding agents. The thing is that model context protocol is good at describing what MCP tools do and how to call them but it doesn’t define where those tool calls execute or the shared mutable state they operate on. Once tools mutate state the execution context is part of the problem.\n\nWhat I did was introduce a workspace layer with a small set of primitives. I made an isolated workspace and cloned it so I could compare the changes. Then I could merge the results or disregard it all. \n\nEach of the parallel agents got its own sandbox so even when they modify state it keeps the parallelism intact.\n\nSo in practice I needed to map workspaces to Git worktrees for quick branching and merging natively without custom glue code inside the agent orchestration layer.\n\nWith the isolating in place there wasn’t fragility with the parallel writing anymore and there wasn’t coordination overhead, instead the subagents could explore multiple strategies and merge the winner with the failures just thrown away instead of me tidying up this big cluster of a mess.\n\nAt this point I am wondering if anyone building stateful agent orchestration systems has done something similar or if they are tackling shared mutable state in a different way?",
