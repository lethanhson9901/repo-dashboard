      "text": "I have been consistently putting MCPs to use in my daily real work, not just for showing demos. Initially, these ones ignited quite a hype, and now, they have grown on me. What mattered to me: setup should be painless, they shouldnt flake out, and I should notice when theyre gone.\n\n### **GitHub MCP** [https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)\n\nThis was the thing that really gave the agent the feel that it was working within the repo. Issues, commits, PR context, file history, all without copy, pasting links or dumping files into prompts. Seriously cant imagine doing heavy, duty work without this feature now.\n\n### **CodeGraphContext MCP** [https://github.com/CodeGraphContext/CodeGraphContext](https://github.com/CodeGraphContext/CodeGraphContext)\n\nThis one is the quiet time-saving hero. It stores a structured graph of the codebase internally at all times, so the agent is pre-equipped with an understanding of how files, functions, and classes relate to each other. Refactors and what breaks if I change this? become pretty reliable.\n\n### **Context7 MCP** [https://github.com/upstash/context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7)\n\nThis one made my agents stop guessing APIs. Whenever I request something using a library or framework, it automatically pulls the correct docs. I open docs tabs so rarely now.\n\n### **Firecrawl MCP / Jina Reader MCP** [https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl) [https://github.com/jina-ai/reader](https://github.com/jina-ai/reader)\n\nBoth of these are wonderful at converting dirty web pages into spotless Markdown. Great for blogs, specs, or lengthy articles where you just want the content, not the site.\n\n### **Figma MCP** [https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP)\n\nDesign → code, but done properly. Instead of screenshots, the agent sees real Figma structure: layouts, components, variants, tokens. Frontend output is noticeably closer to the design.",

For example, chaining shell commands vs processing individual commands. \n\nMy guess is that future foundational models will be better at navigating with language servers vs the graph approach.

      "text": "Hey r/mcp,\n\nJust released v2.0.0 of my Ghidra MCP Server with **110 tools** — by far the most feature-complete Ghidra integration for MCP. For context, the most popular one (LaurieWired's, 7K+ stars) has about 15 tools.\n\n## What makes this different\n\n🔧 **110 MCP tools** covering decompilation, disassembly, analysis, annotation, data types, and project management\n\n🔄 **Cross-binary function documentation transfer** — hash functions by behavior (not addresses), so when a new binary version drops, all your annotations carry over automatically. No more re-doing work across versions.\n\n⚡ **Batch operations** — analyze multiple functions/addresses in one call (93% API call reduction vs. one-at-a-time)\n\n🐳 **Headless mode + Docker** — run analysis pipelines without the GUI. `docker compose up` and you're analyzing binaries.\n\n📋 **.env configuration** — no hardcoded paths, everything configurable\n\n## Real-world usage\n\nI've been using this for Diablo 2 reverse engineering across 20+ patch versions. The function hash registry has **154K+ entries** — when a new patch drops, annotations transfer automatically instead of starting from scratch.\n\n## What's new in v2.0.0\n\n- Localhost-only binding for security (no more accidental network exposure)\n- Configurable decompile timeout\n- New label deletion tools (delete_label + batch_delete_labels)\n- .env-based configuration (no hardcoded paths)\n- Ghidra 12.0.2 support\n- Complete README rewrite with full API reference\n\n## Links\n\n- **GitHub:** https://github.com/bethington/ghidra-mcp\n- **v2.0.0 Release:** https://github.com/bethington/ghidra-mcp/releases/tag/v2.0.0\n\nPart of a broader RE toolkit — I also maintain [cheat-engine-server-python](https://github.com/bethington/cheat-engine-server-python) for dynamic analysis via MCP and [re-universe](https://github.com/bethington/re-universe) for BSim-powered binary similarity at scale.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the architecture, the hashing algorithm, or how MCP fits into RE workflows.",

From those best practices, we distilled an initial set of 22 evaluation rules which we then instruct our system to evaluate each and every MCP server repository against. Multiple agents evaluate the source code against a combination of SAST and DAST tools with the specific intent of gathering sufficient evidence as to whether the repo has one or more security findings based on each evaluation rule. For each vulnerable finding, our system proposes practical fixes that the MCP repo creator can take to improve the operational security of the implementation as well as mitigations any MCP server operator can take if they choose to deploy the server themselves.\n\nOne of the biggest issues facing the MCP server ecosystem, is that there may be many different implementations of the same server -- some repos are clearly more secure than others. The goal of this trust registry is to help both MCP server owners and operators safely build and deploy MCP servers.",

When it expires mid-execution, recovery is ugly.\n\nThe bigger issue: scopes are per-user but agents need per-action authorization. User has read/write, but should agent be allowed to delete based on this specific context? OAuth grants access, doesn't enforce policy at decision time.\n\nWe ended up with OAuth for authentication plus runtime policy gates for authorization. Token proves identity, policy layer decides if this specific action is allowed right now. Two-layer approach.\n\nSDK helps with flow but doesn't solve: token refresh during long-running agent execution, scope escalation when agent needs more access mid-task, or evidence of what was authorized when.\n\nMost people skip OAuth because they're prototyping and it's friction. Production agents need it, but OAuth alone isn't enough - you need runtime policy on top.",

When we built MCP support into Bifrost, the OAuth flow got weird fast. \n\nThe trickiest part was handling token refresh across multiple MCP servers. Agent makes 10 tool calls across different servers, each with different auth states. Do you refresh proactively? Wait for 401s? How do you handle one server's auth failing mid-workflow?\n\nWe ended up supporting vault integration (HashiCorp, AWS Secrets Manager) for key management, which helps but doesn't solve the agent-as-user identity problem.\n\nFor Bifrost specifically, we let you configure auth per MCP server connection and handle token lifecycle at the gateway level. Agents just call tools, gateway manages the OAuth dance.\n\nDocs: [https://docs.getbifrost.ai/mcp/overview](https://docs.getbifrost.ai/mcp/overview)\n\nStill feels like there should be a cleaner pattern though. What approach did you settle on with Gopher's SDK? Curious how others are handling the scopes-per-call problem.",

Local Memory has a fundamentally different architecture that addresses this flaw.\n\n# New Features\n\n# Multi-Provider AI Backend\n\n* Split Architecture: Separate `EmbeddingProvider` and `ChatProvider` interfaces allow independent configuration\n* Provider Mixing: Use different providers for embeddings vs chat (e.g., Ollama for embeddings, Anthropic for chat)\n* Fallback Chains: Optional fallback providers for resilience when primary providers fail\n* Circuit Breaker Pattern: All providers include circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures\n\n# Agent Attribution\n\nTrack which agent stored or updated memories and from which machine:\n\n* Agent Type Detection: Automatically detects whether memories come from Claude Desktop, Claude Code, REST API, or other sources\n* Hostname Tracking: Records the machine hostname for multi-device memory attribution\n* HTTP Headers: REST API clients can set `X-Agent-Type`, `X-Agent-Context`, `X-Access-Scope`, and `X-Agent-Hostname` headers\n* MCP Detection: Automatically detects agent type from session ID patterns and environment variables\n\n# Default Domain with MCP Prompts\n\nOrganize memories by project with intelligent domain detection:\n\n* Default Domain: New `session.default_domain` config option (defaults to \"general-knowledge\")\n* Domain Cascade: Explicit domain > agent config file > config default\n* Agent Config File Detection: Reads domain from CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or GEMINI.md:\n   * HTML comment: `<!-- domain: project-name -->`\n   * Markdown header: `## Domain: project-name`\n   * YAML frontmatter: `domain: project-name`\n* MCP Prompts Protocol: New `prompts/list` and `prompts/get` methods\n   * `domain_selection` prompt instructs agents on domain handling\n   * Lists existing domains from database\n   * Provides usage examples\n\nYou can read the full write-up on v1.4.0 here: [https://www.localmemory.co/blog/local-memory-1.4-multi-provider-ai](https://www.localmemory.co/blog/local-memory-1.4-multi-provider-ai)\n\nYou can learn more about the knowledge hierarchy architecture released in v1.3.0 here: [https://www.localmemory.co/blog/local-memory-1.3-series-the-journey-to-world-memory](https://www.localmemory.co/blog/local-memory-1.3-series-the-journey-to-world-memory)",

For example, claude has a [\"tool search tool\"](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-search-tool) that makes a toolset discoverable, so all MCP servers aren't loaded right off the bat.  But it is somewhat of an unsolved problem.    \n  \nFor that reason, you can also attach individual [\"categories\"](https://docs.tinyfn.io/mcp/categories) of tools with TinyFn.  I am thinking about other ways to solve this as well (allowing users to select from everything and exactly what tools they want to expose for a specific MCP server? would be cool--I haven't quite figured it out yet)",

Include market size, major players, growth trends, and a chart of adoption over time.”\n* “Use my notes in `knowledge_base` plus web search to analyze whether solar panels are worth it for a home in California. Build a payback-period model and visualize cashflows.”\n* “Use `web_research` \\+ RAG + code execution to build a small cost-of-ownership calculator for my commute.”\n\n**Why I’m posting here**\n\nI’d really appreciate feedback from this community on:\n\n**MCP design:**\n\n* Does the tool surface / boundaries make sense for MCP?\n* Anything you’d change about how `web_research` / `rag_tool` / `code_sandbox` are exposed?\n\n**Safety & sandboxing:**\n\n* Are there better patterns you’ve used for constrained code execution behind MCP?\n* Any obvious gotchas I’m missing around resource limits or isolation?\n\n**RAG + research UX:**\n\n* Suggestions for better chunking/query strategies in this “research agent” context?\n* Patterns you’ve used to keep the agent grounded in sources while still being autonomous?\n\n**Extensibility:**\n\n* Other tools you’d add to a “research engineer” server (data connectors, notebooks, schedulers, etc.)?\n* Thoughts on integrating with other MCP clients beyond Claude Desktop / Cursor?\n\nIf you have time to glance at the repo and tear it apart, I’d love to hear what you think. Happy to answer implementation questions or discuss MCP patterns in more detail.\n\nIf you end up trying it and think it’s useful, please consider dropping a ⭐ on the GitHub repo and sharing any ideas/issues there as well.\n\nThanks!\n\n[AI Research Engineer](https://i.redd.it/sczg2svgn3ig1.gif)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kwh5dbntczhg1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c7729e95890dce291ad8e635feca5a2805583b2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4e0nlantczhg1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1e3f3eabe67ff887c8ca994f0090c74989621f6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zx4v3puuczhg1.png?width=4168&format=png&auto=webp&s=f798447d3b5bf5510400b832af96161488c4e25c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmec8quuczhg1.png?width=3702&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a8fe3d1c47a464c6f733cfa4c2463d25ccd5d5b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zv5hnuuczhg1.png?width=3568&format=png&auto=webp&s=162f410cc6edd2b46bd1c0a8f36a7e4a0afb9e12",

That's why I often have repetitive flows in n8n, and n8n gives OpenClaw instructions via MCP. As I wrote somewhere above, Claw mainly gives me the ability to test and prototype a flow. When I like it and it's functional, I usually convert it into some kind of automation. In my case, Claw basically just handles working with GitHub and passes instructions to Claude Code on what to do (bug fixes). This can then be taken over by a simple Golang script. Otherwise, it's definitely important for me to isolate Claw in Docker. If it crashes, I just throw away the container and start fresh. Memory is usually in an external volume. Theoretically, I've been thinking about adding some kind of memory module or something like that. I use that approach on my other online MCP tools. Anyway, thanks for the feedback! :)\n\nOh and about the Docker setup — I usually have CC, GH, or whatever else pre-installed. I don't want it installing anything on its own. That's always a road to hell...  \n",

      "text": "We just released SBP (Stigmergic Blackboard Protocol), an open-source protocol for multi-agent AI coordination.\n\n**The problem:** Most multi-agent systems use orchestrators or message queues. These create bottlenecks, single points of failure, and brittle coupling between agents.\n\n**The approach:** SBP uses stigmergy — the same mechanism ants use. Agents leave signals on a shared blackboard. Those signals have intensity, decay curves, and types. Other agents sense the signals and react. No direct communication needed.\n\n**What makes it different from MCP?** MCP (Model Context Protocol) gives agents tools and context. SBP gives agents *awareness of each other*. They're complementary — use MCP for \"what can I do?\" and SBP for \"what's happening around me?\"\n\n**What's included:**\n\n* Full protocol specification (RFC 2119 compliant)\n* TypeScript reference server (`@advicenxt/sbp-server`)\n* TypeScript + Python client SDKs\n* OpenAPI 3.1 specification\n* Pluggable storage (in-memory, extensible to Redis/SQLite)\n* Docker support\n\n**Links:**\n\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/AdviceNXT/sbp](https://github.com/AdviceNXT/sbp)\n* npm: `npm install` u/advicenxt`/sbp-server`\n* PyPI: `pip install sbp-client`\n\nHappy to answer questions about the protocol design, decay mechanics, or how we're using it.",

Decay curves and signal intensity don't help if agents can't reason about why a signal was left.\n\nThe real bottleneck in multi-agent systems isn't communication topology.

Every signal carries typed JSON payloads, source agent IDs, UUIDs, and timestamps. Downstream agents know *what* happened, *who* said it, and *how fresh* it is. The agent's internal reasoning (RAG, CoT, whatever) is its own business, SBP only handles coordination.\n\nOn \"traces without memory fail\" - agreed, if signals are unstructured. Ours aren't. We also have capped audit streams with pheromone UUIDs for full temporal reconstruction. Decay isn't a substitute for reasoning, it's a safety invariant: unreinforced signals evaporate, the system hibernates instead of acting on stale data.\n\nOn shared state corruption, thank you, your strongest point. But the tradeoff: a bad orchestrator decision persists until a human catches it. A bad SBP signal *decays away*. Plus agents gate on composite thresholds (e.g., drift > 0.6 AND VIX ≤ 25), so a single bad signal can't cascade. Orchestrators are easier to debug after the fact. Stigmergic systems fail more safely in real-time. Thanks again.",

When requests come through the gateway, we automatically inject those tools into the request regardless of which LLM you're using. So your filesystem MCP server that works with Claude? Now works with GPT-4, Gemini, etc.\n\nThe setup is straightforward - configure MCP servers once in Bifrost, then any model you route through can use them. We support STDIO, HTTP, and SSE connections.\n\nWhat made this useful: you can test which model handles your specific MCP tools better. Same filesystem operations, same tools, different models. Turns out some models are way better at tool orchestration than others.\n\nAlso built \"Code Mode\" where the LLM writes TypeScript to orchestrate multiple tools in one request instead of back-and-forth. Cuts down latency significantly for complex workflows.\n\nAll the MCP tools show up in our observability UI so you can see exactly which tools got called, what parameters, what they returned.\n\nSetup guide: [https://docs.getbifrost.ai/mcp/overview](https://docs.getbifrost.ai/mcp/overview)\n\nAnyone running MCP servers in production?

Once we started connecting third-party MCP servers to real agents, a few questions kept coming up:\n\n• How do you know an MCP server is safe before connecting it?\n\n• Where does agent data actually go across servers?\n\n• Can one MCP influence model behavior or exfiltrate data meant for another?\n\n• Can an LLM be nudged into calling tools it shouldn’t?\n\nWe went looking for “trust layer” for MCP servers and couldn’t find a comprehensive catalog or standardized risk assessment. So we ended up building one internally and decided to make it public. We analyzed MCP servers across a few dimensions:\n\n• provenance (official vs community)\n\n• MCP spec conformance\n\n• OWASP-style risks applied to agentic systems\n\n• static analysis for AI-specific patterns\n\n• CVEs, dependency issues, and runtime behaviors like prompt injection or cross-server data access\n\nSome of the findings were concerning: exposed API keys, servers pulling in known malicious packages, and tools that appear to attempt context poisoning or cross-server data access.\n\nFull disclosure: [https://mcp.armor1.ai/mcp-directory](https://mcp.armor1.ai/mcp-directory)\n\nThe catalog is free, public, and doesn’t require a login. It’s still evolving, and I’d genuinely love input from people here:\n\n• How are you evaluating MCP servers today?\n\n• Are there risk categories you think we’re missing?\n\n• Would a shared trust / risk signal for MCP servers actually be useful?",

I started with 8 tools, tags, metadata fields, expiration dates. Every parameter I added was another decision the LLM had to make on every call, and it got worse at using the system. Stripping it down to store content and recall query made the LLM actually use it well without explicit prompting.\n\nUnder the hood it does more than the simple API suggests. Vector search (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via Candle), hybrid BM25 scoring, memory decay with a 30-day half-life, a property graph for linking related memories, and auto-consolidation that merges near-duplicates. All of that is invisible to the LLM. It just calls store and recall.\n\nI benchmarked it against 5 alternatives (1,000 memories, 200 queries):\n\n* R@1: 50% (vs 47% next best)\n* Recency@1: 100% (vs 14% for competitors)\n* Auto-dedup: 99% consolidation rate\n\nSingle Rust binary, zero external dependencies.

If I don’t store memories for 30 days I probably don’t want all of it to decay, but if I hammer on the storage layer, 30 days seems too long. This is definitely an area that needs more tuning.\n\nI originally had different decay and storage parameters for different types of memory, based on this paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05470). But this required the LLM to classify memories at write time and it adds all sort of additional context and complexity (tags etc).\n\nI’ve found that recall boost via the access count does a great job while keeping the memory schema simple. Additionally it works across multiple categories. Simply put, memory recalled more often surfaces more often. Architecture decisions are likely recalled at a higher frequency than one off debug sessions. Lastly, you can opt to keep debug sessions in local context and never add to memory.",

As far as I understand them at least. \n\nI hear about MCP servers being quite expensive on the token count and loading too much context, but then going into skills more, how to you coherently manage and deploy the things to a user base not as technical as yourself?\n\nI've a reverse API proxy service I'm working on fronting with some appropriate AI interface, and I've wavered back and forth between both forms, and am mostly coalescing on both at the same time, merging the concept together and was keen to hear takes on how bad an idea this is, or how much money it'll make me...\n\nThere's notional methods to create plugins for skills, but isn't that basically already what an MCP is? Especially if you reframe it from a number of tools to do tasks into a few tools to provide knowledge on how to do a task, these things are starting to look very similar.\n\nMy first MCP had a tool for searching, say, the finance system, another for the monitoring system... but I've since replaced it with a tool to get overview docs, a tool to get specific docs and a tool to actually communicate with the entire proxy. This is modelling, I think, the layout of skills. My tool to hit the proxy IS the very same script that would sit in the scripts/ directory in a Skill layout. the basic overview, what would be the frontmatter in a skill is delivered on loading the MCP etc... everything gets its exact equivalent.\n\nI may be naive, but I see no reason why, if an agent wants more information about system X, it would be any more or less likely, or more or less better off, by getting a chunk of knowledge from a tool call vs reading a secondary local text file. Is there \\*ANY\\* difference at all?! \n\nI feel like there can't be, neither can be better or worse. It's still just at the mercy of what the agent chooses to do next. it wouldn't use one implementation but not the other (assuming it's only aware of one at any given time). Am I missing something fundamental about how agents work and engage with resources?\n\nSo here I am trying to put finishing touches on a solution that can be used 100% as equally as a skill or as an MCP, just depending on how the user chooses to install it. I'm mulling over the best ways to converge the two. like, should the MCP just download it's skill data and say \"hey, there's a skill in that folder\" every time? \n\nEach implementation seems to push me further towards more convergence, where the only thing I know I need is some python script running locally in either a persistent or single shot mode depending on whether I'm orientating it in MCP or skill mode, and increasingly not really seeing much difference between the two.",

The delivery mechanism (tool call vs file read) doesn't change what the agent does with the information.\n\nThe real difference is deployment friction. Skills are simpler to distribute—just copy some files and the agent picks them up. MCP requires a running server process, which means your users need to manage that lifecycle. For a reverse API proxy where you're already running something persistent, that difference matters less.\n\nIf you're already converging the implementations, lean into it. The script that hits your proxy is the same whether it's called from an MCP tool or a Skills script. The knowledge chunks are the same whether delivered via tool response or file read. You're just adapting the interface layer to fit each pattern.\n\nThe only place I'd be careful is state management—if your proxy needs persistent connections or session state, MCP's long-running process model fits better than Skills' ephemeral execution. But for stateless queries it really doesn't matter which interface you expose.",
