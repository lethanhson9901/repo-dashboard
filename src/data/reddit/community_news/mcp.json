      "text": "Anthropic recently published an [engineering post about code execution with MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp) that addresses a growing pain point: as agents connect to more tools, context windows get bloated with definitions the agent never uses.\n\n**The core insight is simple:**\n\nTraditional MCP clients dump all tool definitions into context upfront. Connect a GitHub server with 30 tools? That's \\~30,000 tokens consumed before your agent reads a single word of your request. Scale to multiple servers and you're burning context on tools you'll never call.\n\n**Progressive loading flips this:**\n\nInstead of \"here are all 200 tools, figure it out,\" you give the agent a filesystem of tool definitions. It explores with `ls`, reads only what it needs with `cat`, and executes directly. One tool ≈ 500 tokens. Load 2-3 tools per task instead of 200.\n\n**Claude Code integration:**\n\nThe tool also generates [SKILL.md files](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) — structured instructions that teach Claude Code how to discover and use the generated tools. Drop it into your project and Claude Code knows exactly where to look and how to call your MCP servers.\n\n**I built** [**mcp-execution**](https://github.com/bug-ops/mcp-execution) **to automate this** — it introspects any MCP server and generates standalone TypeScript files with full type definitions.\n\nFor anyone building agents that connect to multiple MCP servers, this pattern is worth considering. The token savings compound quickly.",

I think the separation of tool is helpful as a concept.  The assistant understands it has arms and legs and the right hand can do this magical thing called code execution.  I now think of the mcp level tools like 'system' calls and I put the assistant in that mood to keep it on track.  There are challenges here though, sometimes the assistant (cursor, claude) will get stuck trying to fill every request via code execution, like literally trying to fix code in your project via code execution.  Not sure if you have seen similar mis fires.",

I've wired up north of about 7000 apis and have only an occasional (10%) misfire that the agent recovers from in a single call.  I do think there is a bit of an art to discovery though.  This type of breath without rot requires 3 searches upfront (list api server**S**, list api server tools,and finally get tool info) and 2 thereafter for each discovery of a new REST call before a code execution.   I think thats about the best we can ask for.  This type of progressive discovery allows for access to countless api's.  Schemaless is another story (think git cli calls) once the agent thinks its a tool it can pretty much one shot everything like muscle memory.  This is why I question MCP's like Github MCP.   Things really start to fly when you rely on the agents training data, not the reasoning power, but the \"facts\" for well known api's.  All you have to do is simply get out of the way.  Sort of like what we all do in cursor now when we ask the agent to suss out a few diffs or some other git action.  This is the very reason why headless IDE, like Claude cli are so freaken powerful.  Agents got bash terminal stuff on lock.  Pure muscle memory,  'free' context.   And yes, naming conventions certainly help.  Agents love patterns.  I lean on XML markers and make sure that no matter what the downstream service is (REST, Graphql, MCP, Schemaless) the progressive discovery follows the same pattern and returns the right level of data at the right time and shape agnostically.\n\nI find that this along with code execution allow us to make agency pluggable.

Interesting that you see \\~10% misfire rate even at 7000 APIs — that's actually encouraging for the approach.\n\nYour point about schemaless tools and \"muscle memory\" resonates. Agents know git, curl, jq from training data — wrapping them in MCP schemas sometimes adds friction rather than removing it. The GitHub MCP example is spot on: Claude already knows `git` commands cold, so the MCP layer becomes overhead.\n\nThe XML markers idea for uniform discovery shape is clever. Mind sharing more on that? I've been using consistent file structure + [SKILL.md](http://SKILL.md), but a protocol-agnostic marker system could be cleaner.\n\nAgree on headless IDEs. Claude Code + bash is absurdly effective precisely because it's just \"write code, run it\" — no translation layer.\n\n>Quite frankly I don't see how folks like n8n will survive this\n\nHot take but hard to argue.

          "text": "So I’ll address the points of the blog because I disagree that MCP is a fad. Developers can and will offload any work they don’t have to do to focus on the bits that they do. \n\nThe first was over the incoherent toolbox problem, too many tools, no glue to hold them together. This is directly solved by anthropic’s agent profiles and skills, you give the agent a specified subset of tools, tailored to its domain, along with instructions for using that toolchain in the domain. \n\nThe second was over arbitrary runtimes. This one is a valid point but is also one that I don’t really care about because it mostly just feels like optimization-maxxing. MCP servers and their dependencies aren’t perfectly stable and no frills as they may claim, but as a developer, they’re good enough, and if the usecase is important enough - I’ll figure it out.\n\nThe third one is the biggest one, security. This is also a valid problem with MCP, but this is also a component that any major company wanting to expose MCPs is working through to provide reliable authentication for these toolchains which can capture the data security researchers/defense needs while also ensuring reliable authentication to fend off any explicit man in the middle attack. This one just strikes me as a maturity problem in the tech\n\nUltimately, writing your own functions as a way to enable your AI agent is not the way. Those functions all already exist, instructions of how or why to call are important by domain, maybe agents could even get skills on writing the functions themselves by need. But the layer of abstraction exists for a reason, and it’s because I care about what my agent does and enabling it to do that as soon as the capability landscape supports it",

This can be used as tools for LLMs in a similar way local tools are invoked by an LLM. In general the LLM sends a message to the calling application or agent and the agent code handles the invocation of the tool either locally or MCP and then send the results back to the LLM. If you use local tools they are usually written in the same language the agent is written in. \n\nThe nice thing about MCP is that a vendor can provide a MCP server that has defined input and outputs and provides a service to the agent. We don’t care how the MCP implemented the tools as long as the outputs are what we expecting. If the MCP server is well tested it is quick to integrate and robust.  \n\nIf you integrate with APIs via tool calling you can achieve the same than an MCP server, but you usually have to write the code that invokes the api and then manages the calling of the api and error handling on the client side. So some development work here.\n\nIn other words MCP is not the only way to invoke a tool but in many cases the simpler approach with minimal development work. It also provides an easier way to share tools across organizations and agents. \n\nIn my view the success is based on the ease of use. So MCP is not a fad just another tool calling mechanism. We can also expect other features to be included in the future like skills for example.",

WhatsApp has proper E2E encryption, session management, and complex sync protocols.\n\nThat's why there are so few libraries that do this ***well***. Most WhatsApp automation tools rely on browser automation (Puppeteer/Selenium) which is fragile and breaks constantly (ok, i know it occurs on bare requests too, but less...)\n\nwhatsmeow is one of the rare libraries that properly reverse-engineered the protocol and maintains compatibility.

      "text": "Hey 👋\n\n  Released **Skill Seekers v2.5.0** with universal LLM support - convert any documentation into structured markdown skills.\n\n  ## What It Does\n\n  Automatically scrapes documentation websites and converts them into organized, categorized reference files with extracted code examples. Works with any LLM (local or remote).\n\n  ## New in v2.5.0: Universal Format Support\n\n  - ✅ **Generic Markdown export** - works with ANY LLM\n  - ✅ **Claude AI** format (if you use Claude)\n  - ✅ **Google Gemini** format (with grounding)\n  - ✅ **OpenAI ChatGPT** format (with vector search)\n\n  ## Why This Matters for Local LLMs\n\n  Instead of context-dumping entire docs, you get:\n  - **Organized structure**: Categorized by topic (getting-started, API, examples, etc.)\n  - **Extracted patterns**: Code examples pulled from docs with syntax highlighting\n  - **Portable format**: Pure markdown ZIP - use with Ollama, llama.cpp, or any local model\n  - **Reusable**: Build once, use with any LLM\n\n  ## Quick Example\n\n  ```bash\n  # Install\n  pip install skill-seekers\n\n  # Scrape any documentation\n  skill-seekers scrape --config configs/react.json\n\n  # Export as universal markdown\n  skill-seekers package output/react/ --target markdown\n\n  # Result: react-markdown.zip with organized .md files\n```\n\n  The output is just structured markdown files - perfect for feeding to local models or adding to your RAG pipeline.\n\n  Features\n\n  - 📄 Documentation scraping with smart categorization\n  - 🐙 GitHub repository analysis\n  - 📕 PDF extraction (for PDF-based docs)\n  - 🔀 Multi-source unified (docs + code + PDFs in one skill)\n  - 🎯 24 preset configs (React, Vue, Django, Godot, etc.)\n\n  Links\n\n  - GitHub: https://github.com/yusufkaraaslan/Skill_Seekers\n  - PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/skill-seekers/\n  - Release: https://github.com/yusufkaraaslan/Skill_Seekers/releases/tag/v2.5.0\n\n  MIT licensed, contributions welcome! Would love to hear what documentation you'd like to see supported.",

Noticed it didn't make the final list, so figured I'd share what it actually does since it's a bit different from the others.\n\nMost gateways here focus on routing/proxying - which they do well. DeployStack is more of a team layer on top of MCP:\n\n* Credential vault - API keys stored encrypted, not in Slack DMs or .env files\n* RBAC - control who on your team can use which MCP servers\n* One URL for the whole team - new dev joins, they get access to everything instantly\n* Token reduction is there too (98% via 2-tool router), but honestly that's table stakes now\n\nIf you're a solo dev, MCPO or Bifrost are probably simpler. DeployStack makes more sense when you have a team and start asking \"wait, who has the Stripe API key?\" or \"what MCP tools is everyone actually using?\"\n\nIt's open source: [https://github.com/deploystackio/deploystack](https://github.com/deploystackio/deploystack)\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone's curious about the team use case.",

You have to be very careful at times and build safe guards into your tools. For example in my mcp server I had a read\\_file tool. simple except for the fact it read a file much larger than it should have, the context immediately jumped to 800k tokens and the chat was unrecoverable.\n\nfrom there i started to build in hard coded limits like limiting the max lines readable to 500 for read\\_file. Then when we build composite tools, we can think of different ways to do them. My favorite is enum menus where tools can be more modular and one tool can serve many different functions.\n\nThen we can also add in batch tools.  \nbatch\\_read\\_files  \nbatch\\_string\\_replace  \nbatch\\_read\\_lines  \netc\n\nthis allow us to turn 20 calls into 1. A time saver and a context saver for the misc info we get from tool outputs.",

      "text": "There seems to be a lot of confusion in the community that skills replace or at least overlap with MCP.\n\nThis is false in my opinion. Skills work in conjunction with MCP.\n\nI'll explain why:\n\nThis confusion stems from the fact that both these concepts talk about tools.\n\n👉 Skills are just a fancy name for additional specialized prompts that are loaded into context just-in-time, ie, the LLM reads them ONLY when it determines that this skill is required for the current task.\n\nAnd how does the LLM decide this?\n\nBecause at the start, the LLM knows the name & basic description of every skill available to it. When it gets a task, it decides based on the descriptions whether any particular skill is relevant and if one is found, its whole promptset is loaded into the context window.  \nOnce loaded, the LLM now has a much better idea of WHAT to do, and WHICH MCP TOOLS TO CALL to perform certain external actions like creating a jira ticket, making a payment or executing some code.\n\n👉 MCP tools continue to provide your \"skilled\" LLM the access to external resources (mostly APIs!). MCPs provide to the LLM any functionality that requires deterministic behaviour.\n\nAs an example, here's how one such flow would play out:\n\n1. LLM starts with basic knowledge of available skills - \"order\\_from\\_amazon\", \"calculate\\_velocity\".\n2. User input: \"I need to buy a black silicon phone cover. Max budget is $20. Please order it.\"\n3. LLM decides to use the order\\_from\\_amazon skill because it thinks it is relevant.\n4. order\\_from\\_amazon skill's prompts tell the LLM to use the \"browse\\_catalogue\" & \"place\\_order\" tools from the Amazon MCP Server.\n   1. **Note that the skill is ultimately just a prompt, it cannot magically allow the LLM to make a payment. LLM still needs the MCP tool(s) to do that.**\n5. LLM invokes the tool and returns a response to user.\n6. Mission accomplished!\n\nSkills provide specialized knowledge to the LLM\n\nMCP provides access to the LLM\n\nThey compliment each-other.\n\nHope this clarifies the confusion!",

Ideally the agent should make three calls consistently for any initial action, then two from that point on.  Ex: list\\_api\\_servers, search\\_api\\_server\\_tools, get\\_tool\\_info, followed by code execution.  Then next go at this SHOULD start with search\\_api\\_server\\_tools, thereby skipping the context already gained by the original list\\_api\\_servers call.  This is progressive discovery and its part and parcel to skills otherwise you end up with the same 'rot' caused by MCP's.  This is a critical distinction.  Skills are ANY pre packaged and scripted form of execution.  Goal being more deterministic outcomes via guardrails embedded in prompts or executable scripts.    Its essentially a workflow in the form of a prompt or code.  We consider skills to be composable units of a workflow.  \nMCP can compliment this in many ways oAuth for security, tool calling which is now muscle memory from fine tuning (often over looked advantage of mcp) etc.. The two intersect and compliment by providing a single MCP tool to execute code/skills/workflows.   We spent quite a bit of time (agent time) in the trenches on this project which you can hook up to your IDE of choice with a few clicks.  The whole approach is extremely powerful and brings seamless access to thousands of api's where you are.  Bottom line, code execution is the purest form of 'agency' I've seen to date.   We just need to get out of the models way and let it cook.  Anyway, you are free to see it in action as a service.   \n\nFor the brave  \n[https://app.apifunnel.ai/engineering](https://app.apifunnel.ai/engineering)  \n  \nFor everyone else  \n[https://app.apifunnel.ai](https://app.apifunnel.ai)\n\n[https://www.loom.com/share/40f3e69d64944404850927f081bcb7d9](https://www.loom.com/share/40f3e69d64944404850927f081bcb7d9)",

      "text": "I’ve been having conversations with some founders + devs recently, and I’ve been seeing a lot of confusion around the difference between workflows and agents. I want to weigh in on this question and offer my framing, which I believe will help you wrap your mind around these ideas.\n\nA good definition is the essence of understanding, so let’s try to get to a reasonable definition for both of these concepts.\n\n\n\n**What is an agent?**\n\nThe first distinction to make is that “agent” is not a binary quality. It is rather a question of degree: to borrow a term from Karpathy, the *autonomy slider* characterizes the degree to which a system / entity is autonomous — and this is agency. Agency is a spectrum, like intelligence or any other quality: the more autonomous, the more it can affect its environment, the more agency it has; and vice versa.\n\nA child is therefore less of an agent than an adult. Its autonomy and capacity to act in the world are constrained by its dependence on the parents, and lack of experience / understanding. An employee is likewise less of an agent than a founder who acts autonomously on his / her own initiative — in other words, has less *agency* than the founder.\n\nWith this I think we can formulate a reasonable definition of an “agent”:\n\n\\> An agent is an entity which interacts with some environment, and has the capacity to make decisions + take actions in that environment in the pursuit of some objective / goal.\n\n[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ItjM!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffb20919c-42b7-4ff0-8d9e-47448fe13572_1494x548.png)\n\nSo the basic ingredients that define an agent are:\n\n* An entity that exists in an environment\n* Can make decisions\n* Has a concrete set of potential actions\n* “Desires” to move towards some reward / goal.\n\nNow this seems to me a fair and general definition of an agent, which will not lead to any confusion of the particular terms that are floating around today. People will suggest that an agent is an LLM with “tools”, and while that may be the form it takes today, this will be confusing in the end if we don’t have the general shape in our mind first. A “tool” is merely a special kind of action, where action is the general class of behaviors / means of affecting the world; “tools” are merely a subset of the conceivable action space — just as a square is a subset of a rectangle.\n\n\n\n**So what is a workflow?**\n\nA workflow, on the other hand, is some structured repeatable process. A workflow is contrasted with an agent in the sense that an agent is an actual entity with a dynamic action space, while a workflow is merely a static process. It is a sequence of “steps” which always have the same shape every time.\n\nNow the confusion that I’ve seen is caused in large part by the fact that they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In other words, you could have steps in a workflow which involve agents, i.e. an agent processes the input for a given step before passing off the result to the next one — but this is no different from the kinds of structured processes companies frequently design in order to standardize some process within human ‘workflows’.\n\nThink of some structured inbound sales process. Whether or not an agent is responsible for “handling” a given step makes no difference — the workflow is defined by the general structure + relationship of the steps, where the output of each step feeds into the input of the next one:\n\n1. A sales rep gets an email from a prospect\n2. They qualify that lead with an initial conversation\n3. Lead is interested, escalate to CEO for closing conversation\n4. Lead closes, onboarding is handled by another team.\n\nThe inputs of this workflow have changed hands through multiple ‘agents’ (people), and yet there is a clear sequence of steps which produce well-defined outputs which are prepared to be processed by the next person in the chain.\n\nTherefore a workflow can be defined as follows:\n\n\\> A workflow is a structured, repeatable sequence of steps whose outputs become the inputs for each subsequent step.\n\nWorkflows are great whenever you have a repeatable procedure that can be defined / known at “compile time”. But what makes a workflow different from normal code? Doesn’t a typical program fit the definition we outlined? Technically yes, but colloquially, the term “workflow” is reserved for a special kind of system where the steps have special properties. Those properties tend to include things like:\n\n* Durability\n* Replayability\n* Long-running execution (ability to sleep, etc.)\n\nThere is an ecosystem of solutions springing up around this idea of “durable execution”. Platforms like Temporal, Inngest, Vercel’s WDK (workflow development kit). They give you the ability to persist the results of steps, to let workflows sleep for a long period of time while waiting for the result of a step or some external event, etc. — and for this reason, the term “workflow” is a nice catch-all for these special properties that you might want when architecting a system.\n\n\n\n**When should I use each one?**\n\nAgents are not better than workflows, and vice versa — they both merely have their particular use cases. You want to reach for them in the right situations. Generally, an agent is useful whenever you have an open-ended task, where there isn’t a predefined procedure that it can follow to get to the desired result (notice how this can also fit within a workflow step as I mentioned). It might be scraping the web for a list of companies that fit some general criteria, or debugging a program where the bug isn’t known. All these require the ability to make decisions + act in some constrained environment.\n\nWorkflows, on the other hand, are useful when you need predictability + structure in some process. You want the deterministic sequence of steps to run the same way every time, within bounds. You want to make sure that the output has a definite known shape, and maybe you also need some of the properties of the workflow platforms that I mentioned earlier.\n\nPerhaps all this is already obvious to you, but with so much marketing hype around tools like n8n and other workflow builders, I wanted to help clear up this confusion for anyone who might not have had a clear picture before :)\n\nTell me, did you have the same confusion before this? I know I still did before writing this post ..",

      "text": "Been using Claude with Microsoft 365 via MCP and hit two frustrations:\n\n**Problem 1: Context bloat**\n\nThe popular MS Graph MCPs expose 30-40 specialized tools like `list-mail-messages`, `create-calendar-event`, `get-user`, etc. That's ~12KB of context eaten up before you even start talking. Claude already knows the Graph API - it doesn't need 37 hand-holding tools.\n\n**Problem 2: Multi-tenant switching sucks**\n\nI manage multiple M365 tenants (work, clients, personal). Every time I wanted to query a different tenant, I had to call `select-account`, wait, then make my request. Constantly switching context.\n\n**The fix:**\n\nForked the Softeria MCP and stripped it down to 7 tools:\n- `login`, `logout`, `verify-login` (auth)\n- `list-accounts`, `select-account`, `remove-account` (account management)\n- `graph-request` (one tool for ALL Graph API calls)\n\nThe `graph-request` tool takes an `accountId` parameter, so you can query any tenant directly without switching:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"endpoint\": \"/me/messages\",\n  \"accountId\": \"client-tenant-abc123\"\n}\n```\n\nQuery work and personal calendars in the same conversation. No switching dance.\n\n~1KB context instead of ~12KB. Same capabilities.\n\n**Repo:** https://github.com/ForITLLC/forit-microsoft-graph\n\nMIT licensed, fork of Softeria's work. Just a different philosophy - less is more.\n\nAnyone else running into context bloat issues with MCPs?\n",

Clients are where it gets fucked.\n\nI spent a lot of time trying to distinguish the two, and built my own custom client for my server before realizing I can just connect it to something like ChatGPT connector(called app now) or Claude. Found mcp in December 2024 when there were no docs. There are docs now you can copy to a tee and change 2-3 lines to have your server up. \n\nWhat I’m saying is: figure out building servers and getting them to work with other clients, and don’t worry about clients until you have your head wrapped around a lot more.\n\nIt’s really simple. Define mcp server. Define the tools. Handle the transport. Anything else will probably add complexity and is unneeded. ",

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nKept looking for a **deep research** workflow that acts like a good analyst team aka : gather sources, generate hypotheses, challenges/critiques, and stitch a crisp answer. \n\nMost DR products (or modes) end up with 1-shot DR.   \n  \nNot to forget :   \n(a) single model hallucinations (made up links anyone?)  \nor   \n(b) a pile of unstructured notes with lil accountability\n\nI often keep running the output copy pasting from one model to another to validate the hypothesis and synthesis. \n\nthe current work is inspired a ton by Karpathy’s work on the LLM-council repo - over the holidays, built **Counsel MCP Server**: an MCP server that runs **structured debates** across a **family of LLM agents** to **research + synthesize** with fewer silent errors. The council emphasizes: a debuggable artifact trail and a MCP integration surface that can be plugged in into any assistant.\n\nIf you want to try it, there’s a **playground assistant** with Counsel MCP already wired up: [**https://counsel.getmason.io**](https://counsel.getmason.io/)\n\n# What it does ?\n\n* You submit a research question or task.\n* The server runs a structured loop with multiple LLM agents (examples: propose, critique, synthesize, optional judge).\n* You get back artifacts that make it inspectable:\n   * **final** synthesis (answer or plan)\n   * **critiques** (what got challenged and why)\n   * **decision record** (assumptions, key risks, what changed)\n   * **trace** (run timeline, optional per-agent messages, cost/latency)\n\nThis is not just \"N models voting.” in a round robin pattern - the council will do structured arguments and critique aimed at better research outcomes.\n\n# Have 3 top of mind questions - any feedback here would be great?\n\n1. What’s a useful API variant here ?\n   * A single `counsel.research()` or `counsel.debate()` tool plus resources?\n   * Or multiple tools (run, stream, explain, get)?\n2. What’s the right pattern for research runs that take 10–60 seconds?\n   * streaming events\n   * polling resources\n   * returning everything inline\n3. What should the final artifact contain?\n   * final output only\n   * final + critiques\n   * full trace + decision record\n   * what’s the minimum that still makes this debuggable and trustworthy?\n\nGive it a spin & tell me what gives\n\nPlayground: [**https://counsel.getmason.io**](https://counsel.getmason.io/)\n\nIf you try it, I’d love to hear any feedback good, blahhhh, meh?",

Interestingly, we're seeing this a lot as critical for multi-agent MCP systems.  \n  \nHow are you currently validating that the debate structure produces reliable results, and what's been your approach to debugging when the council output is unexpected?\n\n  \nthought of throwing in some views in here  \n===================================  \n  \nOur approach has 3 layers:\n\n\\#1 - Validation: Strict JSON schemas per phase, mandatory evidence citations (no unsourced claims), and a locked Crux Registry after the Attack phase to prevent semantic drift. We validate at the structure level (schema compliant) and semantic level (crux stability, agreement thresholds per tension).\n\n\\#2 - Debugging: Every debate produces an append-only artifact trail - transcripts per role/round, the exact context each role saw (including argument shuffle order), schema repair attempts, and crux evolution. When output is out of bounds (unexpected), we trace back through - which role drove the conclusion   \n→ what evidence was cited   \n→ whether the crux positions shifted unexpectedly   \n→ whether validation repair led to loss in nuance.\n\n\\#3 - We also support human-in-the-loop intervention (pause, steer, modify\\_tensions) for real-time course correction when you see the debate heading somewhere wrong. the \"debuggable artifact trail\" you talk abt is what this is optimized for - a multi-agent debate synthesis is only trustworthy if you can audit the reasoning chain.",

Conceptually, FrontMCP CodeCall sits one layer above a typical MCP gateway.\n\nAn MCP gateway mainly focuses on routing and unifying multiple MCP servers behind a single endpoint. It still relies on list_tools and exposes full tool schemas to the model, which means token usage and tool-selection complexity grow linearly with the number of tools.\n\nCodeCall tackles a different problem: scaling agent reasoning and tool orchestration when tool counts get large.\n\nInstead of exposing all tools, FrontMCP exposes 4 meta-capabilities (search / describe / invoke / execute). The model:\n\t•\tdiscovers tools on demand,\n\t•\tfetches only the schemas it needs,\n\t•\tand can run a short JS AgentScript to orchestrate multi-step workflows server-side.\n\nThat’s why token savings tend to hold even as tool count grows.\nDocs (design + API): https://agentfront.dev/docs/plugins/codecall/overview\n\nThe tradeoff is that once you allow model-written code, sandboxing becomes critical. That’s why CodeCall runs on Enclave VM, a locked-down JS sandbox with defense-in-depth, which we’re actively pressure-testing via a public CTF:\nhttps://enclave.agentfront.dev\n\nSo in practice:\n\t•\tMCP gateway → aggregation + routing\n\t•\tFrontMCP CodeCall → discovery, orchestration, and token-efficient execution (and it can sit behind or alongside a gateway)\n\nHappy to dive deeper if you’re comparing architectures.",

The *issue* is that it's harder to verify and interpret the scripts its writing in the background to get these tasks done.\n\nMCP is a much better experience for AI to do less predictable exploration and configuration in external systems.

No curl escaping,\n    no dependency issues, no environment mismatch.\n\nThe folder structure is completely open. The only requirement is a [SKILL.md](http://SKILL.md) at the root. This makes it trivial to turn **any existing codebase** into an MCP tool.\n\n    my-tool/\n    ├── SKILL.md          # Tool manifest (required) - defines inputs, outputs, and execution\n    ├── main.py           # Your code (any language)\n    └── requirements.txt  # Dependencies (optional)\n\n# The MCP server\n\nEnact ships with an MCP server that exposes 4 meta-tools:\n\n|Tool|Description|\n|:-|:-|\n|`enact_search`|Semantic search for tools|\n|`enact_learn`|Get schema and documentation (SKILL)|\n|`enact_run`|Execute any tool from the registry|\n|`enact_install`|Install to add to tool list|\n\nAdd it to Claude Code:\n\n    claude mcp add enact -- npx -y @enactprotocol/mcp-server\n\nIn addition, enact also has a full CLI where an agent or human can do things like:\n\n    # Set secrets securely\n    enact env set FIRECRAWL_API_KEY \"fc-xxx\" --secret\n    \n    # Publish tools (private by default)\n    enact publish ./my-tool\n    \n    # Learn about a tool\n    enact learn username/firecrawl\n    \n    # Run it\n    enact run username/firecrawl --url \"https://example.com\"\n\n# How is this different from distributing containerized MCP servers?\n\nYou could distribute containerized stdio servers, but Enact offers:\n\n* **Granular composition**: Install only the tools you need, from different authors. Not \"install this server and get all 20 of its tools whether you want them or not.\"\n* **Simpler authoring**: A `SKILL.md` manifest in any codebase is easier to write than implementing a full MCP server.\n* **On-demand execution**: Tools run when needed, not as persistent servers.\n* **Single portable artifact**: The `SKILL.md` defines runtime, dependencies, and interface together.\n\n# How is this different from Agent Skills?\n\nEnact shares similar goals with [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) but takes a more constrained, container-first approach:\n\n|Aspect|Agent Skills|Enact|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Execution|Flexible, runs in host environment|Always containerized (Docker/Dagger)|\n|Dependencies|Host-dependent|Declared in manifest, isolated|\n|Interface|Flexible code contracts|Strict JSON Schema|\n|Portability|Depends on environment|Guaranteed by container|\n|Context usage|Can flood context with intermediate output|Returns only the final result|\n\nThe tradeoff: Agent Skills are more flexible, but that flexibility means no guarantees about dependencies or cross-machine compatibility. Enact trades some flexibility for portability, isolation and cleaner context.\n\nWould love feedback on this approach.\n\n* **Try it**: `npm install -g enact-cli && enact run enact/hello-python`\n* **GitHub**: [github.com/EnactProtocol/enact](https://github.com/EnactProtocol/enact)\n* **Discord**: [discord.gg/mMfxvMtHyS](https://discord.gg/mMfxvMtHyS)",

We kept seeing people burn through tokens just sending tool catalogs back and forth.\n\nClassic flow looks like:\n\n* Turn 1: Prompt + all 100 tool definitions\n* Turn 2: First result + all 100 tool definitions again\n* Turn 3: Second result + all 100 tool definitions again\n* Repeat for every step\n\nThe LLM spends more context reading about tools than actually using them.\n\n**What we built:**\n\nInstead of exposing 100+ tools directly, Code Mode exposes just 3 meta-tools:\n\n1. List available MCP servers\n2. Read tool definitions on-demand (only what you need)\n3. Execute TypeScript code in a sandbox\n\nThe AI writes TypeScript once that orchestrates all the tools it needs. Everything runs in the sandbox instead of making multiple round trips through the LLM.\n\n**The impact:**\n\nPeople testing it are seeing drastically lower token usage and noticeably faster execution. Instead of sending tool definitions on every turn, you only load what's needed once and run everything in one go.\n\n**When to use it:**\n\nMakes sense if you have several MCP servers or complex workflows. For 1-2 simple servers, classic MCP is probably fine.\n\nYou can also mix both - enable Code Mode for heavy servers (web search, databases) and keep small utilities as direct tools.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nThe AI discovers available servers, reads the tool definitions it needs (just those specific ones), then writes TypeScript to orchestrate everything. The sandbox has access to all your MCP tools as async functions.\n\nExample execution flow goes from like 6+ LLM calls down to 3-4, with way less context overhead each time.\n\nDocs: [https://docs.getbifrost.ai/features/mcp/code-mode](https://docs.getbifrost.ai/features/mcp/code-mode)\n\nCurious what people think. If you're dealing with MCP at scale this might be worth trying out.",

Any challenges integrating servers with literally thousands of api's?  Feels like we'd be at about the same bloat with one api server discovery call.  Not sure.  Curious to hear your thoughts.   Not looking for secret sauce, I think a pattern will emerge here regardless soon enough and there is more than enough food on the table for all pioneers at this early stage\n\nOur approach:  \nlist servers, \\***search** 'tools'/api calls, tool\\_info, execute.   List servers is only called once per session 90% of the time so we live with the \"search tools on server\" call followed by get tool info.  We end up with two calls for every execution, but we gain infinite scale for breath and depth.

I've been working on [MCP Directory](https://mcpdir.dev/) — an open-source hub that aggregates MCP servers from multiple sources into one searchable place.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Pulls servers from mcp-registry, npm, GitHub topics, Glama, PulseMCP, official modelcontextprotocol repos and more\n* Auto-extracts tools, resources, and prompts from READMEs using AI\n* Deduplicates and merges data (same server can appear in multiple sources)\n* Currently tracking **8,000+ servers** with daily syncs\n\n**Why I built it:**  \nFinding MCP servers was scattered — some on npm, some only on GitHub, some in curated lists. I wanted one place to search, filter, and discover what's actually out there.\n\n**Open source:** [github.com/eL1fe/mcpdir](https://github.com/eL1fe/mcpdir)\n\nWould love feedback or contributions.

Better strategies perform better with large documents but they all get worse the more docs you hold.\n\nI see this all the time with people building agents and it usually results in a custom fine tuned tag solution for a use case.  So a specific rag for processing text in a textbook versus a different rag for processing text from a novel.

I literally spend **HOURS** searching for new cool stuff to do with MCPs. Am I crazy?\n\nThe ecosystem is real, and some startups are doing genuinely interesting work here:\n\n**mcp-use (YC S25)** \\- Building open-source dev tools and infrastructure for MCP. Their SDK has 170,000+ downloads and 7,000 GitHub stars. NASA is using them to build their internal agent \"MADI\". They provide hosted and self-hosted platforms that manage auth, access control, and multi-user environments for secure MCP deployment at scale. [https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use)\n\n**Klavis AI (YC W25)** \\- Solving the enterprise MCP integration problem with open-source, hosted MCP servers and built-in multi-tenancy auth. One of their co-founders co-authored the Gemini paper and built the tool calling infrastructure for Gemini at Google DeepMind. Their value prop: integrate enterprise-grade MCP servers with your AI app in a minute, skip the client-side development hassle. [https://www.klavis.ai/](https://www.klavis.ai/)\n\n**Akyn** \\- It's a platform that helps field experts and content creators monetize their knowledge by turning it into AI-agent–ready assets using MCP. [https://akyn.dev/](https://akyn.dev/)\n\n**Arcten** \\- Building AI agents that can actually take action. Their platform lets you create autonomous agents that execute complex workflows across your tools - from CRM updates to data analysis to customer outreach. They're focused on making agents reliable and production-ready for enterprise use cases. [https://www.arcten.com/](https://www.arcten.com/)\n\n**Runlayer** \\- They're tackling MCP security and access control, which is becoming critical as enterprises deploy agents at scale. The founder previously built one of the first MCP servers at Zapier. [https://www.runlayer.com/](https://www.runlayer.com/)\n\nAnyone else building in the MCP space or using these tools?

Handles both voice and video calls automatically.”\n\nSame outcome, fewer tokens, less reliance on LLM compliance.\n\nRelated reading if you’re going deeper:\n\n- [Six Patterns for Connecting LLM Agents to Stateful Tools](https://mnehmos.github.io/Mnehmos/blog/stateful-mcp-architecture) — covers the implementation side\n- [The Scalpel, Not the Hammer](https://mnehmos.github.io/Mnehmos/blog/scalpel-not-hammer) — scope constraints as token optimization\n\nThe “HTTP spec evolving in real-time” framing is apt. We’re watching tool-calling conventions crystallize.",

      "text": "Hey everyone 👋,\n\nI’ve been experimenting with the new Gemini SDKs and Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) recently. Particularly Function Calling differences.  \n  \nI wanted to break down exactly how the function calling loop works under the hood and share a workflow for connecting it to a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tool Router.\n\nI figured this might be useful for anyone trying to bridge Gemini’s native tooling with MCP servers, so sharing here.\n\n\n\n**The Core Loop: How Gemini handles tools (earlier)**\n\nIf you're coming from other ecosystems, the Gemini loop is standard but strict on data structures. It essentially works like this:\n\n1. ***Declaration*****:** You pass `FunctionDeclaration` objects (*OpenAPI*\\-like schemas) in the `GenerateContentConfig`.\n2. **The Prompt:** Gemini ingests the prompt + tool schemas.\n3. **The Stop:** Instead of text, the model halts and returns a `functionCall` object in `content.parts`.\n4. **Execution (The Missing Link):** The generic SDK *doesn't* execute code for you. You have to parse the `functionCall`, execute your local code/API, and wrap the result.\n5. **The Return:** You send a new message with `role=\"tool\"` and the structured result.\n\nThe interesting part (and often the pain point) is handling the routing logic when you have dozens of tools.\n\n**Integrating an MCP Router (new flow)**\n\nWriting manual handlers for every tool gets messy fast. This is where using an MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tool Router helps abstract the execution layer.\n\nHere is a pattern for using Google ADK with an MCP Toolset. \n\n    from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent\n    from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_toolset import McpToolset\n    from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StreamableHTTPConnectionParams\n    \n    # ... (Standard Auth Setup) ...\n    \n    # 1. Create the MCP Session\n    # In this example, we use a router that aggregates search tools\n    composio_session = composio_client.experimental.tool_router.create_session(\n        user_id=COMPOSIO_USER_ID,\n        toolkits=[\"duckduckgo\", \"google_search\"] \n    )\n    \n    # 2. Connect ADK to the MCP URL\n    composio_mcp_url = composio_session.url\n    composio_toolset = McpToolset(\n        connection_params=StreamableHTTPConnectionParams(url=composio_mcp_url)\n    )\n    \n    # 3. Inject into the Agent\n    root_agent = Agent(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-pro\",\n        name=\"research_agent\",\n        # Instruction is critical for ADK to trust the tool output\n        instruction=(\n            \"You are a helpful assistant. \"\n            \"Use the available tools to answer user queries. \"\n            \"Execute the tools directly.\"\n        ),\n        tools=[composio_toolset], # <--- The MCP Toolset\n    )\n    \n\nThis example uses a router (via Composio in this instance, but the logic applies to other   \nMCP clients) to let the agent search/plan across available tools dynamically.\n\n**Why these matters?**\n\nUsing the `McpToolset` class in Google ADK allows the agent to treat the MCP server as a unified tool interface. \n\nYou don't need to manually define the schema for every single search function; the MCP handshake handles the capability discovery.\n\n  \n**Common Pitfalls**\n\nIf you are building this out, here are a few things that tripped me up:\n\n* **Schema Strictness:** Gemini is very sensitive to parameter types. If your MCP server returns a loose schema, Gemini might hallucinate arguments. Use Enums where possible.\n* **Error Propagation:** If the MCP tool fails, *return the error as a string* in the function response. Don't crash the app. Gemini can often read the error message (\"Error: 404 not found\") and self-correct or ask the user for clarification.\n* **Routing Latency:** Passing everything through a router adds a hop. For critical, low-latency tools, native function calling might still be faster than MCP.\n\nIf you want to grab the full source code for the agent setup or see a more detailed walkthrough of the environment configuration, I wrote up a guide here: [Function Calling & MCP using Google ADK](https://medium.com/composiohq/function-calling-mcp-using-google-adk-bf861421638e?postPublishedType=repub).\n\nHas anyone else here played with Google ADK's `McpToolset` yet? I'm curious how it compares to using the standard `sse`transport with other clients like Claude Desktop.\n\n",

Context Pollution -> You burn tokens, forcing the Agent to learn *how* to use the API every single time, rather than just executing a tool that already knows how to do the job.\n2. Reliability -> LLMs are great at reasoning, but they are mediocre at following strict API syntax",
