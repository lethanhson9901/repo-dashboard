Graph-based context feels like the direction most serious coding agents need, because chunk-RAG turns into token spam fast.\n\nCurious how you handle dynamic repos: do you incrementally update the graph on file change, and do you have a strategy to avoid stale edges when refactors happen?\n\nAlso if youre comparing approaches, Ive seen some good discussions around agent context strategies here: https://www.agentixlabs.com/blog/\n\nLooks really promising.",

For context, the most popular one (LaurieWired's, 7K+ stars) has about 15 tools.\n\n## What makes this different\n\n🔧 **110 MCP tools** covering decompilation, disassembly, analysis, annotation, data types, and project management\n\n🔄 **Cross-binary function documentation transfer** — hash functions by behavior (not addresses), so when a new binary version drops, all your annotations carry over automatically. No more re-doing work across versions.\n\n⚡ **Batch operations** — analyze multiple functions/addresses in one call (93% API call reduction vs. one-at-a-time)\n\n🐳 **Headless mode + Docker** — run analysis pipelines without the GUI. `docker compose up` and you're analyzing binaries.\n\n📋 **.env configuration** — no hardcoded paths, everything configurable\n\n## Real-world usage\n\nI've been using this for Diablo 2 reverse engineering across 20+ patch versions. The function hash registry has **154K+ entries** — when a new patch drops, annotations transfer automatically instead of starting from scratch.\n\n## What's new in v2.0.0\n\n- Localhost-only binding for security (no more accidental network exposure)\n- Configurable decompile timeout\n- New label deletion tools (delete_label + batch_delete_labels)\n- .env-based configuration (no hardcoded paths)\n- Ghidra 12.0.2 support\n- Complete README rewrite with full API reference\n\n## Links\n\n- **GitHub:** https://github.com/bethington/ghidra-mcp\n- **v2.0.0 Release:** https://github.com/bethington/ghidra-mcp/releases/tag/v2.0.0\n\nPart of a broader RE toolkit — I also maintain [cheat-engine-server-python](https://github.com/bethington/cheat-engine-server-python) for dynamic analysis via MCP and [re-universe](https://github.com/bethington/re-universe) for BSim-powered binary similarity at scale.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the architecture, the hashing algorithm, or how MCP fits into RE workflows.",

I wanted to share a project I built that makes Claude really useful for organizing messy folders.\n\n**What I built:** File Organizer MCP Server - an MCP server that lets Claude automatically organize your files into categories, find duplicates, and identify space-consuming files.\n\n**How Claude helped:**\n\n* Helped me design the security architecture (path traversal protection, symlink validation)\n* Debugged the content-based duplicate detection algorithm\n* Wrote comprehensive test coverage for the security features\n* Helped optimize the file hashing to handle large directories without memory issues\n* Refined the category system to cover 12+ file types\n\n**What it does:** When connected to Claude Desktop, you can ask Claude to:\n\n* \"Organize my Downloads folder\" - automatically sorts files into Executables, Videos, Documents, Images, Audio, etc.\n* \"Find duplicate files in my Documents\" - identifies wasted space from duplicate files\n* \"Show me the 20 largest files\" - helps you find space hogs\n* \"Categorize files in this directory\" - gives you a breakdown without moving anything\n* \"Organize with dry run\" - preview changes before executing\n\n**Technical highlights:**\n\n* Security score: 9.5/10 (multi-layer path validation, resource limits, streaming operations)\n* Handles naming conflicts automatically\n* Preserves file metadata\n* Memory-safe for large directories (tested with 10,000+ files)\n\n**Free to use:** The entire project is open source (MIT license) and free. Just install via npm and configure in Claude Desktop.\n\n**Link:** [https://github.com/kridaydave/File-Organizer-MCP](https://github.com/kridaydave/File-Organizer-MCP)\n\nI'm 15 and this is my first real open-source project, so feedback would be amazing! Claude was basically my pair programming partner throughout the entire build - especially for the security hardening parts where I didn't have prior experience.\n\nHas anyone else used MCP servers for file management workflows? Curious what other use cases people have found.\n\n*Processing video sxpwhyu751hg1...*\n\n",

The other is that the SDKs don't even have full protocol compliance. I've had a PR in for months now to fully support notifications via callbacks in the Python SDK, but there's very little movement (if any at all) on merging spec compliance PRs or really PRs that are contributed by the community.

Claude Code handles more. Cursor has its own quirks. It's the classic \"standard\" that's more of a menu.\n\nWhat I've landed on is to design for the lowest common denominator (`tools` only), then treat everything else as progressive enhancement. If your server *requires* `resources` to function, you're going to have a bad time with half the clients out there.\n\nI couldn't agree more, it's incredibly frustrating that Anthropic wrote the spec but doesn't adhere to it! You'd expect their own products to be the reference implementation. Instead we're all reverse-engineering what actually works.\n\nHowever, MCP is still early and the ecosystem is moving fast. I'm hopeful the clients converge, but for now I'm just building defensively and testing against multiple clients before assuming anything works.\n\nWhat were you trying to use `instructions` and `resources` for?

      "text": "Hey r/mcp,\n\nI’ve been working on an MCP-powered “AI Research Engineer” and wanted to share it here for feedback and ideas.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/prabureddy/ai-research-agent-mcp](https://github.com/prabureddy/ai-research-agent-mcp)  \nIf it looks useful, a ⭐ on the repo really helps more MCP builders find it.\n\n**What it does**\n\nYou give it a single high-level task like:\n\n“Compare electric scooters vs bikes for my commute and prototype a savings calculator”\n\nThe agent then autonomously:\n\n* researches the web for relevant data\n* queries your personal knowledge base (notes/papers/docs) via RAG\n* writes and executes Python code (models, simulations, visualizations) in a sandbox\n* generates a structured research run: report, charts, code, data, sources\n* self-evaluates the run with quality metrics (clarity, grounding, completeness, etc.)\n\nIt’s built specifically around MCP so you can run everything from Claude Desktop (or another MCP client) with minimal setup.\n\n**Tech / architecture**\n\nMCP server in Python 3.10+\n\nTools:\n\n* `web_research`: DuckDuckGo/Brave + scraping + content extraction\n* `rag_tool`: local embeddings + ChromaDB over a `knowledge_base` directory\n* `code_sandbox`: restricted Python execution with time/memory limits\n* `workspace`: organizes each research run into its own folder (report, charts, code, data, evaluation)\n* `evaluator`: simple self-critique + quality metrics per run\n\nRAG uses local sentence-transformers by default, so you can get started without external embedding APIs.\n\n5–10 min setup: clone → install → add MCP config to Claude Desktop → restart.\n\n**Example flows**\n\n* “Deep dive: current state of EVs in 2026. Include market size, major players, growth trends, and a chart of adoption over time.”\n* “Use my notes in `knowledge_base` plus web search to analyze whether solar panels are worth it for a home in California. Build a payback-period model and visualize cashflows.”\n* “Use `web_research` \\+ RAG + code execution to build a small cost-of-ownership calculator for my commute.”\n\n**Why I’m posting here**\n\nI’d really appreciate feedback from this community on:\n\n**MCP design:**\n\n* Does the tool surface / boundaries make sense for MCP?\n* Anything you’d change about how `web_research` / `rag_tool` / `code_sandbox` are exposed?\n\n**Safety & sandboxing:**\n\n* Are there better patterns you’ve used for constrained code execution behind MCP?\n* Any obvious gotchas I’m missing around resource limits or isolation?\n\n**RAG + research UX:**\n\n* Suggestions for better chunking/query strategies in this “research agent” context?\n* Patterns you’ve used to keep the agent grounded in sources while still being autonomous?\n\n**Extensibility:**\n\n* Other tools you’d add to a “research engineer” server (data connectors, notebooks, schedulers, etc.)?\n* Thoughts on integrating with other MCP clients beyond Claude Desktop / Cursor?\n\nIf you have time to glance at the repo and tear it apart, I’d love to hear what you think. Happy to answer implementation questions or discuss MCP patterns in more detail.\n\nIf you end up trying it and think it’s useful, please consider dropping a ⭐ on the GitHub repo and sharing any ideas/issues there as well.\n\nThanks!\n\n[AI Research Engineer](https://i.redd.it/sczg2svgn3ig1.gif)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kwh5dbntczhg1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c7729e95890dce291ad8e635feca5a2805583b2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4e0nlantczhg1.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1e3f3eabe67ff887c8ca994f0090c74989621f6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zx4v3puuczhg1.png?width=4168&format=png&auto=webp&s=f798447d3b5bf5510400b832af96161488c4e25c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmec8quuczhg1.png?width=3702&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a8fe3d1c47a464c6f733cfa4c2463d25ccd5d5b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zv5hnuuczhg1.png?width=3568&format=png&auto=webp&s=162f410cc6edd2b46bd1c0a8f36a7e4a0afb9e12",

Solved it with auto-refresh - takes about 15 seconds and handles login automatically if you save credentials.\n\nWorks with Claude Desktop and Claude Code. \n\n\\`pip install texas-grocery-mcp\\[browser\\]\\`\n\n[https://github.com/mgwalkerjr95/texas-grocery-mcp](https://github.com/mgwalkerjr95/texas-grocery-mcp)\n\nIf you're in Texas and shop at HEB, give it a shot.

It incorporates user feedback across a number of areas.\n\nv1.4.0 builds on the massive architecture changes from v1.3.0 that introduced knowledge levels, automatic contradiction detection, contradiction resolution, knowledge evolution, and epistemic questions. Most memory systems are flat RAG storage, treating all memories the same, even contradictory ideas. Local Memory has a fundamentally different architecture that addresses this flaw.\n\n# New Features\n\n# Multi-Provider AI Backend\n\n* Split Architecture: Separate `EmbeddingProvider` and `ChatProvider` interfaces allow independent configuration\n* Provider Mixing: Use different providers for embeddings vs chat (e.g., Ollama for embeddings, Anthropic for chat)\n* Fallback Chains: Optional fallback providers for resilience when primary providers fail\n* Circuit Breaker Pattern: All providers include circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures\n\n# Agent Attribution\n\nTrack which agent stored or updated memories and from which machine:\n\n* Agent Type Detection: Automatically detects whether memories come from Claude Desktop, Claude Code, REST API, or other sources\n* Hostname Tracking: Records the machine hostname for multi-device memory attribution\n* HTTP Headers: REST API clients can set `X-Agent-Type`, `X-Agent-Context`, `X-Access-Scope`, and `X-Agent-Hostname` headers\n* MCP Detection: Automatically detects agent type from session ID patterns and environment variables\n\n# Default Domain with MCP Prompts\n\nOrganize memories by project with intelligent domain detection:\n\n* Default Domain: New `session.default_domain` config option (defaults to \"general-knowledge\")\n* Domain Cascade: Explicit domain > agent config file > config default\n* Agent Config File Detection: Reads domain from CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or GEMINI.md:\n   * HTML comment: `<!-- domain: project-name -->`\n   * Markdown header: `## Domain: project-name`\n   * YAML frontmatter: `domain: project-name`\n* MCP Prompts Protocol: New `prompts/list` and `prompts/get` methods\n   * `domain_selection` prompt instructs agents on domain handling\n   * Lists existing domains from database\n   * Provides usage examples\n\nYou can read the full write-up on v1.4.0 here: [https://www.localmemory.co/blog/local-memory-1.4-multi-provider-ai](https://www.localmemory.co/blog/local-memory-1.4-multi-provider-ai)\n\nYou can learn more about the knowledge hierarchy architecture released in v1.3.0 here: [https://www.localmemory.co/blog/local-memory-1.3-series-the-journey-to-world-memory](https://www.localmemory.co/blog/local-memory-1.3-series-the-journey-to-world-memory)",
