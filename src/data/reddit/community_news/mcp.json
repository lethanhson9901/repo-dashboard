Based on those conversations (and my own usage), I put together a more curated list, focusing on tools that are actually usable in daily workflows, not just cool demos.\n\nWhat matters to me:\n\n- Setup should be painless\n\n- They shouldn’t flake out\n\n- I should feel the slowdown if they’re gone\n\nHere’s the refined list.\n\n## GitHub CLI (gh): [https://cli.github.com/](https://cli.github.com/)\n\nHot take: I prefer this over the GitHub MCP server.\n\nIssues, PRs, diffs, reviews directly in terminal, scriptable, zero server overhead.\n\nFor serious repo work, CLI just feels faster and more reliable.\n\n## CodeGraphContext (CLI + MCP): [https://github.com/CodeGraphContext/CodeGraphContext](https://github.com/CodeGraphContext/CodeGraphContext)\n\nBuilds a structured graph of your codebase.\n\nFiles, functions, classes, relationships - all pre-understood.\n\nRefactors and impact analysis become much more reliable.\n\nI like that it works both as a CLI and an MCP.\n\n## Context7 MCP: [https://github.com/upstash/context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7)\n\nThis made my agents stop guessing APIs.\n\nAutomatically pulls correct documentation for libraries/frameworks.\n\nI rarely open docs tabs now.\n\n## Docker MCP: [https://github.com/docker/mcp](https://github.com/docker/mcp)\n\nGives agents runtime visibility.\n\nContainers, logs, services, not just static code.\n\nHuge for backend and infra debugging.\n\n##Firecrawl MCP / Jina Reader MCP\n\n## [https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl)\n\n## [https://github.com/jina-ai/reader](https://github.com/jina-ai/reader)\n\nClean web → structured Markdown.\n\nGreat for ingesting specs, blogs, long technical content.\n\n## Figma MCP: [https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP)\n\nDesign → structured context → better frontend output.\n\nWay better than screenshot-based prompting.\n\n## Browser DevTools MCP: [https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp)\n\nDOM, console, and network context are exposed to the agent.\n\nMakes frontend debugging workflows much smoother.\n\nCurious what others are actually using daily, not just testing.",

It gives you access to 3,000+ tested prompt templates directly inside Claude or ChatGPT — searchable by category, with fill-in variables. I used to keep a messy Notion doc of prompts I'd copy-paste in. Now I just call the MCP mid-conversation and it pulls the right template.

Ref-based interactions (e.g. “click e7”) so the model can drive flows on a live app.\n* Node side: Connect to a running Node process (PID, --inspect port, or Docker), set tracepoints/logpoints without pausing, run JS in the process, resolve source maps. Handy for debugging APIs and workers while the app runs.\n\nSo the same MCP can drive the frontend in a browser and inspect/debug the backend in Node.\n\nCLI as well\n\nYou can use it from the terminal too: browser-devtools-cli and node-devtools-cli (e.g. navigate, take screenshots, connect to a Node process with --inspector-port). Useful for scripts and quick checks without opening an IDE.\n\nLinks\n\n* Docs/site: [browser-devtools.com](http://browser-devtools.com)\n* NPM: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-devtools-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-devtools-mcp)\n* Cursor/OpenVSX Extension: [https://open-vsx.org/extension/serkan-ozal/browser-devtools-mcp-vscode](https://open-vsx.org/extension/serkan-ozal/browser-devtools-mcp-vscode)\n\nIf you’re using MCP with Cursor or Claude and want the model to actually use a browser and attach to Node backends, this might be worth a try. Happy to answer questions or hear how you’d use it.",

Agent runs --help only when it needs a specific tool.\n\nNumbers across different usage patterns:\n- Session start: 15,540 (MCP) vs 300 (CLI) - 98% savings\n- 1 tool call: 15,570 vs 910 - 94% savings\n- 100 tool calls: 18,540 vs 1,504 - 92% savings\n\nCompared against Anthropic's Tool Search too - it's better than raw MCP but still more expensive than CLI because it fetches full JSON Schema per tool.\n\nConverter is open source: https://github.com/thellimist/clihub\nFull write-up with detailed breakdowns: https://kanyilmaz.me/2026/02/23/cli-vs-mcp.html\n\nDisclosure: I built CLIHub.

That’s not mandatory. Agents can fetch tool definitions incrementally and only load what they actually need. In that setup, the claimed massive startup savings of CLI don’t automatically apply.\n\nWhere CLI really has a structural advantage is in looping scenarios. If a tool needs to be called repeatedly, the classic MCP flow forces the model to re-plan and re-emit structured calls every time. That quickly becomes expensive and slow. With a CLI, the agent can generate a small script and execute the loop outside the model. In those cases, CLI is genuinely cheaper and faster.",

With WebMCP, people can easily declare MCP Tools in their website itself that makes things unified, and much more reliable and efficient. As you can see in the demo, the agent made 100+ tool calls directly to our website, which has tools exposed using WebMCP and composed a music piece with 0% error rate in tools calls, meaning it does the right thing on website instead of clicking random buttons.",

The agent does not need to have knowledge that it is directly manipulating a website.

The data I actually needed was already there in structured JSON, one layer below the HTML. So I built **ApiTap** to skip the browser and call the API directly.\n\nApiTap captures a site's internal API calls via Chrome DevTools Protocol and saves them as replayable \"skill files.\" After one capture, your agent (or a cron job, or a CLI script) calls the API with `fetch()` — no browser needed.\n\n# Built-in decoders (no browser needed)\n\n|Site|ApiTap|Raw HTML|Savings|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Reddit|\\~630 tokens|\\~125K tokens|99.5%|\n|Wikipedia|\\~130 tokens|\\~69K tokens|99.8%|\n|Hacker News|\\~200 tokens|\\~8.6K tokens|97.7%|\n|TradingView|\\~230 tokens|\\~245K tokens|99.9%|\n\nPlus YouTube, Twitter/X, DeepWiki, and a generic fallback. Average savings: **74% across 83 tested domains.**\n\n# Three ways to use it\n\n* **MCP server** — 12 tools, works with Claude Code/Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code\n* **CLI** — `apitap read <url> --json | jq '.title'`\n* **npm package** — three direct runtime deps, zero telemetry\n\n# Quick start\n\n    npm install -g @apitap/core\n    apitap read https://news.ycombinator.com/\n\nFor MCP (Claude Code):\n\n    claude mcp add -s user apitap -- apitap-mcp\n\n# Security\n\nThis matters because the tool makes HTTP requests on behalf of AI agents. SSRF defense at 4 checkpoints (import, replay, post-DNS, post-redirect). Private IPs, cloud metadata, localhost all blocked. DNS rebinding caught. Auth encrypted with AES-256-GCM, per-install salt, never stored in skill files. **789 tests** including a full security suite. Designed after reading [Google's GTIG report on MCP attack surfaces](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/distillation-experimentation-integration-ai-adversarial-use).\n\nApiTap calls the same endpoints your browser calls — read-only, no rate-limit bypassing, no anti-bot circumvention. Endpoints that require signing or Cloudflare are flagged as \"red tier,\" not attacked.\n\n# Links\n\n* **Site:** [apitap.io](https://apitap.io)\n* **GitHub:** [github.com/n1byn1kt/apitap](https://github.com/n1byn1kt/apitap)\n* **npm:** [@apitap/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apitap/core)\n\n# License\n\nBSL 1.1 (source-available) — free for any use except reselling as a competing hosted service. Converts to Apache 2.0 in Feb 2029.\n\nHappy to answer questions. Try `apitap read` on your favorite site and let me know what breaks.",

I've been looking at this space for a bit, and the real issue is that most AI tooling doesn't even give you a choice.

Check them out!  \nWhere mine differs is it works as a purely local solution. It provisions a secure V8 sandbox in which LLM-generated code can be run, meaning we can reduce context usage from \\`N servers x M tools\\` to 2 tools - \\`search()\\` and \\`execute()\\`.   \nThis allows the LLM to do what it's good at - writing and executing code - and thus scales the ability for us to detect and use the connected tools correctly to a few search and execute steps. It also allows us to chain requests, meaning actual tool call count also drops through the floor.  \nI've tried pretty hard to make it secure - it's written in Rust, uses V8/deno\\_core, and has been subjected to several rounds of hardening efforts - and I've written up some notes in the \\`ARCHITECTURE.md\\` file regarding considerations and best practices if you're to use it.  \nI'd love to get user feedback and be able to iterate on it more - I shipped it late last night, finessed it a bit this morning before work, and am writing this on my lunchbreak. So far, real world usage for me has seen me use it to run two high-tool count MCP servers including my other mcp project, [https://github.com/postrv/narsil-mcp](https://github.com/postrv/narsil-mcp) and a propietary security tool I've been working on (a total of 154 tools) easily and with extreme token efficiency (Cloudflare note about 99% reduction in token usage in their solution - I'm yet to benchmark mine). Theoretical upper bound for connected tools is 5000 - maybe more.   \nAnyway, check it out, let me know what you think: [https://github.com/postrv/forgemax](https://github.com/postrv/forgemax)   \nThanks!

      "text": "Google released early preview of WebMCP and it's quite interesting, it adds “AI in the browser,” and it changes how agents interact with web apps at the execution layer.\n\nRight now, browser-based agents mostly parse the DOM, inspect accessibility trees, and simulate clicks or inputs. That means reasoning over presentation layers that were designed for humans. It works, but it is layout-dependent, token-heavy and brittle when UI changes.\n\nWith WebMCP, Instead of scraping and clicking, a site can expose structured tools directly inside the browser via `navigator.modelContext`.\n\nEach tool consists of:\n\n* a name\n* a description\n* a typed input schema\n* an execution handler running in page context\n\nWhen an agent loads the page, it discovers these tools and invokes them with structured parameters. Execution happens inside the active browser session, inheriting cookies, authentication state, and same-origin constraints. There is no external JSON-RPC bridge for client-side actions and no dependency on DOM selectors.\n\nArchitecturally, this turns the browser into a capability surface with explicit contracts rather than a UI. The interaction becomes schema-defined instead of layout-defined, which lowers token overhead and increases determinism while preserving session locality.\n\n[Core Architectural Components](https://preview.redd.it/vp5ne4ehaflg1.png?width=2592&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c809cda4bf6a8fd88f982e707457a33a1c1847)\n\nSecurity boundaries are also clearer. Only declared tools are visible, inputs are validated against schemas, and execution is confined to the page’s origin. It does not eliminate prompt injection risks inside tool logic, but it significantly narrows the surface compared to DOM-level automation.\n\nThis lines up with what has already been happening on the backend through MCP servers. Open-source projects like InsForge expose database and backend operations via schema-defined MCP tools.\n\nIf backend systems expose structured tools and the browser does the same, agents can move from UI manipulation to contract-based execution across the stack. WebMCP is in early preview for now but it's very promising.\n\nI wrote down the detailed breakdown [here](https://insforge.dev/blog/webmcp-browser-native-execution-model-for-ai-agents)",

      "text": "I ran into TOON a few days ago and got curious.\n\nThe idea is simple: keep the same data model as JSON but encode it in a way that is friendlier for LLM context windows. In TOONs mixed-structure benchmark, they report roughly a **40% token drop** versus pretty JSON, **with better retrieval quality.**\n\nAt the same time, JSON is not going anywhere. Its deeply baked into everything we use, especially around APIs and MCP tooling. So I wasnt thinking that this format will replace JSON. I was thinking Can I keep JSON in the backend, but send something lighter to the modelfacing side?\n\nI've written MCP servers before, so I already knew the traffic path well enough to try this quickly. I made a wrapper that runs the real MCP server as a subprocess and proxies stdio both ways. For `tools/call`, it tracks request idss, waits for the matching response, and only then tries to convert text payloads from JSON to TOON on the way back.\n\nI built it in one evening over tea, mostly as an experiment, but it worked better than I expected. In practice, payloads got noticeably smaller while the client setup stayed the same and compatible.\n\nConfig example that will save you tokens:\n\nBefore:\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"memory\": {\n          \"command\": \"memory-mcp-server-go\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nAfter (just add tooner before you command and args):\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"memory\": {\n          \"command\": \"tooner\",\n          \"args\": [\"memory-mcp-server-go\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nIts not a new protocol story. Its more like a compatibility layer experiment ; JSON stays the source format, TOON is used where token cost matters.\n\nRepo where you can install and check tool: [https://github.com/chaindead/tooner](https://github.com/chaindead/tooner)",

      "text": "GitHub: [https://github.com/JinHo-von-Choi/memento-mcp](https://github.com/JinHo-von-Choi/memento-mcp)\n\n\n\nOriginally, this was a supporting feature of another custom MCP I built.  \nBut after using it for a while, it felt solid enough to separate and release on its own.\n\nWhile using LLMs like Claude and GPT in real work—and more recently OpenClaude—there’s one infuriating thing I keep running into:  \nthey supposedly know every development document in existence, yet they can’t remember something that happened three seconds ago before the session reset.\n\nOnce you close the session, all context evaporates.\n\nThere’s a myth that goldfish only remember for three seconds. In reality, they can remember for months.  \nThese systems are worse than goldfish.\n\nYou can try stuffing markdown files with setup notes, but that has limits.  \nWhether the AI actually understands the context the way you want is still luck-based.  \nIf you run OpenClaude, you’ll see that just starting a fresh session consumes over 40,000 characters of context before you’ve done anything.  \nThat means your money just melts away.\n\nSo I tried to simulate how humans fragment memories and reconstruct them through associative structures.\n\nFor example, if someone suddenly asks me:\n\n“Hey, do you remember Mijeong?”\n\nAt first, I wouldn’t recall anyone by that name. I’d respond, “Who’s that?”\n\nThen they add:\n\n“You know, your desk partner in first grade.”\n\nThat hint is enough. A vague face begins to surface.  \n“Oh… that… yeah!”\n\nAnd if I think a bit more, related memories reappear:  \ndrawing a line on the desk and pinching if someone crossed it,  \nlending an eraser and never getting it back, and so on.\n\nThat is the core idea of Memento MCP.\n\n# 1. What is Memento MCP?\n\nMemento MCP is a mid- to long-term AI memory system built on the MCP (Model Context Protocol).\n\nIts purpose is to allow AI to remember important facts, decisions, error patterns, and procedures even after a session ends—and to naturally recall them in future sessions.\n\nThe core concept is the “Fragment.”\n\nInstead of storing entire session summaries as a single block, it splits memory into self-contained atomic units of 1–3 sentences.\n\nWhen retrieving, it pulls only the relevant atoms.\n\n# 2. Why Fragment Units?\n\nStoring entire session summaries causes two major problems:\n\n* First, unrelated content gets injected into the context window. It wastes tokens and costs money. I don’t have money to waste.\n* Second, as time passes, extracting only what’s needed from large summaries becomes difficult.\n\nA fragment contains a single fact, decision, or error pattern.\n\nFor example:  \n“When Redis Sentinel connection fails, check for a missing REDIS\\_PASSWORD environment variable first. The NOAUTH error is evidence.”\n\nThat’s one fragment.\n\nOnly the necessary facts are retrieved.\n\n# 3. Six Fragment Types\n\nEach type has its own default importance and decay rate.\n\n* fact: Unchanging truth. “This project uses Node.js 20.”\n* decision: A record of choice. “Connection pool maximum set to 20.”\n* error: The anatomy of failure. “pg fails local connection without ssl:false.” (Never forgotten.)\n* preference: The outline of identity. “Code comments should be written in Korean.” (Never forgotten.)\n* procedure: A recurring ritual. “Deployment: test → build → push → apply.”\n* relation: A connection between things. “The auth module depends on Redis.”\n\nPreferences and errors are never forgotten.  \nPreferences define who you are.  \nError patterns may return at any time.\n\n# 4. Three-Layer Cascade Search\n\nMemory retrieval uses three layers, queried in order.  \nIf a fast layer finds the answer, slower layers are skipped.\n\n* L1 (Redis Inverted Index): Keyword-based direct lookup. Microseconds. Find fragments instantly via intersection of “redis” and “NOAUTH.”\n* L2 (PostgreSQL Metadata): Structured queries combining topic, type, and keywords. Indexed millisecond-level.\n* L3 (pgvector Semantic Search): Meaning-based search via OpenAI embeddings. Understands that “authentication failure” and “NOAUTH” mean the same thing. Slowest, but deepest.\n\nRedis and OpenAI are optional.  \nIf absent, the system works without those layers.  \nPostgreSQL alone provides baseline functionality.\n\n# 5. TTL Layers — The Temperature of Memory\n\nFragments move between hot, warm, and cold based on usage frequency.\n\nhot (frequently referenced)  \n→ warm (silent for a while)  \n→ cold (long dormant)  \n→ deleted when TTL expires\n\nHowever, once referenced again, they immediately return to hot.\n\nHuman long-term memory works similarly.  \nIf unused, it fades—but once recalled, it becomes vivid again.\n\n# 6. Summary of 11 MCP Tools\n\n* context: Load core memory at session start\n* remember: Store fragment\n* recall: Three-layer cascade search\n* reflect: Condense session into fragments at session end\n* forget: Delete fragment (for resolved errors)\n* link: Create causal relationships between fragments (caused\\_by, resolved\\_by, etc.)\n* amend: Modify fragment content (preserve ID and relations)\n* graph\\_explore: Explore causal chains (trace root causes)\n* memory\\_stats: Storage statistics\n* memory\\_consolidate: Periodic maintenance (decay, merge, contradiction detection)\n* tool\\_feedback: Feedback on retrieval quality\n\n# 7. Recommended Usage Flow\n\n1. Session start → context() to load memory\n2. During work → When important decisions/errors/procedures occur: remember() → When past experience is needed: recall() → After resolving an error: forget(error) + remember(solution procedure)\n3. Session end → reflect() to persist session content\n\n# 8. Tech Stack\n\n* Node.js 20+\n* PostgreSQL 14+ (pgvector extension)\n* Redis 6+ (optional)\n* OpenAI Embedding API (optional)\n* Gemini Flash (optional, for contradiction detection in memory\\_consolidate)\n* MCP Protocol 2025-11-25\n\n# 9. How to Run\n\n1. Initialize PostgreSQL schema\n\nbash  \npsql -U postgres -c \"CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;\"  \npsql -U postgres -d memento -f lib/memory/memory-schema.sql\n\nStart the server:\n\nnpm install  \nnpm start\n\nAdd the following to your MCP client configuration:\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"memento\": {\n          \"url\": \"http://localhost:56332/mcp\",\n          \"headers\": {\n            \"Authorization\": \"Bearer your-secret-key\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n# 10. Why I Built This\n\nWhile using Claude at work, I felt it was inefficient to repeat the same context every day.\n\nI tried putting notes into system prompts, but that had clear limitations.  \nAs fragments increased, management became impossible. Search broke down. Old and new information conflicted.\n\nWhat frustrated me most was having to repeat explanations and setups endlessly.\n\nThe whole point of using AI was to make my life easier.  \nYet it would claim authentication wasn’t configured—when it was.  \nIt would insist setup files were missing—when they were clearly there.  \nSome sessions would stubbornly refuse to do things they were fully capable of doing.  \nYou could logically dismantle its resistance and make it comply—but only for that session.  \nStart a new one, and the same cycle repeats.\n\nIt felt like training a top graduate from an elite university who suffers from a daily brain reset.\n\nTo solve this frustration, I designed a system that:\n\n* Decomposes memory into atomic fragments\n* Retrieves memory hierarchically\n* Naturally forgets over time\n\nJust as humans are creatures of forgetting,  \nthis system aims for memory that includes “appropriate forgetting.”\n\nFeedback, issues, and PRs are welcome.",

              "text": " Contradiction detection runs as step 7 of the memory\\_consolidate pipeline, not at reflect() write time. It's an incremental, asynchronous process -- here's the actual flow:\n\n  When reflect() writes new fragments, nothing special happens at that moment regarding contradictions. The fragments are just stored. The real work happens later when memory\\_consolidate runs (either manually triggered or on a\n\n  schedule).\n\n  The detection pipeline works in three stages:\n\n  1. Candidate selection via embedding similarity -- It pulls fragments created since the last contradiction check (tracked via a Redis timestamp key). For each new fragment, it queries pgvector for same-topic fragments with\n\ncosine similarity > 0.85. This threshold is deliberate -- fragments need to be talking about essentially the same thing to be contradiction candidates. Different topics or loosely related content never reaches the judgment\n\nstep. The query is bounded to 3 candidates per new fragment, and 20 new fragments per consolidation cycle, so this doesn't explode.\n\n  2. Gemini Flash adjudication -- Each high-similarity pair gets sent to Gemini Flash with a strict prompt: \"Are these two fragments mutually incompatible claims about the same subject?\" The prompt explicitly distinguishes\n\ncontradiction from complementary information -- \"similar but supplementary is NOT contradiction. Information updates over time ARE contradictions (old info vs new info).\" Temperature is set to 0.1 to minimize creative\n\ninterpretation. Response is forced into {contradicts: boolean, reasoning: string} JSON.\n\n  3. Time-logic resolution -- This is where it gets interesting. When a contradiction is confirmed, the system doesn't just flag it -- it resolves it automatically using temporal ordering. The newer fragment wins. The older\n\nfragment's importance gets halved (importance \\* 0.5), and a superseded\\_by link is created from old to new. The older fragment isn't deleted -- it's demoted. It'll naturally sink to cold tier and eventually expire through\n\nnormal TTL mechanics. Anchor fragments (is\\_anchor=true) are exempt from the importance demotion, so truly critical knowledge survives even if contradicted.\n\n\n\n  The critical path concern you raised is valid -- this does depend on Gemini being available. If Gemini is down, the contradiction check silently fails and those pairs go unchecked until the next consolidation cycle. The system\n\n  degrades to \"latest write wins at recall time\" through the recency component of the ranking function (0.4 weight), which is a reasonable fallback but not as clean as explicit contradiction resolution.\n\n  The 0.85 similarity threshold is the real tuning knob here. Too low and you get false positives flooding Gemini with complementary fragments. Too high and genuine contradictions with different wording slip through. In practice,\n\n  contradictions about the same subject (\"max connections is 20\" vs \"max connections is 50\") tend to land well above 0.85 because the embedding space clusters them tightly.\n\n  One thing worth noting: amend() has a separate supersedes parameter that lets the AI explicitly mark a fragment as replacing another, bypassing the consolidation pipeline entirely. So there are two paths -- explicit replacement\n\n  at write time, and automatic detection after the fact.",

Having memories naturally decay unless reinforced mirrors how working memory actually functions. The cascade search ordering (keyword → metadata → semantic) is also smart — you'd be surprised how often a simple keyword hit at L1 eliminates an expensive embedding lookup.\n\nCurious about fragment linking in practice — do your agents actually use `link()` proactively, or does it mostly happen through `reflect()` at session end?",

              "text": "Honest answer: agents rarely call link() on their own initiative. In practice, linking happens through three paths, roughly in order of frequency:\n\n  1. reflect() auto-linking at session end — When reflect() creates a batch of typed fragments (decisions, errors, procedures), an internal \\_autoLinkSessionFragments() step runs that connects them with rule-based heuristics. Error\n\nfragments get resolved\\_by links to procedure fragments from the same session. Decisions get linked to related procedures. The summary fragment gets related links to everything else. This is where most of the graph structure\n\nactually comes from.\n\n  2. remember() with linkedTo parameter — When the AI stores a new fragment, it can pass existing fragment IDs to link immediately. This works better than you'd expect because recall() returns fragment IDs in its results, so the\n\nAI often has relevant IDs in its context when it decides to store something new. \"I just found this error pattern via recall, and now I'm storing the fix — link them.\" That chain happens naturally.\n\n  3. Explicit link() calls — Rare in practice. The AI almost never stops mid-task to think \"I should create a relationship between these two fragments.\" It happens occasionally during graph\\_explore workflows where the AI is\n\nactively tracing causality, but organically? Almost never.\n\n\n\n  The honest gap right now is reflect() itself. Currently it requires a manual prompt before session end — \"save the session\" or equivalent. I hook context() at session start so the AI loads its memory automatically, but the\n\n  symmetry breaks at session close. If the session drops unexpectedly (timeout, network, client crash), reflect never fires and that session's structural links never get created. The individual remember() fragments survive, but the\n\n  cross-referencing that reflect provides is lost.\n\n  I'm actively working on automatic reflect — the leading approach is a hybrid: attempt a Gemini-generated summary from session activity metadata on session close, and if that fails, flag the session as \"unreflected\" so the next\n\n  context() call prompts the AI to do it retroactively. But this is unsolved as of today.",

The Mijeong analogy is great, that hint-triggered cascading recall is exactly what makes associative memory useful vs just storing everything in a flat list.

It's a smart play in the \"selling shovels\" approach, but this is way, way too oversaturated right now.\n\nLiterally writing an MCP server in another window right now, and I'm not sure what this would give me. It may help for a \"I want an MCP server but I don't know which one\" type question, but personally I'd ask Claude to do the work to pick one for me, rather than go down this route.\n\nEither way, good luck to your friend!",

              "text": "That's a fair point about the marketplace saturation. I actually built an MCP server recently that solves a specific workflow gap I kept running into with Claude Code.\n\nThe problem was the constant copy-paste loop between Claude and Codex windows when I wanted to bounce ideas, get parallel plans, or validate approaches. So I built Claude Co-Commands - an MCP server that adds three collaboration commands directly to Claude Code:\n\n- `/co-brainstorm` for bouncing ideas and getting alternative perspectives from Codex\n- `/co-plan` to generate parallel plans and compare approaches  \n- `/co-validate` for getting that staff engineer review before finalizing\n\nThe MCP approach means it integrates cleanly with Claude Code's existing command system. Instead of running terminal commands or switching windows, you just use the slash commands and Claude handles the collaboration with Codex automatically.\n\nIt's not trying to be a marketplace, just solving that specific workflow friction point. If you're writing MCP servers, you might find the approach interesting - it's basically turning the copy-paste loop into a clean command interface.\n\nhttps://github.com/SnakeO/claude-co-commands",

      "text": "I've been developing [MCPwner](https://github.com/Pigyon/MCPwner), an MCP server that lets your AI agents auto-pentest security targets. \n\nWhile most people are waiting for the latest flagship models to do the heavy lifting, I built this to orchestrate **GPT-4o** and **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** models that are older by today's standards but, when properly directed, are more than capable of finding deep architectural flaws using MCPwner.\n\nI recently pointed MCPwner at **OpenClaw**, and it successfully identified several 0-days that have now been issued official advisories. It didn't just find \"bugs\". it found critical logic bypasses and injection points that standard scanners completely missed.\n\n### The Findings:\n[Environment Variable Injection](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-82g8-464f-2mv7)\n\n\n[ACP permission auto-approval bypass](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-7jx5-9fjg-hp4m)\n\n\n[File-existence oracle info disclosure](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-6c9j-x93c-rw6j)\n\n\n[safeBins stdin-only bypass](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-4685-c5cp-vp95)\n\nThe project is still heavily in progress, but the fact that it's already pulling in multiple vulnerabilities and other CVEs I reported using mid-tier/older models shows its strength over traditional static analysis.\n\nIf you're building in the offensive AI space I’d love for you to put this through its paces. I'm actively looking for contributors to help sharpen the scanning logic and expand the toolkitPRs and feedback are more than welcome.\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/Pigyon/MCPwner](https://github.com/Pigyon/MCPwner)",

      "text": "I maintain **Bifrost**, and once you go past \\~10 MCP servers, things start getting messy.\n\nFirst issue: tool name collisions. Different MCP servers expose tools with the same names. For example, a `search_files` tool from a filesystem server and another from Google Drive. The LLM sometimes picks the wrong one, and the user gets weird results.  \nWhat worked for us was simple: namespace the tools. So now it’s `filesystem.search_files` vs `gdrive.search_files`. The LLM can clearly see where each tool is coming from.\n\nThen there’s schema bloat. If you have \\~15 servers, you might end up with 80+ tools. If you dump every schema into every request, your context window explodes and token costs go up fast.  \nOur fix was tool filtering per request. We use virtual keys that decide which tools an agent can see. So each agent only gets the relevant tools instead of the full catalog.\n\nAnother pain point is the connection lifecycle. MCP servers can crash or just hang, and requests end up waiting on dead servers.  \nWe added health checks before routing. If a server fails checks, we temporarily exclude it and bring it back once it recovers.\n\nOne more thing that helped a lot once we had 3+ servers: **Code Mode**. Instead of exposing every tool schema, the LLM writes TypeScript to orchestrate tools. That alone cut token usage by 50%+ for us.\n\nIf you want to check it out:  \nCode: [https://git.new/bifrost](https://git.new/bifrost)  \nDocs: [https://getmax.im/docspage](https://getmax.im/docspage)",
