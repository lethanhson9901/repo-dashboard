No more re-doing work across versions.\n\n⚡ **Batch operations** — analyze multiple functions/addresses in one call (93% API call reduction vs. one-at-a-time)\n\n🐳 **Headless mode + Docker** — run analysis pipelines without the GUI. `docker compose up` and you're analyzing binaries.\n\n📋 **.env configuration** — no hardcoded paths, everything configurable\n\n## Real-world usage\n\nI've been using this for Diablo 2 reverse engineering across 20+ patch versions. The function hash registry has **154K+ entries** — when a new patch drops, annotations transfer automatically instead of starting from scratch.\n\n## What's new in v2.0.0\n\n- Localhost-only binding for security (no more accidental network exposure)\n- Configurable decompile timeout\n- New label deletion tools (delete_label + batch_delete_labels)\n- .env-based configuration (no hardcoded paths)\n- Ghidra 12.0.2 support\n- Complete README rewrite with full API reference\n\n## Links\n\n- **GitHub:** https://github.com/bethington/ghidra-mcp\n- **v2.0.0 Release:** https://github.com/bethington/ghidra-mcp/releases/tag/v2.0.0\n\nPart of a broader RE toolkit — I also maintain [cheat-engine-server-python](https://github.com/bethington/cheat-engine-server-python) for dynamic analysis via MCP and [re-universe](https://github.com/bethington/re-universe) for BSim-powered binary similarity at scale.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the architecture, the hashing algorithm, or how MCP fits into RE workflows.",

      "text": "I’ve been building with MCP across a few integrations and the pattern is pretty consistent: getting an MCP server running is straightforward, but operating tool access safely gets hard fast once you have more than a couple servers/clients.\n\nA few things that seem to become real problems earlier than people expect:\n\n1) Secrets sprawl first.\nAs soon as credentials live on the client side (agent configs, local env vars, copied tokens), you start accumulating shared keys, inconsistent scopes, and painful rotation. It’s not just a security issue, it turns into reliability and governance overhead.\n\n2) Permissions need to be tool-level, not server-level.\nMost risk is concentrated in a small set of tools (write/delete/outbound actions). Treating an entire MCP server as a single trust boundary is too coarse. You want identity-aware capability filtering per tool, ideally per user/agent/client/environment.\n\n3) Approvals are an operational control, not a UX feature.\nIf you don’t have a clean way to pause and approve a subset of high-risk calls, teams either never expose useful write tools or accept a scary blast radius. In practice you need a stop, review, continue path that’s consistent across tools.\n\n4) Audit is what makes it a system instead of a demo.\nWhen agents touch real systems, you need to answer: who invoked what, with what parameters, what policy decision was applied, and what happened. You also need to do it without leaking sensitive data into logs.\n\n5) MCP server sprawl becomes an ops problem.\nRouting, lifecycle management, quotas/rate limits, versioning, and observability become harder to solve piecemeal per server.\n\nNet takeaway: MCP lowers the cost of connecting tools, but it raises the importance of a centralized control layer for policy, secrets, approvals, and audit across every tool call.\n\nIf you’ve run MCP in production, what did you centralize first? And what do you wish you had centralized earlier?",

          "text": "Of the five issues listed, #3 (Approvals) and #4(Audit) should primarily happen at the level of the platform consuming the MCP servers. They are not MCP-level problems. The same issues exist with any protocol used to connect from an agentic system to other business applications. And the context needed for approvals and for meaningful audit is broader in scope than any one MCP server or tool call. Of course, an MCP Gateway handling outbound MCP traffic from the agent clients can provide meaningful observability, but that's not the same as a meaningful audit.   \nIssue #2 (Permissions) -- here you raise a really interesting point. The protocol chooses to do permissions based on user identity. The latest MCP spec mandates OAuth2.1 as the auth method. This makes sense for systems with end user accounts. Since OAuth has scope definitions custom to each auth provider (eg: read\\_only, read\\_write), it can inherit the same mechanisms that have been built over the years for API permissioning. This seems sensible to me. If API keys are being used, many systems also have the ability to treat these like service accounts with scoped capabilities.  \nIf you have many clients and a few MCP servers, then issue #1 (secrets sprawl) is a problem. But not if you are using OAuth2.1 for your MCP server (no API keys being distributed anywhere). From my perspective, the MCP protocol is solving this problem via OAuth2.1 with DCR/PKCE.  \nIf you've got AI agents running automation and connecting to many MCP servers, then I'd focus on issue #5 (MCP server sprawl). In our company, [Thunk.AI](http://Thunk.AI), that's been what we centralized first. That's because we're deploying an AI automation platform in an enterprise environment. Strong requirement to have controls over whose AI agents connect to which business applications, separation of dev/test/prod environments with different keys, rate limiting, token consumption metrics tracking, etc. Our agentic automation service sends all outbound agentic traffic through an AI Gateway (we use a self-hosted instance of LiteLLM). The agentic automation service is responsible for approvals, audits, subsetting tools, overall AI agent reliability and orchestration. The AI gateway is an admin control point and responsible for protocol-level traffic management. As an aside, we see some AI gateways mixing protocol/traffic-level functionality with higher-level semantic functionality (guardrails, agents, etc) and think that's a very bad idea. But that's a whole other topic.",

The latter will get implemented as a platform service that acts as an AI gateway.   \nIt is not yet clear how tightly coupled the platform and the gateway need to be. As an analogy, in pre-AI apps, the application platform is agnostic to the API gateway and vice versa. But the API gateway tends to do very low level things that need zero application semantics. The needs of the AI gateway are still fuzzy and it might well be that it needs to be closer to the application platform.",

For solo-devs/small teams/startups, I think cost (or by extension context limiting and thus increasing speed) is more important than the actual security.

I wanted to share a project I built that makes Claude really useful for organizing messy folders.\n\n**What I built:** File Organizer MCP Server - an MCP server that lets Claude automatically organize your files into categories, find duplicates, and identify space-consuming files.\n\n**How Claude helped:**\n\n* Helped me design the security architecture (path traversal protection, symlink validation)\n* Debugged the content-based duplicate detection algorithm\n* Wrote comprehensive test coverage for the security features\n* Helped optimize the file hashing to handle large directories without memory issues\n* Refined the category system to cover 12+ file types\n\n**What it does:** When connected to Claude Desktop, you can ask Claude to:\n\n* \"Organize my Downloads folder\" - automatically sorts files into Executables, Videos, Documents, Images, Audio, etc.\n* \"Find duplicate files in my Documents\" - identifies wasted space from duplicate files\n* \"Show me the 20 largest files\" - helps you find space hogs\n* \"Categorize files in this directory\" - gives you a breakdown without moving anything\n* \"Organize with dry run\" - preview changes before executing\n\n**Technical highlights:**\n\n* Security score: 9.5/10 (multi-layer path validation, resource limits, streaming operations)\n* Handles naming conflicts automatically\n* Preserves file metadata\n* Memory-safe for large directories (tested with 10,000+ files)\n\n**Free to use:** The entire project is open source (MIT license) and free. Just install via npm and configure in Claude Desktop.\n\n**Link:** [https://github.com/kridaydave/File-Organizer-MCP](https://github.com/kridaydave/File-Organizer-MCP)\n\nI'm 15 and this is my first real open-source project, so feedback would be amazing! Claude was basically my pair programming partner throughout the entire build - especially for the security hardening parts where I didn't have prior experience.\n\nHas anyone else used MCP servers for file management workflows? Curious what other use cases people have found.\n\n*Processing video sxpwhyu751hg1...*\n\n",

How do you handle one server's auth failing mid-workflow?\n\nWe ended up supporting vault integration (HashiCorp, AWS Secrets Manager) for key management, which helps but doesn't solve the agent-as-user identity problem.\n\nFor Bifrost specifically, we let you configure auth per MCP server connection and handle token lifecycle at the gateway level. Agents just call tools, gateway manages the OAuth dance.\n\nDocs: [https://docs.getbifrost.ai/mcp/overview](https://docs.getbifrost.ai/mcp/overview)\n\nStill feels like there should be a cleaner pattern though.

The other is that the SDKs don't even have full protocol compliance. I've had a PR in for months now to fully support notifications via callbacks in the Python SDK, but there's very little movement (if any at all) on merging spec compliance PRs or really PRs that are contributed by the community. I've offered to help with code review in the dev discord when that issue was brought but haven't really heard anything. They seem swamped.",

Claude Code handles more. Cursor has its own quirks. It's the classic \"standard\" that's more of a menu.\n\nWhat I've landed on is to design for the lowest common denominator (`tools` only), then treat everything else as progressive enhancement. If your server *requires* `resources` to function, you're going to have a bad time with half the clients out there.\n\nI couldn't agree more, it's incredibly frustrating that Anthropic wrote the spec but doesn't adhere to it! You'd expect their own products to be the reference implementation. Instead we're all reverse-engineering what actually works.\n\nHowever, MCP is still early and the ecosystem is moving fast. I'm hopeful the clients converge, but for now I'm just building defensively and testing against multiple clients before assuming anything works.\n\nWhat were you trying to use `instructions` and `resources` for?

      "text": "About 4 months ago I was working on a side project - a Telegram chat agent. I had a Telegram Bot API that I'd built a while back, running as a plain HTTP server. So what I wanted is to re-expose some of those API methods as MCP tools and give them to my agent I was working on.\n\nThe thing is, I didn't want to give the agent access to everything. Just a few specific methods, and I wanted to tune some parameters. I looked around for existing solutions and found a couple of projects that could solve my problems, but not fully. So I had an option to either write yet another MCP server and end up doing this again for my other APIs and then support all of them or build some generic solution. So this is how I ended up building my own MCP Gateway.\n\nNow, the way it works: you point it at your existing backends - existing MCP servers (over streamable HTTP), OpenAPI specs, and plain HTTP APIs - and it exposes them as a single MCP endpoint (or multiple ones if you wish). And if you’ve got an stdio-only MCP server, you can still plug it in via the Adapter.\n\nThe workflow is pretty straightforward:\n\n1. Connect your backends (MCP servers, OpenAPI specs, or HTTP APIs) as sources\n2. Create a profile and pick which tools you want to expose\n3. Profile gets you a new stable URL - that's your public MCP endpoint\n4. The UI generates a config you can paste straight into the agent / system of your choice\n5. You can now dynamically enable / disable tools, transform parameters, and do other fun stuff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/19rpzpu8cqgg1.png?width=1750&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1da42d2117cdcd447a85da58b8b6db3ed308645\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ot2vlhz9cqgg1.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=517c75935b85284928224238db8953a8e6c53c8b\n\nFor most of the things you can do it via the UI, but you can also do it directly with just configs, if you like. For example, the simplest case is when you want to re-expose your existing OpenAPI-based server, so you do it like this:\n\n    servers:\n      billing:\n        type: openapi\n        spec: https://billing.internal/openapi.json\n        baseUrl: https://billing.internal\n        autoDiscover: true\n\nEvery operation in that spec becomes an MCP tool. No SDK, no wrapper code.\n\nSo, to summarize, my MCP Gateway is like a layer in front of your servers that handles aggregation, auth, and routing. If you've used API gateways like Kong or AWS API Gateway, same idea but for MCP. Some of my friends who used it described the experience as \"ngrok for MCP with some neat features on top\".\n\nIt's written in Rust, MIT licensed, Docker-ready. There's a web UI for managing profiles, sources, and API keys, and more.\n\nYou can learn more here: [https://github.com/unrelated-ai/mcp-gateway](https://github.com/unrelated-ai/mcp-gateway)\n\nIf you have questions I'm happy to answer in the comments. Also looking for contributors if this is something that interests you.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcuhpb14cqgg1.png?width=1778&format=png&auto=webp&s=92d9b9a8c57b7482adec41be0aa9d9fd86280d30\n\n",

Currently, you can add four types of them. If you select MCP Server or Adapter on the \"Sources\" page, the UI wizard will prompt you to enter auth details for that particular upstream. You can also do the same programmatically, the UI is fully optional, but I'm referring to it as a quick way to play with the gateway.\n\nThen there's downstream-related authentication: in the first screenshot above, you can see the \"Auth\" and \"Auth Help\" buttons. This is where you can configure how auth options for your specific profile should work. You can disable it entirely, switch to using gateway-issued API keys, or use JWT/OIDC if needed. Speaking of tokens: you can issue them yourself at the tenant level (which means you can use one token to access any profile you create), or you can take a more granular approach and issue profile-level tokens. You can do it in a few clicks in the UI, so just give it a try you'll like it.\n\nThere is also a big topic around auth identity. I haven't decided exactly how it should work just yet, so as of today the work is still in progress. I'll update the community later.",

Does the end user ask the LLM to store a memory and there is a store memory tool?  Or does the Memory MCP Server have its own web interface or something like that where the end user has to add the \"memory\" them selves and then the memory is stored in a graph database or something similar?\n\nThen how is the LLM encouraged to use the Memory MCP Server?  I'm guessing the Memory MCP Server is handed off like any other tool, but does the LLM have to be directed to use the specific Memory MCP Server, by saying something like \"Do you remember that time...\"\n\nAny friendly direction on this would be greatly appreciated.",
