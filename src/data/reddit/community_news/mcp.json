The reason why I did this is because for a free user local llms are not so efficient in tool use as most machines can only host smaller models.

You have to be very careful at times and build safe guards into your tools. For example in my mcp server I had a read\\_file tool. simple except for the fact it read a file much larger than it should have, the context immediately jumped to 800k tokens and the chat was unrecoverable.\n\nfrom there i started to build in hard coded limits like limiting the max lines readable to 500 for read\\_file. Then when we build composite tools, we can think of different ways to do them. My favorite is enum menus where tools can be more modular and one tool can serve many different functions.\n\nThen we can also add in batch tools.  \nbatch\\_read\\_files  \nbatch\\_string\\_replace  \nbatch\\_read\\_lines  \netc\n\nthis allow us to turn 20 calls into 1. A time saver and a context saver for the misc info we get from tool outputs.",

This is a demonstration of it using playwright:  \n[https://enact.tools/blog/claude-code-superpowers](https://enact.tools/blog/claude-code-superpowers)\n\nEnact uses the \"skills\" standard but also defines a command to be executed as proposed here: https://github.com/anthropics/skills/issues/157 \n\nBasically you can define any tools `user/my-tools/playwright` or whatever and publish them so they can be searched semantically and executed via cli.\n\nI still believe MCP is the future regarding interfacing with agents, but the main tools in your context window will be for searching, registering and executing tools.",

      "text": "Been using Claude with Microsoft 365 via MCP and hit two frustrations:\n\n**Problem 1: Context bloat**\n\nThe popular MS Graph MCPs expose 30-40 specialized tools like `list-mail-messages`, `create-calendar-event`, `get-user`, etc. That's ~12KB of context eaten up before you even start talking. Claude already knows the Graph API - it doesn't need 37 hand-holding tools.\n\n**Problem 2: Multi-tenant switching sucks**\n\nI manage multiple M365 tenants (work, clients, personal). Every time I wanted to query a different tenant, I had to call `select-account`, wait, then make my request. Constantly switching context.\n\n**The fix:**\n\nForked the Softeria MCP and stripped it down to 7 tools:\n- `login`, `logout`, `verify-login` (auth)\n- `list-accounts`, `select-account`, `remove-account` (account management)\n- `graph-request` (one tool for ALL Graph API calls)\n\nThe `graph-request` tool takes an `accountId` parameter, so you can query any tenant directly without switching:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"endpoint\": \"/me/messages\",\n  \"accountId\": \"client-tenant-abc123\"\n}\n```\n\nQuery work and personal calendars in the same conversation. No switching dance.\n\n~1KB context instead of ~12KB. Same capabilities.\n\n**Repo:** https://github.com/ForITLLC/forit-microsoft-graph\n\nMIT licensed, fork of Softeria's work. Just a different philosophy - less is more.\n\nAnyone else running into context bloat issues with MCPs?\n",

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nKept looking for a **deep research** workflow that acts like a good analyst team aka : gather sources, generate hypotheses, challenges/critiques, and stitch a crisp answer. \n\nMost DR products (or modes) end up with 1-shot DR.   \n  \nNot to forget :   \n(a) single model hallucinations (made up links anyone?)  \nor   \n(b) a pile of unstructured notes with lil accountability\n\nI often keep running the output copy pasting from one model to another to validate the hypothesis and synthesis. \n\nthe current work is inspired a ton by Karpathy’s work on the LLM-council repo - over the holidays, built **Counsel MCP Server**: an MCP server that runs **structured debates** across a **family of LLM agents** to **research + synthesize** with fewer silent errors. The council emphasizes: a debuggable artifact trail and a MCP integration surface that can be plugged in into any assistant.\n\nIf you want to try it, there’s a **playground assistant** with Counsel MCP already wired up: [**https://counsel.getmason.io**](https://counsel.getmason.io/)\n\n# What it does ?\n\n* You submit a research question or task.\n* The server runs a structured loop with multiple LLM agents (examples: propose, critique, synthesize, optional judge).\n* You get back artifacts that make it inspectable:\n   * **final** synthesis (answer or plan)\n   * **critiques** (what got challenged and why)\n   * **decision record** (assumptions, key risks, what changed)\n   * **trace** (run timeline, optional per-agent messages, cost/latency)\n\nThis is not just \"N models voting.” in a round robin pattern - the council will do structured arguments and critique aimed at better research outcomes.\n\n# Have 3 top of mind questions - any feedback here would be great?\n\n1. What’s a useful API variant here ?\n   * A single `counsel.research()` or `counsel.debate()` tool plus resources?\n   * Or multiple tools (run, stream, explain, get)?\n2. What’s the right pattern for research runs that take 10–60 seconds?\n   * streaming events\n   * polling resources\n   * returning everything inline\n3. What should the final artifact contain?\n   * final output only\n   * final + critiques\n   * full trace + decision record\n   * what’s the minimum that still makes this debuggable and trustworthy?\n\nGive it a spin & tell me what gives\n\nPlayground: [**https://counsel.getmason.io**](https://counsel.getmason.io/)\n\nIf you try it, I’d love to hear any feedback good, blahhhh, meh?",

Interestingly, we're seeing this a lot as critical for multi-agent MCP systems.  \n  \nHow are you currently validating that the debate structure produces reliable results, and what's been your approach to debugging when the council output is unexpected?\n\n  \nthought of throwing in some views in here  \n===================================  \n  \nOur approach has 3 layers:\n\n\\#1 - Validation: Strict JSON schemas per phase, mandatory evidence citations (no unsourced claims), and a locked Crux Registry after the Attack phase to prevent semantic drift. We validate at the structure level (schema compliant) and semantic level (crux stability, agreement thresholds per tension).\n\n\\#2 - Debugging: Every debate produces an append-only artifact trail - transcripts per role/round, the exact context each role saw (including argument shuffle order), schema repair attempts, and crux evolution. When output is out of bounds (unexpected), we trace back through - which role drove the conclusion   \n→ what evidence was cited   \n→ whether the crux positions shifted unexpectedly   \n→ whether validation repair led to loss in nuance.\n\n\\#3 - We also support human-in-the-loop intervention (pause, steer, modify\\_tensions) for real-time course correction when you see the debate heading somewhere wrong. the \"debuggable artifact trail\" you talk abt is what this is optimized for - a multi-agent debate synthesis is only trustworthy if you can audit the reasoning chain.",

IMO this pattern is exactly right, and it maps to what I’ve found building MCP servers from the other side (implementation rather than analysis).\n\nThe key insight: **tool descriptions are the only guaranteed injection point**. System prompts can be overridden, context windows fill up, but tool descriptions are read fresh every time the model considers calling that tool.\n\nYour pattern catalog maps cleanly to what I’ve implemented:\n\n|Your Pattern                |Implementation Reality                                                                                                                       |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|**Prerequisite Enforcement**|I call these “composite tools” — instead of hoping the LLM chains correctly, bundle the workflow into one tool that does steps 1-3 internally|\n|**Tiered Fallback**         |Fuzzy validation with ranked suggestions — don’t just reject bad input, return “did you mean X?”                                             |\n|**Context Injection**       |“Dynamic loader” pattern — one tool that loads only the context needed for the current operation                                             |\n|**Negative Examples**       |Essential for anti-hallucination — “this tool does NOT create characters, use create_character for that”                                     |\n\nThe Salesforce 500-word description is the brute force approach. It works, but there’s an architectural alternative: **move workflow logic into the tool itself**. Instead of telling the LLM “you MUST query both VoiceCall AND VideoCall first,” make that the tool’s internal behavior. The description becomes: “Summarizes conversation transcripts. Handles both voice and video calls automatically.”\n\nSame outcome, fewer tokens, less reliance on LLM compliance.\n\nRelated reading if you’re going deeper:\n\n- [Six Patterns for Connecting LLM Agents to Stateful Tools](https://mnehmos.github.io/Mnehmos/blog/stateful-mcp-architecture) — covers the implementation side\n- [The Scalpel, Not the Hammer](https://mnehmos.github.io/Mnehmos/blog/scalpel-not-hammer) — scope constraints as token optimization\n\nThe “HTTP spec evolving in real-time” framing is apt.

The problem, which this graph shows, is that as the document set grows, the lest comprehensive and accurate the reasoning gets.  This is basically saying our current rag strategies are deficient.   Better strategies perform better with large documents but they all get worse the more docs you hold.\n\nI see this all the time with people building agents and it usually results in a custom fine tuned tag solution for a use case.  So a specific rag for processing text in a textbook versus a different rag for processing text from a novel.  This creates a ton of work as each category of data needs a tailored solution which is not engineering scalable.",

It captures pixel-accurate sizing, spacing, typography, and layout, then generates Tailwind configuration, identifies animation libraries in use, and extracts the exact animations and keyframes needed to recreate the experience. It also produces screenshots for every section and component, plus additional structured metadata to make replication and iteration fast and reliable.\n\nI’m planning to open-source it and I want blunt feedback from people who would actually use it. I’m especially interested in the hard problems and real-world failure cases you hit when trying to clone or modernize production UIs, and what would make this tool genuinely indispensable.

      "text": "Hey everyone 👋,\n\nI’ve been experimenting with the new Gemini SDKs and Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) recently. Particularly Function Calling differences.  \n  \nI wanted to break down exactly how the function calling loop works under the hood and share a workflow for connecting it to a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tool Router.\n\nI figured this might be useful for anyone trying to bridge Gemini’s native tooling with MCP servers, so sharing here.\n\n\n\n**The Core Loop: How Gemini handles tools (earlier)**\n\nIf you're coming from other ecosystems, the Gemini loop is standard but strict on data structures. It essentially works like this:\n\n1. ***Declaration*****:** You pass `FunctionDeclaration` objects (*OpenAPI*\\-like schemas) in the `GenerateContentConfig`.\n2. **The Prompt:** Gemini ingests the prompt + tool schemas.\n3. **The Stop:** Instead of text, the model halts and returns a `functionCall` object in `content.parts`.\n4. **Execution (The Missing Link):** The generic SDK *doesn't* execute code for you. You have to parse the `functionCall`, execute your local code/API, and wrap the result.\n5. **The Return:** You send a new message with `role=\"tool\"` and the structured result.\n\nThe interesting part (and often the pain point) is handling the routing logic when you have dozens of tools.\n\n**Integrating an MCP Router (new flow)**\n\nWriting manual handlers for every tool gets messy fast. This is where using an MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tool Router helps abstract the execution layer.\n\nHere is a pattern for using Google ADK with an MCP Toolset. \n\n    from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent\n    from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_toolset import McpToolset\n    from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StreamableHTTPConnectionParams\n    \n    # ... (Standard Auth Setup) ...\n    \n    # 1. Create the MCP Session\n    # In this example, we use a router that aggregates search tools\n    composio_session = composio_client.experimental.tool_router.create_session(\n        user_id=COMPOSIO_USER_ID,\n        toolkits=[\"duckduckgo\", \"google_search\"] \n    )\n    \n    # 2. Connect ADK to the MCP URL\n    composio_mcp_url = composio_session.url\n    composio_toolset = McpToolset(\n        connection_params=StreamableHTTPConnectionParams(url=composio_mcp_url)\n    )\n    \n    # 3. Inject into the Agent\n    root_agent = Agent(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-pro\",\n        name=\"research_agent\",\n        # Instruction is critical for ADK to trust the tool output\n        instruction=(\n            \"You are a helpful assistant. \"\n            \"Use the available tools to answer user queries. \"\n            \"Execute the tools directly.\"\n        ),\n        tools=[composio_toolset], # <--- The MCP Toolset\n    )\n    \n\nThis example uses a router (via Composio in this instance, but the logic applies to other   \nMCP clients) to let the agent search/plan across available tools dynamically.\n\n**Why these matters?**\n\nUsing the `McpToolset` class in Google ADK allows the agent to treat the MCP server as a unified tool interface. \n\nYou don't need to manually define the schema for every single search function; the MCP handshake handles the capability discovery.\n\n  \n**Common Pitfalls**\n\nIf you are building this out, here are a few things that tripped me up:\n\n* **Schema Strictness:** Gemini is very sensitive to parameter types. If your MCP server returns a loose schema, Gemini might hallucinate arguments. Use Enums where possible.\n* **Error Propagation:** If the MCP tool fails, *return the error as a string* in the function response. Don't crash the app. Gemini can often read the error message (\"Error: 404 not found\") and self-correct or ask the user for clarification.\n* **Routing Latency:** Passing everything through a router adds a hop. For critical, low-latency tools, native function calling might still be faster than MCP.\n\nIf you want to grab the full source code for the agent setup or see a more detailed walkthrough of the environment configuration, I wrote up a guide here: [Function Calling & MCP using Google ADK](https://medium.com/composiohq/function-calling-mcp-using-google-adk-bf861421638e?postPublishedType=repub).\n\nHas anyone else here played with Google ADK's `McpToolset` yet? I'm curious how it compares to using the standard `sse`transport with other clients like Claude Desktop.\n\n",
