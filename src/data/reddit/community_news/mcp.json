Plus I've found most of the them here only.\n\nMy main criteria were minimal setup, reliability, and whether I kept using them after the novelty wore off:\n\ngreb MCP: Greb helps makes your coding agent 30% faster by helping them find correct files faster. That too without indexing It’s especially helpful for issue + commit context grounding and repo exploration. \n\nSlack / Messaging MCP: that“wow” factor with very low effort. Once an agent can talk where humans already are, teams love it instantly. My team even used this for something as basic as ordering and tracking deliveries for team lunch, which ended up being one of the most-used workflows for us.\n\nGitHub MCP: This is what finally made Claude feel like an actual teammate instead of a smarter autocomplete. If you’re tired of copy-pasting repos into prompts, you’re gonna love it. It’s especially helpful for issue + commit context grounding and repo exploration.\n\nSuper curious to hear what MCPs all of you have found useful?",

I've been using similar ones, but wanted to add one that's been a game-changer for me, and also developed by me:\n\n\"CodeGraphContext MCP\" - This one takes code understanding to another level beyond what greb offers. Instead of just file search, it builds a complete knowledge graph of your codebase with actual relationships between functions, classes, and modules.\n\nWhat makes it powerful:\n\n\\- Relationship queries: \"who calls this function?\", \"show me the class hierarchy\", \"find dead code\"\n\n\\- Cross-repo analysis: Index multiple projects + their dependencies in one graph\n\n\\- Pre-indexed bundles: Instantly load popular libraries (Flask, pandas, etc.) without re-indexing\n\n\\- Live watching: Auto-updates the graph as you code\n\n\\- Works with Neo4j or FalkorDB for visualization\n\nThe killer feature for me is being able to ask things like \"show me all functions that modify this variable\" or \"what's the call chain between X and Y\" - stuff that's impossible with just file search.\n\nIt's open source and has both a CLI and MCP server: [https://github.com/CodeGraphContext/CodeGraphContext](https://github.com/CodeGraphContext/CodeGraphContext)\n\nCurious if anyone else has tried it or has similar graph-based tools they like?",

      "text": "I’ve been building with MCP across a few integrations and the pattern is pretty consistent: getting an MCP server running is straightforward, but operating tool access safely gets hard fast once you have more than a couple servers/clients.\n\nA few things that seem to become real problems earlier than people expect:\n\n1) Secrets sprawl first.\nAs soon as credentials live on the client side (agent configs, local env vars, copied tokens), you start accumulating shared keys, inconsistent scopes, and painful rotation. It’s not just a security issue, it turns into reliability and governance overhead.\n\n2) Permissions need to be tool-level, not server-level.\nMost risk is concentrated in a small set of tools (write/delete/outbound actions). Treating an entire MCP server as a single trust boundary is too coarse. You want identity-aware capability filtering per tool, ideally per user/agent/client/environment.\n\n3) Approvals are an operational control, not a UX feature.\nIf you don’t have a clean way to pause and approve a subset of high-risk calls, teams either never expose useful write tools or accept a scary blast radius. In practice you need a stop, review, continue path that’s consistent across tools.\n\n4) Audit is what makes it a system instead of a demo.\nWhen agents touch real systems, you need to answer: who invoked what, with what parameters, what policy decision was applied, and what happened. You also need to do it without leaking sensitive data into logs.\n\n5) MCP server sprawl becomes an ops problem.\nRouting, lifecycle management, quotas/rate limits, versioning, and observability become harder to solve piecemeal per server.\n\nNet takeaway: MCP lowers the cost of connecting tools, but it raises the importance of a centralized control layer for policy, secrets, approvals, and audit across every tool call.\n\nIf you’ve run MCP in production, what did you centralize first? And what do you wish you had centralized earlier?",

          "text": "Of the five issues listed, #3 (Approvals) and #4(Audit) should primarily happen at the level of the platform consuming the MCP servers. They are not MCP-level problems. The same issues exist with any protocol used to connect from an agentic system to other business applications. And the context needed for approvals and for meaningful audit is broader in scope than any one MCP server or tool call. Of course, an MCP Gateway handling outbound MCP traffic from the agent clients can provide meaningful observability, but that's not the same as a meaningful audit.   \nIssue #2 (Permissions) -- here you raise a really interesting point. The protocol chooses to do permissions based on user identity. The latest MCP spec mandates OAuth2.1 as the auth method. This makes sense for systems with end user accounts. Since OAuth has scope definitions custom to each auth provider (eg: read\\_only, read\\_write), it can inherit the same mechanisms that have been built over the years for API permissioning. This seems sensible to me. If API keys are being used, many systems also have the ability to treat these like service accounts with scoped capabilities.  \nIf you have many clients and a few MCP servers, then issue #1 (secrets sprawl) is a problem. But not if you are using OAuth2.1 for your MCP server (no API keys being distributed anywhere). From my perspective, the MCP protocol is solving this problem via OAuth2.1 with DCR/PKCE.  \nIf you've got AI agents running automation and connecting to many MCP servers, then I'd focus on issue #5 (MCP server sprawl). In our company, [Thunk.AI](http://Thunk.AI), that's been what we centralized first. That's because we're deploying an AI automation platform in an enterprise environment. Strong requirement to have controls over whose AI agents connect to which business applications, separation of dev/test/prod environments with different keys, rate limiting, token consumption metrics tracking, etc. Our agentic automation service sends all outbound agentic traffic through an AI Gateway (we use a self-hosted instance of LiteLLM). The agentic automation service is responsible for approvals, audits, subsetting tools, overall AI agent reliability and orchestration. The AI gateway is an admin control point and responsible for protocol-level traffic management. As an aside, we see some AI gateways mixing protocol/traffic-level functionality with higher-level semantic functionality (guardrails, agents, etc) and think that's a very bad idea. But that's a whole other topic.",

The latter will get implemented as a platform service that acts as an AI gateway.   \nIt is not yet clear how tightly coupled the platform and the gateway need to be. As an analogy, in pre-AI apps, the application platform is agnostic to the API gateway and vice versa. But the API gateway tends to do very low level things that need zero application semantics. The needs of the AI gateway are still fuzzy and it might well be that it needs to be closer to the application platform.",

      "text": "When I wanted to test mcp-use (9k+ stars on GitHub), I needed a dataset spicy enough to keep me awake. Enter: 2322 Epstein emails. What followed was an afternoon of hot module reloading, CSP hell, and discovering OpenAI silently requires Plus to use custom apps.\n\n# What I needed\n\n* Basic dependencies (e.g. Node)\n* A `mcp-use` [cloud account](https://mcp-use.com/signup) to host the server (currently free)\n* ChatGPT *Plus* subscription - more on this later\n* Epstein's emails: `https://www.docetl.org/api/epstein-emails`\n\n# Setup\n\nGetting started was trivial. `npx create-mcp-use-app mcp-demo` scaffolds a demo project - I used the `mcp-apps` preset to have both OpenAI Apps SDK integration and a standard MCP server.\n\nThen, a `npm run dev` is enough to see and debug tools (both classic and UI Widgets) thanks to the inspector. This is bundled and starts automatically: a very convenient way to test.\n\n# Development\n\nDeveloping with `mcp-use` is very straightforward. The inspector (paired with HMR, aka \"hot module reload\") makes iterating VERY fast. However, I had a few minor issues with it:\n\n* The setting CSP to \"Declared\" leads to a violation even in the starter template\n* \"Hover: Disabled\" doesn't actually disable hover effects\n* Sometimes, especially when dealing with UI elements, it glitches out - a reload is usually enough\n\nThe library itself abstracts away all of the boilerplate and makes the code concise, for both tools and UI elements. You're writing only the bare minimum: title, description, schema and logic. It feels like what Stripe did for payments, but for tool definitions.\n\nThe best part is that the Model Context Protocol, being very new, hasn't crystallized yet - and you don't have to care. By using a library you're guaranteed to always be compliant and compatible - for example, I imagine Anthropic/Google creating their own variants for UI components.\n\nThe only major issue I had with the library was related to CSP (content security policy): it was not whitelisting the server's domain `fetch` requests. After a few hours of debugging I was ready to open an issue, only to find it already resolved in a development branch by a maintainer (props to Enrico). To quickly patch the issue I hardcoded the CSP `connectDomains` urls and used the PR's canary build: `npm i https://pkg.pr.new/mcp-use/mcp-use@911`. However, I'm sure that by the time you read this it will be already merged.\n\n# Deployment\n\nDeploying using `mcp-use`'s cloud offering is super straightforward: `npm run deploy` takes care of everything. It guides you through login, GitHub repo access, verifies your commits are pushed and finally shows the stream of remote build logs.\n\nIt's also nice that they provide documentation on how to self-host (and even made specific helpers) so vendor lock-in is not an issue. However, I'd still choose their version as it's tailor-made and shows interesting mcp-specific metrics (e.g. client breakdown).\n\nGiven the CSP issue I needed a \"double deploy\" to hardcode the production URL in the widgets code; build environment variables are available but they didn't work consistently for me.\n\n# Testing on ChatGPT\n\nWhen it came time to test, I happily headed to ChatGPT to add my server. It should be easy: Account -> Settings -> Apps -> Advanced Settings -> Enable Dev Mode -> Apps -> Create App.\n\n*However*, after adding the URL and everything, the app wasn't there. After way too much time I found out that the Free Plan doesn't allow you to add custom apps \\[[1](https://community.openai.com/t/chatgpt-apps-sdk-not-creating-a-custom-app-on-my-account/1369338/7), [2](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487775-apps-in-chatgpt)\\] (no warnings whatsoever). This might change in the future so before upgrading take a look.\n\n>Disclaimer: This is not the library's fault, but rather a rant against OpenAI\n\nSo, I had to buy the Plus version (luckily by signing up with a custom domain email I got a month free). While developing, make sure to hit \"refresh\" in the app's section if you make any changes.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n`mcp-use` = Rails for MCP. You write actual logic, boilerplate is handled. Few bugs, nothing blocking. *Use* it.\n\n**Try it yourself:** [https://lively-poetry-gt8c1.mcp-use.run/mcp](https://lively-poetry-gt8c1.mcp-use.run/mcp)\n",

Each developer reviewed the schema and decided what they wanted to use for their use case. You don't expect every developer to use every API call for every application.   \nAn MCP server, such as an API, can take two extreme approaches: either implement a couple of tools or allow \"code mode\". The former is similar to human developers who know what they need from the API and use only that, while the latter allows the LLM in the MCP client the freedom to call any API in any sequence.   \nMy advice is to take the middle ground and wrap a couple of the APIs as tools, based on the Pareto principle: 80% of calls will use 20% of the API. For the long tail of requests, you should enable a \"Code mode\" that provides the API schema and allows the MCP client to generate calls as needed to answer user requests.   \nThere are many security concerns for the \"Code mode\", but we some attention, you can build it safely.   \n",

A simple example is the option to delete data, or, less obviously, to update it. Once the user is authenticated, the MCP client stores the access token, and the MCP client can do everything that the user can do.   \nIf you only select the listUsers and getUser APIs (read-only) as MCP tools, there is not much risk that the MCP client will do anything else. However, if you also allow updateUser, the MCP client can now update the user record and grant them an unwarranted discount, for example. The MCP client typically doesn't display the full details of each call it makes to the MCP server, making it easy for users to miss such changes. Also, users might remember to log out of a sensitive website, but they will not remember to disconnect the MCP server from their ChatGPT. Therefore, a malicious user can use the MCP client connection to the MCP server and, through it, to the API to perform harmful actions on the data system. ",

          "text": "OP, your general understand is correct. The various comments are also spot-on. I've had to both build MCP servers and use them. There's some things to consider:  \n \\*) There's parallels between API design and MCP design. You have to choose the level of abstraction. Often an API (especially a REST API) is at the level of the entity model of the application database. Each entity has an id and that becomes one uri in the REST API with get and update methods. REST has some stylistic guidelines that steer in this direction. MCP doesn't. You can make anything you want an MCP tool. That said, many MCP servers are 1:1 wrappers over REST APIs  \n \\*) Why 1:1 -- because many of the people/companies building MCP servers are not doing it specifically for one application. And it is relatively straightforward to reflect over an OpenAPI spec and produce an MCP equivalent. This of course leads to all the concerns listed in the comments about \"code mode\" (and there's many more concerns than just what's listed)  \n \\*) One difference between MCP and REST APIs is that MCP can be stateful. For example, an MCP server over a file system can have two tools: find\\_spreadsheet and open\\_spreadsheet. If the MCP client calls open\\_spreadsheet, then the MCP server can dynamically provide tools like lookup\\_value\\_in\\_sheet. Many MCP servers don't bother and just provide stateless tools. But it is one of the powerful features of an MCP server  \n \\*) Using an LLM to chain low-level API calls is possible, but if the chaining is deterministic, you're always better off (just for reliability) to let code do the deterministic part of the work. You can put this code inside your MCP server, or it could be generated outside your MCP server (the agent could do code-gen, for example).  \n \\*) As for filtering the set of tools available, you may not need to do this at the MCP server. But most systems that consume an MCP server also have mechanisms to list the exported tools and disable some of them.   \n \\*) There are some other issues related to AI reliability if your MCP server is being used in automated agent scenarios. This article talks about some of them .. https://pravse.medium.com/the-mcp-mess-and-how-to-solve-it-7a479b31fa11.",

Claude Code handles more. Cursor has its own quirks. It's the classic \"standard\" that's more of a menu.\n\nWhat I've landed on is to design for the lowest common denominator (`tools` only), then treat everything else as progressive enhancement. If your server *requires* `resources` to function, you're going to have a bad time with half the clients out there.\n\nI couldn't agree more, it's incredibly frustrating that Anthropic wrote the spec but doesn't adhere to it! You'd expect their own products to be the reference implementation. Instead we're all reverse-engineering what actually works.\n\nHowever, MCP is still early and the ecosystem is moving fast. I'm hopeful the clients converge, but for now I'm just building defensively and testing against multiple clients before assuming anything works.\n\nWhat were you trying to use `instructions` and `resources` for?

      "text": "AI agents are getting really good at doing things, but they're completely blind to their physical surroundings.\n\nIf you walk into a hotel and you have an AI assistant (like the Chatgpt mobile app), it has no idea there may be a concierge agent on the network that could help you book a spa, check breakfast times, or request late checkout. Same thing at offices, hospitals, cruise ships. The agents are there, but there's no way to discover them.\n\nA2A (Google's agent-to-agent protocol) handles how agents talk to each other. MCP handles how agents use tools. But neither answers a basic question: how do you find agents in the first place?\n\nSo I built LAD-A2A, a simple discovery protocol. When you connect to a Wi-Fi, your agent can automatically find what's available using mDNS (like how AirDrop finds nearby devices) or a standard HTTP endpoint.\n\nThe spec is intentionally minimal. I didn't want to reinvent A2A or create another complex standard. LAD-A2A just handles discovery, then hands off to A2A for actual communication.\n\nOpen source, Apache 2.0. Includes a working Python implementation you can run to see it in action. Repo can be found at franzvill/lad.\n\nCurious what people think!",

      "text": "About 4 months ago I was working on a side project - a Telegram chat agent. I had a Telegram Bot API that I'd built a while back, running as a plain HTTP server. So what I wanted is to re-expose some of those API methods as MCP tools and give them to my agent I was working on.\n\nThe thing is, I didn't want to give the agent access to everything. Just a few specific methods, and I wanted to tune some parameters. I looked around for existing solutions and found a couple of projects that could solve my problems, but not fully. So I had an option to either write yet another MCP server and end up doing this again for my other APIs and then support all of them or build some generic solution. So this is how I ended up building my own MCP Gateway.\n\nNow, the way it works: you point it at your existing backends - existing MCP servers (over streamable HTTP), OpenAPI specs, and plain HTTP APIs - and it exposes them as a single MCP endpoint (or multiple ones if you wish). And if you’ve got an stdio-only MCP server, you can still plug it in via the Adapter.\n\nThe workflow is pretty straightforward:\n\n1. Connect your backends (MCP servers, OpenAPI specs, or HTTP APIs) as sources\n2. Create a profile and pick which tools you want to expose\n3. Profile gets you a new stable URL - that's your public MCP endpoint\n4. The UI generates a config you can paste straight into the agent / system of your choice\n5. You can now dynamically enable / disable tools, transform parameters, and do other fun stuff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/19rpzpu8cqgg1.png?width=1750&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1da42d2117cdcd447a85da58b8b6db3ed308645\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ot2vlhz9cqgg1.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=517c75935b85284928224238db8953a8e6c53c8b\n\nFor most of the things you can do it via the UI, but you can also do it directly with just configs, if you like. For example, the simplest case is when you want to re-expose your existing OpenAPI-based server, so you do it like this:\n\n    servers:\n      billing:\n        type: openapi\n        spec: https://billing.internal/openapi.json\n        baseUrl: https://billing.internal\n        autoDiscover: true\n\nEvery operation in that spec becomes an MCP tool. No SDK, no wrapper code.\n\nSo, to summarize, my MCP Gateway is like a layer in front of your servers that handles aggregation, auth, and routing. If you've used API gateways like Kong or AWS API Gateway, same idea but for MCP. Some of my friends who used it described the experience as \"ngrok for MCP with some neat features on top\".\n\nIt's written in Rust, MIT licensed, Docker-ready. There's a web UI for managing profiles, sources, and API keys, and more.\n\nYou can learn more here: [https://github.com/unrelated-ai/mcp-gateway](https://github.com/unrelated-ai/mcp-gateway)\n\nIf you have questions I'm happy to answer in the comments. Also looking for contributors if this is something that interests you.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcuhpb14cqgg1.png?width=1778&format=png&auto=webp&s=92d9b9a8c57b7482adec41be0aa9d9fd86280d30\n\n",

Currently, you can add four types of them. If you select MCP Server or Adapter on the \"Sources\" page, the UI wizard will prompt you to enter auth details for that particular upstream. You can also do the same programmatically, the UI is fully optional, but I'm referring to it as a quick way to play with the gateway.\n\nThen there's downstream-related authentication: in the first screenshot above, you can see the \"Auth\" and \"Auth Help\" buttons. This is where you can configure how auth options for your specific profile should work. You can disable it entirely, switch to using gateway-issued API keys, or use JWT/OIDC if needed. Speaking of tokens: you can issue them yourself at the tenant level (which means you can use one token to access any profile you create), or you can take a more granular approach and issue profile-level tokens. You can do it in a few clicks in the UI, so just give it a try you'll like it.\n\nThere is also a big topic around auth identity. I haven't decided exactly how it should work just yet, so as of today the work is still in progress. I'll update the community later.",

I wanted to share a project I built that makes Claude really useful for organizing messy folders.\n\n**What I built:** File Organizer MCP Server - an MCP server that lets Claude automatically organize your files into categories, find duplicates, and identify space-consuming files.\n\n**How Claude helped:**\n\n* Helped me design the security architecture (path traversal protection, symlink validation)\n* Debugged the content-based duplicate detection algorithm\n* Wrote comprehensive test coverage for the security features\n* Helped optimize the file hashing to handle large directories without memory issues\n* Refined the category system to cover 12+ file types\n\n**What it does:** When connected to Claude Desktop, you can ask Claude to:\n\n* \"Organize my Downloads folder\" - automatically sorts files into Executables, Videos, Documents, Images, Audio, etc.\n* \"Find duplicate files in my Documents\" - identifies wasted space from duplicate files\n* \"Show me the 20 largest files\" - helps you find space hogs\n* \"Categorize files in this directory\" - gives you a breakdown without moving anything\n* \"Organize with dry run\" - preview changes before executing\n\n**Technical highlights:**\n\n* Security score: 9.5/10 (multi-layer path validation, resource limits, streaming operations)\n* Handles naming conflicts automatically\n* Preserves file metadata\n* Memory-safe for large directories (tested with 10,000+ files)\n\n**Free to use:** The entire project is open source (MIT license) and free. Just install via npm and configure in Claude Desktop.\n\n**Link:** [https://github.com/kridaydave/File-Organizer-MCP](https://github.com/kridaydave/File-Organizer-MCP)\n\nI'm 15 and this is my first real open-source project, so feedback would be amazing! Claude was basically my pair programming partner throughout the entire build - especially for the security hardening parts where I didn't have prior experience.\n\nHas anyone else used MCP servers for file management workflows? Curious what other use cases people have found.\n\n*Processing video sxpwhyu751hg1...*\n\n",

Or does the Memory MCP Server have its own web interface or something like that where the end user has to add the \"memory\" them selves and then the memory is stored in a graph database or something similar?\n\nThen how is the LLM encouraged to use the Memory MCP Server?

I get the tradeoffs like HTTP/1 ubiquity, stateless infra, and simpler deployment, but I am curious how folks weigh those against streaming and long lived connections.\n\nI know HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 can be a pain in cloud environments and external facing SaaS, but for internal networks and home labs it is much easier and brings real benefits like multiplexing and true streaming. Maybe MCP is mainly targeting SaaS cloud infra, but it feels like a huge miss that there is no true streaming option for internal use cases.",

HTTP/2 (and especially HTTP/3) can unlock true multiplexing and lower‑latency streaming, but you’re right that cloud/SaaS environments often pose challenges around proxies and certs. One approach I’ve seen is experimenting with WebTransport (over HTTP/3) in a home‑lab setup to validate streaming performance, then rolling back to HTTP/2 or gRPC‑Web for external/cloud contexts.",

The idea is to keep MCP compatibility, add HTTP/2 tunneling for true streaming, and avoid multiple server implementations. I can share details if you are interested.\n\nThat is why I asked the question. Why not define an HTTP/2 option and a tunneling spec too? My guess is it would over burden the spec, and the HTTP/1 work is leaning away from streaming to keep transports compatible.

              "text": "You summarize the tension well (with a slight clarification on the streamable option available today).\n\nYou’ve touched on the fact that the MCP spec focuses on **stateless transport**. This feels like short-term gains to help massive, stateless cloud infrastructure. I agree - and that’s exactly the point of my post. They flirt with streaming but miss the opportunity; it’s a massive resource waste simply because true bidirectional streaming is difficult to deploy in large, legacy cloud infrastructure right now.  So I completely agree....\n\n... however ...\n\nAlthough MCP’s approach is \"pragmatic\" - creating an interface that *looks* like streaming - there’s no mention of how they’d ever make the jump to a real persistent transport in the future.  In fact, they're doing the opposite - removing streaming and double downing on stateless. (you touch on this too, just reiterating it for clarity)\n\nTo work around this, I use gRPC extensively already - so totally aware that streaming protocols DO exist - I'm suggesting that MCP should do that.\n\nThe downside is that it doesn’t offer an easily consumable public API for the now-popular chat protocols. However, agentic protocols like **ADK (Agent Development Kit)** or custom gRPC setups are embracing true streaming, leaving the \"popular\" MCP behind. It’s a missing scale on the dragon that I hope gets addressed.\n\n>Streamable HTTP already gives you chunked transfer encoding and progressive delivery over a single connection, which covers most of the streaming use cases.\n\nThe **Streamable HTTP** implementation (please correct me if I’m reading the code wrong) is not \"true\" streaming because the spec is still fundamentally **cursor-based**. The chunks are collected and yielded after the fact - making it \"polling with extra steps.\" This seems intentional, but I don’t see why they can’t offer a streaming option similar to how gRPC handles bidirectional streams.  It's streaming where you need to code like it's not.  Simulating non-streaming on a streaming transfer - blocking... \n\n>The 2026 roadmap is actually moving the opposite direction... toward a stateless protocol where session state lives at the app layer (cookie-style) rather than the transport.\n\nYes... instead of 2026 being the year of HTTP/3, we are scaling like it’s 2001. It works, but it’s putting **rockets on roller skates**.\n\n>The rationale is horizontal scaling. Sticky sessions and distributed state management are the bottleneck for enterprise deployments, not HTTP/1.1 limitations.\n\nI get that, and it is pragmatic. But that mainly helps Google, Amazon, and Oracle while it makes us pay more in data center costs for their ease of deployment.\n\nThe current gRPC spec in the MCP ecosystem doesn't even offer true streaming; it’s just a 1:1 mapping of the MCP JSON-RPC. Again, a miss.   \n  \nSo reeling it back to my point: **MCP is not true streaming, but should be.** I’m not arguing that \"streaming-like\" behavior doesn't exist, but MCP is literally no different than the browser polling mechanisms we’ve seen for 25 years.\n\nIf getting real streaming into the spec conflicts with the \"stateless direction\" they’re pushing, then the line in the sand should be clear: **MCP is for stateless utility; ADK and custom gRPC are for agentic streaming.**",

MCP for discovery and semantics, gRPC for the hot path when you need real streaming. Google Cloud is already shipping pluggable transports in the SDK for exactly this reason.\n\nWhere I'd push back: the June 2026 spec release is targeting stateless-first, but the Transport Working Group has multi-turn SSE as an active SEP. So it's not purely abandoning streaming... it's separating the concerns. Whether that's better or worse depends on your deployment model.",
