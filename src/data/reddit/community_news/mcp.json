If a config gets updated, the agent won't blindly trust the new version without re-verification. That way a compromised account can't silently swap in a malicious config.\n\nFor the hub itself, even something simple like showing a diff when configs change and requiring a cooldown period before new versions go live would catch most drive-by attacks. GitHub auth is a decent start, but you'd probably want contributor reputation scores based on how many configs they've submitted and how long those configs have been live without issues.\n\nThe harder problem is runtime isolation. Configs that tell an agent to interact with a banking site need to be treated differently than configs for a weather app. Some kind of permission tier system where sensitive-domain configs get extra scrutiny would go a long way.",

If my agent interacts with YouTube through the official Web MCP API, I’m trusting YouTube the same way I already trust them not to steal my cookies or leak/sell my data to malicious actors. The trust boundary is the platform itself, not some unknown contributor. That said, security is still critical. The agent communicating with an MCP server shouldn’t have access to sensitive local data in the first place. Even when talking to an official MCP endpoint, it should operate with strict scoping and least-privilege access, so no confidential information can be exposed unintentionally.",

The context blowup is exactly what pushed me to build this.\n\n\n\n  For SPAs, currently it waits on Playwright's networkidle (no network requests for 500ms) plus a 1.5s settle time for late-firing JS. Straightforward but it covers most cases.\n\n\n\n  Honestly, heavy SPAs that never stop polling or aggressive lazy-loading are a known gap right now. I have better heuristics in my internal tooling (content-length checks,\n\n  domcontentloaded fallback) that I haven't yet ported to the MCP server. That's on the roadmap for the next version.\n\n\n\n  If you hit a case where it misses async content, I'd appreciate a GitHub issue — it'll help me prioritize which patterns to handle first.",

      "text": "In the process of building Airia’s MCP Gateway, and implementing over 600 servers into it, I have had a front row seat in witnessing the evolution of the standard.  \n  \nIt's interesting to see the convergence from community-built local MCPs to remote MCPs. While most of the 700ish remote MCPs I've seen are still in the preview stage, the trend is clearly moving towards OAuth servers with a mcp.{baseurl}/mcp format. And more often than not, the newest servers require redirect-URL whitelisting, which was extremely scarce just a few months ago.\n\n\n\nThis redirect-URL whitelisting, while extremely annoying to those of us building MCP clients, is actually an amazing sign. The services implementing it are correctly understanding the security features required in this new paradigm. They've put actual thought into creating their MCP servers and are actively addressing weak points that can (and will) arise. That investment into security indicates, at least to me, that these services are in it for the long haul and won't just deprecate their server after a bad actor finds an exploit.\n\n\n\nThis new standard format is extremely helpful for the entire MCP ecosystem. With a local GitHub MCP server, you're flipping a coin and hoping the creator is actually related to the service and isn't just stealing your API keys and your data. Being able to see the base URL of an official remote server is reassuring in a way local servers never were. The explosion of thousands of local MCPs was cool; it showed the excitement and demand for the technology, but let's be honest, a lot of those were pretty sketchy. The movement from thousands of unofficial local servers to hundreds of official remote servers linked directly to the base URL of the service marks an important shift. It's a lot easier to navigate a curated harbor of hundreds of official servers than an open ocean of thousands of unvetted local ones.\n\n\n\nThe burden of maintenance also gets pushed from the end user to the actual service provider. The rare required user actions are things like updating the URL from /sse to /mcp or moving from no auth or an API key to much more secure OAuth via DCR. This moves MCP from a novelty requiring significant upfront investment to an easy, reliable, and secure connection to the services we actually use. That's the difference between a toy we play around with before forgetting and a useful tool with long-term staying power.",

It's one of those things that feels like friction when you're building a client, but it's the exact kind of friction that separates serious implementations from weekend projects.\n\nOne thing I keep running into though: even with official remote servers and proper OAuth, there's still a gap around what happens \\*between\\* the client and the servers. Like, if you're connecting to 10+ remote MCPs through a gateway, who's enforcing which tools can actually fire, tracking what each call did, and making sure a compromised server can't escalate through the gateway to reach other services?\n\nRedirect-URL whitelisting solves the front door, but the hallway between rooms is still pretty open in most setups I've seen. Curious if you've hit that in your gateway work, and how Airia handles per-server isolation.",

We can go into why next, but I thought that was general knowledge.\n\nAnyway - a streaming protocol will make handshaking easier and allow for a lot of these old school headaches to just go away.

Also worth treating the MCP server like any other dependency: pin identities, log every call (what, who, which data), and fail closed when auth or data pulls are partial.\n\nWe’re working on this at Clyra (open source here): [https://github.com/Clyra-AI](https://github.com/Clyra-AI)",

      "text": "We all run a ton of MCP servers in Cursor today. GitHub, Supabase, Stripe, Playwright... the list keeps growing because that's what makes our workflows fast and automated.\n\nThe problem is that every single server starts at launch and stays resident in memory, even when you're not using it. If you're running 10-15 servers, that's several GBs of RAM sitting there doing nothing. For anyone on a machine with limited memory, that's a real issue.\n\nSo I built **mcp-on-demand** — a proxy that sits between Cursor and your MCP servers. Instead of starting everything at launch, it starts servers only when you actually call a tool, then kills them after 5 minutes of inactivity. All your tools stay available in Cursor exactly as before, but servers only run when needed.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* **Lazy loading** — servers spawn on-demand, not at startup. All your tools remain visible in Cursor, but the actual server processes only run when called. RAM drops from GBs to \\~50 MB\n* **Auto-detection** — reads your existing `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, no manual config needed\n* **Web dashboard** — visual UI to add, remove, edit your MCP servers without touching JSON files. Opens automatically after install\n* **Auto-migration** — one command detects your servers, migrates them, and opens the dashboard\n* **Optional Tool Search mode** — for advanced users who want to reduce context token usage even further\n\n**How to install:**\n\n**Step 1** — Add mcp-on-demand to your `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"mcp-on-demand\": {\n          \"command\": \"npx\",\n          \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@soflution/mcp-on-demand\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    \n\n**Step 2** — Run one command:\n\n    npx /mcp-on-demand setup\n    \n\nThis automatically:\n\n1. Detects all your existing MCP servers\n2. Backs up your config\n3. Migrates everything into the proxy\n4. Opens the visual dashboard in your browser\n\nFrom the dashboard you can see all your servers, add new ones, edit API keys, remove what you don't need — everything visual, no JSON.\n\n**Step 3** — Restart Cursor. Done.\n\n**Who this is for:**\n\n* Cursor users running multiple MCP servers who want to keep their machine responsive\n* Anyone on 8-16 GB of RAM who needs every MB they can get\n* Anyone who wants to manage MCP servers visually instead of editing JSON files\n\nMIT licensed, zero dependencies beyond Node.js 18+.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/Soflution1/mcp-on-demand](https://github.com/Soflution1/mcp-on-demand) npm: [u/soflution/mcp-on-demand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@soflution/mcp-on-demand)\n\nHappy to answer questions or take feature requests.",

I'd be mid-workflow, the agent gets stuck because it's missing a tool, and I'd have to stop everything, go write it manually, restart, and pick up where I left off. Got annoying fast.\n\nI ended up building something to fix that for myself. The agent can now just... write the tool it needs on the spot. Mid-conversation. Saves it, uses it, and it's there permanently from that point on. Next time it needs the same thing it just calls it like it was always there.\n\nThe thing I was most paranoid about was security — letting an agent write and execute arbitrary code is sketchy if you don't think it through. So everything runs sandboxed with no access to anything sensitive unless I explicitly approve it. And I can get really specific, like \"this tool can only talk to this one domain, nothing else.\"\n\nI also added a marketplace connected to GitHub so you can publish tools and share them with others, or install tools someone else already built. Your GitHub identity handles ownership so nobody can mess with what you published.\n\nBeen using it daily for a few days now in my own projects and it's changed how I think about building agent workflows. Instead of planning tools upfront I just let the agent figure out what it needs.\n\nRepo is open if anyone wants to check it out or poke around: [https://github.com/ageborn-dev/architect-mcp-server](https://github.com/ageborn-dev/architect-mcp-server)",

      "text": "Hey all, just sharing some findings about building a handful of servers professionally. A handful may not seem like a lot (it's not) but I'll say it's because of the time spent decomposing the problem into something tangible ie. helping the customer know what they even want. That is a whole 'nother post though, happy to rant in comments anyway...  \n\n\nThis post is about my recent improvements in developing MCP servers, specifically around architecture.  \n  \nI’ve started treating an MCP server as an end product designed for an LLM to interface with, in the same way a UI is the product surface a human interfaces with. In the past, I built MCP servers by exposing a set of tools that closely mirrored the API I was wrapping. The result was “API-shaped” tooling: lots of small, low-level calls that map neatly to endpoints. Now, the LLM has to figure out the right sequence of calls, understand vendor-specific mechanics, and stitch together multiple responses into something usable. It’s a bottom-up design: start from the API and bubble up.  \n  \nA better approach is to invert this into a top-down, capability-driven design. Start from the outcomes you want the model to achieve, then design tools around those capabilities rather than around CRUD primitives. For example, consider an MCP server for Linear or Jira. Instead of API-shaped tools like get\\_issue, get\\_ticket, get\\_comments, get\\_links, or get\\_attachments, you can provide a capability tool like get\\_ticket\\_context. That tool returns the context the model actually needs in one call e.g., a short summary, recent activity, key comments, relevant links, and attachments.   \n  \nAs with most things, there’s a balance to strike between these approaches but adopting this mental model has helped me get much closer to the right place.\n\nLots of inspiration here comes from Jeremiah Lowin - creator of FastMCP!",

I went through the same evolution - started by mirroring REST endpoints 1:1, ended up with way too many tools and the model constantly picking the wrong one. Collapsing related calls into a single \"get me what I need\" tool cut my error rate in half.\n\nOne thing I'd add: putting usage examples directly in the tool description helps a lot more than a detailed JSON schema. Models respond better to \"here's how you'd call this\" than \"here are all 15 optional params.\"",

A fintech team built an internal MCP server so devs can pull support ticket context right from their IDE while debugging. Works great. But then they asked us - how do we handle auth when a dev's IDE is essentially querying production support data?  \n  \n2. An ad tech team wanted agents to retain user context across multi-tool hops. The MCP part was fine. The part where context bleeds across sessions in ways nobody intended that got messy.\n\nI keep seeing: MCP works well enough that someone puts it in a real workflow. Then the questions that come up have nothing to do with MCP itself, it's auth, it's state, it's who owns the server, it's what happens when it goes down.\n\nCurious if others are at this stage yet or still mostly local/experimental. And if you've hit the auth question specifically, how did you solve it WITHOUT ripping your existing auth system? Learning questions. \n\nAlso, if there's interest I can share a longer writeup we put together on the architectures via DM.",

          "text": "You’re seeing the real story: MCP is “easy enough” that it gets embedded, and then the hard problems show up, which are identity, authorization, and state boundaries. Treat the MCP server like any other production API surface, because in practice it is.\n\nFor the IDE-to-support-data case, the cleanest pattern I’ve seen is “on-behalf-of” auth with short-lived tokens and tight scopes, plus an authz layer that understands resource-level policy (ticket, account, tenant) and redacts by default. Don’t let the agent/IDE hold broad tokens; make it request specific actions, and log every tool call with the user identity and the exact objects touched.\n\nContext bleed is mostly a session isolation problem: explicit per-session state keys, TTLs, tenant-bound storage, and a hard rule that nothing crosses sessions unless it’s intentionally promoted (and ideally reviewed). We’re working on this at Clyra (open source here): [https://github.com/Clyra-AI](https://github.com/Clyra-AI)  \n\nAre these MCP servers mostly internal-only, or are you seeing vendors host them and ask enterprises to trust their tenancy model?",

                  "text": "yeah .....  OpenClaw ........whats the fuss?\n\nAuth and progressive discovery will be your biggest challenges.  We rolled our own code execution as a service, I am one of the engineers, but to answer your question, there are a few guidelines to consider in order for this to work at scale (im including context in that 'scale')\n\n# At a bare minimum, enterprise level integrations require:\n\n**Progressive discovery for everything**.  Even down to the individual tool or api call that can elicit large responses.   We took an agentic approach by providing enough tooling and guidance to figure it out.   In principal; it ends up being some form of list\\_api\\_servers, get\\_server\\_apis, get\\_api\\_info.  This needs to be solved at the architectural level even when selecting an off the shelf project.   We are all new at this.\n\n**Code Execution rules all**.   Purest form of agnency there is... full stop.  Anything less is a non starter.  Don't go with traditional MCP tool calling solutions.  Works great in the garage, but thats about it.  There should also be a schemaless option, this allows you to take advantage of training data at inference time, saves 100% on the API level tokens.  This has been a game changer for us.\n\n**Security/Seamless Auth** \\- meh, still a bit of work to do here but it should at least be as secure as it is today.   We allow agents to act on behalf of users so there is no redistribution of rights.   You'll need to provide seamless 3rd party service auth whether thats in browser or IDE.   The agent should browswer-use the 3rd party auth url for you, anything less kills adoption.     Our app  leverages MCP structured content widgets to show login dialogs created by the remote service.  Single click, and it can happen in flight.  This way security is sort of baked in.\n\n**Pluggability** \\- we started with the usual fab five but quickly realized why Zapier got into the game in the first place.  All you need is an openAPI spec, oAuth clientid/secret and we are off to the races, totally config driven.  Any provider should make it this easy for you to get set up.  Literally, submit a url to your or any 3rd party spec and refresh.  Tighter the spec, the better the perf.  If you box yourself in there is little to no need for code execution.  So be sure to make this a key factor in your decision making process.\n\n**Meeting you where you are** \\- Its hard enough to get enterprise wide buy in so don't make it harder on folks.   Integrate where they are.  *Firefiles or another meeting note taker agent* (trust me, there is no adoption without this.  Especially if you are a remote company)-top funnel, Slack/Teams, GSuite + plus hundreds of local libs - pymupdf, numpi, yourlocalLib ..... (not all about API's bro) these are the basics.  Then whatever else your org requires (Hubspot, Salesforce, PowerBi, Quickbooks, AutoCad, [Monday.co](http://Monday.co) ...). Eng team is a lot easier but still meeting them where they are in whatever IDE they choose (Jira, Git, Confluence, websearch yada yada).\n\nNot exactly for the faint of heart.   The promise of this level of agency requires a substantial time investment in the infrastructure, if you fail to do that you end up with OpenClaw Enterprise and that doesn't work out to well in large orgs.",
