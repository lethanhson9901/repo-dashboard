As you can see in the demo, the agent made 100+ tool calls directly to our website, which has tools exposed using WebMCP and composed a music piece with 0% error rate in tools calls, meaning it does the right thing on website instead of clicking random buttons.",

MCP support is additive because it’s a nice interface layer, not the whole product.\n\nAlso: MCP is a protocol.

The difference is how the agent discovers them:\n\nMCP: dumps every tool schema upfront (\\~185 tokens \\* 84 tools = 15,540 tokens)\nCLI: lightweight list of tool names (\\~50 tokens \\* 6 CLIs = 300 tokens). Agent runs --help only when it needs a specific tool.\n\nNumbers across different usage patterns:\n- Session start: 15,540 (MCP) vs 300 (CLI) - 98% savings\n- 1 tool call: 15,570 vs 910 - 94% savings\n- 100 tool calls: 18,540 vs 1,504 - 92% savings\n\nCompared against Anthropic's Tool Search too - it's better than raw MCP but still more expensive than CLI because it fetches full JSON Schema per tool.\n\nConverter is open source: https://github.com/thellimist/clihub\nFull write-up with detailed breakdowns: https://kanyilmaz.me/2026/02/23/cli-vs-mcp.html\n\nDisclosure: I built CLIHub.

      "text": "Google released early preview of WebMCP and it's quite interesting, it adds “AI in the browser,” and it changes how agents interact with web apps at the execution layer.\n\nRight now, browser-based agents mostly parse the DOM, inspect accessibility trees, and simulate clicks or inputs. That means reasoning over presentation layers that were designed for humans. It works, but it is layout-dependent, token-heavy and brittle when UI changes.\n\nWith WebMCP, Instead of scraping and clicking, a site can expose structured tools directly inside the browser via `navigator.modelContext`.\n\nEach tool consists of:\n\n* a name\n* a description\n* a typed input schema\n* an execution handler running in page context\n\nWhen an agent loads the page, it discovers these tools and invokes them with structured parameters. Execution happens inside the active browser session, inheriting cookies, authentication state, and same-origin constraints. There is no external JSON-RPC bridge for client-side actions and no dependency on DOM selectors.\n\nArchitecturally, this turns the browser into a capability surface with explicit contracts rather than a UI. The interaction becomes schema-defined instead of layout-defined, which lowers token overhead and increases determinism while preserving session locality.\n\n[Core Architectural Components](https://preview.redd.it/vp5ne4ehaflg1.png?width=2592&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c809cda4bf6a8fd88f982e707457a33a1c1847)\n\nSecurity boundaries are also clearer. Only declared tools are visible, inputs are validated against schemas, and execution is confined to the page’s origin. It does not eliminate prompt injection risks inside tool logic, but it significantly narrows the surface compared to DOM-level automation.\n\nThis lines up with what has already been happening on the backend through MCP servers. Open-source projects like InsForge expose database and backend operations via schema-defined MCP tools.\n\nIf backend systems expose structured tools and the browser does the same, agents can move from UI manipulation to contract-based execution across the stack. WebMCP is in early preview for now but it's very promising.\n\nI wrote down the detailed breakdown [here](https://insforge.dev/blog/webmcp-browser-native-execution-model-for-ai-agents)",

Check them out!  \nWhere mine differs is it works as a purely local solution. It provisions a secure V8 sandbox in which LLM-generated code can be run, meaning we can reduce context usage from \\`N servers x M tools\\` to 2 tools - \\`search()\\` and \\`execute()\\`.   \nThis allows the LLM to do what it's good at - writing and executing code - and thus scales the ability for us to detect and use the connected tools correctly to a few search and execute steps. It also allows us to chain requests, meaning actual tool call count also drops through the floor.  \nI've tried pretty hard to make it secure - it's written in Rust, uses V8/deno\\_core, and has been subjected to several rounds of hardening efforts - and I've written up some notes in the \\`ARCHITECTURE.md\\` file regarding considerations and best practices if you're to use it.  \nI'd love to get user feedback and be able to iterate on it more - I shipped it late last night, finessed it a bit this morning before work, and am writing this on my lunchbreak. So far, real world usage for me has seen me use it to run two high-tool count MCP servers including my other mcp project, [https://github.com/postrv/narsil-mcp](https://github.com/postrv/narsil-mcp) and a propietary security tool I've been working on (a total of 154 tools) easily and with extreme token efficiency (Cloudflare note about 99% reduction in token usage in their solution - I'm yet to benchmark mine). Theoretical upper bound for connected tools is 5000 - maybe more.   \nAnyway, check it out, let me know what you think: [https://github.com/postrv/forgemax](https://github.com/postrv/forgemax)   \nThanks!

Everything else followed naturally from there. Plus single-binary distribution matters for a local dev tool - brew install and done, no runtime deps.

      "text": "I maintain **Bifrost**, and once you go past \\~10 MCP servers, things start getting messy.\n\nFirst issue: tool name collisions. Different MCP servers expose tools with the same names. For example, a `search_files` tool from a filesystem server and another from Google Drive. The LLM sometimes picks the wrong one, and the user gets weird results.  \nWhat worked for us was simple: namespace the tools. So now it’s `filesystem.search_files` vs `gdrive.search_files`. The LLM can clearly see where each tool is coming from.\n\nThen there’s schema bloat. If you have \\~15 servers, you might end up with 80+ tools. If you dump every schema into every request, your context window explodes and token costs go up fast.  \nOur fix was tool filtering per request. We use virtual keys that decide which tools an agent can see. So each agent only gets the relevant tools instead of the full catalog.\n\nAnother pain point is the connection lifecycle. MCP servers can crash or just hang, and requests end up waiting on dead servers.  \nWe added health checks before routing. If a server fails checks, we temporarily exclude it and bring it back once it recovers.\n\nOne more thing that helped a lot once we had 3+ servers: **Code Mode**. Instead of exposing every tool schema, the LLM writes TypeScript to orchestrate tools. That alone cut token usage by 50%+ for us.\n\nIf you want to check it out:  \nCode: [https://git.new/bifrost](https://git.new/bifrost)  \nDocs: [https://getmax.im/docspage](https://getmax.im/docspage)",

The minute they are writing, everything falls apart and we’re dealing with overwriting file edits and overwritten configs. The shared state becomes the real bottleneck. It’s impossible to track which sub agents did what.\n\nSo after dealing with this I realised the issue isn’t the model quality. Like, I tried swapping out for better models inside different AI agent frameworks, but I realised I was placing the burden on the quality and it wasn’t actually tackling the real problem.\n\nIn a recent build I had I tried workspace isolation for our coding agents. The thing is that model context protocol is good at describing what MCP tools do and how to call them but it doesn’t define where those tool calls execute or the shared mutable state they operate on. Once tools mutate state the execution context is part of the problem.\n\nWhat I did was introduce a workspace layer with a small set of primitives. I made an isolated workspace and cloned it so I could compare the changes. Then I could merge the results or disregard it all. \n\nEach of the parallel agents got its own sandbox so even when they modify state it keeps the parallelism intact.\n\nSo in practice I needed to map workspaces to Git worktrees for quick branching and merging natively without custom glue code inside the agent orchestration layer.\n\nWith the isolating in place there wasn’t fragility with the parallel writing anymore and there wasn’t coordination overhead, instead the subagents could explore multiple strategies and merge the winner with the failures just thrown away instead of me tidying up this big cluster of a mess.\n\nAt this point I am wondering if anyone building stateful agent orchestration systems has done something similar or if they are tackling shared mutable state in a different way?",

Kilntainers gives every agent its own isolated, ephemeral sandbox.\n\n# Features\n\n* 🧰 **Multiple backends:** Containers (Docker, Podman), cloud-hosted micro-VMs ([Modal](https://modal.com/), [E2B](https://e2b.dev/)), and WebAssembly sandboxes (WASM BusyBox, or any WASM module).\n* 🏝️ **Isolated per agent:** Every agent gets its own dedicated sandbox — no shared state, no cross-contamination.\n* 🧹 **Ephemeral:** Sandboxes live for the duration of the MCP session, then are shut down and cleaned up automatically.\n* 🔒 **Secure by design:** The agent communicates *with* the sandbox over MCP — it doesn’t run *inside* it. No agent API keys, code, or prompts are exposed to the sandbox.\n* 🔌 **Simple MCP interface:** A single MCP tool, `sandbox_exec`, lets your agent run any Linux command.\n* 📈 **Scalable:** Scale from a few agents on your laptop to thousands running in parallel in the cloud.\n\nIt's MIT open source, and available here: [https://github.com/Kiln-AI/kilntainers](https://github.com/Kiln-AI/kilntainers)",

      "text": "I've been developing [MCPwner](https://github.com/Pigyon/MCPwner), an MCP server that lets your AI agents auto-pentest security targets. \n\nWhile most people are waiting for the latest flagship models to do the heavy lifting, I built this to orchestrate **GPT-4o** and **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** models that are older by today's standards but, when properly directed, are more than capable of finding deep architectural flaws using MCPwner.\n\nI recently pointed MCPwner at **OpenClaw**, and it successfully identified several 0-days that have now been issued official advisories. It didn't just find \"bugs\". it found critical logic bypasses and injection points that standard scanners completely missed.\n\n### The Findings:\n[Environment Variable Injection](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-82g8-464f-2mv7)\n\n\n[ACP permission auto-approval bypass](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-7jx5-9fjg-hp4m)\n\n\n[File-existence oracle info disclosure](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-6c9j-x93c-rw6j)\n\n\n[safeBins stdin-only bypass](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-4685-c5cp-vp95)\n\nThe project is still heavily in progress, but the fact that it's already pulling in multiple vulnerabilities and other CVEs I reported using mid-tier/older models shows its strength over traditional static analysis.\n\nIf you're building in the offensive AI space I’d love for you to put this through its paces. I'm actively looking for contributors to help sharpen the scanning logic and expand the toolkitPRs and feedback are more than welcome.\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/Pigyon/MCPwner](https://github.com/Pigyon/MCPwner)",
