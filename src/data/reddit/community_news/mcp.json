      "text": "[Google Chrome 145](https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/145) just shipped an experimental feature called [WebMCP](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webmcp-epp).\n\nIt's probably one of the *biggest deals* of early 2026 that's been buried in the details.\n\nWebMCP basically lets websites **register tools that AI agents can discover and call directly**, instead of taking screenshots and parsing pixels.\n\nLess tooling, more precision.\n\nAI agents tools like [agent-browser](https://jpcaparas.medium.com/give-your-coding-agent-browser-superpowers-with-agent-browser-ae3df40ff579) currently browse by rendering pages, taking screenshots, sending them to vision models, deciding what to click, and repeating. Every single interaction. 51% of web traffic is already bots doing exactly this (per Imperva's latest report).\n\nEdit: I should clarify that agent-browser doesn't need to take screenshots by default but when it has to, it will (assuming the model that's steering it has a vision LLM).\n\nHalf the internet, just... screenshotting.\n\nWebMCP flips the model. Websites declare their capabilities with structured tools that agents can invoke directly, no pixel-reading required. Same shift fintech went through when Open Banking replaced screen-scraping with APIs.\n\nThe spec's still a W3C Community Group Draft with a number of open issues, **but Chrome's backing it and it's designed for progressive enhancement.**\n\nYou can add it to existing forms *with a couple of HTML attributes.*\n\nI wrote up how it works, which browsers are racing to solve the same problem differently, and when developers should start caring.\n\n[ https://extended.reading.sh/webmcp ](https://extended.reading.sh/webmcp)",

That way a compromised account can't silently swap in a malicious config.\n\nFor the hub itself, even something simple like showing a diff when configs change and requiring a cooldown period before new versions go live would catch most drive-by attacks. GitHub auth is a decent start, but you'd probably want contributor reputation scores based on how many configs they've submitted and how long those configs have been live without issues.\n\nThe harder problem is runtime isolation. Configs that tell an agent to interact with a banking site need to be treated differently than configs for a weather app. Some kind of permission tier system where sensitive-domain configs get extra scrutiny would go a long way.",

      "text": "We launched Alai's MCP server a few weeks back and it's been crazy to see the workflows users and even our internal team have built from it. Wanted to share some of the common/useful ones that I feel could be helpful.\n\nIt connects to Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, and most other MCP clients. Setup takes a couple minutes, just grab an API key from [app.getalai.com](https://app.getalai.com/) and add the config to your client. Full docs here: [docs.getalai.com/api/mcp](https://docs.getalai.com/api/mcp)\n\nThe real power is combining it with other MCP servers. Here are some workflows we've been seeing:\n\n**Research → Deck in one conversation** Ask your agent to research a topic, refine an outline together, then say \"now create this as a presentation.\" No context switching, no copy-pasting between apps.\n\n**Internal docs → Pitch deck** Pair it with Notion MCP (or similar) to pull from your product roadmap, financials, team bios, etc. and generate a polished investor deck from all of it. One prompt, multiple sources.\n\n**Live data → Weekly reports** Connect it alongside Stripe, PostHog, or whatever analytics tools you use. \"Pull this week's metrics and make me a 5-slide marketing update\" - what used to take an afternoon now takes minutes. Save the prompt as a template and rerun it next week with fresh data. Most useful for weekly marketing/sales reviews\n\n**Meeting notes → Sales proposal** Right after a discovery call, feed your notes in and have it generate a tailored proposal deck while the conversation is still fresh. Combine with your company docs MCP to pull in standard pricing and case studies automatically.\n\nIt handles generating full decks, adding/deleting individual slides, speaker notes, and exporting to PPTX, PDF, or shareable links. You can also edit decks afterwards in Alai's editor or download the PPTX and tweak in PowerPoint.\n\nA few tips for best results: be specific about slide count, specify design/tone preferences, and iterate on the outline in conversation before generating - it's much faster than regenerating entire decks.\n\nWould love to hear what workflows others come up with or any feedback on the setup experience. Also happy to learn about existing presentation MCP experiences and what can be improved in the space.",

You will also be able to lock in templates (slide layouts) across presentations if needed.\n\nNot sure what you mean by citation links. However, you can make API requests per slide to get the transcription of that slide for auditing. If you add citation links to your raw content and ask the AI to put it on the slide in the footer then yes, that's possible as well.\n\nWould love to discuss this further and see how we can solve this end to end for you.

      "text": "I maintain Bifrost ([OSS](https://git.new/bifrost)). Working on MCP integration and the discovery problem gets messy past 10-15 servers.\n\n**The tool namespace collision:** Multiple MCP servers exposing tools with similar names. \"search\\_files\" from filesystem server vs \"search\\_files\" from Google Drive server. LLM picks the wrong one, user gets unexpected results.\n\nOur fix: namespaced tools. Each server gets a prefix - `filesystem.search_files` vs `gdrive.search_files`. LLM sees explicit tool sources, makes better decisions.\n\n**The schema bloat problem:** 50 MCP servers = 200+ tools. Dumping all tool schemas into every request blows up context windows. Token costs spike, latency increases.\n\nSolution: dynamic tool filtering. Virtual keys define which tools are available per agent/workflow. Agent only sees relevant tools, not the full catalog.\n\n**The connection lifecycle hell:** MCP servers crash, hang, or become unresponsive.

      "text": "In the process of building Airia’s MCP Gateway, and implementing over 600 servers into it, I have had a front row seat in witnessing the evolution of the standard.  \n  \nIt's interesting to see the convergence from community-built local MCPs to remote MCPs. While most of the 700ish remote MCPs I've seen are still in the preview stage, the trend is clearly moving towards OAuth servers with a mcp.{baseurl}/mcp format. And more often than not, the newest servers require redirect-URL whitelisting, which was extremely scarce just a few months ago.\n\n\n\nThis redirect-URL whitelisting, while extremely annoying to those of us building MCP clients, is actually an amazing sign. The services implementing it are correctly understanding the security features required in this new paradigm. They've put actual thought into creating their MCP servers and are actively addressing weak points that can (and will) arise. That investment into security indicates, at least to me, that these services are in it for the long haul and won't just deprecate their server after a bad actor finds an exploit.\n\n\n\nThis new standard format is extremely helpful for the entire MCP ecosystem. With a local GitHub MCP server, you're flipping a coin and hoping the creator is actually related to the service and isn't just stealing your API keys and your data. Being able to see the base URL of an official remote server is reassuring in a way local servers never were. The explosion of thousands of local MCPs was cool; it showed the excitement and demand for the technology, but let's be honest, a lot of those were pretty sketchy. The movement from thousands of unofficial local servers to hundreds of official remote servers linked directly to the base URL of the service marks an important shift. It's a lot easier to navigate a curated harbor of hundreds of official servers than an open ocean of thousands of unvetted local ones.\n\n\n\nThe burden of maintenance also gets pushed from the end user to the actual service provider. The rare required user actions are things like updating the URL from /sse to /mcp or moving from no auth or an API key to much more secure OAuth via DCR. This moves MCP from a novelty requiring significant upfront investment to an easy, reliable, and secure connection to the services we actually use. That's the difference between a toy we play around with before forgetting and a useful tool with long-term staying power.",

      "text": "I was frustrated with Playwright MCP being slow and getting blocked on many sites, so I built CamoFox MCP - an MCP server that wraps the CamoFox anti-detection browser (based on Camoufox/Firefox).\n\nWhat it does:\n\n* 22 MCP tools for full browser automation (navigate, click, type, snapshot, screenshot, search across 14 engines, etc.)\n* Anti-detection fingerprinting - each tab gets a unique fingerprint so sites don't flag you as a bot\n* Session isolation per user with cookie import/export\n* Works with Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot, Cursor, or any MCP client\n\nWhy I built it: Playwright MCP kept getting blocked by Cloudflare, bot detection, and CAPTCHAs. CamoFox uses Camoufox (a patched Firefox fork) that passes most anti-bot checks. The MCP server is a thin TypeScript wrapper over CamoFox's REST API.\n\nQuick start: npx -y camofox-mcp@latest\n\n(Requires CamoFox browser running on localhost:9377)\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/redf0x1/camofox-mcp](https://github.com/redf0x1/camofox-mcp) npm: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/camofox-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/camofox-mcp)\n\nWould love feedback from the community. MIT licensed, contributions welcome!\n\n========  \nv1.5.5 just dropped — here's what's new:\n\n🔧 32 MCP tools (up from 22) — added batch operations (fill\\_form, batch\\_click, type\\_and\\_submit), composite tools (navigate\\_and\\_snapshot, scroll\\_and\\_snapshot), and full profile persistence (save\\_profile, load\\_profile, list\\_profiles, delete\\_profile)\n\n🌍 Geo preset API — request region-specific fingerprints per session via list\\_presets + create\\_tab(preset=\"japan\"). Locale, timezone, geolocation, and viewport all configurable.\n\n🔒 Auto session persistence — sessions now auto-save on close and auto-restore on create\\_tab. No more manual cookie juggling between runs.\n\nnpm install: npx -y camofox-mcp@latest\n\nDocker + Kubernetes support coming in v1.6.0. Feedback welcome!",

Did you consider exposing CamoFox directly as an MCP server without the intermediate layer? Asking because I've been wrestling with similar tradeoffs when wrapping browser automation for agent workflows.\n\nOne thing that would make this even more useful: persistent session profiles. Right now I'm guessing you'd need to manually export/import cookies between runs. Having named profiles that auto-persist fingerprint + cookies would be huge for workflows that need to maintain state across multiple agent sessions.\n\nWhat's the memory footprint like when running 5-10 concurrent tabs with unique fingerprints?",

Solid for when you just want to keep a regular eye on stats and not wait for weekly reviews. I just ask Claude things like \"is our new blog getting any traction\" or \"which landing pages had the highest bounce rate last week.\" I get the answer in seconds. \n\n**Notion MCP (Knowledge base)** If your team lives in Notion like mine does, this is a game-changer. I majorly use this with other MCPs - for example it uses by GA4 data to create our weekly reviews on Notion, I also use it to get a better first draft for product marketing assets since it pulls all info from our Notion repository\n\n**Alai MCP (Presentations)**: Our current sales process involves creating custom decks for each client. Earlier the hassle of pulling info from Notion (we also currently use Notion as a temp CRM) + slack threads + call recordings was such a huge pain. Now I've created a baseline template - I use that + MCPs for all these tools to create the content on claude and then use the Alai MCP to get the deck ready using my brand template within 10-15 mins - such a time saver considering how I end up making 10-15 PPTs a week\n\n**Ahrefs MCP (SEO & competitive research)** If you do any SEO or content strategy work, this one's incredibly useful. Being able to ask Claude things like \"what first-page rankings does \\[competitor\\] have that we don't\" or \"show me our top declining keywords this month\" without opening dashboards and running reports manually -  it just removes so much friction from the research phase. I use it most when planning new content or auditing existing pages. Pairs well with Notion MCP for dropping findings straight into our content calendar.\n\n  \nI'm looking for more MCPs to optimize my workflow - if I am missing on any major ones pls do share and I hope the marketers out there find this useful :)",

      "text": "We all run a ton of MCP servers in Cursor today. GitHub, Supabase, Stripe, Playwright... the list keeps growing because that's what makes our workflows fast and automated.\n\nThe problem is that every single server starts at launch and stays resident in memory, even when you're not using it. If you're running 10-15 servers, that's several GBs of RAM sitting there doing nothing. For anyone on a machine with limited memory, that's a real issue.\n\nSo I built **mcp-on-demand** — a proxy that sits between Cursor and your MCP servers. Instead of starting everything at launch, it starts servers only when you actually call a tool, then kills them after 5 minutes of inactivity. All your tools stay available in Cursor exactly as before, but servers only run when needed.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* **Lazy loading** — servers spawn on-demand, not at startup. All your tools remain visible in Cursor, but the actual server processes only run when called. RAM drops from GBs to \\~50 MB\n* **Auto-detection** — reads your existing `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, no manual config needed\n* **Web dashboard** — visual UI to add, remove, edit your MCP servers without touching JSON files. Opens automatically after install\n* **Auto-migration** — one command detects your servers, migrates them, and opens the dashboard\n* **Optional Tool Search mode** — for advanced users who want to reduce context token usage even further\n\n**How to install:**\n\n**Step 1** — Add mcp-on-demand to your `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"mcp-on-demand\": {\n          \"command\": \"npx\",\n          \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@soflution/mcp-on-demand\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    \n\n**Step 2** — Run one command:\n\n    npx /mcp-on-demand setup\n    \n\nThis automatically:\n\n1. Detects all your existing MCP servers\n2. Backs up your config\n3. Migrates everything into the proxy\n4. Opens the visual dashboard in your browser\n\nFrom the dashboard you can see all your servers, add new ones, edit API keys, remove what you don't need — everything visual, no JSON.\n\n**Step 3** — Restart Cursor. Done.\n\n**Who this is for:**\n\n* Cursor users running multiple MCP servers who want to keep their machine responsive\n* Anyone on 8-16 GB of RAM who needs every MB they can get\n* Anyone who wants to manage MCP servers visually instead of editing JSON files\n\nMIT licensed, zero dependencies beyond Node.js 18+.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/Soflution1/mcp-on-demand](https://github.com/Soflution1/mcp-on-demand) npm: [u/soflution/mcp-on-demand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@soflution/mcp-on-demand)\n\nHappy to answer questions or take feature requests.",

Started with personal stuff, but the real problem hit when I started working with a team.\n\nEvery Claude Code session is an island. Someone spends an hour debugging an auth issue, fixes it, session ends. A few days later another dev hits the same thing. Starts from zero. One dev fixes auth one way. Another dev doesn't know, changes it. Someone re-explains the same thing to Claude that they already covered two hours ago.\n\nThe knowledge exists. It's just trapped in sessions nobody else can access.\n\nSo we built Recall - a platform that makes Claude Code actually work for teams.\n\n* **Sessions are automatically captured and encrypted when they end**\n* **When any dev starts a new session, their Claude already has context from the whole team**\n* **Search across every session your team has ever run**\n* **Dashboard showing what your team is actually building**\n* **End-to-end encrypted, no source code stored, raw transcripts deleted immediately**\n\nNot just for devs either. A PM can connect through Claude Desktop and ask \"what's blocking the auth migration?\" without bothering anyone.\n\nLaunched today.

It is how context and actions from external systems are made available to an LLM.  \n\\*) Agents are really a for-loop-wrapper on top of an LLM, providing a set of tools, and making tool calls when requested by the LLM. From the \"outside\", a single call to the OpenAI (or equivalent) API may do this agentic loop on the \"inside\"  \n\\*) Instead of everyone building one-off protocols for tool calling, MCP is a standard protocol. It is a syntactic protocol not a semantic one. So you can wrap some service in an MCP server and publish it. Then any AI client can choose to use it  \n\\*) \"Use it\" means both inspect it (list tools, their descriptions, parameters) which is essential for an AI agent to decide to invoke it, and actually invoke it (run a tool, using a standardized format).  \n\\*) As a practical matter, this is way better than everything having its own one-off REST API because someone who have hand-build a tool to invoke it. If you have exactly one API to call and that's it, maybe that is all  \n\\*) This has nothing to do with context windows --- tiny context window or massive context window, MCP helps standardize tool calling (discovery and actual tool invocation)\n\nSo that's the \"basic\" MCP -- and you could say, ok functionally it is the same as REST APIs, but with a standardized syntax. And in a growing number of cases, the underlying SaaS service itself hosts the MCP server (eg: Notion hosts one, Intercom hosts one, Salesforce has one in preview, etc). So it shifts the burden of integration away from the consumer and to the source.  \n  \nBut things have moved beyond that ..\n\n\\*) MCP also exposes resources  \n\\*) MCP is stateful -- this is super important. Calling one tool can cause other tools to become available  \n\\*) MCP tool calls can be long running. So workflows and sub-agents can be exposed as MCP.  \n\\*) MCP tools can return UI (in a standard form that AI clients will respect)\n\nFInally, as I noted, there is the MCP syntax and then there is the question of semantics. REST APIs tend to be low-level developer-facing interfaces. If you want agents to do well, you want MCP tools that are higher-level semantic interfaces (sort of like the buttons you'd put in an app in front of a human being). Often these might compose many lower-level API calls.  \n  \nSo I'd say syntactically, you can expose a REST API via 1:1 mapping to MCP (and that's what most MCP servers do today). That gives you some benefit with simpler integration to your AI client. But then if you use it with its richer semantics, you get very much better outcomes",

I'd be mid-workflow, the agent gets stuck because it's missing a tool, and I'd have to stop everything, go write it manually, restart, and pick up where I left off. Got annoying fast.\n\nI ended up building something to fix that for myself. The agent can now just... write the tool it needs on the spot. Mid-conversation. Saves it, uses it, and it's there permanently from that point on. Next time it needs the same thing it just calls it like it was always there.\n\nThe thing I was most paranoid about was security — letting an agent write and execute arbitrary code is sketchy if you don't think it through. So everything runs sandboxed with no access to anything sensitive unless I explicitly approve it. And I can get really specific, like \"this tool can only talk to this one domain, nothing else.\"\n\nI also added a marketplace connected to GitHub so you can publish tools and share them with others, or install tools someone else already built. Your GitHub identity handles ownership so nobody can mess with what you published.\n\nBeen using it daily for a few days now in my own projects and it's changed how I think about building agent workflows. Instead of planning tools upfront I just let the agent figure out what it needs.\n\nRepo is open if anyone wants to check it out or poke around: [https://github.com/ageborn-dev/architect-mcp-server](https://github.com/ageborn-dev/architect-mcp-server)",
