So where we could dream up ways to progressively disclose details, it comes down to whether clients adopt it. \n\nIn 3.0 we're experimenting with skills-over-MCP which has been pretty fun.",

They don't know (and don't want to learn) what tool should be called for each node/prompt/workflow. They want to write down a generic prompt and magically see their workflow being built and working. For instance, they want to build executive presentations using internal data from their CRM, ERP and commerce platform with a single generic prompt. We needed governance and control, and a smart tool selection.\n\n* Did it actually improve control, security, or observability for agent/tool usage?\n\nYes. Access/permission management + observabilitiy (latency, error rate, log)\n\n* What surprised you after deploying it (good or bad)?\n\nGood: Cost control, how much each user/team/group/tag is spending  \nBad: UX.  We tried one single UI  for both devs and non-devs, but now we are investing in a more general business-oriented UX, with a \"developer mode\" that add some features and details, non-technical people are simply not interested in the technical details.\n\n* What’s still missing or harder than it should be?\n\n\\-Not so much about the MCP gateway, but for the internal AI Platform:   \n\\- Easier way to create Whatsapp workflows  \n\\- Auto-RAG when big/multiple files are added, and they are larger than the context window",

      "text": "Got a few questions in my dms after yesterday's post about Code Mode, so writing up the actual MCP setup process since the folks asked how to get started.\n\n**Basic connection is pretty simple:**\n\nConnect to any MCP server via STDIO, HTTP, or SSE. For local tools like filesystem stuff, STDIO works fine. Remote services use HTTP.\n\n`{ \"mcp\": { \"client_configs\": [{ \"name\": \"filesystem\", \"connection_type\": \"stdio\", \"stdio_config\": { \"command\": \"npx\", \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@anthropic/mcp-filesystem\"] } }] } }`\n\n**Important security detail:**\n\nTool calls from the LLM are just suggestions by default. Nothing actually executes unless you explicitly call the execution endpoint. This caught me off guard initially but it's the right design - prevents accidental API calls or data modifications.\n\nIf you want autonomous execution, enable Agent Mode and specify which tools can auto-execute via `tools_to_auto_execute`.\n\n**Code Mode setup (from yesterday):**\n\nSet `is_code_mode_client: true` on your MCP clients. LLM writes TypeScript to orchestrate tools instead of the standard iterative approach. Cuts tokens significantly when you have multiple servers.\n\n**Tool filtering:**\n\nControl which tools are available per request or per virtual key. Useful for different environments or team permissions.\n\nBifrost can also act as an MCP server - expose your tools to Claude Desktop or other MCP clients through the gateway URL.\n\nSetup docs: [https://docs.getbifrost.ai/features/mcp](https://docs.getbifrost.ai/features/mcp)  \nGithub: [https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost)\n\nAnyone run into issues setting this up?",

Composio, Lunar.dev, and a few others have one-click deployment with OAuth baked in.\n\nFastMCP Cloud (mentioned in the comments) works well for simpler setups.

Burned through 10% of the context window for a single search.\n* [Exa.ai](http://Exa.ai), [context7.com](http://context7.com), Brave Search MCP: I'm strongly turned off by the pay-per-thousand model or caps on free plans. I understand they have to make money, it's just not what I want to spend money on.\n* [https://github.com/arabold/docs-mcp-server:](https://github.com/arabold/docs-mcp-server:) I didn't test this, but I was turned off by the fact you have to run the server in the background instead of allowing it to be booted by the Codex instance (via npx) like it can for other kinds of MCP servers.\n\nDoes anyone have a solution to this that hits on all marks: free, able to read websites including JS ones, thorough and high-quality?",

It’s basically a standard way to expose tools to an agent without bloating context or writing custom glue for every service. For example, when an agent needs live web data, instead of hardcoding scrapers or APIs, you can put a web-access layer behind MCP. That’s where setups like Bright Data’s [MCP server](https://github.com/brightdata/brightdata-mcp) come in: the agent calls search/browse/extract tools on demand, and the infrastructure handles access and blocking. If your agent only works on local code or static docs, MCP adds little value.",

Depending on the task and which cli Im running at the time I just have it use the board or vault to store long term or project logs. Then, if I switch to Gemini, or codex (Claude code is my main driver) I just have them review the board or value (per project or long term) for whatever context they need and they can pick up form there. \n\nI can share a spec later, as I don't remember exactly if the pub/sub uses postgres or something else (I have 157 specialized agents). \n\nI also have a \"deliberator\" where I can have Claude discuss a task with codex and Gemini cli before it makes a decision. Or it gets back to me with what they decided and I approve or ask them to discuss again based on the new info. \n\nThe easiest thing, if you have Claude code cli, would be to ask Claude to create an Mcp for you. It has Mcp builder built in and will do a pretty good job. As long as you tell it what you need.",

Attention is computed as softmax(QK\\^T/√d\\_k)V - the Q from your current forward pass is computing dot products against cached K vectors. If those K vectors came from a different model's projection matrices, you're computing similarity in incompatible latent spaces. The attention scores are meaningless.\n\nBeyond that: different tokenizers (e.g., Claude's BPE vs Gemini's SentencePiece), different vocabulary mappings, different embedding dimensions, different positional encoding schemes. Token 4521 doesn't reference the same subword, and even if it did, the embedding vector lives in a completely different learned manifold.\n\nThere is no harness that reconciles incompatible learned representations. The \"harness solution\" (serialize text, re-tokenize, re-embed in target model's native space) exists precisely BECAUSE architectural constraints make true state sharing impossible.\n\nDismissing this as \"not an architecture question\" demonstrates a fundamental confusion about what the harness layer is abstracting over and why.\n\nedit: realizing you didn't actually read my whole response, or OPs response to it...  wrote this before i realized that.",
