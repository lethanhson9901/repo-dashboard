The reason why I did this is because for a free user local llms are not so efficient in tool use as most machines can only host smaller models. OpenRouter as well gives strict limits for free tier but its good with moderate tool calls and context length.\n5. Although you can configure individuals ones as well.

Works with any LLM (local or remote).\n\n  ## New in v2.5.0: Universal Format Support\n\n  - ✅ **Generic Markdown export** - works with ANY LLM\n  - ✅ **Claude AI** format (if you use Claude)\n  - ✅ **Google Gemini** format (with grounding)\n  - ✅ **OpenAI ChatGPT** format (with vector search)\n\n  ## Why This Matters for Local LLMs\n\n  Instead of context-dumping entire docs, you get:\n  - **Organized structure**: Categorized by topic (getting-started, API, examples, etc.)\n  - **Extracted patterns**: Code examples pulled from docs with syntax highlighting\n  - **Portable format**: Pure markdown ZIP - use with Ollama, llama.cpp, or any local model\n  - **Reusable**: Build once, use with any LLM\n\n  ## Quick Example\n\n  ```bash\n  # Install\n  pip install skill-seekers\n\n  # Scrape any documentation\n  skill-seekers scrape --config configs/react.json\n\n  # Export as universal markdown\n  skill-seekers package output/react/ --target markdown\n\n  # Result: react-markdown.zip with organized .md files\n```\n\n  The output is just structured markdown files - perfect for feeding to local models or adding to your RAG pipeline.\n\n  Features\n\n  - 📄 Documentation scraping with smart categorization\n  - 🐙 GitHub repository analysis\n  - 📕 PDF extraction (for PDF-based docs)\n  - 🔀 Multi-source unified (docs + code + PDFs in one skill)\n  - 🎯 24 preset configs (React, Vue, Django, Godot, etc.)\n\n  Links\n\n  - GitHub: https://github.com/yusufkaraaslan/Skill_Seekers\n  - PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/skill-seekers/\n  - Release: https://github.com/yusufkaraaslan/Skill_Seekers/releases/tag/v2.5.0\n\n  MIT licensed, contributions welcome!

You have to be very careful at times and build safe guards into your tools. For example in my mcp server I had a read\\_file tool. simple except for the fact it read a file much larger than it should have, the context immediately jumped to 800k tokens and the chat was unrecoverable.\n\nfrom there i started to build in hard coded limits like limiting the max lines readable to 500 for read\\_file. Then when we build composite tools, we can think of different ways to do them. My favorite is enum menus where tools can be more modular and one tool can serve many different functions.\n\nThen we can also add in batch tools.  \nbatch\\_read\\_files  \nbatch\\_string\\_replace  \nbatch\\_read\\_lines  \netc\n\nthis allow us to turn 20 calls into 1. A time saver and a context saver for the misc info we get from tool outputs.",

      "text": "Been using Claude with Microsoft 365 via MCP and hit two frustrations:\n\n**Problem 1: Context bloat**\n\nThe popular MS Graph MCPs expose 30-40 specialized tools like `list-mail-messages`, `create-calendar-event`, `get-user`, etc. That's ~12KB of context eaten up before you even start talking. Claude already knows the Graph API - it doesn't need 37 hand-holding tools.\n\n**Problem 2: Multi-tenant switching sucks**\n\nI manage multiple M365 tenants (work, clients, personal). Every time I wanted to query a different tenant, I had to call `select-account`, wait, then make my request. Constantly switching context.\n\n**The fix:**\n\nForked the Softeria MCP and stripped it down to 7 tools:\n- `login`, `logout`, `verify-login` (auth)\n- `list-accounts`, `select-account`, `remove-account` (account management)\n- `graph-request` (one tool for ALL Graph API calls)\n\nThe `graph-request` tool takes an `accountId` parameter, so you can query any tenant directly without switching:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"endpoint\": \"/me/messages\",\n  \"accountId\": \"client-tenant-abc123\"\n}\n```\n\nQuery work and personal calendars in the same conversation. No switching dance.\n\n~1KB context instead of ~12KB. Same capabilities.\n\n**Repo:** https://github.com/ForITLLC/forit-microsoft-graph\n\nMIT licensed, fork of Softeria's work. Just a different philosophy - less is more.\n\nAnyone else running into context bloat issues with MCPs?\n",

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nKept looking for a **deep research** workflow that acts like a good analyst team aka : gather sources, generate hypotheses, challenges/critiques, and stitch a crisp answer. \n\nMost DR products (or modes) end up with 1-shot DR.   \n  \nNot to forget :   \n(a) single model hallucinations (made up links anyone?)  \nor   \n(b) a pile of unstructured notes with lil accountability\n\nI often keep running the output copy pasting from one model to another to validate the hypothesis and synthesis. \n\nthe current work is inspired a ton by Karpathy’s work on the LLM-council repo - over the holidays, built **Counsel MCP Server**: an MCP server that runs **structured debates** across a **family of LLM agents** to **research + synthesize** with fewer silent errors. The council emphasizes: a debuggable artifact trail and a MCP integration surface that can be plugged in into any assistant.\n\nIf you want to try it, there’s a **playground assistant** with Counsel MCP already wired up: [**https://counsel.getmason.io**](https://counsel.getmason.io/)\n\n# What it does ?\n\n* You submit a research question or task.\n* The server runs a structured loop with multiple LLM agents (examples: propose, critique, synthesize, optional judge).\n* You get back artifacts that make it inspectable:\n   * **final** synthesis (answer or plan)\n   * **critiques** (what got challenged and why)\n   * **decision record** (assumptions, key risks, what changed)\n   * **trace** (run timeline, optional per-agent messages, cost/latency)\n\nThis is not just \"N models voting.” in a round robin pattern - the council will do structured arguments and critique aimed at better research outcomes.\n\n# Have 3 top of mind questions - any feedback here would be great?\n\n1. What’s a useful API variant here ?\n   * A single `counsel.research()` or `counsel.debate()` tool plus resources?\n   * Or multiple tools (run, stream, explain, get)?\n2. What’s the right pattern for research runs that take 10–60 seconds?\n   * streaming events\n   * polling resources\n   * returning everything inline\n3. What should the final artifact contain?\n   * final output only\n   * final + critiques\n   * full trace + decision record\n   * what’s the minimum that still makes this debuggable and trustworthy?\n\nGive it a spin & tell me what gives\n\nPlayground: [**https://counsel.getmason.io**](https://counsel.getmason.io/)\n\nIf you try it, I’d love to hear any feedback good, blahhhh, meh?",

          "text": "Got asked this in a comment   \n=======================  \nReally interesting setup with the research council workflow! The \"debuggable artifact trail\" requirement resonated. Interestingly, we're seeing this a lot as critical for multi-agent MCP systems.  \n  \nHow are you currently validating that the debate structure produces reliable results, and what's been your approach to debugging when the council output is unexpected?\n\n  \nthought of throwing in some views in here  \n===================================  \n  \nOur approach has 3 layers:\n\n\\#1 - Validation: Strict JSON schemas per phase, mandatory evidence citations (no unsourced claims), and a locked Crux Registry after the Attack phase to prevent semantic drift. We validate at the structure level (schema compliant) and semantic level (crux stability, agreement thresholds per tension).\n\n\\#2 - Debugging: Every debate produces an append-only artifact trail - transcripts per role/round, the exact context each role saw (including argument shuffle order), schema repair attempts, and crux evolution. When output is out of bounds (unexpected), we trace back through - which role drove the conclusion   \n→ what evidence was cited   \n→ whether the crux positions shifted unexpectedly   \n→ whether validation repair led to loss in nuance.\n\n\\#3 - We also support human-in-the-loop intervention (pause, steer, modify\\_tensions) for real-time course correction when you see the debate heading somewhere wrong. the \"debuggable artifact trail\" you talk abt is what this is optimized for - a multi-agent debate synthesis is only trustworthy if you can audit the reasoning chain.",

It also produces screenshots for every section and component, plus additional structured metadata to make replication and iteration fast and reliable.\n\nI’m planning to open-source it and I want blunt feedback from people who would actually use it. I’m especially interested in the hard problems and real-world failure cases you hit when trying to clone or modernize production UIs, and what would make this tool genuinely indispensable.
