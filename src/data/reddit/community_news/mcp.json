Plus I've found most of the them here only.\n\nMy main criteria were minimal setup, reliability, and whether I kept using them after the novelty wore off:\n\ngreb MCP: Greb helps makes your coding agent 30% faster by helping them find correct files faster. That too without indexing It’s especially helpful for issue + commit context grounding and repo exploration. \n\nSlack / Messaging MCP: that“wow” factor with very low effort. Once an agent can talk where humans already are, teams love it instantly. My team even used this for something as basic as ordering and tracking deliveries for team lunch, which ended up being one of the most-used workflows for us.\n\nGitHub MCP: This is what finally made Claude feel like an actual teammate instead of a smarter autocomplete. If you’re tired of copy-pasting repos into prompts, you’re gonna love it. It’s especially helpful for issue + commit context grounding and repo exploration.\n\nSuper curious to hear what MCPs all of you have found useful?",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nAnyone else tired of configuring 50 tools into MCP and just hoping the agent figures it out? (invoking the right tools in the right order).\n\nWe keep hitting same problems:\n\n* Agent calls \\`checkout()\\` before \\`add\\_to\\_cart()\\`\n* Context bloat: 50+ tools served for every conversation message.\n* Semantic loss: Agent does not know which tools are relevant for the current interaction\n* Adding a system prompt describing the order of tool invocation and praying that the agent follows it.\n\nSo I wrote Concierge. It converts your MCP into a stateful graph, where you can organize tools into stages and workflows, and agents only have tools **visible to the current stage**.\n\n    from concierge import Concierge\n    \n    app = Concierge(\"my-server\")\n    \n    \n    app.stages = {\n        \"browse\": [\"search_products\"],\n        \"cart\": [\"add_to_cart\"],\n        \"checkout\": [\"pay\"]\n    }\n    \n    \n    app.transitions = {\n        \"browse\": [\"cart\"],\n        \"cart\": [\"checkout\"]\n    }\n\nThis also supports sharded distributed state and semantic search for thousands of tools. (also compatible with existing MCPs)\n\nDo try it out and love to know what you think. Thanks!\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/concierge-hq/concierge](https://github.com/concierge-hq/concierge)\n\nInstall it with: `pip install concierge-sdk`",

It overcomes the limitations of text-based interactions by delivering rich, sandboxed UI experiences right inside conversations, while keeping the model involved through seamless bidirectional communication.\n\nBefore this, we had OpenAI's Apps SDK, a proprietary alternative that allowed similar functionality but was limited to the ChatGPT sandbox, with exclusive runtime variables and APIs. In contrast, MCP Apps enables UI rendering in *any* MCP client that supports it, promoting a more open and portable ecosystem.\n\n# GPT Apps vs. MCP Apps\n\n* **Backbone**: GPT Apps build on MCP plus OpenAI's proprietary widget runtime, while MCP Apps use pure MCP with a standardized UI extension.\n* **UI Declaration**: GPT Apps declare UIs via `_meta.openai/outputTemplate` or similar, whereas MCP Apps use the standard `_meta.ui.resourceUri: \"ui://dashboard\"`.\n* **UI Delivery**: Both deliver bundled HTML/JS resources served by an MCP server.\n* **Host and UI**: GPT Apps rely on OpenAI-specific widget runtime and postMessage, but MCP Apps standardize it with JSON-RPC over postMessage.\n\nThe ecosystem has converged remarkably fast. MCP Apps emerges as the open, multi-platform winner going forward and with ChatGPT now supporting the official standard, you no longer have to choose between them.

Same thing at offices, hospitals, cruise ships. The agents are there, but there's no way to discover them.\n\nA2A (Google's agent-to-agent protocol) handles how agents talk to each other. MCP handles how agents use tools. But neither answers a basic question: how do you find agents in the first place?\n\nSo I built LAD-A2A, a simple discovery protocol. When you connect to a Wi-Fi, your agent can automatically find what's available using mDNS (like how AirDrop finds nearby devices) or a standard HTTP endpoint.\n\nThe spec is intentionally minimal. I didn't want to reinvent A2A or create another complex standard. LAD-A2A just handles discovery, then hands off to A2A for actual communication.\n\nOpen source, Apache 2.0. Includes a working Python implementation you can run to see it in action. Repo can be found at franzvill/lad.\n\nCurious what people think!",

The former is similar to human developers who know what they need from the API and use only that, while the latter allows the LLM in the MCP client the freedom to call any API in any sequence.   \nMy advice is to take the middle ground and wrap a couple of the APIs as tools, based on the Pareto principle: 80% of calls will use 20% of the API. For the long tail of requests, you should enable a \"Code mode\" that provides the API schema and allows the MCP client to generate calls as needed to answer user requests.   \nThere are many security concerns for the \"Code mode\", but we some attention, you can build it safely.   \n",

However, if you also allow updateUser, the MCP client can now update the user record and grant them an unwarranted discount, for example. The MCP client typically doesn't display the full details of each call it makes to the MCP server, making it easy for users to miss such changes. Also, users might remember to log out of a sensitive website, but they will not remember to disconnect the MCP server from their ChatGPT.

          "text": "This is still not right. \n\nIt was never right and it isn’t right now.\n\nThink about it. How does MCP work? look at the interaction diagram on the modelcontextprotocol.io website. \n\nAn agent or tool uses MCP to talk to a server to \n- ask which tools are available \n- learn about the purpose of each of the tools and how to invoke (required params and expected responses)\n- invoke tools and get responses. \n\nAn agent.  Read that again. An agent uses MCP.  What uses MCP to talk to a server ?  An AGENT.\nDoes the agent use MCP to talk to the model? No. It does not. Check the diagram on the MCP website. \n\nOk at startup the agent calls each MCP server… using the MCP protocol….  and says “tell me which tools you have available”.  And the MCP server …. Using the MCP protocol…. Returns the list of tools available, back to the agent. \n\nThen, _after the agent gets the list of tools available from the MCP server (or maybe multiple)_, the agent sends to the LLM a user query along with a list of tools available. This list of tools is a transformation of the list retrieved from the servers. It is not jsonrpc , it is not MCP (the protocol). It is json.  \n\nLet me repeat that because it’s important: The agent does not use MCP to communicate with the LLM (aka model).  The model does not know about MCP. The model does not know where the tools came from.  \n\nThere is no universe in which the model will find it “easier” to use a tool that was originally propagated to the agent via MCP, as compared to a tool that was originally propagated to the agent via API. IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. \n\n\nPeople who say “it’s easier for a model to use tools exposed via MCP” … either do not understand, or want to fool you. \n\n2nd thing - there is a bit of truth to the idea that IN THEORY, MCP allows progressive expansion of the list of tools.  \n\nIn theory. \n\nAnd in actuality, there are approximately zero concrete implementations of MCP servers that expose different sets of tools at different times to the same agent. I have seen MCP servers that expose different sets of tools to different agents, depending on the user or agent identity. But not different over time for the same identities. \n\nSo it is true that MCP, the protocol, allows for this progressive exposure of tools.  And it is also true that there’s no practical way to implement it. The MCP server does not have the context that the agent has.  The MCP server knows only that an agent (MCP client) has or has not invoked a tool. This information is not enough to produce a high quality “progressive” expansion of the list of tools. \n\nImagine an MCP server: “Oh you invoked tool A? I will now tell you about tool B!”  That’s possible but that kind of interaction will starve agents of reasoning capability. The agent solves problems with the model by assembling a plan for invoking multiple tools to arrive at a solution. If the MCP server doesn’t tell the agent about all the tools, a priori, then the agent+model cannot reason through a solution. \n\nAnd why do we want this progressive release of tools anyway? What is the benefit?  As I understand, The issue is that multiple MCP servers with multiple tools each can incur a token tax. Just telling the model about the tools can consume lots of tokens. Imagining that a progressive exposure of tools will reduce on that token tax… is a fantasy. That’s not what is happening in practice. \n\nIn short. This opinion is not useful. It confuses or misleads people.",

An unlayered MCP server could do the same filtering / finding. Right?  But it doesn’t matter - dynamically loaded tools or not. \n\nThe agent+LLM is responsible for reasoning through the solution to the problem. It does so with the list of tools it has available. \n\nIt does not know, a priori, what tools it needs. It’s more of an Apollo 13 thing - you know the scene where they dump a bunch of parts and materials on a desktop and say, “ok given this stuff we have available, let’s figure out how to solve the problem.”?  That is what the agent does. \n\nAnd to do that, it wants all the possible tools in the beginning. The MCP server does not participate in this reasoning phase. It has no context beyond which tools the agent has already invoked. It cannot “know” when it is appropriate to dribble out more tools.\n\nGrandpa teaching his 7yr old grandkid how to make a stool, knows the solution, and the steps. Grandpa can say “ok, now that you used the saw, I think you’re going to need the drill.  Do you know why?” Leading the 7 yr old to the solution. The MCP + agent relationship is not like that. The MCP server does not know the problem. Does not know the steps or the sequence of tools necessary. And before the agent sees all the tools, it cannot know that either. \n\nI’m fairly convinced but am open to counter arguments. Explain how the MCP server “knows” when it will need to disclose additional tools, or how the agent will “know” which tools to ask for, before knowing all the possible tools. \n\nYou can offer as an example a “blank slate” agent that searches for and finds tools (MCP servers)… via the equivalent of a google search. that’s a possible avenue. But to make this happen , the agent has to modify its MCP server configuration after doing the search.  \n\nIn which case, there’s no point to filtering tools. Basically the solution devolves into a “assemble tools” phase and a “use tools” phase and in the “use tools” phase, once again, tool filtering isn’t practical or beneficial to reduce the token tax. \n\nLike legos, you can attach pieces in all sorts of ways, but not all of the connections are useful or stable or sensible.

              "text": "You summarize the tension well (with a slight clarification on the streamable option available today).\n\nYou’ve touched on the fact that the MCP spec focuses on **stateless transport**. This feels like short-term gains to help massive, stateless cloud infrastructure. I agree - and that’s exactly the point of my post. They flirt with streaming but miss the opportunity; it’s a massive resource waste simply because true bidirectional streaming is difficult to deploy in large, legacy cloud infrastructure right now.  So I completely agree....\n\n... however ...\n\nAlthough MCP’s approach is \"pragmatic\" - creating an interface that *looks* like streaming - there’s no mention of how they’d ever make the jump to a real persistent transport in the future.  In fact, they're doing the opposite - removing streaming and double downing on stateless. (you touch on this too, just reiterating it for clarity)\n\nTo work around this, I use gRPC extensively already - so totally aware that streaming protocols DO exist - I'm suggesting that MCP should do that.\n\nThe downside is that it doesn’t offer an easily consumable public API for the now-popular chat protocols. However, agentic protocols like **ADK (Agent Development Kit)** or custom gRPC setups are embracing true streaming, leaving the \"popular\" MCP behind. It’s a missing scale on the dragon that I hope gets addressed.\n\n>Streamable HTTP already gives you chunked transfer encoding and progressive delivery over a single connection, which covers most of the streaming use cases.\n\nThe **Streamable HTTP** implementation (please correct me if I’m reading the code wrong) is not \"true\" streaming because the spec is still fundamentally **cursor-based**. The chunks are collected and yielded after the fact - making it \"polling with extra steps.\" This seems intentional, but I don’t see why they can’t offer a streaming option similar to how gRPC handles bidirectional streams.  It's streaming where you need to code like it's not.  Simulating non-streaming on a streaming transfer - blocking... \n\n>The 2026 roadmap is actually moving the opposite direction... toward a stateless protocol where session state lives at the app layer (cookie-style) rather than the transport.\n\nYes... instead of 2026 being the year of HTTP/3, we are scaling like it’s 2001. It works, but it’s putting **rockets on roller skates**.\n\n>The rationale is horizontal scaling. Sticky sessions and distributed state management are the bottleneck for enterprise deployments, not HTTP/1.1 limitations.\n\nI get that, and it is pragmatic. But that mainly helps Google, Amazon, and Oracle while it makes us pay more in data center costs for their ease of deployment.\n\nThe current gRPC spec in the MCP ecosystem doesn't even offer true streaming; it’s just a 1:1 mapping of the MCP JSON-RPC. Again, a miss.   \n  \nSo reeling it back to my point: **MCP is not true streaming, but should be.** I’m not arguing that \"streaming-like\" behavior doesn't exist, but MCP is literally no different than the browser polling mechanisms we’ve seen for 25 years.\n\nIf getting real streaming into the spec conflicts with the \"stateless direction\" they’re pushing, then the line in the sand should be clear: **MCP is for stateless utility; ADK and custom gRPC are for agentic streaming.**",

MCP for discovery and semantics, gRPC for the hot path when you need real streaming. Google Cloud is already shipping pluggable transports in the SDK for exactly this reason.\n\nWhere I'd push back: the June 2026 spec release is targeting stateless-first, but the Transport Working Group has multi-turn SSE as an active SEP. So it's not purely abandoning streaming... it's separating the concerns. Whether that's better or worse depends on your deployment model.",

      "text": "So I've been programming in the metro, when waiting for the doctor, heck even in the bathroom. I mean it's quite the downfall from my dream of sitting in front of multiple large monitors with cmatrix style code, dark hoodies and insane typing speeds with Jarvis handing me my coffee.\n\nBut yeah I think I like this more.\n\nSo wanted to share how I do it, starting with the tools I use: \n\n* Linear for managing my tasks\n* Github for hosting my repo\n* Slack/Telegram for communication (currently in progress, but promising I tell you)\n* LLMs - codex and claude code (expanding to gemini)\n\nHow they come together, imagine this: \n\nUsing Linear on my phone,  I write down a task for my project,  put it in spec status.\n\nFew minutes later I see a spec, read it, if I'm happy,  I set it as ready for dev, few minutes later a PR is ready.\n\nIf there are any failed checks on actions,  no worries few minutes later they're all fixed and ready for merge,  just needs my approval. \n\nI make a few comments, few minutes again all fixed, I look at it again, if I'm happy, I approve and merge. \n\nAnd how long? 30min, maybe an hour max, what could’ve possibly taken me a day or even a week?\n\nHere’s the cool thing, I’m always doing multiple tasks and all in parallel. That was possibly weeks I was saving. Yeah Ik it’s pretty wild.\n\nSo what's happening under the hood?\n\nWell whenever a Linear task is created a webhook is sent to my server (Linear has their webhook Api specs online so you could easily check the data that’s sent back). In the payload, I check whether the sent request is an issue/comment, see if it’s labeled AI (linear allows custom labels) and that the current status is \"Spec\" or \"Ready for dev (custom status), any other status just returns from here.\n\nIf the paylod is an issue and it’s in Spec, the webhook will use linear’s graphql api to comment “Writing spec” and assign itself to the task, fetches latest repo, automatically creates a new worktree, and then launches a docker container with the worktree mounted as a volume, the container has codex/claude in it(you can just use a slim alpine and install codex/claude on it) and passes on the command “work on {issue\\_identifier}”. \n\nThe LLM has linear’s mcp configured (you can check my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1qlhj62/a_few_of_the_mcps_i_use_on_a_daily_basis/) for the MCPs I use) so it can easily fetch the issue contents, see the title and any description in the issue, refer the codebase and write a proper spec directly to linear. I do not kill the container after the spec, mainly to save costs and to reuse context for following tasks.\n\nIf the spec isn’t ideal, I can comment under the spec/issue with the changes I want. Webhook fires-> payload is parsed-> content of the comment is checked, it must include “@ai”, if so it’s meant for the ai, since the container is still alive the llm can re-use the context session, saves me a lot of credit, you’ll thank me for it. Now command is passed- “Amend the spec on issue {issue\\_identifier} according to this comment {comment\\_content}”. The LLM does its thing and posts the new spec.\n\nOnce I’m satisfied with the spec, I move the issue to “Ready for Dev”, another webhook-> parse the payload-> checks issue statuses and sees it’s ready for dev, moves it to \"In Progress\", fetches that same container and passes the command- “Issue {issue\\_identifier} is ready for implementation, start working on it, once finished commit and push to origin with a new PR”.\n\nI’ll continue on another post on how I do the git side of things and communication as well, how I converse with codex/claude about new features and then tell it- “yeah sounds good, start working on on it” and it immediately sets up the linear issue, and does everything on its own, it’s pretty sick. \n\nBut yeah, happy to get any more ways to improve on it, hope this helps and would love to see you guys set up your own coding Jarvis too ;).",

      "text": "When I wanted to test mcp-use (9k+ stars on GitHub), I needed a dataset spicy enough to keep me awake. Enter: 2322 Epstein emails. What followed was an afternoon of hot module reloading, CSP hell, and discovering OpenAI silently requires Plus to use custom apps.\n\n# What I needed\n\n* Basic dependencies (e.g. Node)\n* A `mcp-use` [cloud account](https://mcp-use.com/signup) to host the server (currently free)\n* ChatGPT *Plus* subscription - more on this later\n* Epstein's emails: `https://www.docetl.org/api/epstein-emails`\n\n# Setup\n\nGetting started was trivial. `npx create-mcp-use-app mcp-demo` scaffolds a demo project - I used the `mcp-apps` preset to have both OpenAI Apps SDK integration and a standard MCP server.\n\nThen, a `npm run dev` is enough to see and debug tools (both classic and UI Widgets) thanks to the inspector. This is bundled and starts automatically: a very convenient way to test.\n\n# Development\n\nDeveloping with `mcp-use` is very straightforward. The inspector (paired with HMR, aka \"hot module reload\") makes iterating VERY fast. However, I had a few minor issues with it:\n\n* The setting CSP to \"Declared\" leads to a violation even in the starter template\n* \"Hover: Disabled\" doesn't actually disable hover effects\n* Sometimes, especially when dealing with UI elements, it glitches out - a reload is usually enough\n\nThe library itself abstracts away all of the boilerplate and makes the code concise, for both tools and UI elements. You're writing only the bare minimum: title, description, schema and logic. It feels like what Stripe did for payments, but for tool definitions.\n\nThe best part is that the Model Context Protocol, being very new, hasn't crystallized yet - and you don't have to care. By using a library you're guaranteed to always be compliant and compatible - for example, I imagine Anthropic/Google creating their own variants for UI components.\n\nThe only major issue I had with the library was related to CSP (content security policy): it was not whitelisting the server's domain `fetch` requests. After a few hours of debugging I was ready to open an issue, only to find it already resolved in a development branch by a maintainer (props to Enrico). To quickly patch the issue I hardcoded the CSP `connectDomains` urls and used the PR's canary build: `npm i https://pkg.pr.new/mcp-use/mcp-use@911`. However, I'm sure that by the time you read this it will be already merged.\n\n# Deployment\n\nDeploying using `mcp-use`'s cloud offering is super straightforward: `npm run deploy` takes care of everything. It guides you through login, GitHub repo access, verifies your commits are pushed and finally shows the stream of remote build logs.\n\nIt's also nice that they provide documentation on how to self-host (and even made specific helpers) so vendor lock-in is not an issue. However, I'd still choose their version as it's tailor-made and shows interesting mcp-specific metrics (e.g. client breakdown).\n\nGiven the CSP issue I needed a \"double deploy\" to hardcode the production URL in the widgets code; build environment variables are available but they didn't work consistently for me.\n\n# Testing on ChatGPT\n\nWhen it came time to test, I happily headed to ChatGPT to add my server. It should be easy: Account -> Settings -> Apps -> Advanced Settings -> Enable Dev Mode -> Apps -> Create App.\n\n*However*, after adding the URL and everything, the app wasn't there. After way too much time I found out that the Free Plan doesn't allow you to add custom apps \\[[1](https://community.openai.com/t/chatgpt-apps-sdk-not-creating-a-custom-app-on-my-account/1369338/7), [2](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487775-apps-in-chatgpt)\\] (no warnings whatsoever). This might change in the future so before upgrading take a look.\n\n>Disclaimer: This is not the library's fault, but rather a rant against OpenAI\n\nSo, I had to buy the Plus version (luckily by signing up with a custom domain email I got a month free). While developing, make sure to hit \"refresh\" in the app's section if you make any changes.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n`mcp-use` = Rails for MCP. You write actual logic, boilerplate is handled. Few bugs, nothing blocking. *Use* it.\n\n**Try it yourself:** [https://lively-poetry-gt8c1.mcp-use.run/mcp](https://lively-poetry-gt8c1.mcp-use.run/mcp)\n",
