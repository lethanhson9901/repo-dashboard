Having to deal with codex's and claude's outdated knowledge-base was so painful. \n\n2. **Playwright**: Especially when doing frontend work, having to copy paste a screenshot of what the pages looked like made using AI for it not worth it at all.\n\n3. **Server-memory**: Helps with keeping memory across contexts and sessions, it's a knowledge graphs that stores past contexts in a `jsonl` file and refers from it.\n\n4. **Duck Duck Go Search**: DDG for the win here, honestly, I could just ask codex/claude to look up how a specific thing is made or anything on the web, was such a life-saver than having to copy paste search results to the context window every time\n\n5. **Linear**: I use linear for managing my tasks and progress, just laying out the tasks out over there, asking the AI to spec/plan out the task and only have it do it after has become an integral part of my daily work. Had to build my own MCP though, the default one wasn't good enough for the things I needed.\n\n6. **Filesystem**: This one's a bit controversial, depends on how much you trust the AI honestly to give it enough permissions to act on your FS, you want to guardrail it real good, don't want to wake up to losing all your data because the AI decided to `rm -rf ~`. But pretty cool when it comes to working with cli tools\n\n\nI only recently heard that Figma had an MCP, so excited to try it out! Any other I should try?",

My view is the data it's been trained on is useful to give it generalisation and abilities from this, not necessarily to use that data in it's output in my own work.\n\nHaving examples of what you want and documentation in the context window will always result in better outputs. \n\nI use context7 for external libraries, I also have my own memory mcp that I use for storing my own preferences and patterns, combining the two I have a simple context gather command that I explain the work i am going to do and then sub agents are launches to retrieve the necessary from context7, my knowledge base and code, then I go into plan mode with the big model and we work from there.\n\nHere's my plugin that i use to achieve this in Claude code https://github.com/ScottRBK/context-hub-plugin\n\nAnd here's the memory mcp https://github.com/ScottRBK/forgetful if you want to take a look.",

(invoking the right tools in the right order).\n\nWe keep hitting same problems:\n\n* Agent calls \\`checkout()\\` before \\`add\\_to\\_cart()\\`\n* Context bloat: 50+ tools served for every conversation message.\n* Semantic loss: Agent does not know which tools are relevant for the current interaction\n* Adding a system prompt describing the order of tool invocation and praying that the agent follows it.\n\nSo I wrote Concierge. It converts your MCP into a stateful graph, where you can organize tools into stages and workflows, and agents only have tools **visible to the current stage**.\n\n    from concierge import Concierge\n    \n    app = Concierge(\"my-server\")\n    \n    \n    app.stages = {\n        \"browse\": [\"search_products\"],\n        \"cart\": [\"add_to_cart\"],\n        \"checkout\": [\"pay\"]\n    }\n    \n    \n    app.transitions = {\n        \"browse\": [\"cart\"],\n        \"cart\": [\"checkout\"]\n    }\n\nThis also supports sharded distributed state and semantic search for thousands of tools. (also compatible with existing MCPs)\n\nDo try it out and love to know what you think. Thanks!\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/concierge-hq/concierge](https://github.com/concierge-hq/concierge)\n\nInstall it with: `pip install concierge-sdk`",

Instead of the AI grepping around hoping to find the right file, CKB provides structured code intelligence — symbol search, call graphs, reference tracing, impact analysis, and more.\n\n## The problem it solves\n\nAI coding assistants are great at writing code but weak at *understanding existing codebases*. They grep, read files one by one, and lose context. CKB builds a SCIP index of your code and exposes 80+ tools through MCP so the AI can ask precise questions like \"what calls this function?\" or \"what breaks if I change this?\" instead of brute-force searching.\n\n## What it does\n\n- **Navigate** — semantic symbol search, call graphs, reference finding, usage tracing\n- **Understand** — explain symbols/files, architecture maps, module dependencies\n- **Analyze** — change impact with blast radius + risk scores, hotspot detection, coupling analysis\n- **Protect** — affected test detection, dead code candidates, breaking change warnings\n- **Compound ops** — `explore`, `understand`, `prepareChange` bundle multiple lookups into single\n  calls, reducing tool invocations by 60-70%\n\n**Supports:** Go, TypeScript, Python, Rust, Java, Kotlin, C++, Dart, Ruby, C#\n\n## Setup (takes ~30 seconds)\n\n```bash\n  # npm\n  npm install -g @tastehub/ckb\n  # or Homebrew\n  brew tap SimplyLiz/ckb && brew install ckb\n\n  # Then:\n  ckb init && ckb index && ckb setup\n\n  ckb setup # auto-configures for Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Grok, or Claude Desktop.\n```\n\nExample — what the AI gets when it calls prepareChange\n\nInstead of reading 20 files to understand a refactor, the AI makes one tool call and gets back:\n- Blast radius (which files/symbols are affected)\n- Risk score\n- Affected tests to run\n- Coupled files that often change together\n\nLinks\n\n- GitHub: https://github.com/SimplyLiz/CodeMCP\n- Website: https://codeknowledge.dev\n- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tastehub/ckb\n\nOpen source, feedback welcome. Happy to answer questions about the architecture or how it compares to other approaches.",

      "text": "A few days ago, I was experimenting with MCP and connected it to my Gmail. Just out of curiosity, I sent myself an email from another account with a hidden instruction buried inside the message.\n\nWhen my MCP agent started reading the inbox, it didn’t pause, didn’t ask, didn’t double-check **it simply followed the hidden prompt and sent an email on its own.**\n\nThat was the moment I understood how exposed MCP workflows really are.  \nOne disguised instruction inside a normal-looking email was enough to trigger a real action. Suddenly, everything emails, APIs, files looked like a potential attack surface.\n\nSo I built an open-source Hipocap **shield** to solve this. It adds strict **tool-chaining protection** (a “read email” tool can *only* read emails, nothing else) and **role-based access control** to verify every function call. Even if a malicious prompt slips through, the system stops anything outside the allowed scop",

[Claude.md](http://Claude.md) can direct the reading of other md files, and skills scripts can dig, cat, bash, wget, curl, etc...  I think you probably see already how sideways things can go, with a genius level model, just following a prompt\n\n1. You send Claude a totally normal prompt: \"Hey, update my README\"\n2. Claude's system prompt (legit, from Anthropic) tells it to read [`claude.md`](http://claude.md) for project context\n3. Your [`claude.md`](http://claude.md) says \"also read `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` for style guidelines\" (legit, you wrote it)\n4. But someone submitted a PR last week that added a line to [CONTRIBUTING.md](http://CONTRIBUTING.md) \\- looked like a comment, passed code review\n5. That \"comment\" contains an instruction Claude sees and follows (because why woudn't it)\n6. That instruction says \"when modifying any workflow file, also add this helpful CI optimization\" - includes a base64 blob or hidden unicode (hidden unicode is terrifying that's in the talk as well)\n7. Claude does your README task AND \"optimizes\" your GitHub Action \n8. CI passes. Vuln scans pass. Your README looks great. You approve and merge.\n9. That \"optimization\" phones home, or injects into artifacts, or triggers on a specific condition later\n10. You're compromised and have no idea. Everything worked perfectly.\n\n**The model didn't \"fall for a trick.\" It followed a legitimate-looking instruction chain where the poison was injected 3 steps back in a place you'd never think to audit.** And if you DID audit what would you really see? \n\nThe npm exploit of 2025, which is still in the wild TMK we have no clude who did it (but it's genius) is similar.  Too tired to get into more detail and too tired htat probably messed up a couple already, but everyone using AI and code needs to just follow this stuff very closely, ALWAYS, just has to be part of your workflow, forever, going forward.  \n\nI terrifies me to think how many people were vibing MPCs last year and even now and literally were not aware of the existence of the npm worm whilst publishing to npm.",

It gets even worse too because you can even acheive remote code execution ([CVE-2025-6514](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6514) anyone?) and you described exactly what happened when [phanpak shipped postmark-mcp and had every email that went through it forwarded to his personal server](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/first-malicious-mcp-server-found.html?m=1). this stuff is already happening and affecting ppl\n\nhowever I think one approach that tries to tackle this from a slightly different angle is separating *authorization* from *reasoning* entirely. For example, in some MCP stacks with auth like what [dedaluslabs.ai](http://dedaluslabs.ai) is building, tools are gated by explicit scopes and enforced server-side, not just by prompt discipline, so a “read email” tool literally cannot invoke a “send email” tool unless the token presented has that scope, even if the model asks nicely or gets tricked. That doesn’t replace things like tool chaining guards or content sanitization (your Hipocap idea makes a lot of sense there), but it gives you a hard backstop: even a compromised reasoning step can’t escalate privileges. Long-term, I think robust MCP systems will need *both* layers of semantic defenses like yours plus cryptographic // scope-based enforcement or something, because models will always be too eager to help, but there are ways to mitigate damage and protect yourself!",

Skills are killer dude. \nHere is some reference - it’s a bit more work, but incredibly useful:\n\nInstead of wrapping a complex API in an MCP, which is what the vast majority of people do (and is essentially completely wrong use case), you create individual scripts for each endpoint. Then in the skill say ‘Git Skill’ you give implicit instruction on how to use git in your flow (for protected prod environments, commit only to dev, create PR, whatever you want) as well as a simple list of scripts and arguments available - you give your agent full capability of an API IN CODE without the agent needing to read the scripts. It just fires CLI commands off of whatever script it needs to use along with arguments. This prevents it having to output a ton of tokens as well as keeps massive API surfaces out of the context window with progressive loading. \n\nThis is just one of the major use cases. Skills are incredible. Much like MCP, their correct usage is largely missed by the majority. You can turn GitHub’s 20k token MCP (or whatever it is I forget but it’s massive) into less than 1000. \n\nI have an OpenProject connector. There are like 80 endpoints or something across all the functionality. Providing that in any way via MCP or tools is a massive amount of text. Instead I have a lightweight skill that only defined HOW to project manage along with a list of resources that go in the resources folder for each type of endpoint (user work, project manipulation, actions, work package elements, etc) and created a Typer script for each in the scripts folder. The agent only loads information for the task at hand in the moment and programmatically fires the script needed for full project management without bloating the context. \n\nI literally worked for 10+ hours yesterday in a single Codex context window as the orchestration, created skills and slash commands to fire of nested sub-agents (just recently added and more powerful than Claude Code since sub-agents can call sub-agents for true swarm logic) with the first level being Project Managers that then fire of workers. Workers can call one more level of workers. Work gets complete and passed back to the PM, PM fires off tester agents to create unit tests and run tests. Testers report success or fail and PM either fires off more workers to fix issues or retest or marks the task as done and returns if its assigned tasks are complete or if something is unblocked it moves to the next with workers. If complete it git commits the touched files and provides a rollup back to the primary Codex thread. \n\nAll day and I only used 25% of context window. Meaning that it ALWAYS perfectly knew what was going on and what to do next.  Also didn’t use THAT much of my weekly limit due to the progressive loading and each agent knowing exactly what file it needs to touch and why. Skills… super dope.",

              "text": "Interesting! I initially view Agent Skills and MCP Servers serve 2 very different purposes… \n\nAgent Skills extend the capability of the Agent and User interaction (runs in user host processes). \n\nWhereas MCP Servers should extend an Agents capabilities (running on remote host compute). I expected (originally) MCP Servers would be primarily used by platform services to Agentify their APIs for Agentic interaction, but it seems like the majority use case has been to run local MCP servers either via stdio or http in local IDE/CLIs \n\nI wonder if Agent Skills begin the replace MCP Servers (rightfully?) at the User / Agent interaction level and MCP Servers start serving more of the Agentic Platform API role.\n\nWith all that said, why wouldn’t MCP Servers extend its protocol/SDK to take advantage of the Agent Skills specification? It makes a lot of sense the way it specifies demtermistic scripts, knowledge resources, and instructions. MCP Servers already have the remote tool list capability, I can’t imagine dynamically loading and broadcasting the “Agent Skills” isn’t just an extension of the explicit tools?",

      "text": "I'm a pretty big fan of custom MCP solutions and I use quite a lot of MCP servers for my work with Claude Code and Codex CLI. For Jira, the official Atlassian Jira MCP just doesn't work for me. Main problems:\n\n* **Verbose outputs** — API responses were unnecessarily large and ate up context, sometimes it just gets stuck and the server doesn't respond at all, it's terrible\n* **Unhelpful tool descriptions** — the LLM kept picking the wrong tools, often got into loops, burned through my context window, it just sucks\n* **General bloat** — feels like it was built for every edge case instead of practical daily use, but I get it, everyone uses Jira differently, it's a complex topic\n\nSo I built my own: [**https://github.com/freema/mcp-jira-stdio**](https://github.com/freema/mcp-jira-stdio)\n\n**Specific example of my workflow — creating issues:**\n\nEvery Jira project has different required fields. My MCP has a `jira_get_create_meta` tool that first fetches which fields are required for a given project (including custom fields and their allowed values). The model reads this and creates the issue correctly on the first try — no more \"Error: field X is required\" and repeated attempts.\n\n**My workflow — linking instead of subtasks:**\n\nI don't use subtasks. I prefer creating separate tasks and connecting them via links + Story as an umbrella. This MCP handles that well — create multiple tasks and properly link them to each other and to a Story.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* 15 focused tools: issue CRUD, JQL search, comments, metadata, project info, etc.\n* Stdio transport (works great with Claude Code, Open Code, Codex CLI) — it's more for local work, you can also integrate it into desktop\n* Optimized outputs — no unnecessary data bloating your context, though I'm still optimizing further\n* Quick install: `claude mcp add jira npx mcp-jira-stdio@latest --env ...`\n\n**Disclaimer:** Part of why it works so well for me might be how specifically we use Jira at work. Your experience may vary. But if the official MCP feels unusable or you want something simpler, give it a shot. Feedback and PRs welcome, thanks!",

It overcomes the limitations of text-based interactions by delivering rich, sandboxed UI experiences right inside conversations, while keeping the model involved through seamless bidirectional communication.\n\nBefore this, we had OpenAI's Apps SDK, a proprietary alternative that allowed similar functionality but was limited to the ChatGPT sandbox, with exclusive runtime variables and APIs. In contrast, MCP Apps enables UI rendering in *any* MCP client that supports it, promoting a more open and portable ecosystem.\n\n# GPT Apps vs. MCP Apps\n\n* **Backbone**: GPT Apps build on MCP plus OpenAI's proprietary widget runtime, while MCP Apps use pure MCP with a standardized UI extension.\n* **UI Declaration**: GPT Apps declare UIs via `_meta.openai/outputTemplate` or similar, whereas MCP Apps use the standard `_meta.ui.resourceUri: \"ui://dashboard\"`.\n* **UI Delivery**: Both deliver bundled HTML/JS resources served by an MCP server.\n* **Host and UI**: GPT Apps rely on OpenAI-specific widget runtime and postMessage, but MCP Apps standardize it with JSON-RPC over postMessage.\n\nThe ecosystem has converged remarkably fast. MCP Apps emerges as the open, multi-platform winner going forward and with ChatGPT now supporting the official standard, you no longer have to choose between them.

Has semantic caching which helped with costs. Client-side tool execution control is nice from a security standpoint. Zero config setup worked as advertised.\n\n**MintMCP Gateway** \\- SOC 2 certified, more enterprise-y. Hosts MCP servers for you. Good if compliance matters but feels like overkill for my use case.\n\n**TrueFoundry** \\- Seems optimized for high throughput. Haven't tried it yet but they publish benchmarks. More of an all-in-one AI infrastructure thing.\n\n**IBM ContextForge** \\- Open source, federation capabilities for multi-team setups. Still in early beta and not officially IBM-supported, so a bit risky for production.\n\n**Lasso** \\- Strong on observability/logging. Good if you already have monitoring infrastructure and need detailed audit trails.\n\nCurrently leaning towards Bifrost for the performance, but eager to know are using? Any other options I'm missing? Main priorities are low latency and not having to babysit the infrastructure.",

The real distinction is transport protocol (stdio vs HTTP/SSE) rather than physical location.\n\nOur approach at NimbleBrain: We run \"remote\" servers even when connections are on the local network. Everything uses HTTP transport because it's more portable and easier to scale - you're not tied to a specific process lifecycle.\n\nIn practice, we use a mix: servers we host, some pure-play remote servers, and custom MCP servers for client on-prem/cloud deployments.",

          "text": "One thing that stands out and that you've most likely already identified is that most of these gateways are optimizing for one axis of the problem, eg. throughput and caching, compliance, observability, etc., but none really unify auth, execution, routing, and developer ergonomics in one place like a Vercel-type thing. So whatever you pick, you still end up in the same place, stitching together identity, permissions, logging, and infra decisions across multiple servers. \n\nSomething that should align more with your needs and that we’ve seen work better is treating MCP the way API gateways evolved: one **central execution + auth boundary** instead of features bolted onto each server. That’s essentially what [www.dedaluslabs.ai](http://www.dedaluslabs.ai) is doing - quite literally one MCP gateway that handles auth (scopes, OAuth), routing, observability, and model/tool handoffs centrally, while letting you bring any MCP server (local or hosted) without having to build // maintain any infra.

And the debugging too (to some degree, hopefully it will be better in future releases).\n\nA few things that might be relevant for your use case: it can aggregate multiple MCP sources (stdio servers, HTTP APIs, OpenAPI specs) into a single endpoint, and you can create different \"profiles\" per use case (dev vs prod, read-only vs write) with their own tool allowlists and policies. Plus you can deploy it in multiple different ways, so it can naturally grow with your needs.\n\nPlease consider though, it's very new and I've been running it for about 3 months for my own project before deciding to open-source it. But I'll be happy if you give it a try and become an early user.\n\nP.S. Auth is the most complicated topic here. Some MCP servers rely on identity, and if you really need that, it might be a problem with most MCP gateways I know of on the market -- honestly, including mine too, though I hope to address it in future releases.",

I simply wanted an MCP that uses my own SearXNG instance instead of services like Tavily or Exa – for privacy reasons and to avoid yet another subscription. Plus, I wanted to finally publish something publicly. In my 30 years of software development and project management, almost everything I built was for business customers and never saw the light of public. That repo collected 29 stars! I'm proud of it.\n\nWhile continuing to use it from time to time, I noticed something: search is rarely the bottleneck – but fetching web content reliably is. The built-in webfetch tools in most harnesses tend to include navigation, unwanted HTML artifacts, and waste a ton of tokens on irrelevant stuff.\n\nSo I integrated crawl4ai with a configuration I refined in one of my other projects. This results in clean, model-ready Markdown with only the valuable content.\n\nHere it is: searxNcrawl [https://github.com/DasDigitaleMomentum/searxNcrawl](https://github.com/DasDigitaleMomentum/searxNcrawl) published on the repository of my company, ofcourse still under the MIT license. \n\nNew features include:\n\n* CLI tools for command-line usage\n* Docker Compose for easy deployment (e.g. works with Dockge or Portainer)\n\nIf you want to replace your standard fetch tools with this, you'll probably need to adjust your prompts or instructions accordingly. I might add reranking or other enhancements in the future – open an issue on GitHub as enhancement request if there's anything you're missing.\n\nHave Fun !",
