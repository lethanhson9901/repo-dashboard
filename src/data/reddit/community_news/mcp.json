Having to deal with codex's and claude's outdated knowledge-base was so painful. \n\n2. **Playwright**: Especially when doing frontend work, having to copy paste a screenshot of what the pages looked like made using AI for it not worth it at all.\n\n3. **Server-memory**: Helps with keeping memory across contexts and sessions, it's a knowledge graphs that stores past contexts in a `jsonl` file and refers from it.\n\n4. **Duck Duck Go Search**: DDG for the win here, honestly, I could just ask codex/claude to look up how a specific thing is made or anything on the web, was such a life-saver than having to copy paste search results to the context window every time\n\n5. **Linear**: I use linear for managing my tasks and progress, just laying out the tasks out over there, asking the AI to spec/plan out the task and only have it do it after has become an integral part of my daily work. Had to build my own MCP though, the default one wasn't good enough for the things I needed.\n\n6. **Filesystem**: This one's a bit controversial, depends on how much you trust the AI honestly to give it enough permissions to act on your FS, you want to guardrail it real good, don't want to wake up to losing all your data because the AI decided to `rm -rf ~`. But pretty cool when it comes to working with cli tools\n\n\nI only recently heard that Figma had an MCP, so excited to try it out! Any other I should try?",

That too without indexing It’s especially helpful for issue + commit context grounding and repo exploration. \n\nSlack / Messaging MCP: that“wow” factor with very low effort. Once an agent can talk where humans already are, teams love it instantly. My team even used this for something as basic as ordering and tracking deliveries for team lunch, which ended up being one of the most-used workflows for us.\n\nGitHub MCP: This is what finally made Claude feel like an actual teammate instead of a smarter autocomplete. If you’re tired of copy-pasting repos into prompts, you’re gonna love it. It’s especially helpful for issue + commit context grounding and repo exploration.\n\nSuper curious to hear what MCPs all of you have found useful?",

(invoking the right tools in the right order).\n\nWe keep hitting same problems:\n\n* Agent calls \\`checkout()\\` before \\`add\\_to\\_cart()\\`\n* Context bloat: 50+ tools served for every conversation message.\n* Semantic loss: Agent does not know which tools are relevant for the current interaction\n* Adding a system prompt describing the order of tool invocation and praying that the agent follows it.\n\nSo I wrote Concierge. It converts your MCP into a stateful graph, where you can organize tools into stages and workflows, and agents only have tools **visible to the current stage**.\n\n    from concierge import Concierge\n    \n    app = Concierge(\"my-server\")\n    \n    \n    app.stages = {\n        \"browse\": [\"search_products\"],\n        \"cart\": [\"add_to_cart\"],\n        \"checkout\": [\"pay\"]\n    }\n    \n    \n    app.transitions = {\n        \"browse\": [\"cart\"],\n        \"cart\": [\"checkout\"]\n    }\n\nThis also supports sharded distributed state and semantic search for thousands of tools. (also compatible with existing MCPs)\n\nDo try it out and love to know what you think. Thanks!\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/concierge-hq/concierge](https://github.com/concierge-hq/concierge)\n\nInstall it with: `pip install concierge-sdk`",

For backtracking scenarios like abandoned carts mid-checkout, the cleanest pattern I've seen is treating reverse transitions as explicit stages rather than reverse edges.

I've seen teams waste weeks debugging config drift when both concerns are tangled in one server.\n\nFor long-term memory: check out Mem0's OpenMemory MCP or the doobidoo/mcp-memory-service repo. Both do semantic indexing so the agent retrieves relevant context instead of dumping everything into the prompt. The key is scoped memory keys... user_id + namespace prevents contamination across sessions.\n\nOne thing I'd push back on: CLAUDE.md works for project context but doesn't scale for user-specific state across multiple projects.

Instead of the AI grepping around hoping to find the right file, CKB provides structured code intelligence — symbol search, call graphs, reference tracing, impact analysis, and more.\n\n## The problem it solves\n\nAI coding assistants are great at writing code but weak at *understanding existing codebases*. They grep, read files one by one, and lose context. CKB builds a SCIP index of your code and exposes 80+ tools through MCP so the AI can ask precise questions like \"what calls this function?\" or \"what breaks if I change this?\" instead of brute-force searching.\n\n## What it does\n\n- **Navigate** — semantic symbol search, call graphs, reference finding, usage tracing\n- **Understand** — explain symbols/files, architecture maps, module dependencies\n- **Analyze** — change impact with blast radius + risk scores, hotspot detection, coupling analysis\n- **Protect** — affected test detection, dead code candidates, breaking change warnings\n- **Compound ops** — `explore`, `understand`, `prepareChange` bundle multiple lookups into single\n  calls, reducing tool invocations by 60-70%\n\n**Supports:** Go, TypeScript, Python, Rust, Java, Kotlin, C++, Dart, Ruby, C#\n\n## Setup (takes ~30 seconds)\n\n```bash\n  # npm\n  npm install -g @tastehub/ckb\n  # or Homebrew\n  brew tap SimplyLiz/ckb && brew install ckb\n\n  # Then:\n  ckb init && ckb index && ckb setup\n\n  ckb setup # auto-configures for Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Grok, or Claude Desktop.\n```\n\nExample — what the AI gets when it calls prepareChange\n\nInstead of reading 20 files to understand a refactor, the AI makes one tool call and gets back:\n- Blast radius (which files/symbols are affected)\n- Risk score\n- Affected tests to run\n- Coupled files that often change together\n\nLinks\n\n- GitHub: https://github.com/SimplyLiz/CodeMCP\n- Website: https://codeknowledge.dev\n- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tastehub/ckb\n\nOpen source, feedback welcome.

It overcomes the limitations of text-based interactions by delivering rich, sandboxed UI experiences right inside conversations, while keeping the model involved through seamless bidirectional communication.\n\nBefore this, we had OpenAI's Apps SDK, a proprietary alternative that allowed similar functionality but was limited to the ChatGPT sandbox, with exclusive runtime variables and APIs. In contrast, MCP Apps enables UI rendering in *any* MCP client that supports it, promoting a more open and portable ecosystem.\n\n# GPT Apps vs. MCP Apps\n\n* **Backbone**: GPT Apps build on MCP plus OpenAI's proprietary widget runtime, while MCP Apps use pure MCP with a standardized UI extension.\n* **UI Declaration**: GPT Apps declare UIs via `_meta.openai/outputTemplate` or similar, whereas MCP Apps use the standard `_meta.ui.resourceUri: \"ui://dashboard\"`.\n* **UI Delivery**: Both deliver bundled HTML/JS resources served by an MCP server.\n* **Host and UI**: GPT Apps rely on OpenAI-specific widget runtime and postMessage, but MCP Apps standardize it with JSON-RPC over postMessage.\n\nThe ecosystem has converged remarkably fast. MCP Apps emerges as the open, multi-platform winner going forward and with ChatGPT now supporting the official standard, you no longer have to choose between them. OpenAI may even phase out their proprietary development in the near future.\n\n",

Has semantic caching which helped with costs. Client-side tool execution control is nice from a security standpoint. Zero config setup worked as advertised.\n\n**MintMCP Gateway** \\- SOC 2 certified, more enterprise-y. Hosts MCP servers for you. Good if compliance matters but feels like overkill for my use case.\n\n**TrueFoundry** \\- Seems optimized for high throughput. Haven't tried it yet but they publish benchmarks. More of an all-in-one AI infrastructure thing.\n\n**IBM ContextForge** \\- Open source, federation capabilities for multi-team setups. Still in early beta and not officially IBM-supported, so a bit risky for production.\n\n**Lasso** \\- Strong on observability/logging. Good if you already have monitoring infrastructure and need detailed audit trails.\n\nCurrently leaning towards Bifrost for the performance, but eager to know are using?

          "text": "One thing that stands out and that you've most likely already identified is that most of these gateways are optimizing for one axis of the problem, eg. throughput and caching, compliance, observability, etc., but none really unify auth, execution, routing, and developer ergonomics in one place like a Vercel-type thing. So whatever you pick, you still end up in the same place, stitching together identity, permissions, logging, and infra decisions across multiple servers. \n\nSomething that should align more with your needs and that we’ve seen work better is treating MCP the way API gateways evolved: one **central execution + auth boundary** instead of features bolted onto each server. That’s essentially what [www.dedaluslabs.ai](http://www.dedaluslabs.ai) is doing - quite literally one MCP gateway that handles auth (scopes, OAuth), routing, observability, and model/tool handoffs centrally, while letting you bring any MCP server (local or hosted) without having to build // maintain any infra. Hope this helps narrow your search!",

And the debugging too (to some degree, hopefully it will be better in future releases).\n\nA few things that might be relevant for your use case: it can aggregate multiple MCP sources (stdio servers, HTTP APIs, OpenAPI specs) into a single endpoint, and you can create different \"profiles\" per use case (dev vs prod, read-only vs write) with their own tool allowlists and policies. Plus you can deploy it in multiple different ways, so it can naturally grow with your needs.\n\nPlease consider though, it's very new and I've been running it for about 3 months for my own project before deciding to open-source it. But I'll be happy if you give it a try and become an early user.\n\nP.S. Auth is the most complicated topic here. Some MCP servers rely on identity, and if you really need that, it might be a problem with most MCP gateways I know of on the market -- honestly, including mine too, though I hope to address it in future releases.",

I simply wanted an MCP that uses my own SearXNG instance instead of services like Tavily or Exa – for privacy reasons and to avoid yet another subscription. Plus, I wanted to finally publish something publicly. In my 30 years of software development and project management, almost everything I built was for business customers and never saw the light of public. That repo collected 29 stars! I'm proud of it.\n\nWhile continuing to use it from time to time, I noticed something: search is rarely the bottleneck – but fetching web content reliably is. The built-in webfetch tools in most harnesses tend to include navigation, unwanted HTML artifacts, and waste a ton of tokens on irrelevant stuff.\n\nSo I integrated crawl4ai with a configuration I refined in one of my other projects. This results in clean, model-ready Markdown with only the valuable content.\n\nHere it is: searxNcrawl [https://github.com/DasDigitaleMomentum/searxNcrawl](https://github.com/DasDigitaleMomentum/searxNcrawl) published on the repository of my company, ofcourse still under the MIT license. \n\nNew features include:\n\n* CLI tools for command-line usage\n* Docker Compose for easy deployment (e.g. works with Dockge or Portainer)\n\nIf you want to replace your standard fetch tools with this, you'll probably need to adjust your prompts or instructions accordingly. I might add reranking or other enhancements in the future – open an issue on GitHub as enhancement request if there's anything you're missing.\n\nHave Fun !",

      "text": "AI agents are getting really good at doing things, but they're completely blind to their physical surroundings.\n\nIf you walk into a hotel and you have an AI assistant (like the Chatgpt mobile app), it has no idea there may be a concierge agent on the network that could help you book a spa, check breakfast times, or request late checkout. Same thing at offices, hospitals, cruise ships. The agents are there, but there's no way to discover them.\n\nA2A (Google's agent-to-agent protocol) handles how agents talk to each other. MCP handles how agents use tools. But neither answers a basic question: how do you find agents in the first place?\n\nSo I built LAD-A2A, a simple discovery protocol. When you connect to a Wi-Fi, your agent can automatically find what's available using mDNS (like how AirDrop finds nearby devices) or a standard HTTP endpoint.\n\nThe spec is intentionally minimal. I didn't want to reinvent A2A or create another complex standard. LAD-A2A just handles discovery, then hands off to A2A for actual communication.\n\nOpen source, Apache 2.0. Includes a working Python implementation you can run to see it in action. Repo can be found at franzvill/lad.\n\nCurious what people think!",
