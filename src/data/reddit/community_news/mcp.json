If a config gets updated, the agent won't blindly trust the new version without re-verification. That way a compromised account can't silently swap in a malicious config.\n\nFor the hub itself, even something simple like showing a diff when configs change and requiring a cooldown period before new versions go live would catch most drive-by attacks. GitHub auth is a decent start, but you'd probably want contributor reputation scores based on how many configs they've submitted and how long those configs have been live without issues.\n\nThe harder problem is runtime isolation. Configs that tell an agent to interact with a banking site need to be treated differently than configs for a weather app. Some kind of permission tier system where sensitive-domain configs get extra scrutiny would go a long way.",

In that case, it’s similar to how we already trust the services we use. If my agent interacts with YouTube through the official Web MCP API, I’m trusting YouTube the same way I already trust them not to steal my cookies or leak/sell my data to malicious actors. The trust boundary is the platform itself, not some unknown contributor. That said, security is still critical. The agent communicating with an MCP server shouldn’t have access to sensitive local data in the first place. Even when talking to an official MCP endpoint, it should operate with strict scoping and least-privilege access, so no confidential information can be exposed unintentionally.",

      "text": "We launched Alai's MCP server a few weeks back and it's been crazy to see the workflows users and even our internal team have built from it. Wanted to share some of the common/useful ones that I feel could be helpful.\n\nIt connects to Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, and most other MCP clients. Setup takes a couple minutes, just grab an API key from [app.getalai.com](https://app.getalai.com/) and add the config to your client. Full docs here: [docs.getalai.com/api/mcp](https://docs.getalai.com/api/mcp)\n\nThe real power is combining it with other MCP servers. Here are some workflows we've been seeing:\n\n**Research → Deck in one conversation** Ask your agent to research a topic, refine an outline together, then say \"now create this as a presentation.\" No context switching, no copy-pasting between apps.\n\n**Internal docs → Pitch deck** Pair it with Notion MCP (or similar) to pull from your product roadmap, financials, team bios, etc. and generate a polished investor deck from all of it. One prompt, multiple sources.\n\n**Live data → Weekly reports** Connect it alongside Stripe, PostHog, or whatever analytics tools you use. \"Pull this week's metrics and make me a 5-slide marketing update\" - what used to take an afternoon now takes minutes. Save the prompt as a template and rerun it next week with fresh data. Most useful for weekly marketing/sales reviews\n\n**Meeting notes → Sales proposal** Right after a discovery call, feed your notes in and have it generate a tailored proposal deck while the conversation is still fresh. Combine with your company docs MCP to pull in standard pricing and case studies automatically.\n\nIt handles generating full decks, adding/deleting individual slides, speaker notes, and exporting to PPTX, PDF, or shareable links. You can also edit decks afterwards in Alai's editor or download the PPTX and tweak in PowerPoint.\n\nA few tips for best results: be specific about slide count, specify design/tone preferences, and iterate on the outline in conversation before generating - it's much faster than regenerating entire decks.\n\nWould love to hear what workflows others come up with or any feedback on the setup experience. Also happy to learn about existing presentation MCP experiences and what can be improved in the space.",

Once a theme is created, the fonts/colors etc will be locked in and will be used consistently across decks. You will also be able to lock in templates (slide layouts) across presentations if needed.\n\nNot sure what you mean by citation links. However, you can make API requests per slide to get the transcription of that slide for auditing. If you add citation links to your raw content and ask the AI to put it on the slide in the footer then yes, that's possible as well.\n\nWould love to discuss this further and see how we can solve this end to end for you.

      "text": "In the process of building Airia’s MCP Gateway, and implementing over 600 servers into it, I have had a front row seat in witnessing the evolution of the standard.  \n  \nIt's interesting to see the convergence from community-built local MCPs to remote MCPs. While most of the 700ish remote MCPs I've seen are still in the preview stage, the trend is clearly moving towards OAuth servers with a mcp.{baseurl}/mcp format. And more often than not, the newest servers require redirect-URL whitelisting, which was extremely scarce just a few months ago.\n\n\n\nThis redirect-URL whitelisting, while extremely annoying to those of us building MCP clients, is actually an amazing sign. The services implementing it are correctly understanding the security features required in this new paradigm. They've put actual thought into creating their MCP servers and are actively addressing weak points that can (and will) arise. That investment into security indicates, at least to me, that these services are in it for the long haul and won't just deprecate their server after a bad actor finds an exploit.\n\n\n\nThis new standard format is extremely helpful for the entire MCP ecosystem. With a local GitHub MCP server, you're flipping a coin and hoping the creator is actually related to the service and isn't just stealing your API keys and your data. Being able to see the base URL of an official remote server is reassuring in a way local servers never were. The explosion of thousands of local MCPs was cool; it showed the excitement and demand for the technology, but let's be honest, a lot of those were pretty sketchy. The movement from thousands of unofficial local servers to hundreds of official remote servers linked directly to the base URL of the service marks an important shift. It's a lot easier to navigate a curated harbor of hundreds of official servers than an open ocean of thousands of unvetted local ones.\n\n\n\nThe burden of maintenance also gets pushed from the end user to the actual service provider. The rare required user actions are things like updating the URL from /sse to /mcp or moving from no auth or an API key to much more secure OAuth via DCR. This moves MCP from a novelty requiring significant upfront investment to an easy, reliable, and secure connection to the services we actually use. That's the difference between a toy we play around with before forgetting and a useful tool with long-term staying power.",

Like, if you're connecting to 10+ remote MCPs through a gateway, who's enforcing which tools can actually fire, tracking what each call did, and making sure a compromised server can't escalate through the gateway to reach other services?\n\nRedirect-URL whitelisting solves the front door, but the hallway between rooms is still pretty open in most setups I've seen.

We can go into why next, but I thought that was general knowledge.\n\nAnyway - a streaming protocol will make handshaking easier and allow for a lot of these old school headaches to just go away.

Also worth treating the MCP server like any other dependency: pin identities, log every call (what, who, which data), and fail closed when auth or data pulls are partial.\n\nWe’re working on this at Clyra (open source here): [https://github.com/Clyra-AI](https://github.com/Clyra-AI)",

This supports many humans and many machines.   \nPersonally I use only 2 instances of claude code. But this is not trying to replace that workflow. This is a proof of concept that use cases for Swarm or CrewAI can be boiled down to a few simple tool calls. I honestly don't know what the use cases for those are either. But I can imagine that if I had a custom workflow like research, plan, implement, review, using different models, it would be configurable as text instructions and Cord would just figure it out on the fly.

      "text": "We all run a ton of MCP servers in Cursor today. GitHub, Supabase, Stripe, Playwright... the list keeps growing because that's what makes our workflows fast and automated.\n\nThe problem is that every single server starts at launch and stays resident in memory, even when you're not using it. If you're running 10-15 servers, that's several GBs of RAM sitting there doing nothing. For anyone on a machine with limited memory, that's a real issue.\n\nSo I built **mcp-on-demand** — a proxy that sits between Cursor and your MCP servers. Instead of starting everything at launch, it starts servers only when you actually call a tool, then kills them after 5 minutes of inactivity. All your tools stay available in Cursor exactly as before, but servers only run when needed.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* **Lazy loading** — servers spawn on-demand, not at startup. All your tools remain visible in Cursor, but the actual server processes only run when called. RAM drops from GBs to \\~50 MB\n* **Auto-detection** — reads your existing `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, no manual config needed\n* **Web dashboard** — visual UI to add, remove, edit your MCP servers without touching JSON files. Opens automatically after install\n* **Auto-migration** — one command detects your servers, migrates them, and opens the dashboard\n* **Optional Tool Search mode** — for advanced users who want to reduce context token usage even further\n\n**How to install:**\n\n**Step 1** — Add mcp-on-demand to your `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"mcp-on-demand\": {\n          \"command\": \"npx\",\n          \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@soflution/mcp-on-demand\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    \n\n**Step 2** — Run one command:\n\n    npx /mcp-on-demand setup\n    \n\nThis automatically:\n\n1. Detects all your existing MCP servers\n2. Backs up your config\n3. Migrates everything into the proxy\n4. Opens the visual dashboard in your browser\n\nFrom the dashboard you can see all your servers, add new ones, edit API keys, remove what you don't need — everything visual, no JSON.\n\n**Step 3** — Restart Cursor. Done.\n\n**Who this is for:**\n\n* Cursor users running multiple MCP servers who want to keep their machine responsive\n* Anyone on 8-16 GB of RAM who needs every MB they can get\n* Anyone who wants to manage MCP servers visually instead of editing JSON files\n\nMIT licensed, zero dependencies beyond Node.js 18+.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/Soflution1/mcp-on-demand](https://github.com/Soflution1/mcp-on-demand) npm: [u/soflution/mcp-on-demand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@soflution/mcp-on-demand)\n\nHappy to answer questions or take feature requests.",

I'd be mid-workflow, the agent gets stuck because it's missing a tool, and I'd have to stop everything, go write it manually, restart, and pick up where I left off. Got annoying fast.\n\nI ended up building something to fix that for myself. The agent can now just... write the tool it needs on the spot. Mid-conversation. Saves it, uses it, and it's there permanently from that point on. Next time it needs the same thing it just calls it like it was always there.\n\nThe thing I was most paranoid about was security — letting an agent write and execute arbitrary code is sketchy if you don't think it through. So everything runs sandboxed with no access to anything sensitive unless I explicitly approve it. And I can get really specific, like \"this tool can only talk to this one domain, nothing else.\"\n\nI also added a marketplace connected to GitHub so you can publish tools and share them with others, or install tools someone else already built. Your GitHub identity handles ownership so nobody can mess with what you published.\n\nBeen using it daily for a few days now in my own projects and it's changed how I think about building agent workflows. Instead of planning tools upfront I just let the agent figure out what it needs.\n\nRepo is open if anyone wants to check it out or poke around: [https://github.com/ageborn-dev/architect-mcp-server](https://github.com/ageborn-dev/architect-mcp-server)",

      "text": "Hey all, just sharing some findings about building a handful of servers professionally. A handful may not seem like a lot (it's not) but I'll say it's because of the time spent decomposing the problem into something tangible ie. helping the customer know what they even want. That is a whole 'nother post though, happy to rant in comments anyway...  \n\n\nThis post is about my recent improvements in developing MCP servers, specifically around architecture.  \n  \nI’ve started treating an MCP server as an end product designed for an LLM to interface with, in the same way a UI is the product surface a human interfaces with. In the past, I built MCP servers by exposing a set of tools that closely mirrored the API I was wrapping. The result was “API-shaped” tooling: lots of small, low-level calls that map neatly to endpoints. Now, the LLM has to figure out the right sequence of calls, understand vendor-specific mechanics, and stitch together multiple responses into something usable. It’s a bottom-up design: start from the API and bubble up.  \n  \nA better approach is to invert this into a top-down, capability-driven design. Start from the outcomes you want the model to achieve, then design tools around those capabilities rather than around CRUD primitives. For example, consider an MCP server for Linear or Jira. Instead of API-shaped tools like get\\_issue, get\\_ticket, get\\_comments, get\\_links, or get\\_attachments, you can provide a capability tool like get\\_ticket\\_context. That tool returns the context the model actually needs in one call e.g., a short summary, recent activity, key comments, relevant links, and attachments.   \n  \nAs with most things, there’s a balance to strike between these approaches but adopting this mental model has helped me get much closer to the right place.\n\nLots of inspiration here comes from Jeremiah Lowin - creator of FastMCP!",

          "text": "100% agree on the capability-driven approach. I went through the same evolution - started by mirroring REST endpoints 1:1, ended up with way too many tools and the model constantly picking the wrong one. Collapsing related calls into a single \"get me what I need\" tool cut my error rate in half.\n\nOne thing I'd add: putting usage examples directly in the tool description helps a lot more than a detailed JSON schema. Models respond better to \"here's how you'd call this\" than \"here are all 15 optional params.\"",

      "text": "I built an MCP server for Microsoft Word that goes beyond the usual python-docx approach. The problem with file-based Word manipulation is that it eats a ton of LLM context (the model has to parse XML or deal with complex object structures), can't touch files that are open in Word, and formatting breaks in unpredictable ways.\n\nMy server has two modes:\n\n**File-based tools (78 tools, cross-platform)** — python-docx + direct OOXML manipulation for tracked changes, comments, hyperlinks, and footnotes. These work on any platform but require the file to be closed.\n\n**COM live tools (27 tools, Windows only)** — pywin32 COM automation that controls Word directly while the document is open. This is the main workflow. The LLM calls methods on Word's object model (Range, Paragraph, Selection) instead of parsing XML, which keeps context usage minimal.\n\nSome of the live tools:\n\n* `word_live_format_text` — font, size, bold, italic, highlight, alignment, style changes via character offsets\n* `word_live_insert_text` / `word_live_delete_text` — with optional `track_changes` flag for proper revisions with author/timestamp\n* `word_live_get_page_text(page, end_page)` — reads specific pages and returns `char_start`/`char_end` offsets so the LLM can chain into edit tools without reading the whole document\n* `word_live_add_comment` — anchored to specific text ranges via character offset or paragraph index\n* `word_live_setup_heading_numbering` — applies multilevel list numbering linked to Heading styles, customizes the styles, and optionally strips manual number prefixes\n* `word_live_get_paragraph_format` — diagnostic dump of font, spacing, alignment, `keep_with_next`, list info per paragraph\n\n**Undo system:** All 27 destructive live tools are wrapped with Word's `UndoRecord`. Each tool call = one named entry in Word's undo stack (\"MCP: Format Text\", \"MCP: Insert Text\"). There's also a `word_live_undo(times=N)` tool so the LLM can undo its own work, and `word_live_get_undo_history()` to inspect the stack.\n\n**Architecture:**\n\n* FastMCP with stdio transport (also supports streamable-http and SSE)\n* COM connection via `win32com.client.GetActiveObject(\"Word.Application\")` — Word must be running\n* Document lookup by basename across all open documents\n* `undo_record` context manager wraps mutations, degrades gracefully on Word 2007\n* OOXML tools (tracked changes, comments, hyperlinks) use lxml with proper namespace handling and multi-run text spanning\n\n**Config:** Author name and initials configurable via `MCP_AUTHOR` / `MCP_AUTHOR_INITIALS` env vars.\n\nI also built a similar COM MCP server for PowerPoint (26 live tools) and use a Go-based Excel MCP server.\n\nRepo: [word-mcp-live](https://github.com/ykarapazar/word-mcp-live)\n\nWanted to share in case anyone's building MCP servers for non-coding workflows.",
