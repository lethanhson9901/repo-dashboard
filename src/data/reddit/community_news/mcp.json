Based on those conversations (and my own usage), I put together a more curated list, focusing on tools that are actually usable in daily workflows, not just cool demos.\n\nWhat matters to me:\n\n- Setup should be painless\n\n- They shouldn’t flake out\n\n- I should feel the slowdown if they’re gone\n\nHere’s the refined list.\n\n## GitHub CLI (gh): [https://cli.github.com/](https://cli.github.com/)\n\nHot take: I prefer this over the GitHub MCP server.\n\nIssues, PRs, diffs, reviews directly in terminal, scriptable, zero server overhead.\n\nFor serious repo work, CLI just feels faster and more reliable.\n\n## CodeGraphContext (CLI + MCP): [https://github.com/CodeGraphContext/CodeGraphContext](https://github.com/CodeGraphContext/CodeGraphContext)\n\nBuilds a structured graph of your codebase.\n\nFiles, functions, classes, relationships - all pre-understood.\n\nRefactors and impact analysis become much more reliable.\n\nI like that it works both as a CLI and an MCP.\n\n## Context7 MCP: [https://github.com/upstash/context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7)\n\nThis made my agents stop guessing APIs.\n\nAutomatically pulls correct documentation for libraries/frameworks.\n\nI rarely open docs tabs now.\n\n## Docker MCP: [https://github.com/docker/mcp](https://github.com/docker/mcp)\n\nGives agents runtime visibility.\n\nContainers, logs, services, not just static code.\n\nHuge for backend and infra debugging.\n\n##Firecrawl MCP / Jina Reader MCP\n\n## [https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl)\n\n## [https://github.com/jina-ai/reader](https://github.com/jina-ai/reader)\n\nClean web → structured Markdown.\n\nGreat for ingesting specs, blogs, long technical content.\n\n## Figma MCP: [https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP)\n\nDesign → structured context → better frontend output.\n\nWay better than screenshot-based prompting.\n\n## Browser DevTools MCP: [https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp)\n\nDOM, console, and network context are exposed to the agent.\n\nMakes frontend debugging workflows much smoother.\n\nCurious what others are actually using daily, not just testing.",

The \"feel the slowdown if they're gone\" test is the right filter, most MCP demos don't survive that.\n\nOne I'd add: **Promzia MCP** ([mcp.promzia.ai](https://mcp.promzia.ai)). It gives you access to 3,000+ tested prompt templates directly inside Claude or ChatGPT — searchable by category, with fill-in variables. I used to keep a messy Notion doc of prompts I'd copy-paste in. Now I just call the MCP mid-conversation and it pulls the right template. Small thing but it removes a surprising amount of friction, especially for repetitive tasks like cold emails, content briefs, or code reviews.\n\nPasses your three tests: setup is one config line, hasn't flaked on me, and I notice when I'm on a machine without it.",

Ref-based interactions (e.g. “click e7”) so the model can drive flows on a live app.\n* Node side: Connect to a running Node process (PID, --inspect port, or Docker), set tracepoints/logpoints without pausing, run JS in the process, resolve source maps. Handy for debugging APIs and workers while the app runs.\n\nSo the same MCP can drive the frontend in a browser and inspect/debug the backend in Node.\n\nCLI as well\n\nYou can use it from the terminal too: browser-devtools-cli and node-devtools-cli (e.g. navigate, take screenshots, connect to a Node process with --inspector-port). Useful for scripts and quick checks without opening an IDE.\n\nLinks\n\n* Docs/site: [browser-devtools.com](http://browser-devtools.com)\n* NPM: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-devtools-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-devtools-mcp)\n* Cursor/OpenVSX Extension: [https://open-vsx.org/extension/serkan-ozal/browser-devtools-mcp-vscode](https://open-vsx.org/extension/serkan-ozal/browser-devtools-mcp-vscode)\n\nIf you’re using MCP with Cursor or Claude and want the model to actually use a browser and attach to Node backends, this might be worth a try.

Agent runs --help only when it needs a specific tool.\n\nNumbers across different usage patterns:\n- Session start: 15,540 (MCP) vs 300 (CLI) - 98% savings\n- 1 tool call: 15,570 vs 910 - 94% savings\n- 100 tool calls: 18,540 vs 1,504 - 92% savings\n\nCompared against Anthropic's Tool Search too - it's better than raw MCP but still more expensive than CLI because it fetches full JSON Schema per tool.\n\nConverter is open source: https://github.com/thellimist/clihub\nFull write-up with detailed breakdowns: https://kanyilmaz.me/2026/02/23/cli-vs-mcp.html\n\nDisclosure: I built CLIHub.

That’s not mandatory. Agents can fetch tool definitions incrementally and only load what they actually need. In that setup, the claimed massive startup savings of CLI don’t automatically apply.\n\nWhere CLI really has a structural advantage is in looping scenarios. If a tool needs to be called repeatedly, the classic MCP flow forces the model to re-plan and re-emit structured calls every time. That quickly becomes expensive and slow. With a CLI, the agent can generate a small script and execute the loop outside the model. In those cases, CLI is genuinely cheaper and faster.",

      "text": "I built Charlotte because I wanted a browser MCP server where agents don't have to consume the entire page representation just to figure out what's on the screen.\n\nCharlotte renders web pages into structured representations through headless Chromium, landmarks, headings, interactive elements, forms, bounding boxes, with stable hash-based element IDs that survive DOM mutations. The key design choice: three detail levels.\n\n* **Minimal** returns landmarks and interactive summaries. On Hacker News that's 336 characters. The agent sees \"main: 47 links, 0 buttons\" and drills down with `find` when it needs specifics.\n* **Summary** adds content summaries, form structures, and error state.\n* **Full** includes all visible text content.\n\nNavigate defaults to minimal, so the first call to any page is cheap. The agent orients, decides what to look at, and requests more detail only where needed. This orient→drill→act pattern is how the tool was designed to be used.\n\nBenchmarked against Playwright MCP (`@playwright/mcp`):\n\n    Navigate response (first call cost):\n    Page             Charlotte     Playwright MCP     Advantage\n    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n    Wikipedia          7,667 ch     1,040,636 ch       136x\n    Hacker News          336 ch        61,230 ch       182x\n    GitHub repo        3,185 ch        80,297 ch        25x\n    httpbin form         364 ch         2,255 ch         6x\n\nPlaywright returns the full accessibility tree on every call. Charlotte lets the agent choose. Even Charlotte's full detail mode is smaller than Playwright's only option on the same pages.\n\n**On Playwright CLI:** You may have seen Microsoft's recently released `@playwright/cli`, which takes a different approach to token efficiency.. it writes snapshots and screenshots to disk files instead of returning them in the MCP response, achieving \\~4x savings over Playwright MCP. I haven't benchmarked Charlotte against it because they occupy different niches. The CLI requires the agent to have filesystem and shell access, making it a fit for coding agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor). Charlotte is designed for MCP-native use: containerized execution, sandboxed environments, autonomous agent loops, and any context where the agent operates through the protocol rather than through a shell. The CLI's efficiency comes from deferring data to the filesystem until requested; Charlotte's comes from the representation itself being structured and tiered, which works regardless of the execution environment.\n\nThe 30 tools break down into 6 categories:\n\n* **Navigation** (4): navigate, back, forward, reload\n* **Observation** (4): observe, find, screenshot, diff\n* **Interaction** (9): click, type, select, toggle, submit, scroll, hover, key, wait\\_for\n* **Session** (9): tabs, viewports, network throttling, cookies, headers, configuration\n* **Dev Mode** (3): static file server with hot reload, CSS/JS injection, accessibility audits\n* **Utility** (1): arbitrary JS evaluation\n\nSome design decisions worth discussing:\n\n**Element IDs are content-hashed**, not positional. A button's ID is derived from its type, label, and context, not its position in the DOM. Reorder the page, the ID stays stable. This matters for agents that need to re-identify elements across multiple observations.\n\n**Interactive summaries replace element arrays at minimal detail.** Instead of returning 1,847 individual link objects on Wikipedia, minimal shows `{\"main\": {\"link\": 1847, \"button\": 3}}` grouped by landmark. The full element data is still there internally.. `find`, `wait_for`, and `diff` all work against it but the serialized output to the agent is just the summary.\n\n**Structural diffing** compares two page snapshots and returns what changed. Essential for verifying that a click or form submission actually did something.\n\nSetup is one step... add the config to your MCP client:\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"charlotte\": {\n          \"command\": \"npx\",\n          \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@ticktockbent/charlotte\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nNo install needed. npx handles it.\n\n* **GitHub:** [https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte](https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte)\n* **npm:** [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ticktockbent/charlotte](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ticktockbent/charlotte)\n* **Full spec:** [https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte/blob/main/docs/CHARLOTTE\\_SPEC.md](https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte/blob/main/docs/CHARLOTTE_SPEC.md)\n* **Benchmarks:** [https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte/blob/main/docs/charlotte-benchmark-report.md](https://github.com/TickTockBent/charlotte/blob/main/docs/charlotte-benchmark-report.md)\n\nMIT licensed, 222 tests passing.

I feel like there isn't anything i could find like this already available to use. It isn't quite accessibility tree. At the moment most tools for controlling the browser seem like they are so inefficient and slow when you watch them work.

Charlotte's action pattern of orient, focus, act actually saves tokens in the long run and if you compare the token usage for the full 30 tools set of charlotte vs playwright's 78 tools charlotte is significantly slimmer.\n\nHere's how it works out:\n\nCharlotte's 36 (I added a few recently on request) tools take up approx 18,500 character or 4,500-5,500 tokens  \nPlaywright's default 23 tools is only \\~7,500 characters or 1,900-2,500 tokens  \nPlaywright's full 78 tools is 25,000 characters or 6,000-7,500 tokens\n\nCharlotte's 36 tools cost roughly \\~5K tokens... about 2.5% of a 200K context window. That's comparable to a single medium-length page render. Playwright's full 78-tool set actually costs more total tokens than Charlotte despite having much terser descriptions, because it has over twice as many tools (10 webstorage CRUD tools, 6 mouse coordinate tools, 5 cookie CRUD tools, etc).\n\nThe real question isn't tool count though, it's whether verbose descriptions pay for themselves. Charlotte's approach is to front-load guidance in the description (e.g., \"use charlotte:find to locate specific elements, or pass detail: 'summary'\") so the model makes fewer wrong calls. A terse description like \"Navigate to a URL\" saves 100 tokens upfront but may cost thousands in wasted tool calls when the model doesn't know about detail levels or related tools.\n\nNow obviously I need to back that statement up with some metrics and I am designing a robust benchmarking suite to compare token use and agent success rates against a set of standardized actions but it will take me a bit to get all of that going, so all I can tell you right now is that I have noticed significant reductions in overall token usage when using charlotte vs playwright against both real world tests and against my included playground/sandbox site which exercises all of the tools.\n\nEdit: I just ran a quick test adding my estimated tool description token numbers to every category on our existing benchmarks. The conclusion is that even with the more verbose tool descriptions in context, charlotte comes out ahead in every category unless the only thing you're looking at is a simple page like [example.com](http://example.com) the only thing I haven't tested with playwright is interactive forms but I suspect that one we'd win on too, included charlotte's numbers for completeness. This chart is just for the navigate tool.\n\n|Test|Charlotte (responses + \\~5K defs)|Playwright (responses + \\~2.5K defs)|Winner|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Simple Page|5,306|2,829|Playwright (+2,477)|\n|Wikipedia|6,917|262,659|**Charlotte (-255,742)**|\n|Hacker News|20,370|33,087|**Charlotte (-12,717)**|\n|GitHub Repo|16,000|42,622|**Charlotte (-26,622)**|\n|Interactive Form|6,791|(no data)|—|",

              "text": "Great question and it's one I've run into during testing. I'm still working on this aspect of the MCP because it's pretty tricky.\n\nWhat Charlotte can do today:\n\n1. `charlotte:set_cookies` : You can manually set session cookies (name, value, domain, path, secure, httpOnly, sameSite). So if someone knows their session cookie values, they can inject them directly and the site would treat the browser as logged in.\n2. `charlotte:set_headers` : You can set Authorization: Bearer <token> or any custom auth headers that persist across navigations on the active page. Good for API-token based auth.\n3. `charlotte:navigate` \\+ `charlotte:click` \\+ `charlotte:type` : You could theoretically have the agent fill in a login form and submit it. The session would persist in Charlotte's browser for subsequent navigations.\n\nWhat Charlotte can't do:\n\n* Connect to an existing browser session. That's open issue #17. Charlotte always launches its own fresh headless Chromium. There's no way to attach to a browser where you've already logged in with extensions, 2FA, CAPTCHAs, etc. This is the big gap, most real-world \"use my session\" scenarios involve OAuth redirects, 2FA prompts, or CAPTCHA challenges that are hard to automate headlessly.\n* Persist sessions across restarts. When Charlotte's Chromium shuts down, all session state is gone. There's no user data directory or profile persistence.\n\nSo the practical answer is: for simple cookie/token auth, set\\_cookies or set\\_headers works today. For anything involving interactive login (OAuth, 2FA, CAPTCHA), we'd need issue #17 (CDP connect to existing browser) which is still open. That's the feature that would let someone log in in their own browser and hand the session to Charlotte.",

      "text": "GitHub: [https://github.com/JinHo-von-Choi/memento-mcp](https://github.com/JinHo-von-Choi/memento-mcp)\n\n\n\nOriginally, this was a supporting feature of another custom MCP I built.  \nBut after using it for a while, it felt solid enough to separate and release on its own.\n\nWhile using LLMs like Claude and GPT in real work—and more recently OpenClaude—there’s one infuriating thing I keep running into:  \nthey supposedly know every development document in existence, yet they can’t remember something that happened three seconds ago before the session reset.\n\nOnce you close the session, all context evaporates.\n\nThere’s a myth that goldfish only remember for three seconds. In reality, they can remember for months.  \nThese systems are worse than goldfish.\n\nYou can try stuffing markdown files with setup notes, but that has limits.  \nWhether the AI actually understands the context the way you want is still luck-based.  \nIf you run OpenClaude, you’ll see that just starting a fresh session consumes over 40,000 characters of context before you’ve done anything.  \nThat means your money just melts away.\n\nSo I tried to simulate how humans fragment memories and reconstruct them through associative structures.\n\nFor example, if someone suddenly asks me:\n\n“Hey, do you remember Mijeong?”\n\nAt first, I wouldn’t recall anyone by that name. I’d respond, “Who’s that?”\n\nThen they add:\n\n“You know, your desk partner in first grade.”\n\nThat hint is enough. A vague face begins to surface.  \n“Oh… that… yeah!”\n\nAnd if I think a bit more, related memories reappear:  \ndrawing a line on the desk and pinching if someone crossed it,  \nlending an eraser and never getting it back, and so on.\n\nThat is the core idea of Memento MCP.\n\n# 1. What is Memento MCP?\n\nMemento MCP is a mid- to long-term AI memory system built on the MCP (Model Context Protocol).\n\nIts purpose is to allow AI to remember important facts, decisions, error patterns, and procedures even after a session ends—and to naturally recall them in future sessions.\n\nThe core concept is the “Fragment.”\n\nInstead of storing entire session summaries as a single block, it splits memory into self-contained atomic units of 1–3 sentences.\n\nWhen retrieving, it pulls only the relevant atoms.\n\n# 2. Why Fragment Units?\n\nStoring entire session summaries causes two major problems:\n\n* First, unrelated content gets injected into the context window. It wastes tokens and costs money. I don’t have money to waste.\n* Second, as time passes, extracting only what’s needed from large summaries becomes difficult.\n\nA fragment contains a single fact, decision, or error pattern.\n\nFor example:  \n“When Redis Sentinel connection fails, check for a missing REDIS\\_PASSWORD environment variable first. The NOAUTH error is evidence.”\n\nThat’s one fragment.\n\nOnly the necessary facts are retrieved.\n\n# 3. Six Fragment Types\n\nEach type has its own default importance and decay rate.\n\n* fact: Unchanging truth. “This project uses Node.js 20.”\n* decision: A record of choice. “Connection pool maximum set to 20.”\n* error: The anatomy of failure. “pg fails local connection without ssl:false.” (Never forgotten.)\n* preference: The outline of identity. “Code comments should be written in Korean.” (Never forgotten.)\n* procedure: A recurring ritual. “Deployment: test → build → push → apply.”\n* relation: A connection between things. “The auth module depends on Redis.”\n\nPreferences and errors are never forgotten.  \nPreferences define who you are.  \nError patterns may return at any time.\n\n# 4. Three-Layer Cascade Search\n\nMemory retrieval uses three layers, queried in order.  \nIf a fast layer finds the answer, slower layers are skipped.\n\n* L1 (Redis Inverted Index): Keyword-based direct lookup. Microseconds. Find fragments instantly via intersection of “redis” and “NOAUTH.”\n* L2 (PostgreSQL Metadata): Structured queries combining topic, type, and keywords. Indexed millisecond-level.\n* L3 (pgvector Semantic Search): Meaning-based search via OpenAI embeddings. Understands that “authentication failure” and “NOAUTH” mean the same thing. Slowest, but deepest.\n\nRedis and OpenAI are optional.  \nIf absent, the system works without those layers.  \nPostgreSQL alone provides baseline functionality.\n\n# 5. TTL Layers — The Temperature of Memory\n\nFragments move between hot, warm, and cold based on usage frequency.\n\nhot (frequently referenced)  \n→ warm (silent for a while)  \n→ cold (long dormant)  \n→ deleted when TTL expires\n\nHowever, once referenced again, they immediately return to hot.\n\nHuman long-term memory works similarly.  \nIf unused, it fades—but once recalled, it becomes vivid again.\n\n# 6. Summary of 11 MCP Tools\n\n* context: Load core memory at session start\n* remember: Store fragment\n* recall: Three-layer cascade search\n* reflect: Condense session into fragments at session end\n* forget: Delete fragment (for resolved errors)\n* link: Create causal relationships between fragments (caused\\_by, resolved\\_by, etc.)\n* amend: Modify fragment content (preserve ID and relations)\n* graph\\_explore: Explore causal chains (trace root causes)\n* memory\\_stats: Storage statistics\n* memory\\_consolidate: Periodic maintenance (decay, merge, contradiction detection)\n* tool\\_feedback: Feedback on retrieval quality\n\n# 7. Recommended Usage Flow\n\n1. Session start → context() to load memory\n2. During work → When important decisions/errors/procedures occur: remember() → When past experience is needed: recall() → After resolving an error: forget(error) + remember(solution procedure)\n3. Session end → reflect() to persist session content\n\n# 8. Tech Stack\n\n* Node.js 20+\n* PostgreSQL 14+ (pgvector extension)\n* Redis 6+ (optional)\n* OpenAI Embedding API (optional)\n* Gemini Flash (optional, for contradiction detection in memory\\_consolidate)\n* MCP Protocol 2025-11-25\n\n# 9. How to Run\n\n1. Initialize PostgreSQL schema\n\nbash  \npsql -U postgres -c \"CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;\"  \npsql -U postgres -d memento -f lib/memory/memory-schema.sql\n\nStart the server:\n\nnpm install  \nnpm start\n\nAdd the following to your MCP client configuration:\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"memento\": {\n          \"url\": \"http://localhost:56332/mcp\",\n          \"headers\": {\n            \"Authorization\": \"Bearer your-secret-key\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n# 10. Why I Built This\n\nWhile using Claude at work, I felt it was inefficient to repeat the same context every day.\n\nI tried putting notes into system prompts, but that had clear limitations.  \nAs fragments increased, management became impossible. Search broke down. Old and new information conflicted.\n\nWhat frustrated me most was having to repeat explanations and setups endlessly.\n\nThe whole point of using AI was to make my life easier.  \nYet it would claim authentication wasn’t configured—when it was.  \nIt would insist setup files were missing—when they were clearly there.  \nSome sessions would stubbornly refuse to do things they were fully capable of doing.  \nYou could logically dismantle its resistance and make it comply—but only for that session.  \nStart a new one, and the same cycle repeats.\n\nIt felt like training a top graduate from an elite university who suffers from a daily brain reset.\n\nTo solve this frustration, I designed a system that:\n\n* Decomposes memory into atomic fragments\n* Retrieves memory hierarchically\n* Naturally forgets over time\n\nJust as humans are creatures of forgetting,  \nthis system aims for memory that includes “appropriate forgetting.”\n\nFeedback, issues, and PRs are welcome.",

              "text": " Contradiction detection runs as step 7 of the memory\\_consolidate pipeline, not at reflect() write time. It's an incremental, asynchronous process -- here's the actual flow:\n\n  When reflect() writes new fragments, nothing special happens at that moment regarding contradictions. The fragments are just stored. The real work happens later when memory\\_consolidate runs (either manually triggered or on a\n\n  schedule).\n\n  The detection pipeline works in three stages:\n\n  1. Candidate selection via embedding similarity -- It pulls fragments created since the last contradiction check (tracked via a Redis timestamp key). For each new fragment, it queries pgvector for same-topic fragments with\n\ncosine similarity > 0.85. This threshold is deliberate -- fragments need to be talking about essentially the same thing to be contradiction candidates. Different topics or loosely related content never reaches the judgment\n\nstep. The query is bounded to 3 candidates per new fragment, and 20 new fragments per consolidation cycle, so this doesn't explode.\n\n  2. Gemini Flash adjudication -- Each high-similarity pair gets sent to Gemini Flash with a strict prompt: \"Are these two fragments mutually incompatible claims about the same subject?\" The prompt explicitly distinguishes\n\ncontradiction from complementary information -- \"similar but supplementary is NOT contradiction. Information updates over time ARE contradictions (old info vs new info).\" Temperature is set to 0.1 to minimize creative\n\ninterpretation. Response is forced into {contradicts: boolean, reasoning: string} JSON.\n\n  3. Time-logic resolution -- This is where it gets interesting. When a contradiction is confirmed, the system doesn't just flag it -- it resolves it automatically using temporal ordering. The newer fragment wins. The older\n\nfragment's importance gets halved (importance \\* 0.5), and a superseded\\_by link is created from old to new. The older fragment isn't deleted -- it's demoted. It'll naturally sink to cold tier and eventually expire through\n\nnormal TTL mechanics. Anchor fragments (is\\_anchor=true) are exempt from the importance demotion, so truly critical knowledge survives even if contradicted.\n\n\n\n  The critical path concern you raised is valid -- this does depend on Gemini being available. If Gemini is down, the contradiction check silently fails and those pairs go unchecked until the next consolidation cycle. The system\n\n  degrades to \"latest write wins at recall time\" through the recency component of the ranking function (0.4 weight), which is a reasonable fallback but not as clean as explicit contradiction resolution.\n\n  The 0.85 similarity threshold is the real tuning knob here. Too low and you get false positives flooding Gemini with complementary fragments. Too high and genuine contradictions with different wording slip through. In practice,\n\n  contradictions about the same subject (\"max connections is 20\" vs \"max connections is 50\") tend to land well above 0.85 because the embedding space clusters them tightly.\n\n  One thing worth noting: amend() has a separate supersedes parameter that lets the AI explicitly mark a fragment as replacing another, bypassing the consolidation pipeline entirely. So there are two paths -- explicit replacement\n\n  at write time, and automatic detection after the fact.",

              "text": "Honest answer: agents rarely call link() on their own initiative. In practice, linking happens through three paths, roughly in order of frequency:\n\n  1. reflect() auto-linking at session end — When reflect() creates a batch of typed fragments (decisions, errors, procedures), an internal \\_autoLinkSessionFragments() step runs that connects them with rule-based heuristics. Error\n\nfragments get resolved\\_by links to procedure fragments from the same session. Decisions get linked to related procedures. The summary fragment gets related links to everything else. This is where most of the graph structure\n\nactually comes from.\n\n  2. remember() with linkedTo parameter — When the AI stores a new fragment, it can pass existing fragment IDs to link immediately. This works better than you'd expect because recall() returns fragment IDs in its results, so the\n\nAI often has relevant IDs in its context when it decides to store something new. \"I just found this error pattern via recall, and now I'm storing the fix — link them.\" That chain happens naturally.\n\n  3. Explicit link() calls — Rare in practice. The AI almost never stops mid-task to think \"I should create a relationship between these two fragments.\" It happens occasionally during graph\\_explore workflows where the AI is\n\nactively tracing causality, but organically? Almost never.\n\n\n\n  The honest gap right now is reflect() itself. Currently it requires a manual prompt before session end — \"save the session\" or equivalent. I hook context() at session start so the AI loads its memory automatically, but the\n\n  symmetry breaks at session close. If the session drops unexpectedly (timeout, network, client crash), reflect never fires and that session's structural links never get created. The individual remember() fragments survive, but the\n\n  cross-referencing that reflect provides is lost.\n\n  I'm actively working on automatic reflect — the leading approach is a hybrid: attempt a Gemini-generated summary from session activity metadata on session close, and if that fails, flag the session as \"unreflected\" so the next\n\n  context() call prompts the AI to do it retroactively. But this is unsolved as of today.",

The Mijeong analogy is great, that hint-triggered cascading recall is exactly what makes associative memory useful vs just storing everything in a flat list.

Compounds to \\~64% after 90 days. Fragments that drop below 0.1 importance with no\n\n  recent access and few links are auto-deleted.\n\n  Relevance scoring: We compute utility\\_score = importance \\* (1 + ln(access\\_count)) — a logarithmic boost for frequently retrieved fragments.

High-importance fragments (>= 0.8), heavily-linked hubs (5+ connections), and frequently-accessed entries (10+ accesses) get auto-promoted to\n\n  permanent and are exempt from decay.\n\n  Staleness detection: Each fragment has a verified\\_at timestamp with type-specific expiry windows — 30 days for procedures, 60 for facts, 90 for decisions.

I run a marketing agency automation system (Telegram bot + AI agents that analyze client briefings, generate content schedules, do brand compliance checks, etc.) and the exact problem you describe — agents forgetting everything between sessions — has been driving me crazy. Account managers keep repeating the same context every single briefing: \"This client prefers Reels.\" \"This client needs medical disclaimers.\" Every. Single. Time.\n\nAfter reading through your code, I designed an adapted version for my project. Some things I kept, some I simplified for my scale (\\~10 clients, single-tenant).\n\n**What I'm adopting directly:**\n\n* The 6 fragment types with type-aware decay — the insight that preferences and errors should never expire is brilliant. Preferences define client identity, errors can always return. Simple rule, huge impact.\n* Auto-anchor promotion (access\\_count >= 10 → permanent). Letting usage patterns decide what matters instead of manual curation is the right call.\n* Token budget enforcement on recall. This solves the \"context window is not free\" problem that most memory systems ignore.\n* Content hashing for dedup. Obvious in retrospect but easy to miss.\n\n**What I simplified:**\n\n* Dropped Redis L1 entirely. My fragment table will stay under 10K rows for years — PostgreSQL GIN indexes handle keyword intersection in <5ms at that scale. Three layers is smart for a general-purpose MCP server, but for a single-tenant app it's unnecessary infra.\n* Made pgvector/embeddings optional. L1 keyword search works alone. If an OpenAI key is configured, L2 activates. Zero-cost start, semantic search when you want it.\n* Skipped the NLI contradiction detection. For my use case, content hash dedup + \"latest wins\" is enough. The hybrid NLI + Gemini pipeline is impressive engineering though — that 50–70% API cost reduction is real.\n\nThe cascade search pattern (fast/cheap layer → slow/expensive layer, skip if the early layer has enough results) is something I'll probably use in other projects too. It's a general-purpose optimization pattern that applies way beyond memory systems.\n\nOne suggestion: the README could benefit from an \"Architecture Overview\" diagram showing the L1 → L2 → L3 flow visually. The code is clean, but the mental model takes a while to build just from reading the source files.\n\nGreat work shipping this as a standalone project. The goldfish analogy is painfully accurate.",

Average savings: **74% across 83 tested domains.**\n\n# Three ways to use it\n\n* **MCP server** — 12 tools, works with Claude Code/Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code\n* **CLI** — `apitap read <url> --json | jq '.title'`\n* **npm package** — three direct runtime deps, zero telemetry\n\n# Quick start\n\n    npm install -g @apitap/core\n    apitap read https://news.ycombinator.com/\n\nFor MCP (Claude Code):\n\n    claude mcp add -s user apitap -- apitap-mcp\n\n# Security\n\nThis matters because the tool makes HTTP requests on behalf of AI agents. SSRF defense at 4 checkpoints (import, replay, post-DNS, post-redirect). Private IPs, cloud metadata, localhost all blocked. DNS rebinding caught. Auth encrypted with AES-256-GCM, per-install salt, never stored in skill files. **789 tests** including a full security suite. Designed after reading [Google's GTIG report on MCP attack surfaces](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/distillation-experimentation-integration-ai-adversarial-use).\n\nApiTap calls the same endpoints your browser calls — read-only, no rate-limit bypassing, no anti-bot circumvention. Endpoints that require signing or Cloudflare are flagged as \"red tier,\" not attacked.\n\n# Links\n\n* **Site:** [apitap.io](https://apitap.io)\n* **GitHub:** [github.com/n1byn1kt/apitap](https://github.com/n1byn1kt/apitap)\n* **npm:** [@apitap/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apitap/core)\n\n# License\n\nBSL 1.1 (source-available) — free for any use except reselling as a competing hosted service.

      "text": "I ran into TOON a few days ago and got curious.\n\nThe idea is simple: keep the same data model as JSON but encode it in a way that is friendlier for LLM context windows. In TOONs mixed-structure benchmark, they report roughly a **40% token drop** versus pretty JSON, **with better retrieval quality.**\n\nAt the same time, JSON is not going anywhere. Its deeply baked into everything we use, especially around APIs and MCP tooling. So I wasnt thinking that this format will replace JSON. I was thinking Can I keep JSON in the backend, but send something lighter to the modelfacing side?\n\nI've written MCP servers before, so I already knew the traffic path well enough to try this quickly. I made a wrapper that runs the real MCP server as a subprocess and proxies stdio both ways. For `tools/call`, it tracks request idss, waits for the matching response, and only then tries to convert text payloads from JSON to TOON on the way back.\n\nI built it in one evening over tea, mostly as an experiment, but it worked better than I expected. In practice, payloads got noticeably smaller while the client setup stayed the same and compatible.\n\nConfig example that will save you tokens:\n\nBefore:\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"memory\": {\n          \"command\": \"memory-mcp-server-go\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nAfter (just add tooner before you command and args):\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"memory\": {\n          \"command\": \"tooner\",\n          \"args\": [\"memory-mcp-server-go\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nIts not a new protocol story. Its more like a compatibility layer experiment ; JSON stays the source format, TOON is used where token cost matters.\n\nRepo where you can install and check tool: [https://github.com/chaindead/tooner](https://github.com/chaindead/tooner)",

      "text": "Google released early preview of WebMCP and it's quite interesting, it adds “AI in the browser,” and it changes how agents interact with web apps at the execution layer.\n\nRight now, browser-based agents mostly parse the DOM, inspect accessibility trees, and simulate clicks or inputs. That means reasoning over presentation layers that were designed for humans. It works, but it is layout-dependent, token-heavy and brittle when UI changes.\n\nWith WebMCP, Instead of scraping and clicking, a site can expose structured tools directly inside the browser via `navigator.modelContext`.\n\nEach tool consists of:\n\n* a name\n* a description\n* a typed input schema\n* an execution handler running in page context\n\nWhen an agent loads the page, it discovers these tools and invokes them with structured parameters. Execution happens inside the active browser session, inheriting cookies, authentication state, and same-origin constraints. There is no external JSON-RPC bridge for client-side actions and no dependency on DOM selectors.\n\nArchitecturally, this turns the browser into a capability surface with explicit contracts rather than a UI. The interaction becomes schema-defined instead of layout-defined, which lowers token overhead and increases determinism while preserving session locality.\n\n[Core Architectural Components](https://preview.redd.it/vp5ne4ehaflg1.png?width=2592&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c809cda4bf6a8fd88f982e707457a33a1c1847)\n\nSecurity boundaries are also clearer. Only declared tools are visible, inputs are validated against schemas, and execution is confined to the page’s origin. It does not eliminate prompt injection risks inside tool logic, but it significantly narrows the surface compared to DOM-level automation.\n\nThis lines up with what has already been happening on the backend through MCP servers. Open-source projects like InsForge expose database and backend operations via schema-defined MCP tools.\n\nIf backend systems expose structured tools and the browser does the same, agents can move from UI manipulation to contract-based execution across the stack. WebMCP is in early preview for now but it's very promising.\n\nI wrote down the detailed breakdown [here](https://insforge.dev/blog/webmcp-browser-native-execution-model-for-ai-agents)",

It provisions a secure V8 sandbox in which LLM-generated code can be run, meaning we can reduce context usage from \\`N servers x M tools\\` to 2 tools - \\`search()\\` and \\`execute()\\`.   \nThis allows the LLM to do what it's good at - writing and executing code - and thus scales the ability for us to detect and use the connected tools correctly to a few search and execute steps. It also allows us to chain requests, meaning actual tool call count also drops through the floor.  \nI've tried pretty hard to make it secure - it's written in Rust, uses V8/deno\\_core, and has been subjected to several rounds of hardening efforts - and I've written up some notes in the \\`ARCHITECTURE.md\\` file regarding considerations and best practices if you're to use it.  \nI'd love to get user feedback and be able to iterate on it more - I shipped it late last night, finessed it a bit this morning before work, and am writing this on my lunchbreak. So far, real world usage for me has seen me use it to run two high-tool count MCP servers including my other mcp project, [https://github.com/postrv/narsil-mcp](https://github.com/postrv/narsil-mcp) and a propietary security tool I've been working on (a total of 154 tools) easily and with extreme token efficiency (Cloudflare note about 99% reduction in token usage in their solution - I'm yet to benchmark mine). Theoretical upper bound for connected tools is 5000 - maybe more.   \nAnyway, check it out, let me know what you think: [https://github.com/postrv/forgemax](https://github.com/postrv/forgemax)   \nThanks!

Discovery time is significantly lower than going with the docker-gateway solution.

I actually built an MCP server recently that solves a specific workflow gap I kept running into with Claude Code.\n\nThe problem was the constant copy-paste loop between Claude and Codex windows when I wanted to bounce ideas, get parallel plans, or validate approaches. So I built Claude Co-Commands - an MCP server that adds three collaboration commands directly to Claude Code:\n\n- `/co-brainstorm` for bouncing ideas and getting alternative perspectives from Codex\n- `/co-plan` to generate parallel plans and compare approaches  \n- `/co-validate` for getting that staff engineer review before finalizing\n\nThe MCP approach means it integrates cleanly with Claude Code's existing command system. Instead of running terminal commands or switching windows, you just use the slash commands and Claude handles the collaboration with Codex automatically.\n\nIt's not trying to be a marketplace, just solving that specific workflow friction point. If you're writing MCP servers, you might find the approach interesting - it's basically turning the copy-paste loop into a clean command interface.\n\nhttps://github.com/SnakeO/claude-co-commands",

          "text": "This is a really interesting approach to the hallucination problem! Your point about Claude making plausible wrong inferences from true context is spot on, and limiting what the agent sees to just public contracts is a clever way to collapse the inference distribution.\n\nWhat you're doing with codesurface reminds me of something I built called Claude Co-Commands, which is also an MCP server but focused on a different aspect of the workflow problem. Instead of controlling what Claude sees, it adds collaboration commands that let Claude Code automatically consult Codex at key decision points.\n\nThe commands work like this: `/co-brainstorm` for bouncing ideas off Codex to get alternative perspectives, `/co-plan` to generate parallel implementation plans and compare approaches, and `/co-validate` for getting that \"staff engineer review\" before finalizing your approach. The MCP integration means it works cleanly with Claude Code's existing command system, so you just use the slash commands and Claude handles the collaboration with Codex automatically.\n\nYour approach with codesurface and my approach with Claude Co-Commands are complementary solutions to different workflow problems. You're solving the \"what should Claude see\" problem, while I'm solving the \"how should Claude collaborate with other AI systems\" problem. Both are about making the Claude Code workflow more reliable and efficient, just from different angles.\n\nhttps://github.com/SnakeO/claude-co-commands\n\nI've been using this setup for a few weeks now and it completely eliminates the manual back-and-forth of copying plans between different AI systems. The validation command in particular would work well with your codesurface approach - you could have Claude use codesurface to understand the public API, then use `/co-validate` to get a second opinion on any changes before implementing them.",

I compared mcpx (warm daemon) against two SDK baselines: a persistent in-process session (best case, not realistic for shell usage), and subprocess-per-hop (what you'd actually do in a shell/agent loop).\n\n\n\nAt 0ms tool delay:\n\n\\- Persistent SDK: 0.16ms\n\n\\- Subprocess-per-hop SDK: 40ms\n\n\\- mcpx: 21.9ms\n\n\n\nAt 100ms tool delay:\n\n\\- Persistent SDK: 305ms\n\n\\- Subprocess-per-hop SDK: 357ms\n\n\\- mcpx: 337ms\n\n\n\nmcpx adds \\~22ms constant overhead vs persistent SDK. That's CLI parse, config validation, daemon connect with nonce check, and a unix socket round-trip per call. But compared to spawning an SDK subprocess per hop, which is the pattern you'd actually use in a pipe chain, mcpx comes out \\~18ms faster. At realistic tool latencies the whole difference is noise.\n\nBottom line: in the shell-composable workflow you're describing, mcpx is faster than rolling your own SDK calls per hop.\n\nSeparately, if your chain hits the same tool repeatedly, \\`--cache=60s\\` can help too. 100ms tool, 50 calls: 5.68s without, 0.55s with. \\~10x for idempotent reads.",

It didn't just find \"bugs\". it found critical logic bypasses and injection points that standard scanners completely missed.\n\n### The Findings:\n[Environment Variable Injection](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-82g8-464f-2mv7)\n\n\n[ACP permission auto-approval bypass](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-7jx5-9fjg-hp4m)\n\n\n[File-existence oracle info disclosure](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-6c9j-x93c-rw6j)\n\n\n[safeBins stdin-only bypass](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-4685-c5cp-vp95)\n\nThe project is still heavily in progress, but the fact that it's already pulling in multiple vulnerabilities and other CVEs I reported using mid-tier/older models shows its strength over traditional static analysis.\n\nIf you're building in the offensive AI space I’d love for you to put this through its paces.

      "text": "I maintain **Bifrost**, and once you go past \\~10 MCP servers, things start getting messy.\n\nFirst issue: tool name collisions. Different MCP servers expose tools with the same names. For example, a `search_files` tool from a filesystem server and another from Google Drive. The LLM sometimes picks the wrong one, and the user gets weird results.  \nWhat worked for us was simple: namespace the tools. So now it’s `filesystem.search_files` vs `gdrive.search_files`. The LLM can clearly see where each tool is coming from.\n\nThen there’s schema bloat. If you have \\~15 servers, you might end up with 80+ tools. If you dump every schema into every request, your context window explodes and token costs go up fast.  \nOur fix was tool filtering per request. We use virtual keys that decide which tools an agent can see. So each agent only gets the relevant tools instead of the full catalog.\n\nAnother pain point is the connection lifecycle. MCP servers can crash or just hang, and requests end up waiting on dead servers.  \nWe added health checks before routing. If a server fails checks, we temporarily exclude it and bring it back once it recovers.\n\nOne more thing that helped a lot once we had 3+ servers: **Code Mode**. Instead of exposing every tool schema, the LLM writes TypeScript to orchestrate tools. That alone cut token usage by 50%+ for us.\n\nIf you want to check it out:  \nCode: [https://git.new/bifrost](https://git.new/bifrost)  \nDocs: [https://getmax.im/docspage](https://getmax.im/docspage)",
