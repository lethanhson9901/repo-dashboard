      "text": "Hey r/mcp r/MCPservers r/rust r/programming r/opensource consider this my Christmas present to the opensource community.   \n  \nAs a security guy/dev chasing that \"one tool to rule them all\" vibe, I'm excited to share Narsil MCP - my open-source code intelligence server. Named after the legendary sword from LotR (Anduril was taken 😅).\n\n**What Is It?**\n\nA privacy-first, Rust-powered MCP server that supercharges AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, VS Code Copilot). Point it at your repos, get deep code insights via **76 specialized tools** \\- from neural semantic search to taint analysis and SBOM generation.\n\nNo cloud. Everything local. Blazingly fast **(\\~2 GiB/s parsing, sub-microsecond lookups).**\n\n**Why I Built This:**\n\nTired of fragmented tools that leak data or crawl at snail pace. **Narsil is:**\n\n* **14 Languages** \\- Rust, Python, JS/TS, Go, C/C++, Java, C#, Bash, Ruby, Kotlin, PHP with Tree-sitter precision\n* **Neural Search** \\- Voyage/OpenAI embeddings or local ONNX - find similar code even when names differ\n* **Security Fortress** \\- 111 rules for OWASP Top 10/CWE Top 25, taint tracking, fix suggestions\n* **Supply Chain** \\- SBOM generation (CycloneDX/SPDX), dependency vulns via OSV, license compliance\n* **Advanced Analysis** \\- Call graphs, CFG/DFG, type inference (Python/JS/TS without mypy/tsc), dead code detection\n* **WebAssembly** \\- Run in-browser for code playgrounds (\\~2-3MB gzipped)\n* **Visualisation Frontend** \\- Embedded web UI for interactive graphs (call flows, import graphs, complexity overlays)\n\n**Benchmarks**\n\n* Parsing throughput - **1.98 GiB/s**\n* Symbol lookup  - **483 ns**\n* BM25 full-text - **80 µs**\n* Linux kernel (78K files) - **45 seconds**\n\n*All offline-first, parallelised via Rayon, fully MCP-compliant.*\n\n**v1.0.0 Highlights**\n\n* **359 passing tests,** Criterion benchmarks\n* **Security hardening** (secret redaction, file size limits, path traversal fixes)\n* **Built-in type inference** for Python/JS/TS\n* **Neural embeddings** with semantic clone detection\n* **One-click installer script**\n* **Dual-licensed** MIT OR Apache-2.0\n\n**Try it out:**\n\n**One-liner install:**\n\n  `curl -fsSL` [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/postrv/narsil-mcp/main/install.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/postrv/narsil-mcp/main/install.sh) `| bash`\n\n**Or via Cargo:**\n\n  `cargo install narsil-mcp`\n\n* Repo: [https://github.com/postrv/narsil-mcp](https://github.com/postrv/narsil-mcp)\n* Crates.io: [https://crates.io/crates/narsil-mcp](https://crates.io/crates/narsil-mcp) \n* Awesome MCP Servers: [https://mcpservers.org/servers/postrv/narsil-mcp](https://mcpservers.org/servers/postrv/narsil-mcp)\n\nStar if you like it, fork/contribute if you spot issues, or give me \\*polite feedback\\* in the comments - let's reforge code intelligence together!\n\nPlease let me know what features you would like to see next!\n\nCheers,\n\npostrv\n\nP.S. \"And in the darkness bind them... with unbreakable code graphs.\" 🗡️",

There are some figures in the README. In general, the tradeoff re: token use is that you want to know that you're spending tokens to get good context. So, like any MCP server, yes Narsil burns tokens, but it should be able to give you context that no other tool can. Think of it as high return on investment for context tokens.   \nGive the presets a try and let me know what you think.",

Here are the things that I have, which are lacking in Serena (to the best of my knowledge):\n\n* **Neural/semantic search** (with Voyage AI, OpenAI embeddings, or local ONNX models; hybrid BM25 + TF-IDF + neural) - Serena has exact semantic/symbol search but doesn't offer embeddings support\n* **Call graph analysis** (get\\_call\\_graph, callers/callees, call paths, complexity metrics, hotspots)\n* **Control flow graphs (CFG)** and data flow analysis (DFG, reaching definitions, dead code/stores)\n* **Type inference** for dynamic languages (Python, JS/TS) without external tools + type error checking\n* **Security scanning & taint tracking** (injection vulnerabilities, OWASP Top 10, CWE Top 25, crypto/secrets rules, taint sources/flows)\n* **Supply chain security** (SBOM generation in CycloneDX/SPDX, dependency vulnerability checks via OSV, license compliance, upgrade paths)\n* **Git integration tools** (blame, file/commit/symbol history, recent changes, hotspots, contributors)\n* **Import/dependency graph analysis** (circular imports detection)\n* **Embedded interactive visualisation frontend** (Cytoscape.js graphs for calls, imports, structure)\n* **WASM/browser support** for client-side/offline use\n* **Much broader toolset** (76 specialized tools vs. Serena's core \\~7: symbol finding, references, and targeted insertion)\n* **Built-in high-performance full-text/hybrid search** (Tantivy-based, streaming results)\n* **Remote repository indexing** support (though writing this out has made me realise I need to test this last one!)\n\nWorth noting that Narsil is built in Rust for a reason - it's genuinely very fast (even if I did get roasted on r/rust for using the word \"Blazing\" without due irony disclaimers) - whereas Serena is Python which is only medium fast :)   \nLet me know if you have any other questions.",

A normal AI agent may arbitrarily query the codebase with bash commands, but this gives it a package of much more useful functions such as \"find me all the path traversal vulnerabilities in this repo\", or \"find me the highest complexity files that need refactoring\" or even \"find me the exact function name that retrieves code graph for the frontend\" and it would be able to answer these, rather than say grepping through the codebase and using bash and sampling. The fact that it indexes the codebase practically instantly and can turn that rapidly into complete understanding is a real blessing. I anticipate it could be used as an onboarding assistant, a security review tool, a refactoring accomplice, and more. But to be honest, its true value will only be know when people start adopting it.  \nThanks for checking it out and I hope you're having a great Christmas (with a name like Mr Freez, I imagine you are!) - let me know if you have any further questions when you've had a chance to try it.",

Works with any LLM (local or remote).\n\n  ## New in v2.5.0: Universal Format Support\n\n  - ✅ **Generic Markdown export** - works with ANY LLM\n  - ✅ **Claude AI** format (if you use Claude)\n  - ✅ **Google Gemini** format (with grounding)\n  - ✅ **OpenAI ChatGPT** format (with vector search)\n\n  ## Why This Matters for Local LLMs\n\n  Instead of context-dumping entire docs, you get:\n  - **Organized structure**: Categorized by topic (getting-started, API, examples, etc.)\n  - **Extracted patterns**: Code examples pulled from docs with syntax highlighting\n  - **Portable format**: Pure markdown ZIP - use with Ollama, llama.cpp, or any local model\n  - **Reusable**: Build once, use with any LLM\n\n  ## Quick Example\n\n  ```bash\n  # Install\n  pip install skill-seekers\n\n  # Scrape any documentation\n  skill-seekers scrape --config configs/react.json\n\n  # Export as universal markdown\n  skill-seekers package output/react/ --target markdown\n\n  # Result: react-markdown.zip with organized .md files\n```\n\n  The output is just structured markdown files - perfect for feeding to local models or adding to your RAG pipeline.\n\n  Features\n\n  - 📄 Documentation scraping with smart categorization\n  - 🐙 GitHub repository analysis\n  - 📕 PDF extraction (for PDF-based docs)\n  - 🔀 Multi-source unified (docs + code + PDFs in one skill)\n  - 🎯 24 preset configs (React, Vue, Django, Godot, etc.)\n\n  Links\n\n  - GitHub: https://github.com/yusufkaraaslan/Skill_Seekers\n  - PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/skill-seekers/\n  - Release: https://github.com/yusufkaraaslan/Skill_Seekers/releases/tag/v2.5.0\n\n  MIT licensed, contributions welcome!

You have to be very careful at times and build safe guards into your tools. For example in my mcp server I had a read\\_file tool. simple except for the fact it read a file much larger than it should have, the context immediately jumped to 800k tokens and the chat was unrecoverable.\n\nfrom there i started to build in hard coded limits like limiting the max lines readable to 500 for read\\_file. Then when we build composite tools, we can think of different ways to do them. My favorite is enum menus where tools can be more modular and one tool can serve many different functions.\n\nThen we can also add in batch tools.  \nbatch\\_read\\_files  \nbatch\\_string\\_replace  \nbatch\\_read\\_lines  \netc\n\nthis allow us to turn 20 calls into 1. A time saver and a context saver for the misc info we get from tool outputs.",

Add your database connections in the GUI (MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis, etc. - 11 total)\n2. Enable MCP server\n3. Point your AI agent to it\n4. Done. Works across all your projects.\n\n  **Key features:**\n\n*  Read-only mode per connection (AI can SELECT but can't DROP your prod tables)\n*  Query history - see exactly what queries were executed\n*  SSH tunnel support\n*  macOS, Windows, Linux\n\nLooking for feedback - is this something you'd actually use?

      "text": "Been using Claude with Microsoft 365 via MCP and hit two frustrations:\n\n**Problem 1: Context bloat**\n\nThe popular MS Graph MCPs expose 30-40 specialized tools like `list-mail-messages`, `create-calendar-event`, `get-user`, etc. That's ~12KB of context eaten up before you even start talking. Claude already knows the Graph API - it doesn't need 37 hand-holding tools.\n\n**Problem 2: Multi-tenant switching sucks**\n\nI manage multiple M365 tenants (work, clients, personal). Every time I wanted to query a different tenant, I had to call `select-account`, wait, then make my request. Constantly switching context.\n\n**The fix:**\n\nForked the Softeria MCP and stripped it down to 7 tools:\n- `login`, `logout`, `verify-login` (auth)\n- `list-accounts`, `select-account`, `remove-account` (account management)\n- `graph-request` (one tool for ALL Graph API calls)\n\nThe `graph-request` tool takes an `accountId` parameter, so you can query any tenant directly without switching:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"endpoint\": \"/me/messages\",\n  \"accountId\": \"client-tenant-abc123\"\n}\n```\n\nQuery work and personal calendars in the same conversation. No switching dance.\n\n~1KB context instead of ~12KB. Same capabilities.\n\n**Repo:** https://github.com/ForITLLC/forit-microsoft-graph\n\nMIT licensed, fork of Softeria's work. Just a different philosophy - less is more.\n\nAnyone else running into context bloat issues with MCPs?\n",

It avoids the long-context issue, but its reasoning capability is still inferior to directly prompting an LLM.\n\nAlternatively, we could still prompt an LLM but run it as a sub-agent, so the long tool-searching prompt doesn’t consume the main context window. But that sub-agent itself is still subject to the context too long issue. \n\nThanks",

      "text": "Hey everyone 👋,\n\nI’ve been experimenting with the new Gemini SDKs and Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) recently. Particularly Function Calling differences.  \n  \nI wanted to break down exactly how the function calling loop works under the hood and share a workflow for connecting it to a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tool Router.\n\nI figured this might be useful for anyone trying to bridge Gemini’s native tooling with MCP servers, so sharing here.\n\n\n\n**The Core Loop: How Gemini handles tools (earlier)**\n\nIf you're coming from other ecosystems, the Gemini loop is standard but strict on data structures. It essentially works like this:\n\n1. ***Declaration*****:** You pass `FunctionDeclaration` objects (*OpenAPI*\\-like schemas) in the `GenerateContentConfig`.\n2. **The Prompt:** Gemini ingests the prompt + tool schemas.\n3. **The Stop:** Instead of text, the model halts and returns a `functionCall` object in `content.parts`.\n4. **Execution (The Missing Link):** The generic SDK *doesn't* execute code for you. You have to parse the `functionCall`, execute your local code/API, and wrap the result.\n5. **The Return:** You send a new message with `role=\"tool\"` and the structured result.\n\nThe interesting part (and often the pain point) is handling the routing logic when you have dozens of tools.\n\n**Integrating an MCP Router (new flow)**\n\nWriting manual handlers for every tool gets messy fast. This is where using an MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tool Router helps abstract the execution layer.\n\nHere is a pattern for using Google ADK with an MCP Toolset. \n\n    from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent\n    from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_toolset import McpToolset\n    from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StreamableHTTPConnectionParams\n    \n    # ... (Standard Auth Setup) ...\n    \n    # 1. Create the MCP Session\n    # In this example, we use a router that aggregates search tools\n    composio_session = composio_client.experimental.tool_router.create_session(\n        user_id=COMPOSIO_USER_ID,\n        toolkits=[\"duckduckgo\", \"google_search\"] \n    )\n    \n    # 2. Connect ADK to the MCP URL\n    composio_mcp_url = composio_session.url\n    composio_toolset = McpToolset(\n        connection_params=StreamableHTTPConnectionParams(url=composio_mcp_url)\n    )\n    \n    # 3. Inject into the Agent\n    root_agent = Agent(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-pro\",\n        name=\"research_agent\",\n        # Instruction is critical for ADK to trust the tool output\n        instruction=(\n            \"You are a helpful assistant. \"\n            \"Use the available tools to answer user queries. \"\n            \"Execute the tools directly.\"\n        ),\n        tools=[composio_toolset], # <--- The MCP Toolset\n    )\n    \n\nThis example uses a router (via Composio in this instance, but the logic applies to other   \nMCP clients) to let the agent search/plan across available tools dynamically.\n\n**Why these matters?**\n\nUsing the `McpToolset` class in Google ADK allows the agent to treat the MCP server as a unified tool interface. \n\nYou don't need to manually define the schema for every single search function; the MCP handshake handles the capability discovery.\n\n  \n**Common Pitfalls**\n\nIf you are building this out, here are a few things that tripped me up:\n\n* **Schema Strictness:** Gemini is very sensitive to parameter types. If your MCP server returns a loose schema, Gemini might hallucinate arguments. Use Enums where possible.\n* **Error Propagation:** If the MCP tool fails, *return the error as a string* in the function response. Don't crash the app. Gemini can often read the error message (\"Error: 404 not found\") and self-correct or ask the user for clarification.\n* **Routing Latency:** Passing everything through a router adds a hop. For critical, low-latency tools, native function calling might still be faster than MCP.\n\nIf you want to grab the full source code for the agent setup or see a more detailed walkthrough of the environment configuration, I wrote up a guide here: [Function Calling & MCP using Google ADK](https://medium.com/composiohq/function-calling-mcp-using-google-adk-bf861421638e?postPublishedType=repub).\n\nHas anyone else here played with Google ADK's `McpToolset` yet? I'm curious how it compares to using the standard `sse`transport with other clients like Claude Desktop.\n\n",

The real gap is the \"Plumbing\" (Auth, Time-traveling state, Interruptibility).\n\n**I have a few \"hot takes\" from our dev process, and I’d love to know if you agree:**\n\n1. **Delegation > Memory:** Giving a sub-agent a huge artifact and then killing it is 10x more reliable than \"remembering\" past mistakes via a prompt.\n2. **Freshness is the #1 Failure:** If your agent isn't using tools like Context7 to get *today's* docs, it's useless for enterprise.\n3. **Plan First:** If the agent doesn't outline its logic before it hits an API, it's just vibing.\n\n**What’s the most \"understated\" lesson you’ve learned building agents?** What’s the thing that no one talks about on the landing pages but keeps you up at night?\n\nFull breakdown of our architecture shifts and references here: [https://www.getseer.dev/blogs/lessons-dec-2025](https://www.getseer.dev/blogs/lessons-dec-2025)",

Here's the [Full Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glR4XwuqfYY).\n\nAlso, You can find all code snippets here: [Github Repo](https://github.com/Arindam200/awesome-ai-apps/tree/main/course/aws_strands)\n\nWould love feedback from anyone building MCP-based or multi-agent systems in Strands.",

How do you handle name collisions (e.g., two servers having a `get_user` tool)?\n3. **Conversational Loop:** For those building custom clients, are you running the \"decide which tool to call\" logic inside the client app, or are you pushing that logic into the Gateway to keep the client \"thin\"?\n4. **Transport:** Since this is a custom client-to-gateway setup, is **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** the preferred transport for remote connections, or are people finding better success with **WebSockets** for bidirectional tool streaming?\n\nI'd love to hear from anyone building their own MCP ecosystem. What pitfalls should I avoid in the Gateway-to-Sub-Server communication?",

Read it. Every model has good hints in the API especially about tool calling. If you're square there....\n\nWhat I would recommend instead is steeling against hallucinations (always lol). Then gin up some test data and figure out what condition is enforceable and how. You'll need to test each condition and run many trials. Enforceable might be was the data created? (So a comparison of the prior and current state should be not null. Whenever you can create this kind of check.)\n\nAlso make sure that the work you're asking the llm to do actually requires a llm and isn't deterministic.

But it looks like it was retracted by Microsoft.\n\n\\- Google obviously prefers gRPC.\n\n\\- There seems to be an overloading of transport and API structure and/or idempotency/session management in the scope of the spec.\n\nIs this an accurate understanding?  Is JSON RPC scalable and is the direction stable?  Or is this tech debt due to Anthropic's current install base? Is HTTP/REST the likely future direction?\n\nThanks for any insight/corrections...",

The only way this can be true is if you conflate \"LLM\" with \"Chatbot\"/\"Agent\", and I think that's either dishonest, or irresponsible, or confused.\n\nLLMs do not directly use MCP, do not \"support\" MCP.  It's chatbots or agent tools that act as MCP clients talking to MCP Servers.   Things like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, VSCode, or a variety of others. Those are not LLMs. An MCP conversation exists without involving any LLM at all.  Look at the diagrams on the [modelcontextprotocol.io](http://modelcontextprotocol.io) website - it's very clear.\n\nThe way an LLM interfaces with tooling is prescribed by each LLM - Anthropic calls it \"tool calling\" and Gemini calls it \"function calling\" and I'm not sure about the others. That interface is not standardized, not at this point anyway.  And it has nothing to do with MCP.",

HTTP REST would be a smoother transition if that is supported in the future.",

                  "text": "Philosophically let me just call out that you should consider what is using your API, whether flask-based http or mcp-based (eg fastmcp). For the former, even if rest style, it's usually a deterministic process like a web front end. This is different than an llm-based agent in a few ways, but primarily you should be thinking of small simple apis and data structures for agents, more complex ones are fine for deterministic processes.\n\nSo \"scrape page x\" which takes a url for scraping a page is a fine MCP. For a rest service you might have dozens or more parameters which control the scraping. Putting those parameters in your MCP service will lead to the agent model improperly calling the service more often.\n\nLots of continuing challenges with MCP -- auth, async, etc. I expect there will be many changes over the next year, though sadly I don't think it will be moving away from JSON.\n\nAlso, MCP has some affordances rest doesn't -- for instance, with MCP you have the ability to put documentation right in the service explaining how to use it (resources), and you have the ability to have your service signal a human user needs to do something (elicitation). I expect over the next year this will continue to diverge from REST.",
