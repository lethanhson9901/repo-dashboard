      "text": "Recently introduced to MCP thinking the hard part would be getting a server running, but I was surprised that that was the easy bit.. the pain started when I tried to make it usable in practice like custom server logic, proper auth and permissions, logging and analytics.. to understand what the agent is doing, and then figuring out how to host it safely without creating a security mess\n\nWanted to connect Postgres and some internal docs to Claude Desktop, but turning that into something I’d be comfortable running for more than a demo took way longer than expected.\n\nI needed to find a tool mostly out of fatigue, and it helped with a lot of the plumbing (especially auth, logging, and hosting), but I’m curious how others are handling this (ogment ai, in case anyone else is using it). Are people rolling their own production MCP servers, or is there a better pattern I’m missing?",

      "text": "You’ll see posts saying “MCPs are a fad,” and other posts saying “MCPs are amazing.” I think both sides are missing the point.\n\nMCPs exist because they’re solving a very real pain *right now*.\n\nWhen Anthropic shipped MCP, the intent was clear: make it easier for models to plug into real systems. The “USB-C for AI tools” line was great marketing, but the deeper truth is simpler: MCP fit their product constraints and made integrations safer and more repeatable.\n\nThen adoption took off and a narrative formed: “This is the new wave.”\n\nBut I don’t think teams adopted MCP because everyone concluded it’s the One True Interface. Adoption happened because lots of teams hit the same wall at the same time: **LLMs weren’t reliable enough to write integration code live without messing it up.**\n\nIn theory, if a model could generate perfect code every time, you wouldn’t need MCP. The model could just generate whatever connector you need on the spot and it would work. But that wasn’t the world we were living in. Models could code, sure—but “pretty good” isn’t good enough when you’re dealing with production systems, permissions, and actions that move money.\n\nFast-forward to now: models are meaningfully better at code. And you can see the product direction shifting with that reality. Anthropic started talking about *code-based tool calling*—roughly: “what if tools are scripts (real code) instead of only protocol-shaped endpoints?” That arc naturally leads into things like Skills.\n\nThat’s the part I find most interesting: *tooling evolves with model capability.* MCP made sense when models needed tighter guardrails. Code-first approaches make more sense as models get stronger.\n\nAnd all this brings me to what we’re releasing today.\n\nWe’re releasing a framework called [Operai](https://github.com/brwse/operai) (operations + AI, and yes, a nod to operads). Call it a plug if you want—it's public and we think it’s the better direction for the ecosystem.\n\nOur main thesis is: Instead of orchestrating agents + a giant pile of tools, *orchestrate tools with policies* and keep the tool surface area *small, scoped, and deliberate.*\n\nWhy?\n\n* *A dedicated toolset beats a Swiss Army knife.* You can fumble around with a “do-everything” MCP, or you can just program a tool that does the job—cleanly, predictably, and safely.\n* *Policy orchestration matters more than agent orchestration.* In a real org, leadership doesn’t micromanage every person’s steps. They define constraints: approval rules, audit requirements, budgets, access boundaries. When you “orchestrate agents,” you’re implicitly trying to micromanage. You shouldn’t care about the agent’s personality—you should care about **what it is allowed to do**.\n\nOperai uses an *effect-based policy system*: agents can behave flexibly, but the system enforces guardrails on side effects. The policies protect the endgame.\n\nThe workflow with operai is simple:\n\n1. Create a Git repo that stores your tools.\n2. Build tools with your favorite coding assistant + the Operai CLI.\n3. Serve them with Operai.\n\nUnder the hood we made choices that are biased toward enterprise reality and how LLMs actually behave. For example, we chose Rust because Python/JS don’t give you compile-time guarantees—and when you’re exposing capabilities to an agent, you want as many guarantees as you can get.\n\n**Why do we think this is where things go?**\n\nBecause programs aren’t going away. Even with infinite context, we’re not “hedging probability” here—we’re enforcing logic: access control, schemas, invariants, side effects, logging, auditing. Those aren’t optional. The transport is secondary. What we need is a solid mechanism for AI to generate **good** programs—not ad-hoc scripts, not unaudited glue code, but real software: versioned, typed, testable, reviewable, observable. The kind of quality level you’d expect from something like ripgrep.\n\nSo our bet is simple:\n\nThe future isn’t picking a single protocol and arguing forever. It’s treating tools like real software—whether it's fully authored by a human or an AI—without pretending the model is perfect.",

For everything else, our effects system is what drives everything.\n\nFor example, for the things you mentioned, you can use the following policies:\n\n    [[policies]]\n    name = \"rbac-policy\"\n    version = \"1.0\"\n    \n    [[policies.effects]]\n    tool = \"admin.*\"       # Pattern matching for tool names\n    stage = \"before\"       # Run before the tool executes\n    when = \"user.id != 'Fred'\"\n    fail_message = \"permission denied: Admin access required.\"\n    \n    [[policies]]\n    name = \"deploy-approval\"\n    version = \"1.0\"\n    \n    # Initialize state\n    [[policies.context]\n    approval_status = \"pending\"\n    \n    # Rule 1: Guard the sensitive tool\n    [[policies.effects]]\n    tool = \"deploy_prod\"\n    stage = \"before\"\n    when = \"context.approval_status != 'granted'\"\n    fail_message = \"Deployment requires approval. Please run 'request_approval' first.\"\n    \n    # Rule 2: Grant approval (Action)\n    # Assumes you created an 'approve_request' tool and it was called successfully\n    [[policies.effects]]\n    tool = \"approve_request\"\n    stage = \"after\"\n    when = \"result.is_ok\"\n    [policies.effects.set]\n    approval_status = \"'granted'\"\n\nI think you can probably come up with cost control example (we'll write a list of examples in the repo at some point).\n\nYou would handle policies like you would in a large scale systems. You can bundle them however you wish and deploy it to the file system (for example, ConfigMap in K8S).",

Even if an MCP is completely stateless, MCPs are not cross-system invariant in general. Ultimately this means you are back to just coding a server that works for your use-case which is basically just API programming again. With Operai, you can code once and it will literally expand (this is a rust joke) to every use-case (API, tools, even code mode \\[but we're not convinced code mode is actually the best solution\\]).",

      "text": "Got a few questions in my dms after yesterday's post about Code Mode, so writing up the actual MCP setup process since the folks asked how to get started.\n\n**Basic connection is pretty simple:**\n\nConnect to any MCP server via STDIO, HTTP, or SSE. For local tools like filesystem stuff, STDIO works fine. Remote services use HTTP.\n\n`{ \"mcp\": { \"client_configs\": [{ \"name\": \"filesystem\", \"connection_type\": \"stdio\", \"stdio_config\": { \"command\": \"npx\", \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@anthropic/mcp-filesystem\"] } }] } }`\n\n**Important security detail:**\n\nTool calls from the LLM are just suggestions by default. Nothing actually executes unless you explicitly call the execution endpoint. This caught me off guard initially but it's the right design - prevents accidental API calls or data modifications.\n\nIf you want autonomous execution, enable Agent Mode and specify which tools can auto-execute via `tools_to_auto_execute`.\n\n**Code Mode setup (from yesterday):**\n\nSet `is_code_mode_client: true` on your MCP clients. LLM writes TypeScript to orchestrate tools instead of the standard iterative approach. Cuts tokens significantly when you have multiple servers.\n\n**Tool filtering:**\n\nControl which tools are available per request or per virtual key. Useful for different environments or team permissions.\n\nBifrost can also act as an MCP server - expose your tools to Claude Desktop or other MCP clients through the gateway URL.\n\nSetup docs: [https://docs.getbifrost.ai/features/mcp](https://docs.getbifrost.ai/features/mcp)  \nGithub: [https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost)\n\nAnyone run into issues setting this up?",

Characters alone had \\`create\\_character\\`, \\`get\\_character\\`, \\`update\\_character\\`, \\`delete\\_character\\`, \\`list\\_characters\\`. Multiply that across items, quests, combat, parties, etc. and we ended up with 195 tools and \\~50k tokens of schema definitions.\n\nThe fix was simple. Instead of separate tools per operation, we made domain tools with an \\`action\\` enum:\n\nBefore\n\ncreate\\_character\n\nget\\_character\n\nupdate\\_character\n\ndelete\\_character\n\nlist\\_characters\n\nAfter\n\ncharacter\\_manage(action: \"create\" | \"get\" | \"update\" | \"delete\" | \"list\" | \"search\")\n\nApplied across the board, this dropped us to 28 tools and \\~6-8k tokens of schema. Same functionality, 85% less overhead.\n\nWe also added fuzzy matching on action values so typos get helpful suggestions instead of opaque failures.\n\nIf you’re building MCP servers and your tool count is ballooning, action enums might be worth considering.

The LLM keeps reaching for the simple dice roll instead of the combat actions that would do the heavy lifting for it.\nI think the model sees “I need to roll dice” and pattern-matches to the simpler tool, even though the domain-specific one would give it a complete resolution in one call. Been trying to steer it with prompting but it’s stubborn. The math tools were meant for crazy stuff like calculating the trajectory of a cannon ball, or calculating how far an enemy is that is flying in 3d space not simple dice rolls. \n\nSo yeah, per-action rules or even just tool prioritization/hints would help a lot. Something like “prefer combat_manage.attack over math_tools.roll when in combat” at the schema level. Haven’t figured out the cleanest way to express that yet.",

FastMCP brings a Pythonic approach: minimal ceremony, flexibility, and integration with Python’s ecosystem ￼. \n\nFrontMCP tends to be better when you need robust typing, modular architecture (multiple apps/tenants), and out-of-the-box solutions for cross-cutting concerns. \nFastMCP is better when you need quick development in Python or want to compose and deploy MCP services with existing Python infrastructure. Both adhere to the MCP specification and support core features like streaming responses, sessions, and secure transport, so either can get the job done. The choice often comes down to the language and feature philosophy that fit your project best. \n\nFrontMCP clearly stands out in areas like TypeScript DX and plugin-based extensibility, which can give it an edge for complex, large-scale applications that require maintainability and strong typing ￼￼.\nFastMCP’s maturity and simplicity make it a reliable choice for Python-centric teams or simpler use cases where quick development is paramount.",

It’s basically a standard way to expose tools to an agent without bloating context or writing custom glue for every service. For example, when an agent needs live web data, instead of hardcoding scrapers or APIs, you can put a web-access layer behind MCP. That’s where setups like Bright Data’s [MCP server](https://github.com/brightdata/brightdata-mcp) come in: the agent calls search/browse/extract tools on demand, and the infrastructure handles access and blocking.

Or it gets back to me with what they decided and I approve or ask them to discuss again based on the new info. \n\nThe easiest thing, if you have Claude code cli, would be to ask Claude to create an Mcp for you. It has Mcp builder built in and will do a pretty good job. As long as you tell it what you need.",

Attention is computed as softmax(QK\\^T/√d\\_k)V - the Q from your current forward pass is computing dot products against cached K vectors. If those K vectors came from a different model's projection matrices, you're computing similarity in incompatible latent spaces. The attention scores are meaningless.\n\nBeyond that: different tokenizers (e.g., Claude's BPE vs Gemini's SentencePiece), different vocabulary mappings, different embedding dimensions, different positional encoding schemes. Token 4521 doesn't reference the same subword, and even if it did, the embedding vector lives in a completely different learned manifold.\n\nThere is no harness that reconciles incompatible learned representations. The \"harness solution\" (serialize text, re-tokenize, re-embed in target model's native space) exists precisely BECAUSE architectural constraints make true state sharing impossible.\n\nDismissing this as \"not an architecture question\" demonstrates a fundamental confusion about what the harness layer is abstracting over and why.\n\nedit: realizing you didn't actually read my whole response, or OPs response to it...  wrote this before i realized that.",
