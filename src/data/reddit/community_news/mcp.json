      "text": "I’ve been using MCPs extensively at work, so I thought I’d share some of the ones I’ve found most useful.\n\nMy main criteria were minimal setup, reliability, and whether I kept using them after the novelty wore off:\n\n1. Context7 MCP: (Documentation and knowledge)This is by far the best MCP I’ve used for coding. It helps your agents fetch the latest documentation automatically. For me, I used to ask the agent to implement a feature X from Y technology and I have never had to deal with documentation.\n2. Firecrawl MCP / Jina Reader MCP: These are good for turning URLs into clean Markdown. They strip boilerplate, nav, and ads so the agent can focus on the actual article, although very interactive apps or paywalled content may still require a manual check.\n3. Figma MCP: (Design and UI) Design-to-code is the basic necessity nowadays for frontend development. This MCP server exposes the live structure of the layer you have selected in Figma, which includes hierarchy, auto‑layout, variants, text styles, and token references. Tools like Claude, Cursor, or Windsurf can use it to generate code against real designs instead of screenshots.\n4. Slack / Messaging MCP: High “aha” factor with very low effort. Once an agent can talk where humans already are, teams love it instantly. My team even used this for something as basic as ordering and tracking deliveries for team lunch, which ended up being one of the most-used workflows for us.\n5. GitHub MCP: This is what finally made Claude feel like an actual teammate instead of a smarter autocomplete. If you’re tired of copy-pasting repos into prompts, you’re gonna love it. It’s especially helpful for issue + commit context grounding and repo exploration.\n\nSuper curious to hear what MCPs all of you have found useful?",

I’ve experimented a bit, but I still find myself being cautious about *what* actually deserves to persist.\n\nThanks for sharing your MCP.

Same concept as Context7 but for tribal knowledge that isn't public. We built one that indexes our internal runbooks and now the agent can answer \"how do we handle X\" without anyone having to search Notion.The GitHub MCP point resonates. Before that, codebase exploration felt like playing telephone. Now Claude can actually understand the structure and history instead of just seeing whatever I copy-paste.Slack MCP is underrated for non-engineering use cases too. We use it for approval workflows - agent drafts something, posts to Slack for human review, then acts on the response. Turns what used to be manual back-and-forth into async [handoffs.One](http://handoffs.One) thing I've noticed: the MCPs that stick are the ones that eliminate repetitive context-stuffing. Anything where you're constantly re-explaining the same background info to the model is a good candidate for an MCP.What's your setup for the Figma one?

      "text": "We started working with MCP at Anysite almost immediately after its release. Beyond that, I extensively use third-party services both for AI agents and with Claude Desktop / Code. This weekend, while developing our new agent for analyzing large data volumes and collecting datasets, I concluded that MCP (at least in its current form) is not suitable for scaling AI agent functionality. The issue is the context that tool descriptions occupy. Currently, I use several MCPs regularly: Anysite, Zoom, Gmail, Postgres, GitLab, GitHub, and several custom ones. Anysite alone takes up ~21,000 tokens of context used with every LLM call. All my MCPs occupy around 40,000 and are approaching the recommended limit of 50,000 (beyond which MCP becomes dramatically less effective because the LLM gets confused). But what if we want a universal agent with tools for every occasion? The number of tools and context they occupy will tend toward infinity.\nMCP as a protocol is unlikely to be fundamentally improved. What are the ways out?\n1. Increasing context window. Not a solution. Tool selection efficiency plateaus at ~100k tokens even with a 1M context window.\n2. Optimizing MCP descriptions. Yes. We can reduce context footprint by 2–3x without significant quality loss. But this can't be done indefinitely.\n3. Dynamic tool invocation. Don't store all tools in context but provide tools for searching necessary ones based on the task. Though officially supported, it doesn't work in practice, and effectiveness depends on developer implementation — not trivial.\n4. Delegate via MCP to specialized agents. Closer to what we're building at Anysite. Finding tools for a specific agent is an order of magnitude easier than for a universal one.\n5. Embed tool usage during LLM training and give MCP only template tools (code execution, API calls). Most reliable but complex/costly — tools appear faster than models retrain.\nI think we'll arrive at a hybrid of methods 4 and 5 — specialized agents using custom small LLMs tailored for specific tasks, learning on the fly. This will become infrastructure for the agentic economy. And we at Anysite will bring this closer with every release.",

If you check my comment history I was likely one of the first in the world. \n\nThat said, and back when MCP was released, I created an MCP/tool management MCP with an intelligent layer that literally spins up a customized agent JUST for whatever the current atomic task is. \n\nAgain, nothing else is needed beyond the stack above. Software development patterns were a solved thing (distributed microservices), but for some reason everyone (literally everyone even at top engineering shops) lost their heads and forgot how to do things properly. Never made sense to me. \n\nAt first I used Cerebras to get insanely fast tool selection and programmatic agent spin up. Then when the Gemma3 270m dropped I took all the logs I’d saved and fune-tuned a tool router… it’s basically magic and so fast/efficient. \n\nNot trying to be all high and mighty but the correct way to read the MCP spec is how the ChatGPT MCP connector forces you to do it: two ‘tools’. 1) list tools (workflows, whole actions) and 2) execute tool. MCP was never meant to be an API wrapper. That’s why everyone was ‘what use is MCP’ for the first year+ after its release. Even before building a custom router and spinning up distributed agents each MCP should show just 2 tools. But the github server alone exposed what? 27 or 14 or something? Like I said, the biggest shops in the world are really bad at agentic development; Reddit, everyone. They don’t get it either. \n\nHope this helps.",

A common work flow is:\n\n\\`/research\\` -> \\`/create\\_plan\\` -> \\`/implement\\_plan\\`\n\n1. You /research slash command + prompt can find the MCP calls needed for what you want to do and be very specific. Output should be a document with the list of selected calls from each MCP to do the job. Some MCP calls will be made for research others will just be mentioned as to which ones are needed later. \\[Here\\]([https://gist.github.com/itissid/8a3969c4d1495e44ca9391dd8849f9b5](https://gist.github.com/itissid/8a3969c4d1495e44ca9391dd8849f9b5)) is an example of how I use it, you can add your MCPs to it.\n2.

Give it above document and a prompt to do what you want. Use the research document and creates a plan. Here skills can have more detailed description of what each MCP does and a function to preprocess results. I would think of it this way. Another idea is to use sub agents. What should be a Skill/Subagent and what should be an MCP?\n\n* If an MCP needs custom pre-processing it should be a skill and skills can call tools locally to post process, which is more efficient than going through MCPs to do this.\n* If you can do the post processing with tool scopes then use agents(in \\`.claude/agents/\\` for example \\[here\\]([https://gist.github.com/itissid/d9c289e5aca0465eb8e09f71a374d2c2](https://gist.github.com/itissid/d9c289e5aca0465eb8e09f71a374d2c2)) is a web search agent.\n\n1. /implement\\_plan.

      "text": "You’ll see posts saying “MCPs are a fad,” and other posts saying “MCPs are amazing.” I think both sides are missing the point.\n\nMCPs exist because they’re solving a very real pain *right now*.\n\nWhen Anthropic shipped MCP, the intent was clear: make it easier for models to plug into real systems. The “USB-C for AI tools” line was great marketing, but the deeper truth is simpler: MCP fit their product constraints and made integrations safer and more repeatable.\n\nThen adoption took off and a narrative formed: “This is the new wave.”\n\nBut I don’t think teams adopted MCP because everyone concluded it’s the One True Interface. Adoption happened because lots of teams hit the same wall at the same time: **LLMs weren’t reliable enough to write integration code live without messing it up.**\n\nIn theory, if a model could generate perfect code every time, you wouldn’t need MCP. The model could just generate whatever connector you need on the spot and it would work. But that wasn’t the world we were living in. Models could code, sure—but “pretty good” isn’t good enough when you’re dealing with production systems, permissions, and actions that move money.\n\nFast-forward to now: models are meaningfully better at code. And you can see the product direction shifting with that reality. Anthropic started talking about *code-based tool calling*—roughly: “what if tools are scripts (real code) instead of only protocol-shaped endpoints?” That arc naturally leads into things like Skills.\n\nThat’s the part I find most interesting: *tooling evolves with model capability.* MCP made sense when models needed tighter guardrails. Code-first approaches make more sense as models get stronger.\n\nAnd all this brings me to what we’re releasing today.\n\nWe’re releasing a framework called [Operai](https://github.com/brwse/operai) (operations + AI, and yes, a nod to operads). Call it a plug if you want—it's public and we think it’s the better direction for the ecosystem.\n\nOur main thesis is: Instead of orchestrating agents + a giant pile of tools, *orchestrate tools with policies* and keep the tool surface area *small, scoped, and deliberate.*\n\nWhy?\n\n* *A dedicated toolset beats a Swiss Army knife.* You can fumble around with a “do-everything” MCP, or you can just program a tool that does the job—cleanly, predictably, and safely.\n* *Policy orchestration matters more than agent orchestration.* In a real org, leadership doesn’t micromanage every person’s steps. They define constraints: approval rules, audit requirements, budgets, access boundaries. When you “orchestrate agents,” you’re implicitly trying to micromanage. You shouldn’t care about the agent’s personality—you should care about **what it is allowed to do**.\n\nOperai uses an *effect-based policy system*: agents can behave flexibly, but the system enforces guardrails on side effects. The policies protect the endgame.\n\nThe workflow with operai is simple:\n\n1. Create a Git repo that stores your tools.\n2. Build tools with your favorite coding assistant + the Operai CLI.\n3. Serve them with Operai.\n\nUnder the hood we made choices that are biased toward enterprise reality and how LLMs actually behave. For example, we chose Rust because Python/JS don’t give you compile-time guarantees—and when you’re exposing capabilities to an agent, you want as many guarantees as you can get.\n\n**Why do we think this is where things go?**\n\nBecause programs aren’t going away. Even with infinite context, we’re not “hedging probability” here—we’re enforcing logic: access control, schemas, invariants, side effects, logging, auditing. Those aren’t optional. The transport is secondary. What we need is a solid mechanism for AI to generate **good** programs—not ad-hoc scripts, not unaudited glue code, but real software: versioned, typed, testable, reviewable, observable. The kind of quality level you’d expect from something like ripgrep.\n\nSo our bet is simple:\n\nThe future isn’t picking a single protocol and arguing forever. It’s treating tools like real software—whether it's fully authored by a human or an AI—without pretending the model is perfect.",

Also regarding audit logs, you just hook a database to operai which captures all activity. For everything else, our effects system is what drives everything.\n\nFor example, for the things you mentioned, you can use the following policies:\n\n    [[policies]]\n    name = \"rbac-policy\"\n    version = \"1.0\"\n    \n    [[policies.effects]]\n    tool = \"admin.*\"       # Pattern matching for tool names\n    stage = \"before\"       # Run before the tool executes\n    when = \"user.id != 'Fred'\"\n    fail_message = \"permission denied: Admin access required.\"\n    \n    [[policies]]\n    name = \"deploy-approval\"\n    version = \"1.0\"\n    \n    # Initialize state\n    [[policies.context]\n    approval_status = \"pending\"\n    \n    # Rule 1: Guard the sensitive tool\n    [[policies.effects]]\n    tool = \"deploy_prod\"\n    stage = \"before\"\n    when = \"context.approval_status != 'granted'\"\n    fail_message = \"Deployment requires approval. Please run 'request_approval' first.\"\n    \n    # Rule 2: Grant approval (Action)\n    # Assumes you created an 'approve_request' tool and it was called successfully\n    [[policies.effects]]\n    tool = \"approve_request\"\n    stage = \"after\"\n    when = \"result.is_ok\"\n    [policies.effects.set]\n    approval_status = \"'granted'\"\n\nI think you can probably come up with cost control example (we'll write a list of examples in the repo at some point).\n\nYou would handle policies like you would in a large scale systems.

Even if an MCP is completely stateless, MCPs are not cross-system invariant in general. Ultimately this means you are back to just coding a server that works for your use-case which is basically just API programming again. With Operai, you can code once and it will literally expand (this is a rust joke) to every use-case (API, tools, even code mode \\[but we're not convinced code mode is actually the best solution\\]).",

For local tools like filesystem stuff, STDIO works fine. Remote services use HTTP.\n\n`{ \"mcp\": { \"client_configs\": [{ \"name\": \"filesystem\", \"connection_type\": \"stdio\", \"stdio_config\": { \"command\": \"npx\", \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@anthropic/mcp-filesystem\"] } }] } }`\n\n**Important security detail:**\n\nTool calls from the LLM are just suggestions by default. Nothing actually executes unless you explicitly call the execution endpoint. This caught me off guard initially but it's the right design - prevents accidental API calls or data modifications.\n\nIf you want autonomous execution, enable Agent Mode and specify which tools can auto-execute via `tools_to_auto_execute`.\n\n**Code Mode setup (from yesterday):**\n\nSet `is_code_mode_client: true` on your MCP clients. LLM writes TypeScript to orchestrate tools instead of the standard iterative approach. Cuts tokens significantly when you have multiple servers.\n\n**Tool filtering:**\n\nControl which tools are available per request or per virtual key. Useful for different environments or team permissions.\n\nBifrost can also act as an MCP server - expose your tools to Claude Desktop or other MCP clients through the gateway URL.\n\nSetup docs: [https://docs.getbifrost.ai/features/mcp](https://docs.getbifrost.ai/features/mcp)  \nGithub: [https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost)\n\nAnyone run into issues setting this up?",

Characters alone had \\`create\\_character\\`, \\`get\\_character\\`, \\`update\\_character\\`, \\`delete\\_character\\`, \\`list\\_characters\\`. Multiply that across items, quests, combat, parties, etc. and we ended up with 195 tools and \\~50k tokens of schema definitions.\n\nThe fix was simple. Instead of separate tools per operation, we made domain tools with an \\`action\\` enum:\n\nBefore\n\ncreate\\_character\n\nget\\_character\n\nupdate\\_character\n\ndelete\\_character\n\nlist\\_characters\n\nAfter\n\ncharacter\\_manage(action: \"create\" | \"get\" | \"update\" | \"delete\" | \"list\" | \"search\")\n\nApplied across the board, this dropped us to 28 tools and \\~6-8k tokens of schema. Same functionality, 85% less overhead.\n\nWe also added fuzzy matching on action values so typos get helpful suggestions instead of opaque failures.\n\nIf you’re building MCP servers and your tool count is ballooning, action enums might be worth considering.

The LLM keeps reaching for the simple dice roll instead of the combat actions that would do the heavy lifting for it.\nI think the model sees “I need to roll dice” and pattern-matches to the simpler tool, even though the domain-specific one would give it a complete resolution in one call. Been trying to steer it with prompting but it’s stubborn. The math tools were meant for crazy stuff like calculating the trajectory of a cannon ball, or calculating how far an enemy is that is flying in 3d space not simple dice rolls. \n\nSo yeah, per-action rules or even just tool prioritization/hints would help a lot. Something like “prefer combat_manage.attack over math_tools.roll when in combat” at the schema level. Haven’t figured out the cleanest way to express that yet.",

What I've tried:\n\n* Codex's built-in web search tool: can't browse JS-only sites. In my case, it's unable to browse developer.apple.com.\n* \\`microsoft/playwright-mcp\\`: It's able to perform searches and read pages, but very heavy hit on context. Burned through 10% of the context window for a single search.\n* [Exa.ai](http://Exa.ai), [context7.com](http://context7.com), Brave Search MCP: I'm strongly turned off by the pay-per-thousand model or caps on free plans. I understand they have to make money, it's just not what I want to spend money on.\n* [https://github.com/arabold/docs-mcp-server:](https://github.com/arabold/docs-mcp-server:) I didn't test this, but I was turned off by the fact you have to run the server in the background instead of allowing it to be booted by the Codex instance (via npx) like it can for other kinds of MCP servers.\n\nDoes anyone have a solution to this that hits on all marks: free, able to read websites including JS ones, thorough and high-quality?",

No standard for MCP server auth yet.\n* **OWASP Agentic Top 10** shipped in December — an actual security framework now exists.\n\nPut together a research hub covering all the protocols, payment rails, identity approaches, and security frameworks.\n\nKeeping it updated.
