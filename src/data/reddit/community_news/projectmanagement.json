Some even deleted without reading it. \n\nDoes anyone else just presume no one is going to read their emails but still send them anyway? What's your preferred way to get general information to people, weekly cadence with all participants? smaller communications with active participants and only general updates to larger group less frequently?

Everyone will stop looking at your and stop paying attention. All eyes will immediately drop, the person will become disengaged, and they will block you out and will read what you just put in front of them. If Bezos did that the garbage about making them read for 30 minutes is nothing more than trying to clean up a mess he created.\n\n30 minutes of reading time is ten pages, not a \"brief/memo/report.\"\n\nI don't let these situations happen. I send out the agenda beforehand and team members review and bring that agenda to the meeting (they can add agenda items if they want beforehand). We immediately talk about the agenda items, no Kabuki theater or special dances. Reviewing and bringing the agenda to the meeting is a standard, not a suggestion. The first meeting I ever ran I did hand out agendas first and watched every face immediately ignore me and drop to read the sheet I just put in front of them. I figured it out in about two seconds. Now it's no longer a problem.",

That forces a habit that creates your frustration when you do have something important to convey. A few things I would suggest that may help:  \n1) Think about why you want to communicate in the first place. What is the use/outcome for your audience?  \n2) What channel is most acceptable to the audience you need to reach?  \n3) What is the urgency of the communication?\n\nOften through these questions you can do a few thing:  \n1) Tailor the communication so it is more valuable.   \n2) Reach a smaller audience so the communication is targeted to who needs to receive it.   \n3) Use a channel that will be consulted.   \n4) Use a channel that matches the urgency of the communication. \n\nHappy to chat further if that isn't helpful.",

They recently did a large round of layoffs and laid off \\~10% of the PM department in that round. While that percentage was one of the higher ones, every department had to layoff the same headcount.\n\nThe problem I've seen is while PMs are almost always super undervalued and typically an easy target for layoffs, companies love to dump the busywork no one else wants to do on the PM team even if it is work an SEM should be doing. I would almost guarantee that is what saved the PM team at the company.",

Then when they merge, it runs through all of our automated tests and if it passes, we have a release manager interface where they can promote it through to staging then production just by clicking buttons. And if they need to rollback they just click a button as well. So the full pipeline can be managed by non-technical engineers. \n\n2. For more rapid feature dev and experiments we can use replit, v0, figma make and easily build apps on top of our existing APIs and deploy them via the same release manager, and they can all exist inside our main app domain alongside our core apps. All without needing to involve the core “engineering” team. \n\nWe basically restructured our infrastructure and tooling to allow anyone in the business to work on and release features and apps, and created a base layer of context and resources that allow them to get up and running really fast.",

At the time, I thought I was just procrastinating or entertaining myself, but looking back now after 25 years in the corporate world, I realize those games were actually my very first lessons in strict Risk Management.\n\nIn those games, every single assumption you make, whether to turn left into a dark hallway, when to save your limited ammo, or trusting a new character, can backfire immediately. In Project Management terms, those are unmitigated risks waiting to blow up your critical path. I realized that the monsters I face now just look different. Instead of zombies, they are missed deadlines, scope creep, and hidden dependencies, but the mindset required to survive is exactly the same.\n\nYou have to anticipate the risks before they appear around the corner, you have to manage your limited resources because you never know when a boss fight (a steering committee meeting) is coming up, and you always need a contingency plan for when things go sideways. \n\nIt turns out those wasted hours in front of a screen weren't wasted at all; they were training for the chaos I manage today.\n\nI am curious if anyone else has a similar experience where a \"useless\" hobby turned out to be the best training for your career. \n\nDid anyone else learn stakeholder management from Dungeons & Dragons or resource allocation from playing Age of Empires?",

You can't rely on a paycheck to keep people in line; you have to rely entirely on culture, shared purpose, and social influence.

Pay attention to things like which projects and operations initiatives get funded vs don't, what executives ask about vs ignore, metrics that impact decisions, and where risk is accepted vs addressed.  \n\nLearn how to frame things in business language, instead of project management language.  This can be hard when you've poured the PMBOK Guide into your brain, but execs rarely speak in PMBOK.  They speak in terms of tradeoffs, impacts, and outcomes.  The concepts can be similar but they get expressed differently.\n\nIf you can find a mentor at your company it could prove helpful.  You can also check if your local PMI chapter has a mentorship program, but it's hard to say if they'd have a mentor for business acumen.\n\nI pursued my MBA early in my career, which helped expose me to a lot of the concepts.  One of the challenges, however, was that I was too junior and wasn't exposed to how they were applied at work.  That took time and experience.  Once you start intentionally learning business acumen, begin intentionally applying it as well.  Examine your projects and ask:\n\n* What does this project enable, protect, or reduce?\n* What happens if we don't do it?\n* What is the cost of delay?\n* Who benefits?  How?\n\n...and build decision-feedback loops into your decisions:\n\n* Make a decision\n* Write down your assumptions and expected outcomes\n* Once the outcomes are known, ask yourself, \"What did I miss?\"\n* Evaluate why you missed it and what you can learn from the experience\n\nWash, rinse, repeat - this will help you develop pattern recognition while refining important skills.",

Key concepts are as follows: \n\n**Individual behaviours -** you need to understand what motivates and drives individuals and how their personal traits, values attitude influence their behaviour and is the most complex to understand because you start taking on basic psychology understanding. \n\nA good place to start is finding out if people are generally intrinsically or extrinsically valued and some project practitioners may agree or disagree and use some psueudosience principles such the the Myers Briggs 16 personality types and how they interact within the team and organisation. Also the DISC Theorem which is based upon 4 personality types (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and Conscientious) and how it influences team building dynamics. The last is the Alan Tuckman’s stages of group development (forming, storming, norming, performing) model. These are all starting points for your consideration and I have found the extremely useful when trying to understand project performance delivery. Is it bullet proof, no but it provides insights to common individual and corporate behaviour. \n\n**Group dynamics -** you need to study on how people interact within the team, how they communicate, how and who leads and the most important is conflict resolution and how they approach that. This comes down to observation and leading back to individual behaviour and how they influence group dynamics particularly those disruptors within a team, the key is to understand their motivation. \n\n**Organisational culture -** It’s the tone that the organisation sets, what values and beliefs and practices it has and how it shapes organisational policy and how it behaves. But most importantly on how it impacts employees. \n\nThe reason on why Org Behaviour needs to be understood by project practitioners because it facilitates understanding, performance and the most important thing that it facilitates is change. \n\nJust a spitball on a very broad subject and if you want to become a great PM, this is the very reason on why EQ skills are extremely important as a project practitioner. I hope that gives you a bit of insight. ",

Those are things you can control. With your team, delegate tasks that should be theirs to do and they're just being lazy about it. If it's directly related to the project paperwork then yes that's on you. But if it's stuff related to what your implementation or developer person needs to be doing then make them do it. Idk your background prior to being a PM, but for me I was in IT doing helpdesk to field tech to manager. So yes I can do the IT stuff but in my role as a PM I'm not going to because we have ppl for that role.\n\nFor your bosses, let them know that you're at your max capacity for projects and they need to hire another PM or they need to divide the work load better. If after directly telling them there is no change definitely start looking for other roles and leave that place in your rearview. Make sure to block out admin time for yourself on your calendar so you don't have meetings stack up. WFH ppl tend to forget that we also need breaks as if we were in the office, so treat it the same.",

Make a pass through the list to see what you can say \"no\" or \"not now\" to. Then focus on the remaining tasks. You sound like you might be someone who feels ownership and takes responsibility when you shouldn't.

No joke, I hear this from the team that trains us on this software, \"this streamlines the process and makes it so much easier and faster.\"  That would be true IF I DID THAT F'ING PROCESS EVERY DAY ALL DAY! I ONLY NEED TO USE THIS F'ING THING ONCE EVERY 6 MONTHS! \n\nManagement uses a utilization metric for each projects PM hours sold.  They fill our project list up with these projects until we get to 36 hours/week of utilization.  What management fails to understand is that every project is undersold on labor. Every. Single. One.  This creates the problem because our bonus is tied to our projects financial health, so we will never report the actual hours we use on the project.  We will use all the hours until there are no more, then stop reporting hours on that project.  It creates a windfall because you now look underutilized so they give you more projects, and the cycle repeats itself.  One of the main issues I have is that management insists we inform them of projects undersold and the hours allotted, blah blah, they will help to fix it....nah, they suddenly become deaf and mute. \n\nI do feel this is an anomaly at my current org as my previous employer in the AV industry didn't have this problem.  There problem was just the lack of resources they would give me, and the amount of work they expected me to do for the money they were paying wasn't justified.

Someone asks for “just 5 minutes” and from the outside it looks harmless. Non-dev folks (and honestly, sometimes PMs too) assume productivity drops for five minutes and then snaps right back to normal.\n\nBut the red line in this drawing is the real one. The meeting itself is short. The recovery is not.\n\nThat dip isn’t about the meeting content, it’s about context. You pull someone out of a mental model they’ve been building for an hour, maybe more. When they come back, they’re not picking up where they left off, they’re reconstructing. What was I doing? Why was I doing it this way? What was the next risky part? That rebuild time is invisible but it’s where most of the cost lives.\n\nWhat I find interesting is how this creates a quiet disconnect between roles. From a PM perspective, the calendar still looks efficient. Five minutes here, ten minutes there. From the team’s perspective, the day turns into a series of productivity cliffs. Nobody feels like they’re blocking work, yet work keeps slowing down.\n\nThe “just one task” version of this is even sneakier. A tiny request dropped into chat feels smaller than a meeting but it does the same damage. It fractures attention, then pretends nothing happened. Multiply that by a few times a day and suddenly people feel behind without being able to point to why.\n\nThis has made me rethink how I treat interruptions. Not in a “never talk to anyone” way but in a “is this worth resetting someone’s brain?” way. Because once you see productivity as a curve instead of a switch, a lot of normal PM behavior starts to look surprisingly expensive.\n\nHave you found ways to protect focus without turning into the PM who says “no” to everything? Or is this just one of those costs we all absorb and pretend isn’t there?",

No excuse for not being able to schedule a meeting two or three days ahead of time. Meetings cluster at the beginning of the day, before or after lunch, and at the end of the day. There are exceptions e.g. control gate presentations and true emergencies.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,   \n  \nI’m looking for advice on how to frame a past role in interviews, especially when interviewing with competitors in a small industry where informal reference checks are likely.\n\n  \n**Background**\n\nI joined as PM in mid-sized company whose core platform underpinned most client work, lets call this product X\n\nWhen joining I was assigned a bespoke, high-revenue project (Project A) for the biggest client of the company , that barely used Product X. I had a dedicated team and focused almost entirely on it. The project launched successfully and the client asked for further phases.\n\nAfter launch, I took on a second project (Project B) that ***was*** heavily dependent on Product X. At that point:\n\n* I had limited hands-on exposure to Product X\n* Only one senior engineer had deep platform knowledge\n* That engineer was frequently pulled onto other priorities\n\nI relied too much on the senior engineer’s confidence that work was “easy” and didn’t verify progress or escalate risk early enough. In the final weeks before launch, senior leadership had to step in, reallocate resources, and push hard to get it live. The Project B client was happy, but internally it was painful.\n\nAfter this:\n\n* The senior engineer was let go\n* I was put on a PIP\n* Despite completing the PIP, I was eventually let go\n\n  \nI **fully own** that I should have escalated risk earlier and relied on delivery evidence rather than reassurance. I’m trying to articulate that learning clearly and professionally, especially when interviewing within the same sector.\n\n**What I’m asking:**  \n  \nHow should I frame this experience honestly in interviews without oversharing?\n\n\n\n",

And the problem of \"unclear ownership\" where no one really \"owned\" master data or cross-department workflows is another unclear one. \n\nThis is actually why we now have to invest even more and talking to an external ERP advisory firm ([Leverage Technologies](https://www.leveragetech.com.au/solutions/erp/) through a referral) - not to re-implement, but to help untangle ownership, data standards, and cross-team workflows we clearly didn't plan for properly.\n\nEither way, I've seen this happen before in other companies - ERP projects will just fail due to poor planning, lack of training and not customizing enough. But what are the \"steps\" or must-dos for a proper and smooth transition? And when do you know for sure you have to adjust your approach mid-project?",

Your business processes, rules and workflows were not captured as part of those requirements.\n\nI had the luxury of working with a very gifted Senior Business Analyst on a large enterprise software change, when I hired the SBA I was just expecting some wireframes based upon user requirements. What I got was a fully constructed IT system requirements, data storage and flow requirements and business workflows all integrated into the technical design that were actually mapped back to use requirements. I got to ride on the coat tail of this exceptional work as the executive complimented the program because neither KPMG or Deloitte where able to achieve in what my SBA achieved. I essentially got schooled on how software development should be done and it's been one of my most important lessons as a project practitioner.\n\nMy SBA taught me an extremely valuable lesson about how to approach software development and how to capture technical and user requirements. The next major program I worked on I started to roll out the framework that my SBA had developed, and my program board literally said \"Are you shitting us?\", and all I said 'If you want it done properly, I have an example of how things should be done properly or do you want the program to fail?\". It was like watching the tumble weeds blow on through.\n\nI find most software projects fail because they don't drill down fair enough because a PM is not aware of how far to drill down or companies start thinking it's going to cost too much but fail to acknowledge on how much it actually costs when their implementation fails. It's why I bemuse when PM's in this reddit forum ask \"What software do you use?\" It's your business and user requirements will dictate what software to use and you find that out when you map your requirements to an application, not just spray and prey.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

The other success output of the program was to show how inefficient the team was operating as the program also optimised workflows which unexpected benefit realised but also allowed for cross training of staff because each staff member had built their own role and function within the team leaving the single points of failure, especially if someone was sick or on extended leave.\n\nOrganisations sometimes perceives planning a \"waste of time or an excessive cost\" and think just get building and we work from there. Taking the time to plan could turn out more cost effective than paying for all the things that go wrong with a bad deployment.",

You can't eliminate ALL surprises in advance, but that doesn't mean you just accept the vendor's word.

The program is currently approximately six months behind schedule, with an additional three to six months of delay likely.\n4. **Poor Documentation Practices** Documentation quality is low, with outdated content, weak version control, and insufficient maintenance as work is completed.\n5. **High Vendor Staff Turnover** Frequent vendor roll-offs have required repeated onboarding and retraining by internal teams, slowing progress and reducing efficiency.\n6. **Over-Reliance on External Contractors for Leadership** Key leadership responsibilities have shifted from internal staff to external contractors who will not be present post–go-live.\n7. **Ineffective Defect Resolution** Defect remediation during testing is slow due to poor documentation and low-quality deliverables, including inadequate unit testing by the vendor.\n8. **Ineffective Communications** Communications are neither timely nor comprehensive. Some team members were excluded from key communications for six months or more, with no effective remediation when escalated.\n9. **Reduced Internal Technical Capacity** Internal technical resources, particularly Business Analysts, were reduced by approximately 50% in the five years leading up to the implementation.\n10. **Late-Stage Data Issues** Data challenges were addressed late in the program lifecycle, resulting in avoidable rework and compounding downstream issues.",

              "text": "**Recommended Approach: What to Do Instead**\n\nBased on these observations, the following practices materially increase the likelihood of a successful ERP implementation:\n\n1. **Hire Experienced ERP Leadership** Appoint a full-time internal leader, even if you need to hire externally, with direct ERP transition experience to manage the program from vendor selection through go-live and stabilization.\n2. **Actively Manage the Vendor** If a vendor is engaged, manage strictly to contractual deliverables. Leverage and trust internal teams rather than defaulting to vendor control.\n3. **Enforce Financial Accountability** Missed vendor deliverables should result in financial consequences, as defined in the contract.\n4. **Prioritize High-Quality Documentation** Documentation must be complete, accurate, current, and well-versioned. While this requires significant effort, it is critical for long-term supportability and issue resolution years after go-live.\n5. **Minimize Vendor Turnover** Require continuity in vendor staffing or impose penalties for roll-offs tied to incomplete work.\n6. **Keep Leadership Internal** Program and workstream leadership roles should be filled by full-time employees with relevant experience to ensure continuity beyond go-live.\n7. **Maintain Continuous Testing Rigor** Testing outside formal test cycles should be nearly as rigorous as during planned cycles. The primary difference should be who executes the work (technical teams versus end users), not the quality standard.\n8. **Over-Communicate Consistently** Communicate broadly, frequently, and redundantly. Maintain accurate distribution lists and assume over-communication is preferable to missed communication.\n9. **Staff for Reality, Not Optimism** Accept that ERP transitions require temporary overstaffing—particularly in technical and business process roles. Organizations must sustain daily operations while executing significant transformation work. External support can help, but it cannot fully replace internal capacity.\n10. **Resolve Data Issues First** Address future-state data requirements at the outset. While tedious, this approach prevents extensive downstream rework in both data and code.\n\n \n\n**E**RP implementations are inherently stressful and complex. They do not merely replace technology platforms; they fundamentally reshape business processes across the organization. The upside is that these transformations typically occur once every decade or longer. Executed correctly, the investment in leadership, discipline, and fundamentals pays dividends long after the system goes live.(formatted with AI for readability)",

          "text": "When it comes to automate processes, my approach is to code Excel VBA prototypes to be used by people.   the key is to encapsulate Excel object management tasks.\n\nPrototyping little by little is far slower than just documenting processes and passing specs to TI. But allows a better dynamic understanding of processes.\n\nFor example, to find if a Workbook is opened I use a boolean function that is called GOTOWORKBOOK(name) where name is a fragment of the name of the workbook. So the whole line in the main program may look like IF GOTOWOKBOOK(\"Book1\") THEN so if the workbook is found, return TRUE and move to that workbook. Else, skip the instructions inside the IF block.\n\nTo write GOTOWORKBOOK function you can use ChatGPT.\n\nOnce you have all the needed generic functions, you can start programming. My experience is that if you encapsulate Excel object management code, you can reduce your main program to up to 20% of the size you would have if you write code from scratch.\n\nThe reason why it works is that by coding small VBA prototypes I learn about how data is managed by users. And if there is a need to change a process, you will find out quickly.  The trick is to be in the shoes of users while you code, as if you had to perform the task.\n\nIt is slower than making general documentation of processes but if you documented macros properly, you will be able to have the whole prototype as a collection of local prototypes with the form of local Excel VBA macros.\n\nThe problem with not prototyping is that you will see the flaws when you already coded the software and released it to the public.\n\nThe advantahe of Excel VBA code is that it allows to create local prototypes for specific users that will increase their productivity on live processes. If the macro fails, they can always go back to manual processing.\n\nVBA macros require Windows settings to be set as \"MM/DD/YYYY\" for short date and dot as decimal symbol. Anything different and macros will suffer weird errors. So when the macro runs, it verifies that and sends me an email if the machine does not have the proper configuration. And then I proactively call the user.  That surprises users because they expected the first chance to claim that the macro did not work so they could not change their ways of doing things.\n\nAlso when there is an error, I make the error handling at the main code, and it sends me an email with information to replicate the error. That way I am ahead of people complaints.",

I use a number of the things mentioned across this thread to keep myself (somewhat) sane, and this has been one of the most important ones. Especially as someone who mostly works remote. I have a standing calendar block at the end of each work day that’s just for final emails, closing out browser windows, finishing notes, making tomorrow’s list, and then writing out what I accomplished that day (even if it doesn’t feel like much, I often surprise myself with how much it actually is).\n\nSome other things that have been great (many mentioned in this thread):\n\nI set my priorities on a week-to-week basis, not day to day. I’ve found it’s better for me in hitting that sweet spot between staying clear on the long game and pushing through all the random tasks I gotta do. That priority list has 3 items max and only something major can change the order or what’s on it.\n\nI have a running master to-do list that I prioritize like a product backlog. But the only items marked “highest” should contribute to the week’s priorities. It always has at least 30-40 items on it (including some with a priority label that is essentially “probably never”), but I keep that master list in software so that I can easily just stay in filtered views.\n\nFinally, idk if this is applicable for you, but what me helps the most when I get overwhelmed is to remember my actual role is different from my job title. My title is project coordinator, but my most important role is to protect the time and ability of my team to do great work. I focus on my real role and a never ending to-do list becomes easier to ignore. Random stuff that will probably never get done exists on my list so it won’t exist on theirs - and that is a win in itself I can take pride in.",

I can say this because I’m 73 years old and lived through your pain and stress. But here’s how to overcome overwhelm:\n\nNot everything on your list is a top priority. It may seem like it, but you’ll never grow and excel at your career unless you learn how to prioritize the important stuff and ignore the rest. So, how do you know what’s a top priority?\n\nFirst, go through your tasks and decide which ones are urgent and important. And remember; not all urgent tasks are important. Important tasks affect the project success factors like cost, schedule, and quality. Important tasks also include things that increase your company’s profitability and are in your job description.\n\nYou don’t need fancy technology to manage your todo list either. I was in the construction industry for 45+ years, 25 as a construction manager, and used a paper planner most of my work life. And I was always on top of my projects. Here’s what I did…\n\nSit down before you go to bed each night and write down the three top priority tasks you need to complete tomorrow. Yes, I said three. And focus only on those tasks until they are finished or you can’t go any further without information someone else needs to provide.\n\nThen, write down other tasks that you’ll get to after you’ve finished your top three tasks. But learn to ‘procrastinate’ on the tasks that are urgent and not important. They are a waste of time.\n\nAt 73, I still plan my days like this. I’m focused on creating an online course for aspiring construction managers, and I can’t afford to waste my remaining years on trivial crap. I have a lot to pass on to the next generation of construction managers. That’s the reason God keeps me around and gave me such a fantastic career.\n\nTry my system. It works.\n\nBest, Father Time",

You’ve identified and finished your most important task.\n\nWhen you start off reading emails, you are letting other people drive your day. You’ll probably get sidetracked with the, “I’m just going to answer these couple of emails,” and you’ve done two things that are productivity busters:\n\n1. If they are just quick responses to someone else’s email, then they aren’t important. Take an hour later in the day to batch your email, responding using your 4-D’s.\n\n2. All humans only have so much brain power each day. That’s why we’re so tired at the end of the day. Work has sucked the energy out of our brains. That’s why we need sleep at night. If you start your day processing email, you’ve wasted some of that precious brain energy on something that really has little to do with your productivity. And for every actionable email you read, there’s likely 6-10 that are not related to what you said you would do when planning your day the night before.\n\nDon’t believe me? There’s a book I highly recommend called, “Eat That Frog” by Brian Tracy that explains why you should tackle your highest priority and most difficult tasks first.\n\nBecause once you’ve ‘eaten the frog’, the rest of your day is easy.",

My approach has always been to stop worrying about the length of the backlog and start obsessing over the priority of the immediate tasks. I lean heavily on the Scrum mindset for this exact reason. My job isn't to do everything; it is to ensure the team is working on the absolute highest priority for today and that nothing is blocking them from finishing it.\n\nAlso, be careful that your list isn't growing because you are absorbing noise that should be filtered out. A never ending list is often a sign of scope creep. You have to be willing to protect the project boundaries and escalate issues rather than just adding them to your pile.

Ultimately everyone is a minority of one and different tools work for different people regardless of what categorizations may apply. No excuses. \n\nThere are lots of tools and methodologies to manage to-do. There are a few commonalities among the good ones. \n\n* You have to prioritize. Not everything is of equal importance. \n* Schedule and priority are not the same. \n* Whatever you choose and use, the system should be easy and fast to maintain. \n* Delegate.\n\nI use more than one tool. Outlook is the centerpiece since you can populate Tasks from email and calendar. It integrates with Teams and Slack. You can even set and update from Whatsapp with third party software. You'll be hard pressed to find any meaningful software that can't talk to Outlook. If you have some tool that doesn't talk to Outlook it likely doesn't talk to other equally important tools e.g. accounting and HRIS. \n\nI use Apple Reminders on my phone sometimes, mostly for short term to-dos that come from text messages. \n\nI always have a pad of 3x5 Post-It notes in my pocket. If all else fails I take notes there. This is especially helpful if I have to sketch something or block out an architecture or a workflow. \n\nNot really a tool but a great story - right people in the right place at the right time generated a bunch of drawings on cocktail napkins. Those are part of a patent in USPTO. Lesson: perfect is the enemy of good enough. \n\nLearn how to use file references to local and shared storage e.g. file:///H:/ProjA/PM/DetDesign/Risk.xlsx so you can click on the reference and the document opens. This is time efficient, reduces errors, ties into version control, and ties into document management. \n\nIf you're mentally blocked on something move on to something else and get back to it.",

A financial breakdown \n   * Clear forecast figures \n   * Clear acutals figures (this is extremely important to ensure that you don't throw any dead cats here)\n4. Project objectives and benefits (this one may sound odd but I see this get lost in translation all the time)\n5. Key project stakeholder roles and responsibilities e.g. the go to people like architect, project board and who makes good coffee, the important project relationships.  \n\nWhen it comes to project documentation artifacts I like to be organised (some people have been known to say anal retentive) so when it comes to handover I'm confident that the newly incumbent PM has everything they need, the synopsis document is just a quick reference guide only and it's generally no longer than a two pager document because things start getting lost in translation. \n\nThe key thing to remember as a professional courtesy is to make yourself available during the transitional period, I have lost count on how many times if seen PM's cut and run from a project that they knew that was a dead cat and to be honest it annoys the hell out of me because they would be the first to complain if it happens to them. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

That’s usually how you end up overloaded again.\n\nWhat’s worked best for me is dividing based on **complexity and decision load**, not volume. A few practical ways to think about it:\n\n* **Type of work, not count** Some projects are execution-heavy but predictable. Others are small on paper but full of ambiguity, stakeholders, and decisions. Balance those across PMs.\n* **Lifecycle split (if it fits)** One PM focuses more on front-end work (initiation, scoping, planning, approvals), the other on delivery and close-out. This only works if handovers are clean and decision and accountability are clear.\n* **Stakeholder intensity** Projects with high exec visibility, political risk, or lots of external parties take more PM energy. Don’t stack all of those on one person.\n* **Skill and context fit** If one PM has stronger technical depth and the other is better with change, comms, or vendors, lean into that. Forcing symmetry usually creates friction.\n* **Capacity review, not a one-off split** Make it explicit that allocation gets reviewed monthly or quarterly. Projects change shape, and static splits cause drift.\n\nThe biggest mistake I see is treating PM capacity like a spreadsheet problem. It’s really about **where decisions and uncertainty sit**. Balance *that*, and the workload tends to even out naturally.\n\nHope that helps.",

That said, the clients I’m working with so far seem genuinely nice and reasonable, which definitely helps.\n\nIn the role, I’m responsible for overseeing multiple projects for our company’s largest client, and it’s very client facing. A big part of my time is spent working directly with the client, managing expectations, aligning on priorities, and translating client needs into clear actions for delivery teams.\n\nWe also work closely with a key third party partner who handles most of the hands on execution. My role sits in the middle, acting as a bridge between the client and the external consultants, making sure timelines, dependencies, risks, and deliverables stay on track.\n\nBut yeah, so far, the focus feels very much on coordination, prioritisation, communication, and delivery oversight.\n\nA few things I’d love advice on:\n\n* What separates an average project manager from a good one in a heavily client facing role like this?\n* how do you handle situations where a client gets upset or frustrated? Any practical tips for de escalating and managing those conversations without damaging the relationship?\n* What habits, frameworks, or tools should I build early to avoid becoming just a “to do list manager”?\n* For those who moved from consulting into PM, how did you make the role feel more strategic and impactful?\n* Longer term, is this type of PM and client management experience viewed positively career wise?\n\nThanks :)",

If you end up in a role that you are managing vendors, you have insight into how that world works as well.  \nClear, open, and honest communication are great. Bad news does not age well, share challenges and risks asap to address and develop mitigations.  \nUnder promise and over deliver. Always have a 5-10% contingency that you don't share with the client to account for emergencies. It allows you to almost always be on time. Please note, that when you go beyond a 10% contingency you can be accused of sandbagging a client. Imagine if you complete on a Monday vs Wednesday deliverable is great, but not 1st of the month delivery vs end of month delivery. One gives reasonable slack to account for illness/delays, the other slows the project down by breaking the schedule.\n\nDeescalation of client often involves getting them to describe the problem, you reformat and repeat back the problem in your own words to ensure understanding, then ask them what a reasonable solution to the issue is. You ask for their solution first to anchor expectations. If its doable, do it. If its unreasonable, offer reasonable or workable solutions.",

(just some place to write the worked hours so we can bill it to the clients). Normally other consultants that manage developers work just use a Doc or and Excel to write things down, and have mostly everything in their heads.\n\nI've just started using Jira, multiple kanban dashboards and backlogs to keep everything written down, and I assign tickets with as much context as I can to developers, sometimes to devs outside of my small team (4 devs + me for 5 or 6 different projects)\n\nBut, between the meetings with clients, devs calling for help, sometimes developing myself and designing software architecture, I find myself I don't have that much time to maintain the jira, to read every update on every ticket... Much less to really plan and keep track of the projects, segment the work in smaller bits to delegate to other devs outside of my small team.\n\nI want to ask for more resources, but I barelly have time to manage the ones I have (on top of managing the projects).\n\nSimeone more experienced, have some advice? Would be apreciated, thanks",
