Some even deleted without reading it. \n\nDoes anyone else just presume no one is going to read their emails but still send them anyway? What's your preferred way to get general information to people, weekly cadence with all participants? smaller communications with active participants and only general updates to larger group less frequently?

Everyone will stop looking at your and stop paying attention. All eyes will immediately drop, the person will become disengaged, and they will block you out and will read what you just put in front of them. If Bezos did that the garbage about making them read for 30 minutes is nothing more than trying to clean up a mess he created.\n\n30 minutes of reading time is ten pages, not a \"brief/memo/report.\"\n\nI don't let these situations happen. I send out the agenda beforehand and team members review and bring that agenda to the meeting (they can add agenda items if they want beforehand). We immediately talk about the agenda items, no Kabuki theater or special dances. Reviewing and bringing the agenda to the meeting is a standard, not a suggestion. The first meeting I ever ran I did hand out agendas first and watched every face immediately ignore me and drop to read the sheet I just put in front of them. I figured it out in about two seconds. Now it's no longer a problem.",

That forces a habit that creates your frustration when you do have something important to convey. A few things I would suggest that may help:  \n1) Think about why you want to communicate in the first place. What is the use/outcome for your audience?  \n2) What channel is most acceptable to the audience you need to reach?  \n3) What is the urgency of the communication?\n\nOften through these questions you can do a few thing:  \n1) Tailor the communication so it is more valuable.   \n2) Reach a smaller audience so the communication is targeted to who needs to receive it.   \n3) Use a channel that will be consulted.   \n4) Use a channel that matches the urgency of the communication. \n\nHappy to chat further if that isn't helpful.",

Then when they merge, it runs through all of our automated tests and if it passes, we have a release manager interface where they can promote it through to staging then production just by clicking buttons. And if they need to rollback they just click a button as well. So the full pipeline can be managed by non-technical engineers. \n\n2. For more rapid feature dev and experiments we can use replit, v0, figma make and easily build apps on top of our existing APIs and deploy them via the same release manager, and they can all exist inside our main app domain alongside our core apps. All without needing to involve the core “engineering” team. \n\nWe basically restructured our infrastructure and tooling to allow anyone in the business to work on and release features and apps, and created a base layer of context and resources that allow them to get up and running really fast.",

Those are things you can control. With your team, delegate tasks that should be theirs to do and they're just being lazy about it. If it's directly related to the project paperwork then yes that's on you. But if it's stuff related to what your implementation or developer person needs to be doing then make them do it. Idk your background prior to being a PM, but for me I was in IT doing helpdesk to field tech to manager. So yes I can do the IT stuff but in my role as a PM I'm not going to because we have ppl for that role.\n\nFor your bosses, let them know that you're at your max capacity for projects and they need to hire another PM or they need to divide the work load better. If after directly telling them there is no change definitely start looking for other roles and leave that place in your rearview. Make sure to block out admin time for yourself on your calendar so you don't have meetings stack up.

It's very difficult to set those boundaries because ultimately, I am the face of the program and the blowback will be on me when we miss our milestones. I also feel for them because I know they're burning out too, it doesn't necessarily come from them just being lazy. \n\nI will say though that most of my stress comes from just having too much on my plate. The entry level PM they hired for me to delegate tasks to isn't up to the task yet, and she's been here six months already.

Do your admin work while \"attending\" the meeting unless you actively have to present or engage but if you're usually just sitting in on it, do other stuff.

She can't learn unless you teach so give her stuff to do with the guidance on where to look for resources, if she can't handle it then she should move on to another career field and you hire someone who can help.",

As an example back when I was an advanced PM and I had been allocated 18 active projects of various sizes and complexity, I was literally running from meeting to meeting all day and my administration work day didn't really start until about 4:30-5:00pm.  A colleague pointed this out to me because I just thought this was the norm, I escalated to the Program and Account Director my problem, long story short my workload was reduced to 8 projects with the client approval and priority, it taught me a very valuable lesson about my utilisation rate and understanding my capacity to manage it.

The reason for us isn't because of the tasks, it's because of the amount of tasks they have made so much harder due to the requirement to use our internal system that takes a rocket scientist to figure out.  No joke, I hear this from the team that trains us on this software, \"this streamlines the process and makes it so much easier and faster.\"  That would be true IF I DID THAT F'ING PROCESS EVERY DAY ALL DAY! I ONLY NEED TO USE THIS F'ING THING ONCE EVERY 6 MONTHS! \n\nManagement uses a utilization metric for each projects PM hours sold.  They fill our project list up with these projects until we get to 36 hours/week of utilization.  What management fails to understand is that every project is undersold on labor. Every. Single. One.  This creates the problem because our bonus is tied to our projects financial health, so we will never report the actual hours we use on the project.  We will use all the hours until there are no more, then stop reporting hours on that project.  It creates a windfall because you now look underutilized so they give you more projects, and the cycle repeats itself.  One of the main issues I have is that management insists we inform them of projects undersold and the hours allotted, blah blah, they will help to fix it....nah, they suddenly become deaf and mute. \n\nI do feel this is an anomaly at my current org as my previous employer in the AV industry didn't have this problem.  There problem was just the lack of resources they would give me, and the amount of work they expected me to do for the money they were paying wasn't justified.  But it was less stressful than my current org.\n\n/rant\n\n  \nOP - I feel your pain. I have no words of wisdom or advice, but I'll cry along with you if it helps",

Do you have someone you can talk to?\n\nWhat you’re describing doesn’t sound unusual, but that doesn’t mean it’s healthy. \n\nIt may be controversial but working 45–50-60 hours or even more isn’t extreme in a project space **(doesnt mean its right)**, but working at full cognitive load all day, every day, with no pauses, is brutal. You need time for lunch and to think.\n\n**That’s not about hours — that’s about sustained pressure.**\n\nThe first step isn’t endurance. It’s clarity. \n\n* What are you explicitly accountable for? \n* What are you absorbing because no one else owns it? \n* Who actually has the authority to reduce scope, not just reshuffle it?\n\nIf those answers are fuzzy, no certification or role change will feel better — the pattern will just repeat somewhere else.\n\nIn my experience, PM roles become crushing when responsibility keeps expanding but authority and accountability doesn’t. You end up carrying the work, the client emotion, and the consequences, without being able to slow anything down or reset expectations.\n\nThat doesn’t mean *all* PM jobs are like this. But some environments absolutely are — especially client-driven, regulated ones where urgency never switches off and “capacity” is theoretical. Its tough!\n\nA PMP won’t fix that by itself. It can help you move, but the bigger question for your next role is whether the organisation actually manages workload and decision ownership, or whether PMs are just expected to absorb everything.\n\nI wouldn’t assume you’re weak or that PM just “*crushes souls*”. I’d be asking whether the system you’re in is sustainable for anyone long-term.\n\nHappy to share what my workload has looked like over time *(its not pretty)* — but I’m more interested in whether you have some support, or just being told to cope.",

Pay attention to things like which projects and operations initiatives get funded vs don't, what executives ask about vs ignore, metrics that impact decisions, and where risk is accepted vs addressed.  \n\nLearn how to frame things in business language, instead of project management language.  This can be hard when you've poured the PMBOK Guide into your brain, but execs rarely speak in PMBOK.  They speak in terms of tradeoffs, impacts, and outcomes.  The concepts can be similar but they get expressed differently.\n\nIf you can find a mentor at your company it could prove helpful.  You can also check if your local PMI chapter has a mentorship program, but it's hard to say if they'd have a mentor for business acumen.\n\nI pursued my MBA early in my career, which helped expose me to a lot of the concepts.  One of the challenges, however, was that I was too junior and wasn't exposed to how they were applied at work.  That took time and experience.  Once you start intentionally learning business acumen, begin intentionally applying it as well.  Examine your projects and ask:\n\n* What does this project enable, protect, or reduce?\n* What happens if we don't do it?\n* What is the cost of delay?\n* Who benefits?  How?\n\n...and build decision-feedback loops into your decisions:\n\n* Make a decision\n* Write down your assumptions and expected outcomes\n* Once the outcomes are known, ask yourself, \"What did I miss?\"\n* Evaluate why you missed it and what you can learn from the experience\n\nWash, rinse, repeat - this will help you develop pattern recognition while refining important skills.",

                  "text": "Org behaviour is an extremely broad subject because you need to take into consideration individuals, teams and organisations as a whole. Key concepts are as follows: \n\n**Individual behaviours -** you need to understand what motivates and drives individuals and how their personal traits, values attitude influence their behaviour and is the most complex to understand because you start taking on basic psychology understanding. \n\nA good place to start is finding out if people are generally intrinsically or extrinsically valued and some project practitioners may agree or disagree and use some psueudosience principles such the the Myers Briggs 16 personality types and how they interact within the team and organisation. Also the DISC Theorem which is based upon 4 personality types (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and Conscientious) and how it influences team building dynamics. The last is the Alan Tuckman’s stages of group development (forming, storming, norming, performing) model. These are all starting points for your consideration and I have found the extremely useful when trying to understand project performance delivery. Is it bullet proof, no but it provides insights to common individual and corporate behaviour. \n\n**Group dynamics -** you need to study on how people interact within the team, how they communicate, how and who leads and the most important is conflict resolution and how they approach that. This comes down to observation and leading back to individual behaviour and how they influence group dynamics particularly those disruptors within a team, the key is to understand their motivation. \n\n**Organisational culture -** It’s the tone that the organisation sets, what values and beliefs and practices it has and how it shapes organisational policy and how it behaves. But most importantly on how it impacts employees. \n\nThe reason on why Org Behaviour needs to be understood by project practitioners because it facilitates understanding, performance and the most important thing that it facilitates is change. \n\nJust a spitball on a very broad subject and if you want to become a great PM, this is the very reason on why EQ skills are extremely important as a project practitioner. I hope that gives you a bit of insight. ",

Someone asks for “just 5 minutes” and from the outside it looks harmless. Non-dev folks (and honestly, sometimes PMs too) assume productivity drops for five minutes and then snaps right back to normal.\n\nBut the red line in this drawing is the real one. The meeting itself is short. The recovery is not.\n\nThat dip isn’t about the meeting content, it’s about context. You pull someone out of a mental model they’ve been building for an hour, maybe more. When they come back, they’re not picking up where they left off, they’re reconstructing. What was I doing? Why was I doing it this way? What was the next risky part? That rebuild time is invisible but it’s where most of the cost lives.\n\nWhat I find interesting is how this creates a quiet disconnect between roles. From a PM perspective, the calendar still looks efficient. Five minutes here, ten minutes there. From the team’s perspective, the day turns into a series of productivity cliffs. Nobody feels like they’re blocking work, yet work keeps slowing down.\n\nThe “just one task” version of this is even sneakier. A tiny request dropped into chat feels smaller than a meeting but it does the same damage. It fractures attention, then pretends nothing happened. Multiply that by a few times a day and suddenly people feel behind without being able to point to why.\n\nThis has made me rethink how I treat interruptions. Not in a “never talk to anyone” way but in a “is this worth resetting someone’s brain?” way. Because once you see productivity as a curve instead of a switch, a lot of normal PM behavior starts to look surprisingly expensive.\n\nHave you found ways to protect focus without turning into the PM who says “no” to everything? Or is this just one of those costs we all absorb and pretend isn’t there?",

In high-performing orgs, a strong sponsor and a solid business case are required to even enter intake. Sponsors do the homework because capacity is a strategic asset to protect, not something to squander. Half-baked ideas don’t make it to the meeting.\n\nMost places aren’t there. Projects get green-lit on napkin-math, then PMs and SMEs are told to “figure it out,” which creates resource conflicts, stuttered starts, and overruns.\n\n**My workaround:** have the PM build the brief (charter) as **living controls**, not a static doc:\n\n* **In/Out-of-Scope matrix** to keep change in check and feed into **Mobilization**\n* **RAID log**, reviewed weekly with clear escalation paths and audits\n* **Financial breakdown** (what we’ll spend, when) to surface variance early\n* **Guiding principles** to push decisions to where the work happens\n\nDo this and the PM shapes outcomes instead of playing order taker asking, “want fries with that?”",

      "text": "Hi everyone,   \n  \nI’m looking for advice on how to frame a past role in interviews, especially when interviewing with competitors in a small industry where informal reference checks are likely.\n\n  \n**Background**\n\nI joined as PM in mid-sized company whose core platform underpinned most client work, lets call this product X\n\nWhen joining I was assigned a bespoke, high-revenue project (Project A) for the biggest client of the company , that barely used Product X. I had a dedicated team and focused almost entirely on it. The project launched successfully and the client asked for further phases.\n\nAfter launch, I took on a second project (Project B) that ***was*** heavily dependent on Product X. At that point:\n\n* I had limited hands-on exposure to Product X\n* Only one senior engineer had deep platform knowledge\n* That engineer was frequently pulled onto other priorities\n\nI relied too much on the senior engineer’s confidence that work was “easy” and didn’t verify progress or escalate risk early enough. In the final weeks before launch, senior leadership had to step in, reallocate resources, and push hard to get it live. The Project B client was happy, but internally it was painful.\n\nAfter this:\n\n* The senior engineer was let go\n* I was put on a PIP\n* Despite completing the PIP, I was eventually let go\n\n  \nI **fully own** that I should have escalated risk earlier and relied on delivery evidence rather than reassurance. I’m trying to articulate that learning clearly and professionally, especially when interviewing within the same sector.\n\n**What I’m asking:**  \n  \nHow should I frame this experience honestly in interviews without oversharing?\n\n\n\n",

It is great for PDUs (continuing education) and if you want to develop more skills there are good resources. Also, It does give you access to a local chapter, which you may have additional fees to join. \n\nHowever, an employer won’t care that you’re a Member and unless you have the personality and location (major city) to network heavily, and even then, I don’t think you will see an ROI on it without a cert.\n\nIf you are looking for a new job, I do highly recommend getting your PMP. Most places I’ve worked for treat it has equal priority to a degree. Maybe look at scholarships for continuing education?

This is the process I've landed on after a few years of iterating, and it works well for me:\n\nI keep the big to-dos/things I need to keep an eye on listed on the first page of my physical notebook, organized by project, with a miscellaneous section at the bottom.  Next to each item is a square that I fill in to show progress.  If something's urgent/high risk, I use a red pen.  Each week, I start a new page.  This keeps me focused on what is in motion, helps me prioritize, and creates a high-level weekly record of my work, which is helpful for annual reviews/checkins.  \n\nSome of the tasks or deliverables above will also live on the project boards that I share with my teams and stakeholders.  Those boards have different filters, including \"all tasks\", \"what's left to do\", and \"what should be started or done this week\".  I keep an eye on these a few times a week to keep our teams on track.  \n\nFor personal notes in projects, I use simplenote.  It's the only notetaking app I could find for Windows that is lightweight, allows simple categorization of multiple notes, and (most importantly) can be sized very small while still being useful.  I dedicate a small portion of my screen so it's always open.  I use OneNote for home projects, but it's too bulky for my professional use and doesn't play well when sized down.  \n\nFor important notes that will be shared with others, or notes that will be pretty much archived once recorded, we just dump those in word and store them in SharePoint.",

They couldn't take it the wrong way and it wasn't personally and it was the impact of their choice because they didn't define their requirements properly. So their lack of planning didn't become my emergency but it's brilliant way to litmus test how genuine the change was or the client was just seeing if they could get away with it.",

There was basically no onboarding to the company’s software outside of HR portals, and everyone works through the weekends or late at night in addition to 9-5. When I asked about onboarding, people from other departments just joked — “Onboarding? What’s that?”\n\nI’ve also seen 2 people mysteriously laid off in the short time I’ve been here, and I think that shrinking the team is the last thing we need. It seems very top heavy too, where the staff in my city consists of the C-Suite, a handful of account and media managers , then me, the project manager. My entire morning is full of meetings most days.\n\nMy boss seems to think I can magically whip out a timeline, asking me day one. I built one out the best I could, but the issue is that the client keeps changing things, takes forever to approve, then demands updates and information immediately. I’ve communicated multiple times that I cannot finalize timelines or project documents due to missing information from coworkers who are too busy to respond because they’re overbooked.\n\nI’m doing the best I can, but this new job has made me feel so defeated. At my last agency, I felt capable — I had the best client rapport from my team and was heading our project ops seamlessly for the most part. Now I feel completely overwhelmed at times and that I’ve chosen the wrong title.\n\nIs this normal? How do I get through while i look for another job?",

By week 3 I knew it was a huge mistake, after being onboarded to 6 large, legacy clients in 5 days, and being told I was being expected to kick-off and manage 10 new projects.... all before my first 90 days. It has been beyond overwhelming, and they were not transparent at all about any of this during my interview process. This is supposed to be an Intermediate PM job, and only pays 70k CAD per year (which is less than 50k USD per year for context.) \n\nI am looking for a new job, but in the meantime: I have been VERY transparent and honest every week, flagging the same concerns and risks both in writing and vocally. I have also been open about this being completely unrealistic workload & meeting expectations. I even went as far to tell them that these expectations wouldn't be ok for even a Senior PM role. Nothing is really being done, but they can't blame anything on me if I am flagging everything. I am also not going above and beyond ... either. Because of my workload, I sometimes have client emails that have to go unread for a few days, I am not responding to every Slack the same day (some I never respond to because there is just too many), and I have had to push out meetings by a week or two (meaning a project timeline has to get pushed) because I don't simply have enough time to do everything in my paid working hours. I do my best, but I close my laptop on time every day and I never work a minute of OT. If something isn't done, it can wait until tomorrow, or next week, or a couple weeks. I also decline any & every meeting that goes past my work hours. \n\nI have had to really work at \"not caring so much\" over the last 3 months and, just doing as best I can .... but also being ok with things dropping and not getting stressed over it. I have to remind myself that the company's lack of resource planning and poor workload management is not my problem to solve, and I am not the issue here.",

Make assumptions visible, \n2. Tie dates to inputs you require but don’t control, and \n3. Stop owning client churn as personal failure.\n\nIs this normal in agencies? Unfortunately, yes in some. Is it how PM should feel everywhere? No. The fact you felt capable in your last role matters. Your ability didn’t disappear in three months. Will you need to work outside the 9-5 almost certainly. \n\nIf you’re looking elsewhere, I’d be paying attention to whether PMs actually get authority and accountability. Without that, the job just becomes pressure management.\n\n**You didn’t choose the wrong title. You landed in a messy system.**\n\nHope you're ok.",

              "text": "This! I’m also early career and have ADHD. I use a number of the things mentioned across this thread to keep myself (somewhat) sane, and this has been one of the most important ones. Especially as someone who mostly works remote. I have a standing calendar block at the end of each work day that’s just for final emails, closing out browser windows, finishing notes, making tomorrow’s list, and then writing out what I accomplished that day (even if it doesn’t feel like much, I often surprise myself with how much it actually is).\n\nSome other things that have been great (many mentioned in this thread):\n\nI set my priorities on a week-to-week basis, not day to day. I’ve found it’s better for me in hitting that sweet spot between staying clear on the long game and pushing through all the random tasks I gotta do. That priority list has 3 items max and only something major can change the order or what’s on it.\n\nI have a running master to-do list that I prioritize like a product backlog. But the only items marked “highest” should contribute to the week’s priorities. It always has at least 30-40 items on it (including some with a priority label that is essentially “probably never”), but I keep that master list in software so that I can easily just stay in filtered views.\n\nFinally, idk if this is applicable for you, but what me helps the most when I get overwhelmed is to remember my actual role is different from my job title. My title is project coordinator, but my most important role is to protect the time and ability of my team to do great work. I focus on my real role and a never ending to-do list becomes easier to ignore. Random stuff that will probably never get done exists on my list so it won’t exist on theirs - and that is a win in itself I can take pride in.",

          "text": "First of all, and I don’t want to sound morbid, but you will die someday with items on your todo list. I can say this because I’m 73 years old and lived through your pain and stress. But here’s how to overcome overwhelm:\n\nNot everything on your list is a top priority. It may seem like it, but you’ll never grow and excel at your career unless you learn how to prioritize the important stuff and ignore the rest. So, how do you know what’s a top priority?\n\nFirst, go through your tasks and decide which ones are urgent and important. And remember; not all urgent tasks are important. Important tasks affect the project success factors like cost, schedule, and quality. Important tasks also include things that increase your company’s profitability and are in your job description.\n\nYou don’t need fancy technology to manage your todo list either. I was in the construction industry for 45+ years, 25 as a construction manager, and used a paper planner most of my work life. And I was always on top of my projects. Here’s what I did…\n\nSit down before you go to bed each night and write down the three top priority tasks you need to complete tomorrow. Yes, I said three. And focus only on those tasks until they are finished or you can’t go any further without information someone else needs to provide.\n\nThen, write down other tasks that you’ll get to after you’ve finished your top three tasks. But learn to ‘procrastinate’ on the tasks that are urgent and not important. They are a waste of time.\n\nAt 73, I still plan my days like this. I’m focused on creating an online course for aspiring construction managers, and I can’t afford to waste my remaining years on trivial crap. I have a lot to pass on to the next generation of construction managers. That’s the reason God keeps me around and gave me such a fantastic career.\n\nTry my system. It works.\n\nBest, Father Time",

And reviewing your email ain’t one of them. Here’s why…\n\nIf you work on your highest priority activity that you identified from the night before and finish it, it’s a productivity and accomplishment rush. You’ve identified and finished your most important task.\n\nWhen you start off reading emails, you are letting other people drive your day. You’ll probably get sidetracked with the, “I’m just going to answer these couple of emails,” and you’ve done two things that are productivity busters:\n\n1. If they are just quick responses to someone else’s email, then they aren’t important. Take an hour later in the day to batch your email, responding using your 4-D’s.\n\n2. All humans only have so much brain power each day. That’s why we’re so tired at the end of the day. Work has sucked the energy out of our brains. That’s why we need sleep at night. If you start your day processing email, you’ve wasted some of that precious brain energy on something that really has little to do with your productivity. And for every actionable email you read, there’s likely 6-10 that are not related to what you said you would do when planning your day the night before.\n\nDon’t believe me? There’s a book I highly recommend called, “Eat That Frog” by Brian Tracy that explains why you should tackle your highest priority and most difficult tasks first.\n\nBecause once you’ve ‘eaten the frog’, the rest of your day is easy.",

The secret to surviving this career without burning out is realizing that the goal isn't to complete the list, but to ruthlessly prioritize it.\n\nIf you treat every item as equally important, you will drown. My approach has always been to stop worrying about the length of the backlog and start obsessing over the priority of the immediate tasks. I lean heavily on the Scrum mindset for this exact reason. My job isn't to do everything; it is to ensure the team is working on the absolute highest priority for today and that nothing is blocking them from finishing it.\n\nAlso, be careful that your list isn't growing because you are absorbing noise that should be filtered out. A never ending list is often a sign of scope creep. You have to be willing to protect the project boundaries and escalate issues rather than just adding them to your pile. Peace of mind doesn't come from finishing the work, because there is always more work, it comes from knowing that the work you are doing today is the most critical thing for the project's success.",

Ultimately everyone is a minority of one and different tools work for different people regardless of what categorizations may apply. No excuses. \n\nThere are lots of tools and methodologies to manage to-do. There are a few commonalities among the good ones. \n\n* You have to prioritize. Not everything is of equal importance. \n* Schedule and priority are not the same. \n* Whatever you choose and use, the system should be easy and fast to maintain. \n* Delegate.\n\nI use more than one tool. Outlook is the centerpiece since you can populate Tasks from email and calendar. It integrates with Teams and Slack. You can even set and update from Whatsapp with third party software. You'll be hard pressed to find any meaningful software that can't talk to Outlook. If you have some tool that doesn't talk to Outlook it likely doesn't talk to other equally important tools e.g. accounting and HRIS. \n\nI use Apple Reminders on my phone sometimes, mostly for short term to-dos that come from text messages. \n\nI always have a pad of 3x5 Post-It notes in my pocket. If all else fails I take notes there. This is especially helpful if I have to sketch something or block out an architecture or a workflow. \n\nNot really a tool but a great story - right people in the right place at the right time generated a bunch of drawings on cocktail napkins. Those are part of a patent in USPTO. Lesson: perfect is the enemy of good enough. \n\nLearn how to use file references to local and shared storage e.g. file:///H:/ProjA/PM/DetDesign/Risk.xlsx so you can click on the reference and the document opens. This is time efficient, reduces errors, ties into version control, and ties into document management. \n\nIf you're mentally blocked on something move on to something else and get back to it.",

He asked for some napkins and duct tape. He patched himself up and went right back to work. He had no back up plan for falling behind schedule on the project. The contingency was keep working no matter what until it’s done.\n\nAnother time, I was working my way cross country on a motorcycle and I needed some money so I stopped in a town to camp and got a job that day doing dishes. The guy I worked with in the dish pit for those couple weeks was the happiest guy I ever met. He was a migrant from Ecuador. No amount of slop and mud could get him down. I was miserable. I asked him his secret. He told me that this was only one of three jobs he had washing dishes. He worked 7 days a week 12 to 18 hours a day. He was happy to do it because he was putting two kids through college and he knew they would never have to migrate to a different country to wash dishes to provide a better life for themselves. \n\nI highlight these experiences because whenever I see the current generations use words like traumatic when describing their high paying office jobs I assume they have zero perspective on what life could have been like for themselves had they zigged when they should have zagged.",

Reasonable people, decent data, good intentions. And yet… things still unraveled.\n\nWhat stood out to me is how early a lot of those decisions were locked in.\n\nWe talk endlessly about what decision was made. Feature A vs B. This market vs that one. This metric vs another. But we rarely talk about when the decision was made and whether the situation had actually settled enough to justify certainty.\n\nIn practice, early certainty feels productive. It gives teams something solid to rally around. It reduces anxiety. It makes planning easier. But it also freezes assumptions that haven’t had time to be challenged yet. Once something is decided, it quietly becomes expensive to question, even when new signals show up.\n\nI’ve seen teams spend months executing flawlessly on a direction that probably needed a few more uncomfortable weeks of ambiguity upfront. And by the time reality caught up, the cost of changing course felt higher than just pushing through and hoping for the best.\n\nIt makes me wonder whether timing is an underrated product skill. Knowing when to decide isn’t about confidence or boldness, it’s about sensing when the system has revealed enough of itself to make a decision that won’t age badly.\n\nHave you been burned more by bad decisions or by decisions that were simply made before the problem had fully shown itself?",

Working with the data you have to make decisions is something we do every day. \n\nThink about a simple transaction. Buying Steel for your project.  \nCompany 1. You have purchased from them for 10 years, and had less than \\~1% defect rate with consistent delivery on time.  \nCompany 2. You have purchased from for the last 10 years, but they are often 3-6 weeks late and have a defect rate of \\~3%.\n\nWhich would you choose if pricing is the same?\n\nCompany 1 seems like the safer choice, both from a quality and delivery perspective. So you choose company 1 for this project.\n\nBefore the steel ships there is now a 20% tariff on Canadian steel from company 1, where company 2 is US Based and would not have the tariff. \n\nYou made the best decision for the project based on the information available. You could have waited to make the order until later, but that would have added timeline risk. So in mitigating the timeline risk, you took on geopolitical risk that seemed smaller at the time. Small enough that even seasoned PM's would not have added it to a risk register.\n\nThe issue isn't that the decision was made too soon, or without enough information its that there is risk that can't be anticipated. Its called unknown unknowns and we deal with them everyday. If you think unknown unknowns are something you are immune to, I would point to 2020 and the pandemic. So many projects were impacted by something no one had on their radar.",

In addition it's not a great professional look either.  \n\nI always do a project synopses document (or snap shot) which is a general project overview and quick reference document which has the following as mandatory:  \n\n1. Overview \n   * Time \n   * Cost \n   * Scope\n   * deliverables \n   * Milestones\n   * Interdependencies \n2. The Top 5 lists  \n   * Top 5 Issues and Risks \n   * What is the immediate top 5 deliverables (e.g. what is next on the schedule that they need to concentrate on)\n   * Key stakeholders (majors only) \n3. A financial breakdown \n   * Clear forecast figures \n   * Clear acutals figures (this is extremely important to ensure that you don't throw any dead cats here)\n4. Project objectives and benefits (this one may sound odd but I see this get lost in translation all the time)\n5. Key project stakeholder roles and responsibilities e.g. the go to people like architect, project board and who makes good coffee, the important project relationships.  \n\nWhen it comes to project documentation artifacts I like to be organised (some people have been known to say anal retentive) so when it comes to handover I'm confident that the newly incumbent PM has everything they need, the synopsis document is just a quick reference guide only and it's generally no longer than a two pager document because things start getting lost in translation. \n\nThe key thing to remember as a professional courtesy is to make yourself available during the transitional period, I have lost count on how many times if seen PM's cut and run from a project that they knew that was a dead cat and to be honest it annoys the hell out of me because they would be the first to complain if it happens to them. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I’ve recently moved from a consulting role in financial services into a project management position, and I’m looking for advice on how to do this well.\n\nThis is my first ever project management role, so I’m feeling a bit anxious and out of my comfort zone. That said, the clients I’m working with so far seem genuinely nice and reasonable, which definitely helps.\n\nIn the role, I’m responsible for overseeing multiple projects for our company’s largest client, and it’s very client facing. A big part of my time is spent working directly with the client, managing expectations, aligning on priorities, and translating client needs into clear actions for delivery teams.\n\nWe also work closely with a key third party partner who handles most of the hands on execution. My role sits in the middle, acting as a bridge between the client and the external consultants, making sure timelines, dependencies, risks, and deliverables stay on track.\n\nBut yeah, so far, the focus feels very much on coordination, prioritisation, communication, and delivery oversight.\n\nA few things I’d love advice on:\n\n* What separates an average project manager from a good one in a heavily client facing role like this?\n* how do you handle situations where a client gets upset or frustrated? Any practical tips for de escalating and managing those conversations without damaging the relationship?\n* What habits, frameworks, or tools should I build early to avoid becoming just a “to do list manager”?\n* For those who moved from consulting into PM, how did you make the role feel more strategic and impactful?\n* Longer term, is this type of PM and client management experience viewed positively career wise?\n\nThanks :)",

          "text": "The things that separate the average PM from a really good one are: \n\n— being proactive in your communication, always being prepared for meetings \n\n— total honesty is your dealings with the teams and client. Any attempt at BSing an issue will destroy your credibility. If you don’t know the answer to a question or a concern, tell them that you will find out and give it a time box. \n\n— keeping on top of schedules and since you have a 3rd party doing a bunch of the work, keeping on top of all the resources assigned to do the work \n\n— having a good grounding in PM skills. I recommend a book by Harold Kerzner, Project Management: A Systems Approach to Planning, Scheduling, and Controlling. You don’t need the current edition. Find one at a used book store.",

          "text": "Sounds like you have a great role! Customer facing PM is always a great skill set as you are juggling internal and external teams. If you end up in a role that you are managing vendors, you have insight into how that world works as well.  \nClear, open, and honest communication are great. Bad news does not age well, share challenges and risks asap to address and develop mitigations.  \nUnder promise and over deliver. Always have a 5-10% contingency that you don't share with the client to account for emergencies. It allows you to almost always be on time. Please note, that when you go beyond a 10% contingency you can be accused of sandbagging a client. Imagine if you complete on a Monday vs Wednesday deliverable is great, but not 1st of the month delivery vs end of month delivery. One gives reasonable slack to account for illness/delays, the other slows the project down by breaking the schedule.\n\nDeescalation of client often involves getting them to describe the problem, you reformat and repeat back the problem in your own words to ensure understanding, then ask them what a reasonable solution to the issue is. You ask for their solution first to anchor expectations. If its doable, do it. If its unreasonable, offer reasonable or workable solutions.",

You are the communication hub between the stakeholders for your projects.\n\nAlso be mindful of people's time when it comes to communication. If there is a delay on a deliverable then they will need to know that the delay is there for their own planning, but if the reason for the delay is irrelevant then don't include it more than necessary. \n\nA good lesson from negotiation is to learn the difference between position(a specific stated solution to fullfil a need) and interest(the actual need) and try to apply that when solutions are being discussed.",
