Enrolled in a Project Management class for my grad school program.\n\nThis shit is so abstract that monks would have trouble wrapping their heads around it.\n\nSo jargon filled that it makes L R Hubbard's engram see dollar signs.\n\nAnd the class is so fucking bad that I am losing my goddamned mind.\n\nAlot of fill-in-the-blank tests with the blanks being \"oo, sorry, 'common ground' would be incorrect. what we wanted to hear was MIDDLE GROUND.\" OR SENTENCES WHERE I CAN ONLY GET THEM RIGHT IF I EITHER MEMORIZED THE BOOK OR LITERALLY HAVE THE MATERIAL OPEN IN FRONT OF ME, and then, whats the fucking point?!\n\nThis professor had 20 quizzes due by the third day of an asynchronous class. It took me all night. And by the end I was ripping my mouse apart and performing self harm on my skull. I feel like I have a concussion today.\n\nAND SHE HAS IN THE SYLLABUS A RECOMMENDATION TO JOIN THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE!\n\nIf that institute is all this? Burn it to the fucking ground.\n\n\"Kanban\" \"Project Requisitiion coordinator\" \"Scrum\" as if they fucking have ever played rugby, or even met a rugby player. \"SAFe\"\n\nThe definitions are so self-congratulatory and confident in it's own neccesity. \"Adaptable, also known as Agile methodologies, allow for quick changes and...\" \"But Predictive models also do well in..\" \"But HYBRID models combine the best of both of them\" woooooo WHO WOULD HAVE FUCKING THOUGHT THAT NOT BEING STUCK IN ONE WAY OF THINKING WAS THE FUCKING POINT.\n\nDecision trees\n\nKanban Board Owners\n\nSTAKEHOLDERS. FUCKING STAKEHOLDERS. I CANT EVEN.\n\nI AM DONE. GODDAMN IT I AM DONE. I AM SO FUCKING DONE. I AM DONE. I WANT TO FUCKING CRY\n\nThere is not a genuine human emotion in this class, I feel like I was traumatized by the 80s man from Futurama. I'm vacillating between rage and wanting to cry.\n\nI'm sorry guys. I tried. But fuck project management.\n\nEDIT: Part of my rage could also be that she requires us to get a Chat GPT account, and my resolution for the year was to not use AI ",

I don't know what your degree is in, but if you're anywhere adjacent to corporate America you'll run into a lot of it anyways because you're almost certain to \\*work\\* with PMs.\n\nAll the people telling you you'll never use most of it as a PM are wrong. Am I trotting out PERT charts on a regular basis? Nope. Have I needed to because some exec thought it was \\*ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO BE SUCCESSFUL\\*...yes. If I didn't know what a PERT chart was it would have been hard to recover that relationship.\n\n Did I get an absolutely insane and guaranteed to fail project canceled once because I was able to sit down with the CFO and walk them through a Monte Carlo simulation of possible outcomes, where \"bankrupting the company due to fines and legal fees\" was more likely than \"meeting all objectives\"? Also yes.\n\nExactly once in my two decade+ career for both of those tools.\n\nYou're being shown a toolbox full of tools. Some are going to sit on the bottom of that toolbox 99% of the time. Knowing what and when to pull out the right tool is key. KNowing what all the tools and what they do is where that starts.\n\nAll the tools and jargon in the world are useless if you don't know how to use them and don't have the soft skills that are the core competencies for PMs...but if somebody says \"can you put a slide together showing the critical path as a GANTT chart, with annotations showing the key cross workstream dependencies and significant risks so we can share it with the executive stakeholders,\" you had better be able to parse it.",

I have an undergraduate in electrical engineering and I work as a test engineer in manufacturing. \n\nMy EE GPA was 2.14. I had a rough time in college and I will probably never go back for a masters. \n\nMy Grade for the 3 semesters of PM courses?  100% each semester. \n\nPM makes a lot of sense once you’ve worked on projects and have seen the tools in use. Once you’ve seen the pain points and what the tools are used for, they make sense and when you learn about them in class it is just putting a name to something that feels very obvious. \n\nWhat I saw in that class was that not all PM are engineers, but all engineers understand PM. We are trained to do it starting in college and continuing in industry.  It is more common for engineers to manage their own projects than for a project to get a PM assigned to it. \n\nIf PM doesn’t make sense to you, it is because you haven’t worked on enough projects. Those people who “are efficiently organized” or are “good at time/team management” are using PM techniques without realizing it. \n\nWhen I took that course, I wasn’t learning anything new, I was learning the names of the things I already knew and how to communicate with those who made decisions. The jargon is simply an agreed upon language that allows us to communicate and stay on the same page.",

Summer of 2023: Said fuck it, buckled down and found a self-paced study guide with practice tests to prepare for the PMP 4 hour exam. Killed myself memorizing as much as I could. Didn't care anymore about understanding since I had very little real world application. I was simultaneously beginning a Masters in CIS with a concentration in PM, which gave me credits needed to take PMI exam. \\*You have to have pm experience to even take it.\n5.

As a PM who has dealt with IT projects in the 8 figure range and deals with the C suite on a regular basis, words matter (a lot) and middle ground and common ground are different things and i would never use either of those terms interchangeably.  \n\nif I am talking about middle ground I would be speaking where there needs to be some give and take.  Possibly an issue where the Cyber Team is stating something must be done 1 way and the \"boots on the ground\" are stating that such a configuration won't work in practical terms.  As the manager of that issue I would need to find \"middle ground\", one where each side can compromise on their stand.  The output of that would be a \"common ground\", which is an understanding of the situation and agreed upon and documented path forward.",

Use your leverage to get er done. \n\nAll the other fancy jargon with kanban boards and ishigawa charts doesn’t matter unless you’re required by your company’s policy. \n\nProject managing reminds me of the old Wild West when there were good Marshall’s out there upholding the law cause they believe in it, as opposed to the bad ones who make it look easy. \n\nGotta be a people person, problem solve and communicate. Can’t do that? You might not be in it for long.",

But the role they play can vary WIDELY depending on the industry, company size, etc., so classes that try to scale to the full scope of this profession often feel super jargon-heavy and disconnected just like you’re describing. That was one of my biggest pain points with the PMP and I had to learn to study for the test without getting too hung up on real-life application. I know that’s a solution is also pretty frustrating, but it’s the only way I could preserve my sanity in a courses that try to be broad enough to capture everything so it ends up feeling like it teaches you nothing…. Does that make sense?",

They were either more complicated than necessary or out of date.  It made me wonder how long it had been since the instructors had worked as project managers, if the instructors had ever done more than teach project management.  One was teaching a book he had written that he was trying to promote to businesses as a new approach to use for estimating.  I hadn't heard of it before.  I haven't heard of it since.\n\nIt sounds like your teacher may have made the same mistake with her project management class that many leaders make when it comes to the projects they pursue - effectively communicating why it's needed, the problems it solves, and the benefits of pursuing it in a way that is meaningful to those involved.  Those three things might sound like I'm saying the same thing, but that would be like saying the colors scarlet and crimson are the same as the color red.\n\nIt doesn't help that project managers speak their own language which, in many cases is not even the same language business leaders speak.  There's some overlap, but it's heavily project and execution focused - more tactical than strategic.  Pardon me, it's more about how we get s4!t done, not why we're doing it in the first place.\n\nIt could actually be a good thing that your instructor is including AI in the course.  I won't say it's everywhere, but it's out there, available, and used by a lot of different roles, not just project managers, in tech and business related fields.  You might be able to choose to not use it after you graduate.  Maybe.",

A few weeks of getting yelled at and doing ridiculous activities.\n\nThe cert gives you a ticket for the ride.\n\nPM’ing in real life is nothing like what’s in the books. It’s like parenting books that try to explain why your 2yo will continue to wee in the dog’s water bowl.\n\nAnd yeah - membership is a cult. I left the AIPM (Australia) for similar reasons. I was paying $$$ a year to be a member and $$$$$$$ every few years to maintain a certification through shitty webinars.\n\nBut you are well on your way to being a PM. A key skill is being cynical AF, so consider yourself one of us already, ha ha",

In the Far East at least, dates are promises and breaking them destroys trust and clients' confidence in you. That's why most Japanese, Korean and Singaporean game companies never give public roadmaps, and US game companies would put out public roadmaps that changes every quarter.\n\nI am from the Far East, so I learned it the hard way when my western partner started with a too good to be true timeline and kept pushing the dates with foreseeable reasons. I'm not saying it doesn't make sense, I'm just saying that it has given me quite a bit of cultural shock.\n\nAnother thing I hate is how the Chinese and Indian companies seem to exploit the system by constantly starting with a shorter timeline and lower budget, and then ramping them up mid projects, especially Chinese construction and tech companies. This is why they can win the bids and keep the profits.",

Don't be a bully.\n\nCall me a romantic, but I believe that all these project methodologies and leadership frameworks we like are not in vain, they help diagnose and navigate problems. You just need to understand their purpose and what is applicable to your context. And the context, as you know, is messy, confusing, and cruel most times. But there is no silver bullet such as \"blame people all the time\".",

They are going far enough to give quarterly bonuses out to the most creative and beneficial uses people are able to find. Having hardly used even ChatGPT for a handful of prompts, and no formal training, I am finding it difficult to wrap my head around what use cases the AI is going to actually do for me in my day to day. Right now it feels like the wild west with a small team and everyone trying to establish an effective setup to have AI agents with context only to specific contracts, and also make it collaborative. We are primarily using CoPilot and Loop\n\n  \nWe have a proprietary website portal that has AI agents with context to things like contracts, service tickets, etc. We also still heavily live out of Office for documentation and Teams for meetings and storage. We're setting up individual Teams channels for individual contracts to provide but also limit context for AI agents. So far the biggest benefit has been utilizing Facilitator to recap our brainstorming sessions, create our minutes and assign tasks, and then also reference those to create first versions of SOP documentation. I can wrap my head around that - take a conversation and create helpful process documentation quickly. But, I'm having trouble thinking of more use cases that will actually benefit me. ",

          "text": "Honestly, the meeting recap and SOP drafting stuff you're already doing is probably the highest-value use case for most PMs. Don't feel like you need to force it into everything. That said, a few things I've found actually useful rather than gimmicky:\n\n\\*\\*Stakeholder communication drafts\\*\\* - Not for the final version, but when I need to write a difficult email (scope creep pushback, timeline slip notification, etc.) I'll dump in the context and ask for a first draft. Saves me from staring at a blank screen for 20 minutes. I rewrite maybe 60% of it, but it gets me moving. ChatGPT or claude or whatever for this.\n\n\\*\\*Risk brainstorming\\*\\* - When I'm doing risk identification for a new project, I'll describe the project and ask what risks I might be missing. It won't catch everything, but it's caught a few things I overlooked because I was too close to the work. I use [rezonant.app](http://rezonant.app) for this.\n\n\\*\\*Translating technical stuff\\*\\* - When engineering gives me something dense and I need to explain it to business stakeholders, I'll use it to help simplify without losing accuracy (use Rezonant for this as well)\n\n\\*\\*Meeting prep questions\\*\\* - Before a kickoff or discovery session, I'll have it generate questions I should be asking. Again, not using them verbatim, but it jogs my thinking. ChatGPT or your LLM of choice for this.\n\nThe \"automate ourselves out of jobs\" worry is overblown for PMs specifically. The job (if you do it well) is fundamentally about relationships, judgment calls, and navigating ambiguity. AI is bad at all three. It's good at first drafts and brainstorming. Treat it like a junior analyst who works fast but needs supervision. \n\nWhat contracts are you managing? Industry context might help surface more specific use cases.",

Smooths things over and restores the balance of power\n\n- Writing option papers for risks and issues.

The client contact has a very hands-on management style, constantly requesting changes and adjustments, but then doesn't take responsibility when things don't go as planned. I'm now feeling incredibly frustrated and burnt out after initially being so excited to lead this account.\n\nEvery other day there's a new revision request. We'll spend hours implementing their feedback, then they'll change direction completely and act like we should have anticipated it. When deadlines slip because of all the changes, they blame our team. When the creative doesn't perform, suddenly it's our strategy that was off—even though we followed their direction exactly.\n\nI know I need to have a frank conversation with them about setting clearer boundaries and decision-making processes, but I struggle with talks that require me to push back and advocate for my team. I tear up and get emotional, especially with something like this that has been weighing on me for months. I'm afraid of jeopardizing the relationship or damaging my reputation if I lose control of my feelings, especially because my company values this account highly and I need to keep it together.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to have these kinds of tough conversations and manage emotions?",

Explain if any one constraint changes of either time, cost or scope change then the other two must change. Your question to your client is which one do they wish to change because the constraints are inter-relational and has causal effect.\n\nFor example, you're required to deliver a blue widget (scope) and the client now wants a blue widget with gold wings (scope change), great, you're happy to help but now that impacts on time and cost constraints. All you need to do is highlight the impact of that request. It's a straight forward conversation that you use with fact and fact only. \n\nThe thing is that it's not a personal when you use your triple constraint model because your client has to make the decision but you also get to find out very quickly if they're actually wanting the change when the reality sets on their change request and the impact that it holds for them. I also highly suspect that your client (s) are rough riding you because of your less seasoned approach. As a leader you need to show that you control your projects. \n\nAs you become more seasoned you will start to learn not to take things personally, it's quite common amongst more junior PM but you will find your voice when you have more experience. This is why using the triple constraint conversation is a great way because your client can't take it personally because it's a decision that they have made, so just keep on pushing out the time, cost and scope of the project when they keep on asking for changes, it's their responsibility and not yours, you're just there to facilitate the business transaction. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

If you go in anchored on facts (what changed, how often and the concrete impact on timelines/costs), it stops being personal and starts being operational, which makes it much easier to stay steady.\n\nI’d also suggest writing down exactly what you want to say beforehand and sticking to it, almost like a script, when emotions spike, having those sentences ready helps you not spiral. And if you do get emotional, that doesn’t automatically ruin your credibility. Staying calm is ideal but being human while still clear and firm is usually respected more than people expect.",

As someone who was also in the same exact position about a year ago, in addition to the advice below, I had to start getting ahead of implications of missed deadlines. \n\n\nFor instance, when I sent creative for approval, I would always hold the deadline, and add in 'feedback or approval not received by this date will negatively impact the timeline.' Or if they sent over more feedback 2 days after they said their feedback was all in, I was always quick to respond with 'we've already started work on this round. If we move forward with implementing the changes in this round, our delivery date moves to X.' \n\n\nUnfortunately, I was frequently overridden by the executive on the account who ended up just saying we'd do it. And, of course, it ended up not being a profitable account. But I kept all receipts that I was clear with the client on the implications of their frequent deadline misses and feedback adjustments, which really covered my ass. ",

Everyone leaves feeling like work happened because we talked about work. But the actual decisions either got made before in side conversations or got pushed to after because we ran out of time. The worst part is when conflicts surface. Two teams disagree on scope. What happens? The PM collects both sides then escalates to leadership. Now the PM looks like a messenger. \n\nI talked to a senior PM friend and he said that proficient PMs do most of their work before the meeting even starts. They already know where the disagreements are. They already talked to key stakeholders one on one. The meeting itself is just the final alignment not the discovery phase. If you are finding out about problems for the first time in the meeting you have already lost. Also, if you felt like the meeting is going nowhere, you are the one responsible to steer around. He would use a real-time meeting assistant to take notes and focus on the real flow, so that when discussions are going in circles he can intervene in time. I am going to try that along with doing more prep work before meetings, although it still feels like fighting against a culture that measures productivity by calendar density.",

They already know where the tension is, who disagrees, and what decision is required. The meeting is there to close it out, not surface it for the first time - good PM's find a way to make the decision happen.\n\nIf you’re finding out about issues in the room, you’re already late.

It is an exercise in confirming what the PM already knows and letting the team know of potential problems coming up. \n\nAlso a good exercise to clean up the schedule. In Project I made views for meetings. One showed the week or two weeks past and one showed the upcoming two weeks. \n\nThe view included the standard fields plus: % work complete (this is important, since % complete is schedule based on- it’s saying if you two weeks into a four week project, you are 50% complete). \n\nIn addition, I would have scheduled and actual work (hours) as recorded in the time sheet, and remaining work. \n\nI would filter the tasks based on who was reporting and we would validate the work and remaining work. In Project, if you manually set a task to be 100 % complete (or work complete) then Project assumes you used all the hours. If you completed 40 hours of scheduled work in 32 hours then you have 8 hours of remaining work. Reduce that to zero hours remaining and you now have an extra 8 hours if you need it. \n\nThe look ahead confirmed the work to be done and the resources are ready. In some cases, the team would say that a certain task doesn’t need to be done and I would mark it for deletion, saving the planned work. \n\nMy meetings were always time boxed so we kept the meeting’s flow pretty brisk. \n\nIf the Account Manager or other non-core team member wanted to join, they could. But if they were not on the agenda I discouraged them from participating/speaking. \n\nMeetings like that felt like real work and definitely contributed to everyone’s sense of progress.",

No forcing new templates or anything. Adjusted for like 10 different formats. It updated at the click of a button he did the coding for on the master sheet. He brought his home laptop to his office and hooked it up to his monitors and keyboards with his work laptop sitting next to him standalone. He would play games and work on personal projects all day and took crazy long lunches. He would simply turn to his work laptop and click the button half hour before the meeting and then verify the slides,  maybe 5 minutes tops. He did this for 2 years. His replacement inherited the easiest job on earth but ran his mouth and ended up with more work and broke the template messing with it in an attempt to reverse engineer it.

Not all technical PMs have it that easy. So really it's on you, how organized you are, how demanding your stakeholders are, and how well your team performs together. Now doing implementation projects for a SaaS, fairly easy cus my customers want the product so typically they're eager to get it done, follow through with deliverables, I just make sure the group stays on schedule and we've built in durations that allow for our offshore Development team to have delays so we're not constantly doing schedule changes and adjustments.",

As you can imagine, everything is new to me so things that are said in meetings, don’t always click with me straight away.\n\nEven when meetings are recorded, I find myself taking at least half a day or the full day to go back over the recordings to write up the notes.

What matters is how you approach the work, because once that shifts your effort will drop and execution will improve quickly.\n\nWhen people ask for “detailed notes” they are looking for decisions, actions, risks, dependencies, and open questions, not verbatim capture. Ask the group to record or transcribe the session, particularly for highly technical discussions, and link to it in your recap. Don’t spend time replaying meetings unless something is genuinely unclear or disputed. In complex projects/programs, minutes are not about documentation, they are about enforcing clarity, ownership, and commitment while everyone is still in the room.\n\nYou are not expected to understand every technical detail at this stage. The priority is to have participants state decisions and actions clearly, then recap them at the end to confirm ownership and dates, because that’s what drives progress.\n\nUse a single fixed template every time and keep it high level, covering the purpose of the meeting, decisions made, actions with owner and due date, any risks or blockers, and anything deferred, while cutting noise aggressively. Don’t try to understand everything in real time. Capture unfamiliar terms, ask when necessary, and move on, leaning on subject matter experts to close gaps where needed.\n\nTime box the work so a 60 minute meeting takes no more than 60 minutes to write up, as anything longer is waste. Send the minutes, move on, and remember that if it is too long it will not be read. It’ll take time for you to implement this, but don’t be discouraged and keep persevering.",

As you become more experienced you start to learn what is or isn't important to have in your meeting minutes. I'm certain you would be over documenting the meeting minutes and causing the anxiety that it is, meeting minutes are only meant to reflect key business transactions and quorum sentiments such as decisions, agreed deliverables or any risks or issues. Meeting minutes are not meant to be a record of conversation, unless specifically required then you would record the meeting. Meeting minutes are only meant to reflect key outcomes for reference or sentiments and consider it an ass covering exercise under organisational governance.\n\nI might suggest if you talk with your meeting chair prior to a scheduled meeting and ask what is their expectation is with the meeting minutes. Taking meeting minutes is a skill that you will need to develop but you also need to enhance your active listening and learn to speak up to confirm any outcomes such as a deliverable or key decisions. Respectfully interject with the meeting chair to confirm e.g  When a deliverable has been allocated confirm with the meeting chair of what, who and when the deliverable is due and record it but just make sure that you have everything you need.\n\nI would also suggest have someone peer review your meeting minutes and if they're technical have a subject matter expert review them prior to sending out a draft to the forum for initial review and in principle acceptance. Also keep in mind that meeting minutes are considered a perspective so ensure your meeting stakeholders provide feedback and approval in the advent of you have missed something or you have misinterpreted on what was said or implied or that all of the meetings stakeholders have the same or different views. \n\nJust remember you have a job to do and it's actually not a passive role, you need to interact with the meeting stakeholders to ensure you document the relevant business transactions.   Keep working on it and it will become easier.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

During that 15 minutes as them the following: 1) What are they hoping to accomplish from the meeting? 2) Which item on the agenda is most important? 3) Ask who the VIPs are on the guest list. Then when you are taking minutes do the following: 1) Structure your minutes inside the agenda to start so that you can keep track of where you are in it. Keep an eye out for the key priorities and most important items and focus your energy on making sure these are accurately recorded. 2) Pay attention when VIPs open their mouths and try hard to capture their perspectives. 3) Ensure that the meeting has achieved what the leader was aiming for. If it hasn't ask a question to see if that is something you missed or something they ended up not achieving. This will help build your role at the same time as ensuring you keep up.",

In project support you don't need to get all the details about what the engineers etc. get up to, but you should have at least a broad understanding of the concepts and be able to follow commonly used acronyms and technical terms. \n\nAs a supplement to this, pay attention during meetings and if you don't understand something, ask for clarification. You can't provide good follow up notes if you don't understand what's going on. Don't be afraid to seem ignorant, everyone was new to their role/company at some point and people will mostly be happy to pause and explain. Obviously use your best judgment, don't interrupt every two minutes or call on the CEO to explain an acronym in the middle of a quarterly financial update - and remember it's also fine to write down terms you don't understand and look them up or ask someone afterwards. Hopefully once you get some training on the technical side you will find you follow the flow of the discussion better and need to ask fewer questions. \n\nYou can use AI to summarize meeting transcripts into notes, but I would advise against relying entirely on that instead of taking steps to immerse yourself in your company's internal processes and terminology. Not only will it make you more confident and competent in your current role, but knowing how to efficiently learn the essentials when you start at a new org is a valuable skill to have throughout your career.",

I have tried Cue and for a fee, it has saved me so much time from writing minutes.  it was well worth the investment.   Additionally, if you you use Teams or Zoom for your meetings, enable a transcript and you can feed the transcript file into Copilot which can produce beautiful notes as well. This is free if your company offers those applications.\n\nI would advise you to continue to take notes and listen carefully at meetings and proof the AI generated notes against your notes and what you remember from the meeting  to ensure spelling is correct and its accurate.\n\nYou can thank me for getting your life back later.",

Worked at a mid-size agency for a few years and we had the exact same cycle - everything meaningful happens in Slack, but the timeline just lives in a spreadsheet or asana board that nobody looks at after kickoff.\n\nWhat finally sorta worked for us was basically forcing the timeline *into* the slack conversations. Like, we started using CoordinateHQ (after like, five other tools failed) because it could auto-post deadline reminders and dependencies right into the relevant slack channels. Clients get a stupid-simple portal link via email, no password junk, so they actually click in to approve stuff. The timeline shifts automatically if something slips, so the new deadlines are just... there, in the thread.\n\nIt's not perfect - we still have a million slack convos - but at least now when someone says \"first draft done\" in #project-awesome, the tool automatically updates the next deadline and pings the client for approval. Took the \"whose head is this in\" problem off the table. We still miss dates sometimes but at least we see the domino effect in real time now.",

Together with them, you explore the options available to you…how many people are they providing to the team?  What’s the desired delivery timeline and budget?  That’s your starter pack.\n\nWith that info, you get with the team to unpack the work.  You lead the process of determining how the team can get from point A (a new crew hearing about a new assignment) to point B (project delivered as requested) as predictably as possible.  The plan you all agree on here is your initial “happy path” project plan.  If you can’t even get to this point, you don’t really have a team ready to execute.  Work with your sponsor to settle that first.\n\nThen vet that initial plan with both the team and the sponsor/steering committee (together) to determine what could possibly take the team off the happy path.  Too much concurrent/competing work might pull team members away?  Risk.  Too much scope to deliver within the desired timeline?  Risk.  People or materials could turn out to be more expensive than planned?  Risk.  It’s on you to lead honest, open, fact-based discussions that surface these potential risks, determine how likely they are to occur, and articulate the impact they would have on that happy path plan if they do happen.\n\nWith all of that info, now you have what you need to facilitate the final round of decisions with your sponsors that will arrive at an acceptable plan to deliver work from point A to point B as predictably as possible, while avoiding the risks everyone agrees are likely to occur.  Document the agreements and make sure it’s super clear who on your leadership team you will turn to for help if/when any of those potential risks turn into actual issues, or if new risks arise.  This feels like the part that might be missing for you.\n\nNow you can kick off the project with your team to do the thing, the way you all agreed you would do it.  Set up whatever meetings or tools are needed for everyone to get what they need from each other.  Let the team tell you what they need…those meetings/tools are for getting the actual work done, not for updating you.  You should be able to gather your updates and build your status report from observing the work done against the plan, using the systems you set up (stand ups, Jira stories, whatever).  \n\nAs others have said:  as the PM you are way more than just a reporter.  If you’ve done the proper coalition-building and system-setting at the beginning and there is work that is so removed from your daily visibility that you have to nag for updates, you’ve either left a whole workstream out of your project plan, or you’re not close enough to the day to day activity on the project.",

The moment the constraint sits outside their authority — resourcing, priority clashes, risk exposure — time stops helping and delivery drifts. At that point, “letting it self-manage” is just deferring a decision.\n\nMy trigger is simple: ***if doing nothing for another week makes the decision harder or more expensive, it’s already an escalation and I go further in my projects. My role is to force that decision - enabling the project team to continue delivery.***\n\nTeams can manage work (most projects teams are put together because they are technical experts) what they can’t determine are competing executive interfaces and priorities.\n\nMaking that visible early and forcing a decision enables your project team to deliver.\n\nHope that helps.",

Now I'm here, I feel like I'm being annoying for always asking them an updates 😂\n\n>How do you feel about this? I feel like I'm contributing less compared to the technical project manager because they're always in deployment and he is joining them\n\nNone of this makes sense to me, or fits with my experience. \n\nWhy are you asking for updates? You set up process and people execute. If you have your head screwed on right (to be clear) you have updates due in weekly status on the same day timesheets are collected so that cost, schedule, and performance are synchronized. I like updates in email using templates so that everything just goes into PM tool and archived in accordance with law, regulation, and policy. I think that forcing ICs to interact with a PM tool for status is asking for trouble, high error rates, and noncompliance. No third party tools - templates are built into grown-up email tools. \n\nIf your project manager is technical what is your job and who is in charge? I don't know how anyone can manage something without understanding. That doesn't mean you have to be an expert in everything, but you need to have some subject matter expertise. I can't design a custom ASIC but I understand feature sizes, transmission lines, an foundry limits. I can design structural elements but it takes me three times as long as an expert IC. Software is easy. I can sit in on a code review in nearly any language and contribute. It helps to be a polymath. A firm grip on physics and moderately advanced math is important. Most of the promising people in my PM development track are ICs. The ones coming out of business administration and BA are career limited. \n\nPMs with no domain knowledge are like managers who say \"I don't need to be able to do anything, I'm a manager.\"",

Clients asking questions they won't listen to the answers for, blaming you for scope creep they caused, demanding changes outside the contract—I get it. I'm not some clueless client complaining that devs won't work weekends for free.\n\n\n\nThat said, agency communication has gone to hell the last few years. I'm consistently dealing with dev teams who won't engage when it's literally their job. I'm not asking them to read my mind—I'm talking basic questions like \"what's the timeline for this feature?\" Complete radio silence. Last week I had a project manager who wouldn't respond to Slack messages for days, then acted annoyed when I followed up. No updates, no \"we're working on it,\" nothing. Just to get a status update on work we're paying for, I have to endure passive-aggressive responses.\n\n\n\nI know burnout is real and the industry is tough right now. I get that some people think corporate pleasantries are fake, but basic professionalism has always been expected. Maybe they're going through a rough sprint or hate the project, and I respect that, but I don't know you personally. I'm just trying to get deliverables, understand blockers, or coordinate timelines. I don't think it's too much to ask for someone to be responsive and professional, or at minimum just not be dismissive about it.\n\n\n\nWhat do you all think about client-agency relationships nowadays?

Is it taxing? Yes. Can clients be frustrating? Absolutely. But managing basic professional communication isn't some impossible task. There are even many AI tools now like Chatvisor can help handle most client communication. So sometimes when it's done poorly, isn't it really just laziness?\n\n\n\nWhen I started out, having agency experience on your resume meant employers knew you could handle pressure and communicate professionally. A couple years ago when I was hiring, I actively avoided candidates from certain agencies because their client-facing skills were terrible: couldn't manage expectations, got defensive at feedback, no initiative in communication.

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI would really appreciate your advice on what to do as a new Project Manager stepping into projects much larger in scale than anything I’ve managed before.\n\nI’m a 36F engineer in high-tech manufacturing with 10 years of total experience, including 7 years in my current industry. In my previous role, I was an R&D Project Manager, managing 5–10 small, highly similar technical projects in parallel. These projects were handled by the same team and resources (mostly technicians) in a highly regulated industry with well-defined standard procedures.\n\nMy role mainly involved allocating and juggling team resources, tracking tasks and following up, building and maintaining basic planning (Gantt, PERT), removing obstacles, managing priorities, and ensuring on-time delivery and continuity (holidays, backups, etc.). The people I worked with were lab technicians, factory workers, and engineers.\n\nI joined my current, much larger company six months ago as an Industrialization Engineer. Things have gone well, and I received very positive feedback from my manager, who previously worked as a Project Manager and was part of the PMO team.\n\nDuring my annual review preparation last week, one question was: “Where do you see yourself in the company in three years?” I wrote that I would like to become an official Project Manager, fully aware that the PM role here has a much broader scope than my previous experience.\n\nMy manager was very supportive and suggested that the best path would be to start taking on PM responsibilities and learn on the job. Within one week, he obtained approval from the department director and the PM team lead for me to take over the PM function for all projects in my current team, part-time, while continuing my Industrialization Engineer role for the other half of my time.\n\nI will be taking over these projects from an official PM who was previously assigned to us. For now, I remain within the Industrialization Engineering team, which suits me well.\n\nI know my engineering teammates well and understand the technical work they do (developing and industrializing new products across sites and ramping up production). However, project management in this company is on a completely different level from my past experience. It involves coordination across multiple manufacturing sites as well as finance, business units, compliance, legal, marketing, business development, and sales. There are also many documents and deliverables I’m not familiar with, and the projects vary widely in strategy and industrialization approach depending on the site.\n\nI accepted this opportunity yesterday. Today, it was announced to the Industrialization team, the PM team, and management. My manager expected a gradual handover over three weeks, but the outgoing PM made it clear in a one-on-one discussion that she will provide a single one-hour handover for all projects. After that, it will be up to me to ask the right questions and figure things out on my own. She stated clearly that she will not provide further explanations or support.\n\nI’m very excited about this opportunity, but also very nervous. It’s clearly a step in the right direction, yet I don’t fully understand how everything works or who all my stakeholders are. My manager is extremely supportive and did a lot to make this happen, but I still feel out of my depth and quite lost.\n\nDo you have any advice for me?",

          "text": "Congratulations on your promotion, you have been given a great opportunity to further your career. I question  the incumbent PM's behaviour and her position in only providing a 1 hour handover meeting, not only does it show that they're uncooperative but also not a team player.  To be honest based upon past experience, you have  \"dead cats\" in your projects and they're about to be thrown over the fence to you. Not trying to scare you but the behaviour makes me question the intent behind what has been stated. \n\nWhen taking over any inflight project I strongly suggest that you under take the following: \n\n* Understand that you have the right to review and audit the project prior to accepting any or all responsibility and any issues or problems you have, raise them prior to accepting responsibility because if you don't then that falls on you.\n* You need to review the original business case, ensure that it's fit for purpose e.g. ensure the project can actually deliver in what has been outlined and will the benefits can actually be realised. \n* Undertake a project artefact review, ensure you have an approved project mandate, project plan and project schedule and that schedule has been baselined. You need to clearly understand the project's triple constraints of time, cost and scope. If not that is your first red flag for the current incumbent PM to rectify prior to handing over or you escalate the matter.   \n* I would also suggest reviewing the project decisions, issues and risk logs to see if there is anything concerning or outstanding, if so raise it with the incumbent PM to explain or raise it with your project board, sponsor or executive accordingly. \n* Request a top 5 check list from your incumbent PM, this can be a one pager outlining project scope, financial position (eg forecast cost vs actuals), project objectives, top 5 issues and risks and what are the immediate deliverables that are due and need to be your priority. This is just considered a professional handover and anything less is considered unprofessional. \n* You also need to understand who your project stakeholders are (primary and secondary), this is one of the questions that you ask the incumbent PM to provide but what is the nature of the relationship as well and how do the impact the project. This also helps you identify and foster working relationships off the bat. \n\nThis all might seem a little overwhelming at first and also I appreciate that you're new to the company but may I suggest that don't just walk blindly into an inflight project, ask the hard and difficult questions to make sure you're comfortable in accepting responsibility and if it inconveniences the incumbent PM, then that is their issue and not yours. Good luck in your new role! \n\nJust an armchair perspective. ",

This is happening so quick that I was told about the new role two days ago, handed the documents yesterday evening for handover first thing this morning.\n\nI do think there are dead cats yes. My feeling is that there is something happening behind the scene I am not aware of. The current PM says she is now assigned to the shiny new strategic major new project and has no more time for what she considers less important projects like the one managed in our team. I do feel this is the reason my manager wants a PM managing just the projects in our engineering team. My feeling is that he wants someone the team can talk to and would be available on site 😅\n\nThe better news is that while I don't know who the stakeholders are I know the project well from engineering perspective and the people who will do the real product development and industrializing this and this is doable although there are technical risks. One of my engineering team mates are also in the steering committee meetings since the beginning and I get along with her well so I do hope she can at least fill me in about stakeholder and risks. \n\nRight now I do expect major issues not from technical perspective but from stakeholder / other part of this project beyond engineering's side yes.",
