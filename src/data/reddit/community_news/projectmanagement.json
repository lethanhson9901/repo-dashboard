      "text": "If someone asked me today what project management is actually like, I don’t think I’d start with timelines, tools or frameworks anymore. I’d probably start with the emotional side of it. The part where you’re expected to create clarity in situations where there genuinely isn’t any and still look calm while doing it.\n\nWhat surprised me most over time is how little of the job is about managing projects in the textbook sense. A lot of it is managing ambiguity, unspoken expectations, shifting priorities that no one formally acknowledges and the gap between what leadership thinks is happening and what’s actually happening on the ground. You spend a lot of energy translating between people who all use the same words but mean completely different things.\n\nI’d also warn them that being good at this job often looks invisible. When things go smoothly, it’s assumed they would have anyway. When something slips, suddenly everyone notices the PM. You don’t really get credit for preventing problems that never happened, even though that’s where a lot of the effort goes.\n\nAnd maybe the biggest thing: modern PM work can quietly turn into carrying a lot of mental load for other people. Remembering context, decisions, tradeoffs and history that no one else writes down but everyone expects you to recall instantly. It’s manageable but only if you’re aware of it early and learn how to protect your own bandwidth.\n\nIf you could give one honest warning to someone starting in project management today, what would it be?",

I’d give the following warnings:\n\n- Regardless of your (and the exec’s) instinct, there is no such thing as a tool which in itself allows effective project management. There are vast herds of salespeople who will tell you otherwise and if you buy their software, projects will effectively manage themselves. Fact is - not one single human will willingly take an instruction to complete a task from an automated system.  The sooner you accept this the better. \n\n- Unless you make it explicitly and continuously clear that you are not a ***product*** manager, you will be expected to own the project benefits. You will be expected to design, implement ***and then own*** products delivered during and after the project. The correct idea of a ***sponsor*** owning the benefits and business is alien to most people unless explicitly explained. I have - it seems - mortally offended colleagues when I’ve explained that I consider a project a success if it was closed early when the business case didn’t stack up anymore.\n\n- Finally - when people stop referring to a project as “the project” and start calling it ***“your project”***, you are irredeemably cooked. No way back.",

You are absolutely right that the textbook definitions of \"scope, schedule, cost\" completely miss the reality of the role, which is mostly about managing human anxiety and translating ambiguity into action.\n\nIf I had to give one honest warning to someone starting today, it would be to check your ego at the door because this job requires a very specific emotional contract. My philosophy has always been that when everything goes perfectly, congratulations to the team, but if something goes wrong, I am the first one asking myself \"what did I miss?\" You have to be willing to be the umbrella that gets wet so the team can stay dry.\n\nHowever, the flip side of that warning is understanding what \"success\" actually looks like in this career. It isn't a trophy or public applause. For me, the best reward has always been simply that a company is willing to deposit their trust (and their money) in my skills again. The ultimate compliment for a Project Manager when a project is completed isn't a party, it's just the fact that there is another complex project in the queue waiting specifically for you to lead it. If you can find satisfaction in that quiet continuity rather than public glory, you will survive a long time in this game.",

If you don’t thrive on conflict; if you can’t make a team understand and agree on score, budget and schedule, being a PM may not be for you. \n2. All estimates are guesses and all guesses are wrong. You job is to narrow the focus on destines to achieve a “liveable estimate.”\n3. Hold the Account Teams feet to the fire about what has been promised and what has been included in the contract and the SOW. Focus on differences. It’s fine to be a purist and stick strictly to the contract but if the Account Team/Sales gave the customer an expectation of bells and whistles and they are not there, then you face a situation where you have a technically successful project that the customer rejects and you get painted with the “difficult to work with” brush. \n\nI applied a technique that I learned about from my love of Formula 1. If a team suspects another team(s) of cheating, they send the ruling body, the FIA, a fax saying “If we wanted to do this and such to our car in this way related to FIA regulation XY.ZZ, would it be legal?” If the FIA says no then they quietly inform the FIA that they think Team B is doing that. \n\nSo I would communicate to all saying “The contract addresses this functionality as blah, but the SOW states that the functionality is blah plus B. If the final functionality achieved blah plus B minus, without schedule or budget impact, would that satisfy the requirements?”  \n\nThe response then goes into change control. \n\nAnd, finally, if you don’t thrive on conflict…yeah, I said that before. But to add to it, you need to do your homework to make sure you understand the issue, know the facts, know the options and can express all this clearly.",

Based upon my direct experience younger generation are missing fundamental and core competency project management skills because they seem to be heavily focused on the use of systems and AI to do their job but I also believe this has also been clouded with the advent of Agile and people's understanding and poor implementation of it. \n\nAs a total left field, side note or splitting a fine hair perspective, those in construction have their opinions, yes the building of the pyramids had task management but when you start talking formalized project management techniques it started with the GANTT being developed in 1910 and in 1959 had seen the Critical Path Method (CPM) and the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) techniques developed.  PMI wasn't formed in until 1969 and Prince2 originated from Simpact Systems Ltd techniques in 1975 and under licensed to the British Government allowed PROMPT to be developed, which then became the basis of Prince2 as we know it now\n\nAlso formal project management approaches where also more recognised and utilised within the manufacturing industry rather than the building industry back in the early 60's because of the necessity of prototyping, in which manufacturing became very reliant on the technique but it was also became the fundamental principle of the Agile framework.   \n\nSorry for the walk down memory lane but I actually think it's really important to understand how formalized project management techniques have been developed over the years, hence my statement of software applications is just not project management.",

Fine. “Quick” favors that weren’t quick at all? No problem. I thought that was just part of being a good PM.\n\nSomewhere along the way, that changed. Not because I stopped caring but because I realized that constantly giving everything away doesn’t actually make projects better. It just makes them noisier and more fragile. And once something important is gone, whether it’s focus, clarity or your own energy, it’s incredibly hard to get it back.\n\nNow there’s usually one thing I’m very deliberate about protecting, even if it makes me look less flexible than I used to be. Not in an ego way, more in a “this is what keeps the project alive” way. It took a few painful lessons to figure out what that thing is for me.\n\nWhat’s the one thing you learned the hard way to stop giving away so easily? ",

You don’t need to over complicate this, just choose a good sample size for te different types of projects by complexity (see below).\n\nI’d aim to;\n\n1. Use real data and feedback (from previous SMEs) to identify key insights and learnings.  Which parts of the projects are working well (validate these) and which need improvements?\n\n2. Focus on processes - do you have clear and simple steps for your projects, are they standardised, and are they documented, communicated and understood by all participants? \n\n3. structure/roles - are these clearly defined and understood.  Have you identified all key roles for the projects you run, and are each roles responsibilities/duties documented?\n\n4. Do you have the best possible people (resources) with the best matching skills (technical, non technical) to perform these roles?  You definitely need a dedicated PM. Need a Sponsor (key decision maker/influencer), Business Analyst (ensure scope and business requirements defined and understood, ensures IT Solution design and build is aligned), Lead IT Engineer (Arch), Developers, Testers, business SMEs.\n\n5. Tools review - tools are important, but they are there to support processes and the users, and choose a set that best supports your projects.  Keep it simple and effective.  The MS suite is adequate (including Teams, SharePoint), but you can optionally add Jira (for Agile dev projects), Trello (visual tracking) and Confluence (online content documentation).\n\n6. Most importantly, Identify and prioritise list of improvements, and develop an implementation plan for execution.  This includes assigning owners to Actions. \n\nHere’s some questions to help:\nA) Do you have pre-defined steps to deliver your projects?\nB) Can your projects be categorised based on complexity of delivery, eg. Simple, Standard, Challenging, High Risk?  You may only find that you only have two of these.  Choose whatever suits.\nC) Do you have key quality checkpoints throughout your project steps (aka Gates)\nD) Do I know my top key risk areas and have I built in enough contingencies to mitigate these, eg. Resource capacity, task duration, 10-20% budget, tight scope management (limit creep), key dependencies, gates for approvals, etc.\n\nHope this helps, and good luck.",

I started referencing similar projects TRACs for our estimates and made sure we at least quoted that (unless something could be somewhat reused). \n\nThe other issue is our boss and owner restrained us from planning too far ahead while quoting, but also generally thought quotes were too high based on his vibes. This meant scope became more detailed after the quote was sent, which also led to overruns.\n\nThe only times we've had good budgets is when we were able to do all our planning before the quote, but that does mean racking up 20 or more hours that we might not be able to bill if the project doesn't get accepted. I still think this is better than being in a position to be 50, 100, or more hours over.\n\nThe other issue is clients often don't want to be explicit during the quoting process. Even if scope creeps up because of their lack of detail during quoting (no matter how detailed my questioning), that doesn't mean we won't be blamed.\n\n(I notice that clients are especially resistant to wanting to spell out max numbers of quantifiable deliverables, which is absolutely necessary for an accurate quote. If they don't give that to us, we have to assume—and corporate leadership may restrain me from specifying max deliverables in X category of the quote because they're concerned it won't get accepted if that limit is imposed.) \n\nThe basics of overages fall into the broader category that the people with the most power to either estimate/approve the time (technical staff and corporate leadership responsible for sales respectively) or to detail the scope (client) don't want the responsibility to do so, and the responsibility falls onto the PM even though they don't have control (that would be whoever controls sales/contracts). Wherever responsibility is divorced from power and control, it will produce conflicts, both internally and with clients.",

          "text": "Everyone has offered strong suggestions. One additional point to consider is the level of experience your Project Manager brings. A part-time PM may not be sufficient for this type of complexity. An experienced senior Program Manager with experience in portfolio and strategic planning should be able to add significant value.\n\nSpeaking from experience as a Lead Program Manager, I’ve been brought into initiatives facing similar challenges. In those situations, I was able to reassess budgets and timelines and bring greater clarity to delivery expectations. As others have mentioned, technical teams will often provide high-level SWAG estimates, which can create risk if they are not validated.\n\nIn several cases, I pulled teams back into a structured planning phase to better understand the true scope of work, and 95% of the time that is where I uncover that the original scope was incomplete or inaccurate, causing budget and resource issues. On some agile projects, I’ve found it necessary to apply a more waterfall-style planning approach upfront to establish realistic budgets and timelines before execution.",

Develop a 30-60-90 days training program to bridge the skill gaps, and validate those that you’re already strong on \n4. Prioritise item 3 - based on the specific requirements of your new role (ask your manager).  Some gaps will be more important to bridge than others in the short/medium term.\n5.

That’s the first thing I accepted. The second thing I accepted is that I’m going to make mistakes. The third thing I’ve accepted is that I’m going to learn from those and that I will always have a solution to whatever mistake/hurdle I run into.\n\nSpeaking from the psychology side- the brain doesn’t like change. Change is scary. Change is never a bad thing though as a change typically means better paths and brighter futures. The way I got past self doubt and imposter syndrome: is to be successful at being a good PM. When you start knocking jobs, you catch stuff in preconstruction, when a call you make goes your way- then you go… damn, I can do this. 90% of your success will come in preconstruction. This is where the mistakes happen. Put in the extra time before the project and it can save you hours during the job. What I lack in experience I’ve made up for with hard work. Don’t fake it til you make it. Put the extra time to learn on your own and set yourself up for success. You can’t be an imposter if you are doing it!",

I always tell my team (who need stuff from other teams) that if someone tells you \"we'll get to it\" it never gets done. \n  \n- One \"psychological trick\" I use is to have them come up with the date, so if I need it in 2 weeks, I'll say \"Does next week work? Or a bit more time?\", they'll say \"Maybe two weeks?!\", I'll say great, what date works best, they say \"Last day of week 2\".  \n  \nNow that works, until it doesn't. How do you deal with a situation where John keeps making excuses? Like \"I was blocked by team Y\" or \"I was ready but some new crazy error occurred and I couldn't get it done and I had to troubleshoot\". I understand stuff happens but how you deal with this, especially considering that John probably waited until the day before to even begin the task? \n  \nI don't want to go to their manager, I want quality work from John, I don't want to ruin the relationship. But how can I get them to sort of be on my side and do what needs to be done without being aggressive, going to their manager, or micromanaging their progress?",

          "text": "Can I suggest in not setting a false date in order to deliver on time. An approach would be to set a hard date but you also set up \"progress status reporting\" and that would be depending on the priority and complexity of the task and if there are any interdependencies e.g for a task in two weeks set the hard date and a status report could be set up with just a simple email confirmation on progress and the check in could be set at 1 week out, 3 days and 1 day prior to due date. If it was a high priority with high interdependencies then set it for every day.\n\nAs an example, I required 120 virtual servers to be built as a high priority deliverable and I contacted the T/L first to see it the task was achievable within 6 week period (it was our standard lead time), and it was confirmed that the server team could build them. Because of my hard date I raised the request and spoke with the assigned resource that day, I checked in weekly and in the final week I checked daily. The deliverable was missed, but it gave me the ability to come down hard on the Team Lead and the resource because the allocated resource lied to me and the team lead failed to track effort and over utilised the resource.\n\nYes I can hear you say but they failed to deliver but here is the kicker, after escalation the fallout was immense but here is the thing, it never happened again as both the Team Lead and the technical resource learnt a very public lesson. The thing that nailed them was the progress status update report because I had clearly documented the facts and it was the very thing that sunk them. Just a consideration for reflection. It also taught me a valuable lesson in the process in progress status reporting. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

They went to my boss but he agreed with me. \n\nWe got the contract mod done and in the meantime a clever member of the staff had figured out a script to use to make the change.

Is company culture the problem here? Is it a process problem? \n\n- How can we avoid for this to happen in the future?",

Was actively thinking to myself how stupid the questions were getting and I couldn't wait to get out of there.\n\nBut I felt good going in, that's the thing. Felt good going into my first break. And then...\n\nHave been studying for the last four months. Leading up to test I did the David MacLachlan Udemy course, did the practice exams in PMI Study Hall and got varying scores: On one practice exam I got 83%. The next I got 78%. The mini exams were all over the place- 80s, 90s, some 70s and 60s that I would go back and review and think Ya, that was me going too fast or not reading close enough, that was a dumb choice by me.\n\nI know I need to do something, but just don't know what. I know I'm terrible at taking tests in general, but even this was a bit of a shock to me.",

          "text": "It’s totally okay. Reddit will have you believe otherwise, but this is an extremely difficult exam. It’s long, nuanced, and takes a toll. \n\nI strongly suggest using Andrew Ramdayals PMP material moving forward. I have zero affiliation. Start with his “Mindset” material and then dig into that content. Engraining the Mindset material first will equip you with the exam taking strategy needed to pass. It’s a standardized exam, so strategy tends to matter 50+% of the time. PMI is emphasizing soft skills more-and-more in their content and AR’s content helps. Answers on the exam that practice strong “emotional intelligence” should stand out as the possible answer during process of elimination. \n\nSecondly, remember that a good portion of the exam questions are not graded. They are “pilot” questions that the PMI is (ironically) testing to see if they are viable for future test they plan to administer. Any question that makes you go “wtf is this?!” is often one of those questions. Don’t let it get to you. Follow your instinct on those and move on. \n\nThirdly, get the PMI Agile Practice Guide. Alongside soft-skills, the PMI is skewing more-and-more towards Agile and Hybrid methodologies. Agile gave me a hard time in the exam because I had little exposure to it in my career up to that point. Become very familiar with Agile and Hybrid terminology. Standardized exams often don’t explicitly state the questions context/environment - they test the examiners ability to deduce that through keyword hints. \n\nLastly (ish), when in doubt, follow some classic rules:\n- The words “might”, “may”, etc are risks.\n- Anything that “did” or “has” happened are issues. \n- “Next” steps in a process. They are testing your process knowledge. The next step is the option that you would run into next if you followed the process exactly/literally. If they give you Step 3 in Phase C and the answer choices are Step 2 in Phase B, Step 7 in Phase C, Step 1 in Phase D or Step 5 in Phase C…Choose Step 5 in Phase C. \n- Always assess first. \n- Always gather the group to discuss\n- 99% of the time you’ll never choose the answers that stop/kill the project, escalate to execs, or add more resources. If you aren’t sure of the answer and these extreme choices are next to choices that involve assessing first, gathering the team, etc, then choose one of the latter. \n\nLastly lastly, don’t drive yourself nuts thinking about or fearing the “exceptions”. Exam questions always test a few exceptions, but those questions are always in the minority. Keep an eye out, but don’t hunt for exceptions. Follow the rules of the game, inject your instinct, answer, then move on. \n\nYou’ll pass. Take a break, regroup and then take a fresh approach. We have your back!\n\nEdit: basic typos.",

I’m missing a clear way to see:\n-> What I’m responsible for right now\n-> Where each project actually stands\n-> Who I need to follow up with\n-> What truly deserves my attention today\nIf you’re juggling multiple clients or roles:\n-> How do you organize everything?\n-> One main tool or several?\n-> Any workflows, systems, or habits that helped long-term?\nWould really appreciate hearing what’s worked (or not) for you.",

          "text": "Hey I feel you. At one point I was managing/leading 15 projects. However, stopping there would make it sound worse than reality. I would list the following points that kept me sane :) :\n\n- I spent more time preparing during pre-kickoffs. Aligning on the scope and final deliverables, getting to know the clients and their priorities, how they like to communicate (this is important as some want more regular touch base meetings others, a message on Slack would be more than enough, one prefers slides, other technical demos, etc). This helps me have a solid ground to start from.\n\n- The first two weeks are essential and will require a good amount of time. You get to know your team. Here it is time to build trust and openness among your team members. They are the experts and I'm there to support them and move away any roadblock (unclear expectations, too much meetings, etc). My goal is to build autonomy and ownership. this is key and will give you peace of mind later on.\nAlso, always boost their confidence and praise them when doing good work internally and Infront of the clients, while addressing their mistakes privately. This builds trust and makes them want to do better (we all need to feel appreciated. This helped me a lot because I know that when things go wrong they will reach out to me first (you need that!)\n\n- In terms of meetings I had one call a week with the engineers/developers (internal) and one where we meet with the client. That was more than enough. However, I also ensured that we communicate on the project Slack properly and regularly updates and issues. I usually have many messages to follow up on. I usually read them as soon as they are shared then mark them \"Unread\" and set a reminder on them. This helps me stay focus on what I'm doing and set my priorities on what to repond on now vs things that can wait.\n\n- This is ovbious but worth mentioning :). I had a board for every project with milestones set. Some are common among all projects and others are specific requirements to a given project that we need to achieve. This kept me on track and made me divide my efforts accordingly.\n\n- And finally I trusted my instinct and communicated any concerns or questions with my team (developers and clients). I have never regretted it.\n\nAlso what really helped me is connecting with my team members and being more relaxed and curious about what they are doing. I loved learning about all the great things they were doing. \n\nI hope this helps and I wish you all the best!",

During this time, I was really clicking with the PM because I was learning and eager to help, and they voiced some insecurity in the specific sector of PMing (lol). I first noticed, during the audit, that the PM would pose a question to me about a process, I'd dig and find the solution and they'd present it as their own work externally. Initially, I wanted to name it but I was green so I didn't vocalize my frustration in that. \n\nNow, months and months later, this same PM does the same thing on an even bigger scale by deliberately using their role to \"delegate\". I quote that because the delegation is simply off loading work they don't want to do. It's becoming a real problem because if I question the task ownership, my question is escalated as non-compliance and then it's all turned back on me. \n\nI say anxious because that's exactly what it is. I can best describe it as pacing. Even though we mainly work remotely, I can feel the anxiety in the repeated messages, the constant tinkering with established and trusted processes, and passive aggressive behavior. Their leadership style is also very anxiously asking, not being assertive until questioned and then blame shifts. \n\nThe behavior is noticed by other team members but they essentially can ignore it because of the minimal contact they have with the PM, unlike me. \n\nI'm open to hearing how you all would navigate this. I've been empathizing with the workload and potential burnout on the PM but that's not an excuse for the behavior towards me. ",

The audit was the first major indicator that the first team member was not bluffing. \n\nThe PM does not and has not ever served as a mentor or coach. On the other hand, I have a GREAT line manager that serves as both. For instance, there was a set of trainings there were for PMs only and my LM granted me manual access to attend said trainings because I wanted to learn more. The PM never attended those series of trainings, even with my reminders that they were mandatory for them. \n\nI didn't want to get too specific but the financial tasks that I was interested in were very specific to the overall project and industry. Nonetheless, I stopped asking the PM about the ins and outs because I didn't want it to be dumped on me like before. \n\nThe points of escalation aren't flat out \"xyz is not doing _ task when I ask\", it's more weaponized incompetence and said like \"__ task needs to be done, I'm not sure who does it, but I think xyz (me) can handle it\". This has been done with my line manager, the project director and even executive level. The PM has even agreed to complete a task, ask me to provide the standardized verbiage stating that PMs are the owners of said task, escalated it, and received a reply that PM owns but can pass on completion of the task to anyone else, and then placed the task back on me to complete.

Can you use it for personal goals too (losing weight, moving to a new city, etc)?\n\nBy preference I use rolling wave which is a waterfall variant. You have an overall plan end-to-end that establishes a cost, schedule, and performance baseline. In preparation for each control gate you flesh out the details to the following control gate. This is NOT Agile. Planning for a two week sprint is not a plan. \n\n>2. In terms of things like collecting info, tracking tasks, making sure stuff actually gets done, and not losing the plot when there are a million moving parts...how do you manage all this without feeling overwhelmed? What do you tell yourself when you are overwhelmed or confused as to next steps, etc?\n\n1,200 people working over five years on a massive program worth 100s of millions of dollars doesn't have a million moving parts. A million is a lot. Don't overstate things. Organizational structure (WBS, RBS) is a huge help. Roll-ups and roll-downs. Simple reporting to the plan. Don't force people to use tools they don't normally work with. Collect status and costs in sync. Timesheet day is status day. That's usually Fridays. If you don't have a consolidated view by 1000 Monday morning you're doing something wrong. \n\nAnyone who asks a question gets the latest weekly report. No special runs for anyone. Same report for everyone. If you tailor different reports for internal team, management, customer, customer management you're lying to someone.\n\n>3. Any tools in particular you'd recommend that help?\n\nSoftware can't do your job for you. You have to know what you are doing. The current generation of PM \"tools\" are universally bad. Jira is not a PM tool no matter what Atlassian marketing tells you. It's good for operations e.g. help desk or anything that is a good fit for an SLA but not for PM. Agile is not PM. My first major PM role (not in charge) was an aircraft carrier we managed out of a war room with floor to ceiling white boards. I could run a pretty big program on toilet paper with a Sharpie. I don't want to, but I could. Software is a big help if you know what you're doing. Scitor Project Scheduler, MS Project, Primavera.\n\n>4. Last one is a bit of a bonus question, but I'm curious if you ever explore frameworks/methodologies from other industries to accomplish tasks or if that's overkill. Like do you ever look into how Japan built it's economy so quickly, or how a strong military country plans projects and executes tasks, or look into the psychology of people who are really good at planning/tracking projects?\n\nJapan is easy. Deming. Military (I have experience with US, UK, NOR, and NL) is classic PM. Plan the work and work the plan. In my experience failures especially overruns and delays are people failures not process failures. \n\nThings change with time. PMI drank the Agile Kool-Aid and the PMBOK is not as useful as it once was. MIT OpenCourseware is pretty good. Just skip over the Agile bits.",

Sounds like it will be a minor expense to minimise risk of future wastage and delays on the project. \n\nYou won't necessarily want to follow everything you learn on that course but it'll give you a head start in making intentional choices when you do deviate from whatever methodology you learn. Honestly which one you choose doesn't really matter, none of them are perfect but it gets you into a way of thinking that will really help. \n\nThe most powerful PM tool IMO remains the weekly whole-team update email (starting with exec summary line). Everyone appreciates them and anyone gently called out as owing you some deliverable will usually \"find some time for it\" surprisingly quickly.",

      "text": "TL;DR at the bottom. Thank you in advance from a *very* burnt-out college student. \n\nFor context, I run a fully student-led nonprofit through Discord. Think Slack, but with features geared towards gamers. It's free, widely used by high schoolers (our market), and well-suited to our community. Operations and community are set up in two separate Discord ecosystems, which improves project management. We have about 2,500 students in our community, but our resources have reached as many as 30k in the last two years (January 1st marks the anniversary of our founding!), and we're scaling faster than I expected.\n\nBehind the scenes, though, we consistently struggle with project management. It's not crippling yet, but it's unprofessional and scattered. Due to leadership being student-based (mostly high schoolers) and entirely volunteer-run, accountability is difficult to establish and maintain. I'm a junior in college studying business administration, and as my own expectations and project-management skills improve, the gap between what I know *should* happen and what actually happens has become more obvious.\n\nI care deeply about respecting that this is unpaid work and that real life comes first for everyone involved. That being said, I keep running into the same wall: the students have passion, but often lack the actual skills and follow-through.\n\nPart of this is on me. I've historically taken a very laissez-faire approach to leadership, which is something I'm actively trying to unlearn. As the organization grows, that approach is failing to scale. The lack of structure makes me feel like I'm constantly reacting instead of leading. I've been speaking to professors, and many have echoed sentiments that I'm taking 'servant leadership' too far and I'm becoming a doormat.\n\nI'm open to any advice. This project matters deeply to me, and I know it makes a huge impact on the low-income students we help every day. I don't want it to burn out, but I'm also recognizing that I'm reaching the limits of what I can figure out alone.\n\n*---*\n\n*TL;DR:* I'm a college student running a student-led nonprofit for high schoolers. My project management skills have outpaced our current structure, and the lack of enforceable accountability is becoming unsustainable. I want to respect that everyone involved is a student with IRL priorities, but I'm struggling to balance accommodation with execution. Looking for any advice, no sugarcoating needed.",

Frustrating.\n\n\\- We cross time zones, so we use a Discord-integrated bot that allows us to set meetings/deadlines in advance and include things like dynamic timezone conversion, role pings (for example, \"Project Lead\" vs \"Volunteer\") to delineate who is expected to attend/fulfill the deadline, file drop boxes, etc. Makes life much easier.\n\n\\- We have a very flimsy volunteer onboarding process.

You commit, people expect things from you. Secondly, be real with volunteers about what is generally expected and if they can live up to that. If not, adjust your expectations accordingly. Ask them to communicate proactively when their commitment changes and not when they are already struggling to fullfil it.\n\nI think you have a resource management problem, not a PM methodology one. Doesn't matter which system you build if people aren't able to commit to their responsibility. Try to define 'full time ' roles in your projects or organization and see how many volunteers you need to fill those up, depending on how much time they can commit. Plan for the future and anticipate people moving on when they typically reach certain milestones in their studies. Try to already have alternatives in place or prioritize projects so you still focus your resources when they are limited and you don't get a dozen project teams falling apart",

You may not know what you don't know. \n\nSoftware cannot do your job for you. You have to know what you're doing. That said, software can make your job harder. \n\nIM in general and Discord in particular are very poor as communication of record. Too much gets missed and reconstructing communication and miscommunication becomes a project (ha!) in and of itself. Talk to your college IT people and the academic legal team (not a law school - the people who keep the college out of court) about how they meet requirements for archive and search. You will find that just about everywhere uses email as communication of record. That doesn't mean you can't use Discord for informal and tactical discussion, but anything not in email (or whatever communication of record you choose) didn't happen. Discord is not it. Discord may be fine for outreach to your market. You don't have to use it for substantive communication within your org. \n\nHint: if you're \"burnt out\" as a college student you won't do well in any substantive position. I wish I had the time and flexibility I had in college. I earned two bachelor degrees in four years and went on to earn two masters in three years while working full time plus and having a heavy travel schedule. Working meaningful jobs is much more work. \n\nI have run volunteer organizations while working full time from a small condo association (dozens of volunteers, hundreds of association members) to professional organizations (thousands of volunteers and tens of thousands of members). While there is a certain amount of flexibility necessary managing volunteers aka herding cats, volunteering is a commitment. People need to show up when they are supposed to and finish tasks by due dates. u/lygho1 has it right. \n\nThink about what has been shown to work elsewhere. You aren't doing anything unique or special. You can lift straight out of organizational behavior (OB). I can guarantee that you aren't smarter than W. Edwards Deming.

      "text": "Hello! I want to ask if anyone has had experiences with distributed or democratised project management approaches? Instead of having a plan managed by a single (or small group) of professional PMs, every person on the team contributes to the plan (including its cost, risk and schedule elements).\n\nWhile high-level goals would still be set by management, and mid-level tasks would be set by those managing customer interfaces (i.e., defining WPs etc) or internal planners, the \"detail\" of a plan would be created, updated and managed by more junior staff, the ones doing the work. They would take ownership of small parts of the plan, define their own tasks within that scope, delegate constituent tasks to others, record progress. They would do this without close inspection by the PMs and more senior staff (at least while they stayed within their scope's budge/timeline/risk level etc). Effectively, your master plan is now directly edited, managed and updated by a large number of people, each responsible for their own defined part of it. \n\nPMs would still be involved to check on the overall status, manage resources, conduct upwards reporting and to resolve trade-offs, but this would be a more passive/reactive role, rather than what I see as the more traditional \"active\" role wherein they are continually updating the plan, and distributing tasks. \n\nAnyone done this? How did it work out? Are there named PM philosophies like this I can read up on? Are there PM tools that accommodate this approach?",

The planning teams include PMs, SEs, and implementation people. You don't have all the implementation people. Many will not even have been identified yet. You represent everyone. I've had software devs, EEs, MEs, plumbers, welders, and more in the room. This is not planning with an audience. It's self-forming workgroups. The welders don't care about software and the software people don't care about piping. SEs make sure all the requirements are met. PMs facilitiate and make sure traceability to WBS and RBS is maintained, dependencies are shown, and that work isn't done that isn't needed, and work product that is needed is generated. \n\nI do end-to-end up front and detail to the next control gate. Prep for control gates includes detailed planning to the following control gate. \n\nPMs and SEs and BAs take the plan and adjust estimates based on historic performance and complexity factors. \n\nWith experienced staff and especially with PMs who have facilitated before you can plan a design/build of a US Navy aircraft carrier in about a week, plus the follow up work for adjustments and determining and allocating management reserve. You get help from procurement and receiving and warehousing during the adjustment period. \n\nSoftware people are the most difficult to work with. Whips and chairs help.",

Missing words maybe?\n\nETA after u/rand0anon edited his or her [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1q2t1ut/comment/nxh7ryk/). \n\nI was exposed to this approach in a training offsite in the very early '90s. I'd seen it before that by being included in planning as a junior engineer. The only difference from conventional waterfall or rolling wave planning is the explicit inclusion of implementer representatives in the process. \n\nI've been doing this for more than 40 years. \n\nIt helps to have a template for task instructions: title, WBS, lead, description, resources by RBS, predecessors and successors. For detailed planning more senior review in real time for any task that comes out less than 80 hours or more than 120 hours. For the latter, there may be key tasks that are short but critical and should not be rolled into a larger task. There is no point in breaking down 10,000 feet of welding into small tasks when there are drawings for every inch and inbound steel and outbound scrap are weighed anyway. If you have three coders, an SE, and a SME working full time for three weeks to build and test control code for landing a rocket in a gantry (I have no insight into what it took Space-X to pull that off but I'm impressed) there is not point in breaking that 600 hour task into smaller pieces. The point of review is to make sure there is a good reason for being out of bounds. The higher level planning beyond the next control gate can be hundreds to thousands of hours depending on the quality of your historic information. \n\nThis is all pretty easy in-person. Done remotely you'll need a very stable platform and more facilitators. \n\nWe used this approach in the planning for [LCAC](https://www.navy.mil/Resources/Fact-Files/Display-FactFiles/Article/2170004/landing-craft-air-cushion-lcac/) \\#1. Someone suggested we start building the craft upside down and then flip it over to build the rest. Down hand welding instead of overhead welding saved thousands of labor hours over the course of the contract. I don't remember who had the idea but it was someone who would have never been in the room in a seniors only planning session. \n\nHow can I help?",

But there are quite a few junior staff who would love to self-manage their work and not have it managed for them, and this is a philosophy by which they can do so. \n\nEven for those that aren't natural project managers (or lack the discipline to do it properly), it may still be an improvement. Which sounds more likely to work:\n\n1. A PM assigns a larger task to someone. Then they periodically check in on the assignee to ask how they're doing to ensure progress is OK. They have to dig into the the assignee's planning to understand what they're doing and when, to verify that the assignee has thought through the task and decomposed it properly. If further delegation is required, the assignee needs to re-create a project management system to manage the resources assigned to them, and/or needs to put a request for those resources in the first place.\n\n2. A PM assigns a larger task to someone. They then don't need to check in on the person as they can just immediately see how the assignee is tackling the task, how detailed the planning is, and what the progress within that decomposition is. If delegation of work is needed, it can be transparently seen and assigned.\n\nIn both cases, the assignee may need extra pushing to make them handle the mini-PM part of their role. But in the latter case, once they do this then the PM doesn't need to continually chase updates and \"pry information\" out of the assignee. It rewards and encourages good planning and reporting, and the assignee feels like they are contributing to the planning directly, which is empowering.",

I'm a program manager; my functional teams don't have project managers. They are responsible for their own deliverables. I chase them down for milestones and deliverables, of course - another team is waiting on B and I need it by such and such date. I manage dependencies and risks etc, but I work primarily with leads, not with working teams. How the functional leads run their own team is their own problem unless they don't get it done, and then it's my problem and I step in and project manage.

I have no formal PM training but have done some of it informally with various work-related/extracurricular stuff in my life.\n\nI am currently in the position of \"organizational consultant\" to my family's garment factory. I have been exploring various tools such as Slack, Asana, etc. We all use Whatsapp groups right now—an obvious nightmare lol. However, there are some limitations to my use case: **Most of the employees don't speak English** or any other supported language, so getting all the people who, in a tech-savvier, English-speaking company, would be on the app, is not possible. For example, I cannot get department heads on the app. \n\nAlso, while I would like to get more sign offs, timelines, that kind of thing in front of employees, these apps seem to have too many bells and whistles. **Many of our employees are not particularly tech savvy** and getting them to use a Silicon Valley-built app with all its features would be tough. Right now the factory does a LOT of work on paper. The only people with a computer are the manager, the admin assistants, and the white collar dept (accounting, graphic design). Everyone directly involved in production solely uses paper printouts and Whatsapp. So documents and other visual aids are naturally kept simpler to parse.\n\n**What I *think* would be ideal is an app that needs to be used only by the manager and admin assistant**, as those are the tech savviest people I have the most communication with. I am already doing some spreadsheet training with them (this is the level we're at, they're smart but the knowledge just isn't there!) so I could train them to use the app to create checklists, Gantt charts, and other aids for the various departments. \n\n**Basically: I want the department heads to be able to sign off on things, consult checklists, view timelines, etc. but I want the manager/admin assistant to be the one to make and deliver print outs.** I hope that makes sense, I understand this situation is quite different from the average U.S. office.\n\nI am also very open to any other thoughts you may have on my situation, outside of apps. Like I said I am new to the world of PM and I am sure I have much to learn. Our company has been hit hard by tariffs and we are trying to keep things afloat so everyone can keep food on the table in 2026. I am very grateful for any advice you can provide.",

If you don't follow the above process you run a very high risk of ending up with a white elephant because staff will not see the benefit or it improving their day to day working life and find work arounds or not even use the system at all. Then that falls on to you because you spent a large amount of company money on something that doesn't work. \n\nYou need to shift your perspective, an application doesn't fix the problem unless you know what is actually wrong and that is by understanding what the technical and user requirements are and how they're used in a business workflow. You also need to explain to the executive, if they cut corners and not invest in understanding the problems, you will fail as a company, waste money and put the business at risk. \n\nAlso the attitude of \"I want, I think\" is not a position of strength, you need to show your executive on why a system is needed, with justification and choices. You need to show the benefit (s) of what you're proposing because there would be a significant investment required. Also something of a reflection point, if you don't understand the problem you run the very real risk of being \"that person\" who screwed up. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

The tricky bit tends to be \"what level to break them down into\".   I tend to use the resources needed to identify the break down, ie when a different resource set is needed split that tasks out. The simple example is \"produce spec\" could be one line but if you consider the resources involved we have the author, review group and sign off authority, this leaves a logical split of draft, review, amend, signoff.  In this way your plan tells the story of how the spec is produced, becomes faster to update and more accurate. \n\nLinking the tasks is vital. If you then set deadlines in the end you can see the slack in the schedule as others have said and use that to see if a bit of slippage can be accommodated or if you have to take action to pull it back.\n\nOf all the tools out there only ms project and P6 seem to handle linking tasks well, the rest seem to be card based collaboration and task tracking tools with done scheduling tracked on. However my experience is heavily MSP based so I'm open to learning this is no longer the case :)",
