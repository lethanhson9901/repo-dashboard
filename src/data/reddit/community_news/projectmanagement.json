          "text": "I've implemented Agile in several organisations.\n\nOne of the major tenets of any Agile implementation is that you need the buy-in of senior management. What are your senior management saying?\n\nPut simply, if it's your boss (or boss's boss) who has more sway, then your approach will win. If their boss has more sway, their approach will win. This has nothing to do with what is good for the business or the customers. This has everything to do with empire-building and who gets to look good.\n\nOne of the errors people make when implementing Agile is the belief that somehow, because Agile is iterative, that problems disappear. This is obviously nonsense. People seem to think that \"being responsive\" means that's it's fine to keep changing things all the time, thereby ensuring you have no clear product or \"definition of done\", and a pipeline that is full of senior managers' vanity projects.\n\nDeadlines still exist in Agile: they form a part of an item's priority. When you discuss work items with the Agile team, talk in terms of priority. If you need something done by a certain date, tell them that this deadline is a dependency, and that this should be factored into the priority of the item. You should allow the Agile team to break down your item however they want in order to achieve its delivery, but be clear that your ultimate deadline needs to be met.\n\nThe main difference between waterfall and Agile is that, in waterfall, the Product Spec is generally fixed. This makes sense since, if you are developing a high-rise building, you want to be clear about how much concrete you need to pour, when, and where it goes. Ask your Agile team how they intend to deal with this known problem. Ask it from a place of curiosity, not criticism. How will they ensure an Agile delivery of something physical? \n\nRemember, like every good American idea, the British thought of it first. DSDM predated Agile and was created to allow rapid iteration, something which is not possible in the construction world. Since you can't quickly iterate a data centre build, how will the Agile team adapt to ensure these things happen when they need to while still running an Agile operation?\n\nOne of the founding principles of Agile is transparency. Ask them to make their delivery pipeline visible to you, and all of their backlogs as well. Anything other than a Yes is deflection and is not Agile. Yes, they will want to control what their stakeholders see to some extent (they don't want you banging their door down every day) but they **must** be open to bringing you in to the process. The concept of \"silos\" is inherently anti-Agile.\n\nAnyway, I could wax lyrical on this for ages. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nCheers",

Agile is \"we have a goal, and we do everything we can to reach it, but we embrace that we can't expect a 100% fixed and /correct/ requirement specification by day 0 - but we can start working earlier than that if we get partial specifications and work together in good faith /when/ the speedbumps occur\".",

Whenever there's any request for scope change, or anything that affects the schedule, the backlog is up for renegotiation. It's just that it happens on a regular cadence instead of at a process-defined gates. In non-agile projects, it's more of a constant discussion about \"-Is this part of the requirements - of course it is! -No, that's not on a signed paper. -But according to our interpretations, it is! -But not according to our interpretation\", leaving the PM alone against the stakeholders. \n\n(sidenote: Many ppl think that agile implies scrum at a two-week cadence, but scrum only says 'less than a month', and imho, few actually follow scrum as it is defined. Scrum also assumes the team can work independent of other teams, preferably f2f, as long as the product owner keeps the backlog in order) \n\nHowever, I realize that when building prefab homes, there's less of changes and more of a factory-of-houses that's just assembled on the spot, and there agile methods have less of a benefit than when you're constructing bespoke buildings.\n\nEven with a gate-model, the gate criteria doesn't nesseccarily have to mean 100% done documents, it is often sufficient with \"roughly\" 90% and a risk list for the rest - except as required for regulatory reasons of course.\n\nI mean, you don't NEED to have every luminaries decided in order to give the go for digging the foundation, AS LONG as there is an understanding and respect for that the cost of the luminaries is not yet finalized and that it will have an impact on the final invoice. \n\nIf we look back at the agile manifesto, it actually states \"That is, while there is value in the items on\nthe right, we value the items on the left more.\". It doesn't say that contract negotiations and processes need to go out the window - because that certainly have a value in itself - but people and collaboration is worth more in the end.",

Discuss each practice separately: how it can help or cause harm.\n\nTry to explain your processes to the other team and ask which one or two of their practices you can adopt to make your life better. Discuss them together.\n\nIf they are reasonable, they either suggest something that will work or understand that you have a different reality — win-win.\n\nIf they are not reasonable, then you have a problem :-)\n\nGenerally, I don't believe in a work by a predefined set of practices; I believe that each team should construct its own set  of practices for its own context. Therefore, there is a big chance that you'll be able to adapt something that will help you and keep the other team happy. The same is true for them.",

The best pm’s I’ve worked with take the time and make the effort to understand the mission, then build the project accordingly. That means the project is structured in a way that fits their style of project management. No one is ever going to be more across the needs of a project than the pm, so if they’re forced into a process that doesn’t suit their style or the needs of the project then things will fall apart fast.\n\nTLDR: Establishing processes can provide useful guidelines, but they can also stymie the work of good pm’s and create a false sense of security for bad pm’s and management. There are often good reasons why certain processes are not set in stone and why some pm’s and some projects do things differently.",

It's not complex to reverse engineer a process, but it can be complicated and take a lot of time. Basically anything that any human has done, some other human or group of humans can reverse engineer it. So if the shitz hit the fan, the org can call in high priced consultants to figure things out.",

Because the environment had trained it out of me. Years of zero-sum recognition, political promotion, and cultures where success is invisible but failure follows you for years.\n\nThe dangerous part is how slowly it happens.

          "text": "I did consulting work for a company where your pay was almost entirely connected to performance. \n\nEach concluded task resulted in getting points. Then the points determined your portion of a huge bonus pool. \n\nThere was a leaderboard of where everyone stood. This was hands down the most happy and productive place I've ever experienced. The only people who didn't flourish were those who came, sucked, and then left. That churn was high for new employees, but within a month or less most people knew if this was for them or not.\n\nThis could have resulted in a cutthroat Machivellian nightmare as people clawed and stabbed their way to the top of that leaderboard. But this wonderful term \"Confelicity\" definitely ruled. Once you showed that you were going to be a contributor, people wanted you to succeed. One simple reason was that everyone was given a clear view of the \"big picture\", meaning they saw the bonus pool size as coming from company success. So, if billy bob cooked up a killer feature and sales went up 5% because of that; people didn't care that billy bob got a huge bonus, as everyone else got a slightly bigger bonus as well. Fighting with billy bob would end up hurting everyone in the long run. Like the other baseball players begrudging the homerun king for \"taking too many home runs, he should share them. I hate my growing collection of world series rings.\"\n\nYou would now support billy bob in all his future endeavors, hoping he would hit another home run.\n\nI've explained, (as have the people who work there) how the system was completely amazing; and a huge number of people think they can point out endless flaws. But, the reality is that pointing out that it is impossible for bumblebees to fly. I won't argue aerodynamics, I will just point to the bees.\n\nThe only people for whom this place sucked were crappy programmers who, in most companies would rapidly become managers because they sucked so hard at programming. And just to shoot a common misconception. Junior programmers did find a home here as people would see their potential and mentor them. Also, the churn was so high, that they didn't select from \"top schools\" or any other BS. The programming interview was short, harsh, and was open to almost all takers. By harsh, I don't mean pedantic. But, had questions like, \"If you wanted to start a project with the most technical debt possible, what measures would you take?\" \"How does techncial debt present itself at the end of a project.\" \"What makes a good code review?\" and then they would often roast a person on their answer to this by asking, \"How does that add value and what would happen if you removed that from a code review?\" to nearly ever part of their answer.\n\nMy favourite on this one was when people almost always answered, \"Style guide, the code must follow a style guide or it is unreadable.\" \n\nThen, they would move on to the \"Find the bug\" portion of the interview where they would hand them a bunch of code with wildly varying styles. The bugs were generally easy to find, and not finding them would be a death cookie for the candidate. Then, they would ask, \"Did you have any trouble finding those bugs?\" The answer was usually no. And then they would ask, \"would you like to revisit your answer about style guides required to make code readable?\"\n\nWhile, the company did have a vague style guide, if the person rigidly held to the style guide as an important part of a code review, they were done as a candidate; as this clearly indicated the person had no idea how to work with others in a fluid give and take environment and required rigid rules to make communications possible. They clearly thought other people should have to follow those rules to communicate with them.\n\nThis last is the exact sort of person who would persist in arguing that bees can't fly. Also the sort of person who is technically capable of doing a thing, but will invariably do the wrong thing and make those around them miserable while doing it. No cofelicity to be found from that sort of person.\n\n\nVery little of the interview would confuse a junior programmer with any common sense.\n\nTo the somewhat subreddit topic. This company didn't have managers or PMs. There were the founders who provided a vision, and leadership; also through the points system, the incentive to work on what they wanted done. Then, under that it was a mob of over 200 people who followed that leadership. Within that mob some people worked reasonably independently, others were natural leaders and organized people who followed their lead as a team. This was all very fluid, but tended to form into little treehouses which were individually productive in their own way.\n\n\nI've seen the opposite. Not so much schadenfreude within the company, but it was such a cesspool of micromanagement, that when they have another round of layoffs, everyone who long ago left will ask, \"Did they finally fire James?\" or some other micromanager they hated. In this company there was no room for cofelicity as the managers stole all the successes, and nobody would congratulate them on their stolen valor.",

They were almost the equivalent of a year's salary. \n\nThen, one year everyone got something like 5k. Yet, the company profits were just as good as usual.\n\nIt turned out the managers had convinced the new head that they should allot bonus more for merit. In the months of planning who would get what, the managers just kept rationalizing giving themselves more and more and more. \n\nThe end result was the managers were told to hand the money back, and that maybe they would keep their jobs. If they quit and didn't hand it back, there would be a coming legal battle for them.\n\nThis didn't get most of the many employees who quit to come back. The relationship with the managers was now dead.\n\nIn this company, managers weren't paid more than those they managed. The company merged not long after, and then the whole merger died a dot com death.\n\nHad they not lost those people, and had they not merged; I'm not sure this company would have even seen a financial hiccup from the dot com bust.\n\nI think in most companies the problem is that people at the top really think they are the ones who make it rain. It is usually the team, with the occasional person who everyone knows is super valuable. A sales person who must be a jedi, a tech person who should be teaching at MIT, etc. But the reality is the bulk of people at all levels are helping, yet, managers on up are the ones taking as much credit as possible, and then rewarding themselves with as much money, privileges, etc as they can. There is no confelicity, in that too many accolades to other people might make them want more money, privileges, etc.\n\nA zillion years ago I knew the guy who built the entire computer system for a power company. (late 70s and early 80s). He was the guy. He invented, installed, configured, programmed, etc everything from scratch. He directly reported to the president, and was given a huge amount of leeway to do what he wanted, how he wanted. \n\nThen, the president changed, and annoited his son as head of engineering or CTO or something. The first day the son was there, he had this guy's office torn out. His \"office\" was beside the server room, which had to have their own clean cool environment. It was maybe 200 square feet. This guy showed up on Monday to discover the servers all sitting there on tables as the whole two rooms were an independent construction. He asked what the hell had happened when the son said, \"Only executives get offices, you are not an executive.\"\n\nHe did two things starting that morning. He reconfigured the power system so it would continue to function, but be 100% unmaintainable. He then started a company to sell all the things he had invented, created, etc to other power companies. Prior to that, they had been giving it away for free, as a free exchange. We give you this, you give us that, sort of thing. \n\nHe was minting it within months, and who knows how many millions it cost to replace all his unmaintainable stuff with GE gear? At least 10s of millions in 1980 dollars. It took him a week or two to make his mess and copy his work. He left without notice, or training anyone, the one person who did work with him as his apprentice (and backup) joined his new company.\n\nCompany culture comes from the very top.",

      "text": "Hey all, at the start of the year my team started looking for a new project management solution to track all of our work and act as a single source of truth and I was asked to look at what’s out there and put together a pros/cons list of each so we can make an informed decision. I ended up going pretty deep and felt like it might be useful to other teams.\n\nOur team lives in Slack (and we don’t want that to change) so I specifically focused on solutions with great Slack integrations. The dream was that we could keep working in Slack, but while having a one-stop-shop outside of Slack where you could see/manage everyone’s work. Sorry if you don't use Slack. Probably not relevant for you!\n\nThere are 100s of tools out there so I just focused on the top ones. Let me know if I missed anything important.\n\n# Summary Table\n\n|**Overall**|Overall|Ease of Use|Feature Depth|Slack Integration Quality|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|[Trello](https://trello.com/)|**4.3**|5|3.5|4.5|\n|[Asana](https://asana.com/)|**4.2**|4|5|3.5|\n|[Slack Lists](https://slack.com/blog/news/introducing-slack-lists)|**4**|4.5|2.5|5|\n|[Linear](https://linear.app/) (for dev teams)|**4**|4|3.5|4.5|\n|[Monday](https://monday.com/)|**3.8**|4|4|3.5|\n|[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) (for dev teams)|**3.8**|2.5|5|4|\n|[Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/)|**3.7**|5|2.5|3.5|\n|[Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)|**3.7**|3|5|3|\n\n# Breakdown\n\n# [**Asana**](https://asana.com/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 4 / 5**\n\nAsana is easy once your team agrees on a simple “how we use it” pattern (projects, sections, owners, due dates). The friction shows up when people try to use every view/feature at once - you’ll want a lightweight default workflow and templates.\n\n**Feature Depth: 5 / 5**\n\nAsana is built for *structured project execution*, not just tracking tasks: dependencies, milestones, approvals, and multi-homing (same task in multiple projects) are first-class concepts. \n\nExample: if “Client approval” slips by 3 days, dependency chains make it obvious what downstream work gets pushed, and approvals keep “approved/rejected” explicit instead of buried in comments. \n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 3.5 / 5**\n\nStrong for capture + basic action: you can create tasks from Slack, and use /asana to list/create/complete/comment on tasks from inside Slack. \n\nBut it still behaves like “Slack is where tasks are born; Asana is where tasks are managed” - people will click through when work gets real.\n\n# [**Monday.com**](https://monday.com/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 4 / 5**\n\nTeams often like it immediately because it feels like a visual spreadsheet with statuses. The downside is consistency - if every client board is configured differently, adoption drops because nobody knows where to look.\n\n**Feature Depth: 4 / 5**\n\nMonday can absolutely do PM fundamentals like dependencies and critical path, but some of the more “true PM” features (milestones/critical path in Gantt) are plan-gated, and the system is more board/column-centric than project-logic-centric. \n\nExample: you *can* run a launch chain in a Gantt view with dependencies, but keeping that chain clean across lots of client boards usually turns into more setup/maintenance (columns, views, and rules per board) than in a tool that treats dependencies/approvals as core workflow primitives. \n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 3.5 / 5**\n\nThe integration supports “create items from Slack messages” and “send updates to Slack” patterns, which is the minimum viable Slack workflow. \n\nIn practice, it’s solid for notifications + capture, but not a “run the project in Slack” experience.\n\n# [**Trello**](https://trello.com/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 5 / 5**\n\nThis is the easiest tool here to get a team actually using, because it matches how people already think: “to do / doing / review / done.” If adoption is your #1 constraint, Trello is hard to beat.\n\n**Feature Depth: 3.5 / 5**\n\nGreat for lightweight workflows; less great when you need real sequencing, cross-project visibility, or lots of interdependent deliverables. Example: “Launch date is March 15 so creative must be approved by March 8” can be represented, but it’s not naturally enforced the way dependency-first tools handle it (you’ll rely more on conventions, checklists, and discipline).\n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 4.5 / 5**\n\nTrello is very Slack-friendly: create cards from Slack, preview links, and save Slack messages into Trello (including an Inbox flow). \n\nExample: a client drops feedback in a Slack thread - you can turn that message into a card immediately, then the PM sorts it to the right board/list later. \n\n# [**Todoist**](https://www.todoist.com/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 5 / 5**\n\nFast, clean, and extremely low friction. People will actually use it - but mostly for *their own* tasks.\n\n**Feature Depth: 2.5 / 5**\n\nTodoist is excellent for personal productivity and light coordination, but it’s not a full team PM system (limited portfolio reporting, dependencies, multi-stage approvals, capacity planning). Example: it’s great for “rewrite homepage headline by Thursday,” weak for “manage a 30-asset campaign launch with reviews, handoffs, and client approvals.”\n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 3.5 / 5**\n\nVery good at capture: you can convert Slack messages into Todoist tasks via the message menu, and complete tasks from Slack via /todoist. \n\nBut it won’t give you a shared “project heartbeat” inside Slack - it’s more “turn Slack into a personal inbox.”\n\n# [**Airtable**](https://www.airtable.com/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 3 / 5**\n\nAirtable is easy to *use* once built, but harder to *design* well. Most teams need an owner (ops/PM) to keep the base clean, otherwise it becomes “power-user magic” that nobody else touches.\n\n**Feature Depth: 5 / 5**\n\nThis is the most flexible system here: you can model clients, campaigns, assets, revisions, approvals, and link them together like a database. Example: one campaign record can relate to 40 deliverable records, each with status, owner, due date, and client approval state - that’s Airtable’s superpower.\n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 3 / 5**\n\nThe native Airtable ↔ Slack story is mainly “send updates/notifications into Slack via Airtable automations” plus link previews - not “turn Slack messages into structured records” out of the box. \n\nExample: “when status changes to ‘Needs client approval,’ post to #client-approvals” is straightforward, but the actual work still lives in Airtable.  \n\n# [**Slack Lists**](https://slack.com/blog/news/introducing-slack-lists)\n\n**Ease of Use: 4.5 / 5**\n\nIt’s native to where your team already works, so adoption is naturally higher than any external PM tool. Example: you can turn a message into a list item and keep the context in the same channel/thread instead of asking people to “go update the PM tool.” \n\n**Feature Depth: 2.5 / 5**\n\nLists cover the basics well (task, status, assignee, due date, custom fields, subtasks), but they’re still “lightweight tracking,” not full project management. \n\nExample: you can track a launch checklist and assign owners, but you won’t get the same depth as Asana/Monday around dependency graphs, portfolio-level management, workload/capacity, advanced reporting, or complex multi-project governance - and you can hit list size limits (e.g., 1,000 items on Pro/Business+; higher on Enterprise) that external tools don’t typically constrain in the same way. \n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 5 / 5**\n\nIt *is* Slack, so the integration is perfect and everyone already has access.\n\nYou can also add automation via Workflow Builder (e.g., remind assignees about upcoming/overdue tasks, or post periodic status digests into a channel), which is exactly what a Slack-first team usually needs.  \n\nMy one complaint is that the tabs of Lists, Canvasses, pinned comments etc. can become a little messy and disorganized.\n\n# Dev Tools\n\nI included these for completeness but really Linear and Jira are meant for developer teams (which isn’t us).\n\n# [**Linear**](https://linear.app/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 4.5 / 5**\n\nLinear is opinionated and fast - most teams can be productive quickly because the workflow is largely “pre-decided” (issues + projects + cycles). Example: you can convert a Slack message into an issue in a couple clicks, and it can keep a synced thread so stakeholders stay in Slack while work progresses. \n\n**Feature Depth: 3.5 / 5**\n\nDeep for *software execution* (issues, projects/roadmaps, cycle planning), but less of a general “team PM swiss army knife” than Asana/Monday. \n\nExample: Linear excels at “track bugs + ship features” workflows, but if you want highly customized approval stages per client, elaborate request-intake forms, or heavily tailored reporting for non-technical stakeholders, you’ll feel the limits of its intentionally simpler model.\n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 4.5 / 5**\n\nOne of the best “Slack capture → real tracking” integrations: create issues from Slack messages, keep comment threads synced both ways, and post channel updates (including notifications driven by custom views). \n\nExample: a client drops a bug report in #client-acme - you create a Linear issue from that message and the Slack thread stays synced as the issue gets updated/closed, so your account team doesn’t need a Linear account just to stay in the loop. \n\n# [**Jira**](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)\n\n**Ease of Use: 2.5 / 5**\n\nJira is powerful but heavy - it’s easy for creative/ops teams to bounce off because there are many concepts (issue/work types, workflows, fields) and the UI assumes process maturity. \n\nExample: two teams can have totally different “Done” definitions because workflows are configurable - great for control, bad for adoption if your team just needs “track work without ceremony.” \n\n**Feature Depth: 5 / 5**\n\nIf you need enterprise-grade process control, Jira is top tier: configurable workflows, rich work categorization, and hierarchy (work items → epics → broader planning), plus advanced planning/roadmapping for multi-team programs. \n\nExample: you can enforce that “Client Approval” cannot move to “Scheduled” unless required fields are filled and an approval step happened - Jira can make that policy unskippable, whereas lighter tools rely more on human discipline. \n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 4 / 5**\n\nJira’s Slack app is legitimately capable: notifications, link previews, and the ability to interact with work items from Slack (assign, transition, comment) and create work items from Slack messages/threads. \n\nExample: you can keep a channel subscribed to updates for a Jira project and let teammates transition an issue (e.g., “In Progress” → “In Review”) directly from Slack without opening Jira. \n\nThe catch is adoption: even with strong Slack controls, Jira only works if your team buys into Jira-style process and hygiene.\n\nIf I missed any big ones let me know and I'll add it",

Generally most PM's are over utilised because they get to be the stop gap to poor organisational policy, process or procedures but I also find PM's also don't actually push back either because they're being told by their management team it will be their responsibility.  \n\nI got taught one of my most valuable lesson when I was first starting out, I was faced with being highly over utilized in a new company I had recently joined and wanted to show I was a good employee. I had 18 active projects (yes, proper projects) of various sizes, complexity and costs and I would spend my whole day running from meeting to meeting and I would literally start my project administration work typically at 5:00-5:30 pm and I was usually working a 12-15 hour day. \n\nA peer of mine was concerned for my welfare and asked how was my workload being prioritised, I genuinely couldn't answer their question. His advice is something that I've never forgotten and one of my biggest lessons I've learned as a Project Practitioner and the question when being overloaded is to ask \"what goes on hold whilst I take on this higher priority task?\" and if you don't get an appropriate response then you start using your project controls of issues and risk logs and escalate to the project board/sponsor/executive to address. \n\nIn relation to my anecdotal story, I pushed back on to the Program Director and Account Manager with the simple question of priority. Long story short the proverbial hit the fan after the client was asked to provide a priority listing, the list was whittled down to 6 active projects and the rest were either placed on (in priority) hold or abandoned outright. This very experience taught me such a valuable lesson as a project practitioner because there is only so much one person can do, and I'm not the whipping boy!\n\nJust an armchair perspective    ",

Transparency builds trust. They don’t want to hear it but you don’t want to backtrack later. \n\nI inherited a project where promises were made by my predecessor that never happened. I explained that I couldn’t do anything about that now but here we are today. I provided a plan going forward and gave them timelines. I looked at it as it not being my fault for our current situation. It helped and things got done. I built trust with them and I was thanked later for my guidance. \n\nThat was as a new PM working in data center construction. The pace there was fast, and we had half of the team my company promised, but we had a couple engineers who were all stars. I was stressed out daily. It was stressful but we met the deadline in the end with some caveats. \n\nYour customers will respect your transparency more than you trying to fix things behind the scenes. Rip the bandaid off and get the issues out there. They will be more helpful with that approach after the initial shock wears off. In the meantime, if possible, talk to your management about getting more people to work on the project. Maybe they can do something, maybe not but you’ve got to up-channel the things that keep you up at night. Otherwise, it’s self-induced stress until you relieve the weight on your shoulders.\n\nPrepare for longer days if that’s an option. Plan *with* your team, not just for them. Let them know what’s going on. It makes that part easier as well. It builds trust when everyone knows where things sit.",

Let me add a comment, though, OP, in case you see this before your next client-facing meeting.\n\nEveryone telling you to alert the client to the problem are right,  You definitely should do that, after telling your leadership about the situation and your messaging approach.\n\nBefore doing either, however, I would advise going thru another round of what-ifs to determine what, if anything, your org and suppliers could possibly do to reduce the schedule.  Can your client pay more to your org, to pay your suppliers to crash the schedule?  If your suppliers are late, can other suppliers meet the (or at least get closer to) the original schedule?\n\nEven if your suppliers can’t do anything, and alternative suppliers can’t be used for whatever reason, can your org crash the schedule in other ways (e.g. bring in contractors to reduce timelines later?). \n\nAlternatively, can your org deliver less at first, then iteratively deliver the rest of the solution?\n\nLong story short: We typically work with three constraints.  The schedule is currently cooked.  Work with your teams and leadership to determine what, if anything can be done if the client can pay more or reduce the scope needed by the deadline.  Look for alternatives and present what you find and let the client determine what’s really most important in the triple constraint.",

You also need to understand that your business case is actually fit for purpose along with your project plan and schedule.  You also need to map your relevant project document artefacts to see if they have been delivered, reviewed and approved.  This is to ensure that you're not getting a dead cat that is being thrown over the fence and making sure that you're left holding the cat. \n\nAnything that falls short should be immediately escalated to your project board, sponsor or executive. You also should be raising additional risks and issues and informally socialise them with your project board then formally raise them, so they're not surprised. I would also suggest you have a plan for a way forward e.g re-baselining your project schedule, placing the project on hold or worse case scenario  recommend abandonment.  \n\nYourself, your executive or account manager (urgently) need to sit down with the client in order to reset expectations because if you don't do anything outlined above it will end up in your lap at the end of the project, rightly or wrongly.  At some point once you become the PM it becomes your responsibility and if you fail to escalate the current position it becomes your problem regardless of what state the project is in. Hence why it's so important for the new encumbered PM to audit the project carefully prior to acceptance. \n\nJust an armchair perspective. ",

      "text": "For the past year I have worked as a junior project manager in SaaS company. Mind you, there is no senior PM in the company but since I came in fresh in the role with little to no actual previous experience I have been titled as Junior. \n\nThe CEO of the company moonlights as a dev with just enough knowledge to be more of a hindrance rather than useful. For the past year he has been building products with the help of AI coding assistants and then offloading thousands of lines of code to the dev team to sort out and transform fit for production. From the very beginning requirements gathering has been non existent. Market research, client needs… these are like curse words in our company. CEO has an idea. He vibe-codes it for a month and then leaves a steaming pile of mess for the rest of the team to sort out. We scramble for days to make sense of it and then over the weekend he drops a v2 of his initial product and the scrambling begins all over again. Last year we spent more than 8 dev months on a product, we managed to onboard one client and now it’s getting decommissioned in favor of his newest idea. \n\nFor one of our other products I tried to bring structure into it, established a timeline, he went on the Sales team chat, said the product is “ready” and they can put client on it. I piped in to say that internal testing isn’t finished, we have 4 more weeks on the timeline and I wouldn’t define the product as “ready”. For which I got a chewing directly from the CEO that I “need to understand my role better” and that I can’t keep blocking sales. Which, I swallowed as feedback and rolled with it. The problem is that, 2 days later he was supposed to demo this specific product to a prospective client and some things didn’t work as expected. Then I got another chewing that “this is badly broken and whatever testing plan you put in place was clearly inadequate”. That’s the point I checked out of the job and nowadays I just do the bare minimum. \n\nIt’s hard to put a testing plan together - I don’t have QA testers, I have no requirements, and every time I mention “acceptance criteria” he looks at me like I just cursed his mothers. \n\nI’m allowed to ask him concrete questions on priorities but I have to “spare him the general chitchat” \n\nSales team have meetings with prospective clients, they pass down client needs and market gaps that need filling and I prioritise features based on that. On the next morning, CEO completely overturns priorities because he just spoke to one client and that one client absolutely has to have that one feature this instant. \n\nOn one morning standup he tells me “prioritise this project” and I do - assign resources, draw timelines to the best of my ability, try and chase him to sign off on the plan. And then I learn that 2 out of the 3 resources I assigned have been pulled in other “urgent tasks” and my timeline gets delayed by certain amount of time. And then I get blamed for the delays and insufficient planning. Head of Engineering chewed me once in front of the whole dev+sales team for putting in buffers in my timelines and how that’s misleading and “hurting transparent communication between departments” \n\nMy dev team is just spitting out code to the bare minimum of standards because they are tired of the mess. \n\nWhen I try to enforce change control the CEO goes behind my back straight to devs and wrested them into doing what they want. \n\nMVP is a dirty word and “we can’t expect to turn a profit selling people the bare minimum”. \n\nAnd on and on I can talk about the inadequacy of the whole company. \n\nI have tried all kinds of approaches to stabilise things. But for most of the time nobody listens to me or follows the processes I try to implement - I have been undermined so many times, I have no real authority or voice anymore. \n\nI don’t manage projects - I scramble to write documentation after the fact. I sit in awkward calls where I have to tell stakeholders that what they see demoed in the CEO’s local environment is really nowhere near an accurate representation of the current status of the project. \n\nHow do you deal with a situation like this? I’m burnt out and lost all motivation to try and change things. I’m ready to throw in the towel but can’t afford to remain without a job at the moment. So any coping mechanisms and suggestions would be very very appreciated ",

To be perfectly honest by confronting your CEO this is how you earn your seniority as a project practitioner and experience in handling difficult project stakeholders.\n\nHere is a reflection point for your consideration, if you keep capitulating to his over riding demands, you will be perceived as incompetent because you can never deliver on time but if you start placing the responsibilities back on to your CEO it becomes his issue and not yours. Remember decisions have consequences, you just need to highlight that your CEO with the impact of what he is doing but you need be pointed and ask if he is willing to accept the responsibility of those decisions. Something to keep in the back of your mind, if you don't learn to control or stand up to your CEO to hold him accountable, how are you going to go with your next role and you have the same type of personality to deal with, are you changing jobs again? Just a thought. Either way I hope you find the right solution to your situation but remember to look after yourself because you're in a very stressful situation, it's really up to you on how you want to approach this difficult stakeholder.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

Models themselves are capable of doing 99% of any white-collar job (hopefully I'm not getting hated by some \"domain experts\" who think the know-how in their brain is more valuable than a 1-trillion parameter SOTA model). People also hate on different benchmarks but they are good indicators of general/domain-specific intelligence. \n\nThen comes the elephant in the room, the app layer where you interact with AI. Think of the Co-pilot you've tested. There is so much to be optimized on the app layer, but you generally won't solve them with a stronger model (I guess theoretically you could when they are getting more advanced). The optimization comes mainly from understanding the specific workflows, good UI/UX, and better context management so there is less hallucination. \n\nI guess when folks say AI can't replace them, they are mostly pointing out at the mistakes AI might make as if humans don't make mistakes themselves. \n\n",

          "text": "I like how confident my fellow PMs are whenever AI comes up. But I think the reasons most of you give for why you won't be substituted are based on the wrong mindset. The reality on the ground, especially in software companies, is already moving past this debate.\n\nCompanies that are seriously adopting AI tools are effectively eliminating the repetitive work that many PMs consider their core job. Status updates, Jira grooming, scheduling, stakeholder comms, report writing, risk registers. If that's the bulk of your daily value, you should be worried. Not in 5 years. Now.\n\nAnd here's what I think people in this thread are missing.\n\nLook at what's already happened to developers. In software companies that embrace AI, devs are now expected to work across multiple frameworks, handle full stack responsibilities, manage their own pipelines, and use AI coding assistants daily. The skill bar has gone up massively and team sizes are shrinking while output is growing. Developers had to adapt or get left behind. So why exactly do PMs think they're exempt from that same pressure?\n\nThe traditional PM toolkit, the methodologies, the ceremonies, all the frameworks we learned and got certified in, needs serious revision. Most of it was built for a world where coordination was expensive and information moved slowly. AI has collapsed that cost almost entirely. When an AI agent can summarize a standup, flag risks from commit history, generate status reports on its own, and keep stakeholders informed in real time, what exactly is the PM doing that justifies the seat at the table?\n\nAnd please, the answer can't just be \"soft skills.\" That's become a crutch at this point. The real answer has to be genuine strategic value. Making judgment calls when things are ambiguous. Actually understanding the product and the business deeply enough to challenge decisions. Navigating messy client relationships. Knowing a project is heading off a cliff before the metrics catch up. That's real PM value. But getting there means growing way beyond the mechanical coordinator role.\n\nI'm not saying we all disappear overnight. What I am saying is that the profession needs to evolve and it needs to happen fast. The PMs who will do well are the ones using AI right now to kill their own busywork and reinvesting that freed up time into thinking at a higher level. The ones who keep repeating \"AI is just a tool, it can't replace the human element\" without actually expanding what that human element looks like in practice? Those are the ones who'll find out the hard way.\n\nJust my two cents from someone working in software delivery who watches this play out every single day.

AI and automation in general can handle many standardised activities regardless of course. \n\nIf all your current PM role covers is repetitive administrative work then sure, you’d be right to be worried.

For most PMs, and I include myself in this, it's the majority. Status updates, board maintenance, chasing people for updates, writing reports, scheduling. That stuff fills the calendar. The strategic judgment calls and the empathetic client conversations, those happen what, a few times a month?\n\nSo when that majority of your week gets automated, what happens? Maybe you don't get replaced entirely. Maybe your company just doesn't need four PMs anymore. Maybe they need one who actually does the strategic stuff you're describing and lets AI handle the rest. That's not \"AI can't replace us.\" That's \"AI will replace most of us.\"\n\nAnd about the \"wheel out ChatGPT to explain to a client why you burned a month of budget\" scenario. Sure, a human has to be accountable. But that's one conversation. That's one moment. You don't get to justify an entire role and salary because once a quarter you have a hard conversation. Accountability isn't a full time job. It's a responsibility that sits on top of everything else, and if the everything else is gone, the math stops working in your favor.\n\nAlso the whole \"AI works best in stable environments\" argument was true maybe two years ago. These tools are evolving at a pace that most people in our field are not paying attention to because they're too busy updating boards and attending ceremonies.\n\nI'm not saying soft skills don't matter. I'm saying they're not enough to justify a position if that's ALL you bring. The PMs who will be fine are the ones who combine those human skills with actual strategic thinking, technical understanding, and the ability to deliver outcomes, not just manage process. The ones who just keep saying \"but empathy\" without evolving everything else around it are going to have a rough few years.",

Regardless of whether or not it *can* replace us, c-suite certainly thinks it can, and they make those decisions. \n\n\nNow, there are some caveats here. \n\n\nIn capital projects, I don't see much changing soon. Construction, defense, etc PjMs will be fine for a long time. \n\n\n\nSecondly, even though the *capabilities* are increasing quickly, the speed of uptake is still relatively slow. While software companies are making the switch, banks, CPGs, retail headquarters - these places are slow to adopt. Hell, I work at what is ostensibly a software company and a lot of what I do could be replaced with an Asana subscription and a couple of good Slack connectors, let alone AI. It takes months or even years for us to onboard new software, so change is slow. Companies will take awhile to catch up. \n\n\nThirdly, all of these tools rely on good data. While models are getting better and better at handling complexity, for these tools to work, everyone needs to do *their* job. They need document standardization, knowledge management... They need to update their trackers or tell their trackers to update themselves, etc. If real people really did this regularly, project and program management would have mostly died with MS Project. Yet, here we are. \n\n\nSo while I think we are absolutely going by the wayside, there will be a few year gap, and some of us will stick around. But there will be far fewer of us, and none at all in certain industries, I suspect. ",

And right now, every CEO and CFO is sitting in meetings hearing about how AI cuts headcount and increases output. They don't care about your standup facilitation skills. They care about the number on the spreadsheet.\n\nAnd your point about data quality is spot on too. These tools need good data and most organizations are a mess. But here's the thing, that's a temporary problem. The tools are getting better at handling messy inputs every single month. The \"our data isn't good enough for AI\" argument is just buying time, it's not a defense.\n\nThe PMs who survive the gap you're describing won't be the ones who got lucky because their company was slow to adopt.

Each team is managing their part in their own tools (Jira, Figma, HubSpot, Salesforce) but the dependencies between teams all live in random Slack threads.\n\nDesigner says \"waiting on final specs from engineering\" in Slack. Engineering finished specs yesterday but posted in a different channel. Designer doesn't see it, asks again 3 days later. Engineering is like \"we already posted it\" but now they have to re-explain where. Meanwhile marketing is blocked waiting on assets from design.\n\nThe handoffs between teams are where everything falls apart because Slack is terrible for tracking dependencies. Everyone is doing their part but nobody has visibility into the critical path so we don't realize we're off track until the launch date arrives and we're not ready.\n\nTried using project management software but getting 4 different teams to all maintain the same tool is impossible.

Because that's how so many of us got burnt out and went independent. \n\nOf lates, though, here in the USSA I'm dealing with an entirely different bullshit PITA problem. \n\nI went back and checked some notes in an ancient notebook, and confidently state that in this, the Year of Our Lord 2026, vendors take longer to respond to RFQs and RFPs than they did when we had to use telephones, FAXes, and the post office to get biz done. \n\nExample: A packaging manufacturer of specialty glass for medical devices would turn a quote request in 2 weeks in the early '90s. I'm 4 weeks out now, and they are making excuses and asking for two more weeks. \n\nExample: A custom corrugated company that I've used for a long time used to flip quotes around in 3 to 5 days. Now I'm waiting 2 weeks or 3 for the same information. \n\nExample: A material reprocessor that I've used a few times over the last ten years used to quote in 2 weeks. Now they require 4. \n\nCommon denominator: Thanks to Raygun's successful demolition of the Sherman Antitrust Act, each of the companies I mentioned has been rolled up into every larger companies and then finally merged into huge single-owner Private Equity nightmares. Ferinstance, there used to be about 50 distributors from which I could source packaging for medical devices and cosmetics. There are now 3, and for shits and giggles they've also locked the direct sourcing option out through contractual means.  \n\nIt ain't the people at the companies. They've just been reduced, right sized, reorganized, and de-skilled to the point that they can't do the job. I expect in the next round of \"efficiency\" the last skilled humans will be replaced with an AI chatbot. \n\nAnyway, my friends in China can get a complex device fully quoted in a week or two. Germany might take a few more. I'm *two* fucking months into trying to get numbers for a simple line of cosmetics. \n\nThank you for attending my TED Rant. \n\nAnybody else losing hair around these delays? \n\n",

Your last consideration is potentially looking at vocational training in order to assist you or even reaching out to your vendors for vendor training. \n\nAlso look at your training plan as part of your performance review, if that is if you have one.

          "text": "I consider expediting projects in a couple of ways: \n\n1. Speed up delivery (projects) by examining each element of the project to determine gaps, funnels and roadblocks and designing process solutions to streamline the project. \n\n2. Jumping into a project that is considered “troubled” and figuring out the fastest and most efficient/least cost solution to fix the project and hit the triple constraint. Or at least two of them. \n\n3. When a troubled project continues to devolve, then it can take drastic action to fix it, lest the project becomes “failed” and you risk customer relationships. This is when the original PM begins to reconsider professions and the team realizes that “evenings and weekends” are coming up. Sometimes people say that this is when you “crash” a project. Crashing a project is very intensive review of all ongoing and any remaining tasks to find opportunities to make the work get done faster. Bringing in more people, cutting tasks that risk project success, bringing in cots. Usually referred to as a “death march” project. \n\nI’ve done the first two and they can be fun challenges. I’ve been involved in a death march but not as project management (thank God). It isn’t fun. It isn’t pretty. I got fired over a conference call when I pointed out that a project was hitting the lacing of boots part of a death march. Luckily, the PM (who was a contractor - always a bad sign when you are *undertaking the single largest project the company has taken on, impacting sales, delivery and billing*) didn’t have the authority to fire me. \n\nIt sounds as if you have the right combination of technical skills, PM skills and desire to be successful.",

In most MRO or materials contexts, project expediting is about making sure long lead items actually move through procurement, fabrication, inspection, and delivery on time, spotting risks early and escalating before they hit the schedule. Yes, there is follow up involved, but the stronger expediters I have seen are reading schedules, understanding technical specs, and knowing when a delay is noise versus a real threat to the critical path. The caveat is that in some organizations it can lean more administrative if the process is rigid and transactional.

You are tracking long-lead materials, fabrication progress, documentation, inspections, and shipment timelines. The goal is to make sure what the project needs shows up when it is supposed to, not three weeks after the crew is already mobilized and burning cost.",

It’s not about accelerating the *scope* or project delivery in the broader PM sense. It’s vendor follow ups, checking on manufacturing progress, shipping timelines, customs holds, all that good stuff.\n\nIn reality, a lot of expediting is glorified chasing. Calling suppliers, reviewing logistics trackers, resolving weird delays like 'the crate was missing a customs form' or 'paint wasn’t dry before shipping.' It’s essential work, especially in capital heavy industries where a late valve or skidded unit can hold up a big commissioning date, but it’s rarely glamorous.\n\nThat said, if the role is manager level, it might give you visibility into supply chain risk at the portfolio level and let you build influence across engineering, procurement, and construction. Could be a decent stepping stone if you want to climb the PM ladder but still want to stay close to execution. Just don’t expect a lot of technical depth in the day to day it’s much more about persistence, logistics fluency, and communication.",

If you dont keep the balls up in the air noone is going to pickup the ball for you.  If you are a really good juggler you will make it look easy but its really years of study and practice that make you a bad ass juggler. I dont ever see AI being a responsible juggler. The question that you didnt ask - does AI help us do our jobs? Absolutely, but everything still needs to be checked and vetted with current AI models. In addition, I have been spending time building up my prompts to get AI to do what I need it to do. AI is another tool in my tool belt currently and it is definitely helpful. ",

Make some things easier?  Sure.  Change my core responsibilities as a project manager?  That might be a bit of an overstatement.  At least for now, at most companies.\n\nUsed together, they can help you with executive framing, tradeoff analysis, making decision-making easier, etc., which can, eventually, lead to more responsibility and possibly even promotion.  This is advisable even if the opportunities aren't there with your current employer.  What will likely have more impact on a project manager's fundamental responsibilities is changing leadership's attitude toward project managers and what they expect from them.  Once this expectation is changed, the bar is effectively raised.  Until then, the project manager is assuming greater responsibility that the organization might need, but hasn't granted, yet.",

So the team just has to do a quick review of the generated output, saving hours and they will appreciate that you are meeting them where they are. \n\nThat is just the beginning though.

Do you have a defined scope of work? Are you familiar with what product or services you are delivering to the client? What the major components or milestones are? Is there a signed contract you can review? Start there. You need to know the what. \n\nThen find out if there is a project communication plan and stakeholder register. If these artifacts do no exist see if you can, get your hands on ones from similar projects. \n\nFigure out the project plan. Again is there an existing one or can you copy one? If this is waterfall, once you have the plan, execute against it. Get familiar with a RAID log and keep one. Find out who is making decisions on the project (make a RACI if it will be useful). \n\nIf none of these artifacts exist and your leadership do not support you in creating them and defining scope, etc. then you have an organizational problem. If you are a PM you are not a go-for and you're not admin assistant. You may want to make sure that you're not failing in expectations in part due to the fact that the org does not know what a PM is or is misleading you. \n\n\nIn my experience, as a PM you often work with Directors, VPs and Execs so you have to get comfortable with that. They will make decisions, provide resources and clear blockers. You need them on your team. There can be quite a bit of politics involved.",

I'm afraid their org (assuming they are under the PMO) is setting them up to fail. If they are moving into a PM role with no experience, it seems a well functioning PMO manager would do so making them a Jr. or a coordinator and team them up with a senior associate to train them. But it doesn't sound like that's what's happening.\n\nIt seems OP is in a position with unrealistic expectations but it seems to me if all foundation is missing, the next best way to learn is trial by fire.
