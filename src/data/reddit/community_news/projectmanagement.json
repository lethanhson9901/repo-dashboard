Enrolled in a Project Management class for my grad school program.\n\nThis shit is so abstract that monks would have trouble wrapping their heads around it.\n\nSo jargon filled that it makes L R Hubbard's engram see dollar signs.\n\nAnd the class is so fucking bad that I am losing my goddamned mind.\n\nAlot of fill-in-the-blank tests with the blanks being \"oo, sorry, 'common ground' would be incorrect. what we wanted to hear was MIDDLE GROUND.\" OR SENTENCES WHERE I CAN ONLY GET THEM RIGHT IF I EITHER MEMORIZED THE BOOK OR LITERALLY HAVE THE MATERIAL OPEN IN FRONT OF ME, and then, whats the fucking point?!\n\nThis professor had 20 quizzes due by the third day of an asynchronous class. It took me all night. And by the end I was ripping my mouse apart and performing self harm on my skull. I feel like I have a concussion today.\n\nAND SHE HAS IN THE SYLLABUS A RECOMMENDATION TO JOIN THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE!\n\nIf that institute is all this? Burn it to the fucking ground.\n\n\"Kanban\" \"Project Requisitiion coordinator\" \"Scrum\" as if they fucking have ever played rugby, or even met a rugby player. \"SAFe\"\n\nThe definitions are so self-congratulatory and confident in it's own neccesity. \"Adaptable, also known as Agile methodologies, allow for quick changes and...\" \"But Predictive models also do well in..\" \"But HYBRID models combine the best of both of them\" woooooo WHO WOULD HAVE FUCKING THOUGHT THAT NOT BEING STUCK IN ONE WAY OF THINKING WAS THE FUCKING POINT.\n\nDecision trees\n\nKanban Board Owners\n\nSTAKEHOLDERS. FUCKING STAKEHOLDERS. I CANT EVEN.\n\nI AM DONE. GODDAMN IT I AM DONE. I AM SO FUCKING DONE. I AM DONE. I WANT TO FUCKING CRY\n\nThere is not a genuine human emotion in this class, I feel like I was traumatized by the 80s man from Futurama. I'm vacillating between rage and wanting to cry.\n\nI'm sorry guys. I tried. But fuck project management.\n\nEDIT: Part of my rage could also be that she requires us to get a Chat GPT account, and my resolution for the year was to not use AI ",

I don't know what your degree is in, but if you're anywhere adjacent to corporate America you'll run into a lot of it anyways because you're almost certain to \\*work\\* with PMs.\n\nAll the people telling you you'll never use most of it as a PM are wrong. Am I trotting out PERT charts on a regular basis? Nope. Have I needed to because some exec thought it was \\*ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO BE SUCCESSFUL\\*...yes. If I didn't know what a PERT chart was it would have been hard to recover that relationship.\n\n Did I get an absolutely insane and guaranteed to fail project canceled once because I was able to sit down with the CFO and walk them through a Monte Carlo simulation of possible outcomes, where \"bankrupting the company due to fines and legal fees\" was more likely than \"meeting all objectives\"? Also yes.\n\nExactly once in my two decade+ career for both of those tools.\n\nYou're being shown a toolbox full of tools. Some are going to sit on the bottom of that toolbox 99% of the time. Knowing what and when to pull out the right tool is key. KNowing what all the tools and what they do is where that starts.\n\nAll the tools and jargon in the world are useless if you don't know how to use them and don't have the soft skills that are the core competencies for PMs...but if somebody says \"can you put a slide together showing the critical path as a GANTT chart, with annotations showing the key cross workstream dependencies and significant risks so we can share it with the executive stakeholders,\" you had better be able to parse it.",

I have an undergraduate in electrical engineering and I work as a test engineer in manufacturing. \n\nMy EE GPA was 2.14. I had a rough time in college and I will probably never go back for a masters. \n\nMy Grade for the 3 semesters of PM courses?  100% each semester. \n\nPM makes a lot of sense once you’ve worked on projects and have seen the tools in use. Once you’ve seen the pain points and what the tools are used for, they make sense and when you learn about them in class it is just putting a name to something that feels very obvious. \n\nWhat I saw in that class was that not all PM are engineers, but all engineers understand PM. We are trained to do it starting in college and continuing in industry.  It is more common for engineers to manage their own projects than for a project to get a PM assigned to it. \n\nIf PM doesn’t make sense to you, it is because you haven’t worked on enough projects. Those people who “are efficiently organized” or are “good at time/team management” are using PM techniques without realizing it. \n\nWhen I took that course, I wasn’t learning anything new, I was learning the names of the things I already knew and how to communicate with those who made decisions. The jargon is simply an agreed upon language that allows us to communicate and stay on the same page.",

Good luck, it is so hard.\" I completely psyched myself out for the exam by reading it. \n\nIf you have just a few years of work experience in project-based environments and you watch 1 video on equations, you can wing it and get AT on everything except for Agile.\n\nOf course these tools don't make sense to people who have never used them. I don't know anything about car engines and feel the same way looking at them lol.",

Summer of 2023: Said fuck it, buckled down and found a self-paced study guide with practice tests to prepare for the PMP 4 hour exam. Killed myself memorizing as much as I could.

Possibly an issue where the Cyber Team is stating something must be done 1 way and the \"boots on the ground\" are stating that such a configuration won't work in practical terms.  As the manager of that issue I would need to find \"middle ground\", one where each side can compromise on their stand.

They just add structure. That’s all they are.**\n\nAnd none of them are inherently right or wrong. The problem is the way we treat them as identities: ***“we’re Agile”***, ***“I’m a Scrum Master”***, ***“we use SAFe”*****.** At that point the framework becomes the point, not the outcome.\n\nThe reality is that every project has different risk, uncertainty, constraints, and stakeholders. Pretending one framework fits all of that is lazy thinking from any academic.\n\n**The biggest issue I see in the industry is that we’ve inverted the logic. The framework is supposed to support delivery — not dictate it. Too often the delivery gets bent to fit the framework, instead of the other way around.**\n\nThe most effective projects I’ve seen treat frameworks as tools, not doctrine. You take what you need, discard what doesn’t help, and adjust as the work evolves.\n\nOnce a framework becomes something you’re not allowed to question, you’ve stopped managing a project and started following a belief system.\n\nStick at it if you can.

Use your leverage to get er done. \n\nAll the other fancy jargon with kanban boards and ishigawa charts doesn’t matter unless you’re required by your company’s policy. \n\nProject managing reminds me of the old Wild West when there were good Marshall’s out there upholding the law cause they believe in it, as opposed to the bad ones who make it look easy. \n\nGotta be a people person, problem solve and communicate.

But the role they play can vary WIDELY depending on the industry, company size, etc., so classes that try to scale to the full scope of this profession often feel super jargon-heavy and disconnected just like you’re describing. That was one of my biggest pain points with the PMP and I had to learn to study for the test without getting too hung up on real-life application. I know that’s a solution is also pretty frustrating, but it’s the only way I could preserve my sanity in a courses that try to be broad enough to capture everything so it ends up feeling like it teaches you nothing…. Does that make sense?",

They were either more complicated than necessary or out of date.  It made me wonder how long it had been since the instructors had worked as project managers, if the instructors had ever done more than teach project management.  One was teaching a book he had written that he was trying to promote to businesses as a new approach to use for estimating.  I hadn't heard of it before.  I haven't heard of it since.\n\nIt sounds like your teacher may have made the same mistake with her project management class that many leaders make when it comes to the projects they pursue - effectively communicating why it's needed, the problems it solves, and the benefits of pursuing it in a way that is meaningful to those involved.  Those three things might sound like I'm saying the same thing, but that would be like saying the colors scarlet and crimson are the same as the color red.\n\nIt doesn't help that project managers speak their own language which, in many cases is not even the same language business leaders speak.  There's some overlap, but it's heavily project and execution focused - more tactical than strategic.  Pardon me, it's more about how we get s4!t done, not why we're doing it in the first place.\n\nIt could actually be a good thing that your instructor is including AI in the course.  I won't say it's everywhere, but it's out there, available, and used by a lot of different roles, not just project managers, in tech and business related fields.  You might be able to choose to not use it after you graduate.  Maybe.",

Sponsors do the homework because capacity is a strategic asset to protect, not something to squander. Half-baked ideas don’t make it to the meeting.\n\nMost places aren’t there. Projects get green-lit on napkin-math, then PMs and SMEs are told to “figure it out,” which creates resource conflicts, stuttered starts, and overruns.\n\n**My workaround:** have the PM build the brief (charter) as **living controls**, not a static doc:\n\n* **In/Out-of-Scope matrix** to keep change in check and feed into **Mobilization**\n* **RAID log**, reviewed weekly with clear escalation paths and audits\n* **Financial breakdown** (what we’ll spend, when) to surface variance early\n* **Guiding principles** to push decisions to where the work happens\n\nDo this and the PM shapes outcomes instead of playing order taker asking, “want fries with that?”",

Some folks have expressed worry that we will automate ourselves out of jobs - but that's not a good enough reason to stay away. They are going far enough to give quarterly bonuses out to the most creative and beneficial uses people are able to find. Having hardly used even ChatGPT for a handful of prompts, and no formal training, I am finding it difficult to wrap my head around what use cases the AI is going to actually do for me in my day to day. Right now it feels like the wild west with a small team and everyone trying to establish an effective setup to have AI agents with context only to specific contracts, and also make it collaborative. We are primarily using CoPilot and Loop\n\n  \nWe have a proprietary website portal that has AI agents with context to things like contracts, service tickets, etc. We also still heavily live out of Office for documentation and Teams for meetings and storage. We're setting up individual Teams channels for individual contracts to provide but also limit context for AI agents. So far the biggest benefit has been utilizing Facilitator to recap our brainstorming sessions, create our minutes and assign tasks, and then also reference those to create first versions of SOP documentation. I can wrap my head around that - take a conversation and create helpful process documentation quickly. But, I'm having trouble thinking of more use cases that will actually benefit me. ",

That said, a few things I've found actually useful rather than gimmicky:\n\n\\*\\*Stakeholder communication drafts\\*\\* - Not for the final version, but when I need to write a difficult email (scope creep pushback, timeline slip notification, etc.) I'll dump in the context and ask for a first draft. Saves me from staring at a blank screen for 20 minutes. I rewrite maybe 60% of it, but it gets me moving. ChatGPT or claude or whatever for this.\n\n\\*\\*Risk brainstorming\\*\\* - When I'm doing risk identification for a new project, I'll describe the project and ask what risks I might be missing. It won't catch everything, but it's caught a few things I overlooked because I was too close to the work. I use [rezonant.app](http://rezonant.app) for this.\n\n\\*\\*Translating technical stuff\\*\\* - When engineering gives me something dense and I need to explain it to business stakeholders, I'll use it to help simplify without losing accuracy (use Rezonant for this as well)\n\n\\*\\*Meeting prep questions\\*\\* - Before a kickoff or discovery session, I'll have it generate questions I should be asking. Again, not using them verbatim, but it jogs my thinking. ChatGPT or your LLM of choice for this.\n\nThe \"automate ourselves out of jobs\" worry is overblown for PMs specifically. The job (if you do it well) is fundamentally about relationships, judgment calls, and navigating ambiguity. AI is bad at all three. It's good at first drafts and brainstorming. Treat it like a junior analyst who works fast but needs supervision. \n\nWhat contracts are you managing? Industry context might help surface more specific use cases.",

There was a fair bit of disagreement between the BAs on how to analyse and document requirements and the SMEs had never worked on a project like this so needed a lot of direction. \nGetting some options on how to tackle it and down into plain English that stakeholders could understand was very helpful and reduced the circular debating allowing us to pick a system and get on with it and refine as we went. \nOf course we never got the sufficient legal & contract support to clarify requirements fast enough, but that was a separate issue! 🙄",

I’m not technical and there’s a tense relationship between tech, business and PMs. Engineering staff will often try to pull the wool over my eyes with tech jargon - basically stalling or giving themselves “plausible deniability” for implementations. AI allows me to understand tech options in plain English - I use that to show the tech teams that I understand what they’re talking about. Smooths things over and restores the balance of power\n\n- Writing option papers for risks and issues. AI allows me to take large amounts of data and documentation and draft very brief summaries for problem statements and potential options. ***I ensure that I maintain editorial and content control - AI misses the nuances of my organisation*** but still very useful and time saving\n\n- The old favourite of transcribing meetings in Teams. I work across senior staff with their own agendas - tech / operations / support/ marketing / sales etc - AI allows me to focus on the content of the meetings, not the note taking\n\nThat’s me. It’s currently only really a support system, but great",

We track a lot of our projects at the PMO level with manual spreadsheets and PowerPoint decks, so I have been using that and building out a prototype application that would track and update our key org level milestones, deliverables and other things. It’s also helped me create very useful dashboards within PowerBI (as someone without much experience), which again has helped show a lot of the gaps that we currently have and allows us the opportunities to discuss and close them to keep things on track.",

The client contact has a very hands-on management style, constantly requesting changes and adjustments, but then doesn't take responsibility when things don't go as planned. I'm now feeling incredibly frustrated and burnt out after initially being so excited to lead this account.\n\nEvery other day there's a new revision request. We'll spend hours implementing their feedback, then they'll change direction completely and act like we should have anticipated it. When deadlines slip because of all the changes, they blame our team. When the creative doesn't perform, suddenly it's our strategy that was off—even though we followed their direction exactly.\n\nI know I need to have a frank conversation with them about setting clearer boundaries and decision-making processes, but I struggle with talks that require me to push back and advocate for my team. I tear up and get emotional, especially with something like this that has been weighing on me for months. I'm afraid of jeopardizing the relationship or damaging my reputation if I lose control of my feelings, especially because my company values this account highly and I need to keep it together.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to have these kinds of tough conversations and manage emotions?",

Explain if any one constraint changes of either time, cost or scope change then the other two must change. Your question to your client is which one do they wish to change because the constraints are inter-relational and has causal effect.\n\nFor example, you're required to deliver a blue widget (scope) and the client now wants a blue widget with gold wings (scope change), great, you're happy to help but now that impacts on time and cost constraints. All you need to do is highlight the impact of that request. It's a straight forward conversation that you use with fact and fact only. \n\nThe thing is that it's not a personal when you use your triple constraint model because your client has to make the decision but you also get to find out very quickly if they're actually wanting the change when the reality sets on their change request and the impact that it holds for them. I also highly suspect that your client (s) are rough riding you because of your less seasoned approach. As a leader you need to show that you control your projects. \n\nAs you become more seasoned you will start to learn not to take things personally, it's quite common amongst more junior PM but you will find your voice when you have more experience. This is why using the triple constraint conversation is a great way because your client can't take it personally because it's a decision that they have made, so just keep on pushing out the time, cost and scope of the project when they keep on asking for changes, it's their responsibility and not yours, you're just there to facilitate the business transaction. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

As someone who was also in the same exact position about a year ago, in addition to the advice below, I had to start getting ahead of implications of missed deadlines. \n\n\nFor instance, when I sent creative for approval, I would always hold the deadline, and add in 'feedback or approval not received by this date will negatively impact the timeline.' Or if they sent over more feedback 2 days after they said their feedback was all in, I was always quick to respond with 'we've already started work on this round. If we move forward with implementing the changes in this round, our delivery date moves to X.' \n\n\nUnfortunately, I was frequently overridden by the executive on the account who ended up just saying we'd do it. And, of course, it ended up not being a profitable account. But I kept all receipts that I was clear with the client on the implications of their frequent deadline misses and feedback adjustments, which really covered my ass. ",

If you go in anchored on facts (what changed, how often and the concrete impact on timelines/costs), it stops being personal and starts being operational, which makes it much easier to stay steady.\n\nI’d also suggest writing down exactly what you want to say beforehand and sticking to it, almost like a script, when emotions spike, having those sentences ready helps you not spiral. And if you do get emotional, that doesn’t automatically ruin your credibility. Staying calm is ideal but being human while still clear and firm is usually respected more than people expect.",

This will ultimately be more important internally as a CYA and hopefully a bit less stressful for you. B) will start to remove the emotion since it will be outlined of x change makes x impact. It’s not opinion anymore and is documented so they can’t hold against you C) Hopefully, long shot, will start to change the behavior a bit of how they present changes. \n\nAlso make sure you are running this up to the account director since this will likely come back through them as well. \n\nI worked at an agency for a bit and had some of the worst client interactions I’ve ever had in my career.

Before moving to remote, I used to have a big kanban board, which worked perfectly.  At home, I tried kanban, but a post-it falling off and being eaten by a dog was a literal real problem.  This is the process I've landed on after a few years of iterating, and it works well for me:\n\nI keep the big to-dos/things I need to keep an eye on listed on the first page of my physical notebook, organized by project, with a miscellaneous section at the bottom.  Next to each item is a square that I fill in to show progress.  If something's urgent/high risk, I use a red pen.  Each week, I start a new page.  This keeps me focused on what is in motion, helps me prioritize, and creates a high-level weekly record of my work, which is helpful for annual reviews/checkins.  \n\nSome of the tasks or deliverables above will also live on the project boards that I share with my teams and stakeholders.  Those boards have different filters, including \"all tasks\", \"what's left to do\", and \"what should be started or done this week\".  I keep an eye on these a few times a week to keep our teams on track.  \n\nFor personal notes in projects, I use simplenote.  It's the only notetaking app I could find for Windows that is lightweight, allows simple categorization of multiple notes, and (most importantly) can be sized very small while still being useful.  I dedicate a small portion of my screen so it's always open.  I use OneNote for home projects, but it's too bulky for my professional use and doesn't play well when sized down.  \n\nFor important notes that will be shared with others, or notes that will be pretty much archived once recorded, we just dump those in word and store them in SharePoint.",

They couldn't take it the wrong way and it wasn't personally and it was the impact of their choice because they didn't define their requirements properly. So their lack of planning didn't become my emergency but it's brilliant way to litmus test how genuine the change was or the client was just seeing if they could get away with it.",

Not all technical PMs have it that easy. So really it's on you, how organized you are, how demanding your stakeholders are, and how well your team performs together. Now doing implementation projects for a SaaS, fairly easy cus my customers want the product so typically they're eager to get it done, follow through with deliverables, I just make sure the group stays on schedule and we've built in durations that allow for our offshore Development team to have delays so we're not constantly doing schedule changes and adjustments.",

We used CoordinateHQ to set up automations that would actually nudge the right people when a deadline was coming up, and it pulled feedback from slack threads into the actual task. Clients stayed in slack but the system tracked approvals against the timeline automatically.\n\nIt's not perfect but it killed those \"oh i didn't know creative needed my input by wednesday\" moments. The visibility alone cut our late launches by like half last year.\n\nStill a messy process though lol.",

Together with them, you explore the options available to you…how many people are they providing to the team?  What’s the desired delivery timeline and budget?  That’s your starter pack.\n\nWith that info, you get with the team to unpack the work.  You lead the process of determining how the team can get from point A (a new crew hearing about a new assignment) to point B (project delivered as requested) as predictably as possible.  The plan you all agree on here is your initial “happy path” project plan.  If you can’t even get to this point, you don’t really have a team ready to execute.  Work with your sponsor to settle that first.\n\nThen vet that initial plan with both the team and the sponsor/steering committee (together) to determine what could possibly take the team off the happy path.  Too much concurrent/competing work might pull team members away?  Risk.  Too much scope to deliver within the desired timeline?  Risk.  People or materials could turn out to be more expensive than planned?  Risk.  It’s on you to lead honest, open, fact-based discussions that surface these potential risks, determine how likely they are to occur, and articulate the impact they would have on that happy path plan if they do happen.\n\nWith all of that info, now you have what you need to facilitate the final round of decisions with your sponsors that will arrive at an acceptable plan to deliver work from point A to point B as predictably as possible, while avoiding the risks everyone agrees are likely to occur.  Document the agreements and make sure it’s super clear who on your leadership team you will turn to for help if/when any of those potential risks turn into actual issues, or if new risks arise.  This feels like the part that might be missing for you.\n\nNow you can kick off the project with your team to do the thing, the way you all agreed you would do it.  Set up whatever meetings or tools are needed for everyone to get what they need from each other.  Let the team tell you what they need…those meetings/tools are for getting the actual work done, not for updating you.  You should be able to gather your updates and build your status report from observing the work done against the plan, using the systems you set up (stand ups, Jira stories, whatever).  \n\nAs others have said:  as the PM you are way more than just a reporter.  If you’ve done the proper coalition-building and system-setting at the beginning and there is work that is so removed from your daily visibility that you have to nag for updates, you’ve either left a whole workstream out of your project plan, or you’re not close enough to the day to day activity on the project.",

At that point, “letting it self-manage” is just deferring a decision.\n\nMy trigger is simple: ***if doing nothing for another week makes the decision harder or more expensive, it’s already an escalation and I go further in my projects. My role is to force that decision - enabling the project team to continue delivery.***\n\nTeams can manage work (most projects teams are put together because they are technical experts) what they can’t determine are competing executive interfaces and priorities.\n\nMaking that visible early and forcing a decision enables your project team to deliver.\n\nHope that helps.",

Now I'm here, I feel like I'm being annoying for always asking them an updates 😂\n\n>How do you feel about this? I feel like I'm contributing less compared to the technical project manager because they're always in deployment and he is joining them\n\nNone of this makes sense to me, or fits with my experience. \n\nWhy are you asking for updates? You set up process and people execute. If you have your head screwed on right (to be clear) you have updates due in weekly status on the same day timesheets are collected so that cost, schedule, and performance are synchronized. I like updates in email using templates so that everything just goes into PM tool and archived in accordance with law, regulation, and policy. I think that forcing ICs to interact with a PM tool for status is asking for trouble, high error rates, and noncompliance. No third party tools - templates are built into grown-up email tools. \n\nIf your project manager is technical what is your job and who is in charge? I don't know how anyone can manage something without understanding. That doesn't mean you have to be an expert in everything, but you need to have some subject matter expertise. I can't design a custom ASIC but I understand feature sizes, transmission lines, an foundry limits. I can design structural elements but it takes me three times as long as an expert IC. Software is easy. I can sit in on a code review in nearly any language and contribute. It helps to be a polymath. A firm grip on physics and moderately advanced math is important. Most of the promising people in my PM development track are ICs. The ones coming out of business administration and BA are career limited. \n\nPMs with no domain knowledge are like managers who say \"I don't need to be able to do anything, I'm a manager.\"",

The guy I worked with in the dish pit for those couple weeks was the happiest guy I ever met. He was a migrant from Ecuador. No amount of slop and mud could get him down. I was miserable. I asked him his secret. He told me that this was only one of three jobs he had washing dishes. He worked 7 days a week 12 to 18 hours a day. He was happy to do it because he was putting two kids through college and he knew they would never have to migrate to a different country to wash dishes to provide a better life for themselves. \n\nI highlight these experiences because whenever I see the current generations use words like traumatic when describing their high paying office jobs I assume they have zero perspective on what life could have been like for themselves had they zigged when they should have zagged.",

They are unable to prioritize things, spending hours on non-urgent items while P0 things await in the corner. They won't own things, and ask everything they do under the guise of \"not wanting to make an error\". They will block overall progress of a project's lifecycle, confirming but never implementing, or taking hours to complete. They will make you anxious and second guessing everything you assigned to them.\n\nIn my experience, the former is a gem, and they'll get promoted right away anyway, so you'll usually be stuck with the latter, sadly.",

      "text": "I’ve been thinking about this after watching a few projects struggle in ways that didn’t really make sense on paper. The decisions themselves weren’t obviously bad. Reasonable people, decent data, good intentions. And yet… things still unraveled.\n\nWhat stood out to me is how early a lot of those decisions were locked in.\n\nWe talk endlessly about what decision was made. Feature A vs B. This market vs that one. This metric vs another. But we rarely talk about when the decision was made and whether the situation had actually settled enough to justify certainty.\n\nIn practice, early certainty feels productive. It gives teams something solid to rally around. It reduces anxiety. It makes planning easier. But it also freezes assumptions that haven’t had time to be challenged yet. Once something is decided, it quietly becomes expensive to question, even when new signals show up.\n\nI’ve seen teams spend months executing flawlessly on a direction that probably needed a few more uncomfortable weeks of ambiguity upfront. And by the time reality caught up, the cost of changing course felt higher than just pushing through and hoping for the best.\n\nIt makes me wonder whether timing is an underrated product skill. Knowing when to decide isn’t about confidence or boldness, it’s about sensing when the system has revealed enough of itself to make a decision that won’t age badly.\n\nHave you been burned more by bad decisions or by decisions that were simply made before the problem had fully shown itself?",

Working with the data you have to make decisions is something we do every day. \n\nThink about a simple transaction. Buying Steel for your project.  \nCompany 1. You have purchased from them for 10 years, and had less than \\~1% defect rate with consistent delivery on time.  \nCompany 2. You have purchased from for the last 10 years, but they are often 3-6 weeks late and have a defect rate of \\~3%.\n\nWhich would you choose if pricing is the same?\n\nCompany 1 seems like the safer choice, both from a quality and delivery perspective. So you choose company 1 for this project.\n\nBefore the steel ships there is now a 20% tariff on Canadian steel from company 1, where company 2 is US Based and would not have the tariff. \n\nYou made the best decision for the project based on the information available. You could have waited to make the order until later, but that would have added timeline risk. So in mitigating the timeline risk, you took on geopolitical risk that seemed smaller at the time. Small enough that even seasoned PM's would not have added it to a risk register.\n\nThe issue isn't that the decision was made too soon, or without enough information its that there is risk that can't be anticipated. Its called unknown unknowns and we deal with them everyday. If you think unknown unknowns are something you are immune to, I would point to 2020 and the pandemic. So many projects were impacted by something no one had on their radar.",

What matters is how you approach the work, because once that shifts your effort will drop and execution will improve quickly.\n\nWhen people ask for “detailed notes” they are looking for decisions, actions, risks, dependencies, and open questions, not verbatim capture. Ask the group to record or transcribe the session, particularly for highly technical discussions, and link to it in your recap. Don’t spend time replaying meetings unless something is genuinely unclear or disputed. In complex projects/programs, minutes are not about documentation, they are about enforcing clarity, ownership, and commitment while everyone is still in the room.\n\nYou are not expected to understand every technical detail at this stage. The priority is to have participants state decisions and actions clearly, then recap them at the end to confirm ownership and dates, because that’s what drives progress.\n\nUse a single fixed template every time and keep it high level, covering the purpose of the meeting, decisions made, actions with owner and due date, any risks or blockers, and anything deferred, while cutting noise aggressively. Don’t try to understand everything in real time. Capture unfamiliar terms, ask when necessary, and move on, leaning on subject matter experts to close gaps where needed.\n\nTime box the work so a 60 minute meeting takes no more than 60 minutes to write up, as anything longer is waste. Send the minutes, move on, and remember that if it is too long it will not be read. It’ll take time for you to implement this, but don’t be discouraged and keep persevering.",

In project support you don't need to get all the details about what the engineers etc. get up to, but you should have at least a broad understanding of the concepts and be able to follow commonly used acronyms and technical terms. \n\nAs a supplement to this, pay attention during meetings and if you don't understand something, ask for clarification. You can't provide good follow up notes if you don't understand what's going on. Don't be afraid to seem ignorant, everyone was new to their role/company at some point and people will mostly be happy to pause and explain. Obviously use your best judgment, don't interrupt every two minutes or call on the CEO to explain an acronym in the middle of a quarterly financial update - and remember it's also fine to write down terms you don't understand and look them up or ask someone afterwards. Hopefully once you get some training on the technical side you will find you follow the flow of the discussion better and need to ask fewer questions. \n\nYou can use AI to summarize meeting transcripts into notes, but I would advise against relying entirely on that instead of taking steps to immerse yourself in your company's internal processes and terminology. Not only will it make you more confident and competent in your current role, but knowing how to efficiently learn the essentials when you start at a new org is a valuable skill to have throughout your career.",

As you become more experienced you start to learn what is or isn't important to have in your meeting minutes. I'm certain you would be over documenting the meeting minutes and causing the anxiety that it is, meeting minutes are only meant to reflect key business transactions and quorum sentiments such as decisions, agreed deliverables or any risks or issues. Meeting minutes are not meant to be a record of conversation, unless specifically required then you would record the meeting. Meeting minutes are only meant to reflect key outcomes for reference or sentiments and consider it an ass covering exercise under organisational governance.\n\nI might suggest if you talk with your meeting chair prior to a scheduled meeting and ask what is their expectation is with the meeting minutes. Taking meeting minutes is a skill that you will need to develop but you also need to enhance your active listening and learn to speak up to confirm any outcomes such as a deliverable or key decisions. Respectfully interject with the meeting chair to confirm e.g  When a deliverable has been allocated confirm with the meeting chair of what, who and when the deliverable is due and record it but just make sure that you have everything you need.\n\nI would also suggest have someone peer review your meeting minutes and if they're technical have a subject matter expert review them prior to sending out a draft to the forum for initial review and in principle acceptance. Also keep in mind that meeting minutes are considered a perspective so ensure your meeting stakeholders provide feedback and approval in the advent of you have missed something or you have misinterpreted on what was said or implied or that all of the meetings stakeholders have the same or different views. \n\nJust remember you have a job to do and it's actually not a passive role, you need to interact with the meeting stakeholders to ensure you document the relevant business transactions.   Keep working on it and it will become easier.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",
