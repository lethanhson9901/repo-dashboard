In the Far East at least, dates are promises and breaking them destroys trust and clients' confidence in you. That's why most Japanese, Korean and Singaporean game companies never give public roadmaps, and US game companies would put out public roadmaps that changes every quarter.\n\nI am from the Far East, so I learned it the hard way when my western partner started with a too good to be true timeline and kept pushing the dates with foreseeable reasons. I'm not saying it doesn't make sense, I'm just saying that it has given me quite a bit of cultural shock.\n\nAnother thing I hate is how the Chinese and Indian companies seem to exploit the system by constantly starting with a shorter timeline and lower budget, and then ramping them up mid projects, especially Chinese construction and tech companies. This is why they can win the bids and keep the profits.",

You never got rid of it. They would say \"turning it over to the business\" but didn't actually practice it. That role had me working way too many hours, nightmares about work, extreme stress, asshole bosses. \n\nBut I'm currently working for a company in which they follow standard project management practices, I'm not actually doing the project work, and I don't have to own the process or system after closure. It's very nice and extremely doable.",

They are going far enough to give quarterly bonuses out to the most creative and beneficial uses people are able to find. Having hardly used even ChatGPT for a handful of prompts, and no formal training, I am finding it difficult to wrap my head around what use cases the AI is going to actually do for me in my day to day. Right now it feels like the wild west with a small team and everyone trying to establish an effective setup to have AI agents with context only to specific contracts, and also make it collaborative. We are primarily using CoPilot and Loop\n\n  \nWe have a proprietary website portal that has AI agents with context to things like contracts, service tickets, etc. We also still heavily live out of Office for documentation and Teams for meetings and storage. We're setting up individual Teams channels for individual contracts to provide but also limit context for AI agents. So far the biggest benefit has been utilizing Facilitator to recap our brainstorming sessions, create our minutes and assign tasks, and then also reference those to create first versions of SOP documentation. I can wrap my head around that - take a conversation and create helpful process documentation quickly. But, I'm having trouble thinking of more use cases that will actually benefit me. ",

That said, a few things I've found actually useful rather than gimmicky:\n\n\\*\\*Stakeholder communication drafts\\*\\* - Not for the final version, but when I need to write a difficult email (scope creep pushback, timeline slip notification, etc.) I'll dump in the context and ask for a first draft. Saves me from staring at a blank screen for 20 minutes. I rewrite maybe 60% of it, but it gets me moving. ChatGPT or claude or whatever for this.\n\n\\*\\*Risk brainstorming\\*\\* - When I'm doing risk identification for a new project, I'll describe the project and ask what risks I might be missing. It won't catch everything, but it's caught a few things I overlooked because I was too close to the work. I use [rezonant.app](http://rezonant.app) for this.\n\n\\*\\*Translating technical stuff\\*\\* - When engineering gives me something dense and I need to explain it to business stakeholders, I'll use it to help simplify without losing accuracy (use Rezonant for this as well)\n\n\\*\\*Meeting prep questions\\*\\* - Before a kickoff or discovery session, I'll have it generate questions I should be asking. Again, not using them verbatim, but it jogs my thinking. ChatGPT or your LLM of choice for this.\n\nThe \"automate ourselves out of jobs\" worry is overblown for PMs specifically. The job (if you do it well) is fundamentally about relationships, judgment calls, and navigating ambiguity. AI is bad at all three. It's good at first drafts and brainstorming. Treat it like a junior analyst who works fast but needs supervision. \n\nWhat contracts are you managing? Industry context might help surface more specific use cases.",

The challenge was pulling the requirements out of a dozen + contractual documents that had significant cross linkages across the different projects in the program.  There was a fair bit of disagreement between the BAs on how to analyse and document requirements and the SMEs had never worked on a project like this so needed a lot of direction. \nGetting some options on how to tackle it and down into plain English that stakeholders could understand was very helpful and reduced the circular debating allowing us to pick a system and get on with it and refine as we went. \nOf course we never got the sufficient legal & contract support to clarify requirements fast enough, but that was a separate issue! 🙄",

We track a lot of our projects at the PMO level with manual spreadsheets and PowerPoint decks, so I have been using that and building out a prototype application that would track and update our key org level milestones, deliverables and other things. It’s also helped me create very useful dashboards within PowerBI (as someone without much experience), which again has helped show a lot of the gaps that we currently have and allows us the opportunities to discuss and close them to keep things on track.",

I’m not technical and there’s a tense relationship between tech, business and PMs. Engineering staff will often try to pull the wool over my eyes with tech jargon - basically stalling or giving themselves “plausible deniability” for implementations. AI allows me to understand tech options in plain English - I use that to show the tech teams that I understand what they’re talking about. Smooths things over and restores the balance of power\n\n- Writing option papers for risks and issues. AI allows me to take large amounts of data and documentation and draft very brief summaries for problem statements and potential options. ***I ensure that I maintain editorial and content control - AI misses the nuances of my organisation*** but still very useful and time saving\n\n- The old favourite of transcribing meetings in Teams. I work across senior staff with their own agendas - tech / operations / support/ marketing / sales etc - AI allows me to focus on the content of the meetings, not the note taking\n\nThat’s me. It’s currently only really a support system, but great",

I’d have an hour-long recording and spend 90 minutes just picking out the decisions.\n\nWait, actually—this is where I started using BOYA Notra for my syncs. It just lives in my meetings, grabs the transcript, and spits out a clean list of next steps and key points. Took that manual \"re-listen and highlight\" grind off my plate. It’s not perfect, sometimes it misses nuance, but it gave me a 80%-complete draft to tweak instead of starting from zero.\n\nMaybe look at your own recurring tasks that are heavy on info processing? Status report updates, risk log reviews, even parsing long email threads for blockers. The trick is to offload the *processing*, not the thinking. You still gotta guide it and sanity-check the output.\n\nAlso, your contract-specific Teams channels are a smart move. We tried something similar for scope documents. How’s that going for you guys?",

Everyone leaves feeling like work happened because we talked about work. But the actual decisions either got made before in side conversations or got pushed to after because we ran out of time. The worst part is when conflicts surface. Two teams disagree on scope. What happens? The PM collects both sides then escalates to leadership. Now the PM looks like a messenger. \n\nI talked to a senior PM friend and he said that proficient PMs do most of their work before the meeting even starts. They already know where the disagreements are. They already talked to key stakeholders one on one. The meeting itself is just the final alignment not the discovery phase. If you are finding out about problems for the first time in the meeting you have already lost. Also, if you felt like the meeting is going nowhere, you are the one responsible to steer around. He would use a real-time meeting assistant to take notes and focus on the real flow, so that when discussions are going in circles he can intervene in time. I am going to try that along with doing more prep work before meetings, although it still feels like fighting against a culture that measures productivity by calendar density.",

It is an exercise in confirming what the PM already knows and letting the team know of potential problems coming up. \n\nAlso a good exercise to clean up the schedule. In Project I made views for meetings. One showed the week or two weeks past and one showed the upcoming two weeks. \n\nThe view included the standard fields plus: % work complete (this is important, since % complete is schedule based on- it’s saying if you two weeks into a four week project, you are 50% complete). \n\nIn addition, I would have scheduled and actual work (hours) as recorded in the time sheet, and remaining work. \n\nI would filter the tasks based on who was reporting and we would validate the work and remaining work. In Project, if you manually set a task to be 100 % complete (or work complete) then Project assumes you used all the hours. If you completed 40 hours of scheduled work in 32 hours then you have 8 hours of remaining work. Reduce that to zero hours remaining and you now have an extra 8 hours if you need it. \n\nThe look ahead confirmed the work to be done and the resources are ready. In some cases, the team would say that a certain task doesn’t need to be done and I would mark it for deletion, saving the planned work. \n\nMy meetings were always time boxed so we kept the meeting’s flow pretty brisk. \n\nIf the Account Manager or other non-core team member wanted to join, they could.

This has been happening for years, and I see it accelerating as organisations lean harder into frameworks — *“we’re Agile”, “I’m a Scrum Master”, SAFe everywhere*.\n\nA lot of meetings now exist to create the **theatre** of delivery. Work gets discussed, slides get shown, people nod — and everyone leaves feeling like progress was made. But no decisions actually moved. Anything difficult either happened beforehand in side conversations or got kicked to “offline” when time ran out.\n\nThe PM then captures all of this in a report. At that point they’re not delivering a project — they’re reporting on the performance of one - and lets face it we know a lot of those reports dont get read.\n\nGood PMs don’t use meetings to discover problems. They already know where the tension is, who disagrees, and what decision is required. The meeting is there to close it out, not surface it for the first time - good PM's find a way to make the decision happen.\n\nIf you’re finding out about issues in the room, you’re already late. And if the meeting is drifting, steering it isn’t optional — that *is* the job.",

The client contact has a very hands-on management style, constantly requesting changes and adjustments, but then doesn't take responsibility when things don't go as planned. I'm now feeling incredibly frustrated and burnt out after initially being so excited to lead this account.\n\nEvery other day there's a new revision request. We'll spend hours implementing their feedback, then they'll change direction completely and act like we should have anticipated it. When deadlines slip because of all the changes, they blame our team. When the creative doesn't perform, suddenly it's our strategy that was off—even though we followed their direction exactly.\n\nI know I need to have a frank conversation with them about setting clearer boundaries and decision-making processes, but I struggle with talks that require me to push back and advocate for my team. I tear up and get emotional, especially with something like this that has been weighing on me for months. I'm afraid of jeopardizing the relationship or damaging my reputation if I lose control of my feelings, especially because my company values this account highly and I need to keep it together.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to have these kinds of tough conversations and manage emotions?",

          "text": "It's a straight forward conversation, it's your triple constraint question. Explain if any one constraint changes of either time, cost or scope change then the other two must change. Your question to your client is which one do they wish to change because the constraints are inter-relational and has causal effect.\n\nFor example, you're required to deliver a blue widget (scope) and the client now wants a blue widget with gold wings (scope change), great, you're happy to help but now that impacts on time and cost constraints. All you need to do is highlight the impact of that request. It's a straight forward conversation that you use with fact and fact only. \n\nThe thing is that it's not a personal when you use your triple constraint model because your client has to make the decision but you also get to find out very quickly if they're actually wanting the change when the reality sets on their change request and the impact that it holds for them. I also highly suspect that your client (s) are rough riding you because of your less seasoned approach. As a leader you need to show that you control your projects. \n\nAs you become more seasoned you will start to learn not to take things personally, it's quite common amongst more junior PM but you will find your voice when you have more experience. This is why using the triple constraint conversation is a great way because your client can't take it personally because it's a decision that they have made, so just keep on pushing out the time, cost and scope of the project when they keep on asking for changes, it's their responsibility and not yours, you're just there to facilitate the business transaction. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

If you go in anchored on facts (what changed, how often and the concrete impact on timelines/costs), it stops being personal and starts being operational, which makes it much easier to stay steady.\n\nI’d also suggest writing down exactly what you want to say beforehand and sticking to it, almost like a script, when emotions spike, having those sentences ready helps you not spiral. And if you do get emotional, that doesn’t automatically ruin your credibility. Staying calm is ideal but being human while still clear and firm is usually respected more than people expect.",

Or if they sent over more feedback 2 days after they said their feedback was all in, I was always quick to respond with 'we've already started work on this round. If we move forward with implementing the changes in this round, our delivery date moves to X.' \n\n\nUnfortunately, I was frequently overridden by the executive on the account who ended up just saying we'd do it. And, of course, it ended up not being a profitable account. But I kept all receipts that I was clear with the client on the implications of their frequent deadline misses and feedback adjustments, which really covered my ass. ",

No forcing new templates or anything. Adjusted for like 10 different formats. It updated at the click of a button he did the coding for on the master sheet. He brought his home laptop to his office and hooked it up to his monitors and keyboards with his work laptop sitting next to him standalone. He would play games and work on personal projects all day and took crazy long lunches. He would simply turn to his work laptop and click the button half hour before the meeting and then verify the slides,  maybe 5 minutes tops. He did this for 2 years. His replacement inherited the easiest job on earth but ran his mouth and ended up with more work and broke the template messing with it in an attempt to reverse engineer it.

As you can imagine, everything is new to me so things that are said in meetings, don’t always click with me straight away.\n\nEven when meetings are recorded, I find myself taking at least half a day or the full day to go back over the recordings to write up the notes. I feel like everything is so technical, the processes, acronyms used, sometimes it’s hard to keep up. I take notes and actions from like 5 meetings per week? Some are about 30 minutes and some are over an hour.\n\nAny advice?

What matters is how you approach the work, because once that shifts your effort will drop and execution will improve quickly.\n\nWhen people ask for “detailed notes” they are looking for decisions, actions, risks, dependencies, and open questions, not verbatim capture. Ask the group to record or transcribe the session, particularly for highly technical discussions, and link to it in your recap. Don’t spend time replaying meetings unless something is genuinely unclear or disputed. In complex projects/programs, minutes are not about documentation, they are about enforcing clarity, ownership, and commitment while everyone is still in the room.\n\nYou are not expected to understand every technical detail at this stage. The priority is to have participants state decisions and actions clearly, then recap them at the end to confirm ownership and dates, because that’s what drives progress.\n\nUse a single fixed template every time and keep it high level, covering the purpose of the meeting, decisions made, actions with owner and due date, any risks or blockers, and anything deferred, while cutting noise aggressively. Don’t try to understand everything in real time. Capture unfamiliar terms, ask when necessary, and move on, leaning on subject matter experts to close gaps where needed.\n\nTime box the work so a 60 minute meeting takes no more than 60 minutes to write up, as anything longer is waste. Send the minutes, move on, and remember that if it is too long it will not be read. It’ll take time for you to implement this, but don’t be discouraged and keep persevering.",

Ask for 15 minutes of their time to ensure you are most equipped to support the agenda. During that 15 minutes as them the following: 1) What are they hoping to accomplish from the meeting? 2) Which item on the agenda is most important? 3) Ask who the VIPs are on the guest list. Then when you are taking minutes do the following: 1) Structure your minutes inside the agenda to start so that you can keep track of where you are in it. Keep an eye out for the key priorities and most important items and focus your energy on making sure these are accurately recorded. 2) Pay attention when VIPs open their mouths and try hard to capture their perspectives. 3) Ensure that the meeting has achieved what the leader was aiming for. If it hasn't ask a question to see if that is something you missed or something they ended up not achieving. This will help build your role at the same time as ensuring you keep up.",

As you become more experienced you start to learn what is or isn't important to have in your meeting minutes. I'm certain you would be over documenting the meeting minutes and causing the anxiety that it is, meeting minutes are only meant to reflect key business transactions and quorum sentiments such as decisions, agreed deliverables or any risks or issues. Meeting minutes are not meant to be a record of conversation, unless specifically required then you would record the meeting. Meeting minutes are only meant to reflect key outcomes for reference or sentiments and consider it an ass covering exercise under organisational governance.\n\nI might suggest if you talk with your meeting chair prior to a scheduled meeting and ask what is their expectation is with the meeting minutes. Taking meeting minutes is a skill that you will need to develop but you also need to enhance your active listening and learn to speak up to confirm any outcomes such as a deliverable or key decisions. Respectfully interject with the meeting chair to confirm e.g  When a deliverable has been allocated confirm with the meeting chair of what, who and when the deliverable is due and record it but just make sure that you have everything you need.\n\nI would also suggest have someone peer review your meeting minutes and if they're technical have a subject matter expert review them prior to sending out a draft to the forum for initial review and in principle acceptance. Also keep in mind that meeting minutes are considered a perspective so ensure your meeting stakeholders provide feedback and approval in the advent of you have missed something or you have misinterpreted on what was said or implied or that all of the meetings stakeholders have the same or different views. \n\nJust remember you have a job to do and it's actually not a passive role, you need to interact with the meeting stakeholders to ensure you document the relevant business transactions.   Keep working on it and it will become easier.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

          "text": "First, if you're struggling with technical language and acronyms, I would ask your manager about getting training/immersion in the technical aspects of the business so you can understand it better. In project support you don't need to get all the details about what the engineers etc. get up to, but you should have at least a broad understanding of the concepts and be able to follow commonly used acronyms and technical terms. \n\nAs a supplement to this, pay attention during meetings and if you don't understand something, ask for clarification. You can't provide good follow up notes if you don't understand what's going on. Don't be afraid to seem ignorant, everyone was new to their role/company at some point and people will mostly be happy to pause and explain. Obviously use your best judgment, don't interrupt every two minutes or call on the CEO to explain an acronym in the middle of a quarterly financial update - and remember it's also fine to write down terms you don't understand and look them up or ask someone afterwards. Hopefully once you get some training on the technical side you will find you follow the flow of the discussion better and need to ask fewer questions. \n\nYou can use AI to summarize meeting transcripts into notes, but I would advise against relying entirely on that instead of taking steps to immerse yourself in your company's internal processes and terminology. Not only will it make you more confident and competent in your current role, but knowing how to efficiently learn the essentials when you start at a new org is a valuable skill to have throughout your career.",

You don’t have to get into the nitty gritty but keep it high level. \n\nRemember the meeting is meant to be a forum to get everybody together to discuss an important topic that could not be discussed over email or would be grossly inefficient to discuss over email. \n\nIn regard to how write meeting minutes, use the agenda as a guide. The agenda should be an evolution of the previous week’s meeting minutes. “Here’s what we were supposed to get done since we last met…” “did we get everything done?” If yes….that goes into your minutes as completed. If no….that goes into your minutes as still outstanding. Next the agenda should have any new topics that need to be discussed. “Did they get discussed?” If so, capture the key points that came up in the meeting and ensure that you capture the action items and who is assigned to complete them and by when.  Keep it high level and just use bullets as key points. Also, at the top capture who attended the meeting and who was unable to join. At the bottom of your minutes, write when the next meeting is going to be. \n\nSend the draft meeting minutes out to the entire project team and ask them to come back to you within 24 hours with anything that they feel is inaccurate or was missed. \n\nRemember, your job is to be a facilitator of the process and not the gatekeeper or owner of the minutes. It’s their meeting and their meeting minutes. You’re just doing them a favour by drafting them but you’re not going to take ownership of what is included.",

Clients asking questions they won't listen to the answers for, blaming you for scope creep they caused, demanding changes outside the contract—I get it. I'm not some clueless client complaining that devs won't work weekends for free.\n\n\n\nThat said, agency communication has gone to hell the last few years. I'm consistently dealing with dev teams who won't engage when it's literally their job. I'm not asking them to read my mind—I'm talking basic questions like \"what's the timeline for this feature?\" Complete radio silence. Last week I had a project manager who wouldn't respond to Slack messages for days, then acted annoyed when I followed up. No updates, no \"we're working on it,\" nothing. Just to get a status update on work we're paying for, I have to endure passive-aggressive responses.\n\n\n\nI know burnout is real and the industry is tough right now. I get that some people think corporate pleasantries are fake, but basic professionalism has always been expected. Maybe they're going through a rough sprint or hate the project, and I respect that, but I don't know you personally. I'm just trying to get deliverables, understand blockers, or coordinate timelines. I don't think it's too much to ask for someone to be responsive and professional, or at minimum just not be dismissive about it.\n\n\n\nWhat do you all think about client-agency relationships nowadays? Any advice for managing these dynamics without it turning toxic?",

Client management was DRILLED into us—both from senior devs and leadership.\n\n\n\nThe longer I work in this industry, the less patience I have for poor client communication. If you can't even send a status update or acknowledge a message, I'm going to escalate it.\n\n\n\nI'm so sick of hearing about \"how difficult it is to deal with clients.\" It's not rocket science. Is it taxing? Yes. Can clients be frustrating? Absolutely. But managing basic professional communication isn't some impossible task. There are even many AI tools now like Chatvisor can help handle most client communication. So sometimes when it's done poorly, isn't it really just laziness?\n\n\n\nWhen I started out, having agency experience on your resume meant employers knew you could handle pressure and communicate professionally. A couple years ago when I was hiring, I actively avoided candidates from certain agencies because their client-facing skills were terrible: couldn't manage expectations, got defensive at feedback, no initiative in communication. Some are fantastic of course, but I wasn't taking chances.",

By no means am I disagreeing with your mindset and approach because there's nothing worse than having to answer ridiculous and stupid questions whilst under pressure to deliver on time, trust me I get it but there is also a time and place for it.\n\nI had an interesting experience once where my program board where crazier than a racoon backed into a corner with a shotgun, after I did some digging it turns out that they where not confident technically or making technical decisions and they where struggling to understand what I was delivering despite it being their own IT system. So I got creative and started sending out information packages \"about the technology\" being used, essentially it was a disguised 101 guide about the infrastructure being delivered. Was it inconvenient? Yes, extremely but It made my life a lot easier but the thing was that it also helped with the racoon problem, at least I now had a safety on the shot gun.\n\nWhilst it may seem inconvenient at the time you have to ask yourself what is driving the behaviour? Work back from there. If you start educating stakeholders, particularly in project management principles and frameworks as most have a misconception of what it actually is and how it's applied properly, it definitely leads to having better working relationships. Just a reflection point for your consideration.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

To you have any idea how many disciplines are involved in design/build of an aircraft carrier? Or a satellite? Or a global high volume, high rate document authoring and dissemination system? Even a deployed remote sensing system has a huge number of disciplines. Language is all we have to communicate with so vocabulary is MORE critical to cross-functional activity. Even if you maintain a project glossary people are unlikely to look because they don't realize they are using words differently. If you think cross-functional is hard, try multiple languages with team members using their second, third, or seventh language. Even common languages are not a guarantee.

Unfortunately, this person consistently delays the project. In meetings, they make big commitments and speak very confidently, but afterward he would completely disappear for next 24-48 hours, no responses to message or calls. \n\nIf anyone else takes the initiative or moves forward in their absence, he later criticises the work or tries to prove it wrong, resulting in rework and further delays. He has a very high-ego personality, and replacing him isn’t an option because he is the main face to the client and senior management.\n\nI also feel that he may have developed a personal grudge against me, possibly due to frequent follow-ups or escalations when he doesn’t respond. At this point, it’s becoming a nightmare to manage. Even when I guide developers or make decisions to keep things moving, those decisions are later challenged, and more time is lost.\n\nHas anyone dealt with a similar situation? How do you manage a critical stakeholder who blocks progress but cannot be removed? Any practical strategies would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.",

I was constantly involved in ego pissing matches between SME's.\n\nWhen I first started out as a PM I would have these individuals behave in the same manner but when I became a bit more seasoned I started holding them to account and calling out their behaviour with fact. I would suggest the escalation process as follows:\n\n* Informally speak with them 1:1 and use fact to highlight the impact that they have by their behaviour and if you find no resolution then escalate to their team lead. Set your expectation if they are to provide subject matter expertise they are bound to the project schedule and if they fail to meet the agreed date then the matter gets escalated.\n* After the informal conversation with the SME and if the behaviour continues then escalate the matter\n* Whilst the escalation is underway informally speak with the SME's  team lead and provide documented evidence of the behaviour and how it's directly impact your project delivery.\n* If there is no adequate outcome with the team lead then you need to formally escalate it to your project board/sponsor/executive because your triple constraint is constantly being put at risk at the expense of your SME's unprofessional and unacceptable behaviour. Start showing how much time and money is being wasted because of their inability to deliver or playing hardball you start pushing out delivery dates because your triple constraint is being impacted.\n\nAt the end of the day if this individual likes you or not, you shouldn't take it personally, all it shows is how unprofessional and insecure they are as an individual.  Drive home your triple constraint and if they impede the delivery of your triple constraint then call the behaviour out and let the team lead, project board, executive or worse case scenario HR deal with the issue. It's not a project problem, it's a culture issue and that lies with your executive.\n\nBy using documented facts and evidence it's hard for the SME to take it personally because it's their action that is being highlighted and it can't come back at you because all you do is point to the facts and leave it at that.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

There may be something you're missing thats important. Be brave as he may be defensive. Approach it from a problem solving perspective.\n- You can increase transparency. I don't know what works best in your organization, but log the things and timestamps of when they are handed over to this person and when they are reviewed and complete. If necessary make it into a regular report.\n- You could also completely ignore his reviews and take the risk/rework. I only recommend it if your sponsor really trusts you and you know what you're doing.\n\nFinally, becareful with how you do these things. If you cowboy your way tagging him in emails saying he's the rootcause of your problems will create more friction and create a bad attitude. It's possible he's an asshole and is trying to be political. You as a PM need to create evidence and facts that make clear what is happening.",
