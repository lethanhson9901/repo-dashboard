      "text": "If someone asked me today what project management is actually like, I don’t think I’d start with timelines, tools or frameworks anymore. I’d probably start with the emotional side of it. The part where you’re expected to create clarity in situations where there genuinely isn’t any and still look calm while doing it.\n\nWhat surprised me most over time is how little of the job is about managing projects in the textbook sense. A lot of it is managing ambiguity, unspoken expectations, shifting priorities that no one formally acknowledges and the gap between what leadership thinks is happening and what’s actually happening on the ground. You spend a lot of energy translating between people who all use the same words but mean completely different things.\n\nI’d also warn them that being good at this job often looks invisible. When things go smoothly, it’s assumed they would have anyway. When something slips, suddenly everyone notices the PM. You don’t really get credit for preventing problems that never happened, even though that’s where a lot of the effort goes.\n\nAnd maybe the biggest thing: modern PM work can quietly turn into carrying a lot of mental load for other people. Remembering context, decisions, tradeoffs and history that no one else writes down but everyone expects you to recall instantly. It’s manageable but only if you’re aware of it early and learn how to protect your own bandwidth.\n\nIf you could give one honest warning to someone starting in project management today, what would it be?",

I’d give the following warnings:\n\n- Regardless of your (and the exec’s) instinct, there is no such thing as a tool which in itself allows effective project management. There are vast herds of salespeople who will tell you otherwise and if you buy their software, projects will effectively manage themselves. Fact is - not one single human will willingly take an instruction to complete a task from an automated system.  The sooner you accept this the better. \n\n- Unless you make it explicitly and continuously clear that you are not a ***product*** manager, you will be expected to own the project benefits. You will be expected to design, implement ***and then own*** products delivered during and after the project. The correct idea of a ***sponsor*** owning the benefits and business is alien to most people unless explicitly explained. I have - it seems - mortally offended colleagues when I’ve explained that I consider a project a success if it was closed early when the business case didn’t stack up anymore.\n\n- Finally - when people stop referring to a project as “the project” and start calling it ***“your project”***, you are irredeemably cooked. No way back.",

You are absolutely right that the textbook definitions of \"scope, schedule, cost\" completely miss the reality of the role, which is mostly about managing human anxiety and translating ambiguity into action.\n\nIf I had to give one honest warning to someone starting today, it would be to check your ego at the door because this job requires a very specific emotional contract. My philosophy has always been that when everything goes perfectly, congratulations to the team, but if something goes wrong, I am the first one asking myself \"what did I miss?\" You have to be willing to be the umbrella that gets wet so the team can stay dry.\n\nHowever, the flip side of that warning is understanding what \"success\" actually looks like in this career. It isn't a trophy or public applause. For me, the best reward has always been simply that a company is willing to deposit their trust (and their money) in my skills again. The ultimate compliment for a Project Manager when a project is completed isn't a party, it's just the fact that there is another complex project in the queue waiting specifically for you to lead it. If you can find satisfaction in that quiet continuity rather than public glory, you will survive a long time in this game.",

If you don’t thrive on conflict; if you can’t make a team understand and agree on score, budget and schedule, being a PM may not be for you. \n2. All estimates are guesses and all guesses are wrong. You job is to narrow the focus on destines to achieve a “liveable estimate.”\n3. Hold the Account Teams feet to the fire about what has been promised and what has been included in the contract and the SOW. Focus on differences. It’s fine to be a purist and stick strictly to the contract but if the Account Team/Sales gave the customer an expectation of bells and whistles and they are not there, then you face a situation where you have a technically successful project that the customer rejects and you get painted with the “difficult to work with” brush. \n\nI applied a technique that I learned about from my love of Formula 1. If a team suspects another team(s) of cheating, they send the ruling body, the FIA, a fax saying “If we wanted to do this and such to our car in this way related to FIA regulation XY.ZZ, would it be legal?” If the FIA says no then they quietly inform the FIA that they think Team B is doing that. \n\nSo I would communicate to all saying “The contract addresses this functionality as blah, but the SOW states that the functionality is blah plus B. If the final functionality achieved blah plus B minus, without schedule or budget impact, would that satisfy the requirements?”  \n\nThe response then goes into change control. \n\nAnd, finally, if you don’t thrive on conflict…yeah, I said that before. But to add to it, you need to do your homework to make sure you understand the issue, know the facts, know the options and can express all this clearly.",

Based upon my direct experience younger generation are missing fundamental and core competency project management skills because they seem to be heavily focused on the use of systems and AI to do their job but I also believe this has also been clouded with the advent of Agile and people's understanding and poor implementation of it. \n\nAs a total left field, side note or splitting a fine hair perspective, those in construction have their opinions, yes the building of the pyramids had task management but when you start talking formalized project management techniques it started with the GANTT being developed in 1910 and in 1959 had seen the Critical Path Method (CPM) and the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) techniques developed.  PMI wasn't formed in until 1969 and Prince2 originated from Simpact Systems Ltd techniques in 1975 and under licensed to the British Government allowed PROMPT to be developed, which then became the basis of Prince2 as we know it now\n\nAlso formal project management approaches where also more recognised and utilised within the manufacturing industry rather than the building industry back in the early 60's because of the necessity of prototyping, in which manufacturing became very reliant on the technique but it was also became the fundamental principle of the Agile framework.   \n\nSorry for the walk down memory lane but I actually think it's really important to understand how formalized project management techniques have been developed over the years, hence my statement of software applications is just not project management.",

And once something important is gone, whether it’s focus, clarity or your own energy, it’s incredibly hard to get it back.\n\nNow there’s usually one thing I’m very deliberate about protecting, even if it makes me look less flexible than I used to be. Not in an ego way, more in a “this is what keeps the project alive” way. It took a few painful lessons to figure out what that thing is for me.\n\nWhat’s the one thing you learned the hard way to stop giving away so easily? ",

You don’t need to over complicate this, just choose a good sample size for te different types of projects by complexity (see below).\n\nI’d aim to;\n\n1. Use real data and feedback (from previous SMEs) to identify key insights and learnings.  Which parts of the projects are working well (validate these) and which need improvements?\n\n2. Focus on processes - do you have clear and simple steps for your projects, are they standardised, and are they documented, communicated and understood by all participants? \n\n3. structure/roles - are these clearly defined and understood.  Have you identified all key roles for the projects you run, and are each roles responsibilities/duties documented?\n\n4. Do you have the best possible people (resources) with the best matching skills (technical, non technical) to perform these roles?  You definitely need a dedicated PM. Need a Sponsor (key decision maker/influencer), Business Analyst (ensure scope and business requirements defined and understood, ensures IT Solution design and build is aligned), Lead IT Engineer (Arch), Developers, Testers, business SMEs.\n\n5. Tools review - tools are important, but they are there to support processes and the users, and choose a set that best supports your projects.  Keep it simple and effective.  The MS suite is adequate (including Teams, SharePoint), but you can optionally add Jira (for Agile dev projects), Trello (visual tracking) and Confluence (online content documentation).\n\n6. Most importantly, Identify and prioritise list of improvements, and develop an implementation plan for execution.  This includes assigning owners to Actions. \n\nHere’s some questions to help:\nA) Do you have pre-defined steps to deliver your projects?\nB) Can your projects be categorised based on complexity of delivery, eg. Simple, Standard, Challenging, High Risk?  You may only find that you only have two of these.  Choose whatever suits.\nC) Do you have key quality checkpoints throughout your project steps (aka Gates)\nD) Do I know my top key risk areas and have I built in enough contingencies to mitigate these, eg. Resource capacity, task duration, 10-20% budget, tight scope management (limit creep), key dependencies, gates for approvals, etc.\n\nHope this helps, and good luck.",

I started referencing similar projects TRACs for our estimates and made sure we at least quoted that (unless something could be somewhat reused). \n\nThe other issue is our boss and owner restrained us from planning too far ahead while quoting, but also generally thought quotes were too high based on his vibes. This meant scope became more detailed after the quote was sent, which also led to overruns.\n\nThe only times we've had good budgets is when we were able to do all our planning before the quote, but that does mean racking up 20 or more hours that we might not be able to bill if the project doesn't get accepted. I still think this is better than being in a position to be 50, 100, or more hours over.\n\nThe other issue is clients often don't want to be explicit during the quoting process. Even if scope creeps up because of their lack of detail during quoting (no matter how detailed my questioning), that doesn't mean we won't be blamed.\n\n(I notice that clients are especially resistant to wanting to spell out max numbers of quantifiable deliverables, which is absolutely necessary for an accurate quote. If they don't give that to us, we have to assume—and corporate leadership may restrain me from specifying max deliverables in X category of the quote because they're concerned it won't get accepted if that limit is imposed.) \n\nThe basics of overages fall into the broader category that the people with the most power to either estimate/approve the time (technical staff and corporate leadership responsible for sales respectively) or to detail the scope (client) don't want the responsibility to do so, and the responsibility falls onto the PM even though they don't have control (that would be whoever controls sales/contracts). Wherever responsibility is divorced from power and control, it will produce conflicts, both internally and with clients.",

Literally I would graph the actual spend on the same chart as the forecasted spend.\n\nIt was a lot of work but it was the only way I ever figured out to successfully manage project spend in a budget sensitive environment.\n\nQuestion: do you have access to real-time (or at least weekly) project spend data?  If not, then that's a problem and your management needs to be made aware that you need that, at a minimum, to do your job.",

A part-time PM may not be sufficient for this type of complexity. An experienced senior Program Manager with experience in portfolio and strategic planning should be able to add significant value.\n\nSpeaking from experience as a Lead Program Manager, I’ve been brought into initiatives facing similar challenges. In those situations, I was able to reassess budgets and timelines and bring greater clarity to delivery expectations. As others have mentioned, technical teams will often provide high-level SWAG estimates, which can create risk if they are not validated.\n\nIn several cases, I pulled teams back into a structured planning phase to better understand the true scope of work, and 95% of the time that is where I uncover that the original scope was incomplete or inaccurate, causing budget and resource issues. On some agile projects, I’ve found it necessary to apply a more waterfall-style planning approach upfront to establish realistic budgets and timelines before execution.",

Different people notice different things, prioritize differently and need different kinds of clarity to move confidently. Once I stopped expecting everyone to operate the same way, a lot of frustration quietly disappeared.\n\nThat shift didn’t mean lowering standards. It meant being clearer about what actually matters and more deliberate about what I ask for instead of assuming it will just happen.

I’m struggling with getting certain individuals on the team to take their stake in the project seriously and make progress on their deliverables because their own managers are not taking the project seriously and are giving them other priorities despite the fact that our site leader has made it clear that this project should be everyone’s priorities. \n\nAlso, some of their managers (2 of them specifically) constantly push back when they find out their direct report has certain items assigned to them and they argue that “it shouldn’t fall on them, it should be owned by the project team” referring to literally me and my boss as “the project team”. The feedback makes no sense and I am in a situation where I’m essentially professionally begging these people to do their work as assigned for the project, and when we kicked off the project, they were literally on the list of project team members so they ARE on the project but their managers are acting like they are not and purposely trying to minimize the work given to them related to the project. I just don’t understand the baseless pushback. I’m at the point where I feel like I need to bring my boss into this and have him tie the noose around some of these managers because I’m getting very clear vibes these people have made 0 progress on their items and they have multiple deliverables due in 2 weeks.\n\nI found out one particular person who had since September to complete some of their items, did not start on their items until mid-December cause their direct manager kept prioritizing them away from the project. A mentor of mine told me not to worry since they still have like 2 weeks left to complete their stuff, suggesting I shouldn’t raise the flag and give feedback until I actually see that they missed their deadline, but they are dragging their feet and not inspiring confidence at all. I’ve been extremely clear with what’s needed and by when.\n\nAnyways, I’m very very frustrated. What am I supposed to do since I have 0 authority over these people as none of them are my actual direct reports?? How do I incentivize these people to do their work when I’m not even their manager and their own managers aren’t stepping in when I need them to be?",

Why are you getting to know so late that the resource didn’t start their work in September?\n5. As a PM, you should escalate to the manager of these resources, clearly highlighting that the expected work has not been completed, let the manager respond with the reason. Also, make sure to let them know that the reports on the project progress is going to senior management as well. ESCALATE to the manager’s manager if required\n6. I’d suggest you should send a weekly report of senior leadership and include all project resources and their managers, highlight all risks/issues. Give RAG status.

And once you start feeling like you’re begging, that’s usually a sign the setup is broken, not that you’re doing something wrong.\n\nIn situations like this, I stopped treating deadlines as promises and started treating them as checkpoints. I don’t wait until the due date anymore, because by then it’s already too late to do anything useful.  \nI check in early and often, but very concretely. Not “how’s it going,” but “what’s done so far” and “what’s the next thing you’re working on.”\n\nWhat you described with someone having months and only starting in December is exactly why I don’t buy the “they still have two weeks left” advice. Time left doesn’t tell you anything. Progress does. If nothing meaningful has moved, I assume there’s risk, even if the deadline technically hasn’t been missed yet.\n\nWhen priorities conflict with their line manager, I also stopped trying to solve that one-on-one.  \nThat’s not your fight to win. I document what’s assigned, what’s not moving, and why. Then I bring that to my boss or the sponsor early, framed as “here’s what’s at risk if nothing changes,” not as a complaint about people.\n\nIt feels uncomfortable at first, especially when you’re new, because escalation sounds like failure.  \nBut I’ve learned that waiting quietly and hoping things improve actually causes way more damage later.",

Same previous PM who I go to for advice told me to not worry until this person actually does not deliver by the due date I’ve given them which is in early January. Like ok…but I still worry though because this behavior is unacceptable team member behavior (it’s kind of like learned helplessness but it’s also their own manager’s doing for essentially not allowing them to prioritize their project work).",

Usually, \"the most important project for the company\" turns out to (possibly) being the most important for the department - but it is in the 30-50th position for the company, and at least halfway down when filtering on project affecting the team.\n\nThe PMs get disappointed of course, but I tell them exactly which projects they need upper management to deprioritize for their project to go ahead in the queue.\n\nDepending on your company's setup you need to have a conversation with the affected manager and understand why (s)he is deprioritizing your project; not unlikely because of other projects are having higher priorities, needing to complete the delivery of an already committed project, or the team's resources being occupied on unplanned unrelated projects.\n\nBe blunt. Ask for answers. If there's a mismatch in opinions about whether or not resources have been committed to the project or not, you have to prove your opinion from protocols or raise it accordingly.",

IS is when you have the experience but have formed a doubt.\nYes, you may have skills and competency level gaps, as you’re changing your role, but it sounds more like anxiety due to change.\nI propose the following;\n1. identify and list the skills required to do your role (soft, technical, processes) - consult with your manager \n2.  self assess yourself on skills “honestly” for your competency levels, and then \n3. Develop a 30-60-90 days training program to bridge the skill gaps, and validate those that you’re already strong on \n4. Prioritise item 3 - based on the specific requirements of your new role (ask your manager).  Some gaps will be more important to bridge than others in the short/medium term.\n5. Execute items 3 and 4\n6. Be careful on how honest you are about your skill gaps - as unfortunately this can be used against you\n7. Be quietly confident\n8. Know your stuff\nGood luck !!",

I’ve only been in roofing for 5 years and have fast tracked from a roof inspector to field engineer to roof tech to superintendent to currently training as a PM. There’s a lot I still don’t know. That’s the first thing I accepted. The second thing I accepted is that I’m going to make mistakes. The third thing I’ve accepted is that I’m going to learn from those and that I will always have a solution to whatever mistake/hurdle I run into.\n\nSpeaking from the psychology side- the brain doesn’t like change. Change is scary. Change is never a bad thing though as a change typically means better paths and brighter futures. The way I got past self doubt and imposter syndrome: is to be successful at being a good PM. When you start knocking jobs, you catch stuff in preconstruction, when a call you make goes your way- then you go… damn, I can do this. 90% of your success will come in preconstruction. This is where the mistakes happen. Put in the extra time before the project and it can save you hours during the job. What I lack in experience I’ve made up for with hard work. Don’t fake it til you make it. Put the extra time to learn on your own and set yourself up for success. You can’t be an imposter if you are doing it!",

          "text": "Hi and congrats on the new role — that’s a big step, and the fact your managers handed it to you means they already see something in you that you’re probably not giving yourself credit for right now.\n\nI’ve watched a ton of technical folks go through exactly what you’re feeling: dying to get out of pure IC work and into leadership, finally getting the shot, and then immediately wondering if they just made a huge mistake. That voice saying “I’m not qualified” is loud as hell at the start. Totally normal.\n\nHere’s what actually helps when you’re the “new” Scrum Master coming from tech:\n\n- Your technical background is a massive advantage, not a liability. You’ll understand dependencies, effort, and blockers way better than a lot of certified SMs who’ve never shipped code. The team will trust you faster because you speak their language.\n\n- First couple sprints, don’t try to be the expert facilitator. Just focus on running clean ceremonies and shielding the team from noise. Ask more questions than you give answers. The confidence comes from doing it a few times, not from day one.\n\n- Imposter feelings fade fastest when you rack up small wins: one good retro, one blocker you personally removed, one planning session that didn’t drag on forever. Stack those and the doubt quiets down on its own.\n\n- Protect your own time early. New SMs often overcompensate with extra hours to “prove” themselves. Don’t. Set boundaries from week one — it earns more respect than burning out.\n\nYou’re on the exact path most accidental PMs take to get good. This role is the bridge.\n\nIf you want a simple set of tools and templates that take the guesswork out of the people/process side let me know.  (stuff that’s helped a bunch of tech-to-SM folks feel grounded quick), I put one together specifically for situations like yours and mine.\n\nYou’ve got this. First week will feel weird, second week less so, and by sprint three you’ll wonder why you were stressed.\n\nWhat part feels most out of your comfort zone right now — running ceremonies, handling stakeholders, or something else?

Made spreadsheets ranking features, watched comparison videos, read reviews, tried free trials of 8 different platforms. Finally picked one, used maybe 20% of its features, switched 3 months later because it felt too complex. Wasted weeks on a decision that barely mattered.\n\nThe actual answer nobody wants to hear: just pick something decent and move on. Your choice of tools will not make or break your business. Execution matters 100x more than whether you picked Notion versus ClickUp, ConvertKit versus Mailchimp, Linear versus Asana. Most founders fail because they never ship, not because they picked the wrong project management tool.\n\nHere's what actually works: ask one person already successful in your space what they use, copy their stack exactly, don't think about it again for 6 months. When I finally did this for my second product, I asked a founder at $15K MRR what tools he used. He said Notion for everything, ConvertKit for email, that's it. I copied him. Saved 2 weeks of research, tools worked fine, focused on actually building instead of optimizing my tool stack.\n\nThe tool comparison trap is procrastination disguised as productivity. Feels like you're making progress researching the \"best\" CRM, but you're actually avoiding the hard work of talking to customers and shipping features. Most tools at similar price points do basically the same thing with different interfaces. Pick one, learn it deeply, ship your product.\n\nFound this pattern studying 300+ founders in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org), successful ones spent maybe 2 hours total choosing their initial stack and years building their product. Failed founders spent weeks optimizing tools they barely used. The best tool is whichever one you'll actually use consistently. Stop researching, start shipping. You can always switch later if it actually matters, which it rarely does.",

I build out the delivery and project management processes, etc. with whatever tools are currently in place.  9 times out of ten issues aren’t caused by software but by people and/or processes.  \n\nAfter my processes are stable and people are working together as they should then it’s pretty easy to look and see *specifically* what you want a tool to do to increase efficiency, lower overhead, fill gaps, etc.  \n\nThat then becomes the “requirements” for my tool selection.\n\nI generally agree with the points you raise in your post but the flip side is you can definitely undermine productivity by picking the wrong tool prematurely.  \n\nPart of the reason why is, once a tool is picked (money is spent, licenses are bought, training occurs, there’s an emotional commitment to the decision being right, etc.) it’s very difficult to reverse that decision and, if you pick the tool early on, you end up building your processes around how the tool works instead of how your organization works.\n\n If it’s the wrong tool (not a “bad” tool, a perfectly good tool can still just be the wrong one for your specific org) you end up baking in inefficiencies, overhead and potentially problems.",

It teaches you what you might miss when you're operating in the real world, and why there are certain things you shouldn't gloss over just because at first blush they may seem impractical. PMBOK7 has a chapter on tailoring. No advice or book is ever going to 100% match your situation.

When reading these books you need to understand what works for the author may not work for you, it's why you need to develop your own delivery style because it's based upon what does or doesn't work for you. From experience I've witnesses PM's keep on doing something that failed \"because they read somewhere\", rather than trusting their own judgement on how to approach a problem. \n\nAs a discipline the best way to learn is from practical application but  the key is you need to be actively present and always asking the question of yourself is how can I do things better? Personally I learn from my own experiences but also from my peers in seeing how they approach the same or similar problems when delivering projects. \n\nProject management as a discipline is straight forward as it's about managing your triple constraint of time, cost and scope whilst managing the exception to the triple constraint. As you become a more seasoned PM you learn what is important and what is noise when delivering but what makes a good PM is their skills in strategy, risk management and Emotional Quotient (EQ) or people soft skills, they are the skills that really separate a great PM from others.  \n\nBy all means read what you can but just take it with a grain of salt of what is being suggested as it may or may not work for you. It's part of developing your own style of project management delivery. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

If you do a lot of talking in Slack, the best source of truth is going to be one that can be updated on slack itself through an integration or bot. \n\n\nDon't pick something you can't integrate with Slack; you'll waste a ton of time on change management and it probably won't work. If you can't imagine updating Trello, then there's absolutely no reason to consider MS Project other heavy traditional PPM tools.\n\n\nMonday, Asana are both pretty lightweight with good Slack integration. Probably Trello but I've never tried. Smartsheet is terrible and dated and has poor Slack integration. Spreadsheets aren't great for this either because of the integration issue.\n\n\nBut no, this cannot and should not be done in slack alone.",

If a project practitioner has a properly developed project schedule it should be able to simply demonstrate task, work package, deliverable, product and milestone progress which is easily mappable, regardless of it being a standalone project or program of work. \n\nThis is the fundamental core skill of a project practitioner to be able to track a project's forecast and progress clearly and accurately. A GANTT chart is the only tool that is needed and the rest is on the project manager to understand  in order to deliver and as the PM it's your responsibility to set the priority off a clearly defined schedule. \n\nOP, this is not a direct dig; however, as an old school PM I'm starting to see this more often than not on where fundamental project management skills are weakening with the advent or the over reliance on tool sets to do the job as PM's are being generally over utilised and tool sets seem to be an easier option rather than actually properly planning projects being undertaken as needed.  Also I'm finding in the agile space PM's are starting to disengage with the team unintentionally or inadvertently because of unrealistic or unreasonable work loads and are becoming more \"hands off\" and the symptom of that is not successfully driving the schedule because of the volume of administration that is needed now because of disparate systems and data stores needed within an organisation as organisations and companies have become so data focused.  The GANTT chart is your primary tool, everything else is secondary to you being successful in the delivery of your project, regardless of what toolsets you use. \n\nMaster your core skills and I will guarantee a substantial amount of your issues will resolve themselves, just a reflection point for your consideration. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

Use templates and you can move email in and out of any grown-up PM tool.

Just dandy for you honey-do list at home but not for project management. \n\nChange is hard for people. If your org is emotionally and culturally invested in Slack you have a challenge. Don't take that away. Aside from being the best communication of record, email has the benefit of being simple and familiar. Less pushback.

Even then, there will be holdouts.  When I first started in project management, I had MS Project but nobody else tracked their work in a tool - not projects or day-to-day work - and nobody was paying for EVERYONE to have a license for MS Project.  This meant manual updates that often involved chasing after people for status.  As work management tools became more popular, people started tracking their work in the tools, but they weren't project management tools, and they weren't going to update project tasks in a separate tool from the one they were using for their regular work.  More manual updates and chasing after people.\n\nToday, work management tools have more project management features and they're much better for collaboration, but you're going to need someone to manage the tool.  If you're outgrowing Slack, you need to prepare for this.  Until then, some things you can do are:\n\n* Use Slack Lists to track project tasks with assignees and due dates; use workflows to send alerts\n* Require whomever is posting tasks with deadlines to tag ('@') the individuals responsible for the task\n* Use reminders ('/remind') for yourself and others\n* Schedule messages to go at specific times using the dropdown next to the send button",

It’s a standardized exam, so strategy tends to matter 50+% of the time. PMI is emphasizing soft skills more-and-more in their content and AR’s content helps. Answers on the exam that practice strong “emotional intelligence” should stand out as the possible answer during process of elimination. \n\nSecondly, remember that a good portion of the exam questions are not graded. They are “pilot” questions that the PMI is (ironically) testing to see if they are viable for future test they plan to administer. Any question that makes you go “wtf is this?!” is often one of those questions. Don’t let it get to you. Follow your instinct on those and move on. \n\nThirdly, get the PMI Agile Practice Guide. Alongside soft-skills, the PMI is skewing more-and-more towards Agile and Hybrid methodologies. Agile gave me a hard time in the exam because I had little exposure to it in my career up to that point. Become very familiar with Agile and Hybrid terminology. Standardized exams often don’t explicitly state the questions context/environment - they test the examiners ability to deduce that through keyword hints. \n\nLastly (ish), when in doubt, follow some classic rules:\n- The words “might”, “may”, etc are risks.\n- Anything that “did” or “has” happened are issues. \n- “Next” steps in a process. They are testing your process knowledge. The next step is the option that you would run into next if you followed the process exactly/literally. If they give you Step 3 in Phase C and the answer choices are Step 2 in Phase B, Step 7 in Phase C, Step 1 in Phase D or Step 5 in Phase C…Choose Step 5 in Phase C. \n- Always assess first. \n- Always gather the group to discuss\n- 99% of the time you’ll never choose the answers that stop/kill the project, escalate to execs, or add more resources. If you aren’t sure of the answer and these extreme choices are next to choices that involve assessing first, gathering the team, etc, then choose one of the latter. \n\nLastly lastly, don’t drive yourself nuts thinking about or fearing the “exceptions”. Exam questions always test a few exceptions, but those questions are always in the minority. Keep an eye out, but don’t hunt for exceptions. Follow the rules of the game, inject your instinct, answer, then move on. \n\nYou’ll pass. Take a break, regroup and then take a fresh approach. We have your back!\n\nEdit: basic typos.",

Make sure you are doing all of the quizzes (at least once) and I don’t think you need to do more than a few tests, but save at least one for a few days before the test and give yourself a day or two to mentally decompress before hand or you’ll just stress out cramming. \n\nThird3rock PMP guide is also very popular on the PMP subreddit.

I always tell my team (who need stuff from other teams) that if someone tells you \"we'll get to it\" it never gets done. \n  \n- One \"psychological trick\" I use is to have them come up with the date, so if I need it in 2 weeks, I'll say \"Does next week work? Or a bit more time?\", they'll say \"Maybe two weeks?!\", I'll say great, what date works best, they say \"Last day of week 2\".  \n  \nNow that works, until it doesn't. How do you deal with a situation where John keeps making excuses? Like \"I was blocked by team Y\" or \"I was ready but some new crazy error occurred and I couldn't get it done and I had to troubleshoot\". I understand stuff happens but how you deal with this, especially considering that John probably waited until the day before to even begin the task? \n  \nI don't want to go to their manager, I want quality work from John, I don't want to ruin the relationship. But how can I get them to sort of be on my side and do what needs to be done without being aggressive, going to their manager, or micromanaging their progress?",

          "text": "Can I suggest in not setting a false date in order to deliver on time. An approach would be to set a hard date but you also set up \"progress status reporting\" and that would be depending on the priority and complexity of the task and if there are any interdependencies e.g for a task in two weeks set the hard date and a status report could be set up with just a simple email confirmation on progress and the check in could be set at 1 week out, 3 days and 1 day prior to due date. If it was a high priority with high interdependencies then set it for every day.\n\nAs an example, I required 120 virtual servers to be built as a high priority deliverable and I contacted the T/L first to see it the task was achievable within 6 week period (it was our standard lead time), and it was confirmed that the server team could build them. Because of my hard date I raised the request and spoke with the assigned resource that day, I checked in weekly and in the final week I checked daily. The deliverable was missed, but it gave me the ability to come down hard on the Team Lead and the resource because the allocated resource lied to me and the team lead failed to track effort and over utilised the resource.\n\nYes I can hear you say but they failed to deliver but here is the kicker, after escalation the fallout was immense but here is the thing, it never happened again as both the Team Lead and the technical resource learnt a very public lesson. The thing that nailed them was the progress status update report because I had clearly documented the facts and it was the very thing that sunk them. Just a consideration for reflection. It also taught me a valuable lesson in the process in progress status reporting. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

For example:\n-> For company A, I’m working on adding new features to an existing ERP system\n-> For company B, I’m developing two fairly complex tools (a Chrome extension and a VS Code extension)\n-> For company C, I’m coordinating a small team that’s building a BI / analytics dashboard\n-> On that last one, I’m more on the functional side: translating business needs into concrete tasks for data analysts and tracking progress\n-> On top of all that, I’m also trying to move forward on a side SaaS project of my own\nLately, I’ve been feeling kind of lost:\n-> I sometimes forget where I left off on a project\n-> I miss messages or reply late to people on my team\n-> Context switching all day is exhausting\n-> Even with tasks written down, things still slip through the cracks\nI’ve tried Trello, basic task managers, notes, etc., but none of them really give me that “big picture” view. I’m missing a clear way to see:\n-> What I’m responsible for right now\n-> Where each project actually stands\n-> Who I need to follow up with\n-> What truly deserves my attention today\nIf you’re juggling multiple clients or roles:\n-> How do you organize everything?\n-> One main tool or several?\n-> Any workflows, systems, or habits that helped long-term?\nWould really appreciate hearing what’s worked (or not) for you.",

          "text": "Hey I feel you. At one point I was managing/leading 15 projects. However, stopping there would make it sound worse than reality. I would list the following points that kept me sane :) :\n\n- I spent more time preparing during pre-kickoffs. Aligning on the scope and final deliverables, getting to know the clients and their priorities, how they like to communicate (this is important as some want more regular touch base meetings others, a message on Slack would be more than enough, one prefers slides, other technical demos, etc). This helps me have a solid ground to start from.\n\n- The first two weeks are essential and will require a good amount of time. You get to know your team. Here it is time to build trust and openness among your team members. They are the experts and I'm there to support them and move away any roadblock (unclear expectations, too much meetings, etc). My goal is to build autonomy and ownership. this is key and will give you peace of mind later on.\nAlso, always boost their confidence and praise them when doing good work internally and Infront of the clients, while addressing their mistakes privately. This builds trust and makes them want to do better (we all need to feel appreciated. This helped me a lot because I know that when things go wrong they will reach out to me first (you need that!)\n\n- In terms of meetings I had one call a week with the engineers/developers (internal) and one where we meet with the client. That was more than enough. However, I also ensured that we communicate on the project Slack properly and regularly updates and issues. I usually have many messages to follow up on. I usually read them as soon as they are shared then mark them \"Unread\" and set a reminder on them. This helps me stay focus on what I'm doing and set my priorities on what to repond on now vs things that can wait.\n\n- This is ovbious but worth mentioning :). I had a board for every project with milestones set. Some are common among all projects and others are specific requirements to a given project that we need to achieve. This kept me on track and made me divide my efforts accordingly.\n\n- And finally I trusted my instinct and communicated any concerns or questions with my team (developers and clients). I have never regretted it.\n\nAlso what really helped me is connecting with my team members and being more relaxed and curious about what they are doing. I loved learning about all the great things they were doing. \n\nI hope this helps and I wish you all the best!",

I manage projects myself, and I manage multiple contractors who are doing projects for the org. So I’ll speak as both a nonprofit employee and a volunteer.\n\nFirst and foremost, THANK YOU for even considering volunteering! Small nonprofits are often understaffed and under resourced. Your time is such a huge contribution.\n\nNow to (hopefully) answer your question…\n\nI’d start with asking the executive director (ED) what the needs are, determine what YOU have the bandwidth for, and then you can decide if you want to get involved or not. That would be the first step. As someone with little PM experience, I’d ask for smaller projects and work your way up to bigger projects.\n\nAfter you figure out which project you’re interested in, get everything in writing. Create a plan, a timeline, deliverables, and budget (if you need a budget to get it done). Present it to the ED to make sure you’re both on the same page and everything is clear. Know who your point of contact will be and what supports you’ll need from the org/ED. This will keep you organized and on-track; you’ll have something to refer to as you work through the project.\n\nFor every ‘milestone’ or phase on your timeline, do a check-in so the ED can catch any revisions early on. Actually, having regular check-ins would be beneficial, period. Below is a screenshot of a timeline and implementation plan to give you an idea. (Sorry, had to block out the project components!) I add each due date to my calendar to keep me on track.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvino3t2qubg1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=536517ecfeed2a92bbb8e72f215ee179e21212e9\n\nI use Trello (it’s what my org was already working with), but there are others out there like Asana, Monday, etc. I watched YouTube to make sure I knew how to maximize my use of Trello. You can automate tasks, add due dates, and add team members (like the ED) so that they can check your progress and collaborate without having to email/call you all the time.\n\nI’d say the best PMs/contractors I work with are hands down good communicators—they provide clarity, meet deadlines, hold themselves accountable, stay organized, and are proactive. They break down their work/language so the ‘client’ understands exactly what’s happening. They ask questions to get clarity, provide updates, and are realistic about what they can/can’t do.\n\nThis might be a bit much, but this has been my experience having to wear ALL the hats at my org 😅\n\nGood luck, thank you, and YOU GOT THIS!",

      "text": "So I work as an engineer, I manage a small team and I've usually just tracked things using Jira/Excel.

And why do you use it over others? Can you use it for personal goals too (losing weight, moving to a new city, etc)?  \n \n2) In terms of things like collecting info, tracking tasks, making sure stuff actually gets done, and not losing the plot when there are a million moving parts...how do you manage all this without feeling overwhelmed? What do you tell yourself when you are overwhelmed or confused as to next steps, etc?   \n \n3) Any tools in particular you'd recommend that help?  \n  \n4) Last one is a bit of a bonus question, but I'm curious if you ever explore frameworks/methodologies from other industries to accomplish tasks or if that's overkill.

Can you use it for personal goals too (losing weight, moving to a new city, etc)?\n\nBy preference I use rolling wave which is a waterfall variant. You have an overall plan end-to-end that establishes a cost, schedule, and performance baseline. In preparation for each control gate you flesh out the details to the following control gate. This is NOT Agile. Planning for a two week sprint is not a plan. \n\n>2. In terms of things like collecting info, tracking tasks, making sure stuff actually gets done, and not losing the plot when there are a million moving parts...how do you manage all this without feeling overwhelmed? What do you tell yourself when you are overwhelmed or confused as to next steps, etc?\n\n1,200 people working over five years on a massive program worth 100s of millions of dollars doesn't have a million moving parts. A million is a lot. Don't overstate things. Organizational structure (WBS, RBS) is a huge help. Roll-ups and roll-downs. Simple reporting to the plan. Don't force people to use tools they don't normally work with. Collect status and costs in sync. Timesheet day is status day. That's usually Fridays. If you don't have a consolidated view by 1000 Monday morning you're doing something wrong. \n\nAnyone who asks a question gets the latest weekly report. No special runs for anyone. Same report for everyone. If you tailor different reports for internal team, management, customer, customer management you're lying to someone.\n\n>3. Any tools in particular you'd recommend that help?\n\nSoftware can't do your job for you. You have to know what you are doing. The current generation of PM \"tools\" are universally bad. Jira is not a PM tool no matter what Atlassian marketing tells you. It's good for operations e.g. help desk or anything that is a good fit for an SLA but not for PM. Agile is not PM. My first major PM role (not in charge) was an aircraft carrier we managed out of a war room with floor to ceiling white boards. I could run a pretty big program on toilet paper with a Sharpie. I don't want to, but I could. Software is a big help if you know what you're doing. Scitor Project Scheduler, MS Project, Primavera.\n\n>4. Last one is a bit of a bonus question, but I'm curious if you ever explore frameworks/methodologies from other industries to accomplish tasks or if that's overkill. Like do you ever look into how Japan built it's economy so quickly, or how a strong military country plans projects and executes tasks, or look into the psychology of people who are really good at planning/tracking projects?\n\nJapan is easy. Deming. Military (I have experience with US, UK, NOR, and NL) is classic PM. Plan the work and work the plan. In my experience failures especially overruns and delays are people failures not process failures. \n\nThings change with time. PMI drank the Agile Kool-Aid and the PMBOK is not as useful as it once was. MIT OpenCourseware is pretty good. Just skip over the Agile bits.",

Honestly which one you choose doesn't really matter, none of them are perfect but it gets you into a way of thinking that will really help. \n\nThe most powerful PM tool IMO remains the weekly whole-team update email (starting with exec summary line). Everyone appreciates them and anyone gently called out as owing you some deliverable will usually \"find some time for it\" surprisingly quickly.",

Wrong epistemic view on how we know whats needed and what works: While it is true that activities must happen in time, understanding does not progress linearly.\nThe most important knowledge—about users, feasibility, and value—often emerges only after partial solutions exist.

Adaptation is an exception and not THE process. Stage-gated processes structurally reinforce cognitive biases such as the \"sunk cost fallacy,\" because abandoning or significantly revising completed stages involves admitting to misallocated resources or wasted effort, resulting in inertia. A more “cyclical adaptive” Product view limits sunk costs by making adaptations psychologically and practically easier to enact. Stage-gated frameworks inherently create resistance to responsiveness, even if they claim flexibility through change-request mechanisms.\n\nA useful lens to view Product Management (when being a PjM or a traditionally schooled manager) is to see it as a pure risk management activity as being its sole purpose (not an element of it)",

During this time, I was really clicking with the PM because I was learning and eager to help, and they voiced some insecurity in the specific sector of PMing (lol). I first noticed, during the audit, that the PM would pose a question to me about a process, I'd dig and find the solution and they'd present it as their own work externally. Initially, I wanted to name it but I was green so I didn't vocalize my frustration in that. \n\nNow, months and months later, this same PM does the same thing on an even bigger scale by deliberately using their role to \"delegate\". I quote that because the delegation is simply off loading work they don't want to do. It's becoming a real problem because if I question the task ownership, my question is escalated as non-compliance and then it's all turned back on me. \n\nI say anxious because that's exactly what it is. I can best describe it as pacing. Even though we mainly work remotely, I can feel the anxiety in the repeated messages, the constant tinkering with established and trusted processes, and passive aggressive behavior. Their leadership style is also very anxiously asking, not being assertive until questioned and then blame shifts. \n\nThe behavior is noticed by other team members but they essentially can ignore it because of the minimal contact they have with the PM, unlike me. \n\nI'm open to hearing how you all would navigate this. I've been empathizing with the workload and potential burnout on the PM but that's not an excuse for the behavior towards me. ",

The PM never attended those series of trainings, even with my reminders that they were mandatory for them. \n\nI didn't want to get too specific but the financial tasks that I was interested in were very specific to the overall project and industry. Nonetheless, I stopped asking the PM about the ins and outs because I didn't want it to be dumped on me like before. \n\nThe points of escalation aren't flat out \"xyz is not doing _ task when I ask\", it's more weaponized incompetence and said like \"__ task needs to be done, I'm not sure who does it, but I think xyz (me) can handle it\". This has been done with my line manager, the project director and even executive level. The PM has even agreed to complete a task, ask me to provide the standardized verbiage stating that PMs are the owners of said task, escalated it, and received a reply that PM owns but can pass on completion of the task to anyone else, and then placed the task back on me to complete.

      "text": "I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately, especially after a few projects that didn’t really end with a clean win. Nothing catastrophic but also nothing you’d proudly point to and say “that was a success”. And yet, some of those projects still felt… worth it.\n\nIt made me realize that the sense of meaning rarely comes from perfect outcomes. It comes from smaller, quieter things that don’t show up in reports. Moments where a team handled a tough situation honestly. Where people spoke up early instead of letting things rot. Where someone grew into responsibility they didn’t think they were ready for. Or where the work stayed human, even under pressure.\n\nI’ve also noticed that when work feels meaningless, it’s often not because the goal was bad but because the process drained everything out of it. Endless urgency, zero reflection, decisions made without context, people treated like interchangeable parts. Even a successful delivery can feel empty if it got there that way.\n\nSo, when you look back at your work, what actually made it feel meaningful to you, even when the result wasn’t perfect or the project didn’t fully land?

Your legal people and your insurance company will have fits. \n\nJira is not project management software no matter what Atlassian marketing says. It's ops software. Fine for help desk or other SLA applications, not for projects. \n\nI can't speak to Zoho Project. I've never heard of the company. \n\nSoftware can't do you job for you. You have to know what you're doing^(TM).\n\nYou wrote you want to create tasks in your tool. Jira can do that. I can't speak to Slack integration. \n\nFor project management you need planning to develop an end to end cost, schedule, and performance aka scope baseline against which status is measured. You must track dependencies between tasks. You need risk management. You want your PM tool to talk to your financial tool (presumably Zoho One) through an API. Duplicate data entry is prone to error. Don't do that. You need to be collecting timesheets - that's in Zoho Projects, Zoho People, and Zoho Invoice. Status should be collected at the same time as timesheets for synchronization. \n\nSalesforce claims you can [manage projects directly in Slack](https://slack.com/solutions/project-management). They're lying of course (no planning, no baseline). You could manage for a while with some in-house spreadsheets. \n\nYou need to buy, rent, or train a real PM. I suggest you focus on buy or rent as the scar tissue of a good, experienced PM is not something you can get from a boot camp. You want someone who will guide you to a roadmap for the future that supports PM without forcing more change on people than absolutely necessary.",

(the executive need to make an informed financial and strategic decision based up the design and ensuring that they're not investing poorly)?\n* Then and only then after your business/project approval do you map your requirements to a platform or product.\n\nTo do this any other way as an organisation you run the very real risk of not having a fit for purpose product or failed product because it doesn't do in what it needs to do and users start looking for work arounds or not use the system at all and you end up with an expensive white elephant.

We have a project budget broken down by month and phase, but we aren’t estimating our projects at a task level. Estimates are derived based on labor % and estimated # of months. I’m getting confused on how I could calc EV with the way my company has their estimates set up. ",

This is a cultural and corporate shift that needs to take place around any project delivery framework. \n\nThe only thing you will do by using EV independently of your peers is show the immaturity of your organisation's project delivery framework and I'm going to say with a fair amount of certainty is that your projects are not going be as profitable as you think they might be. Based upon experience all you're essentially doing is making another KPI rod for your own back when there is no corporate buy in, particularly when it's not an SOP or an organisational approach to managing project health. \n\nFor the record I've used EV for most of my career working in the professional services space and I believe it's a great way to track project performance but my suggestion would be is to concentrate on your own WBS and make it as accurate as possible and ensure the effort expended on the project is correct and tracked closely to ensure that you can accurately compare forecasts and actuals. As an example, when I create my schedules I can break down the entire schedule into task, work packages, products and deliverables. Yes it can be painful at times especially for a program but I can say with hand on heart exactly what my forecast and actuals are at the end of the project/program and I can break them down into their respective attributes as needed on an analytical review.  Also another consideration is you could be perceived as rocking the boat by your peers which could add a further dynamic to your working relationships, especially if it creates perceived notation of an additional administration overhead from your PM peers and colleagues, just a reflection point for you to consider.  \n\nJust an armchair perspective",

Based upon experience I can see two outcomes, either your project and program managers start skewing outputs (not truely representing what is actually happening) or the data is not supporting the true levels of organisational immaturity of what is actually going wrong.\n\nHaving a dashboard view is not going to help with project KPI profitabilities when the underlying systems and approaches are broken. By the very nature of what you're doing now is a bandaid fix and an unnecessary cost for your company without addressing the problems or removing any risks, including reputational risk and the latter should be a concerns for your senior executive. \n\nIn reality your PMO team need to provide the executive the analytical data and information to allow them to make an informed decision and if they choose to ignore that then that is on them. I would also say as a PMO practitioner part of the PMO's responsibility to to assist the executive in making these types of decisions from a strategic perspective, so your documented observations need to demonstrate the risk and issues, followed by any recommendations and or approaches that are needed to address the very underlying problems. \n\nDon't get me wrong I appreciate that you're looking for solutions or outcomes but as a PMO practitioner like yourself or your PMO management structure need to outline risk to the executive, as professionals sometimes you do need to present bad news and not just want the executive want to hear, it's the very thing that makes us professional.  I think your management team would be remiss if they failed to outline the problem without the executive taking responsibility. A genuine good luck to you and I hope the process works itself out. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

While your planning and thus budget are deficient, based on your description you should be able to come up with numbers by task. \n\nYou need (NEED) to have a complete estimate. Organize (WBS \\*sigh\\*) so that LOE tasks like PM, security, accounting, BA, facilities and SLA tasks like help desk are not in your EVM baseline. You track SLA tasks against the SLA. Burn rate is fine for LOE (which really shouldn't be more than 8% of total). LOE and SLA which amount to getting EV for showing up and breathing in and out dilute EV and slow down indicators. \n\nYou are collecting timesheets, right? Status reports synced to timesheets? The more you estimate and guess the less value (ha!) from EVM. \n\nI get more help from CPI and SPI curves than tables of EV and PV. Dashboards I've seen are high level and don't support drilling down into the WBS to find risks and issues before they become real problems. \n\nWhile you're working on your WBS, sit down with HR and develop an RBS. \n\nYou may need to rent some help. \n\nI'm a turnaround guy.

Spreadsheets are fine for binary status, but the moment you need actual dates, slippage visibility, and confidence in the data coming from multiple people, they become a liability.\n\nA standard PM system is usually the right move here, but only if you model it correctly. You want each unit x trade x step to be a real schedulable item with planned and actual dates, not just a checkbox. Tools like MS Project or Primavera handle this well from a pure scheduling standpoint, but they can be heavy and painful for weekly updates, especially when you’re only touching 10 percent of the schedule at a time.\n\nLighter tools can work if they support  \nreal plan vs actual dates at the task level  \nparallel work without forcing fake dependencies  \ncritical path visibility without manual hacks  \ncontrolled data entry so updates don’t wreck the model\n\nThe biggest win tends to come from treating this like a template driven system. Define the unit trade step structure once, clone it cleanly, and then lock down what people are allowed to update. If you let updates flow in uncontrolled, accuracy will always drift no matter the tool.\n\nShort version: this is beyond Excel, but you don’t need chaos either. Pick something that respects scheduling math, supports repeatable structures, and doesn’t turn weekly status into a full time job.",

Spreadsheets work for simple status tracking but break down when you need real schedule management with critical path tracking and multiple data sources feeding information.\n\nStandard PM software like MS Project, Primavera P6, or platforms like Monday or Smartsheet are designed exactly for this complexity. They handle dependencies, resource allocation, plan vs actual comparison, and status rollups way better than trying to jury-rig Excel.\n\nFor aerospace project management at this scale, Primavera is probably your best bet if you need serious critical path analysis and enterprise-level controls. MS Project works for mid-complexity projects but might struggle with 1600+ individual tasks (100x4x4) each with 5-7 steps. Monday or Smartsheet are lighter weight but might not give you the critical path management you need.\n\nThe real question is whether you need full critical path scheduling software or just better task tracking and status visualization. If every step dependency truly matters and you're managing float and critical path formally, go with Primavera or MS Project. If you mainly need organized task tracking with better visibility than Excel, lighter platforms might work.\n\nData accuracy from multiple sources is a common problem regardless of platform. The solution isn't just better software, it's clear ownership of status updates, defined update cycles, and buy-in from everyone contributing data. Best software in the world fails if people don't maintain it consistently.\n\nConsider bringing in a project controls specialist or scheduling consultant to set up your system properly. Aerospace projects at this complexity usually have dedicated scheduling resources, not PMs trying to manage it themselves while also running the project.\n\nFor specific tool recommendations from people managing similar aerospace or multi-site construction projects, try posting in project management or aerospace PM forums. They can share what actually works at this scale versus what sounds good but fails in practice.\n\nBottom line: Excel isn't the right tool for this complexity. Invest in proper scheduling software and the expertise to set it up correctly, or you'll keep fighting data accuracy and visibility problems.",

      "text": "TL;DR at the bottom. Thank you in advance from a *very* burnt-out college student. \n\nFor context, I run a fully student-led nonprofit through Discord. Think Slack, but with features geared towards gamers. It's free, widely used by high schoolers (our market), and well-suited to our community. Operations and community are set up in two separate Discord ecosystems, which improves project management. We have about 2,500 students in our community, but our resources have reached as many as 30k in the last two years (January 1st marks the anniversary of our founding!), and we're scaling faster than I expected.\n\nBehind the scenes, though, we consistently struggle with project management. It's not crippling yet, but it's unprofessional and scattered. Due to leadership being student-based (mostly high schoolers) and entirely volunteer-run, accountability is difficult to establish and maintain. I'm a junior in college studying business administration, and as my own expectations and project-management skills improve, the gap between what I know *should* happen and what actually happens has become more obvious.\n\nI care deeply about respecting that this is unpaid work and that real life comes first for everyone involved. That being said, I keep running into the same wall: the students have passion, but often lack the actual skills and follow-through.\n\nPart of this is on me. I've historically taken a very laissez-faire approach to leadership, which is something I'm actively trying to unlearn. As the organization grows, that approach is failing to scale. The lack of structure makes me feel like I'm constantly reacting instead of leading. I've been speaking to professors, and many have echoed sentiments that I'm taking 'servant leadership' too far and I'm becoming a doormat.\n\nI'm open to any advice. This project matters deeply to me, and I know it makes a huge impact on the low-income students we help every day. I don't want it to burn out, but I'm also recognizing that I'm reaching the limits of what I can figure out alone.\n\n*---*\n\n*TL;DR:* I'm a college student running a student-led nonprofit for high schoolers. My project management skills have outpaced our current structure, and the lack of enforceable accountability is becoming unsustainable. I want to respect that everyone involved is a student with IRL priorities, but I'm struggling to balance accommodation with execution. Looking for any advice, no sugarcoating needed.",

Ask them to communicate proactively when their commitment changes and not when they are already struggling to fullfil it.\n\nI think you have a resource management problem, not a PM methodology one. Doesn't matter which system you build if people aren't able to commit to their responsibility. Try to define 'full time ' roles in your projects or organization and see how many volunteers you need to fill those up, depending on how much time they can commit. Plan for the future and anticipate people moving on when they typically reach certain milestones in their studies. Try to already have alternatives in place or prioritize projects so you still focus your resources when they are limited and you don't get a dozen project teams falling apart",

I’ve probably been giving the impression that volunteering means expectations are optional, and that’s something I need to correct. We do have a mix of \"full-time\" and \"part-time\" volunteers already, and the few full-time we have are on it, but they get slammed by work that the part-time times don't fulfill. \n\nThank you for the feedback!",

You may not know what you don't know. \n\nSoftware cannot do your job for you. You have to know what you're doing. That said, software can make your job harder. \n\nIM in general and Discord in particular are very poor as communication of record. Too much gets missed and reconstructing communication and miscommunication becomes a project (ha!) in and of itself. Talk to your college IT people and the academic legal team (not a law school - the people who keep the college out of court) about how they meet requirements for archive and search. You will find that just about everywhere uses email as communication of record. That doesn't mean you can't use Discord for informal and tactical discussion, but anything not in email (or whatever communication of record you choose) didn't happen. Discord is not it. Discord may be fine for outreach to your market. You don't have to use it for substantive communication within your org. \n\nHint: if you're \"burnt out\" as a college student you won't do well in any substantive position. I wish I had the time and flexibility I had in college. I earned two bachelor degrees in four years and went on to earn two masters in three years while working full time plus and having a heavy travel schedule. Working meaningful jobs is much more work. \n\nI have run volunteer organizations while working full time from a small condo association (dozens of volunteers, hundreds of association members) to professional organizations (thousands of volunteers and tens of thousands of members). While there is a certain amount of flexibility necessary managing volunteers aka herding cats, volunteering is a commitment. People need to show up when they are supposed to and finish tasks by due dates. u/lygho1 has it right. \n\nThink about what has been shown to work elsewhere. You aren't doing anything unique or special. You can lift straight out of organizational behavior (OB). I can guarantee that you aren't smarter than W. Edwards Deming. Organizational structure, delegation, reporting, cross-functional communication. Status. You don't have to call expectations SLAs to draw from best practice for SLAs. If someone is a drag on performance s/he has to go. You'll find--if you are correct in your assessment--that morale and performance improves. \n\nVolunteer organizations benefit greatly from Lean Six Sigma. You should get a Yellow Belt out of this if not a Green Belt. That won't hurt your employment prospects any.",

Instead of having a plan managed by a single (or small group) of professional PMs, every person on the team contributes to the plan (including its cost, risk and schedule elements).\n\nWhile high-level goals would still be set by management, and mid-level tasks would be set by those managing customer interfaces (i.e., defining WPs etc) or internal planners, the \"detail\" of a plan would be created, updated and managed by more junior staff, the ones doing the work. They would take ownership of small parts of the plan, define their own tasks within that scope, delegate constituent tasks to others, record progress. They would do this without close inspection by the PMs and more senior staff (at least while they stayed within their scope's budge/timeline/risk level etc). Effectively, your master plan is now directly edited, managed and updated by a large number of people, each responsible for their own defined part of it. \n\nPMs would still be involved to check on the overall status, manage resources, conduct upwards reporting and to resolve trade-offs, but this would be a more passive/reactive role, rather than what I see as the more traditional \"active\" role wherein they are continually updating the plan, and distributing tasks. \n\nAnyone done this? How did it work out? Are there named PM philosophies like this I can read up on? Are there PM tools that accommodate this approach?",

Missing words maybe?\n\nETA after u/rand0anon edited his or her [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1q2t1ut/comment/nxh7ryk/). \n\nI was exposed to this approach in a training offsite in the very early '90s. I'd seen it before that by being included in planning as a junior engineer. The only difference from conventional waterfall or rolling wave planning is the explicit inclusion of implementer representatives in the process. \n\nI've been doing this for more than 40 years. \n\nIt helps to have a template for task instructions: title, WBS, lead, description, resources by RBS, predecessors and successors. For detailed planning more senior review in real time for any task that comes out less than 80 hours or more than 120 hours. For the latter, there may be key tasks that are short but critical and should not be rolled into a larger task. There is no point in breaking down 10,000 feet of welding into small tasks when there are drawings for every inch and inbound steel and outbound scrap are weighed anyway. If you have three coders, an SE, and a SME working full time for three weeks to build and test control code for landing a rocket in a gantry (I have no insight into what it took Space-X to pull that off but I'm impressed) there is not point in breaking that 600 hour task into smaller pieces. The point of review is to make sure there is a good reason for being out of bounds. The higher level planning beyond the next control gate can be hundreds to thousands of hours depending on the quality of your historic information. \n\nThis is all pretty easy in-person. Done remotely you'll need a very stable platform and more facilitators. \n\nWe used this approach in the planning for [LCAC](https://www.navy.mil/Resources/Fact-Files/Display-FactFiles/Article/2170004/landing-craft-air-cushion-lcac/) \\#1. Someone suggested we start building the craft upside down and then flip it over to build the rest. Down hand welding instead of overhead welding saved thousands of labor hours over the course of the contract. I don't remember who had the idea but it was someone who would have never been in the room in a seniors only planning session. \n\nHow can I help?",

Which sounds more likely to work:\n\n1. A PM assigns a larger task to someone. Then they periodically check in on the assignee to ask how they're doing to ensure progress is OK. They have to dig into the the assignee's planning to understand what they're doing and when, to verify that the assignee has thought through the task and decomposed it properly. If further delegation is required, the assignee needs to re-create a project management system to manage the resources assigned to them, and/or needs to put a request for those resources in the first place.\n\n2. A PM assigns a larger task to someone. They then don't need to check in on the person as they can just immediately see how the assignee is tackling the task, how detailed the planning is, and what the progress within that decomposition is. If delegation of work is needed, it can be transparently seen and assigned.\n\nIn both cases, the assignee may need extra pushing to make them handle the mini-PM part of their role. But in the latter case, once they do this then the PM doesn't need to continually chase updates and \"pry information\" out of the assignee. It rewards and encourages good planning and reporting, and the assignee feels like they are contributing to the planning directly, which is empowering.",

I manage dependencies and risks etc, but I work primarily with leads, not with working teams.

It also frees the PM up from routine update-transferring activities, allowing them to look more at the bigger picture. I don't know for sure, but it seems the shorter communications lines might result is less administration hours, not more.\n\nTo be clear, I don't propose getting rid of a PM: someone centralised is still needed to supervise the process, make tradeoffs, maintain schedule/cost discipline etc. If yoiu PM is also your architect/customer interface/systems engineer/manager/whatever, this allows the double-hatting more comfortably.",

This is the project board, sponsor or executive's responsibilities to deal with a poor performing project manager.

All the product owners are from the company that hired us, and all the project managers are contractors like me. And because of that, there’s a complicated dynamic where instead of being collaborative or respectful of one another’s expertise, the product owners run the show and don’t consider the logistics behind their asks. They tell us what to do and when to do it by, and because the PMs are contractors, they’re not in a position to push back when it’s necessary. So I’m left with surprise tasks popping up out of scope that are considered time sensitive and important, and sometimes impossible to do with the time given. Happens on a weekly basis. \n\nLike I said, this type of environment is new to me so I was curious  - how normal is this? Do PMs experience this a lot? Are there ways to resolve these issues?

          "text": "What you’re describing is unfortunately more common than many people admit, especially in contractor-heavy environments and organizations that are “doing Agile” more in name than in practice.\n\nFrom what you shared, a few patterns stand out. The first is governance and power imbalance. When product owners are internal and PMs are contractors, it often creates a weak matrix dynamic (authority is informal, accountability is blurry, and PMs are expected to \"make it work” without real leverage). That tends to show up exactly as you described.\n\nThe second issue is that this doesn’t sound very Agile in spirit. Agile relies on collaboration, respect for roles, transparency, and sustainable pace. If product owners are unilaterally dictating what and when without considering trade-offs, dependencies, or team capacity, then key Agile principles are being bypassed.\n\nOne practical question I’d ask is:  \nDo you have any kind of team charter, working agreements, or clear engagement model?  \nEven lightweight agreements: (how work enters the system, how priorities are set, what “urgent” really means, and how capacity is respected) can dramatically reduce this kind of chaos. If those don’t exist, that’s often the root cause.\n\nSome potential avenues to improve the situation (even without formal authority):\n\n* Establish or propose working agreements with product owners (intake rules, prioritization cadence, definition of “expedite”).\n* Make capacity and trade-offs visible (e.g., “If we do X this week, Y moves out”).\n* Encourage regular alignment rituals (refinement, planning, retrospectives) that focus on how you work together, not just delivery.\n* If possible, escalate the conversation from “this task is hard” to “this way of working is creating delivery risk and burnout.”\n\nSo yes, PMs experience this a lot, especially early in Agile transformations or in weak matrix organizations. The situation is stressful, but it’s not a personal failure on your part. It’s a system problem. And while you may not be able to fix it alone, naming the patterns and pushing for clearer agreements is often the first meaningful step.\n\nRegards.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I am brand new to the world of PM. I have no formal PM training but have done some of it informally with various work-related/extracurricular stuff in my life.\n\nI am currently in the position of \"organizational consultant\" to my family's garment factory. I have been exploring various tools such as Slack, Asana, etc. We all use Whatsapp groups right now—an obvious nightmare lol. However, there are some limitations to my use case: **Most of the employees don't speak English** or any other supported language, so getting all the people who, in a tech-savvier, English-speaking company, would be on the app, is not possible. For example, I cannot get department heads on the app. \n\nAlso, while I would like to get more sign offs, timelines, that kind of thing in front of employees, these apps seem to have too many bells and whistles. **Many of our employees are not particularly tech savvy** and getting them to use a Silicon Valley-built app with all its features would be tough. Right now the factory does a LOT of work on paper. The only people with a computer are the manager, the admin assistants, and the white collar dept (accounting, graphic design). Everyone directly involved in production solely uses paper printouts and Whatsapp. So documents and other visual aids are naturally kept simpler to parse.\n\n**What I *think* would be ideal is an app that needs to be used only by the manager and admin assistant**, as those are the tech savviest people I have the most communication with. I am already doing some spreadsheet training with them (this is the level we're at, they're smart but the knowledge just isn't there!) so I could train them to use the app to create checklists, Gantt charts, and other aids for the various departments. \n\n**Basically: I want the department heads to be able to sign off on things, consult checklists, view timelines, etc. but I want the manager/admin assistant to be the one to make and deliver print outs.** I hope that makes sense, I understand this situation is quite different from the average U.S. office.\n\nI am also very open to any other thoughts you may have on my situation, outside of apps. Like I said I am new to the world of PM and I am sure I have much to learn. Our company has been hit hard by tariffs and we are trying to keep things afloat so everyone can keep food on the table in 2026. I am very grateful for any advice you can provide.",

If you don't follow the above process you run a very high risk of ending up with a white elephant because staff will not see the benefit or it improving their day to day working life and find work arounds or not even use the system at all. Then that falls on to you because you spent a large amount of company money on something that doesn't work. \n\nYou need to shift your perspective, an application doesn't fix the problem unless you know what is actually wrong and that is by understanding what the technical and user requirements are and how they're used in a business workflow. You also need to explain to the executive, if they cut corners and not invest in understanding the problems, you will fail as a company, waste money and put the business at risk. \n\nAlso the attitude of \"I want, I think\" is not a position of strength, you need to show your executive on why a system is needed, with justification and choices. You need to show the benefit (s) of what you're proposing because there would be a significant investment required. Also something of a reflection point, if you don't understand the problem you run the very real risk of being \"that person\" who screwed up. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

The tricky bit tends to be \"what level to break them down into\".   I tend to use the resources needed to identify the break down, ie when a different resource set is needed split that tasks out. The simple example is \"produce spec\" could be one line but if you consider the resources involved we have the author, review group and sign off authority, this leaves a logical split of draft, review, amend, signoff.  In this way your plan tells the story of how the spec is produced, becomes faster to update and more accurate. \n\nLinking the tasks is vital. If you then set deadlines in the end you can see the slack in the schedule as others have said and use that to see if a bit of slippage can be accommodated or if you have to take action to pull it back.\n\nOf all the tools out there only ms project and P6 seem to handle linking tasks well, the rest seem to be card based collaboration and task tracking tools with done scheduling tracked on. However my experience is heavily MSP based so I'm open to learning this is no longer the case :)",

I have a list of business requirements that need to be divided between the POS vendor and the Loyalty vendor. I'm scheduling a meeting to review with the vendors and trying to figure out how to approach the meeting. Is it just going through the system diagram that our architect created and then stepping through the requirements? From there the vendors will write their separate requirements for their parts? I'll leave it at that for now.\n\nFor my background - 20+ years as a technical project manager. Here, I'm usually dedicated to the eComm team where I function as PM, SME, solution design, testing, whatever - very hands on. With this project, I'm a little more boxed in; in the past, I've been told not to try to provide solutions, but only requirements and let the vendors provide solutions - so I'm sitting on my hands here. Normally, I would divide the requirements between each vendor. Maybe I'm overcomplicating because it's not a scenario I'm familiar with.\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much for the help! I created a spreadsheet (with change tracking) with columns for each vendor. Adding this agenda\n\n1. Review architecture diagram\n\n2. Step through requirements, identifying ownership for each\n\na. Discussion of risks, issues, constraints\n\n3. Next steps",

          "text": "For this kind of setup, the biggest risk isn’t which roles you hire, but missing ownership at the right time. You need clarity on three things from day one:\n\n1. Who has decision authority (not just who writes requirements)\n2. Who owns the technical solution during the vendor build, not after\n3. Who owns operations and handover end-to-end\n\nIn practice, with a small team, that usually means:\n\n* A real Product Owner (not just a domain expert/BA) who owns priorities and hard trade-offs\n* A senior engineer / architect embedded with the vendor, owning architecture, NFRs, and code quality\n* Engineers + QA involved early to build system knowledge before the vendor exits\n* DevOps and design can stay lightweight early and be handled part-time.\n\nFrom my experience in outsourcing (I work for the EU-based outsourcing company): vendor lock-in rarely comes from contracts or tech choices, it usually comes from knowledge distribution and gaps. The acquiring team must understand the system before the vendor leaves, not during “handover”. A successful handover is not something you do at the end, it’s something you should (ideally) practice throughout the delivery. Hope this helps!",

As long as you sell it as a SaaS (Almost all are now anyway) you could get much stronger product on a much smaller budget. You just build your customized module and sell it as \"OP's CRM\" - Powered by XYZ and can roll something out in a month. Plus your client will trust you more selling a fork of a major product than some basement level 6 man CRM.\n\nYour vendor lock in problem just disappeared because you have many developers that work with that architecture for your custom module.",

Our infrastructure team is constantly changing our broader tech stack, so I need something the PMO can control and maintain independently.\n\nKey points:\n\t•\tPortfolio-level visibility only like projects, status, high-level milestones, project RAG. \n\t•\tNot looking for a full PPM solution until we have a stable tech environment \n\t•\tMinimal setup and admin overhead hopefully free as I need minimal features right now  \n\nThis is essentially a stopgap until our tech infrastructure stabilizes and can properly support integrations\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?\nWhat lightweight tools or approaches worked for you during a transition period?",
