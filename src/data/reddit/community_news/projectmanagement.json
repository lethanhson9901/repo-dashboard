The director has changed and so have some of the leadership throughout the last year or so as well as some have been let go. With all of the changes and I only having a last few weeks at this company, it is a little bit weird to be part of conversations on meetings where I am the subject matter expert and almost like transferring the knowledge over as I have been working on it the last few years. It almost feels like a grieving process as well as a bit awkward because your role in job is ending, but it almost feels like no one talks about it.",

The best advice I can offer is to build strong relationships with recruiters. My last five roles have come directly from those connections.

Typically, my project was Project (Server/Online) and working to improve the use of Project by the client’s PM team, or implementation of Project Server/Online. \n\nMy last contract role was with a large insurance company. I had done the implementation and was training and mentoring the users based on their process. They got a new PMO leader who called me in and said “I am not sure I see the value in this” and I replied “Because you are not using it right.” \n\nShe rightfully challenged with “Isn’t that your job?” And of course it was, but when gathering requirements, I am told to go in one direction or another and even if I say ‘that’s not best practice’ or ‘you won’t get full benefit from the tool’ in the end I do it the way they say to. \n\nSo we reconfigured and I did some more training and it was better. Then I was invited to go to a big conference in Idaho and present and my contract was extended 90 days and I was asked if I would consider a full time role. \n\nAt the end of 90 days nothing happened and the manager I reported to told me he didn’t think they were going to extend again. \n\nLiterally while having that discussion I saw a call coming in. I let it roll to VM. \n\nLater I listened to the message and called the guy back. He was a recruiter for Microsoft. The first question I asked was “Is this an orange badge (contract) or blue badge (FTE) position.” \n\nIt was an FTE position and I went through most of the Microsoft 5 step process and started. After about 15 years of working for Microsoft Gold Partners, working for the mothership was a big step up.",

Forty projects means forty sets of unresolved decisions, risks, and future obligations sitting in the background all the time — even when you feel mentally fine. Your brain never really powers down.\n\nThat’s why it shows up physically and disappears on vacation. Nothing is waiting on you there.\n\nA lot of Project Managers normalise this without realising it. You don’t feel anxious or panicked, but your body is still running constant threat detection because so much is unresolved or dependent on you.\n\nWhat actually helps isn’t stress techniques. It’s reducing how much uncertainty you hold as PM. Being clearer about what you own, what you escalate, and forcing decisions so things stop sitting in limbo.\n\nPM stress usually isn’t about hours. It’s about being the place unresolved decisions go to live. Your body notices even if you’ve learned to ignore it.",

I (mostly) adhered to HR’s “coordination only” mandate but considered the fact that at some point I’d have to take PTO and no one knew how to do anything I did. (Previously, my PTO required a week of preparation and the expectation that certain things just wouldn’t get started or done during that period.)\n\nAt my annual review three months later, I received high remarks, commending my leadership skills. I was feeling appreciated and accomplished now that I finally had support. \n\nTwo weeks after that, I was laid off in a RIF. \n\nThe CMO who months earlier had fought to get me help is rumored to be the person who identified me as redundant. He subsequently admitted to one of my former coworkers that he didn’t know or understand what project managers even do, despite the fact I had monthly meetings with him. \n\nI thankfully landed on my feet fairly quickly with a new company and I have an amazing boss who routinely tells me to stop taking on so much. I thank my lucky stars every day. \n\nBut my gawd, the PTSD I still internally battle. I have such a fear of speaking up when I’m at capacity now because I spent years physically making myself ill while managing an unmanageable, unsustainable amount of work and I never expected that I would be so easily discarded by someone who didn’t understand or value everything I did for our team!",

If one constraint of time, cost or scope changes then the other two must change.\n\nAll you need to say to the client is that \"I'm happy to help with this scope change and the impact of this change will see your project take longer to deliver and it will cost more\".  It pushes back on to the client to see how serious they are about the change as It becomes a litmus to test to see if the client balks at the fact it's going to take longer and cost more.  When the client tries to vary the conversation around any type of change just refer back to the triple constraint because it's a causal effect model. You also have to have a frank conversation about the project's project plan and especially if it's an approved and has been baselined and if in the current situation it's effectively allowing scope creep to occur and contractually the client is exceeding the agreed scope of the contract which raises another whole ball game of conversation around what is legally binding for those variations from everything from support, design, licensing etc. But also how it impacts your organisation's ability to service other clients because the workforce planning model is constantly changing (but that is your executive's problem but it's something that should be in the back of your mind with situations like this.\n\nYou need to seriously consider escalating internally with your project manager and project board or executive about the scope creep problem because it has contractual and legal obligations but it's also heightens your organisation's reputational risk. Then if your executive choose to allow the client's behaviour go unchecked (their choice) then you need to ask for administration support or you will run the risk of burnout. Again highlight the risk and impact of choice!\n\nThis is about you understanding that you need to be having professional and sometimes difficult conversations about fact and impact of choices and the associated risks. Without putting too much of a spin on this you need to put yourself in a proactive position rather than being passive because your fear is leading you where it shouldn't, you need the confidence to point out the facts and it's why we have a project plan, it's a legally binding plan and contract of who, what, when and how and all you're doing is enforcing that plan. The only last thought around this is that your client also knows you're a soft touch and you're actually being bullied or rough ridden into scope creep without you even realizing it, just some reflection points for your consideration and good luck, I hope it works out for you.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

Think of it like revisions or releases. \n\nOne method is to have your leadership team agree to your method, before approaching your client with this.  Then take your client and indicate that you will package up their requests, and for X period of time, you will work on these. Complete them, and then have another session with them, gather more of their next batch of requests, and then complete those.  That will allow you to manage your workload (work/life balance), and provide a consistent and quality output.  \n\nAlso if you think the scope is being exceeded, then you need to refer back to the original Statement of Work, or Signed off requirements to identify such.  Again, have the conversation with your leadership team about this.  Giving away free work sets a bad precedent.  Moving forward, that client and potentially other clients will know that they can push the bounds of any signed/agreed requirements and start asking for the moon.  \n\nThis becomes less about you 'handling' it, and more about putting a process in place and following the rigor of that process.

They’ll even sit passively in meetings while you - the PM - misguidedly take responsibility for confirming technical readiness to launch. \n\nIf have learned - brutally and frighteningly - that technical teams will change from “Super confident, infallible masters of the universe” to “Vague, uncertain, evasive put-upon victims” the minute things start to go wrong post-launch. If you haven’t nailed those fuckers to the wall in front of your project sponsor and made sure they say - in writing - that they approve a launch, they will - sure as shit - blame the ***cruel, unreasonable*** PM for pushing to launch something that they valiantly tried to say wasn’t ready (then weep softly into their handkerchief).  \n\nThe reason I say this is an unpopular opinion is that it undermines every basic assumption of all PM concepts - that delivery teams and the idea of the Senior Supplier own the technical solution. \n\nI’ve experienced it so many times that I will simply refuse to accept a launch unless the exec/direcor responsible for a technical product has written that they accept responsibility for the launch - and that I have their personal mobile number when their team members don’t answer their phones when the network warnings start lighting up 5 minutes post launch.",

Agile for design but with waterfall-like documentation and focus on interdependent deliverables. Then agile for test and acceptance prior to deployment.

I haven’t got time for these stupid steerco meetings that apparently I’m meant to chair. How was I meant to know anything was wrong?”* etc etc\n\n- Flattering the egos of recalcitrant techs who view themselves as the only correct person on earth and that they alone hold the keys to project success - until a service launch goes wrong when they suddenly become a put-upon confused victim who was ***forced*** to launch by the EVIL PM when they didn’t understand the systems, tech etc etc etc\n\n- Holding your position in front of perpetually-furious junior operational managers who cannot understand or accept why ***your*** project insists that ***their*** processes or systems have to change - why does the cruel PM want to change everything?

Just breathe 2. Remember no one is going to die in a ditch over a project (unless it's you putting them in one) 3. Go back to project management 101 principles of time, cost and scope. \n\nGo back and ensure the business case is fit for purpose, if you don't have a proper business case then ensure one is developed but here is the key ensure your executive has approved it. Saying \"we want to upgrade\" is not a business case, a business case is required to ensure they understand the business value and describing its purpose of implementing and how the project will generate it's value. \n\nThen start with your technical requirements, user requirements and business workflows (conduct your 1:1 meetings, workshops, requirement gathering work groups etc.) and map those to a design and the key here again, have the executive sign and approve the requirements.  Focus on roles and responsibilities along with accountability, if the organisation can't provide the information you need then your project board or executive carry the risk of not reaching benefits realisation and end up in project failure.  Not being a PM, you need to follow this principle workflow because if you don't you're being set up to fail but as the \"responsible person\" it's the path that you need to take to avoid a shit show and get out of the quicksand requirements. Hold people accountable or push back, those are the choices you have and if you don't you will be held as the scapegoat at the end of a failed project. \n\nHere is the reality, if you can't get the requirements and design approved then you need to keep on pushing out the end date of delivery, or you place the risk at the feet of your executive to except. You as the default PM need to provide the clarity needed in order to make the decisions needed and the only way you can do that is develop the design and requirements mapping as your primary focus because you need a clear plan and have it approved. Good luck \n\nJust an armchair perspective \n\n",

They did the big transition from Lotus Notes + a hodge podge of applications a few years ago. \n\nA good friend of mine is fairly senior at E&Y and said it was fairly smooth behind the scenes. I worked for Microsoft at the time and was reading internal reports about the project. \n\nI looked up a couple of things that might help. \n\nAlso, and I can’t stress this enough: get an Adoption and Change Management (ACM) person involved **now.** Some people are very attached to Notes and have performed unsupported customizations that give them their data in specific ways. Give the users a voice or the project will not be successful. \n\nThere are tools that will make it much easier. Transfer the risk to the tools (and consultants). Way back when, working for a Microsoft partner, we had a client who decided they could do the migration on their own through some scripting and manual effort. And….boom, Notes crashed with huge data loss because they hadn’t planned on customizations that people had done with Notes. We were able to recover the data from a backup and did the rest work after attending a farewell party for the CIO. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/gasearch?q=ernst%26yoing%20migration%20from%20lotus%20notes%20to%20microsoft%20365&source=sh/x/gs/m2/5#lfId=ChxjMe\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mailbox-migration/migrate-from-lotus-notes\n\nHope this helped.",

It sounds like an unbounded decision problem disguised as a migration.\n\nWhat you are describing is what happens when sequencing is never agreed on. Everything becomes critical, everything feels coupled, and the role quietly turns into absorbing organizational anxiety instead of moving work forward.\n\nFrom the outside, your instinct to migrate mail first and defer the rest is not reckless. It is one of the few moves that actually creates a stable surface to stand on. The paralysis you are feeling is what happens when leadership wants certainty about risks that cannot be fully known until something exists.\n\nThe tension with security and collaboration is also familiar. Executives often ask for “maximum collaboration” and “maximum protection” as if they are independent knobs. They are not. Someone has to name the tradeoffs, or the work never converges.\n\nWhat usually helps in situations like this is not another technical plan, but a reset of expectations. A clear articulation of phases, what questions can only be answered later, and what decisions are intentionally deferred. Without that, every new initiative will keep reentering the conversation and reshaping the scope.\n\nYou are not wrong to feel frustrated. You are being asked to build forward while the target keeps moving. That is not a failure of execution. It is a failure of alignment.",

We need something that will help us not lose track of deadlines and projects and let us focus!\"\n\nWhat I got was \"we don't want to use that software. Don't send new emails, only reply to emails. Don't tell us about new processes, you can only suggest them and then we will decide. Also, here is an extremely detailed email of all the things I want you to type into this document that we all have access to.\"\n\nI went into for projects, and I got operations.\n\nSo, I am looking for a new job, but this basically derailed my learning, my career trajectory, and my personal life for the past year. The worst part is that when I was tapped for projects outside of my department, I am praised as a savior, saint, guru, etc (a little hyperbolic but just to prove the point.) Inside my department, I can't even present information with a full thought before being interrupted, questioned, and dismissed.\n\nAnd yesterday, my title was changed from Project Manager to Projects Coordinator, which I actually agree with in terms of what they want for the role, but it's not what I was hired to do.\n\nHow on earth do I a) grow from this and b) get out and into something new without saying \"it was an absolute shit show.\"",

The reason for the change is to grow as a project practitioner because project management is a very broad discipline and there is just not one way to deliver a project and the only way you get experience is by changing your roles in order to develop your delivery style. The thing you need to consider is that you need to change about every two years because after that it's hard to implement change but you're also pickup bad organisational behaviour as well. \n\nI would also suggest joining a professional membership such as Prince2 or PMI in your local chapter, as it will give you access to resources and potential opportunities. I would also suggest doing a goals plan for the next 1,3 & 5 years as that becomes your roadmap on what you need to do in order to achieve your goals. Seek out a mentors as well, not just in project management but also someone from the executive to help build your business acumen (business savvy). \n\nIt took me a long time to get to this understanding, at the end of the day all employers are the same and will always look out from themselves and not consider your career, what it all really comes down to is what are you willing to put up with. Just a reflection point for your consideration, you need to not focus on your title because the term and definition changes at every organisation, you're a project practitioner regardless of your title. \n\nJust an armchair perspective ",

I dont have much experience dealing with c suite but it feels like they speak a different language. Stuff they say goes over my head and having a hard time to connect the dots. I would like to have an engaging dialogue but I feel like Im behind or lacking when it comes to \"strategy\" conversations. Also Im afraid of asking so many questions since it will make me look inexperienced or not ready for this project.\n\nWhat are some tips to start thinking and being able to converse intelligently with my executive sponsor.

          "text": "4 tips:\n\n1. Understand what you want from the conversation / presentation.  Approval to do something?  Decision on something?  Inform them on something?  Showcase your own success?  Frame the conversation / presentation to achieve that objective - if you need a decision, get to that point quite early.\n\n2. Conclusion first, explanation after.  Tell them the conclusion first - they may not have time or attention to hear your lengthy argument and logic.  They can assign someone else to check your work later, or just trust you.  The worst situation is when you carefully explain your logic and argument, then the audience unexpectedly has to cut the meeting short and walk out before you got to your conclusion (or someone talks too much and drags it out, and you run out of time before the conclusion).\n\n3. Focus on the positives.  A C-level told me to my face: \"We spend all day listening to problems, I don't want to hear every problem you have as well.\"  So, focus on your positives and successes.  Construct it as a shit sandwich - good news first, put the bad news in the middle, then end with more good news.  Don't hide the bad news, risks, issues, but don't make that the focus of your presentation.\n\nLooping back to the first point, consider what you want to achieve with presenting the bad news - just informing them, covering your ass, asking for approval to do something, asking for decision to do something.  If it's just informing them, keep it crisp and clear and don't let it take too much time.\n\n4. Execs like to show their success to others.  Create your presentation in a way that Execs can forward to others showcasing success, even if it is a shit sandwich.  Add some context in appendix for outsiders to better understand the project.  Place your name prominently on the first slide.  When your Exec forwards your presentation to other execs, in order to showcase \"his\" success in \"his\" project, some of the glory also drips down on you.",

There is nothing wrong in asking questions, what is wrong is when you don't and it bites you in the behind, that is when you do look inexperienced and as they say there are no stupid questions!  This is purely a confidence thing and a good project practitioner pushes through their comfort zone in order to successfully deliver their projects.\n\nI would also suggest seeking out two mentors firstly a senior project or program manager (and not your immediate manager) and the other is seeking out an executive to help you develop your business acumen (business savvy).\n\nWhen communicating with the c-suite, it needs to be short, concise and to the point and ensure that you communicate in what you need from them. Bullet points is your friend but think in terms of current problem, impact and what do you need from them, simple.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

You are not responsible for communicating the details of the weeds to them.  That probably should go with your immediate supervisor.  Again, keep it simple.\n\nWhen I present project status to the execs, I make it monkey proof.  I have the main project drivers lit up in three colors.  Green equals its on track.  Yellow means I have concerns, but no issues yet.  Red means we have serious problems and the sky is falling.

Management is for processes like assembly lines. Leadership is something entirely different.\n\nTo solve this, look for a vision which leads people to use the best tools. Going all gantt horny and \"Herding Cats\" is only asking for endless frustration and failure; for everyone.\n\nYour goal is to get everyone wanting the same clear thing. The executive, the clients, the executive. This way, all conversations can be filtered through this vision. They can ask for changes, etc, and you can say, \"Great idea. I am going to put that into Phase II\"\n\nWhen they asked for it to be in Phase I, I would ask what in Phase I should be moved to Phase II? When they would say, \"Can't you do it all in Phase I? I would ask how much we can now delay Phase I, but their brilliant idea would work very well in Phase II.\n\nThe key is to manage their expectation as to what is going to be done in Phase I.\n\nThen, when Phase II was being planned, they usually had forgotten their stupid idea; or the other people would disagree that it should be done at all. This way, you also avoided a pile of stupid meetings discussing stupid ideas.\n\nThe key here was the project was a creative process and thus leadership is the only way to run this. But, clients are more like a factory. They require a process, and that is something you manage.\n\nThere is no reason for clients to be in Jira outside of reporting bugs. They should have their expectations managed by regular reporting of the progress through reports. If they are pumping new features or alterations through slack on an endless basis, the math will kill you. Any collection of dumbasses given this sort of method for adding or changing features will be able to make demands which far exceed your speed of delivering. \"Hey could you port it to Apple?\" \"Oh, wait, we would like it on my Apple watch as well\". This means that they have not bought into a clear vision of what is going to be built, or when, or how constrained the resources are to do this.\n\nA proper iterative development methodology will definitely have feedback, but controlled by a good leader to more be a refinement of the vision, vs a bunch of micro directives.",

You as the PM need to set clear expectations of what is required and expected and if you can't get the outputs you need then you have to flag and escalate to your project board/sponsor/executive because not only do you have a IT system and data stores issue (e.g. not fit for purpose) you also have an organisational culture issues compounding the situation.  I also feel that you're being taken advantage and rough ridden with stakeholder non compliance, that is something that needs to be escalated. \n\nTask progress and tracking is your responsibility as the PM and you need to make a single system work, you need to work the stakeholders, their team leads and executive to reach a suitable and attainable outcome.  As an extreme example (and yes it did actually happen) I once had a Dev team who was extremely non compliant (apparently the company revolved around them), After basically refusing to comply with the project reporting requirements I had a project status meeting and clearly outlined how their behaviour impact me to deliver the project but how it raises the organisation's risk profile and then I reiterated my position on expectations and requirements. I also highlighted their behaviour as being unprofessional and outside project and organisational governance models, so repeated non behaviour can and will require HR involvement. \n\nAfter further non compliance I started having ad-hoc and inconvenient mandatory meetings e.g 08:00am, 12:00pm or 5:00pm. Did all hell break loose? Yes and the management team were standing behind me on this one. Did I make friends? No. Did I get what I needed? Yes. Did they comply in the future? Yes.  As a PM you will learn as you become more seasoned is that you can't be everything to everyone, because you need something from them in order to deliver. your project on time, on budget and fit for purpose,  ultimately you need to hold these people accountable. If they're required to use a system or systems (s) to track efforts then that is what is required, and I will ask you this, why do you get to carry the can when it fails and your stakeholders are not doing what is expected or required of them?

I am an individual with AuDHD who has gotten through life by basically never having a plan of any sort. Every time I've tried to plan something it has gone horribly. Whether its an event or something else. The honest answer is that I avoid it because I feel pretty much incompetant at it every time. Throughout my whole life, whenever I tried to do a thing that wasn't pretty much laid out or obvious, I'd crash almost immediately into a wall of anxiety.\n\nNever planning or really managing my time got me through uni and the first few years of work as a software dev. Now I'm being asked to do bigger, ambiguous projects as the lead... and I'm utterly lost. I have no intuition for any of it. I can't plan anything out, or when I do manage to get something down I can't connect on how to actually execute it. I certainly never, ever feel any sort of confidence in it.\n\nI'm newly medicated, which honestly is how I'm making this post I think, but I think I recognize a fundamental and deep skills gap that I never developed as an individual in or adjacent to project management. I want to develop this skill, in fact its been a top goal of mine for a damn long time. I've tried a lot of different things and methods, none of which involve just buying or doing a course. I'm looking now at the google project management course, but the very first video in the course babbles on about how he has a very natural inclination to project management, which seems to be the antithesis of what I want. I want something that makes no assumptions about my ability to plan and assumes I'm a new born baby.\n\nSo I'm here looking for advice. I don't want to be a project manager as a profession, but I want the ability to manage projects whether that be for work, my own projects, events, whatever else. How can I learn this skill?",

Like you can keep it all in your head (behind everything) and still steer things in a direction.\n\nNext, project management,as much as scary it might sound to you, is actually something everyone does in their lives, you want to go to the movies? You plan, coordinate, take actions and boom you and your friends are in different building with popcorn in your hands and watching a movie. That took deliberate planning and coordination.\n\nNow scale that down and you get basic stuff like doing laundry, keeping your house clean and cooking.\n\nScale it up and add hundreds of people with suits and jumpers with a lot writeups and meetings - you get an enterprise software development project.\n\nAt the end of the day, project management is about breaking down a single goal into multiple taskable steps within a constrained budget(days & dollars).\n\nI believe any intelligent person is capable of thriving in this role. \n\nWith the way you have written down and articulated yourself , its clear that you are an intelligent person as well.\n\nSo jump right into, youll be able to manage it.\n\n\nNote : A senior project manager (20 years) told me that our role is not project management but Expectation Management.

The skill was never taught in a way that works for you.\n\nTry reframing it as planning is not a personality trait. It is an external system. Some of us internalize it early, and some of us never get shown how.\n\nStop trying to plan the whole thing. Your only job is to identify the next smallest step that reduces uncertainty. Planning is translation, not prediction. You are turning confusion into visible pieces not forecasting the future. write plans as questions instead of tasks. What do we need to know next? is often enough to move forward. Can’t stress this enough externalize everything. If it stays in your head, anxiety wins. Messy notes are fine as long as you can read them or make sense if it. 😂 Execution comes from structure not confidence. Time boxes and checklists matter more than feeling ready.\n\nThat I’m naturally good at PM content is crap. Look for tools that help you break ambiguity down, even if they feel basic or boring.

          "text": "This might sounds super basic so I hope this doesn’t come off as insulting, but here is my advice:\n\nStart with a list. Write down everything that you know needs to happen for the project. Then order the list (what happens first, what will happen last, is there something that needs to happen before something else, and so on and so forth). For example to feed your dog: you need to feed the dog, make sure you have dog food, determine how much dog food you need to feed, but you can’t do the tasks in that order. You can’t feed the dog before you have dog food. \n\nOnce you have your list, figure out how long the tasks will take or how long you think they will take. Then figure out who will be responsible for doing the work. If you don’t know right away, that’s okay, but then you’ll need to go and figure it out either by doing some research or asking colleagues. \n\nYou’ll want to schedule meetings with the people involved so you can get their input, make sure they know what their responsibilities are, and share deadlines. Then as time goes on you’ll have more meetings (or conversations) with them to make sure they are doing their tasks and hitting deadlines. \n\nDepending on your organization, you might hear terms like waterfall, agile, standups, sprints. Those all refer to different project management methodologies and tools. You might want to talk to your boss and ask about your organization’s existing processes and talk to colleagues about what has worked for them. \n\nIf you are interested in a crash course, I’d recommend Google’s project management course. It’s not super helpful if you are trying to become a certified PM, but if you’re a newbie just looking to build skills, it’s very approachable and has hands on activities which is helpful if you learn by doing. \n\nGood luck!",

Understanding the project process and methodologies will help in contributing more effectively. \n\nGoogle Project Management is an easy, entry-level FREE course that gives a good overview of how projects work. For more deep-dive, the CAPM is a good option.\n\nMaybe take a step back and consider whether you really want to manage people, organise tasks for the team, frequently chair meetings where you request everyone's progress against the plan, their impediment for progress etc. I believe you need to be organised with attention to detail to do this, you need to communicate a lot with people, you need to constantly uncover misunderstandings and facilitate alignment.\n\nA lot of my time goes to \"he said so, but she said something else\", then bring them (reluctantly) together and come to an agreement.\n\nIf you really want to do this, I suggest you work on your soft skills as much as your technical PM skills.",

What is absolutely critical vs like, what’s just nice to have.\n\n100% to what someone else said about externalizing everything and writing everything down. I still have to remind myself to write shit down because if I don’t, there’s a 50/50 chance I forget about it as soon as my brain moves on to something else. \n\nWhen it comes to practicing, don’t be too hard on yourself. Start with a brainstorming session. I like to use post its because you don’t need to commit to any order cause you can just move things around (and it takes some of the pressure off for needing to feel like I’m writing the correct things down in the right order). Keep asking “what do I need to do that.” “Ask an expert/chatgpt/research” is a perfectly fine answer to that question, also. Another thing I’ve found super helpful is being VERY liberal with reminders and alarms. Alexa and I are bffs. Cause like sure I can plan stuff, but remembering to do the things I planned? Yeaaaahhh. I schedule blocks in my calendar sometimes for a specific task so that I offload having to remember to do something to the computer. \n\nBut also the thing with plans is like… they very rarely go perfectly, at least in my experience. Having a flexible mindset and somewhat-flexible contingencies is helpful esp if the project isn’t crazy high stakes. Nobody is going to die and things are not on literal fire? Cool cool. \n\nLinked in learning had had some decent trainings if you have access to that. \n\nSome other practice questions to help hone your skills - you say that every time you’ve tried to plan something, it’s gone horribly. Without blaming yourself - what happened and what kinds of things can you do, or questions you can ask to reduce the odds or impact of it happening again? Like, if your vacation plans were ruined because you showed up and there were no tickets day of, what are things you can do next time ahead of time to avoid this outcome? And if you can’t think of anything, get a boost from chatgpt but don’t let it do all the thinking for you. \n\nOh, and everything always takes longer and is more expensive than you expect, so add in some buffer space.",

As part of that process, we looked at platforms like Monday.com and Asana alongside more traditional PPM solutions. Our conclusion was that these tools felt like overkill for enterprise-level PPM, strong at task and team-level execution, but less compelling when evaluated through an enterprise portfolio lens relative to cost.\n\nThat said, the hype and adoption are hard to ignore, which makes me think there are workflows or contexts where the value is much clearer than what we observed.\n\nFor those who actively use one of these platforms:\n\n\t•\tWhat specific workflows or operating models make the price worth it?\n\n\t•\tAt what team size or organizational maturity does the ROI become clear?\n\n\t•\tAre you using advanced automation, cross-team dependencies, portfolio views, or integrations in ways that materially improve outcomes?\n\n\t•\tWhere do these tools shine and where do they start to feel like overkill or underutilized?\n\nI’m not trying to knock either platform. I’m genuinely interested in understanding where they fit best, and what types of organizations or workflows get the most value relative to the cost.\n\nWould appreciate real-world perspectives, especially from PMs, ops leaders, or portfolio leaders who’ve evaluated or lived with these tools long enough to see both the benefits and the tradeoffs.",

Planner has a built in portfolio function that you can just  use instead of buckets. Plus, if you use the portfolio version instead of buckets, you can templatize similar projects, and use the buckets for a different purpose. \n\nI like your teams setup, and I do the same for the large program I'm running. However, I think it will all depend on buy in from sales in using it. My teams site struggles with adoption because people just message me or other teammates instead of using the channel. I will be stealing your power automate ideas though :). \n\nAnother idea if you have good traction with this setup, set up a SharePoint site with a quick overview of knowledge, key files, and even a high level critical path view of the higher profile projects for non-core team members",

          "text": "Where I’ve seen things like this start to hurt isn’t Planner itself — it’s when projects begin to compete with each other in real ways. While you’re under \\~10 projects and priorities mostly align, one plan works fine. The moment two projects both “need to move” and share the same people, the system will show you the problem but won’t help you resolve it. You’ll feel that gap pretty quickly.\n\nAnother thing to watch is labels. “Blocked externally” is great in theory, but over time people get softer with it. Things quietly shift to “in progress” because no one wants their project to look stuck. Automation then just reports whatever it’s given. That’s not a tooling flaw — it’s just human behaviour once visibility exists.\n\nSame with the automations. They’re useful at first, then they fade into background noise. Once that happens, you’re back to status theatre, just without the manual work. The difference-maker is whether there’s a clear moment where “still blocked” stops being information and turns into a conversation with someone senior.\n\nThe parts I like are the obvious ones: delivery owning structure, sales not being dragged into tools, and BI sitting above it all instead of adding more noise. That’s sensible.\n\nIf this setup struggles later, it won’t be because Planner can’t scale. It’ll be because you’ve solved visibility but not yet solved how decisions get forced when projects clash. Most portfolio setups die right there.\n\nOverall, you’re on the right track — just don’t let it become a very efficient way of reporting problems without actually resolving them.",

      "text": "I passed the CPMAI exam. Here is my experience.\n\nBackground: I got my PMP about 6 months ago. My role in consulting is very delivery focused and I was looking for a solid framework. PMP was the right move. With the focus on AI projects, I wanted a framework or methodology that I can use for AI projects and also just to learn more about AI, so I decided to go for the CPMAI.\n\nStudy: \n\n1. Main course: I signed up for the course on the PMI website and went through the course once. It's all just text with not videos/audio which is honestly not my preferred way of learning. \n\n2. Practice exam: After going through the course once, I signed up for the practice exam on the PMI website. The exam was way easier than all the PMP prep exam I went through. Even on my first attempt, I scored 85%. Went through it a few more times over the course of 2 weeks and got up to 95%. The multiple choice questions are usually the ones where I didn't get all answer right.\n\n3. Additional learning: I threw all the material into NotebookLM, created podcasts per module and quizzes too. Went through that for about a week including some chat conversations to clarify.\n\nExam:\n\nTook the exam at home. 120 questions. Some odd questions that were more basic PMP questions. Overall a lot more difficult than the practice exam on the PMI website but still easier than the PMP. All scenario based questions, usually just multiple choice with a few questions where I had to select more than one answer. I got through all the 120 questions in about 90 minutes, no break.\n\nHonestly, sitting focused for 90 minutes without break is tough. I found myself reading the same question repeatedly because I just didn't \"get\" the information I was reading. At the end of the exam I got the notification that I passed. Took about one day before I got the official notification via PMI via email.\n\n  \nAll together, compared to the PMP, I'd say the CPMAI is overpriced. The learning itself is still valuable and I would recommend it for anyone who works on AI projects.",

My goal is to work in construction management eventually. \n\nI love being a student and studying so I don't mind the workload at all, but I realize that I'm at a little disadvantage compared to my peers due to the lack of professional experience (not that it deters me!) I'm doing a ton of reading articles, research papers, watching videos, but I'm wondering what else I can do to gain a practical understanding that comes from actual experience. \n\nI would appreciate any advice you can share, I'm practically a sponge right now trying to absorb any knowledge, advice, or suggestion that comes my way.

      "text": "I switched from my role in communications with a broad team to being a PM with a smaller team because I absolutely loved the people and their mission. Plus, my communications team had become quite toxic, and I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nThis is my first time as an official PM. I was put in charge of business operations/admin projects. It's hard because so many examples in trainings are focused on technical projects. And most of what I do feels like I'm not even the administrative assistant or office administrator, I just write down what those people do and mark it done at our weekly meetings. I'm so mind-numbingly bored.\n\nI also manage some \"projects\" like hiring staff. So, I write down the job title we're hiring for and have Asana automated to fill in all the subtasks that get a person hired. Most of these tasks require waiting on HR or procurement teams with whom I have no communication, so we have a weekly meeting with leadership where they tell me the status of the roles we're hiring for. They hardly ever come. And recently, we've been on a hiring freeze requiring leadership to write justifications for their positions, so that call had become more about tracking those justifications, something I'm also not in direct communication with those above us about and need people to tell me what happened, so I can merely mark it off in Asana, a spreadsheet now, and a PPT that our director wanted for tracking for some reason. Recently? I was given the feedback that leadership doesn't feel like the hiring calls are helpful or productive or something, and the only advice I was given from our program manager is that they need to know the impact of how long the hiring process is taking on their projects. He was pointing at the dates in Asana. So, I just said, \"So, they just want me to read the due dates? Okay.\" My response was a little clipped. I kept having to swallow my frustration and try not to appear like I had a bad attitude, but I know it probably came through. \n\nMy boss then told me he wanted me to watch trainings on Udemy on project management. I told him I would but those usually give the examples of technical projects and mine feel more non-traditional (his words in the past). I understand what project management should be. This just feels like it isn't it. What can I do or say to make this better? Is this a normal situation for a PM? I only want to keep my job because it pays my rent and jobs are hard to come by, but I don't know if I can handle how pointless I feel much longer. Thanks for any advice.",

Daily, twice a week, whatever makes sense for the volume of work. Proactively gather their updates and build a relationship with that team.\n\nTry to streamline and increase visibility into the process - see if you can bring the HR team over to Asana for this process. Use an Asana board as an easy visual tracking tool. You create the backlog of tasks, they can assign themselves and move the cards to through the various steps until completion. Give leadership read access to the board so they can check in at any time to see the status of each hire.\n\nManagement doesn't like meetings? Send out a weekly status email instead with very clear calls to action to unblock workflows. Put the \"currently blocked\" section at the top of the email. Blockers would usually be management approvals or actions (justifications), things you wouldn't be able to help alleviate by working with the HR team in the standing meeting. Nicely putting leaders on blast in a group email can spur them to take action so they don't look like the bottleneck. You don't have to think of it as blaming or calling people out, just stating the facts of next steps for the workflow.\n\nPut some focus on timelines since your boss recommended that. Work it into your email, maybe a column for days since opening and a green/yellow/red highlight to whether things are on track.\n\nTo make sure you're not going way outside your bounds and getting yourself fired, you can collaborate with your boss to adjust language/tone and make sure you're accomplishing what you need to with the email.",

          "text": "I had a similar trajectory, and best I can tell you is that it only really works if others are using Asana, too. The projects I've been assigned to \"wrangle\" or \"organize\" that \"require an Asana project\" just sit there with myself as the only user. I've learned to spot these ahead of time because those types of projects usually just need a document of a project plan with milestones that can be used as checkpoints. Asana is great for large or cross-functional projects where you can use things like multihoming and AI summaries of weekly activities. Otherwise, it may be overkill for the actual work that your department does and a good set of Excel and Word templates can suffice. \n\nThe other thing I had to do around my transition time from comms to PM is pivot to creating/documenting the operational processes overall when I didn't have other meaningful work to do. It helped me wrap my brain around how the department should work collaboratively on the operational level, and my PM skills then were flexed to influence functional change.\n\nI will say that I was not really ever authorized to take charge on this stuff (an org should have a PM at the table as a strategic partner, otherwise, you're an admin or a coordinator/traffic manager). I step up where I see a leadership void or ambiguity and work to create frameworks and processes. Basically, I just do it, and ask forgiveness later, always with the view of supporting the overall mission and leaving it better than I found it. I've only gotten told that I've overstepped maybe twice in 3 years, and they're otherwise happy that I've contributed to the overall department to make it work better.",

Hr is not asking for more resources. Should we start a project to improve their workflow? Let’s say they or someone is asking for resources. You set a schedule. 40 hours per week, their manager wants them to work X % on projects Y % on admin (travel, those meetings you attend etc. B% on personal/lost time usually 8 hours. Then if you present the data this way they would get value in saying “look! My team has the most projects/spread the thinnest, we have justification for a fte”. You will get a that data is not good because people don’t report their time etc. the you work with that manager to defines schedule and expectations with their team.

      "text": "Hi All,\n\n   \nI believe this is the proper sub to post on. I just started as a PM for an IT asset management project sorting out issues inside servicenow. Currently the team is heavily reactive, excel, email, and teams based. My very first job in IT in 2014 I worked two years without a help desk system and I never want to go back to that. I have been here six months just doing basic trainings, excel projects like sorting data and testing scripts for people who need it done. There is no structure to really any of this and often I don't even get a date when the thing is due or why I am working on it. I do have clear goals set like test this project. But sometimes I get little duties to clean or fix datasheets in excel etc... \n\n**The Avalanche of Emails Friday Afternoon:**\n\nThis past week I had to work on three projects and it got down to the wire. Friday afternoon I was still updating code, scripts, and testing a feature with constant pushback from stakeholders and leadership (if something changed in the excel after approval etc). Different parties sending me different emails with different results. This happens often and then we have meetings to clarify.\n\nSo after I finished all my work at 3 PM I decided to look around the agency's tools to see what was being underutilized and not up to date. I live in the intersection of IT and dev so I have some admin rights to a lot of the cloud software jira, servicenow etc... \n\n**What I have done/working on:**\n\nWe had project boards in jira and wikis that haven't been updated since 2023. We don't utilize tasks or time tracking in jira. I started doing this on friday and showed my leadership who was pleased to see this functionality. Before the tracking board I would send my boss a report of what I did each day. \n\n**What we don't have:**\n\nWe don't have approvals or workflows for my team set up in servicenow (mostly because nobody knows how but i certainly can build it with the right research). I have also requested to work with the development team to get this access or even to work with the team more.\n\n**Tasks are discussed and done via memory and hardly any documentation:**  \n\nMy question is is this often what happens on the PM track? We are a small team consisting of two division chiefs and myself. We work with a few other teams like dev, and various branches of IT. I don't believe they have a centralized system or trusted source of knowledge either. A lot of things are done on the fly based on memory. Most of the teams meetings are about remembering what they did years ago with scattered documentation nobody knows exists.\n\n**What's the best way to setup a formalized intake process for the team?**\n\nIs there anything else I should focus on? I am thinking that I need to have a formalized intake process each of these teams need to utilize when they request something or change something that relates to our team. This for better auditing and tracking. \n\nAny other tips or suggestions would be very useful and appreciated. ",

I hope I can create a good intake form (guessing this can be done in jira), and show the other teams not to be afraid of it either.

          "text": "What you’re describing is pretty normal in teams that never really had structure to begin with. And yes, this *is* often what the start of a PM role looks like in places like this.\n\nThe problem isn’t Jira vs ServiceNow vs Excel. It’s that work is coming at you with no clear why, no real deadline, and no one actually owning the decision. That’s why everything blows up late on Fridays — urgency gets manufactured at the end because it was never framed properly at the start.\n\nWhat you did by reviving boards and tracking work is fine, but be careful here. The fastest way to burn out is becoming the person who builds structure *for everyone* without the authority to enforce it. That turns you into the system instead of the system doing the work.\n\nOn intake — your instinct is right. But keep it simple. You don’t need a heavy process. You just need a gate. \n\nEvery request should answer:\n\n* what’s being asked, \n* why it matters, \n* when it’s needed, and \n* what happens if it doesn’t get done. \n\nIf it can’t answer those, it’s not ready. Full stop.\n\nI’d hold off on building fancy workflows for now. Not because they’re bad, but because automating chaos just makes chaos faster. Until there’s agreement on how decisions get made, tooling won’t fix much.\n\nA lot of what you’re feeling is just seeing the mess clearly for the first time. That’s not failure — that’s awareness. The trick is deciding which problems you surface and which ones you don’t try to personally absorb.\n\nFocus on fixing how work *enters* the system. If you get that right, everything downstream gets easier. If you don’t, no tool will save you.",
