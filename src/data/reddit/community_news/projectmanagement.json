      "text": "For most of my career I watched the same cycle repeat.\n\nSomeone gets hurt or nearly hurt. Leadership responds with more training. More signage. More toolbox talks. Crews nod along. The behavior doesn't change. Six months later, same incident, different person.\n\nThe one that finally broke the cycle for me happened on a remote pipeline job in northern Alberta.\n\nWe had a protocol: specific tools had to come from the equipment yard, roughly 200 yards from the active work zone. The safe procedure was clear. Walk back, get the right tool, walk back out.\n\nNobody did it.\n\nThey used whatever was within reach. Every time. We disciplined people. We retrained people. We posted reminders. The workaround persisted because the workaround was efficient and the procedure was inconvenient.\n\nThe fix wasn't more training. It was pre-staging tool kits at each work zone and eliminating the 200-yard walk entirely.\n\nBehavior changed immediately. Not because people suddenly cared more about safety. Because we stopped designing a system where the safe choice was the hard choice.\n\nWhat I eventually understood after 25 years in the field: the system chooses the behavior more than the individual does. If your procedure requires people to consistently choose inconvenience over efficiency, your procedure will lose. Every time.\n\nThe question that changed how I managed everything after that: are we asking people to do the right thing, or are we designing systems where the right thing is also the easy thing?",

It was redesigning the workflow so the safe action was also the most efficient action.\nMost organizations miss: if compliance requires friction, friction will win.\nBut when you remove waste, you don’t have to enforce behavior – you align it.\nThat principle scales across industries as well, but I focus on construction.",

Long story short about 3 weeks after implementing the change system we had a major outage and rather than taking hours, the on call engineer went to the change management system and found the problem in 20 minutes.  The hook was set because the team found benefits in the system but I also managed to get further intangible benefits because I was able to get analytics from the system, the team turned the system in to a game of challenge of who could log the most change requests, this was a totally unexpected benefit but it also helped mold the team's organisational behaviour.\n\nThis experience has been one of my biggest lessons in my professional career, if your system doesn't show benefit or you can't get buy in, you can't force users regardless of what you do. Work with your stakeholders to ensure that you have their input because it's part of the buy in process. Oh and the guy who gave me absolute grief, he turned out to be the biggest user of the system, I was making some huge assumptions on my behalf and one them thinking he was just being an a-hole but the funny thing he only wanted two minor things changed to make it more efficient for him (not such an unreasonable request at the end of the day).\n\nJust an armchair perspective",

In a lot of the cases, people already know the procedure. The real issue is friction. If the safe or correct option is slower, harder, or inconvenient, the workaround will win almost every time.\n\nThe pipeline example captures that perfectly. The behaviour did not change because people suddenly cared more. It changed because the system stopped forcing them to choose between efficiency and safety. Once the right option became the easy option, the workaround disappeared.\n\nThat lesson applies far beyond that type of work. You see the same pattern in offices, healthcare, nonprofits, everywhere. Staff bypass clunky processes, skip steps that slow client response, and create informal shortcuts just to keep work moving. Leaders often treat this as a compliance or attitude issue, when it is really a design issue.\n\nThe question you ended with is the one more leaders need to sit with….. are we asking people to do the right thing, or designing systems where the right thing is also the easy thing?\n\nWhen systems are built around how work actually happens, behaviour changes without pressure, discipline, or repeated retraining.

Synthesizing customer feedback, pulling patterns from call transcripts, getting to sharper priorities faster. The inputs are better than they've ever been atleast for the most part.\n\nStill I keep hitting the same wall I have hit in most aspects of my roles. Someone senior has already decided what the quarter looks like and the data doesn't really matter at that point.I'm trying to sort out what data or insights would drive meaningful prioritization decisions.\n\nSo I'm starting to wonder if the whole \"be more data driven\" thing is just something we tell ourselves to feel better about a process that's actually just politics and whoever talked to the CEO last.\n\nWould love to be proved me wrong.

If they choose not to follow your advice or guidance regardless of it be political or them being clueless, then that is on them; In which you can clearly show through your IT systems,  decision, issues and risk logs of business transactions that have occurred (or in a crude way of putting it, you have just covered your behind). \n\nIf you're documenting accordingly, particularly with decision making and the ownership of that, you have been diligent in your role as the PM (again, rightly or wrongly) but it's not your responsibility because your project board/sponsor/executive is ultimately responsible for the success of the project, as the project manager you're responsible for the day to day business transactions and the delivery quality of your project.

Leadership wanted to trim part of the budget because on paper it looked like overhead. But we had enough structured reporting and follow-up history to show that the stuff they wanted to cut was tied directly to repeat issues, slow closeouts, and rising exposure in the field. Once it became “cut this and here’s the likely downstream hit,” the conversation changed fast.\n\nSo I’d say data works best when it’s tied to consequences leadership actually feels. If it stays as insight, politics wins. If it becomes risk with a price tag, people suddenly get very interested. Have to hit them where it hurts as to say.",

Of course, the specific idea may change directions a bit. But let’s say you report to a manager who’s below a director and you heard a speech or read an email from the CEO. There will be a request about implementing topic X or integrating topic X eventually. If you’re able to get a plan or story together through the data before your manager receives their directive, you’re in a great position to influence their decisions\n\nIn my previous company, C levels were considered the ultimate authorities so everyone tried to do what they want. If you know that and have an answer before they even raise a question, you make their lives easier and yours by proxy",

What you're getting is a single perspective from an individual that has had experience which may be very different from your own current situation.  I've seen some of my mentoree's try and follow a principle or approach of where they read something and thinking it was right but couldn't actually understand why their approach was failing. \n\nThe other thing to consider as a PM you just don't use a single discipline, experienced and more seasoned PM use numerous disciplines and principles such as finance, HR, contracts, procurement, change management, quality assurance management, operational management, subject matter expertise and the most important two disciplines is Emotional Quotient (EQ) or people soft skills and strategic positioning.  You have to understand these disciplines and master them with the more complex projects and programs that you undertake in the future. People in this thread will offer you suggestions because it was something that they have come across and resonated with them but if you find something which resonates, great then try it but also if it doesn't work then drop it. Don't keep on trying and hoping for a different outcome because that is the definition of insanity and it's amazing to see PM's consistently making the same mistakes. \n\nWhilst I'm not saying not to read but just to highlight the point that there is also no silver bullet to put you on the fast track to be a great practitioner, the only thing that does is practical experience. Also overtime as an experienced practitioner you will learn what doesn't and does work for you as your confidence and experience grows and your style emerges.  In short, take what ever you read and find out what does or doesn't work for you but also take it with a grain of salt because it's an individual's perspective and nothing more and don't fall into the trap thinking it's gospel or the only way to do things. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.

Not the technically complex work in the middle of the project.\n\nThe last 20%.\n\nBy the time a crew is in final cleanup, something invisible has already happened. The mental finish line moved. Guys who followed procedure perfectly for three months start cutting corners they wouldn't have touched in week two. Inspectors who caught everything start catching less. The standard that held all winter quietly drops - not because anyone decided to lower it, but because everyone's brain already handed in its resignation.\n\nI've watched it happen on every long project I've ever run.\n\nThe cold and the hard work don't break the system. Anticipation does.\n\nWhen people can see the end, they stop running the process that got them there. Fatigue is real - minus 40, camp food for three months, boots so muddy they weigh twice what they should. But the incidents in the final stretch aren't just fatigue incidents. They're attention incidents. The brain stops scanning for what could go wrong because it's already planning the drive home.\n\nThe fix isn't more safety meetings in the final week. It's understanding that the last 20% needs more system, not less - precisely because everyone's instinct is to run less of it.\n\nDesign your end-of-project protocols the same way you designed your startup protocols. Because the job isn't done until it's done.\n\nAre we designing our systems to hold through the finish line, or just to the point where everyone stops paying attention?\n\nFor those who've been there - what did the last 20% actually look like on your worst project?",

I remember I was very anxious during my first client presentation.\nHere are some tips that could help you \n- do box breathing before the meeting , drink a few sips of water , try to take a walk if you can or listen to your fav song before the meeting\n- prepare well in advance / practice before mirror/ it's okay to pause during présentations to refer notes. It's okay to say - I will come back to you after the meeting if you don't know the answer.\n- make sure to Include all key numbers / points in the slides you are  presenting so that you don't forget - this reduces the fear of getting struck or forgetting \n- they are normal people who also started as juniors - you are here to deliver the key messages and you will improve with experience \n- Also there are free YouTube videos that provide strategies for improving  communication & presentation skills \n\nIf you feel anxious during all of your daily tasks - you should check your blood panels.",

I have been trying to learn the ins and outs of managing a project and how to do it effectively. From running this project as my first major NPD project, I am a newfound respect for project management and how it is a very difficult thing to do.\n\n  \nAny who I am running into this problem of my weekly stand-up meeting getting \"hijacked\" by people. Today my bosses boss decided to sit in on our meeting. He heard something that he didn't agree with and went off on a 30-minute tangent that was not adding any value to our meeting or discussion. He forced me to go through various ERP screens to find an answer he was looking for, then proceeded to tell me I should know this process better (even though he didn't know it as well as he thought). Then at the final minutes of the meeting he decided to go on another tangent and the meeting ended up lasting an additional hour. Not sure the best way to tell a director that he is getting us off task?\n\n  \nAnother example is another engineer who is working on the project. He has been a great recourse but is very fixated on certain things. He works in R&D (actually is the lab manager) and does not really care about the timeline at all. He also doesn't care much for following standard processes. So, he constant brings up things that are not big issues and could easily be addressed post launch and are not showstoppers. He often interrupts me and won't let things go. My boss is aware of this and doesn't do much to back me up or put an end of things. So again, a person who is technically above me at a manager level that I can't really tell to buzz off...\n\n  \nI would love any advice a seasoned project manager could give me!",

Let me start with general advice, then your colleague, and then get to him.\n\nSo, generally, it’s a best practice to send the meeting agenda in advance.  You can include it in the meeting invite. It helps people prepare, and gives you something to point to if people get off track.  Then, at the start of the meeting, you can review the agenda and ask if anyone has any concerns/questions about the planned agenda.\n\nFrom there, it really gets into soft skills as well as technical knowledge. If someone takes the conversation in a different direction, I will usually let them go for a minute or two, then (sometimes rudely) jump in and ask if the conversation is relevant to the meeting agenda, or if it can be added to the meeting’s “parking lot”, and discussed at the end of the meeting once non-relevant invitees have left. Or, does there need to be a specific meeting about that topic?\n\nSometimes (rarely), someone is bringing up an issue that affects the project and needs to be discussed right then, in which case I’ll: 1. ask if we have right people to discuss it, and try to bring in anyone needed, and 2. promise to reschedule the original meeting once we clear the issue.\n\nFinally, dealing with leaders: you can try to get them to agree to a parking lot, but sometimes they are on a power trip and won’t agree.  In which case, sometimes you have to put up with it, but should discuss it with your boss to see if they have any tips.  Then, of course, reschedule your original call and leave them out ( if you can). \n\nDepending on the personalities involved, you may even schedule a one on one with him to discuss the information he needs to see  how you can get to him without him hijacking your meeting.  \n\nUltimately, however, the most important thing is that the information is getting to the right people at the right time to keep the project moving forward.  You may be able to make up the difference with an email chain or a slack /teams chat instead. \n\nSo, TL:DR:\n\n1. Publish the agenda before\n\n2. Stress the agenda at the start of the meeting, and get agreement from the team\n\n3. Encourage tangents to move to the parking lot, but make sure they do get discussed\n\n4. Escalate problems with your boss, and determine how your boss’ boss can best get the info he needs without hijacking your meetings. ",

This means you need to tell people when they get off topic, or are hijacking the meeting. \n\nMake sure your meeting has an agenda where **at the end** you leave time for a bit of open discussion. \n\nIf you veer off topic, cut the individual off immediately. This is the uncomfortable part. You need to explain “this is off topic for the meeting and if we have time at the end I can help you set up your own meeting to address that”. \n\nKeep it professional and take repeat offenders aside and directly tell them they cannot continue attending the meetings if they don’t follow protocol. Follow this directive up to them in an email. Cc their boss if you feel it needs the escalation. \n\nYou will very quickly build a reputation as a no nonsense meeting guide.

Once projects are really rolling my progress meetings usually take less than 15 mins.  Consultants love me for giving them back time.\n\nAlso when you send out the agenda ahead of time ask if there are any items you missed.   If someone brings something up that isn’t on the agenda table it and give them a call later.\n\nPut action items at the top of your meeting minutes with assignments.

When management wants to get involved in a standup (which should be a quick working meeting), as a PM I would always ask the question: \"what is your objective in attending the meeting?\". That will help you uncover what the leader is looking for and determine if their expectation can be met in another meeting instead. It could also help you uncover something you aren't serving in how you are communicating or managing and that then provides a path that eliminates this behavior. \n\nFor the engineer that has a different definition of \"done\" from the project's level of acceptance, establishing that clarity is likely going to resolve the issue. This could be done a few different ways. First, if a definition of done doesn't exist, try creating one that everyone agrees to. Then this can be referenced if people get fixated on something that goes beyond the idea of \"done\". Another option, is my preferred approach, which is to document success criteria in your project charter and then transfer these to applicable deliverables as \"acceptance criteria\". Clear acceptance criteria on work items can help to curb the behavior as an alternative to a \"definition of done\". This individual's behavior can also be a sign of feeling undervalued, so pay attention to offering kudos where due and to building rapport that shows them you do appreciate their investment and style, even if you object to some of their ideas.",

      "text": "I started a new role as a Project Lead on February 17th. It’s a two pay grade promotion with a solid base salary increase, and I recently earned my PMP, so this felt like a huge career milestone for me.\n\nI’ve been assigned to a large project consolidating five different software systems into one enterprise-wide platform. There are multiple workstreams tied to each system, like HR, finance, reporting, etc. I’m the lead for the finance workstream.\n\nHere’s where it gets tricky.\n\nThe finance workstream technically started about four to six months ago. They were waiting on approval to officially hire and assign project leads to each workstream, which is why I’m just now coming in. Two other new leads will also be starting soon.\n\nThe gentleman who has been running the finance workstream up to this point has never had a project lead. He told me we’ll figure out what “my role” looks like as we go. I understand that some clarity takes time. I’m not expecting everything to be perfectly defined in week one.\n\nBut right now, I’m being treated like an administrative assistant rather than a project lead.\n\nI’m being asked to run Zoom AI Companion during meetings, organize and distribute notes, schedule workshops that are already fully structured with titles, attendees, and homework assignments defined. Basically execution support tasks, not leadership or strategic oversight.\n\nNone of my performance objectives include admin work. They’re focused on delivery, stakeholder alignment, risk management, governance, and outcomes. I worked hard for this promotion and certification. I did not step into this role to manage meeting minutes.\n\nTo add another layer, my direct manager is not part of this project. She already warned me that another project lead on a different workstream is not being utilized appropriately and told me to make sure I escalate if needed. So I know I’m not crazy for sensing this might become a pattern.\n\nOn top of that, the workstream lead has already made it clear he prefers people in the office and isn’t thrilled that I’m home based. That’s not changing. My role is remote eligible and that was part of the agreement.  I’ve worked remote since 2009 and it has never interfered with my performance.\n\nIt’s been a bit of a crushing first week. I’m already feeling anxious about tomorrow, which is not how I expected to feel stepping into a promotion I was excited about.\n\nI’m planning to address role clarity directly in our next meeting and align expectations to my stated objectives, but I want to do it professionally and early before this dynamic sets in permanently.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar, especially stepping into a project midstream where someone has been operating without formal structure? How did you establish authority and role clarity without coming across as territorial or difficult?\n\nWould appreciate any advice.",

Learn about the project.   Get to know the team including the arrogant chauvinist.  Continue having conversations and doing your research about your role, but do so from a position of “how I can help the workstream and project” and not, “why is nobody respecting my new title?”.       \n\nYou also don’t want the current workstream lead to say, “ok, you want to be in charge?  Take charge. I’ll step back and wait until you assign me a task”. \n\nDemanding people respect your title, before you know your stuff and have  earned that respect, usually isn’t a winning formula.",

The project gets assigned a project team, who usually have indirect reporting line to the project manager, for the duration of their involvement in the project. \n\nThey may get a direct reporting line to project manager, but that's less common.\n\nAs a workstream lead, I assume that you temporarily (for the duration of the project) have indirect/dotted line reporting to the project manager.\n\nIf so, try to get closer to the project manager, ask him/her what their expectations are, what can you do to add more value to the project.\n\nMost project managers appreciate very much workstream leads who take ownership and show initiative. You can teach someone the job, but it's hard to teach someone the right attitude.\n\nIf your project manager and team members are in-office some days a week, perhaps you can make a routine to be in-office once or twice a week?

I am not sure if I have met with the lead that my leader mentioned about not “being used accordingly” as there are at least 12 PLs on this project for many different workstream. It’s a HUGE transformation.  It’s been in the works for over year and now my workstream is starting and ends in mid 2028. \n\nI am unable to go into the office as I am not close to headquarters. Most of our matrix workstream members are not close as they are on east & west coast, and offshore in the Middle East. The PM is HBA as well.  This gentleman is just a headquartered guy who has worked at the firm 25 years and stuck in his ways, sadly.  I am going to try to look at it optimistically that he says “I’ve never had a project lead before,” so he just needs to know project lead doesn’t mean administrative assistant, otherwise they could have hired someone at half my base pay for that. I just need to be eloquent, but I can tell he is going to be a tough person to work with already. (See other replies above).",

It kind of makes sense that you'd be doing administrative work in your very first week. It's a way to ease the burden on others while getting up to speed - since onboarding you is more work for them. That's an easy trade and makes sense for five days on the job. \n\n\nMostly though, I would look at this differently. Try to see this from this other person point of view. Why are they being replaced? Are they expected to report to you, when they have been independent so far? Why - what changed? What are they meant to do instead of what they have been doing? What leadership needs are there that you provide than an insider can't or hasn't? Understand where they are coming from, then work backwards to ease their concern. \n\n\nThen, when you work together to develop the formal transition plan - which is what you need - you'll understand the baggage they bring with them.",

              "text": "I’m with the same company. I’ve been at the firm four years. I was a project coordinator in another department prior.  When I applied for the PL role, I expected to be declined due to my pay grade, but I have my PMP, which was required, so I took a chance.  It’s not common for employees to be hired for a role two grades above at our company. I was shocked I was picked to interview. I figured it was just to “get the #s” so they could meet candidates criteria and offer to someone else waiting in the pipeline already. So when they contacted to offer the role I was floored - two above my grade = good promotion & increase in pay (not common in our firm at all). \n\nThe person I’m concerned with isn’t being replaced, he is a main stakeholder of six in my matrix team that I will be leading - he is a top leader in finance so he working in the workstream.  He will remain in the workstream in the planning, sprints, and working on the granular technical things I would not customarily be involved in. Yet, I’m being asked to be in all of these meetings to take notes, run zoom, launch AI compaction, send out notes and PowerPoints after meetings… things that an admin would do.  I spoke to another lead (not mentioning what I was being asked to do) and they are deep in strategic transition and planning. I asked if they scheduled all the workshops and what not and she said “nope, that’s nope our scope of work as a lead.” \n\nTrying to be optimistic, but I’m REALLY good at reading people and can figure someone out pretty quickly- and I’m rarely wrong about a person. So I am hesitant knowing my gut is telling me I’m stepping into a role with a strong male personality who seems to be pretty … hate to say- arrogant, and maybe even a bit chauvinistic.  He literally said in a meeting Friday to a young female offshore contractor “looks like you’re ready to go clubbing and be off this call cause you’re all dressed up, unlike your usual” - it was 9p where she was and 9am for us. She didn’t seem enthused by his comment. I felt bad for her. Of course, I don’t know their working relationship, but I could read the zoom room when it was said. \n\nI will def take your advice and try to work backwards to find answers to the points you’ve brought up. I guess he just really rubbed me the wrong way on my first week. Now I’m laying here wide awake worried when I’d usually be asleep two hours by now.",

You're surprised by the promotion; I'd bet this stakeholder would be too - in fact, does this stakeholder even know something has meaningfully changed? Has a conversation been had with them about what your role is, or are you *both* making assumptions? Because probably this stakeholder hasn't thought about this at all, or at least I find that it almost always the case. \n\n\nThe other thing that springs to mind is, what strategic transition and planning needs to be happening that someone one week into the role would be doing instrad of what you are doing now? This is where the transition plan comes in. It takes time to onboard and hand off a project, especially as a leader. \n\n\n>  I’m REALLY good at reading people and can figure someone out pretty quickly- \n\n\nThis is a red flag to me.\n\n\nBut regardless, even if it is true, you can't handle this stakeholder from that point of view. Dismissing or making assumptions or setting your behavior about the stakeholder because of a vibe, even if that is 100% true, is a recipe for failure. Unfortunately, we have to work with shitty people all the time. Put that energy toward figuring out how to work with this person, regardless of whether they suck. One key to that is to figure out where they are coming from and why. \n\n\nBut, for the record, admin work is alert of the job. No, I usually wouldn't do it for a functional team's workshops or what have you, but I still own that work for the project or program's operating rhythm. Explaining the difference is often something j have to do, so best to come up with a script for it now. You'll be using it a lot in your career! ",

There are definitely other factors at play. \n\nConsider culture. If you are in a country where role definitions are extremely explicit and rigidly followed, your husband may have the more appropriate view. \nIn some cultures, it maybe more common to ease an individual into the rule. Your apprehension is understandable, given the possible positive or negative possible consequences in this circumstance. \n\nAt best, I would suggest you to attempt greater responsibilities as much as you can once you understand environment and responsibilities well.",

For the other project leads who don't do it, who does? Based on what you've said here - that in this structure, a project lead is beneath a project manager but above a coordinator - I would assume either a coordinator or a lead if not the ideal, which is that the team would share responsibilities (randomly assigned at the start of the meeting, role as assigned weekly, always done by the owner of the meeting, etc.).",

This comes back to the understanding of roles and responsibilities of your stakeholder but there is a caveat, if the meeting is to propose any changes to the project's triple constraint of time, cost and scope, then discretion is needed or at the very least have the meeting minuted with the decisions, actions or outcomes clearly documented. \n\nAs the PM you're not expected to know the ins and outs of every task, work package, product or deliverable (hence, roles and responsibilities) however you do need to be aware on how they impact the schedule. E.g. if you have a senior technical lead, it's their responsibility to develop and design and ensure the technical delivery,  you as the PM are responsible for the quality of the delivery and ensuring that it's fit for purpose e.g. using test/use case, applying quality assurances against the deliverable, work package or product etc. \n\nIf you were to attend every project's side meeting there won't be enough hours in the week for you to do your job, let alone attending meetings that you're not needed for. As you become more seasoned as a project practitioner you start to learn which meetings you should or shouldn't be attending. I would also start contacting the meeting chairs and ask if you indeed needed to be there and why. As a personal preference I set very clear expectations if there is no agenda and an open invite I don't attend and especially if the meeting has been set for an hour or more.   \n\nIf someone wants to call a meeting, it's their responsibility to ensure that A) the meeting is warranted B) the relevant stakeholders are invited and ensure there is a quorum that is able to make decisions if needed C) The meeting must have an agenda (NOTE: this is where significant project costs can be incurred when meetings don't have an agenda and it becomes a talk fest with no real outcomes) D) the meeting must be  minuted. You need to make those responsible to take responsibility, as the PM you don't carry everything. \n\nJust an armchair perspective. ",

For example, pulling context from previous meetings before a call starts, running a real-time meeting assistant during the call to capture decisions, then auto-generating follow-up tasks and summaries afterward. I wonder have you built any effective workflows with lean tool stack? What parts of the workflow actually saved time versus adding complexity?",

It's a one pager that outlines a project overview and objectives (5), deliverable milestones (5) and the top five issues and risks in bullet point or those that need their immediate action, it can just be all bullet point overviews. I would also request a 1:1 meeting to provide any contextual Q & A's in relation to your top 5 paper (give them the option). I have found this approach very effective for both the stakeholder and myself because it allows me to set the tone and outline my expectations (yes I do that with senior stakeholders) and the stakeholder to outline theirs.

      "text": "Looking for advice on best apprach out of a project thats in chaos. I'll admit I'm partially to blame also due to not standing up to some individuals and allowing scope creep. \n\nSo project started 1 year ago, basically an IT upgrade, hardware procurement, app upgrade and data migration. In that  time 2 board approved changes in scope. All straight forward so far. \n\nScope changes\n 1) addition of preproduction environment. Simple enough just extended schedule and cost\n2) changes in hardware requirements. This is where it gets problematic. One of the board (my line manager and reaponsible for my contract renewal) has used this CR to ram in a pet technology he wants for a new tech without having to go through approvals for it. I missed it (didnt realise the inpact and was told it would take 3 weeks to implement) and the change was approved by the board. \n\nProblem is now we are 6 months late because of this addition of the different tech. Budget is blown because of the unforseen costs of the scope creep and (I'll admit) my failure to account for the costs of the 2 CRs and revise the budget earlier. \n\nNow I need to present to the board and outline the issues, projected costs and path to success (and not get fired)\n\nI'm baffled how to phrase it, maybe I'm too close to the problems. But issues are\n1) poc caused significant delays and cost over run\n2) costs of changes not factored in earlier and budget revised. Now I need to revise the budget and hardware costs have gone up by nearly 200%\n3) uncertainty on when hardware is going to be available. Basically the poc guy manages hardware and he's dragging his behind on deciding soec and saying it ain't my concern. But this project depends on the availability of the hardware and is supposed to fund the price.\n4) person that rammed stuff in is difficult and confrontational. Can't openly pin blame on them as it will become antagonistic \n\nLooking for a way to summarise this and provide a decent path to green and no matter what I write it just doesn't seem to highlight how the scope creep and governance failures  have impacted everything.

          "text": "Firstly, breathe as people don't die in ditches over things like this, but to be honest it's going to get a bit bumpy for a while but seriously keep in mind that it's only a temporary situation. Secondly, the reality is that you have lost control of your project because you've had changes to your approved baselined project but the reality is that you've not administered them due diligently, which should become a very important learning lesson for you.\n\nA suggested approach is to go back to your original business case and start mapping out your project's chronology of events and the changes and the decisions made as the evidence of change and what the impact that it had over your original baselined project. I would also suggest that you propose or recommend to your project board/sponsor/executive to placing the project on a momentary or temporary hold in order for you to rebaseline your project. From a project administration perspective is that you need to go back through and revise or update your project controls (issues & risk logs, milestones, deliverables, project schedule and your project plan and to reflect the new delivery date but the most important thing is to have the new baseline approved (first and foremost).  The key is once you rebaseline your project your only focus is your triple constraint and you need to actively manage your exceptions. The golden rule is if any one of the constraints of time, cost or change then the other two must change. All you do is ask if which one do they want to change because it's a causal effect relationship between the constraints and all your doing is putting the responsibility back on to the requestor and asking them to choose. Trust me, it sorts out pretty quickly if the change is really warranted or not.\n\nAlso keep in mind the person who rammed their agenda through can't dispute the facts when you can show evidence of where and how they got their change through but it also means that you have to be honest with your project board/sponsor/executive and admit that you could have handled this a little better (this is your lessons learned as a project practitioner, your triple constraint of time, cost and scope is your only priority and you have to document any exception to that agreed and approved baseline).\n\nGet your ducks lined up in a row and at your next status meeting raise the matter, the reality is the longer you leave it the worse it becomes. Go ready with your mapped chronology of events, understand your risks and issues, more importantly go with a proposed idea (e.g. a course of action) and ask for your project board/sponsor/executive for guidance on the matter.\n\nThe reality is that your project board/sponsor/executive is actually responsible for the success of the project, your responsibilities is to ensure the day to day business transactions are delivered. Keep in mind the project board/sponsor/executive can't nor shouldn't hang you out to dry on this because they're at fault just as much as you are. Good luck and this will work itself out in the end, just remember you need to be a little more diligent when handling change.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

      "text": "Good afternoon to anyone reading this. I’m sharing my experience to hopefully stop someone else from making the same mistake I did during my first Gov Contract Role:\n\nI’ve worked as a Project Coordinator and Junior Project Manager for about five years in Film, Tech, and Healthcare, mostly with NGOs. After seeing former classmates succeed with IT staffing firms, I uploaded my resume to many platforms like Dice.com. For over a year, recruiters reached out but nothing came of it. I eventually landed my current role through a traditional hiring process.\n\nAbout a month into that job, a recruiter contacted me again and I allowed them to represent me. Days later, I received multiple excited calls saying I’d been selected for interviews. I completed two rounds (Teams, then in person) for a Technical Project Manager role and quickly received an offer. With my JIRA Agile certification and location, things moved fast.\n\nThe offer was life-changing: six figures and aligned perfectly with my plan to earn my PMP this year. A very thorough background check followed—schools, employers, references, certifications, DMV—the works. The process lasted nearly three months, during which I continued working my current job while onboarding on breaks. I also negotiated limited PTO and paid holidays, which I was comfortable with given the salary.\n\nHERE’S WHERE EVERYTHING WENT WRONG\n\nBefore a required Non-DOT drug screening, the recruiter asked if I used anything recreationally. I told her I used THC on weekends and lived in Virginia, where it’s decriminalized. She assured me this would not be an issue.\n\nTHIS WAS MY BIGGEST MISTAKE\n\nI had never taken a 7-panel drug test or worked with a government-contracted company. What I didn’t research myself was that the client held federal contracts and followed federal zero-tolerance policies for Schedule I substances, regardless of state law. Trusting the recruiter, I abstained briefly (3 weeks) took the test, and thought nothing of it.\n\nA week later, an MRO informed me my sample contained trace THC. I explained the Non-DOT status and state legality, but they clarified the company followed federal policy. I panicked. The recruiter’s entire team became involved, admitted they hadn’t fully understood the client’s policy, and immediately scheduled a second test. I fully abstained and passed.\n\nDespite advocacy from the recruiter and my would-be manager, the company enforced a strict rule: any positive result during onboarding meant automatic offer rescission—even with a subsequent negative test. The offer was pulled.\n\nI wrote an emotional appeal to HR, but they were firm. DOT and VDOT later confirmed I wasn’t federally regulated as a Non-DOT employee, but that only meant company policy applied—and this company had zero tolerance and no rehabilitation exceptions.\n\nThe job was gone.\n\nWHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE: Never rely solely on a recruiter’s assurances. They aren’t bad people, but they are salespeople. If something isn’t explicitly confirmed in writing, verify it yourself. I trusted vague answers instead of doing my own research—and paid the price.\n\nI fell hard but eventually recovered. I had to humble myself to get my old job back, but I’m sharing this to help others protect themselves. We work too hard for our education and certifications to lose opportunities over assumptions. Verify everything—use Google, ChatGPT, anything—before making life-changing decisions.\n\nI’m embarrassed and disappointed, but I’m only 27, and it’s not over. One thing is certain: I will never fail another 7-panel drug test again.\n\nThank you for your time,",

      "text": "Hi guys,\n\nMaybe this isn't the right place to ask, but I’d genuinely value some feedback from experienced PMs here. I’ve worked a number of years in project controls (mainly infrastructure / large programs), and Ive noticed projects keep running into the same issue:\n\nWe manage highly uncertain projects using single-number baselines and fairly subjective (if they even exist) risk registers. When things slip, we’re surprised even though the uncertainty was always there.\n\nSo I’ve been experimenting with something I call a “Control Framework” that treats uncertainty as something measurable and repeatable rather than something descriptive (based on RISMAN method. I think it's mostly a Dutch thing but I'm sure there's other similar ways of incorperating riskmanagement).\n\nThe core idea of the framework is:\n\n* Use Monte Carlo not as a one-off risk exercise, but as a recurring measurement unit.\n* Express schedule/cost forecasts in probabilities (P50/P80 etc.) instead of single dates.\n* Identify actual risk drivers via sensitivity rather than relying only on qualitative registers.\n* Aggregate portfolio-level confidence mathematically consistently (instead of averaging P-values or buffers).\n* Create a governance loop: planning → quantified risk → simulation → decision insight → repeat.\n\nI’ve put the concept into a small website (built with the help of vibe-coding and AI tools). It’s still early-stage and very much exploratory.\n\nWhat I’d really like to understand from this community:\n\n1. Is this a way of working you would actually use in your projects?\n2. What would immediately make you skeptical?\n3. What’s missing from this concept from a real PM perspective?\n4. Would this help you in steering committees / governance discussions, or would it create more friction?\n5. Where else would you suggest sharing or testing an idea like this?\n6. Are there adjacent opportunities I might be overlooking?\n\nI’m not trying to sell anything, I’m genuinely trying to test whether this solves a real pain or just a theoretical one.  So if anyone is willing to look at the site and give blunt feedback, I’d appreciate it a lot.\n\nThanks in advance@ And if this isn’t the right subreddit for this kind of discussion, I’m happy to remove the post.\n\n  \n[https://prosim-control-studio.vercel.app/](https://prosim-control-studio.vercel.app/)",

      "text": "Resource planning only works if project timelines are somewhat predictable but agency projects change constantly, timelines slip, new projects come in last minute, clients pause projects unexpectedly. By the time you make a resource plan it's already outdated and wrong. The typical approach is planning resource allocation weeks or months in advance but that's basically fiction in agency world, maybe 30% of what you plan actually happens as planned. Better to have rolling 2 week resource plans that get updated constantly than 3 month plans that are wrong immediately and never get updated. Utilization targets are hard to hit when project timing is unpredictable, you might have people sitting idle waiting for client feedback one week then everyone slammed the next week because three projects kicked off simultaneously. The averages work out over time but individual weeks are chaos. The other issue is skills matching, you might have capacity on paper but it's the wrong skills for current projects. Having 40 available hours of junior developer time doesn't help when you need senior design work, but most resource planning tools just look at raw hours not skill matching.",

Expect a certain amount of waste gone to booking and rebooking.  \n  \nThe other thing is how much context matters to everything. For teams with specialised skills being effective, switching contexts is very expensive and the first sign is a high work-in-progress but lack of delivery. There's a famous graph that points to 20% of cognitive capacity that gets lost per every extra context that an expert switches between.  The trick to succeeding here is start less and finish more.\n\nFinancially an agency tries to optimise for minimum bench time so that money isn't \"wasted\" on things that don't generate revenue. But for client outcomes, the key thing to optimise is team-time-in-context (a better version of \"time-on-task\").\n\nIf the agency optimises for the first, they see their pipeline of incoming work dry up as dissatisfied clients go elsewhere. Some of that pipeline can involve months and years of business development evaporating. If the agency optimises for the second, it can appear to be haemorrhaging wages. \n\nAgencies have been trying to tackle this tension between competing objectives for their entire existence. I've never seen anyone continue to get an optimal result with zero waste.\n\n",
