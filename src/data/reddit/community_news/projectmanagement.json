Of course you need somehow experience in the field you work for if you dont wanna look like an idiot answering basic industry questions with an unrelated topic. But once you know an industry, becoming a PM comes naturally if you are good at planning, taking accountability and manage people and their interests.\n\nSo like in ratatouille, not everyone will be a great PM, but a great PM can come from everywhere.

It wasn’t until well into my 30s that I accepted there was something my leaders consistently saw in me that I hadn’t yet learned to see in myself.\n\nToday, I’m a project manager in the defense industry after spending most of my career as a field-level technician and in regional management roles. I was recruited into my first, and current, PM role by our prime contract holder to manage the very programs I had worked under for three years. I don’t have a college degree, but I do have decades of experience in my field, much of it in leadership positions. I'm currently surrounded by team members that have graduate level degrees and many years of PM experience. I have neither and I could let those delinators cloud my self reflection or I can put my head down, emulate those around me that I respect, and do my best which has almost always been good enough to succeed.\n\nThe most important lesson I’ve learned is that I have very little to lose by “faking it,” because most people are stumbling their way through their jobs anyway. What separates those who get tapped for leadership roles is a willingness to figure things out, an aptitude for learning, and the creativity to try new approaches when the first solution doesn’t work.\n\nWhen you look around at your team, it’s usually clear who wants more responsibility and who truly cares about the deliverable. Time and again, I’ve seen the person who shows up on time, does the work they’re supposed to do, and consistently delivers results earn the promotion. I’ve learned to be that person.

Started as a temp but just kept doing more and more organizey things as I got new jobs til it was officially part of my title. \n\nI think it went: some tech and internet stuff when I was in school, then office temp, office admin (at a college), web and comms job, unemployed web/comms freelancing (ugh), consultant related to what I was doing in grad school, then PM job. Then product manager! I am great at what I do but I don’t look great on paper compared to “real” PMs, I think, since I just learned along the way. At least, I’m guessing that’s a small part of why it’s been hard to find work right now.",

That company made me redundant in 2024 and I was desirable enough to be picked up without any certifications by a public sector organisation within 2 weeks of finishing. \n\nI’ve been at my org now almost 2 years and now have two certifications; my first year I did agilePM and last year I did Prince2. I feel like an imposter almost every single working day of my life despite a decade of experience because I got here in a strange way. My teammates in the PMO all have far more formal experience than my “whatever works” approach, but I’m deployed onto things as a fixer and they’re put onto large scale, multiple workstream, huge pieces of work.

With all of the changes and I only having a last few weeks at this company, it is a little bit weird to be part of conversations on meetings where I am the subject matter expert and almost like transferring the knowledge over as I have been working on it the last few years.

Typically, my project was Project (Server/Online) and working to improve the use of Project by the client’s PM team, or implementation of Project Server/Online. \n\nMy last contract role was with a large insurance company. I had done the implementation and was training and mentoring the users based on their process. They got a new PMO leader who called me in and said “I am not sure I see the value in this” and I replied “Because you are not using it right.” \n\nShe rightfully challenged with “Isn’t that your job?” And of course it was, but when gathering requirements, I am told to go in one direction or another and even if I say ‘that’s not best practice’ or ‘you won’t get full benefit from the tool’ in the end I do it the way they say to. \n\nSo we reconfigured and I did some more training and it was better. Then I was invited to go to a big conference in Idaho and present and my contract was extended 90 days and I was asked if I would consider a full time role. \n\nAt the end of 90 days nothing happened and the manager I reported to told me he didn’t think they were going to extend again. \n\nLiterally while having that discussion I saw a call coming in. I let it roll to VM. \n\nLater I listened to the message and called the guy back. He was a recruiter for Microsoft. The first question I asked was “Is this an orange badge (contract) or blue badge (FTE) position.” \n\nIt was an FTE position and I went through most of the Microsoft 5 step process and started. After about 15 years of working for Microsoft Gold Partners, working for the mothership was a big step up.",

If you have three status meetings a week, think about the preparation and follow up that can maximise the value you bring. Project management is more than collecting updates; it’s about spotting risks early, managing issues before they escalate, and making sure stakeholders get clear, timely communication.\n\nMy advice would be to look at the value you’re already providing and then use the quieter time to strengthen it: improve the quality of your reports, anticipate blockers, tidy up plans, or proactively update stakeholders.",

      "text": "Agile focuses on short-term execution but often loses sight of where we actually want to get. \"We'll figure it out along the way.\" And the agile mindset rarely extends to budget and timeline, just scope.\n\nWaterfall is the opposite problem: everything is fixated on documents written months ago. Every deviation becomes a change request. Reality moves, but the plan most often doesn't.\n\nBoth lead to the same place: you either lack the big picture or you're fighting to keep it alive.\n\nAfter many years as a project manager across both agile and waterfall environments, I keep running into this issue. So I started thinking about what could solve this.\n\nThe idea: treat your project context, the sum of all valid project information, as a living single source of truth. Think of it like a git repository, but for project information instead of code.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\n* External signals (client emails, meeting decisions, new requirements) get broken down into small, concrete updates before merging into the context\n* A human project manager / gatekeeper decides what gets merged, no auto-pilot\n* Every change explicitly shows its effect on time, budget, and scope together, no hiding behind one dimension\n* All stakeholders work from the same basis, breaking silo perspectives\n* AI can support with what-if scenarios, forecasting, and preparing updates, but the human decides\n\n**Example:** Vendor emails API will be 2 weeks late. This gets broken down into: +14 days on Milestone 3, +15k budget, option A (cut feature) or B (extend timeline). Visible before the next standup.\n\nThis is essentially what I call context-driven project management: it solves stale plans from Waterfall, limited view from Agile.\n\n**What's your current approach to keeping project context alive between planning cycles?**",

I said okay, let’s work together to make a discrete plan. “No, I need opportunities for change”. Okay no biggie, let’s do the Agile thing and we can iteratively change things. “No, the ceremonies are stupid.” So now, we have a team that wants no plan/predictability for customers but also no constant communication, too. \n\nIn the end, I’ve noticed the best practice is to focus on the basics: delivery and communication. Then master fundamentals. Not as an attack, but Agile still has predictable long term solutions, and Waterfall can be a bit more rapid to response than you describe.

This brings us to create work systems that are suited to the needs and anxieties of Stakeholders and PMs, not of the actual people doing the work. \n\nThis is what led to the creation of Agile, where the intent was TO IMPROVE team efficacy by focusing on clarity over process, on the right goals that brought real value and on environment changes.\n\nAgile is about leadership and constant improvement, not 2 week sprints without plans.\n\nHaving said that, in order to set clear expectations with everyone involved in the project and understand the context in which it happens I use these six parameters: \n\n- Innovation needed \n- Uncertainty of the outcome\n- Rate of change\n- Cost of change \n- Controllability of the environment (how much the market/regulations/whatever is expected to change)\n- Impact of failure\n\nThe first three tells you if you're in the Discovery phase, while the last 3 tells you if you're in the execution phase. \n\nBy using these, I've been able to negotiate more realistic goals and timelines and create better processes overall since they allow you, and most importantly stakeholders, on what the context of the project really is and what is needed to deliver value.",

          "text": "I don't agree that \"Agile focuses on short-term execution but often loses sight of where we actually want to get.\" Maybe implementations do, but agile methods themselves don't. [Scrum](https://scrumguides.org/) is an Agile method - the Product Goal is where we want to get, and [Evidence-Based Management](https://www.scrum.org/resources/evidence-based-management) pairs nicely with Scrum to add vision and mission statements and a Strategic Goal. [DSDM](https://www.agilebusiness.org/dsdm-project-framework.html) is another Agile method - the Business Visionary and Technical Coordinator roles exist explicitly to keep the focus on the project or product vision and ensure that the architecture supports it. The inability to focus on the long term while taking short-term steps is not a failing of agile, but of how organizations become agile.\n\nBut it's also important to recognize that it's not a binary choice between agile and waterfall. I wouldn't even use \"agile\" for the name of one end of that spectrum. The PMI uses \"adaptive\" and \"predictive\" as the ends, which seem like reasonable names. The question is how much adaptivity or predictability makes sense for your context. Every context is different - some can plan for many months ahead, and only the most drastic events will invalidate those plans, while others have so much uncertainty and ambiguity that planning more than a few days is wasteful.\n\nThe challenge is determining your planning horizon, given the risks, assumptions, and ambiguities. Even within your planning horizon, the level of uncertainty affects how much you can plan up front versus how much you can plan iteratively or incrementally, and stakeholder involvement determines how frequently you can synchronize and reevaluate your plans. But this is how I keep the context alive - carefully considering how long the team can dive into their work before resurfacing to sync with stakeholders.",

Just breathe 2. Remember no one is going to die in a ditch over a project (unless it's you putting them in one) 3. Go back to project management 101 principles of time, cost and scope. \n\nGo back and ensure the business case is fit for purpose, if you don't have a proper business case then ensure one is developed but here is the key ensure your executive has approved it. Saying \"we want to upgrade\" is not a business case, a business case is required to ensure they understand the business value and describing its purpose of implementing and how the project will generate it's value. \n\nThen start with your technical requirements, user requirements and business workflows (conduct your 1:1 meetings, workshops, requirement gathering work groups etc.) and map those to a design and the key here again, have the executive sign and approve the requirements.  Focus on roles and responsibilities along with accountability, if the organisation can't provide the information you need then your project board or executive carry the risk of not reaching benefits realisation and end up in project failure.  Not being a PM, you need to follow this principle workflow because if you don't you're being set up to fail but as the \"responsible person\" it's the path that you need to take to avoid a shit show and get out of the quicksand requirements. Hold people accountable or push back, those are the choices you have and if you don't you will be held as the scapegoat at the end of a failed project. \n\nHere is the reality, if you can't get the requirements and design approved then you need to keep on pushing out the end date of delivery, or you place the risk at the feet of your executive to except. You as the default PM need to provide the clarity needed in order to make the decisions needed and the only way you can do that is develop the design and requirements mapping as your primary focus because you need a clear plan and have it approved. Good luck \n\nJust an armchair perspective \n\n",

Someone has to name the tradeoffs, or the work never converges.\n\nWhat usually helps in situations like this is not another technical plan, but a reset of expectations. A clear articulation of phases, what questions can only be answered later, and what decisions are intentionally deferred. Without that, every new initiative will keep reentering the conversation and reshaping the scope.\n\nYou are not wrong to feel frustrated. You are being asked to build forward while the target keeps moving. That is not a failure of execution. It is a failure of alignment.",

At the start of this year, my company put me on this account because of my performance, and I was excited about the opportunity.\n\nBut little did I know the revisions would be endless. Since January, the client has been requesting round after round of changes—many of which contradict previous feedback or go beyond the original scope we agreed on. I've been working 9+ hours each day trying to keep up, and I've started experiencing stomachaches and gastritis from the stress.\n\nMy company really wants to maintain a long-term relationship with this client, so I feel like I have to act like a doormat and just take it. I'm terrified to bring this up with the client because I'm afraid I'll get emotional or even break down during the conversation. I don't want to jeopardize the partnership, but I also feel like I'm being taken advantage of.\n\nHow can I professionally tell the client that the revisions have exceeded the original scope?

Think of it like revisions or releases. \n\nOne method is to have your leadership team agree to your method, before approaching your client with this.  Then take your client and indicate that you will package up their requests, and for X period of time, you will work on these. Complete them, and then have another session with them, gather more of their next batch of requests, and then complete those.  That will allow you to manage your workload (work/life balance), and provide a consistent and quality output.  \n\nAlso if you think the scope is being exceeded, then you need to refer back to the original Statement of Work, or Signed off requirements to identify such.  Again, have the conversation with your leadership team about this.  Giving away free work sets a bad precedent.  Moving forward, that client and potentially other clients will know that they can push the bounds of any signed/agreed requirements and start asking for the moon.  \n\nThis becomes less about you 'handling' it, and more about putting a process in place and following the rigor of that process.

If one constraint of time, cost or scope changes then the other two must change.\n\nAll you need to say to the client is that \"I'm happy to help with this scope change and the impact of this change will see your project take longer to deliver and it will cost more\".  It pushes back on to the client to see how serious they are about the change as It becomes a litmus to test to see if the client balks at the fact it's going to take longer and cost more.  When the client tries to vary the conversation around any type of change just refer back to the triple constraint because it's a causal effect model. You also have to have a frank conversation about the project's project plan and especially if it's an approved and has been baselined and if in the current situation it's effectively allowing scope creep to occur and contractually the client is exceeding the agreed scope of the contract which raises another whole ball game of conversation around what is legally binding for those variations from everything from support, design, licensing etc. But also how it impacts your organisation's ability to service other clients because the workforce planning model is constantly changing (but that is your executive's problem but it's something that should be in the back of your mind with situations like this.\n\nYou need to seriously consider escalating internally with your project manager and project board or executive about the scope creep problem because it has contractual and legal obligations but it's also heightens your organisation's reputational risk. Then if your executive choose to allow the client's behaviour go unchecked (their choice) then you need to ask for administration support or you will run the risk of burnout. Again highlight the risk and impact of choice!\n\nThis is about you understanding that you need to be having professional and sometimes difficult conversations about fact and impact of choices and the associated risks. Without putting too much of a spin on this you need to put yourself in a proactive position rather than being passive because your fear is leading you where it shouldn't, you need the confidence to point out the facts and it's why we have a project plan, it's a legally binding plan and contract of who, what, when and how and all you're doing is enforcing that plan. The only last thought around this is that your client also knows you're a soft touch and you're actually being bullied or rough ridden into scope creep without you even realizing it, just some reflection points for your consideration and good luck, I hope it works out for you.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

          "text": "4 tips:\n\n1. Understand what you want from the conversation / presentation.  Approval to do something?  Decision on something?  Inform them on something?  Showcase your own success?  Frame the conversation / presentation to achieve that objective - if you need a decision, get to that point quite early.\n\n2. Conclusion first, explanation after.  Tell them the conclusion first - they may not have time or attention to hear your lengthy argument and logic.  They can assign someone else to check your work later, or just trust you.  The worst situation is when you carefully explain your logic and argument, then the audience unexpectedly has to cut the meeting short and walk out before you got to your conclusion (or someone talks too much and drags it out, and you run out of time before the conclusion).\n\n3. Focus on the positives.  A C-level told me to my face: \"We spend all day listening to problems, I don't want to hear every problem you have as well.\"  So, focus on your positives and successes.  Construct it as a shit sandwich - good news first, put the bad news in the middle, then end with more good news.  Don't hide the bad news, risks, issues, but don't make that the focus of your presentation.\n\nLooping back to the first point, consider what you want to achieve with presenting the bad news - just informing them, covering your ass, asking for approval to do something, asking for decision to do something.  If it's just informing them, keep it crisp and clear and don't let it take too much time.\n\n4. Execs like to show their success to others.  Create your presentation in a way that Execs can forward to others showcasing success, even if it is a shit sandwich.  Add some context in appendix for outsiders to better understand the project.  Place your name prominently on the first slide.  When your Exec forwards your presentation to other execs, in order to showcase \"his\" success in \"his\" project, some of the glory also drips down on you.",

There is nothing wrong in asking questions, what is wrong is when you don't and it bites you in the behind, that is when you do look inexperienced and as they say there are no stupid questions!  This is purely a confidence thing and a good project practitioner pushes through their comfort zone in order to successfully deliver their projects.\n\nI would also suggest seeking out two mentors firstly a senior project or program manager (and not your immediate manager) and the other is seeking out an executive to help you develop your business acumen (business savvy).\n\nWhen communicating with the c-suite, it needs to be short, concise and to the point and ensure that you communicate in what you need from them. Bullet points is your friend but think in terms of current problem, impact and what do you need from them, simple.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

      "text": "A year ago I started a PM job in a field where I already had experience (eLearning). It has been the most demoralizing, frustrating, and disappointing experience of my life. \n\nI went into the role with a promise of \"we need solutions! We need someone to take charge! We need something that will help us not lose track of deadlines and projects and let us focus!\"\n\nWhat I got was \"we don't want to use that software. Don't send new emails, only reply to emails. Don't tell us about new processes, you can only suggest them and then we will decide. Also, here is an extremely detailed email of all the things I want you to type into this document that we all have access to.\"\n\nI went into for projects, and I got operations.\n\nSo, I am looking for a new job, but this basically derailed my learning, my career trajectory, and my personal life for the past year. The worst part is that when I was tapped for projects outside of my department, I am praised as a savior, saint, guru, etc (a little hyperbolic but just to prove the point.) Inside my department, I can't even present information with a full thought before being interrupted, questioned, and dismissed.\n\nAnd yesterday, my title was changed from Project Manager to Projects Coordinator, which I actually agree with in terms of what they want for the role, but it's not what I was hired to do.\n\nHow on earth do I a) grow from this and b) get out and into something new without saying \"it was an absolute shit show.\"",

You could be killing it with almost everyone, but piss off the wrong exec and you're on a PIP.

The reason for the change is to grow as a project practitioner because project management is a very broad discipline and there is just not one way to deliver a project and the only way you get experience is by changing your roles in order to develop your delivery style. The thing you need to consider is that you need to change about every two years because after that it's hard to implement change but you're also pickup bad organisational behaviour as well. \n\nI would also suggest joining a professional membership such as Prince2 or PMI in your local chapter, as it will give you access to resources and potential opportunities. I would also suggest doing a goals plan for the next 1,3 & 5 years as that becomes your roadmap on what you need to do in order to achieve your goals. Seek out a mentors as well, not just in project management but also someone from the executive to help build your business acumen (business savvy). \n\nIt took me a long time to get to this understanding, at the end of the day all employers are the same and will always look out from themselves and not consider your career, what it all really comes down to is what are you willing to put up with. Just a reflection point for your consideration, you need to not focus on your title because the term and definition changes at every organisation, you're a project practitioner regardless of your title. \n\nJust an armchair perspective ",

I am an individual with AuDHD who has gotten through life by basically never having a plan of any sort. Every time I've tried to plan something it has gone horribly. Whether its an event or something else. The honest answer is that I avoid it because I feel pretty much incompetant at it every time. Throughout my whole life, whenever I tried to do a thing that wasn't pretty much laid out or obvious, I'd crash almost immediately into a wall of anxiety.\n\nNever planning or really managing my time got me through uni and the first few years of work as a software dev. Now I'm being asked to do bigger, ambiguous projects as the lead... and I'm utterly lost. I have no intuition for any of it. I can't plan anything out, or when I do manage to get something down I can't connect on how to actually execute it. I certainly never, ever feel any sort of confidence in it.\n\nI'm newly medicated, which honestly is how I'm making this post I think, but I think I recognize a fundamental and deep skills gap that I never developed as an individual in or adjacent to project management. I want to develop this skill, in fact its been a top goal of mine for a damn long time. I've tried a lot of different things and methods, none of which involve just buying or doing a course. I'm looking now at the google project management course, but the very first video in the course babbles on about how he has a very natural inclination to project management, which seems to be the antithesis of what I want. I want something that makes no assumptions about my ability to plan and assumes I'm a new born baby.\n\nSo I'm here looking for advice. I don't want to be a project manager as a profession, but I want the ability to manage projects whether that be for work, my own projects, events, whatever else. How can I learn this skill?",

Some of us internalize it early, and some of us never get shown how.\n\nStop trying to plan the whole thing. Your only job is to identify the next smallest step that reduces uncertainty. Planning is translation, not prediction. You are turning confusion into visible pieces not forecasting the future. write plans as questions instead of tasks. What do we need to know next? is often enough to move forward. Can’t stress this enough externalize everything. If it stays in your head, anxiety wins. Messy notes are fine as long as you can read them or make sense if it. 😂 Execution comes from structure not confidence.

That took deliberate planning and coordination.\n\nNow scale that down and you get basic stuff like doing laundry, keeping your house clean and cooking.\n\nScale it up and add hundreds of people with suits and jumpers with a lot writeups and meetings - you get an enterprise software development project.\n\nAt the end of the day, project management is about breaking down a single goal into multiple taskable steps within a constrained budget(days & dollars).\n\nI believe any intelligent person is capable of thriving in this role. \n\nWith the way you have written down and articulated yourself , its clear that you are an intelligent person as well.\n\nSo jump right into, youll be able to manage it.\n\n\nNote : A senior project manager (20 years) told me that our role is not project management but Expectation Management. If you can manage expectations all the time, your project is successful.",

          "text": "This might sounds super basic so I hope this doesn’t come off as insulting, but here is my advice:\n\nStart with a list. Write down everything that you know needs to happen for the project. Then order the list (what happens first, what will happen last, is there something that needs to happen before something else, and so on and so forth). For example to feed your dog: you need to feed the dog, make sure you have dog food, determine how much dog food you need to feed, but you can’t do the tasks in that order. You can’t feed the dog before you have dog food. \n\nOnce you have your list, figure out how long the tasks will take or how long you think they will take. Then figure out who will be responsible for doing the work. If you don’t know right away, that’s okay, but then you’ll need to go and figure it out either by doing some research or asking colleagues. \n\nYou’ll want to schedule meetings with the people involved so you can get their input, make sure they know what their responsibilities are, and share deadlines. Then as time goes on you’ll have more meetings (or conversations) with them to make sure they are doing their tasks and hitting deadlines. \n\nDepending on your organization, you might hear terms like waterfall, agile, standups, sprints. Those all refer to different project management methodologies and tools. You might want to talk to your boss and ask about your organization’s existing processes and talk to colleagues about what has worked for them. \n\nIf you are interested in a crash course, I’d recommend Google’s project management course. It’s not super helpful if you are trying to become a certified PM, but if you’re a newbie just looking to build skills, it’s very approachable and has hands on activities which is helpful if you learn by doing. \n\nGood luck!",

For more deep-dive, the CAPM is a good option.\n\nMaybe take a step back and consider whether you really want to manage people, organise tasks for the team, frequently chair meetings where you request everyone's progress against the plan, their impediment for progress etc. I believe you need to be organised with attention to detail to do this, you need to communicate a lot with people, you need to constantly uncover misunderstandings and facilitate alignment.\n\nA lot of my time goes to \"he said so, but she said something else\", then bring them (reluctantly) together and come to an agreement.\n\nIf you really want to do this, I suggest you work on your soft skills as much as your technical PM skills.",

What is absolutely critical vs like, what’s just nice to have.\n\n100% to what someone else said about externalizing everything and writing everything down. I still have to remind myself to write shit down because if I don’t, there’s a 50/50 chance I forget about it as soon as my brain moves on to something else. \n\nWhen it comes to practicing, don’t be too hard on yourself. Start with a brainstorming session. I like to use post its because you don’t need to commit to any order cause you can just move things around (and it takes some of the pressure off for needing to feel like I’m writing the correct things down in the right order). Keep asking “what do I need to do that.” “Ask an expert/chatgpt/research” is a perfectly fine answer to that question, also. Another thing I’ve found super helpful is being VERY liberal with reminders and alarms. Alexa and I are bffs. Cause like sure I can plan stuff, but remembering to do the things I planned? Yeaaaahhh. I schedule blocks in my calendar sometimes for a specific task so that I offload having to remember to do something to the computer. \n\nBut also the thing with plans is like… they very rarely go perfectly, at least in my experience. Having a flexible mindset and somewhat-flexible contingencies is helpful esp if the project isn’t crazy high stakes. Nobody is going to die and things are not on literal fire? Cool cool. \n\nLinked in learning had had some decent trainings if you have access to that. \n\nSome other practice questions to help hone your skills - you say that every time you’ve tried to plan something, it’s gone horribly. Without blaming yourself - what happened and what kinds of things can you do, or questions you can ask to reduce the odds or impact of it happening again? Like, if your vacation plans were ruined because you showed up and there were no tickets day of, what are things you can do next time ahead of time to avoid this outcome? And if you can’t think of anything, get a boost from chatgpt but don’t let it do all the thinking for you. \n\nOh, and everything always takes longer and is more expensive than you expect, so add in some buffer space.",

So I got creative and started sending out information packages \"about the technology\" being used, essentially it was a disguised 101 guide about the infrastructure being delivered. Was it inconvenient? Yes, extremely but It made my life a lot easier but the thing was that it also helped with the racoon problem, at least I now had a safety on the shot gun.\n\nWhilst it may seem inconvenient at the time you have to ask yourself what is driving the behaviour? Work back from there. If you start educating stakeholders, particularly in project management principles and frameworks as most have a misconception of what it actually is and how it's applied properly, it definitely leads to having better working relationships. Just a reflection point for your consideration.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

DM walk-throughs of earned value concepts and exam style examples that actually make the math click.\n\nPMI also has great resources.\n\nOne tip that helps me is not to try to master finance. Start with how EVM tells a story about performance, then layer in the formulas. Once you see EAC and CPI as signals instead of math problems it gets way easier.

Our conclusion was that these tools felt like overkill for enterprise-level PPM, strong at task and team-level execution, but less compelling when evaluated through an enterprise portfolio lens relative to cost.\n\nThat said, the hype and adoption are hard to ignore, which makes me think there are workflows or contexts where the value is much clearer than what we observed.\n\nFor those who actively use one of these platforms:\n\n\t•\tWhat specific workflows or operating models make the price worth it?\n\n\t•\tAt what team size or organizational maturity does the ROI become clear?\n\n\t•\tAre you using advanced automation, cross-team dependencies, portfolio views, or integrations in ways that materially improve outcomes?\n\n\t•\tWhere do these tools shine and where do they start to feel like overkill or underutilized?\n\nI’m not trying to knock either platform. I’m genuinely interested in understanding where they fit best, and what types of organizations or workflows get the most value relative to the cost.\n\nWould appreciate real-world perspectives, especially from PMs, ops leaders, or portfolio leaders who’ve evaluated or lived with these tools long enough to see both the benefits and the tradeoffs.",

They'll discuss requirements in Slack, make decisions in Slack, change scope in Slack, but won't touch Jira because \"it's too complicated\" or \"I don't have time to learn another tool.\"\n\n\n\nSo we end up with this split brain situation. Engineering uses Jira religiously, business side lives in Slack, and I'm stuck being the bridge between them. Someone asks in Slack \"when is feature X launching\" and I have to go check Jira, then come back to Slack and explain. Stakeholder changes priority in a Slack thread and I have to manually update Jira or the dev team works on the wrong thing.\n\n\n\nThe deadline tracking is especially bad. Stakeholder says \"we need this by end of month\" in a casual Slack message and I'm supposed to somehow make sure that commitment is tracked, communicated to eng, and actually happens. Miss one message and we're off by weeks.\n\n\n\nCan't force stakeholders to use Jira, can't force eng to live in Slack.

Your stakeholders generally shouldn't need to live in Jira--it's primarily an engineering tool.\n\nThe specific problem of changes happening via Slack message is a process problem, not a tool problem. Does your contract institute any change management controls? You're supposed to define scope with stakeholders at the beginning of an effort, initiative, etc., get stakeholder buy in on the scope of work, then put them through ECPs if they want to formalize a change in scope or timeline. \n\nIt sounds like you've made it too easy for stakeholders to run over you. Make a biweekly priorities meeting or create a form to request change in scope/priority/timeline. Say it's so that you can better manage changes, because tracking via Slack isn't good enough, but it's also to increase the barrier for entry for a scope change. If you make it easy for them to change scope, they'll think it's easy to execute a change in scope. You need to formalize the change process so it's not conducted via informal message.",

You as the PM need to set clear expectations of what is required and expected and if you can't get the outputs you need then you have to flag and escalate to your project board/sponsor/executive because not only do you have a IT system and data stores issue (e.g. not fit for purpose) you also have an organisational culture issues compounding the situation.  I also feel that you're being taken advantage and rough ridden with stakeholder non compliance, that is something that needs to be escalated. \n\nTask progress and tracking is your responsibility as the PM and you need to make a single system work, you need to work the stakeholders, their team leads and executive to reach a suitable and attainable outcome.  As an extreme example (and yes it did actually happen) I once had a Dev team who was extremely non compliant (apparently the company revolved around them), After basically refusing to comply with the project reporting requirements I had a project status meeting and clearly outlined how their behaviour impact me to deliver the project but how it raises the organisation's risk profile and then I reiterated my position on expectations and requirements. I also highlighted their behaviour as being unprofessional and outside project and organisational governance models, so repeated non behaviour can and will require HR involvement. \n\nAfter further non compliance I started having ad-hoc and inconvenient mandatory meetings e.g 08:00am, 12:00pm or 5:00pm. Did all hell break loose? Yes and the management team were standing behind me on this one. Did I make friends? No. Did I get what I needed? Yes. Did they comply in the future? Yes.  As a PM you will learn as you become more seasoned is that you can't be everything to everyone, because you need something from them in order to deliver. your project on time, on budget and fit for purpose,  ultimately you need to hold these people accountable. If they're required to use a system or systems (s) to track efforts then that is what is required, and I will ask you this, why do you get to carry the can when it fails and your stakeholders are not doing what is expected or required of them? Just a reflection point for your consideration \n\nJust an armchair perspective. ",

Management is for processes like assembly lines. Leadership is something entirely different.\n\nTo solve this, look for a vision which leads people to use the best tools. Going all gantt horny and \"Herding Cats\" is only asking for endless frustration and failure; for everyone.\n\nYour goal is to get everyone wanting the same clear thing. The executive, the clients, the executive. This way, all conversations can be filtered through this vision. They can ask for changes, etc, and you can say, \"Great idea. I am going to put that into Phase II\"\n\nWhen they asked for it to be in Phase I, I would ask what in Phase I should be moved to Phase II? When they would say, \"Can't you do it all in Phase I? I would ask how much we can now delay Phase I, but their brilliant idea would work very well in Phase II.\n\nThe key is to manage their expectation as to what is going to be done in Phase I.\n\nThen, when Phase II was being planned, they usually had forgotten their stupid idea; or the other people would disagree that it should be done at all. This way, you also avoided a pile of stupid meetings discussing stupid ideas.\n\nThe key here was the project was a creative process and thus leadership is the only way to run this. But, clients are more like a factory. They require a process, and that is something you manage.\n\nThere is no reason for clients to be in Jira outside of reporting bugs. They should have their expectations managed by regular reporting of the progress through reports. If they are pumping new features or alterations through slack on an endless basis, the math will kill you. Any collection of dumbasses given this sort of method for adding or changing features will be able to make demands which far exceed your speed of delivering. \"Hey could you port it to Apple?\" \"Oh, wait, we would like it on my Apple watch as well\". This means that they have not bought into a clear vision of what is going to be built, or when, or how constrained the resources are to do this.\n\nA proper iterative development methodology will definitely have feedback, but controlled by a good leader to more be a refinement of the vision, vs a bunch of micro directives.",

Unfortunately, this person consistently delays the project. In meetings, they make big commitments and speak very confidently, but afterward he would completely disappear for next 24-48 hours, no responses to message or calls. \n\nIf anyone else takes the initiative or moves forward in their absence, he later criticises the work or tries to prove it wrong, resulting in rework and further delays. He has a very high-ego personality, and replacing him isn’t an option because he is the main face to the client and senior management.\n\nI also feel that he may have developed a personal grudge against me, possibly due to frequent follow-ups or escalations when he doesn’t respond. At this point, it’s becoming a nightmare to manage. Even when I guide developers or make decisions to keep things moving, those decisions are later challenged, and more time is lost.\n\nHas anyone dealt with a similar situation? How do you manage a critical stakeholder who blocks progress but cannot be removed? Any practical strategies would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.",

I was constantly involved in ego pissing matches between SME's.\n\nWhen I first started out as a PM I would have these individuals behave in the same manner but when I became a bit more seasoned I started holding them to account and calling out their behaviour with fact. I would suggest the escalation process as follows:\n\n* Informally speak with them 1:1 and use fact to highlight the impact that they have by their behaviour and if you find no resolution then escalate to their team lead. Set your expectation if they are to provide subject matter expertise they are bound to the project schedule and if they fail to meet the agreed date then the matter gets escalated.\n* After the informal conversation with the SME and if the behaviour continues then escalate the matter\n* Whilst the escalation is underway informally speak with the SME's  team lead and provide documented evidence of the behaviour and how it's directly impact your project delivery.\n* If there is no adequate outcome with the team lead then you need to formally escalate it to your project board/sponsor/executive because your triple constraint is constantly being put at risk at the expense of your SME's unprofessional and unacceptable behaviour. Start showing how much time and money is being wasted because of their inability to deliver or playing hardball you start pushing out delivery dates because your triple constraint is being impacted.\n\nAt the end of the day if this individual likes you or not, you shouldn't take it personally, all it shows is how unprofessional and insecure they are as an individual.  Drive home your triple constraint and if they impede the delivery of your triple constraint then call the behaviour out and let the team lead, project board, executive or worse case scenario HR deal with the issue. It's not a project problem, it's a culture issue and that lies with your executive.\n\nBy using documented facts and evidence it's hard for the SME to take it personally because it's their action that is being highlighted and it can't come back at you because all you do is point to the facts and leave it at that.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

I don't know what works best in your organization, but log the things and timestamps of when they are handed over to this person and when they are reviewed and complete.

      "text": "I switched from my role in communications with a broad team to being a PM with a smaller team because I absolutely loved the people and their mission. Plus, my communications team had become quite toxic, and I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nThis is my first time as an official PM. I was put in charge of business operations/admin projects. It's hard because so many examples in trainings are focused on technical projects. And most of what I do feels like I'm not even the administrative assistant or office administrator, I just write down what those people do and mark it done at our weekly meetings. I'm so mind-numbingly bored.\n\nI also manage some \"projects\" like hiring staff. So, I write down the job title we're hiring for and have Asana automated to fill in all the subtasks that get a person hired. Most of these tasks require waiting on HR or procurement teams with whom I have no communication, so we have a weekly meeting with leadership where they tell me the status of the roles we're hiring for. They hardly ever come. And recently, we've been on a hiring freeze requiring leadership to write justifications for their positions, so that call had become more about tracking those justifications, something I'm also not in direct communication with those above us about and need people to tell me what happened, so I can merely mark it off in Asana, a spreadsheet now, and a PPT that our director wanted for tracking for some reason. Recently? I was given the feedback that leadership doesn't feel like the hiring calls are helpful or productive or something, and the only advice I was given from our program manager is that they need to know the impact of how long the hiring process is taking on their projects. He was pointing at the dates in Asana. So, I just said, \"So, they just want me to read the due dates? Okay.\" My response was a little clipped. I kept having to swallow my frustration and try not to appear like I had a bad attitude, but I know it probably came through. \n\nMy boss then told me he wanted me to watch trainings on Udemy on project management. I told him I would but those usually give the examples of technical projects and mine feel more non-traditional (his words in the past). I understand what project management should be. This just feels like it isn't it. What can I do or say to make this better? Is this a normal situation for a PM? I only want to keep my job because it pays my rent and jobs are hard to come by, but I don't know if I can handle how pointless I feel much longer. Thanks for any advice.",

Daily, twice a week, whatever makes sense for the volume of work. Proactively gather their updates and build a relationship with that team.\n\nTry to streamline and increase visibility into the process - see if you can bring the HR team over to Asana for this process. Use an Asana board as an easy visual tracking tool. You create the backlog of tasks, they can assign themselves and move the cards to through the various steps until completion. Give leadership read access to the board so they can check in at any time to see the status of each hire.\n\nManagement doesn't like meetings? Send out a weekly status email instead with very clear calls to action to unblock workflows. Put the \"currently blocked\" section at the top of the email. Blockers would usually be management approvals or actions (justifications), things you wouldn't be able to help alleviate by working with the HR team in the standing meeting. Nicely putting leaders on blast in a group email can spur them to take action so they don't look like the bottleneck. You don't have to think of it as blaming or calling people out, just stating the facts of next steps for the workflow.\n\nPut some focus on timelines since your boss recommended that. Work it into your email, maybe a column for days since opening and a green/yellow/red highlight to whether things are on track.\n\nTo make sure you're not going way outside your bounds and getting yourself fired, you can collaborate with your boss to adjust language/tone and make sure you're accomplishing what you need to with the email.",

The projects I've been assigned to \"wrangle\" or \"organize\" that \"require an Asana project\" just sit there with myself as the only user. I've learned to spot these ahead of time because those types of projects usually just need a document of a project plan with milestones that can be used as checkpoints. Asana is great for large or cross-functional projects where you can use things like multihoming and AI summaries of weekly activities. Otherwise, it may be overkill for the actual work that your department does and a good set of Excel and Word templates can suffice. \n\nThe other thing I had to do around my transition time from comms to PM is pivot to creating/documenting the operational processes overall when I didn't have other meaningful work to do. It helped me wrap my brain around how the department should work collaboratively on the operational level, and my PM skills then were flexed to influence functional change.\n\nI will say that I was not really ever authorized to take charge on this stuff (an org should have a PM at the table as a strategic partner, otherwise, you're an admin or a coordinator/traffic manager). I step up where I see a leadership void or ambiguity and work to create frameworks and processes. Basically, I just do it, and ask forgiveness later, always with the view of supporting the overall mission and leaving it better than I found it. I've only gotten told that I've overstepped maybe twice in 3 years, and they're otherwise happy that I've contributed to the overall department to make it work better.",
