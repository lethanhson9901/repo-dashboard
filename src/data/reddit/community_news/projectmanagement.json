I would basically have a small project bible that had a page of budget/cashflow figures, minutes from key meetings, decision/action log, change control log, and other key stuff relevant at that point in time. It would need updating at least once a week, maybe more.

The inputs are better than they've ever been atleast for the most part.\n\nStill I keep hitting the same wall I have hit in most aspects of my roles. Someone senior has already decided what the quarter looks like and the data doesn't really matter at that point.I'm trying to sort out what data or insights would drive meaningful prioritization decisions.\n\nSo I'm starting to wonder if the whole \"be more data driven\" thing is just something we tell ourselves to feel better about a process that's actually just politics and whoever talked to the CEO last.\n\nWould love to be proved me wrong.

If they choose not to follow your advice or guidance regardless of it be political or them being clueless, then that is on them; In which you can clearly show through your IT systems,  decision, issues and risk logs of business transactions that have occurred (or in a crude way of putting it, you have just covered your behind). \n\nIf you're documenting accordingly, particularly with decision making and the ownership of that, you have been diligent in your role as the PM (again, rightly or wrongly) but it's not your responsibility because your project board/sponsor/executive is ultimately responsible for the success of the project, as the project manager you're responsible for the day to day business transactions and the delivery quality of your project.

A lot of “be data driven” really means “bring data that supports the direction we already like.”\n\nThe only time I’ve seen data actually change leadership’s mind is when it stops being abstract and starts becoming operationally painful.\n\nWe had a case like that around safety spend. Leadership wanted to trim part of the budget because on paper it looked like overhead. But we had enough structured reporting and follow-up history to show that the stuff they wanted to cut was tied directly to repeat issues, slow closeouts, and rising exposure in the field. Once it became “cut this and here’s the likely downstream hit,” the conversation changed fast.\n\nSo I’d say data works best when it’s tied to consequences leadership actually feels. If it stays as insight, politics wins. If it becomes risk with a price tag, people suddenly get very interested. Have to hit them where it hurts as to say.",

Of course, the specific idea may change directions a bit. But let’s say you report to a manager who’s below a director and you heard a speech or read an email from the CEO. There will be a request about implementing topic X or integrating topic X eventually. If you’re able to get a plan or story together through the data before your manager receives their directive, you’re in a great position to influence their decisions\n\nIn my previous company, C levels were considered the ultimate authorities so everyone tried to do what they want.

What you're getting is a single perspective from an individual that has had experience which may be very different from your own current situation.  I've seen some of my mentoree's try and follow a principle or approach of where they read something and thinking it was right but couldn't actually understand why their approach was failing. \n\nThe other thing to consider as a PM you just don't use a single discipline, experienced and more seasoned PM use numerous disciplines and principles such as finance, HR, contracts, procurement, change management, quality assurance management, operational management, subject matter expertise and the most important two disciplines is Emotional Quotient (EQ) or people soft skills and strategic positioning.  You have to understand these disciplines and master them with the more complex projects and programs that you undertake in the future. People in this thread will offer you suggestions because it was something that they have come across and resonated with them but if you find something which resonates, great then try it but also if it doesn't work then drop it. Don't keep on trying and hoping for a different outcome because that is the definition of insanity and it's amazing to see PM's consistently making the same mistakes. \n\nWhilst I'm not saying not to read but just to highlight the point that there is also no silver bullet to put you on the fast track to be a great practitioner, the only thing that does is practical experience. Also overtime as an experienced practitioner you will learn what doesn't and does work for you as your confidence and experience grows and your style emerges.  In short, take what ever you read and find out what does or doesn't work for you but also take it with a grain of salt because it's an individual's perspective and nothing more and don't fall into the trap thinking it's gospel or the only way to do things. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.

Not the technically complex work in the middle of the project.\n\nThe last 20%.\n\nBy the time a crew is in final cleanup, something invisible has already happened. The mental finish line moved. Guys who followed procedure perfectly for three months start cutting corners they wouldn't have touched in week two. Inspectors who caught everything start catching less. The standard that held all winter quietly drops - not because anyone decided to lower it, but because everyone's brain already handed in its resignation.\n\nI've watched it happen on every long project I've ever run.\n\nThe cold and the hard work don't break the system. Anticipation does.\n\nWhen people can see the end, they stop running the process that got them there. Fatigue is real - minus 40, camp food for three months, boots so muddy they weigh twice what they should. But the incidents in the final stretch aren't just fatigue incidents. They're attention incidents. The brain stops scanning for what could go wrong because it's already planning the drive home.\n\nThe fix isn't more safety meetings in the final week. It's understanding that the last 20% needs more system, not less - precisely because everyone's instinct is to run less of it.\n\nDesign your end-of-project protocols the same way you designed your startup protocols. Because the job isn't done until it's done.\n\nAre we designing our systems to hold through the finish line, or just to the point where everyone stops paying attention?\n\nFor those who've been there - what did the last 20% actually look like on your worst project?",

It’s frustrating when companies say they want project management expertise and then insist the PM just follow “processes” developed by non-PMs before they realized they needed to hire a PM. It’s a catch 22 and it costs the company a TON of money.\n\nEdit: thought of another.

It was this unspoken thing where you could literally predict who was next. The plaque went on the wall and nobody ever looked at it, including the person who got it. Meaningless.\n\nHoliday gifts. Same item for all 30 people every December. One year it was mugs. I watched people open them at the party and leave them on the table. Not even take them home. Just abandon mugs in a conference room. That image lives rent free in my head.\n\nQuarterly surveys asking what people wanted, then ordering whatever was cheapest or easiest regardless of the responses. I asked for input I had no intention of using. That's worse than not asking at all because now people feel like their opinion doesn't matter AND they got something they didn't want.\n\nEverything was on a schedule. Q1 recognition, Q2 recognition, etc. Nothing was ever tied to something someone actually did. Just calendar dates that triggered an obligation.\n\nWhat I do now is completely different. Recognition happens when it happens, not on a schedule. People pick their own stuff through our shop on swaggy so nothing ends up abandoned on a table. I send a code with a note about what they specifically did that mattered. The specificity is the part that actually makes people feel seen.\n\nLook, none of this is revolutionary. But it took me three years of watching people politely pretend to be grateful before I figured it out. Maybe skip that part.",

I remember I was very anxious during my first client presentation.\nHere are some tips that could help you \n- do box breathing before the meeting , drink a few sips of water , try to take a walk if you can or listen to your fav song before the meeting\n- prepare well in advance / practice before mirror/ it's okay to pause during présentations to refer notes. It's okay to say - I will come back to you after the meeting if you don't know the answer.\n- make sure to Include all key numbers / points in the slides you are  presenting so that you don't forget - this reduces the fear of getting struck or forgetting \n- they are normal people who also started as juniors - you are here to deliver the key messages and you will improve with experience \n- Also there are free YouTube videos that provide strategies for improving  communication & presentation skills \n\nIf you feel anxious during all of your daily tasks - you should check your blood panels.",

      "text": "I am mechanical engineer currently \"leading\" the project as the engineering lead and the project manager. I have been trying to learn the ins and outs of managing a project and how to do it effectively. From running this project as my first major NPD project, I am a newfound respect for project management and how it is a very difficult thing to do.\n\n  \nAny who I am running into this problem of my weekly stand-up meeting getting \"hijacked\" by people. Today my bosses boss decided to sit in on our meeting. He heard something that he didn't agree with and went off on a 30-minute tangent that was not adding any value to our meeting or discussion. He forced me to go through various ERP screens to find an answer he was looking for, then proceeded to tell me I should know this process better (even though he didn't know it as well as he thought). Then at the final minutes of the meeting he decided to go on another tangent and the meeting ended up lasting an additional hour. Not sure the best way to tell a director that he is getting us off task?\n\n  \nAnother example is another engineer who is working on the project. He has been a great recourse but is very fixated on certain things. He works in R&D (actually is the lab manager) and does not really care about the timeline at all. He also doesn't care much for following standard processes. So, he constant brings up things that are not big issues and could easily be addressed post launch and are not showstoppers. He often interrupts me and won't let things go. My boss is aware of this and doesn't do much to back me up or put an end of things. So again, a person who is technically above me at a manager level that I can't really tell to buzz off...\n\n  \nI would love any advice a seasoned project manager could give me!",

This means you need to tell people when they get off topic, or are hijacking the meeting. \n\nMake sure your meeting has an agenda where **at the end** you leave time for a bit of open discussion. \n\nIf you veer off topic, cut the individual off immediately. This is the uncomfortable part. You need to explain “this is off topic for the meeting and if we have time at the end I can help you set up your own meeting to address that”. \n\nKeep it professional and take repeat offenders aside and directly tell them they cannot continue attending the meetings if they don’t follow protocol. Follow this directive up to them in an email. Cc their boss if you feel it needs the escalation. \n\nYou will very quickly build a reputation as a no nonsense meeting guide. This is a good thing in that your meeting will track, but also you may. E asked to run other meetings.",

          "text": "lol. Welcome to the fun!\n\nI’ll get to your boss’ boss in a minute.  Let me start with general advice, then your colleague, and then get to him.\n\nSo, generally, it’s a best practice to send the meeting agenda in advance.  You can include it in the meeting invite. It helps people prepare, and gives you something to point to if people get off track.  Then, at the start of the meeting, you can review the agenda and ask if anyone has any concerns/questions about the planned agenda.\n\nFrom there, it really gets into soft skills as well as technical knowledge. If someone takes the conversation in a different direction, I will usually let them go for a minute or two, then (sometimes rudely) jump in and ask if the conversation is relevant to the meeting agenda, or if it can be added to the meeting’s “parking lot”, and discussed at the end of the meeting once non-relevant invitees have left. Or, does there need to be a specific meeting about that topic?\n\nSometimes (rarely), someone is bringing up an issue that affects the project and needs to be discussed right then, in which case I’ll: 1. ask if we have right people to discuss it, and try to bring in anyone needed, and 2. promise to reschedule the original meeting once we clear the issue.\n\nFinally, dealing with leaders: you can try to get them to agree to a parking lot, but sometimes they are on a power trip and won’t agree.  In which case, sometimes you have to put up with it, but should discuss it with your boss to see if they have any tips.  Then, of course, reschedule your original call and leave them out ( if you can). \n\nDepending on the personalities involved, you may even schedule a one on one with him to discuss the information he needs to see  how you can get to him without him hijacking your meeting.  \n\nUltimately, however, the most important thing is that the information is getting to the right people at the right time to keep the project moving forward.  You may be able to make up the difference with an email chain or a slack /teams chat instead. \n\nSo, TL:DR:\n\n1. Publish the agenda before\n\n2. Stress the agenda at the start of the meeting, and get agreement from the team\n\n3. Encourage tangents to move to the parking lot, but make sure they do get discussed\n\n4. Escalate problems with your boss, and determine how your boss’ boss can best get the info he needs without hijacking your meetings. ",

So something like 45 mins instead of the typical hour.  When things come up that threaten to hijack the meeting, say that we have a limited time to get through the agenda.  Once projects are really rolling my progress meetings usually take less than 15 mins.  Consultants love me for giving them back time.\n\nAlso when you send out the agenda ahead of time ask if there are any items you missed.   If someone brings something up that isn’t on the agenda table it and give them a call later.\n\nPut action items at the top of your meeting minutes with assignments.  These become the agenda for the next meeting.",

When management wants to get involved in a standup (which should be a quick working meeting), as a PM I would always ask the question: \"what is your objective in attending the meeting?\". That will help you uncover what the leader is looking for and determine if their expectation can be met in another meeting instead. It could also help you uncover something you aren't serving in how you are communicating or managing and that then provides a path that eliminates this behavior. \n\nFor the engineer that has a different definition of \"done\" from the project's level of acceptance, establishing that clarity is likely going to resolve the issue. This could be done a few different ways. First, if a definition of done doesn't exist, try creating one that everyone agrees to. Then this can be referenced if people get fixated on something that goes beyond the idea of \"done\". Another option, is my preferred approach, which is to document success criteria in your project charter and then transfer these to applicable deliverables as \"acceptance criteria\". Clear acceptance criteria on work items can help to curb the behavior as an alternative to a \"definition of done\". This individual's behavior can also be a sign of feeling undervalued, so pay attention to offering kudos where due and to building rapport that shows them you do appreciate their investment and style, even if you object to some of their ideas.",

          "text": "Here is a couple of things to keep in mind with Scope of Work (SOW) creep:\n\n* The amount of change requests in a project is a quality indicator of your business case and or SOW. The more change request you have the more you know that your business case or original SOW is unfit for purpose. So the first question is, does the client really know what they want or is your organisation not engaging properly?\n* Your triple constraint of time, cost and scope becomes your only priority and you only manage the exceptions.  As an example, if I'm to deliver a blue widget (scope) and the client said they now want a blue widget with gold wings (scope change) and because of the triple constraint model that immediately tells you that the time and cost must change. It's a causal and effect model and you need to ask your client which indicator do they want to change because the other two must change. It's a very good way to stop a client's scope creep because as the PM you're pushing the responsibility back on to the client to make a decision in what they want it to change. (It quickly flushes out if they really want the change especially if it's going to cost them or they're just trying it on to get something out of scope for free under the guise of client relationships).\n* As the PM if you allow scope creep in reality you're on the hook for a non/less profitable projects and by allowing scope creep it has flow on effects and not just at the project level, it can effect everything from licensing, support, maintenance, contractual, warranty, operational resources availability and you will earn a reputation very quickly if you keep on throwing dead cats over the fence at the end of your project.\n* Choosing \"when to eat it or not\" is a difficult challenge because there are many variables that need to be taken into consideration but it mostly comes back to two calls (which is generally not made by the PM, it's made by the project board/sponsor/executive) it can be the standard +/- 10-15 % of the total value of the project (generally the profit margin of the project) or the other is an organisational strategic call (treat it as a leader loss for an important client or more work, again not a PM's call).\n* As you become a more experienced practitioner you will become more adept at pushing back on the client, it's about confidence and enforcing your triple constraints, setting and maintaining the client's expectations. Simply put if they keep on changing the requirements you keep pushing out the end dates and costs. The client will come to learn that it's not a free for all and if you have problems then you escalate to your project board/sponsor/executive to make an informed decision.\n* AI has nothing to do with the triple constraints! you need to teach and inform your client, it's a contractual and working relationship not a technology relationship.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

Read the contract / agreement and see if it’s absolutely beyond shadow of a doubt scope creep.\n\nDon’t just “eat it”, document the change, if it’s something you agree to do. \nOr refuse, or documented the new updated scope but with extra cost.\n\nPoint is to make sure it’s agreed with all parties and being transparent of the process.\n\nWhen user sees you explain things clearly and given some insight to the why, they usually appreciate it.",

      "text": "I started a new role as a Project Lead on February 17th. It’s a two pay grade promotion with a solid base salary increase, and I recently earned my PMP, so this felt like a huge career milestone for me.\n\nI’ve been assigned to a large project consolidating five different software systems into one enterprise-wide platform. There are multiple workstreams tied to each system, like HR, finance, reporting, etc. I’m the lead for the finance workstream.\n\nHere’s where it gets tricky.\n\nThe finance workstream technically started about four to six months ago. They were waiting on approval to officially hire and assign project leads to each workstream, which is why I’m just now coming in. Two other new leads will also be starting soon.\n\nThe gentleman who has been running the finance workstream up to this point has never had a project lead. He told me we’ll figure out what “my role” looks like as we go. I understand that some clarity takes time. I’m not expecting everything to be perfectly defined in week one.\n\nBut right now, I’m being treated like an administrative assistant rather than a project lead.\n\nI’m being asked to run Zoom AI Companion during meetings, organize and distribute notes, schedule workshops that are already fully structured with titles, attendees, and homework assignments defined. Basically execution support tasks, not leadership or strategic oversight.\n\nNone of my performance objectives include admin work. They’re focused on delivery, stakeholder alignment, risk management, governance, and outcomes. I worked hard for this promotion and certification. I did not step into this role to manage meeting minutes.\n\nTo add another layer, my direct manager is not part of this project. She already warned me that another project lead on a different workstream is not being utilized appropriately and told me to make sure I escalate if needed. So I know I’m not crazy for sensing this might become a pattern.\n\nOn top of that, the workstream lead has already made it clear he prefers people in the office and isn’t thrilled that I’m home based. That’s not changing. My role is remote eligible and that was part of the agreement.  I’ve worked remote since 2009 and it has never interfered with my performance.\n\nIt’s been a bit of a crushing first week. I’m already feeling anxious about tomorrow, which is not how I expected to feel stepping into a promotion I was excited about.\n\nI’m planning to address role clarity directly in our next meeting and align expectations to my stated objectives, but I want to do it professionally and early before this dynamic sets in permanently.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar, especially stepping into a project midstream where someone has been operating without formal structure? How did you establish authority and role clarity without coming across as territorial or difficult?\n\nWould appreciate any advice.",

When I applied for the PL role, I expected to be declined due to my pay grade, but I have my PMP, which was required, so I took a chance.  It’s not common for employees to be hired for a role two grades above at our company. I was shocked I was picked to interview. I figured it was just to “get the #s” so they could meet candidates criteria and offer to someone else waiting in the pipeline already. So when they contacted to offer the role I was floored - two above my grade = good promotion & increase in pay (not common in our firm at all). \n\nThe person I’m concerned with isn’t being replaced, he is a main stakeholder of six in my matrix team that I will be leading - he is a top leader in finance so he working in the workstream.  He will remain in the workstream in the planning, sprints, and working on the granular technical things I would not customarily be involved in. Yet, I’m being asked to be in all of these meetings to take notes, run zoom, launch AI compaction, send out notes and PowerPoints after meetings… things that an admin would do.  I spoke to another lead (not mentioning what I was being asked to do) and they are deep in strategic transition and planning. I asked if they scheduled all the workshops and what not and she said “nope, that’s nope our scope of work as a lead.” \n\nTrying to be optimistic, but I’m REALLY good at reading people and can figure someone out pretty quickly- and I’m rarely wrong about a person. So I am hesitant knowing my gut is telling me I’m stepping into a role with a strong male personality who seems to be pretty … hate to say- arrogant, and maybe even a bit chauvinistic.  He literally said in a meeting Friday to a young female offshore contractor “looks like you’re ready to go clubbing and be off this call cause you’re all dressed up, unlike your usual” - it was 9p where she was and 9am for us. She didn’t seem enthused by his comment. I felt bad for her. Of course, I don’t know their working relationship, but I could read the zoom room when it was said. \n\nI will def take your advice and try to work backwards to find answers to the points you’ve brought up. I guess he just really rubbed me the wrong way on my first week. Now I’m laying here wide awake worried when I’d usually be asleep two hours by now.",

You're surprised by the promotion; I'd bet this stakeholder would be too - in fact, does this stakeholder even know something has meaningfully changed? Has a conversation been had with them about what your role is, or are you *both* making assumptions? Because probably this stakeholder hasn't thought about this at all, or at least I find that it almost always the case. \n\n\nThe other thing that springs to mind is, what strategic transition and planning needs to be happening that someone one week into the role would be doing instrad of what you are doing now? This is where the transition plan comes in. It takes time to onboard and hand off a project, especially as a leader. \n\n\n>  I’m REALLY good at reading people and can figure someone out pretty quickly- \n\n\nThis is a red flag to me.\n\n\nBut regardless, even if it is true, you can't handle this stakeholder from that point of view. Dismissing or making assumptions or setting your behavior about the stakeholder because of a vibe, even if that is 100% true, is a recipe for failure. Unfortunately, we have to work with shitty people all the time. Put that energy toward figuring out how to work with this person, regardless of whether they suck. One key to that is to figure out where they are coming from and why. \n\n\nBut, for the record, admin work is alert of the job. No, I usually wouldn't do it for a functional team's workshops or what have you, but I still own that work for the project or program's operating rhythm. Explaining the difference is often something j have to do, so best to come up with a script for it now. You'll be using it a lot in your career! ",

There are definitely other factors at play. \n\nConsider culture. If you are in a country where role definitions are extremely explicit and rigidly followed, your husband may have the more appropriate view. \nIn some cultures, it maybe more common to ease an individual into the rule. Your apprehension is understandable, given the possible positive or negative possible consequences in this circumstance. \n\nAt best, I would suggest you to attempt greater responsibilities as much as you can once you understand environment and responsibilities well.",

      "text": "Been going pretty deep on the PSA software category lately and figured this might save someone else some time.\n\nMost of these tools look similar on the surface but they're actually pretty different once you get into how billing works and how complex your operations are.\n\nBQE Core tends to get strong marks for billing accuracy, especially for smaller firms. Very accounting-first. The tradeoff that comes up in reviews is that resource planning and multi-entity setups get clunky at scale.\n\nKantata is genuinely enterprise-grade. The resource and workload planning is where it gets consistent praise. But implementation is a real investment, and that comes up a lot in mid-market evaluations as a concern.\n\nOpenAir makes a lot more sense if you're already a NetSuite shop. If not, that ecosystem dependency becomes its own question to answer before anything else.\n\nScoro gets described in most comparisons as more of a full business ops platform than a pure PSA. Solid if you want CRM baked in, but probably more than you need if billing and project delivery are the core problem.\n\nRuddr is newer and gets solid reviews for UX, especially for smaller consultancies. Less depth on complex billing scenarios from what's out there so far.\n\nBigTime comes up a lot in the context of quote-to-cash (the full flow from proposal to invoice in one place) and the QuickBooks and Sage Intacct integrations get mentioned frequently. There's also a Projector acquisition that expanded the enterprise side of things.\n\nWhat's driving your evaluation? Happy to go deeper on any of these depending on what you're actually trying to solve.",

The only setups that stuck were the ones where tasks could actually be created and updated from inside Slack threads, not just pushed as notifications. Tools like ClickUp and Asana have decent Slack actions, and Linear is pretty smooth if you are more product focused, but it still takes some behavior change. One thing that helped us was making it a rule that any decision made in a thread had to immediately become a task before the convo moved on. Slight friction up front, but it kept the board closer to reality.\n\nHow big is your team? I’ve found the smaller the team, the more realistic it is to stay mostly Slack native without the system breaking down.",

      "text": "Looking for advice on best apprach out of a project thats in chaos. I'll admit I'm partially to blame also due to not standing up to some individuals and allowing scope creep. \n\nSo project started 1 year ago, basically an IT upgrade, hardware procurement, app upgrade and data migration. In that  time 2 board approved changes in scope. All straight forward so far. \n\nScope changes\n 1) addition of preproduction environment. Simple enough just extended schedule and cost\n2) changes in hardware requirements. This is where it gets problematic. One of the board (my line manager and reaponsible for my contract renewal) has used this CR to ram in a pet technology he wants for a new tech without having to go through approvals for it. I missed it (didnt realise the inpact and was told it would take 3 weeks to implement) and the change was approved by the board. \n\nProblem is now we are 6 months late because of this addition of the different tech. Budget is blown because of the unforseen costs of the scope creep and (I'll admit) my failure to account for the costs of the 2 CRs and revise the budget earlier. \n\nNow I need to present to the board and outline the issues, projected costs and path to success (and not get fired)\n\nI'm baffled how to phrase it, maybe I'm too close to the problems. But issues are\n1) poc caused significant delays and cost over run\n2) costs of changes not factored in earlier and budget revised. Now I need to revise the budget and hardware costs have gone up by nearly 200%\n3) uncertainty on when hardware is going to be available. Basically the poc guy manages hardware and he's dragging his behind on deciding soec and saying it ain't my concern. But this project depends on the availability of the hardware and is supposed to fund the price.\n4) person that rammed stuff in is difficult and confrontational. Can't openly pin blame on them as it will become antagonistic \n\nLooking for a way to summarise this and provide a decent path to green and no matter what I write it just doesn't seem to highlight how the scope creep and governance failures  have impacted everything.

          "text": "Firstly, breathe as people don't die in ditches over things like this, but to be honest it's going to get a bit bumpy for a while but seriously keep in mind that it's only a temporary situation. Secondly, the reality is that you have lost control of your project because you've had changes to your approved baselined project but the reality is that you've not administered them due diligently, which should become a very important learning lesson for you.\n\nA suggested approach is to go back to your original business case and start mapping out your project's chronology of events and the changes and the decisions made as the evidence of change and what the impact that it had over your original baselined project. I would also suggest that you propose or recommend to your project board/sponsor/executive to placing the project on a momentary or temporary hold in order for you to rebaseline your project. From a project administration perspective is that you need to go back through and revise or update your project controls (issues & risk logs, milestones, deliverables, project schedule and your project plan and to reflect the new delivery date but the most important thing is to have the new baseline approved (first and foremost).  The key is once you rebaseline your project your only focus is your triple constraint and you need to actively manage your exceptions. The golden rule is if any one of the constraints of time, cost or change then the other two must change. All you do is ask if which one do they want to change because it's a causal effect relationship between the constraints and all your doing is putting the responsibility back on to the requestor and asking them to choose. Trust me, it sorts out pretty quickly if the change is really warranted or not.\n\nAlso keep in mind the person who rammed their agenda through can't dispute the facts when you can show evidence of where and how they got their change through but it also means that you have to be honest with your project board/sponsor/executive and admit that you could have handled this a little better (this is your lessons learned as a project practitioner, your triple constraint of time, cost and scope is your only priority and you have to document any exception to that agreed and approved baseline).\n\nGet your ducks lined up in a row and at your next status meeting raise the matter, the reality is the longer you leave it the worse it becomes. Go ready with your mapped chronology of events, understand your risks and issues, more importantly go with a proposed idea (e.g. a course of action) and ask for your project board/sponsor/executive for guidance on the matter.\n\nThe reality is that your project board/sponsor/executive is actually responsible for the success of the project, your responsibilities is to ensure the day to day business transactions are delivered. Keep in mind the project board/sponsor/executive can't nor shouldn't hang you out to dry on this because they're at fault just as much as you are. Good luck and this will work itself out in the end, just remember you need to be a little more diligent when handling change.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

This is also one of the reasons why Asana has less features than ClickUp while ClickUp feels bloated and complex. \n\nHowever, at the same time Asana is focusing more on Enterprise, even their home page screams Enterprise. \n\nSo if you are a SMB I would suggest looking at tools like SmartTask, Monday which combines CRM + Project Management + Time Tracking. With SmartTask, you even get process mapping support.",

I don't agree that Clickup has better automations I think that's a matter of how/what you design in Asana. Note that Asana's reporting and automations are part of the more expensive packages. ",

It keeps everyone in the same place.\n\nAsana is a bit more in-depth I guess when it comes to personalization/cistomization but in my experience it doesn’t cover all use cases. I found myself needing Slack also for communication and because information became scattered, we ended up not using Asana to its full extent\n\nI prefer clickup",
