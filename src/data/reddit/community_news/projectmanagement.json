      "text": "If someone asked me today what project management is actually like, I don’t think I’d start with timelines, tools or frameworks anymore. I’d probably start with the emotional side of it. The part where you’re expected to create clarity in situations where there genuinely isn’t any and still look calm while doing it.\n\nWhat surprised me most over time is how little of the job is about managing projects in the textbook sense. A lot of it is managing ambiguity, unspoken expectations, shifting priorities that no one formally acknowledges and the gap between what leadership thinks is happening and what’s actually happening on the ground. You spend a lot of energy translating between people who all use the same words but mean completely different things.\n\nI’d also warn them that being good at this job often looks invisible. When things go smoothly, it’s assumed they would have anyway. When something slips, suddenly everyone notices the PM. You don’t really get credit for preventing problems that never happened, even though that’s where a lot of the effort goes.\n\nAnd maybe the biggest thing: modern PM work can quietly turn into carrying a lot of mental load for other people. Remembering context, decisions, tradeoffs and history that no one else writes down but everyone expects you to recall instantly. It’s manageable but only if you’re aware of it early and learn how to protect your own bandwidth.\n\nIf you could give one honest warning to someone starting in project management today, what would it be?",

I’d give the following warnings:\n\n- Regardless of your (and the exec’s) instinct, there is no such thing as a tool which in itself allows effective project management. There are vast herds of salespeople who will tell you otherwise and if you buy their software, projects will effectively manage themselves. Fact is - not one single human will willingly take an instruction to complete a task from an automated system.  The sooner you accept this the better. \n\n- Unless you make it explicitly and continuously clear that you are not a ***product*** manager, you will be expected to own the project benefits. You will be expected to design, implement ***and then own*** products delivered during and after the project. The correct idea of a ***sponsor*** owning the benefits and business is alien to most people unless explicitly explained. I have - it seems - mortally offended colleagues when I’ve explained that I consider a project a success if it was closed early when the business case didn’t stack up anymore.\n\n- Finally - when people stop referring to a project as “the project” and start calling it ***“your project”***, you are irredeemably cooked. No way back.",

You are absolutely right that the textbook definitions of \"scope, schedule, cost\" completely miss the reality of the role, which is mostly about managing human anxiety and translating ambiguity into action.\n\nIf I had to give one honest warning to someone starting today, it would be to check your ego at the door because this job requires a very specific emotional contract. My philosophy has always been that when everything goes perfectly, congratulations to the team, but if something goes wrong, I am the first one asking myself \"what did I miss?\" You have to be willing to be the umbrella that gets wet so the team can stay dry.\n\nHowever, the flip side of that warning is understanding what \"success\" actually looks like in this career. It isn't a trophy or public applause. For me, the best reward has always been simply that a company is willing to deposit their trust (and their money) in my skills again. The ultimate compliment for a Project Manager when a project is completed isn't a party, it's just the fact that there is another complex project in the queue waiting specifically for you to lead it. If you can find satisfaction in that quiet continuity rather than public glory, you will survive a long time in this game.",

If you don’t thrive on conflict; if you can’t make a team understand and agree on score, budget and schedule, being a PM may not be for you. \n2. All estimates are guesses and all guesses are wrong. You job is to narrow the focus on destines to achieve a “liveable estimate.”\n3. Hold the Account Teams feet to the fire about what has been promised and what has been included in the contract and the SOW. Focus on differences. It’s fine to be a purist and stick strictly to the contract but if the Account Team/Sales gave the customer an expectation of bells and whistles and they are not there, then you face a situation where you have a technically successful project that the customer rejects and you get painted with the “difficult to work with” brush. \n\nI applied a technique that I learned about from my love of Formula 1. If a team suspects another team(s) of cheating, they send the ruling body, the FIA, a fax saying “If we wanted to do this and such to our car in this way related to FIA regulation XY.ZZ, would it be legal?” If the FIA says no then they quietly inform the FIA that they think Team B is doing that. \n\nSo I would communicate to all saying “The contract addresses this functionality as blah, but the SOW states that the functionality is blah plus B. If the final functionality achieved blah plus B minus, without schedule or budget impact, would that satisfy the requirements?”  \n\nThe response then goes into change control. \n\nAnd, finally, if you don’t thrive on conflict…yeah, I said that before. But to add to it, you need to do your homework to make sure you understand the issue, know the facts, know the options and can express all this clearly.",

Business cases, Risk and Change are next for me, with the emotional aspects of each discussed in parallel with processes. Finally, on to management and communication skills.   \nI agree with you that the emotional side is very important, but I think a framework / processes need to be laid out first so that you have something to map the strategies for EI management to.",

Servant leadership is a mentality that good leaders foster the growth of others around them. They become 'servants' to their team and the whole team thereby grows together instead siloed individuals doing really well and others falling off. Servant leadership is removing the barriers to make the team great. It can be assertive and aggressive but those are not in the top descriptive words I would use for this style of leadership. \n\nI am also a project manager and servant leadership fits in nicely with the way certain companies structure their project management organizations.\n\nIt doesn't work in some companies, but if you like that style of leadership, it may help you to know your own style. I think you can be good at any style of leadership without necessarily being aggressive. When I think of a manager wanting more aggressiveness, I'd guess they're talking about sales?

Use real data and feedback (from previous SMEs) to identify key insights and learnings.  Which parts of the projects are working well (validate these) and which need improvements?\n\n2. Focus on processes - do you have clear and simple steps for your projects, are they standardised, and are they documented, communicated and understood by all participants? \n\n3. structure/roles - are these clearly defined and understood.  Have you identified all key roles for the projects you run, and are each roles responsibilities/duties documented?\n\n4. Do you have the best possible people (resources) with the best matching skills (technical, non technical) to perform these roles?  You definitely need a dedicated PM. Need a Sponsor (key decision maker/influencer), Business Analyst (ensure scope and business requirements defined and understood, ensures IT Solution design and build is aligned), Lead IT Engineer (Arch), Developers, Testers, business SMEs.\n\n5. Tools review - tools are important, but they are there to support processes and the users, and choose a set that best supports your projects.  Keep it simple and effective.  The MS suite is adequate (including Teams, SharePoint), but you can optionally add Jira (for Agile dev projects), Trello (visual tracking) and Confluence (online content documentation).\n\n6. Most importantly, Identify and prioritise list of improvements, and develop an implementation plan for execution.  This includes assigning owners to Actions. \n\nHere’s some questions to help:\nA) Do you have pre-defined steps to deliver your projects?\nB) Can your projects be categorised based on complexity of delivery, eg. Simple, Standard, Challenging, High Risk?  You may only find that you only have two of these.  Choose whatever suits.\nC) Do you have key quality checkpoints throughout your project steps (aka Gates)\nD) Do I know my top key risk areas and have I built in enough contingencies to mitigate these, eg. Resource capacity, task duration, 10-20% budget, tight scope management (limit creep), key dependencies, gates for approvals, etc.\n\nHope this helps, and good luck.",

I started referencing similar projects TRACs for our estimates and made sure we at least quoted that (unless something could be somewhat reused). \n\nThe other issue is our boss and owner restrained us from planning too far ahead while quoting, but also generally thought quotes were too high based on his vibes. This meant scope became more detailed after the quote was sent, which also led to overruns.\n\nThe only times we've had good budgets is when we were able to do all our planning before the quote, but that does mean racking up 20 or more hours that we might not be able to bill if the project doesn't get accepted. I still think this is better than being in a position to be 50, 100, or more hours over.\n\nThe other issue is clients often don't want to be explicit during the quoting process. Even if scope creeps up because of their lack of detail during quoting (no matter how detailed my questioning), that doesn't mean we won't be blamed.\n\n(I notice that clients are especially resistant to wanting to spell out max numbers of quantifiable deliverables, which is absolutely necessary for an accurate quote. If they don't give that to us, we have to assume—and corporate leadership may restrain me from specifying max deliverables in X category of the quote because they're concerned it won't get accepted if that limit is imposed.) \n\nThe basics of overages fall into the broader category that the people with the most power to either estimate/approve the time (technical staff and corporate leadership responsible for sales respectively) or to detail the scope (client) don't want the responsibility to do so, and the responsibility falls onto the PM even though they don't have control (that would be whoever controls sales/contracts). Wherever responsibility is divorced from power and control, it will produce conflicts, both internally and with clients.",

Until I see the corporate standard in the US shift to an expectation that there is no control without responsibility, I do not believe this will improve.\n\nMost people are concerned with the appearance of success and no failures than showing the actuality of work, and because most \"leaders\" do not actually have the attention span to learn how work actually gets done, corporations incentivize communication about work more than the risky decisions that actually advance a project. The whole incentive structure is thus too corrupt in most organizations to improve this.\n\nSo instead we have leaders that accept responsibility for successes they didn't actually provide operational decisions on and reject responsibility/pass blame for failures. We see this exact same behavior at the very top of our US economy, with CEOs and board members endlessly circulating around companies regardless of their records. As long as \"leaders\" continue to prioritize their own interests over their projects and clients/customers, and this class camaraderie remains durable enough to isolate said \"leaders\" from the negative consequences of that betrayal of the work itself, these problems will persist indefinitely.\n\nPMs are easy to blame because they appear responsible even though they are generally deprived of the control that would allow them to actually be responsible, and most Americans aren't interested in reading or thinking deeply enough to actually understand whether such blame is warranted.\n\nThis is also why PM roles will never die. They give corporate leaders a scapegoat to blame. They can't be replaced by AI because no AI company will accept blame for the negative consequences of AI output either. Someone's got to take the heat, and it sure as hell is not going be the C suite.",

But it does mean that any change needs to address the underlying reasons - good or bad.\n\n\nI just mapped out a process that, end to end, takes 85 days. It's just one part of what it takes to launch a specific type of marketing thing. It requires 6 teams and more than 40 individual steps. Why? Ancient, creaking technology hobbled together with Scotch tape, misaligned planning cycles, resource constraints, etc. There's no speeding that up. \n\n\nIf leadership wants to move faster, they can redesign the process, implement the right tools and training, and staff the right teams. Demanding that we \"move faster\" doesn't change the process or the reasons that process exists. Workarounds often result in longer delays down the line when teams have to put out fires. Do it right slowly, or wrong even more slowly. \n\n\nI push for change by laying bare the systems at play and telling leadership to fix it or they aren't going to get what they want. But am I pushing major change in my little corner of the company? Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't really have the reach to do it. I'm already working 60 hours per week to keep our head above water (which in the new year I'm scaling back big time), so I'm not improving anything of my own volition except that which reduces my personal workload. \n\n\nBut when I worked at a company where I was staffed to 90% capacity (purposefully!), we identified and improved processes left and right. I loved joining tiger teams to help us be more lean or agile, test new tools, etc. ",

      "text": "I want to understand this from a project management point of view and also learn from real experiences.\n\nLet us take one scenario. You are working in one industry, say banking or financial services (but this can apply to ERP or any other IT system also). You want to implement a new IT system. There are many software vendors in the market who offer SaaS or licensed products.\n\nBecause competition is very high, especially among new or small vendors, what usually happens is over-commitment during sales. Sales or pre-sales teams promise a lot of things, “yes this is available”, “yes this can be done”, “this is already there in the system”. Most of the time, these sales people are not very technical and they are not part of the delivery or implementation team. They close the deal and move on.\n\nOnce you sign the contract and start implementation, you are handed over to the delivery team and project managers. Then reality hits. They say things like “this feature is not available”, “this is not industry-specific”, “this will require customization”. At a high level, sales did show some alignment, but at a detailed level, many things are missing.\n\nNow if you ask for changes or industry-specific features, they say it will be a Change Request (CR) and you have to pay extra. At this stage, you are stuck. You cannot easily switch vendors because the switching cost is very high. You have already invested time, money, and effort. You also end up paying additional costs which were never clearly mentioned during sales, because those details were hidden at a granular level.\n\nThe bigger problem is that if you go back to the market to look for alternatives, the same thing happens everywhere. High competition, aggressive sales, over-commitment, and low pricing to enter the account.\n\nSo my core question is:  \nAs a customer or as a project manager, what options are really left in this situation? How have you handled this in your projects? What practical steps have you taken to mitigate this issue - during vendor selection, contracting, or implementation?\n\nI am not limiting this to BFSI. It can be ERP, CRM, core systems, or any large IT implementation. I want to learn from your real experiences on how you dealt with this problem and what actually worked (or did not work).",

The sales person doesn't care, the sale is made, they hit their target, and they drive away into the sunset....  And them me and my team have to deal with it. \n\n\n\n\nHonestly, always read the contract and the sow well. Record the sales sessions. Ask if everything that was demoed is included. Ask what happens if you need customizations. Assume they are trying to trick you, because they are. \n\n\n\n\nAfter signature, make sure the implementation team knows what happened during the sales cycle, and tell them when things don't align.

I'm a PM for IT vendors for 5+ years delivering software projects. Had and heard of many poorly priced projects, and it very often boils down to misunderstanding/misrepresentation of requirements during the sales process.\n\nVery highly dependent on how vendor handles it, we tend to include a buffer for unexpected scope adjustments that weren't fully clear at the point of signing. If the budget is fixed, we sometimes have to renegotiate the scope to deliver usable solutions while sacrificing the bells and whistles. Sometimes vendor just takes a hit and delivers the project at a lower margin if the sales process was completely botched.\n\nIf you need a piece of software and don't have anyone to put down specific, well laid-down requirements from your side, or look for a vendor to solve a particular problem with only vague idea on how to do it, I always recommend spending a small chunk of budget you have for the project for at least 1-month discovery process involving the delivery team. Salespeople rarely know which specific questions to ask to hit the nail on the head and avoid overcommitting (not saying it applies always, but I saw my fair share of incompetence or just pure lack of experience knowing how delivery process actually looks like). Spending a few sessions with the delivery team (PM, Solution Architect) who have experience delivering, not selling, goes a long way to get a more precise budget estimation and keeps everyone's expectations on the same page.\n\nDecent vendors will have a transparent discovery process as part of sales before committing to an SOW for the implementation phase. They will list down requirements together with you and define what at least larger chunks of it will do, and what they won't do. If they promise you the world, I would question that as a client.

I hesitate to write this because I hated clients that wanted everything in writing. Projects change very quickly from both ends. What you desperately want in the buying stage could end up being less important later on - what use is the SoW then?

For example, they are overseeing the complete overhaul of our analytics platform to improve visibility to the broader groups function.\n\nNow the good part. Our team has no structure or processes (despite being the process team). Everything is simply handled in emails or meetings. We told our manager that we could benefit from some project management tool like Jira or MS Planner, to which her response was \"I'm not a project manager.\"\n\nShe went on to say things like \"I expect you to manage the projects that I give you.\" None of us have any direct reports. We are analysts that specialize in reporting or offering basic tech support to our business group. To me, this was completely absurd.\n\nAm I wrong here?

          "text": "A manager with direct reports has an obligation, to the company, to make sure s4!t gets done, and done well.  This can involve elements of project management, but it doesn't matter if you're right or wrong.\n\nTo be fair, it sounds like you raised a need to your manager and your manager dismissed it.  It can suck when that happens.  A manager with direct reports has an obligation, to the direct reports, to make sure they have the tools they need to do their job effectively, often within limits imposed by the larger organization.  So, what is it that you really need to do your job effectively?  How can you use influence to help your manager understand that need and what can be done about it?  What is the problem that really needs to be solved?  How can you approach this so that you have a better understanding of your manager's position and why she responded the way she did?\n\nIt doesn't matter who is right or wrong; that's the wrong question.  I don't have enough information to identify the right question, but consider the following: \"What conditions need to exist for work to be delivered predictably and well?\"  This is a question you should ask yourself, keeping in mind that tools may be part of the answer, but they're not the first or most important part.  It seems like a fair amount of modern \"project management\" tools are really work management tools with project management features, among other things.  You probably would see some benefit from tracking projects in a common tool.  Is that the most critical or easiest problem to solve?  \n\nAfter answering the above question, if you feel the need to continue the conversation with your manager, consider the following questions:\n\n* How would you like us to coordinate, track, and communicate progress across assigned projects?\n* What level of visibility and predictability is needed, and how should we provide it?\n\nDo you already have the answers to these questions, or do these expectations needs clarified?  Can you approach this from the perspective of \"I feel like something is missing\" as opposed to \"You're doing it wrong\" (which is how your actions may have been interpreted, regardless of your intent)?  Consider the following statements:\n\n* I feel like something is missing in how our work comes together.\n* I want to make sure the projects you assign are delivered cleanly and predictably.\n* I think we could reduce rework and surprises if we had more shared visibility.\n\nDescribe what you're experiencing and why it matters to the work, without naming the failure or the fix.  This probably feels counterintuitive.  Aren't we trained to bring solutions, not just problems?  The short answer is yes, we are, but if you've reached a conclusion, on your own, without also sharing alternatives that you considered and why you rejected them, you could be coming across as not having done your homework or fully understanding the situation.\n\nIf you and your manager are both rational people, this approach can work.  There are no guarantees, and there are other ways to approach your situation.  If your manager is irrational or considers you to be irrational, there may not be much you can do and it really won't matter if you're right or not.",

This leaves you open to a major disruptor, however - loud, squeaky wheels - which you cannot avoid if there is not someone at a higher level establishing priorities and aligning work requests with strategic objectives.  Ideally this would be a person or committee (shudder) with more authority than the people requesting work.  If you and your peers have to share resources on your projects your manager could help with competing priorities, but that's really just shifting the burden upward, not solving the problem. \n\nYou might want to take a step back and look at it from a systems perspective.  It's not just one project or just your projects or just your team's projects.  There's a whole ecosystem of project work, operations work, personalities, motivations, technological systems, people systems, conflicting priorities, etc that you're operating within.

You may find either MS or Google suite are sufficient but I’d consider PPM tools that you assess meet your specific requirements.\nIt’s also important to define the key skills required for PMs and support them to optimise their execution, and to learn them if development is required.",

I have to manage information across 9 workstreams, 15 teams, and 50+ people. \n\nI'm struggling to centralize a firehose of information from…\n- Slack Overload: 25-30 critical Slack channels, over 100 messages daily (maybe 30% of which are important?)\n- Decentralized Docs: Scattered documents, decks, sheets, and dashboards across multiple teams\n- \"Side-of-Desk\" Work: No one is full-time on this launch, so information is dumped everywhere by fast-moving people\n- Meeting-focused Culture: There’s the recurring meetings sure, but there’s pop-up and ad-hoc meetings all day, every day. We do have Zoom AI as a note-taker but it has a ton of limitations and also sucks.\n\nIn a normal job, I'd connect Slack/gSuite to a modern tool (Asana, Notion, Jira, etc.) to create a central source of truth. Then, I could do the actual job, and “knowledge management” was just sort of a service I provided out of my spare time.\n\nBut here, we only have disconnected tools, and all connectors and plugins are blocked by IT (no Zapier, no apps, bots, or workflows for Slack, no add-ons for gSuite...).\n\nThe only solution I see is blocking off two hours every single day for manual documentation, which is unsustainable. As a human brain I am not having much trouble juggling all this information, but there isn’t any way to actually document it without a ton of manual work.\n\n**How can I effectively collate hundreds of tiny pieces of information every day, preferably without spending half or more of my work week doing manual grunt work?** How can I create a source of truth that isn't just \"go ask painterknittersimmer\"?\n\n*P.S. - No need to shill your homegrown vibe-coded app or even your favorite SaaS.

That’s the trap that burns you out. Instead, pick one thing to be authoritative and let everything else be disposable. For me, that’s usually a single running 'decision + status' doc per workstream. Not meeting notes. Not transcripts. Just decisions made, open questions, and current status. If it didn’t change a decision or unblock work, it doesn’t go in.\n\nSecond, treat Slack like an inbox, not a system of record. I’ll skim aggressively and only extract three things at the end of the day: decisions, risks, and commitments. I literally ignore the rest. If someone later asks 'was this discussed? my answer is 'if it mattered, it’s in the doc. People adapt surprisingly fast.\n\nThird, create a dumb but visible cadence. Daily or every other day, post a short update in a shared channel or doc like 'What changed today / What’s blocked / What’s next.' This isn’t for leadership polish, it’s to force signal out of noise. You’re basically turning yourself into a human filter, but with guardrails.\n\nFourth, accept that your source of truth will be incomplete and biased, and be explicit about that. Write at the top: 'This reflects current understanding, not every conversation.' That sentence alone reduces a ton of anxiety and blame later.\n\nLast, protect your time ruthlessly. Two hours a day of manual documentation is not sustainable, you’re right. Cap it. If information doesn’t make it in because you ran out of time, that’s a resourcing problem, not a personal failure.\n\nNone of this is elegant. It’s very old school PM survival mode. But it’s usually enough to keep the launch moving without you becoming the single point of cognitive failure.\n\nAnd yeah… the 'go ask X' anti pattern is a flashing red org smell. You’re not wrong to be applying elsewhere.",

And it's comforting that some of this I was already doing (the weekly update that's just \"what I know\").\n\n\nHonestly, what I think I've learned in asking this is that I'm so deeply uncomfortable with this chaos. I mean, there's always a lot of chaos. But not knowing what's happening across a lot of what is theoretically within my \"program\" just feels so wrong. Not having an answer when people ask me something feels inherently like failure. Which I suppose it is, but it's an organizational failure I can't solve all on my own, and certainly not with little more than pen and paper. \n\n\nI'm not currently spending more than a few minutes on documentation, it just means there's no source of truth on anything. \n\n\nHere's an example of the kind of thing that's making me go grey:\n\n\nAt this point my only documentation is a program plan I update as much as I can (RAID and links mostly at this point) and my status updates to the major channels. \n\n\nLast week I sent a status update about one of my core workstreams. It was a normal update for a problematic, extremely red workstream, a TLDR and then a 300ish word explanation of the problems we were facing. \n\n\nI got two complaints that I included too much information and one suggested I should start an investigation document and keep a bunch of those instead of posting the \"dirty laundry.\" \n\n\nThere's absolutely no fucking way I have the time to create a *new* document for every single thing that happens. Even if I did, who is going to read a whole document that can't be arsed to read a status update?\n\n\nI feel like I'm going crazy. This is nothing like any work I've ever done before.",

You also need to start using your project controls to escalate your issues and risks because I'm going to assume you're already behind schedule and as a warning the longer you leave verifying your planning the more impact your current schedule will have, also has your current schedule been approved and baselined?  If not, that is another red flag. \n\nYou need to re-validate your business case and understand your project requirements and deliverables. I would strongly suggest that you take at least a full day workshop with your team to run through the requirements and start mapping out as a team and show your team how to develop a schedule e.g. explain things like effort and duration and explain what the triple constraint is and how it impacts you as the project manager. You need to challenge their effort estimation but you also may need to involve their managers as part of the approval process of the project schedule, it's just an operational sanity and quality check.\n\nYou as the PM need to have your project plan and schedule updated to ensure that you have captured everything, then you will need to have it approved by your project board, hence why you need to escalate your current situation. I will be pointed, in part you have already lost some control over your project and you may need to consider rebaselining your project because it sounds like you have not captured all requirements correctly and it's why you need to get your project board involved. \n\nTools or AI are not going to help you because you're missing a fundamental understanding of your project requirements and the correct forecasted effort, it's highly probable that you will need to rebaseline your project or you will be potentially setting your company and your project up to fail.  \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

For completely new work you can base it on work you have done before but estimates will always be somewhat off, even for an experienced team. Junior team members can learn this quickly from sr colleagues. \nHaving an entire jr team is simply not a good base for a team that needs to focus on quick results in a startup. Your focus seems to be to be on what tools the team uses to track the work but honestly this does not really matter. Focus on getting a more senior team member in that can teach them how to structure and execute the work, after a couple of months the rest of your team will be getting better at estimations based on this experience. ",

      "text": "I'm in a PM support role and currently love the trajectory. Very early into the role, one of the projects was up for audit. During this time, I was really clicking with the PM because I was learning and eager to help, and they voiced some insecurity in the specific sector of PMing (lol). I first noticed, during the audit, that the PM would pose a question to me about a process, I'd dig and find the solution and they'd present it as their own work externally. Initially, I wanted to name it but I was green so I didn't vocalize my frustration in that. \n\nNow, months and months later, this same PM does the same thing on an even bigger scale by deliberately using their role to \"delegate\". I quote that because the delegation is simply off loading work they don't want to do. It's becoming a real problem because if I question the task ownership, my question is escalated as non-compliance and then it's all turned back on me. \n\nI say anxious because that's exactly what it is. I can best describe it as pacing. Even though we mainly work remotely, I can feel the anxiety in the repeated messages, the constant tinkering with established and trusted processes, and passive aggressive behavior. Their leadership style is also very anxiously asking, not being assertive until questioned and then blame shifts. \n\nThe behavior is noticed by other team members but they essentially can ignore it because of the minimal contact they have with the PM, unlike me. \n\nI'm open to hearing how you all would navigate this. I've been empathizing with the workload and potential burnout on the PM but that's not an excuse for the behavior towards me. ",

That ONE moment of inquiring turned into being voluntold to format (extensive Excel work) the costing sheet to be filtered easier for the PM AND to own and manage the completion of a change request form that was needed to obtain approval in a change order. When I didn't immediately complete the asks, the PM followed up with wanting to see the \"Task Matrix for understanding our roles and responsibilities\"",

When the project handover was conducted there were some comments made from the handover person to me but I took them with a grain of salt and wanted to draw my own conclusions. The audit was the first major indicator that the first team member was not bluffing. \n\nThe PM does not and has not ever served as a mentor or coach. On the other hand, I have a GREAT line manager that serves as both. For instance, there was a set of trainings there were for PMs only and my LM granted me manual access to attend said trainings because I wanted to learn more. The PM never attended those series of trainings, even with my reminders that they were mandatory for them. \n\nI didn't want to get too specific but the financial tasks that I was interested in were very specific to the overall project and industry. Nonetheless, I stopped asking the PM about the ins and outs because I didn't want it to be dumped on me like before. \n\nThe points of escalation aren't flat out \"xyz is not doing _ task when I ask\", it's more weaponized incompetence and said like \"__ task needs to be done, I'm not sure who does it, but I think xyz (me) can handle it\". This has been done with my line manager, the project director and even executive level. The PM has even agreed to complete a task, ask me to provide the standardized verbiage stating that PMs are the owners of said task, escalated it, and received a reply that PM owns but can pass on completion of the task to anyone else, and then placed the task back on me to complete. This entire cycle is in writing and recorded video.",

I would challenge your notion or understanding of responsibilities are clear because due dates are not being met. When you have an approved project plan that is your executive saying is that we are committing time, money and effort for this project and all you do is hold up a mirror to the organisation because you're working on behalf of the executive. If people are constantly missing deadlines your only option is to escalate or ask your board which constraint of time, cost or scope do they want to change. The rule is if one changes then the other two must change, it's inter-relational. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I am brand new to the world of PM. I have no formal PM training but have done some of it informally with various work-related/extracurricular stuff in my life.\n\nI am currently in the position of \"organizational consultant\" to my family's garment factory. I have been exploring various tools such as Slack, Asana, etc. We all use Whatsapp groups right now—an obvious nightmare lol. However, there are some limitations to my use case: **Most of the employees don't speak English** or any other supported language, so getting all the people who, in a tech-savvier, English-speaking company, would be on the app, is not possible. For example, I cannot get department heads on the app. \n\nAlso, while I would like to get more sign offs, timelines, that kind of thing in front of employees, these apps seem to have too many bells and whistles. **Many of our employees are not particularly tech savvy** and getting them to use a Silicon Valley-built app with all its features would be tough. Right now the factory does a LOT of work on paper. The only people with a computer are the manager, the admin assistants, and the white collar dept (accounting, graphic design). Everyone directly involved in production solely uses paper printouts and Whatsapp. So documents and other visual aids are naturally kept simpler to parse.\n\n**What I *think* would be ideal is an app that needs to be used only by the manager and admin assistant**, as those are the tech savviest people I have the most communication with. I am already doing some spreadsheet training with them (this is the level we're at, they're smart but the knowledge just isn't there!) so I could train them to use the app to create checklists, Gantt charts, and other aids for the various departments. \n\n**Basically: I want the department heads to be able to sign off on things, consult checklists, view timelines, etc. but I want the manager/admin assistant to be the one to make and deliver print outs.** I hope that makes sense, I understand this situation is quite different from the average U.S. office.\n\nI am also very open to any other thoughts you may have on my situation, outside of apps. Like I said I am new to the world of PM and I am sure I have much to learn. Our company has been hit hard by tariffs and we are trying to keep things afloat so everyone can keep food on the table in 2026. I am very grateful for any advice you can provide.",

If you don't follow the above process you run a very high risk of ending up with a white elephant because staff will not see the benefit or it improving their day to day working life and find work arounds or not even use the system at all. Then that falls on to you because you spent a large amount of company money on something that doesn't work. \n\nYou need to shift your perspective, an application doesn't fix the problem unless you know what is actually wrong and that is by understanding what the technical and user requirements are and how they're used in a business workflow. You also need to explain to the executive, if they cut corners and not invest in understanding the problems, you will fail as a company, waste money and put the business at risk. \n\nAlso the attitude of \"I want, I think\" is not a position of strength, you need to show your executive on why a system is needed, with justification and choices. You need to show the benefit (s) of what you're proposing because there would be a significant investment required. Also something of a reflection point, if you don't understand the problem you run the very real risk of being \"that person\" who screwed up. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

          "text": "Unless I'm misunderstand your wisdom what you describe is good planning practice, is breaking larger and longer take into their consistent parts. The tricky bit tends to be \"what level to break them down into\".   I tend to use the resources needed to identify the break down, ie when a different resource set is needed split that tasks out. The simple example is \"produce spec\" could be one line but if you consider the resources involved we have the author, review group and sign off authority, this leaves a logical split of draft, review, amend, signoff.  In this way your plan tells the story of how the spec is produced, becomes faster to update and more accurate. \n\nLinking the tasks is vital. If you then set deadlines in the end you can see the slack in the schedule as others have said and use that to see if a bit of slippage can be accommodated or if you have to take action to pull it back.\n\nOf all the tools out there only ms project and P6 seem to handle linking tasks well, the rest seem to be card based collaboration and task tracking tools with done scheduling tracked on. However my experience is heavily MSP based so I'm open to learning this is no longer the case :)",

This is counter intuitive but works because rather than having to think \"I've done x and y but z is delayed, how far through this am I\" you simply mark x and y as done and adjust z to the new times :). Let the machine take the strain. \n\nIt does mean that I make use of filters or summary plan-on-a-page (POAP) reports to simplify the presentation of the plan but these are reports from the detailed plan rather than the planning tool :)\n\nHowever everyone plans differently which is why there's an awful lot of art alongside science in planning and communicating the plan :)",

But depends on why you need them. \n\nIf it’s to ensure you have enough time for every part of the job (not forgetting quality checks etc) then make sure that every part of the job is scheduled. Thorough reviews take time. So does document control or other administrative burdens that come with formally completing or signing off a project or workstage. \n\nOn the other hand, if it’s simply tracking deadlines separately from the WBS, just add some milestones or tasks that represent your agreed scheduled deadlines. MS project is obvs a candidate for this but then so are most of the online apps. \n\nAlternatively, you could also keep your actual contractual/official deadlines secret and set some pretend early task completion dates for your team. Depends on your team structure / culture etc.",
