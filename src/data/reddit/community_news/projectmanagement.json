      "text": "For most of my career I watched the same cycle repeat.\n\nSomeone gets hurt or nearly hurt. Leadership responds with more training. More signage. More toolbox talks. Crews nod along. The behavior doesn't change. Six months later, same incident, different person.\n\nThe one that finally broke the cycle for me happened on a remote pipeline job in northern Alberta.\n\nWe had a protocol: specific tools had to come from the equipment yard, roughly 200 yards from the active work zone. The safe procedure was clear. Walk back, get the right tool, walk back out.\n\nNobody did it.\n\nThey used whatever was within reach. Every time. We disciplined people. We retrained people. We posted reminders. The workaround persisted because the workaround was efficient and the procedure was inconvenient.\n\nThe fix wasn't more training. It was pre-staging tool kits at each work zone and eliminating the 200-yard walk entirely.\n\nBehavior changed immediately. Not because people suddenly cared more about safety. Because we stopped designing a system where the safe choice was the hard choice.\n\nWhat I eventually understood after 25 years in the field: the system chooses the behavior more than the individual does. If your procedure requires people to consistently choose inconvenience over efficiency, your procedure will lose. Every time.\n\nThe question that changed how I managed everything after that: are we asking people to do the right thing, or are we designing systems where the right thing is also the easy thing?",

It was redesigning the workflow so the safe action was also the most efficient action.\nMost organizations miss: if compliance requires friction, friction will win.\nBut when you remove waste, you don’t have to enforce behavior – you align it.\nThat principle scales across industries as well, but I focus on construction.",

Long story short about 3 weeks after implementing the change system we had a major outage and rather than taking hours, the on call engineer went to the change management system and found the problem in 20 minutes.  The hook was set because the team found benefits in the system but I also managed to get further intangible benefits because I was able to get analytics from the system, the team turned the system in to a game of challenge of who could log the most change requests, this was a totally unexpected benefit but it also helped mold the team's organisational behaviour.\n\nThis experience has been one of my biggest lessons in my professional career, if your system doesn't show benefit or you can't get buy in, you can't force users regardless of what you do. Work with your stakeholders to ensure that you have their input because it's part of the buy in process. Oh and the guy who gave me absolute grief, he turned out to be the biggest user of the system, I was making some huge assumptions on my behalf and one them thinking he was just being an a-hole but the funny thing he only wanted two minor things changed to make it more efficient for him (not such an unreasonable request at the end of the day).\n\nJust an armchair perspective",

In a lot of the cases, people already know the procedure. The real issue is friction. If the safe or correct option is slower, harder, or inconvenient, the workaround will win almost every time.\n\nThe pipeline example captures that perfectly. The behaviour did not change because people suddenly cared more. It changed because the system stopped forcing them to choose between efficiency and safety. Once the right option became the easy option, the workaround disappeared.\n\nThat lesson applies far beyond that type of work. You see the same pattern in offices, healthcare, nonprofits, everywhere. Staff bypass clunky processes, skip steps that slow client response, and create informal shortcuts just to keep work moving. Leaders often treat this as a compliance or attitude issue, when it is really a design issue.\n\nThe question you ended with is the one more leaders need to sit with….. are we asking people to do the right thing, or designing systems where the right thing is also the easy thing?\n\nWhen systems are built around how work actually happens, behaviour changes without pressure, discipline, or repeated retraining.

Its not because projectmanagement is bad - Sure its complex, difficult and so called \"professionals\" are sometimes big babies but overall its all worth it once the project is done and you have something to show.\n\n  \nNO - the issues are companies that abuse the project manager role and add the role of product owner, Scrum Master, Projectmanager and IT-Expert all together. All of the sudden you are not managing 1 or 2 projects, no you are managing 5 projects, 3 initiatiaves, 6 stupid BAU problems, complaints from Cyber (WTF do i know about header configurations?), 5 reports and 2 audit findings, while fighting legal, data protection, bureaucracy and management.\n\n  \nSometimes it feels like im firefighter, fighting a forest fire with my littel bucket of water and the moment i put 2 flames out, 8 new ones show up. Right now i just want to let everything burn, maybe this bs can rise like a phoenix from the ashes (or will probably just stay dead and rot). \n\nI know things will get better, and i know the cash is good but man sometimes the way companies handle this role is really frustrating.

          "text": "To be honest, project managers are typically under appreciated and under valued in an organisation, typically when things go well, nothing is said but when things go bad, it's your head that is on the chopping block. Generally most PM's are over utilised because they get to be the stop gap to poor organisational policy, process or procedures but I also find PM's also don't actually push back either because they're being told by their management team it will be their responsibility.  \n\nI got taught one of my most valuable lesson when I was first starting out, I was faced with being highly over utilized in a new company I had recently joined and wanted to show I was a good employee. I had 18 active projects (yes, proper projects) of various sizes, complexity and costs and I would spend my whole day running from meeting to meeting and I would literally start my project administration work typically at 5:00-5:30 pm and I was usually working a 12-15 hour day. \n\nA peer of mine was concerned for my welfare and asked how was my workload being prioritised, I genuinely couldn't answer their question. His advice is something that I've never forgotten and one of my biggest lessons I've learned as a Project Practitioner and the question when being overloaded is to ask \"what goes on hold whilst I take on this higher priority task?\" and if you don't get an appropriate response then you start using your project controls of issues and risk logs and escalate to the project board/sponsor/executive to address. \n\nIn relation to my anecdotal story, I pushed back on to the Program Director and Account Manager with the simple question of priority. Long story short the proverbial hit the fan after the client was asked to provide a priority listing, the list was whittled down to 6 active projects and the rest were either placed on (in priority) hold or abandoned outright. This very experience taught me such a valuable lesson as a project practitioner because there is only so much one person can do, and I'm not the whipping boy!\n\nJust an armchair perspective    ",

          "text": "I've implemented Agile in several organisations.\n\nOne of the major tenets of any Agile implementation is that you need the buy-in of senior management. What are your senior management saying?\n\nPut simply, if it's your boss (or boss's boss) who has more sway, then your approach will win. If their boss has more sway, their approach will win. This has nothing to do with what is good for the business or the customers. This has everything to do with empire-building and who gets to look good.\n\nOne of the errors people make when implementing Agile is the belief that somehow, because Agile is iterative, that problems disappear. This is obviously nonsense. People seem to think that \"being responsive\" means that's it's fine to keep changing things all the time, thereby ensuring you have no clear product or \"definition of done\", and a pipeline that is full of senior managers' vanity projects.\n\nDeadlines still exist in Agile: they form a part of an item's priority. When you discuss work items with the Agile team, talk in terms of priority. If you need something done by a certain date, tell them that this deadline is a dependency, and that this should be factored into the priority of the item. You should allow the Agile team to break down your item however they want in order to achieve its delivery, but be clear that your ultimate deadline needs to be met.\n\nThe main difference between waterfall and Agile is that, in waterfall, the Product Spec is generally fixed. This makes sense since, if you are developing a high-rise building, you want to be clear about how much concrete you need to pour, when, and where it goes. Ask your Agile team how they intend to deal with this known problem. Ask it from a place of curiosity, not criticism. How will they ensure an Agile delivery of something physical? \n\nRemember, like every good American idea, the British thought of it first. DSDM predated Agile and was created to allow rapid iteration, something which is not possible in the construction world. Since you can't quickly iterate a data centre build, how will the Agile team adapt to ensure these things happen when they need to while still running an Agile operation?\n\nOne of the founding principles of Agile is transparency. Ask them to make their delivery pipeline visible to you, and all of their backlogs as well. Anything other than a Yes is deflection and is not Agile. Yes, they will want to control what their stakeholders see to some extent (they don't want you banging their door down every day) but they **must** be open to bringing you in to the process. The concept of \"silos\" is inherently anti-Agile.\n\nAnyway, I could wax lyrical on this for ages. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nCheers",

Whenever there's any request for scope change, or anything that affects the schedule, the backlog is up for renegotiation.

In non-agile projects, it's more of a constant discussion about \"-Is this part of the requirements - of course it is! -No, that's not on a signed paper. -But according to our interpretations, it is! -But not according to our interpretation\", leaving the PM alone against the stakeholders. \n\n(sidenote: Many ppl think that agile implies scrum at a two-week cadence, but scrum only says 'less than a month', and imho, few actually follow scrum as it is defined.

          "text": "I did consulting work for a company where your pay was almost entirely connected to performance. \n\nEach concluded task resulted in getting points. Then the points determined your portion of a huge bonus pool. \n\nThere was a leaderboard of where everyone stood. This was hands down the most happy and productive place I've ever experienced. The only people who didn't flourish were those who came, sucked, and then left. That churn was high for new employees, but within a month or less most people knew if this was for them or not.\n\nThis could have resulted in a cutthroat Machivellian nightmare as people clawed and stabbed their way to the top of that leaderboard. But this wonderful term \"Confelicity\" definitely ruled. Once you showed that you were going to be a contributor, people wanted you to succeed. One simple reason was that everyone was given a clear view of the \"big picture\", meaning they saw the bonus pool size as coming from company success. So, if billy bob cooked up a killer feature and sales went up 5% because of that; people didn't care that billy bob got a huge bonus, as everyone else got a slightly bigger bonus as well. Fighting with billy bob would end up hurting everyone in the long run. Like the other baseball players begrudging the homerun king for \"taking too many home runs, he should share them. I hate my growing collection of world series rings.\"\n\nYou would now support billy bob in all his future endeavors, hoping he would hit another home run.\n\nI've explained, (as have the people who work there) how the system was completely amazing; and a huge number of people think they can point out endless flaws. But, the reality is that pointing out that it is impossible for bumblebees to fly. I won't argue aerodynamics, I will just point to the bees.\n\nThe only people for whom this place sucked were crappy programmers who, in most companies would rapidly become managers because they sucked so hard at programming. And just to shoot a common misconception. Junior programmers did find a home here as people would see their potential and mentor them. Also, the churn was so high, that they didn't select from \"top schools\" or any other BS. The programming interview was short, harsh, and was open to almost all takers. By harsh, I don't mean pedantic. But, had questions like, \"If you wanted to start a project with the most technical debt possible, what measures would you take?\" \"How does techncial debt present itself at the end of a project.\" \"What makes a good code review?\" and then they would often roast a person on their answer to this by asking, \"How does that add value and what would happen if you removed that from a code review?\" to nearly ever part of their answer.\n\nMy favourite on this one was when people almost always answered, \"Style guide, the code must follow a style guide or it is unreadable.\" \n\nThen, they would move on to the \"Find the bug\" portion of the interview where they would hand them a bunch of code with wildly varying styles. The bugs were generally easy to find, and not finding them would be a death cookie for the candidate. Then, they would ask, \"Did you have any trouble finding those bugs?\" The answer was usually no. And then they would ask, \"would you like to revisit your answer about style guides required to make code readable?\"\n\nWhile, the company did have a vague style guide, if the person rigidly held to the style guide as an important part of a code review, they were done as a candidate; as this clearly indicated the person had no idea how to work with others in a fluid give and take environment and required rigid rules to make communications possible. They clearly thought other people should have to follow those rules to communicate with them.\n\nThis last is the exact sort of person who would persist in arguing that bees can't fly. Also the sort of person who is technically capable of doing a thing, but will invariably do the wrong thing and make those around them miserable while doing it. No cofelicity to be found from that sort of person.\n\n\nVery little of the interview would confuse a junior programmer with any common sense.\n\nTo the somewhat subreddit topic. This company didn't have managers or PMs. There were the founders who provided a vision, and leadership; also through the points system, the incentive to work on what they wanted done. Then, under that it was a mob of over 200 people who followed that leadership. Within that mob some people worked reasonably independently, others were natural leaders and organized people who followed their lead as a team. This was all very fluid, but tended to form into little treehouses which were individually productive in their own way.\n\n\nI've seen the opposite. Not so much schadenfreude within the company, but it was such a cesspool of micromanagement, that when they have another round of layoffs, everyone who long ago left will ask, \"Did they finally fire James?\" or some other micromanager they hated. In this company there was no room for cofelicity as the managers stole all the successes, and nobody would congratulate them on their stolen valor.",

                  "text": "I watched a video once where some CEO was joking about how his people would wake up and ask, \"How can I create shareholder value today?\"\n\nHe was joking, but also serious about how it was wildly flawed that those who would benefit were just frustrating those below by holding them to account in the same way.\n\nI worked for a company where bonuses were pretty much even across the company. They were almost the equivalent of a year's salary. \n\nThen, one year everyone got something like 5k. Yet, the company profits were just as good as usual.\n\nIt turned out the managers had convinced the new head that they should allot bonus more for merit. In the months of planning who would get what, the managers just kept rationalizing giving themselves more and more and more. \n\nThe end result was the managers were told to hand the money back, and that maybe they would keep their jobs. If they quit and didn't hand it back, there would be a coming legal battle for them.\n\nThis didn't get most of the many employees who quit to come back. The relationship with the managers was now dead.\n\nIn this company, managers weren't paid more than those they managed. The company merged not long after, and then the whole merger died a dot com death.\n\nHad they not lost those people, and had they not merged; I'm not sure this company would have even seen a financial hiccup from the dot com bust.\n\nI think in most companies the problem is that people at the top really think they are the ones who make it rain. It is usually the team, with the occasional person who everyone knows is super valuable. A sales person who must be a jedi, a tech person who should be teaching at MIT, etc. But the reality is the bulk of people at all levels are helping, yet, managers on up are the ones taking as much credit as possible, and then rewarding themselves with as much money, privileges, etc as they can. There is no confelicity, in that too many accolades to other people might make them want more money, privileges, etc.\n\nA zillion years ago I knew the guy who built the entire computer system for a power company. (late 70s and early 80s). He was the guy. He invented, installed, configured, programmed, etc everything from scratch. He directly reported to the president, and was given a huge amount of leeway to do what he wanted, how he wanted. \n\nThen, the president changed, and annoited his son as head of engineering or CTO or something. The first day the son was there, he had this guy's office torn out. His \"office\" was beside the server room, which had to have their own clean cool environment. It was maybe 200 square feet. This guy showed up on Monday to discover the servers all sitting there on tables as the whole two rooms were an independent construction. He asked what the hell had happened when the son said, \"Only executives get offices, you are not an executive.\"\n\nHe did two things starting that morning. He reconfigured the power system so it would continue to function, but be 100% unmaintainable. He then started a company to sell all the things he had invented, created, etc to other power companies. Prior to that, they had been giving it away for free, as a free exchange. We give you this, you give us that, sort of thing. \n\nHe was minting it within months, and who knows how many millions it cost to replace all his unmaintainable stuff with GE gear? At least 10s of millions in 1980 dollars. It took him a week or two to make his mess and copy his work. He left without notice, or training anyone, the one person who did work with him as his apprentice (and backup) joined his new company.\n\nCompany culture comes from the very top.",

      "text": "Hey all, at the start of the year my team started looking for a new project management solution to track all of our work and act as a single source of truth and I was asked to look at what’s out there and put together a pros/cons list of each so we can make an informed decision. I ended up going pretty deep and felt like it might be useful to other teams.\n\nOur team lives in Slack (and we don’t want that to change) so I specifically focused on solutions with great Slack integrations. The dream was that we could keep working in Slack, but while having a one-stop-shop outside of Slack where you could see/manage everyone’s work. Sorry if you don't use Slack. Probably not relevant for you!\n\nThere are 100s of tools out there so I just focused on the top ones. Let me know if I missed anything important.\n\n# Summary Table\n\n|**Overall**|Overall|Ease of Use|Feature Depth|Slack Integration Quality|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|[Trello](https://trello.com/)|**4.3**|5|3.5|4.5|\n|[Asana](https://asana.com/)|**4.2**|4|5|3.5|\n|[Slack Lists](https://slack.com/blog/news/introducing-slack-lists)|**4**|4.5|2.5|5|\n|[Linear](https://linear.app/) (for dev teams)|**4**|4|3.5|4.5|\n|[Monday](https://monday.com/)|**3.8**|4|4|3.5|\n|[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) (for dev teams)|**3.8**|2.5|5|4|\n|[Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/)|**3.7**|5|2.5|3.5|\n|[Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)|**3.7**|3|5|3|\n\n# Breakdown\n\n# [**Asana**](https://asana.com/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 4 / 5**\n\nAsana is easy once your team agrees on a simple “how we use it” pattern (projects, sections, owners, due dates). The friction shows up when people try to use every view/feature at once - you’ll want a lightweight default workflow and templates.\n\n**Feature Depth: 5 / 5**\n\nAsana is built for *structured project execution*, not just tracking tasks: dependencies, milestones, approvals, and multi-homing (same task in multiple projects) are first-class concepts. \n\nExample: if “Client approval” slips by 3 days, dependency chains make it obvious what downstream work gets pushed, and approvals keep “approved/rejected” explicit instead of buried in comments. \n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 3.5 / 5**\n\nStrong for capture + basic action: you can create tasks from Slack, and use /asana to list/create/complete/comment on tasks from inside Slack. \n\nBut it still behaves like “Slack is where tasks are born; Asana is where tasks are managed” - people will click through when work gets real.\n\n# [**Monday.com**](https://monday.com/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 4 / 5**\n\nTeams often like it immediately because it feels like a visual spreadsheet with statuses. The downside is consistency - if every client board is configured differently, adoption drops because nobody knows where to look.\n\n**Feature Depth: 4 / 5**\n\nMonday can absolutely do PM fundamentals like dependencies and critical path, but some of the more “true PM” features (milestones/critical path in Gantt) are plan-gated, and the system is more board/column-centric than project-logic-centric. \n\nExample: you *can* run a launch chain in a Gantt view with dependencies, but keeping that chain clean across lots of client boards usually turns into more setup/maintenance (columns, views, and rules per board) than in a tool that treats dependencies/approvals as core workflow primitives. \n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 3.5 / 5**\n\nThe integration supports “create items from Slack messages” and “send updates to Slack” patterns, which is the minimum viable Slack workflow. \n\nIn practice, it’s solid for notifications + capture, but not a “run the project in Slack” experience.\n\n# [**Trello**](https://trello.com/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 5 / 5**\n\nThis is the easiest tool here to get a team actually using, because it matches how people already think: “to do / doing / review / done.” If adoption is your #1 constraint, Trello is hard to beat.\n\n**Feature Depth: 3.5 / 5**\n\nGreat for lightweight workflows; less great when you need real sequencing, cross-project visibility, or lots of interdependent deliverables. Example: “Launch date is March 15 so creative must be approved by March 8” can be represented, but it’s not naturally enforced the way dependency-first tools handle it (you’ll rely more on conventions, checklists, and discipline).\n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 4.5 / 5**\n\nTrello is very Slack-friendly: create cards from Slack, preview links, and save Slack messages into Trello (including an Inbox flow). \n\nExample: a client drops feedback in a Slack thread - you can turn that message into a card immediately, then the PM sorts it to the right board/list later. \n\n# [**Todoist**](https://www.todoist.com/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 5 / 5**\n\nFast, clean, and extremely low friction. People will actually use it - but mostly for *their own* tasks.\n\n**Feature Depth: 2.5 / 5**\n\nTodoist is excellent for personal productivity and light coordination, but it’s not a full team PM system (limited portfolio reporting, dependencies, multi-stage approvals, capacity planning). Example: it’s great for “rewrite homepage headline by Thursday,” weak for “manage a 30-asset campaign launch with reviews, handoffs, and client approvals.”\n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 3.5 / 5**\n\nVery good at capture: you can convert Slack messages into Todoist tasks via the message menu, and complete tasks from Slack via /todoist. \n\nBut it won’t give you a shared “project heartbeat” inside Slack - it’s more “turn Slack into a personal inbox.”\n\n# [**Airtable**](https://www.airtable.com/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 3 / 5**\n\nAirtable is easy to *use* once built, but harder to *design* well. Most teams need an owner (ops/PM) to keep the base clean, otherwise it becomes “power-user magic” that nobody else touches.\n\n**Feature Depth: 5 / 5**\n\nThis is the most flexible system here: you can model clients, campaigns, assets, revisions, approvals, and link them together like a database. Example: one campaign record can relate to 40 deliverable records, each with status, owner, due date, and client approval state - that’s Airtable’s superpower.\n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 3 / 5**\n\nThe native Airtable ↔ Slack story is mainly “send updates/notifications into Slack via Airtable automations” plus link previews - not “turn Slack messages into structured records” out of the box. \n\nExample: “when status changes to ‘Needs client approval,’ post to #client-approvals” is straightforward, but the actual work still lives in Airtable.  \n\n# [**Slack Lists**](https://slack.com/blog/news/introducing-slack-lists)\n\n**Ease of Use: 4.5 / 5**\n\nIt’s native to where your team already works, so adoption is naturally higher than any external PM tool. Example: you can turn a message into a list item and keep the context in the same channel/thread instead of asking people to “go update the PM tool.” \n\n**Feature Depth: 2.5 / 5**\n\nLists cover the basics well (task, status, assignee, due date, custom fields, subtasks), but they’re still “lightweight tracking,” not full project management. \n\nExample: you can track a launch checklist and assign owners, but you won’t get the same depth as Asana/Monday around dependency graphs, portfolio-level management, workload/capacity, advanced reporting, or complex multi-project governance - and you can hit list size limits (e.g., 1,000 items on Pro/Business+; higher on Enterprise) that external tools don’t typically constrain in the same way. \n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 5 / 5**\n\nIt *is* Slack, so the integration is perfect and everyone already has access.\n\nYou can also add automation via Workflow Builder (e.g., remind assignees about upcoming/overdue tasks, or post periodic status digests into a channel), which is exactly what a Slack-first team usually needs.  \n\nMy one complaint is that the tabs of Lists, Canvasses, pinned comments etc. can become a little messy and disorganized.\n\n# Dev Tools\n\nI included these for completeness but really Linear and Jira are meant for developer teams (which isn’t us).\n\n# [**Linear**](https://linear.app/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 4.5 / 5**\n\nLinear is opinionated and fast - most teams can be productive quickly because the workflow is largely “pre-decided” (issues + projects + cycles). Example: you can convert a Slack message into an issue in a couple clicks, and it can keep a synced thread so stakeholders stay in Slack while work progresses. \n\n**Feature Depth: 3.5 / 5**\n\nDeep for *software execution* (issues, projects/roadmaps, cycle planning), but less of a general “team PM swiss army knife” than Asana/Monday. \n\nExample: Linear excels at “track bugs + ship features” workflows, but if you want highly customized approval stages per client, elaborate request-intake forms, or heavily tailored reporting for non-technical stakeholders, you’ll feel the limits of its intentionally simpler model.\n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 4.5 / 5**\n\nOne of the best “Slack capture → real tracking” integrations: create issues from Slack messages, keep comment threads synced both ways, and post channel updates (including notifications driven by custom views). \n\nExample: a client drops a bug report in #client-acme - you create a Linear issue from that message and the Slack thread stays synced as the issue gets updated/closed, so your account team doesn’t need a Linear account just to stay in the loop. \n\n# [**Jira**](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)\n\n**Ease of Use: 2.5 / 5**\n\nJira is powerful but heavy - it’s easy for creative/ops teams to bounce off because there are many concepts (issue/work types, workflows, fields) and the UI assumes process maturity. \n\nExample: two teams can have totally different “Done” definitions because workflows are configurable - great for control, bad for adoption if your team just needs “track work without ceremony.” \n\n**Feature Depth: 5 / 5**\n\nIf you need enterprise-grade process control, Jira is top tier: configurable workflows, rich work categorization, and hierarchy (work items → epics → broader planning), plus advanced planning/roadmapping for multi-team programs. \n\nExample: you can enforce that “Client Approval” cannot move to “Scheduled” unless required fields are filled and an approval step happened - Jira can make that policy unskippable, whereas lighter tools rely more on human discipline. \n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 4 / 5**\n\nJira’s Slack app is legitimately capable: notifications, link previews, and the ability to interact with work items from Slack (assign, transition, comment) and create work items from Slack messages/threads. \n\nExample: you can keep a channel subscribed to updates for a Jira project and let teammates transition an issue (e.g., “In Progress” → “In Review”) directly from Slack without opening Jira. \n\nThe catch is adoption: even with strong Slack controls, Jira only works if your team buys into Jira-style process and hygiene.\n\nIf I missed any big ones let me know and I'll add it",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing such a detailed comparison. From experience working across consulting and internal teams, I want to point out some concerns with Monday and Asana that often come up once teams scale.\n\nMonday looks clean at first but every team ends up building boards differently. This leads to confusion and a lot of time wasted figuring out how things are structured. There is no true system of record unless someone takes the time to clean and standardize everything. Without that, adoption starts to drop and the tool becomes more work than support.\n\nAsana has a stronger set of features but requires consistent discipline to use well. In most teams, people use only a small part of it. Things like approvals and dependencies sound good but rarely get maintained properly. It starts to feel heavy for teams that just want to track and move work forward.\n\nA tool like Celoxis is often overlooked but actually solves many of the real execution problems. It handles budgets, resource planning, timelines, and reporting better than most tools on this list. If you are managing real client work or tracking project health at the portfolio level, Celoxis is worth considering. It is not flashy but gets the core project needs right.",

What you're getting is a single perspective from an individual that has had experience which may be very different from your own current situation.  I've seen some of my mentoree's try and follow a principle or approach of where they read something and thinking it was right but couldn't actually understand why their approach was failing. \n\nThe other thing to consider as a PM you just don't use a single discipline, experienced and more seasoned PM use numerous disciplines and principles such as finance, HR, contracts, procurement, change management, quality assurance management, operational management, subject matter expertise and the most important two disciplines is Emotional Quotient (EQ) or people soft skills and strategic positioning.  You have to understand these disciplines and master them with the more complex projects and programs that you undertake in the future. People in this thread will offer you suggestions because it was something that they have come across and resonated with them but if you find something which resonates, great then try it but also if it doesn't work then drop it. Don't keep on trying and hoping for a different outcome because that is the definition of insanity and it's amazing to see PM's consistently making the same mistakes. \n\nWhilst I'm not saying not to read but just to highlight the point that there is also no silver bullet to put you on the fast track to be a great practitioner, the only thing that does is practical experience. Also overtime as an experienced practitioner you will learn what doesn't and does work for you as your confidence and experience grows and your style emerges.  In short, take what ever you read and find out what does or doesn't work for you but also take it with a grain of salt because it's an individual's perspective and nothing more and don't fall into the trap thinking it's gospel or the only way to do things. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.

I remember I was very anxious during my first client presentation.\nHere are some tips that could help you \n- do box breathing before the meeting , drink a few sips of water , try to take a walk if you can or listen to your fav song before the meeting\n- prepare well in advance / practice before mirror/ it's okay to pause during présentations to refer notes. It's okay to say - I will come back to you after the meeting if you don't know the answer.\n- make sure to Include all key numbers / points in the slides you are  presenting so that you don't forget - this reduces the fear of getting struck or forgetting \n- they are normal people who also started as juniors - you are here to deliver the key messages and you will improve with experience \n- Also there are free YouTube videos that provide strategies for improving  communication & presentation skills \n\nIf you feel anxious during all of your daily tasks - you should check your blood panels.",

Consider talking to a doctor about these if you feel like the anxiety is affecting your performance or your mental well-being.",

Models themselves are capable of doing 99% of any white-collar job (hopefully I'm not getting hated by some \"domain experts\" who think the know-how in their brain is more valuable than a 1-trillion parameter SOTA model). People also hate on different benchmarks but they are good indicators of general/domain-specific intelligence. \n\nThen comes the elephant in the room, the app layer where you interact with AI. Think of the Co-pilot you've tested. There is so much to be optimized on the app layer, but you generally won't solve them with a stronger model (I guess theoretically you could when they are getting more advanced). The optimization comes mainly from understanding the specific workflows, good UI/UX, and better context management so there is less hallucination. \n\nI guess when folks say AI can't replace them, they are mostly pointing out at the mistakes AI might make as if humans don't make mistakes themselves. \n\n",

I know, I've spent a fair amount of time the last couple of decades leading IT and transformation programs to produce and implement that automation.\n\nToday's AI isn't intelligence. It's highly-optimized pattern-matching and next-in-sequence guessing. Specialized and optimized models just narrow the field for pattern-matching and the domain from which the next-in-sequence can be chosen.\n\nWhich is fine - when you get down to it, that also describes human intelligence. Humans just have a multi-billion year head start on development.\n\nFor a lot of white collar jobs, the vast majority of the work is working with people and working with uncertainty, two things AI is notoriously bad at. When you give AI a reasonably straightforward problem for which a clear answer already exists, it usually comes up with the right answer. Usually, because AI systems are non-deterministic; sometimes they will absolutely come up with the wrong answer, because the model generally has some amount of randomness built in, and that means it sometimes picks the lowest percentage answer instead of the highest. This is an oversimplification, but when you ask AI if 1+1 = 2, most the time the answer is yes. If you ask enough times it will tell you no.\n\nThat's nice, but the problem is that that the \"we already know the answer\" use case is already solved by rules engines that are deterministic. For a rules engine 1+1= 2, always. The challenge with rules engines is that the more you try to automate, the more rules you end up with as you try to account for every edge case. You rapidly approach the point of diminishing returns.\n\nWhat businesses are trying to do with AI right now is replace humans with non-deterministic AI models for the edge cases that are too complex for rules engines...and they're failing. They're failing because most of the time they're trying to solve use cases that require deterministic solutions. They're failing because they previously implemented deterministic solutions that also failed because they didn't address the underlying causes of those failures, which is decades - in some cases half a century or more - of disorganized data, business processes that only exist in the heads of a handful of people and are perpetuated via tribal knowledge, and absolutely massive piles of technical debt.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I use AI every day. There are a lot of places where AI saves me a ton of time in non-routine tasks, and there are definitely use cases where it is able to handle some of the time-consuming drudge work (meeting notes, etc). AI, implemented correctly, is much better than prior tools at searching and surfacing existing knowledge.\n\nIt's just bad right now at the business problems most people are chasing.",

Microsoft adds copilot. 1000 users use copilot but the company reports 10-15k of their workers use AI. They also report 2000 layoffs (These layoffs would've happened regardless). \n\nInvestors see these two reports and buy more shares. Shareholder value increases.

          "text": "I like how confident my fellow PMs are whenever AI comes up. But I think the reasons most of you give for why you won't be substituted are based on the wrong mindset. The reality on the ground, especially in software companies, is already moving past this debate.\n\nCompanies that are seriously adopting AI tools are effectively eliminating the repetitive work that many PMs consider their core job. Status updates, Jira grooming, scheduling, stakeholder comms, report writing, risk registers. If that's the bulk of your daily value, you should be worried. Not in 5 years. Now.\n\nAnd here's what I think people in this thread are missing.\n\nLook at what's already happened to developers. In software companies that embrace AI, devs are now expected to work across multiple frameworks, handle full stack responsibilities, manage their own pipelines, and use AI coding assistants daily. The skill bar has gone up massively and team sizes are shrinking while output is growing. Developers had to adapt or get left behind. So why exactly do PMs think they're exempt from that same pressure?\n\nThe traditional PM toolkit, the methodologies, the ceremonies, all the frameworks we learned and got certified in, needs serious revision. Most of it was built for a world where coordination was expensive and information moved slowly. AI has collapsed that cost almost entirely. When an AI agent can summarize a standup, flag risks from commit history, generate status reports on its own, and keep stakeholders informed in real time, what exactly is the PM doing that justifies the seat at the table?\n\nAnd please, the answer can't just be \"soft skills.\" That's become a crutch at this point. The real answer has to be genuine strategic value. Making judgment calls when things are ambiguous. Actually understanding the product and the business deeply enough to challenge decisions. Navigating messy client relationships. Knowing a project is heading off a cliff before the metrics catch up. That's real PM value. But getting there means growing way beyond the mechanical coordinator role.\n\nI'm not saying we all disappear overnight. What I am saying is that the profession needs to evolve and it needs to happen fast. The PMs who will do well are the ones using AI right now to kill their own busywork and reinvesting that freed up time into thinking at a higher level. The ones who keep repeating \"AI is just a tool, it can't replace the human element\" without actually expanding what that human element looks like in practice? Those are the ones who'll find out the hard way.\n\nJust my two cents from someone working in software delivery who watches this play out every single day. If you don't agree with me just check out this thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1r89spm/spent\\_my\\_entire\\_day\\_updating\\_a\\_board\\_nobody/](https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1r89spm/spent_my_entire_day_updating_a_board_nobody/)",

AI and automation in general can handle many standardised activities regardless of course. \n\nIf all your current PM role covers is repetitive administrative work then sure, you’d be right to be worried. That’s the easy side of PM though, and what most people think we do all day. It’s the same reason why the same people think we’re replaceable - they don’t appreciate what the job actually demands and what the hardest parts of it actually are: people.",

For most PMs, and I include myself in this, it's the majority. Status updates, board maintenance, chasing people for updates, writing reports, scheduling. That stuff fills the calendar. The strategic judgment calls and the empathetic client conversations, those happen what, a few times a month?\n\nSo when that majority of your week gets automated, what happens? Maybe you don't get replaced entirely. Maybe your company just doesn't need four PMs anymore. Maybe they need one who actually does the strategic stuff you're describing and lets AI handle the rest. That's not \"AI can't replace us.\" That's \"AI will replace most of us.\"\n\nAnd about the \"wheel out ChatGPT to explain to a client why you burned a month of budget\" scenario. Sure, a human has to be accountable. But that's one conversation. That's one moment. You don't get to justify an entire role and salary because once a quarter you have a hard conversation. Accountability isn't a full time job. It's a responsibility that sits on top of everything else, and if the everything else is gone, the math stops working in your favor.\n\nAlso the whole \"AI works best in stable environments\" argument was true maybe two years ago. These tools are evolving at a pace that most people in our field are not paying attention to because they're too busy updating boards and attending ceremonies.\n\nI'm not saying soft skills don't matter. I'm saying they're not enough to justify a position if that's ALL you bring. The PMs who will be fine are the ones who combine those human skills with actual strategic thinking, technical understanding, and the ability to deliver outcomes, not just manage process. The ones who just keep saying \"but empathy\" without evolving everything else around it are going to have a rough few years.",

Regardless of whether or not it *can* replace us, c-suite certainly thinks it can, and they make those decisions. \n\n\nNow, there are some caveats here. \n\n\nIn capital projects, I don't see much changing soon. Construction, defense, etc PjMs will be fine for a long time. \n\n\n\nSecondly, even though the *capabilities* are increasing quickly, the speed of uptake is still relatively slow. While software companies are making the switch, banks, CPGs, retail headquarters - these places are slow to adopt. Hell, I work at what is ostensibly a software company and a lot of what I do could be replaced with an Asana subscription and a couple of good Slack connectors, let alone AI. It takes months or even years for us to onboard new software, so change is slow. Companies will take awhile to catch up. \n\n\nThirdly, all of these tools rely on good data. While models are getting better and better at handling complexity, for these tools to work, everyone needs to do *their* job. They need document standardization, knowledge management... They need to update their trackers or tell their trackers to update themselves, etc. If real people really did this regularly, project and program management would have mostly died with MS Project. Yet, here we are. \n\n\nSo while I think we are absolutely going by the wayside, there will be a few year gap, and some of us will stick around. But there will be far fewer of us, and none at all in certain industries, I suspect. ",

Slack is the only common denominator so that's where cross functional coordination happens. And it's a disaster.\n\nLaunch requires engineering to finish the feature, design to create launch assets, marketing to write messaging, sales to train on positioning. Each team is managing their part in their own tools (Jira, Figma, HubSpot, Salesforce) but the dependencies between teams all live in random Slack threads.\n\nDesigner says \"waiting on final specs from engineering\" in Slack. Engineering finished specs yesterday but posted in a different channel. Designer doesn't see it, asks again 3 days later. Engineering is like \"we already posted it\" but now they have to re-explain where. Meanwhile marketing is blocked waiting on assets from design.\n\nThe handoffs between teams are where everything falls apart because Slack is terrible for tracking dependencies. Everyone is doing their part but nobody has visibility into the critical path so we don't realize we're off track until the launch date arrives and we're not ready.\n\nTried using project management software but getting 4 different teams to all maintain the same tool is impossible. Engineering wants Jira, design wants Notion, marketing wants Asana. So PM tool becomes my personal tool that nobody else touches.",

Because that's how so many of us got burnt out and went independent. \n\nOf lates, though, here in the USSA I'm dealing with an entirely different bullshit PITA problem. \n\nI went back and checked some notes in an ancient notebook, and confidently state that in this, the Year of Our Lord 2026, vendors take longer to respond to RFQs and RFPs than they did when we had to use telephones, FAXes, and the post office to get biz done. \n\nExample: A packaging manufacturer of specialty glass for medical devices would turn a quote request in 2 weeks in the early '90s. I'm 4 weeks out now, and they are making excuses and asking for two more weeks. \n\nExample: A custom corrugated company that I've used for a long time used to flip quotes around in 3 to 5 days. Now I'm waiting 2 weeks or 3 for the same information. \n\nExample: A material reprocessor that I've used a few times over the last ten years used to quote in 2 weeks. Now they require 4. \n\nCommon denominator: Thanks to Raygun's successful demolition of the Sherman Antitrust Act, each of the companies I mentioned has been rolled up into every larger companies and then finally merged into huge single-owner Private Equity nightmares. Ferinstance, there used to be about 50 distributors from which I could source packaging for medical devices and cosmetics. There are now 3, and for shits and giggles they've also locked the direct sourcing option out through contractual means.  \n\nIt ain't the people at the companies. They've just been reduced, right sized, reorganized, and de-skilled to the point that they can't do the job. I expect in the next round of \"efficiency\" the last skilled humans will be replaced with an AI chatbot. \n\nAnyway, my friends in China can get a complex device fully quoted in a week or two. Germany might take a few more. I'm *two* fucking months into trying to get numbers for a simple line of cosmetics. \n\nThank you for attending my TED Rant. \n\nAnybody else losing hair around these delays? \n\n",

This comes back to the understanding of roles and responsibilities of your stakeholder but there is a caveat, if the meeting is to propose any changes to the project's triple constraint of time, cost and scope, then discretion is needed or at the very least have the meeting minuted with the decisions, actions or outcomes clearly documented. \n\nAs the PM you're not expected to know the ins and outs of every task, work package, product or deliverable (hence, roles and responsibilities) however you do need to be aware on how they impact the schedule. E.g. if you have a senior technical lead, it's their responsibility to develop and design and ensure the technical delivery,  you as the PM are responsible for the quality of the delivery and ensuring that it's fit for purpose e.g. using test/use case, applying quality assurances against the deliverable, work package or product etc. \n\nIf you were to attend every project's side meeting there won't be enough hours in the week for you to do your job, let alone attending meetings that you're not needed for. As you become more seasoned as a project practitioner you start to learn which meetings you should or shouldn't be attending. I would also start contacting the meeting chairs and ask if you indeed needed to be there and why. As a personal preference I set very clear expectations if there is no agenda and an open invite I don't attend and especially if the meeting has been set for an hour or more.   \n\nIf someone wants to call a meeting, it's their responsibility to ensure that A) the meeting is warranted B) the relevant stakeholders are invited and ensure there is a quorum that is able to make decisions if needed C) The meeting must have an agenda (NOTE: this is where significant project costs can be incurred when meetings don't have an agenda and it becomes a talk fest with no real outcomes) D) the meeting must be  minuted. You need to make those responsible to take responsibility, as the PM you don't carry everything. \n\nJust an armchair perspective. ",

Your last consideration is potentially looking at vocational training in order to assist you or even reaching out to your vendors for vendor training. \n\nAlso look at your training plan as part of your performance review, if that is if you have one. As mentioned you need to be actively managing yourself and not being a passenger on the bus because you will not learn or mature as a valued employee and that leaves you exposed on a number of different levels. \n\nJust an armchair perspective  ",

      "text": "I started a new role as a Project Lead on February 17th. It’s a two pay grade promotion with a solid base salary increase, and I recently earned my PMP, so this felt like a huge career milestone for me.\n\nI’ve been assigned to a large project consolidating five different software systems into one enterprise-wide platform. There are multiple workstreams tied to each system, like HR, finance, reporting, etc. I’m the lead for the finance workstream.\n\nHere’s where it gets tricky.\n\nThe finance workstream technically started about four to six months ago. They were waiting on approval to officially hire and assign project leads to each workstream, which is why I’m just now coming in. Two other new leads will also be starting soon.\n\nThe gentleman who has been running the finance workstream up to this point has never had a project lead. He told me we’ll figure out what “my role” looks like as we go. I understand that some clarity takes time. I’m not expecting everything to be perfectly defined in week one.\n\nBut right now, I’m being treated like an administrative assistant rather than a project lead.\n\nI’m being asked to run Zoom AI Companion during meetings, organize and distribute notes, schedule workshops that are already fully structured with titles, attendees, and homework assignments defined. Basically execution support tasks, not leadership or strategic oversight.\n\nNone of my performance objectives include admin work. They’re focused on delivery, stakeholder alignment, risk management, governance, and outcomes. I worked hard for this promotion and certification. I did not step into this role to manage meeting minutes.\n\nTo add another layer, my direct manager is not part of this project. She already warned me that another project lead on a different workstream is not being utilized appropriately and told me to make sure I escalate if needed. So I know I’m not crazy for sensing this might become a pattern.\n\nOn top of that, the workstream lead has already made it clear he prefers people in the office and isn’t thrilled that I’m home based. That’s not changing. My role is remote eligible and that was part of the agreement.  I’ve worked remote since 2009 and it has never interfered with my performance.\n\nIt’s been a bit of a crushing first week. I’m already feeling anxious about tomorrow, which is not how I expected to feel stepping into a promotion I was excited about.\n\nI’m planning to address role clarity directly in our next meeting and align expectations to my stated objectives, but I want to do it professionally and early before this dynamic sets in permanently.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar, especially stepping into a project midstream where someone has been operating without formal structure? How did you establish authority and role clarity without coming across as territorial or difficult?\n\nWould appreciate any advice.",

Learn about the project.   Get to know the team including the arrogant chauvinist.  Continue having conversations and doing your research about your role, but do so from a position of “how I can help the workstream and project” and not, “why is nobody respecting my new title?”.       \n\nYou also don’t want the current workstream lead to say, “ok, you want to be in charge?

When I applied for the PL role, I expected to be declined due to my pay grade, but I have my PMP, which was required, so I took a chance.  It’s not common for employees to be hired for a role two grades above at our company. I was shocked I was picked to interview. I figured it was just to “get the #s” so they could meet candidates criteria and offer to someone else waiting in the pipeline already. So when they contacted to offer the role I was floored - two above my grade = good promotion & increase in pay (not common in our firm at all). \n\nThe person I’m concerned with isn’t being replaced, he is a main stakeholder of six in my matrix team that I will be leading - he is a top leader in finance so he working in the workstream.  He will remain in the workstream in the planning, sprints, and working on the granular technical things I would not customarily be involved in. Yet, I’m being asked to be in all of these meetings to take notes, run zoom, launch AI compaction, send out notes and PowerPoints after meetings… things that an admin would do.  I spoke to another lead (not mentioning what I was being asked to do) and they are deep in strategic transition and planning. I asked if they scheduled all the workshops and what not and she said “nope, that’s nope our scope of work as a lead.” \n\nTrying to be optimistic, but I’m REALLY good at reading people and can figure someone out pretty quickly- and I’m rarely wrong about a person. So I am hesitant knowing my gut is telling me I’m stepping into a role with a strong male personality who seems to be pretty … hate to say- arrogant, and maybe even a bit chauvinistic.  He literally said in a meeting Friday to a young female offshore contractor “looks like you’re ready to go clubbing and be off this call cause you’re all dressed up, unlike your usual” - it was 9p where she was and 9am for us. She didn’t seem enthused by his comment. I felt bad for her. Of course, I don’t know their working relationship, but I could read the zoom room when it was said. \n\nI will def take your advice and try to work backwards to find answers to the points you’ve brought up. I guess he just really rubbed me the wrong way on my first week. Now I’m laying here wide awake worried when I’d usually be asleep two hours by now.",

Has a conversation been had with them about what your role is, or are you *both* making assumptions? Because probably this stakeholder hasn't thought about this at all, or at least I find that it almost always the case. \n\n\nThe other thing that springs to mind is, what strategic transition and planning needs to be happening that someone one week into the role would be doing instrad of what you are doing now? This is where the transition plan comes in. It takes time to onboard and hand off a project, especially as a leader. \n\n\n>  I’m REALLY good at reading people and can figure someone out pretty quickly- \n\n\nThis is a red flag to me.\n\n\nBut regardless, even if it is true, you can't handle this stakeholder from that point of view. Dismissing or making assumptions or setting your behavior about the stakeholder because of a vibe, even if that is 100% true, is a recipe for failure. Unfortunately, we have to work with shitty people all the time. Put that energy toward figuring out how to work with this person, regardless of whether they suck. One key to that is to figure out where they are coming from and why. \n\n\nBut, for the record, admin work is alert of the job. No, I usually wouldn't do it for a functional team's workshops or what have you, but I still own that work for the project or program's operating rhythm. Explaining the difference is often something j have to do, so best to come up with a script for it now. You'll be using it a lot in your career! ",

It's a one pager that outlines a project overview and objectives (5), deliverable milestones (5) and the top five issues and risks in bullet point or those that need their immediate action, it can just be all bullet point overviews. I would also request a 1:1 meeting to provide any contextual Q & A's in relation to your top 5 paper (give them the option). I have found this approach very effective for both the stakeholder and myself because it allows me to set the tone and outline my expectations (yes I do that with senior stakeholders) and the stakeholder to outline theirs. But that is just me and how I operate.  \n\nJust an armchair perspective. ",

I am just stuck and I cannot even leave this project.\n\nNow, the director also wants me to present updates to clients everyday ones the project starts which is in a week or two.\n\nI feel like I need to work a lot on myself to meet all this. How to work on this, what is the kind of mindset that I need to change to, to get on pace. \n\nCan any seniors/superiors here help and guide me for sometime. I really need some help to get used to this.\n\nThey are also starting some training for one of the functional modules.\n\nHow do I go by all this. What tools/work/process should I follow.",

No action, call them out during a meeting.\n2. Excel pivot tables are not that hard, enough walkthroughs online or go to a platform like Udemy for a course. It will cost you an evening of Xbox but you'll become an Excel [wizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHc7bR6y06M).\n3. People will sometimes get dissapointed with you, get married, you will get used to it. Deal with it. Just try to do better. If you get fired you will find another job, do not get too emotionally attached.\n4. Work efficiently, find a default format for emails, for reporting etc. Create an Excel that formats data so you can easily copy/paste the data in the other tools/trackers etc.\n5. Work with a todo list, in the morning write down what you will have to and mark a tasks as done, you will get that feeling of accomplishment, plus you can show your superiors what you did today/this week/this month etc.\n\nYou will get there!",

The expectation that you learn this in a few days is either ignorant or at best your superiors see a lot of potential in you and think you can manage. \n\nIn either case, I would hang in there. Rally up support as I said earlier, focus on what you can do, do your best, try to set boundaries where possible, just be overall reasonable and don't get sucked in by the overwhelm. In 6 months from now, when the project is over, you'll have learned a ton and all the discomfort will be forgotten.

You should voice that you feel you have a heavy workload and the demand on what you're doing seems high.

Do you have a defined scope of work? Are you familiar with what product or services you are delivering to the client? What the major components or milestones are? Is there a signed contract you can review? Start there. You need to know the what. \n\nThen find out if there is a project communication plan and stakeholder register. If these artifacts do no exist see if you can, get your hands on ones from similar projects. \n\nFigure out the project plan. Again is there an existing one or can you copy one? If this is waterfall, once you have the plan, execute against it. Get familiar with a RAID log and keep one. Find out who is making decisions on the project (make a RACI if it will be useful). \n\nIf none of these artifacts exist and your leadership do not support you in creating them and defining scope, etc. then you have an organizational problem. If you are a PM you are not a go-for and you're not admin assistant. You may want to make sure that you're not failing in expectations in part due to the fact that the org does not know what a PM is or is misleading you. \n\n\nIn my experience, as a PM you often work with Directors, VPs and Execs so you have to get comfortable with that. They will make decisions, provide resources and clear blockers. You need them on your team. There can be quite a bit of politics involved.",

Also also, if you set up VScode with a 10$ github co-pilot subscription, you can plop the excel in a work folder, tell a.i what the file is (explain the fields). Then tell it to code what a program that does what you need! ",

      "text": "Good afternoon to anyone reading this. I’m sharing my experience to hopefully stop someone else from making the same mistake I did during my first Gov Contract Role:\n\nI’ve worked as a Project Coordinator and Junior Project Manager for about five years in Film, Tech, and Healthcare, mostly with NGOs. After seeing former classmates succeed with IT staffing firms, I uploaded my resume to many platforms like Dice.com. For over a year, recruiters reached out but nothing came of it. I eventually landed my current role through a traditional hiring process.\n\nAbout a month into that job, a recruiter contacted me again and I allowed them to represent me. Days later, I received multiple excited calls saying I’d been selected for interviews. I completed two rounds (Teams, then in person) for a Technical Project Manager role and quickly received an offer. With my JIRA Agile certification and location, things moved fast.\n\nThe offer was life-changing: six figures and aligned perfectly with my plan to earn my PMP this year. A very thorough background check followed—schools, employers, references, certifications, DMV—the works. The process lasted nearly three months, during which I continued working my current job while onboarding on breaks. I also negotiated limited PTO and paid holidays, which I was comfortable with given the salary.\n\nHERE’S WHERE EVERYTHING WENT WRONG\n\nBefore a required Non-DOT drug screening, the recruiter asked if I used anything recreationally. I told her I used THC on weekends and lived in Virginia, where it’s decriminalized. She assured me this would not be an issue.\n\nTHIS WAS MY BIGGEST MISTAKE\n\nI had never taken a 7-panel drug test or worked with a government-contracted company. What I didn’t research myself was that the client held federal contracts and followed federal zero-tolerance policies for Schedule I substances, regardless of state law. Trusting the recruiter, I abstained briefly (3 weeks) took the test, and thought nothing of it.\n\nA week later, an MRO informed me my sample contained trace THC. I explained the Non-DOT status and state legality, but they clarified the company followed federal policy. I panicked. The recruiter’s entire team became involved, admitted they hadn’t fully understood the client’s policy, and immediately scheduled a second test. I fully abstained and passed.\n\nDespite advocacy from the recruiter and my would-be manager, the company enforced a strict rule: any positive result during onboarding meant automatic offer rescission—even with a subsequent negative test. The offer was pulled.\n\nI wrote an emotional appeal to HR, but they were firm. DOT and VDOT later confirmed I wasn’t federally regulated as a Non-DOT employee, but that only meant company policy applied—and this company had zero tolerance and no rehabilitation exceptions.\n\nThe job was gone.\n\nWHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE: Never rely solely on a recruiter’s assurances. They aren’t bad people, but they are salespeople. If something isn’t explicitly confirmed in writing, verify it yourself. I trusted vague answers instead of doing my own research—and paid the price.\n\nI fell hard but eventually recovered. I had to humble myself to get my old job back, but I’m sharing this to help others protect themselves. We work too hard for our education and certifications to lose opportunities over assumptions. Verify everything—use Google, ChatGPT, anything—before making life-changing decisions.\n\nI’m embarrassed and disappointed, but I’m only 27, and it’s not over. One thing is certain: I will never fail another 7-panel drug test again.\n\nThank you for your time,",
