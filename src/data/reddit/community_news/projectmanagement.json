Every time I ask someone how they do something the answer is \"it depends\" followed by fifteen edge cases, stuff that's supposedly standardized has three different versions depending on who you ask, and critical knowledge lives entirely in the heads of people who could leave tomorrow.\n\nThe scary part is we function fine day to day but if certain people left we'd be scrambling to figure out how basic things even work. Anyone else realized how fragile their operations actually are when you look closely at them?",

There's less to document because the system is the documentation, if that makes sense. Same thing with our intake forms in typeform, the form itself defines what information we collect so there's no \"it depends on who answers\" variation anymore. Harder with judgment based tasks obviously but for the routine repetitive stuff, picking a tool and letting it enforce the process eliminated a ton of tribal knowledge that was impossible to write down anyway.\n\n  \n",

The best pm’s I’ve worked with take the time and make the effort to understand the mission, then build the project accordingly. That means the project is structured in a way that fits their style of project management. No one is ever going to be more across the needs of a project than the pm, so if they’re forced into a process that doesn’t suit their style or the needs of the project then things will fall apart fast.\n\nTLDR: Establishing processes can provide useful guidelines, but they can also stymie the work of good pm’s and create a false sense of security for bad pm’s and management. There are often good reasons why certain processes are not set in stone and why some pm’s and some projects do things differently.",

It depends is the sound of undocumented decision trees, and three different versions means process drift with no governance. You're not behind schedule, you're doing archaeology.\n\n**What's actually happening**: Your processes evolved organically (which works) but never got codified (which doesn't scale). People built workarounds, edge cases became standard practice, and no one had authority or time to reconcile the versions. Now you're trying to document a living system that's still mutating.\n\n**Framework to tame this (without hiring consultants):**\n\nStop trying to document everything at once\n\nPrioritize by risk: What breaks if \\[key person\\] leaves tomorrow? Start there. Document the top 5 critical processes first, then expand.\n\nUse the **decision tree** method for **it depends** answers\n\nWhen someone says **it depends**, ask: What are you checking to decide?\n\nMap it as: IF \\[condition\\], THEN \\[action\\]. ELSE \\[alternative action\\].\n\nExample:\n\nIF client is under contract, THEN route to Account Manager\n\nELSE IF inbound lead, THEN route to Sales\n\nELSE route to Support\n\nCreate a **source of truth owner** for each process\n\nAssign one person as the authority for each process. When versions conflict, that person decides. Update the doc, notify the team, archive old versions.\n\n**Build a process changelog**\n\nEvery time a process changes, log: What changed | Why | Who approved | Date\n\nThis prevents I thought we still did it the old way confusion.\n\n**Run a knowledge transfer audit**\n\nList your top 10 critical processes. For each, ask: If \\[owner\\] left, who could do this? If the answer is no one, that's your red flag list.  If you'd like some additional ideas, I'm happy to share.",

I still manually take notes, but the AI captures more robust information since it can transcribe faster than I can type. I also cannot type and employ active listening at the same time; the note taker allows me to pay attention to what's being said so I can get a full understanding with context.\n\n\nThe GPT has a project folder and generic project knowledge instructions. In the knowledge base, I include all relevant project documents, like the scope of work, past reports, past work, and a report template.\n\n\nMy team gives detailed updates in their trackers: every stakeholder interaction, every project status change, every iteration of a project, tasks, points of contact, etc. You get the idea: if it can be defined, quantified, classified, or described, my team includes it as a variable or an update in the tracker.\n\n\nFor each report, I export all data from the tracker as Excel or .csv and upload it to my GPT. I prompt the GPT to create a report based on the template, and tell it to include all requirements for the report from the scope of work.\n\n\nI compare the output from the GPT to my tracker and note taker's notes. I, the human, manually add any risks, context, or notes I took from daily interactions. I remove hallucinations or anything stupid the GPT included. After some formatting and proofreading, I fire that puppy off to the project owner. \n\n\nCaveat: This application of AI is highly dependent on my teams putting detailed updates in their trackers; my having precise instructions in my prompts, clear project instructions, and the experience and emotional intelligence to identify threats, challenges, and risks that my team is too junior to identify as such.",

Weekly timesheets is good periodicity synchronized with status input. \n\nActual costs come from accounting into PM through an API and show up as actual costs (AC). The baseline in PM and status show earned value (EV). The baseline shows planned value (PV). I report this as CPI and SPI with LOE tasks excluded. \n\nOn contracts with progress payments instead of periodic (usually monthly) billing I get and include two other artifacts. First is AC v. billing as a line graph. If the customer is slow pay we add a \"paid\" line. I get reports from accounting of outstanding invoices (ours to customers and vendors to us). Second is a report of incomplete tasks to the next two progress payments. \n\nThe data flows from accounting to one of my BAs who generates reporting to me and for outgoing reporting. Everyone gets the same information. No tailored reporting. The BA has spreadsheet templates formatted to look like the ones from the PM tool to avoid confusion. Accounting provides data as .xlsx files. It's all very automated so work is in analysis, not generation. We also get an allocated cost from finance for interest charges for running costs (labor and expenses) from our corporate line of credit that shows up as a charge in our data from accounting through the API. If we see something big (big materials usually) on the horizon we generate an exception report as a heads up to finance. \n\nPM tools I've had this work with include MS Project, Scitor Project Scheduler (RIP), and Primavera. The new generation of PM \"tools\" are deficient. I have yet to encounter an accounting tool (or HRIS for that matter) without good API support. \n\nMS Project doesn't scale well when project size gets exponential, say 10 x 10^(7) USD. \\*grin\\* \n\nIn my experience, building systems to avoid duplicate data entry and for the long term is worth marginal cost in capex to minimize opex. Remember - all this stuff (except my BA) is overhead. \n\nDave's rant #374: Software can't do your job for you. You have to know what you're doing. \n\nPM, SE, accounting, finance, HR, IT, and legal form a team. We meet as needed (no periodic meetings - as needed) when anyone sees a bump in the road. We have an email distribution list as most bumps can be avoided through communication. If accounting software is getting an upgrade we all know. If some SaaS contract (ugh) is being renewed we all know. If HR is responding to new reporting requirements that change data formats we all know.

I would suggest setting up a standard template and all you have to do is import your relevant data stores for analysis. In the past I have even been able to automate the raw data imports for MS Excel. \n\nTo be perfectly frank, a PM should be doing their own import and data manipulation in order to find micro tends in the data e.g. a task or work package supposedly being finished because you see time attributed but no deliverable, or you can start baselining tasks or work packages for future projects etc. It's also a skill that a PM must possess in knowing how to complete a trend analysis on forecast and actuals. \n\nAlso another consideration, forecast and actuals is not considered a realtime transactions because the forecast is a future state and actuals is a past state because you record the effort or expenditure after the fact. Also it's highly unlikely you will have resources submitting daily timesheets, your finance team providing you financial transactions against your project and you running a report after these transactions have occurred, it's not feasible to conceive that project transactions can be measured in realtime. \n\nThe reality is that a PM is the stop gap for decentralised information and every PM must have the skills to be able to assimilate, analyse and disseminate the disparate data stores in order to understand how their project is truely performing against the schedule and must be considered your primary quality indicator. Off loading through automation (which I've seen many PM's wanting to do) runs the risk of really not understanding how your project is truly progressing and performing. ",

Transparency builds trust. They don’t want to hear it but you don’t want to backtrack later. \n\nI inherited a project where promises were made by my predecessor that never happened. I explained that I couldn’t do anything about that now but here we are today. I provided a plan going forward and gave them timelines. I looked at it as it not being my fault for our current situation. It helped and things got done. I built trust with them and I was thanked later for my guidance. \n\nThat was as a new PM working in data center construction. The pace there was fast, and we had half of the team my company promised, but we had a couple engineers who were all stars. I was stressed out daily. It was stressful but we met the deadline in the end with some caveats. \n\nYour customers will respect your transparency more than you trying to fix things behind the scenes. Rip the bandaid off and get the issues out there. They will be more helpful with that approach after the initial shock wears off. In the meantime, if possible, talk to your management about getting more people to work on the project. Maybe they can do something, maybe not but you’ve got to up-channel the things that keep you up at night. Otherwise, it’s self-induced stress until you relieve the weight on your shoulders.\n\nPrepare for longer days if that’s an option. Plan *with* your team, not just for them. Let them know what’s going on. It makes that part easier as well. It builds trust when everyone knows where things sit.",

Let me add a comment, though, OP, in case you see this before your next client-facing meeting.\n\nEveryone telling you to alert the client to the problem are right,  You definitely should do that, after telling your leadership about the situation and your messaging approach.\n\nBefore doing either, however, I would advise going thru another round of what-ifs to determine what, if anything, your org and suppliers could possibly do to reduce the schedule.  Can your client pay more to your org, to pay your suppliers to crash the schedule?  If your suppliers are late, can other suppliers meet the (or at least get closer to) the original schedule?\n\nEven if your suppliers can’t do anything, and alternative suppliers can’t be used for whatever reason, can your org crash the schedule in other ways (e.g. bring in contractors to reduce timelines later?). \n\nAlternatively, can your org deliver less at first, then iteratively deliver the rest of the solution?\n\nLong story short: We typically work with three constraints.  The schedule is currently cooked.  Work with your teams and leadership to determine what, if anything can be done if the client can pay more or reduce the scope needed by the deadline.  Look for alternatives and present what you find and let the client determine what’s really most important in the triple constraint.",

You also need to map your relevant project document artefacts to see if they have been delivered, reviewed and approved.  This is to ensure that you're not getting a dead cat that is being thrown over the fence and making sure that you're left holding the cat. \n\nAnything that falls short should be immediately escalated to your project board, sponsor or executive. You also should be raising additional risks and issues and informally socialise them with your project board then formally raise them, so they're not surprised. I would also suggest you have a plan for a way forward e.g re-baselining your project schedule, placing the project on hold or worse case scenario  recommend abandonment.  \n\nYourself, your executive or account manager (urgently) need to sit down with the client in order to reset expectations because if you don't do anything outlined above it will end up in your lap at the end of the project, rightly or wrongly.

      "text": "For the past year I have worked as a junior project manager in SaaS company. Mind you, there is no senior PM in the company but since I came in fresh in the role with little to no actual previous experience I have been titled as Junior. \n\nThe CEO of the company moonlights as a dev with just enough knowledge to be more of a hindrance rather than useful. For the past year he has been building products with the help of AI coding assistants and then offloading thousands of lines of code to the dev team to sort out and transform fit for production. From the very beginning requirements gathering has been non existent. Market research, client needs… these are like curse words in our company. CEO has an idea. He vibe-codes it for a month and then leaves a steaming pile of mess for the rest of the team to sort out. We scramble for days to make sense of it and then over the weekend he drops a v2 of his initial product and the scrambling begins all over again. Last year we spent more than 8 dev months on a product, we managed to onboard one client and now it’s getting decommissioned in favor of his newest idea. \n\nFor one of our other products I tried to bring structure into it, established a timeline, he went on the Sales team chat, said the product is “ready” and they can put client on it. I piped in to say that internal testing isn’t finished, we have 4 more weeks on the timeline and I wouldn’t define the product as “ready”. For which I got a chewing directly from the CEO that I “need to understand my role better” and that I can’t keep blocking sales. Which, I swallowed as feedback and rolled with it. The problem is that, 2 days later he was supposed to demo this specific product to a prospective client and some things didn’t work as expected. Then I got another chewing that “this is badly broken and whatever testing plan you put in place was clearly inadequate”. That’s the point I checked out of the job and nowadays I just do the bare minimum. \n\nIt’s hard to put a testing plan together - I don’t have QA testers, I have no requirements, and every time I mention “acceptance criteria” he looks at me like I just cursed his mothers. \n\nI’m allowed to ask him concrete questions on priorities but I have to “spare him the general chitchat” \n\nSales team have meetings with prospective clients, they pass down client needs and market gaps that need filling and I prioritise features based on that. On the next morning, CEO completely overturns priorities because he just spoke to one client and that one client absolutely has to have that one feature this instant. \n\nOn one morning standup he tells me “prioritise this project” and I do - assign resources, draw timelines to the best of my ability, try and chase him to sign off on the plan. And then I learn that 2 out of the 3 resources I assigned have been pulled in other “urgent tasks” and my timeline gets delayed by certain amount of time. And then I get blamed for the delays and insufficient planning. Head of Engineering chewed me once in front of the whole dev+sales team for putting in buffers in my timelines and how that’s misleading and “hurting transparent communication between departments” \n\nMy dev team is just spitting out code to the bare minimum of standards because they are tired of the mess. \n\nWhen I try to enforce change control the CEO goes behind my back straight to devs and wrested them into doing what they want. \n\nMVP is a dirty word and “we can’t expect to turn a profit selling people the bare minimum”. \n\nAnd on and on I can talk about the inadequacy of the whole company. \n\nI have tried all kinds of approaches to stabilise things. But for most of the time nobody listens to me or follows the processes I try to implement - I have been undermined so many times, I have no real authority or voice anymore. \n\nI don’t manage projects - I scramble to write documentation after the fact. I sit in awkward calls where I have to tell stakeholders that what they see demoed in the CEO’s local environment is really nowhere near an accurate representation of the current status of the project. \n\nHow do you deal with a situation like this? I’m burnt out and lost all motivation to try and change things. I’m ready to throw in the towel but can’t afford to remain without a job at the moment. So any coping mechanisms and suggestions would be very very appreciated ",

Plans reflect conversations not conversations about plans. Have the current plan in a simple visual format ready to go whenever a conversation turns to an impact on the plan, show the picture and ask for a decision on trade-offs.\n\nKeep spamming the plan into slack, consider having your own channel for and forward it to other channels.

Which says something about what we've normalised.\n\nI spent 20 plus years in enterprise programme delivery. Somewhere along the way I noticed I'd stopped being happy for colleagues. A peer would land a great assignment and my first thought was \"why not me?\" Someone would share a win and I'd feel nothing. Or worse — a flicker of resentment.\n\nNot because I'm a bad person. Because the environment had trained it out of me. Years of zero-sum recognition, political promotion, and cultures where success is invisible but failure follows you for years.\n\nThe dangerous part is how slowly it happens. You don't notice the erosion. You just wake up one day and realise you can't remember the last time you felt genuinely happy about someone else's success.\n\nAnyone else noticed this in themselves?\n",

I don’t doubt they have a lot of work that could be done, but he’s actively managing a lot less work than other coworkers of similar skills/tenure. He also publicly talks badly of his boss, and anyone else around him that doesn’t give him slack.  He’s in general unwilling to communicate his problems to find a resolve and doesn’t seem able to manage his time or emotions. \n\nI have been slowly onboarding into the role, primarily assisting with other projects currently underway and recently received my first three full time projects. Along with projects I also work on quoting future projects for labor and materials. \n\nThe issue is due to the aforementioned engineer being his own worst enemy, he tends to mail things in without looking into them as he should. Now, my PMO team I’m now working with is not a strong PMO team and also has been stretched thin over the last year. They haven’t been checking bill of materials like they should leading to a surge of internal (ie non-billable) request forms being filled out for replacement materials.\n\nI happened to catch over 30 missing items on a BOM for a repeat build, that was missed on the BOM. AND- it was also missing on the previous BOM from the same engineer. Why? Because he didn’t review the change request forms from the previous project. \n\nHe’s now very upset with me that I dared bring this up and actually asked him to fix the issue, and not continue to kick the can down the road. He tried to continue to kick the can down the road, but I had a hard deadline and eventually had to loop in his boss. The boss he hates. \n\nQuestion posed: how do you work with stakeholders who are their own worst enemies/ don’t get things done? I fear he’s the kind of worker who will not improve ever- so, building a relationship with him and giving him tools may not be effective. I’m okay with not being liked by him. He’s not especially likable to be honest. However, I worry him expressly disliking me will harm his ability to get work done. Advice? Thoughts?",

And these people all have feelings about yiu, your project, their workload, the company... everything. And those feelings can impact the project work.\n\nWhat's worked for me is that I \"mirror\" what I hear from them - to make them feel understood and to gain trust and a path to a successful working relationship. I usually try to get them on their own, and I'll start off with something like, \"So, Bob, how do you feel about our project? How do you feel about what you'll have to deliver?\" Notice I didn't ask him what he THOUGHT, but how he FELT. I take the time and give them the space to gripe... and I listen.\n\nI've learned a lot from people when I do this. One guy's coworker had quit, and he was trying to figure out fhow to juggle all the extra work. One young, new supervisor was a real bltch, and I found out it wss her first project, and she was afraid of failing because it had a lot of visibility.\n\nAnd then I let them know that I'm concerned - that I'm worried about them. And I ask them if they see any way I can help. Sometimes I can (maybe help get an additional resource assigned or create an extra report to track the project, for example). But I communicate that I care about their issues.... and that I know we both want the project to go well. And I ask them how I can help.\n\nI do this on a continuous basis throughout my projects. I keep asking people how thet FEEL, because that's a much better barometer of how things are going than if you ask them what they THINK. You'll hear that they're stressed or overworked or whatever, but your job is to assist however yoh can and to BUILD TRUST. Trust gains cooperation. If people like you, that gains cooperation, too.\n\nIt's a really rare thing that I have to bring out the \"big guns.\" I really don't need to. And if you polish your skills on how to build trust, how to develop relationships, and how to help people solve THEIR problems (not just have them solve yours) your projects will be much more successful.\n\nGood luck.",

          "text": "The reality of being a project manager is that you can't be worried about what people think of you and over the years I have worked with many people as you have described and being in IT it would be fair to say when it comes to engineers you get to deal with some big egotistical personalities, especially when you start working in the enterprise space.\n\nThe way I approach these types of situations is I first have an informal 1:1 meeting and discuss the impact of their behaviour and how they affect project delivery (I always have supporting facts to highlight, so to not make it or have it perceived as an personal attack) what you outline is the impact of their behaviour and outline their responsibilities. You need to convey your expectation of what is and isn't acceptable behaviour to you as  you're the person who is responsible for delivering the project.\n\nYour next step if there is no change to the behaviour is to document and present to their immediate manager, highlight the impact of the individual's behaviour (again with verified facts) but this is where you start outlining the type of costs the project is incurring e.g days lost, time lost, additional unscheduled project costs but where you focus in on is the organisational reputational risk to the company and how this individual behaviour passes through to the client.\n\nIf you still don't get any assistance in the management of the unacceptable behaviour then you need to escalate through to your project board, sponsor or executive. This is the drawback from a PM perspective, because you don't own the resource you can't HR manage the individual. All you can do is highlight the unprofessional behaviour and the risks and impact of the individual's behaviour. Based upon my experience over the years sometimes you do need to have to have confrontation or conflict resolution management intervention, for me I'm sure as hell not going to be held accountable for someone's unprofessional behaviour but that's a \"me thing\". I've been around the block a few times and to be honest I refuse to accept behaviour like this because I have been really impacted in the pasts because of this type of behaviour and If I had the same attitude as a PM, I wouldn't be very successful and be out of a job very quickly, so why is this individual getting a hall pass?\n\nHere's a reflection point for your consideration, do think that it's fair that this individual isn't held accountable for their actions and you are as the PM? This comes down to the fundamental management skill, holding people accountable for their actions and to be perfectly honest I hold CEO's down to project support staff accountable because that is MY responsibility as a PM.  Good luck and I hope things work out for you.\n\nJust an armchair perspective",

I’m basically both the program AND project manager. My team consists of 3 people that aren’t PM’s.. and have other responsibilities and can help as needed.\n\nI tried asking what their goal is for the full rollout, and they half jokingly said “yesterday”. In addition to keeping track of this pilot, I need to figure out a timeline dependent on other teams for:\n\n\\- A hefty overhaul of procedure updates (est 6 months)\n\n\\- New routing & skill creation (roughly 6 weeks)\n\n\\- Communication plan (March)\n\n\\- Training for both internal & vendors\n\n\\- Forecasting headcount\n\n\\- Partnering with HR to discuss posting a req and planning interviews for existing employees in the org\n\nWhat’s a realistic timeframe to accomplish all of this considering my limited support?\n\nAny advice in general to help me get through this?",

But the real question is... \"Does any of this change anything about the project manager's fundamental responsibilities?\"\n\nI'm leaning toward no.  Enhance deliverables?  Sometimes.  Make some things easier?  Sure.  Change my core responsibilities as a project manager?  That might be a bit of an overstatement.  At least for now, at most companies.\n\nUsed together, they can help you with executive framing, tradeoff analysis, making decision-making easier, etc., which can, eventually, lead to more responsibility and possibly even promotion.  This is advisable even if the opportunities aren't there with your current employer.  What will likely have more impact on a project manager's fundamental responsibilities is changing leadership's attitude toward project managers and what they expect from them.  Once this expectation is changed, the bar is effectively raised.  Until then, the project manager is assuming greater responsibility that the organization might need, but hasn't granted, yet.",

It allows you to work effectively with highly variable and unstructured data. In practice this means less friction when trying to get information out of the team. \n\nFor example, AI can extract the data you need from the teams own reports, written notes, meeting minutes, emails, etc and output in the format you need as a PM. So the team just has to do a quick review of the generated output, saving hours and they will appreciate that you are meeting them where they are. \n\nThat is just the beginning though. Most projects are well defined workflows and that means you can can automate end to end using multi-agents.

Speed up delivery (projects) by examining each element of the project to determine gaps, funnels and roadblocks and designing process solutions to streamline the project. \n\n2. Jumping into a project that is considered “troubled” and figuring out the fastest and most efficient/least cost solution to fix the project and hit the triple constraint. Or at least two of them. \n\n3. When a troubled project continues to devolve, then it can take drastic action to fix it, lest the project becomes “failed” and you risk customer relationships. This is when the original PM begins to reconsider professions and the team realizes that “evenings and weekends” are coming up. Sometimes people say that this is when you “crash” a project. Crashing a project is very intensive review of all ongoing and any remaining tasks to find opportunities to make the work get done faster. Bringing in more people, cutting tasks that risk project success, bringing in cots. Usually referred to as a “death march” project. \n\nI’ve done the first two and they can be fun challenges. I’ve been involved in a death march but not as project management (thank God). It isn’t fun. It isn’t pretty. I got fired over a conference call when I pointed out that a project was hitting the lacing of boots part of a death march. Luckily, the PM (who was a contractor - always a bad sign when you are *undertaking the single largest project the company has taken on, impacting sales, delivery and billing*) didn’t have the authority to fire me. \n\nIt sounds as if you have the right combination of technical skills, PM skills and desire to be successful.",

It’s not about accelerating the *scope* or project delivery in the broader PM sense. It’s vendor follow ups, checking on manufacturing progress, shipping timelines, customs holds, all that good stuff.\n\nIn reality, a lot of expediting is glorified chasing. Calling suppliers, reviewing logistics trackers, resolving weird delays like 'the crate was missing a customs form' or 'paint wasn’t dry before shipping.' It’s essential work, especially in capital heavy industries where a late valve or skidded unit can hold up a big commissioning date, but it’s rarely glamorous.\n\nThat said, if the role is manager level, it might give you visibility into supply chain risk at the portfolio level and let you build influence across engineering, procurement, and construction. Could be a decent stepping stone if you want to climb the PM ladder but still want to stay close to execution. Just don’t expect a lot of technical depth in the day to day it’s much more about persistence, logistics fluency, and communication.",

Each team is managing their part in their own tools (Jira, Figma, HubSpot, Salesforce) but the dependencies between teams all live in random Slack threads.\n\nDesigner says \"waiting on final specs from engineering\" in Slack. Engineering finished specs yesterday but posted in a different channel. Designer doesn't see it, asks again 3 days later. Engineering is like \"we already posted it\" but now they have to re-explain where. Meanwhile marketing is blocked waiting on assets from design.\n\nThe handoffs between teams are where everything falls apart because Slack is terrible for tracking dependencies. Everyone is doing their part but nobody has visibility into the critical path so we don't realize we're off track until the launch date arrives and we're not ready.\n\nTried using project management software but getting 4 different teams to all maintain the same tool is impossible. Engineering wants Jira, design wants Notion, marketing wants Asana. So PM tool becomes my personal tool that nobody else touches.",
