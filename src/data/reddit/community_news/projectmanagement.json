      "text": "For most of my career I watched the same cycle repeat.\n\nSomeone gets hurt or nearly hurt. Leadership responds with more training. More signage. More toolbox talks. Crews nod along. The behavior doesn't change. Six months later, same incident, different person.\n\nThe one that finally broke the cycle for me happened on a remote pipeline job in northern Alberta.\n\nWe had a protocol: specific tools had to come from the equipment yard, roughly 200 yards from the active work zone. The safe procedure was clear. Walk back, get the right tool, walk back out.\n\nNobody did it.\n\nThey used whatever was within reach. Every time. We disciplined people. We retrained people. We posted reminders. The workaround persisted because the workaround was efficient and the procedure was inconvenient.\n\nThe fix wasn't more training. It was pre-staging tool kits at each work zone and eliminating the 200-yard walk entirely.\n\nBehavior changed immediately. Not because people suddenly cared more about safety. Because we stopped designing a system where the safe choice was the hard choice.\n\nWhat I eventually understood after 25 years in the field: the system chooses the behavior more than the individual does. If your procedure requires people to consistently choose inconvenience over efficiency, your procedure will lose. Every time.\n\nThe question that changed how I managed everything after that: are we asking people to do the right thing, or are we designing systems where the right thing is also the easy thing?",

It was redesigning the workflow so the safe action was also the most efficient action.\nMost organizations miss: if compliance requires friction, friction will win.\nBut when you remove waste, you don’t have to enforce behavior – you align it.\nThat principle scales across industries as well, but I focus on construction.",

Long story short about 3 weeks after implementing the change system we had a major outage and rather than taking hours, the on call engineer went to the change management system and found the problem in 20 minutes.  The hook was set because the team found benefits in the system but I also managed to get further intangible benefits because I was able to get analytics from the system, the team turned the system in to a game of challenge of who could log the most change requests, this was a totally unexpected benefit but it also helped mold the team's organisational behaviour.\n\nThis experience has been one of my biggest lessons in my professional career, if your system doesn't show benefit or you can't get buy in, you can't force users regardless of what you do. Work with your stakeholders to ensure that you have their input because it's part of the buy in process. Oh and the guy who gave me absolute grief, he turned out to be the biggest user of the system, I was making some huge assumptions on my behalf and one them thinking he was just being an a-hole but the funny thing he only wanted two minor things changed to make it more efficient for him (not such an unreasonable request at the end of the day).\n\nJust an armchair perspective",

In a lot of the cases, people already know the procedure. The real issue is friction. If the safe or correct option is slower, harder, or inconvenient, the workaround will win almost every time.\n\nThe pipeline example captures that perfectly. The behaviour did not change because people suddenly cared more. It changed because the system stopped forcing them to choose between efficiency and safety. Once the right option became the easy option, the workaround disappeared.\n\nThat lesson applies far beyond that type of work. You see the same pattern in offices, healthcare, nonprofits, everywhere. Staff bypass clunky processes, skip steps that slow client response, and create informal shortcuts just to keep work moving. Leaders often treat this as a compliance or attitude issue, when it is really a design issue.\n\nThe question you ended with is the one more leaders need to sit with….. are we asking people to do the right thing, or designing systems where the right thing is also the easy thing?\n\nWhen systems are built around how work actually happens, behaviour changes without pressure, discipline, or repeated retraining.

Its not because projectmanagement is bad - Sure its complex, difficult and so called \"professionals\" are sometimes big babies but overall its all worth it once the project is done and you have something to show.\n\n  \nNO - the issues are companies that abuse the project manager role and add the role of product owner, Scrum Master, Projectmanager and IT-Expert all together. All of the sudden you are not managing 1 or 2 projects, no you are managing 5 projects, 3 initiatiaves, 6 stupid BAU problems, complaints from Cyber (WTF do i know about header configurations?), 5 reports and 2 audit findings, while fighting legal, data protection, bureaucracy and management.\n\n  \nSometimes it feels like im firefighter, fighting a forest fire with my littel bucket of water and the moment i put 2 flames out, 8 new ones show up. Right now i just want to let everything burn, maybe this bs can rise like a phoenix from the ashes (or will probably just stay dead and rot). \n\nI know things will get better, and i know the cash is good but man sometimes the way companies handle this role is really frustrating.

          "text": "To be honest, project managers are typically under appreciated and under valued in an organisation, typically when things go well, nothing is said but when things go bad, it's your head that is on the chopping block. Generally most PM's are over utilised because they get to be the stop gap to poor organisational policy, process or procedures but I also find PM's also don't actually push back either because they're being told by their management team it will be their responsibility.  \n\nI got taught one of my most valuable lesson when I was first starting out, I was faced with being highly over utilized in a new company I had recently joined and wanted to show I was a good employee. I had 18 active projects (yes, proper projects) of various sizes, complexity and costs and I would spend my whole day running from meeting to meeting and I would literally start my project administration work typically at 5:00-5:30 pm and I was usually working a 12-15 hour day. \n\nA peer of mine was concerned for my welfare and asked how was my workload being prioritised, I genuinely couldn't answer their question. His advice is something that I've never forgotten and one of my biggest lessons I've learned as a Project Practitioner and the question when being overloaded is to ask \"what goes on hold whilst I take on this higher priority task?\" and if you don't get an appropriate response then you start using your project controls of issues and risk logs and escalate to the project board/sponsor/executive to address. \n\nIn relation to my anecdotal story, I pushed back on to the Program Director and Account Manager with the simple question of priority. Long story short the proverbial hit the fan after the client was asked to provide a priority listing, the list was whittled down to 6 active projects and the rest were either placed on (in priority) hold or abandoned outright. This very experience taught me such a valuable lesson as a project practitioner because there is only so much one person can do, and I'm not the whipping boy!\n\nJust an armchair perspective    ",

          "text": "I've implemented Agile in several organisations.\n\nOne of the major tenets of any Agile implementation is that you need the buy-in of senior management. What are your senior management saying?\n\nPut simply, if it's your boss (or boss's boss) who has more sway, then your approach will win. If their boss has more sway, their approach will win. This has nothing to do with what is good for the business or the customers. This has everything to do with empire-building and who gets to look good.\n\nOne of the errors people make when implementing Agile is the belief that somehow, because Agile is iterative, that problems disappear. This is obviously nonsense. People seem to think that \"being responsive\" means that's it's fine to keep changing things all the time, thereby ensuring you have no clear product or \"definition of done\", and a pipeline that is full of senior managers' vanity projects.\n\nDeadlines still exist in Agile: they form a part of an item's priority. When you discuss work items with the Agile team, talk in terms of priority. If you need something done by a certain date, tell them that this deadline is a dependency, and that this should be factored into the priority of the item. You should allow the Agile team to break down your item however they want in order to achieve its delivery, but be clear that your ultimate deadline needs to be met.\n\nThe main difference between waterfall and Agile is that, in waterfall, the Product Spec is generally fixed. This makes sense since, if you are developing a high-rise building, you want to be clear about how much concrete you need to pour, when, and where it goes. Ask your Agile team how they intend to deal with this known problem. Ask it from a place of curiosity, not criticism. How will they ensure an Agile delivery of something physical? \n\nRemember, like every good American idea, the British thought of it first. DSDM predated Agile and was created to allow rapid iteration, something which is not possible in the construction world. Since you can't quickly iterate a data centre build, how will the Agile team adapt to ensure these things happen when they need to while still running an Agile operation?\n\nOne of the founding principles of Agile is transparency. Ask them to make their delivery pipeline visible to you, and all of their backlogs as well. Anything other than a Yes is deflection and is not Agile. Yes, they will want to control what their stakeholders see to some extent (they don't want you banging their door down every day) but they **must** be open to bringing you in to the process. The concept of \"silos\" is inherently anti-Agile.\n\nAnyway, I could wax lyrical on this for ages. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nCheers",

Whenever there's any request for scope change, or anything that affects the schedule, the backlog is up for renegotiation.

In non-agile projects, it's more of a constant discussion about \"-Is this part of the requirements - of course it is! -No, that's not on a signed paper. -But according to our interpretations, it is! -But not according to our interpretation\", leaving the PM alone against the stakeholders. \n\n(sidenote: Many ppl think that agile implies scrum at a two-week cadence, but scrum only says 'less than a month', and imho, few actually follow scrum as it is defined.

What you're getting is a single perspective from an individual that has had experience which may be very different from your own current situation.  I've seen some of my mentoree's try and follow a principle or approach of where they read something and thinking it was right but couldn't actually understand why their approach was failing. \n\nThe other thing to consider as a PM you just don't use a single discipline, experienced and more seasoned PM use numerous disciplines and principles such as finance, HR, contracts, procurement, change management, quality assurance management, operational management, subject matter expertise and the most important two disciplines is Emotional Quotient (EQ) or people soft skills and strategic positioning.  You have to understand these disciplines and master them with the more complex projects and programs that you undertake in the future. People in this thread will offer you suggestions because it was something that they have come across and resonated with them but if you find something which resonates, great then try it but also if it doesn't work then drop it. Don't keep on trying and hoping for a different outcome because that is the definition of insanity and it's amazing to see PM's consistently making the same mistakes. \n\nWhilst I'm not saying not to read but just to highlight the point that there is also no silver bullet to put you on the fast track to be a great practitioner, the only thing that does is practical experience. Also overtime as an experienced practitioner you will learn what doesn't and does work for you as your confidence and experience grows and your style emerges.  In short, take what ever you read and find out what does or doesn't work for you but also take it with a grain of salt because it's an individual's perspective and nothing more and don't fall into the trap thinking it's gospel or the only way to do things. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.

I remember I was very anxious during my first client presentation.\nHere are some tips that could help you \n- do box breathing before the meeting , drink a few sips of water , try to take a walk if you can or listen to your fav song before the meeting\n- prepare well in advance / practice before mirror/ it's okay to pause during présentations to refer notes. It's okay to say - I will come back to you after the meeting if you don't know the answer.\n- make sure to Include all key numbers / points in the slides you are  presenting so that you don't forget - this reduces the fear of getting struck or forgetting \n- they are normal people who also started as juniors - you are here to deliver the key messages and you will improve with experience \n- Also there are free YouTube videos that provide strategies for improving  communication & presentation skills \n\nIf you feel anxious during all of your daily tasks - you should check your blood panels.",

Models themselves are capable of doing 99% of any white-collar job (hopefully I'm not getting hated by some \"domain experts\" who think the know-how in their brain is more valuable than a 1-trillion parameter SOTA model). People also hate on different benchmarks but they are good indicators of general/domain-specific intelligence. \n\nThen comes the elephant in the room, the app layer where you interact with AI. Think of the Co-pilot you've tested. There is so much to be optimized on the app layer, but you generally won't solve them with a stronger model (I guess theoretically you could when they are getting more advanced). The optimization comes mainly from understanding the specific workflows, good UI/UX, and better context management so there is less hallucination. \n\nI guess when folks say AI can't replace them, they are mostly pointing out at the mistakes AI might make as if humans don't make mistakes themselves. \n\n",

I know, I've spent a fair amount of time the last couple of decades leading IT and transformation programs to produce and implement that automation.\n\nToday's AI isn't intelligence. It's highly-optimized pattern-matching and next-in-sequence guessing. Specialized and optimized models just narrow the field for pattern-matching and the domain from which the next-in-sequence can be chosen.\n\nWhich is fine - when you get down to it, that also describes human intelligence. Humans just have a multi-billion year head start on development.\n\nFor a lot of white collar jobs, the vast majority of the work is working with people and working with uncertainty, two things AI is notoriously bad at. When you give AI a reasonably straightforward problem for which a clear answer already exists, it usually comes up with the right answer. Usually, because AI systems are non-deterministic; sometimes they will absolutely come up with the wrong answer, because the model generally has some amount of randomness built in, and that means it sometimes picks the lowest percentage answer instead of the highest. This is an oversimplification, but when you ask AI if 1+1 = 2, most the time the answer is yes. If you ask enough times it will tell you no.\n\nThat's nice, but the problem is that that the \"we already know the answer\" use case is already solved by rules engines that are deterministic. For a rules engine 1+1= 2, always. The challenge with rules engines is that the more you try to automate, the more rules you end up with as you try to account for every edge case. You rapidly approach the point of diminishing returns.\n\nWhat businesses are trying to do with AI right now is replace humans with non-deterministic AI models for the edge cases that are too complex for rules engines...and they're failing. They're failing because most of the time they're trying to solve use cases that require deterministic solutions. They're failing because they previously implemented deterministic solutions that also failed because they didn't address the underlying causes of those failures, which is decades - in some cases half a century or more - of disorganized data, business processes that only exist in the heads of a handful of people and are perpetuated via tribal knowledge, and absolutely massive piles of technical debt.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I use AI every day. There are a lot of places where AI saves me a ton of time in non-routine tasks, and there are definitely use cases where it is able to handle some of the time-consuming drudge work (meeting notes, etc). AI, implemented correctly, is much better than prior tools at searching and surfacing existing knowledge.\n\nIt's just bad right now at the business problems most people are chasing.",

Microsoft adds copilot. 1000 users use copilot but the company reports 10-15k of their workers use AI.

The investment is needed in order to fully integrate AI into an organisation or they can choose to waste money by using external companies hosting their corporate data, which opens so many other can of worms and potentially high impact risks.\n\nJust an armchair perspective",

          "text": "I like how confident my fellow PMs are whenever AI comes up. But I think the reasons most of you give for why you won't be substituted are based on the wrong mindset. The reality on the ground, especially in software companies, is already moving past this debate.\n\nCompanies that are seriously adopting AI tools are effectively eliminating the repetitive work that many PMs consider their core job. Status updates, Jira grooming, scheduling, stakeholder comms, report writing, risk registers. If that's the bulk of your daily value, you should be worried. Not in 5 years. Now.\n\nAnd here's what I think people in this thread are missing.\n\nLook at what's already happened to developers. In software companies that embrace AI, devs are now expected to work across multiple frameworks, handle full stack responsibilities, manage their own pipelines, and use AI coding assistants daily. The skill bar has gone up massively and team sizes are shrinking while output is growing. Developers had to adapt or get left behind. So why exactly do PMs think they're exempt from that same pressure?\n\nThe traditional PM toolkit, the methodologies, the ceremonies, all the frameworks we learned and got certified in, needs serious revision. Most of it was built for a world where coordination was expensive and information moved slowly. AI has collapsed that cost almost entirely. When an AI agent can summarize a standup, flag risks from commit history, generate status reports on its own, and keep stakeholders informed in real time, what exactly is the PM doing that justifies the seat at the table?\n\nAnd please, the answer can't just be \"soft skills.\" That's become a crutch at this point. The real answer has to be genuine strategic value. Making judgment calls when things are ambiguous. Actually understanding the product and the business deeply enough to challenge decisions. Navigating messy client relationships. Knowing a project is heading off a cliff before the metrics catch up. That's real PM value. But getting there means growing way beyond the mechanical coordinator role.\n\nI'm not saying we all disappear overnight. What I am saying is that the profession needs to evolve and it needs to happen fast. The PMs who will do well are the ones using AI right now to kill their own busywork and reinvesting that freed up time into thinking at a higher level. The ones who keep repeating \"AI is just a tool, it can't replace the human element\" without actually expanding what that human element looks like in practice? Those are the ones who'll find out the hard way.\n\nJust my two cents from someone working in software delivery who watches this play out every single day.

AI and automation in general can handle many standardised activities regardless of course. \n\nIf all your current PM role covers is repetitive administrative work then sure, you’d be right to be worried. That’s the easy side of PM though, and what most people think we do all day.

For most PMs, and I include myself in this, it's the majority. Status updates, board maintenance, chasing people for updates, writing reports, scheduling. That stuff fills the calendar. The strategic judgment calls and the empathetic client conversations, those happen what, a few times a month?\n\nSo when that majority of your week gets automated, what happens? Maybe you don't get replaced entirely. Maybe your company just doesn't need four PMs anymore. Maybe they need one who actually does the strategic stuff you're describing and lets AI handle the rest. That's not \"AI can't replace us.\" That's \"AI will replace most of us.\"\n\nAnd about the \"wheel out ChatGPT to explain to a client why you burned a month of budget\" scenario. Sure, a human has to be accountable. But that's one conversation. That's one moment. You don't get to justify an entire role and salary because once a quarter you have a hard conversation. Accountability isn't a full time job. It's a responsibility that sits on top of everything else, and if the everything else is gone, the math stops working in your favor.\n\nAlso the whole \"AI works best in stable environments\" argument was true maybe two years ago. These tools are evolving at a pace that most people in our field are not paying attention to because they're too busy updating boards and attending ceremonies.\n\nI'm not saying soft skills don't matter. I'm saying they're not enough to justify a position if that's ALL you bring. The PMs who will be fine are the ones who combine those human skills with actual strategic thinking, technical understanding, and the ability to deliver outcomes, not just manage process. The ones who just keep saying \"but empathy\" without evolving everything else around it are going to have a rough few years.",

Regardless of whether or not it *can* replace us, c-suite certainly thinks it can, and they make those decisions. \n\n\nNow, there are some caveats here. \n\n\nIn capital projects, I don't see much changing soon. Construction, defense, etc PjMs will be fine for a long time. \n\n\n\nSecondly, even though the *capabilities* are increasing quickly, the speed of uptake is still relatively slow. While software companies are making the switch, banks, CPGs, retail headquarters - these places are slow to adopt. Hell, I work at what is ostensibly a software company and a lot of what I do could be replaced with an Asana subscription and a couple of good Slack connectors, let alone AI. It takes months or even years for us to onboard new software, so change is slow. Companies will take awhile to catch up. \n\n\nThirdly, all of these tools rely on good data. While models are getting better and better at handling complexity, for these tools to work, everyone needs to do *their* job. They need document standardization, knowledge management... They need to update their trackers or tell their trackers to update themselves, etc. If real people really did this regularly, project and program management would have mostly died with MS Project. Yet, here we are. \n\n\nSo while I think we are absolutely going by the wayside, there will be a few year gap, and some of us will stick around. But there will be far fewer of us, and none at all in certain industries, I suspect. ",

It doesn't matter if AI can actually replace you or not. What matters is whether the person holding the budget believes it can. And right now, every CEO and CFO is sitting in meetings hearing about how AI cuts headcount and increases output. They don't care about your standup facilitation skills. They care about the number on the spreadsheet.\n\nAnd your point about data quality is spot on too. These tools need good data and most organizations are a mess. But here's the thing, that's a temporary problem. The tools are getting better at handling messy inputs every single month. The \"our data isn't good enough for AI\" argument is just buying time, it's not a defense.\n\nThe PMs who survive the gap you're describing won't be the ones who got lucky because their company was slow to adopt. They'll be the ones who used that time to become so valuable that cutting them would actually hurt.",

Synthesizing customer feedback, pulling patterns from call transcripts, getting to sharper priorities faster. The inputs are better than they've ever been atleast for the most part.\n\nStill I keep hitting the same wall I have hit in most aspects of my roles. Someone senior has already decided what the quarter looks like and the data doesn't really matter at that point.I'm trying to sort out what data or insights would drive meaningful prioritization decisions.\n\nSo I'm starting to wonder if the whole \"be more data driven\" thing is just something we tell ourselves to feel better about a process that's actually just politics and whoever talked to the CEO last.\n\nWould love to be proved me wrong. Is there a tooling or approach that's actually shifted this dynamic for you or is everyone just quietly dealing with the same thing until they are leadership haha.",

If they choose not to follow your advice or guidance regardless of it be political or them being clueless, then that is on them; In which you can clearly show through your IT systems,  decision, issues and risk logs of business transactions that have occurred (or in a crude way of putting it, you have just covered your behind). \n\nIf you're documenting accordingly, particularly with decision making and the ownership of that, you have been diligent in your role as the PM (again, rightly or wrongly) but it's not your responsibility because your project board/sponsor/executive is ultimately responsible for the success of the project, as the project manager you're responsible for the day to day business transactions and the delivery quality of your project.

This comes back to the understanding of roles and responsibilities of your stakeholder but there is a caveat, if the meeting is to propose any changes to the project's triple constraint of time, cost and scope, then discretion is needed or at the very least have the meeting minuted with the decisions, actions or outcomes clearly documented. \n\nAs the PM you're not expected to know the ins and outs of every task, work package, product or deliverable (hence, roles and responsibilities) however you do need to be aware on how they impact the schedule. E.g. if you have a senior technical lead, it's their responsibility to develop and design and ensure the technical delivery,  you as the PM are responsible for the quality of the delivery and ensuring that it's fit for purpose e.g. using test/use case, applying quality assurances against the deliverable, work package or product etc. \n\nIf you were to attend every project's side meeting there won't be enough hours in the week for you to do your job, let alone attending meetings that you're not needed for. As you become more seasoned as a project practitioner you start to learn which meetings you should or shouldn't be attending. I would also start contacting the meeting chairs and ask if you indeed needed to be there and why. As a personal preference I set very clear expectations if there is no agenda and an open invite I don't attend and especially if the meeting has been set for an hour or more.   \n\nIf someone wants to call a meeting, it's their responsibility to ensure that A) the meeting is warranted B) the relevant stakeholders are invited and ensure there is a quorum that is able to make decisions if needed C) The meeting must have an agenda (NOTE: this is where significant project costs can be incurred when meetings don't have an agenda and it becomes a talk fest with no real outcomes) D) the meeting must be  minuted. You need to make those responsible to take responsibility, as the PM you don't carry everything. \n\nJust an armchair perspective. ",

      "text": "I started a new role as a Project Lead on February 17th. It’s a two pay grade promotion with a solid base salary increase, and I recently earned my PMP, so this felt like a huge career milestone for me.\n\nI’ve been assigned to a large project consolidating five different software systems into one enterprise-wide platform. There are multiple workstreams tied to each system, like HR, finance, reporting, etc. I’m the lead for the finance workstream.\n\nHere’s where it gets tricky.\n\nThe finance workstream technically started about four to six months ago. They were waiting on approval to officially hire and assign project leads to each workstream, which is why I’m just now coming in. Two other new leads will also be starting soon.\n\nThe gentleman who has been running the finance workstream up to this point has never had a project lead. He told me we’ll figure out what “my role” looks like as we go. I understand that some clarity takes time. I’m not expecting everything to be perfectly defined in week one.\n\nBut right now, I’m being treated like an administrative assistant rather than a project lead.\n\nI’m being asked to run Zoom AI Companion during meetings, organize and distribute notes, schedule workshops that are already fully structured with titles, attendees, and homework assignments defined. Basically execution support tasks, not leadership or strategic oversight.\n\nNone of my performance objectives include admin work. They’re focused on delivery, stakeholder alignment, risk management, governance, and outcomes. I worked hard for this promotion and certification. I did not step into this role to manage meeting minutes.\n\nTo add another layer, my direct manager is not part of this project. She already warned me that another project lead on a different workstream is not being utilized appropriately and told me to make sure I escalate if needed. So I know I’m not crazy for sensing this might become a pattern.\n\nOn top of that, the workstream lead has already made it clear he prefers people in the office and isn’t thrilled that I’m home based. That’s not changing. My role is remote eligible and that was part of the agreement.  I’ve worked remote since 2009 and it has never interfered with my performance.\n\nIt’s been a bit of a crushing first week. I’m already feeling anxious about tomorrow, which is not how I expected to feel stepping into a promotion I was excited about.\n\nI’m planning to address role clarity directly in our next meeting and align expectations to my stated objectives, but I want to do it professionally and early before this dynamic sets in permanently.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar, especially stepping into a project midstream where someone has been operating without formal structure? How did you establish authority and role clarity without coming across as territorial or difficult?\n\nWould appreciate any advice.",

When I applied for the PL role, I expected to be declined due to my pay grade, but I have my PMP, which was required, so I took a chance.  It’s not common for employees to be hired for a role two grades above at our company. I was shocked I was picked to interview. I figured it was just to “get the #s” so they could meet candidates criteria and offer to someone else waiting in the pipeline already. So when they contacted to offer the role I was floored - two above my grade = good promotion & increase in pay (not common in our firm at all). \n\nThe person I’m concerned with isn’t being replaced, he is a main stakeholder of six in my matrix team that I will be leading - he is a top leader in finance so he working in the workstream.  He will remain in the workstream in the planning, sprints, and working on the granular technical things I would not customarily be involved in. Yet, I’m being asked to be in all of these meetings to take notes, run zoom, launch AI compaction, send out notes and PowerPoints after meetings… things that an admin would do.  I spoke to another lead (not mentioning what I was being asked to do) and they are deep in strategic transition and planning. I asked if they scheduled all the workshops and what not and she said “nope, that’s nope our scope of work as a lead.” \n\nTrying to be optimistic, but I’m REALLY good at reading people and can figure someone out pretty quickly- and I’m rarely wrong about a person. So I am hesitant knowing my gut is telling me I’m stepping into a role with a strong male personality who seems to be pretty … hate to say- arrogant, and maybe even a bit chauvinistic.  He literally said in a meeting Friday to a young female offshore contractor “looks like you’re ready to go clubbing and be off this call cause you’re all dressed up, unlike your usual” - it was 9p where she was and 9am for us. She didn’t seem enthused by his comment. I felt bad for her. Of course, I don’t know their working relationship, but I could read the zoom room when it was said. \n\nI will def take your advice and try to work backwards to find answers to the points you’ve brought up. I guess he just really rubbed me the wrong way on my first week. Now I’m laying here wide awake worried when I’d usually be asleep two hours by now.",

Has a conversation been had with them about what your role is, or are you *both* making assumptions? Because probably this stakeholder hasn't thought about this at all, or at least I find that it almost always the case. \n\n\nThe other thing that springs to mind is, what strategic transition and planning needs to be happening that someone one week into the role would be doing instrad of what you are doing now? This is where the transition plan comes in. It takes time to onboard and hand off a project, especially as a leader. \n\n\n>  I’m REALLY good at reading people and can figure someone out pretty quickly- \n\n\nThis is a red flag to me.\n\n\nBut regardless, even if it is true, you can't handle this stakeholder from that point of view. Dismissing or making assumptions or setting your behavior about the stakeholder because of a vibe, even if that is 100% true, is a recipe for failure. Unfortunately, we have to work with shitty people all the time. Put that energy toward figuring out how to work with this person, regardless of whether they suck. One key to that is to figure out where they are coming from and why. \n\n\nBut, for the record, admin work is alert of the job. No, I usually wouldn't do it for a functional team's workshops or what have you, but I still own that work for the project or program's operating rhythm. Explaining the difference is often something j have to do, so best to come up with a script for it now. You'll be using it a lot in your career! ",

But it’s worth a conversation with the stakeholder to make sure you’re on the same page of when you’re expected to take over so you are managing your time well in onboarding and not thrown off guard by an unexpected deadline. Maybe map out each item you will handle and when you’re expected to be up to speed on each.",

Had multiple comments back about rudeness\n\n- joins project board meetings to argue with me and the project sponsor, when the sponsor and I are on the same page?? \n\n- gaslights, no accountability, E.g. handing over a project with incomplete discovery, saying \"it's easy\". Requesting more time or resources to complete what is actually a complex discovery? \"No it's easy you only need to do x, it's your job to manage it\"",

The project hasn't even started yet and godddddddd, I'm sucking at this already.\n\nThey want me to maintain multiple hiring trackers (excel books), call people, make interview slots, sync with employee contract firm, reach out to employees to get some information (which can be obtained from one of the internal tool, but no one is ready to give access), reach out to newly joined employees.\n\nIt's like I'm working for one of the Directors and another guy calls me, asking me for his work and what happened to it.\n\nI am also weak at excel (not able to understand pivot tables and stuff).\n\nMy superiors seem disappointed with me and I am not able to understand what to do. I am just stuck and I cannot even leave this project.\n\nNow, the director also wants me to present updates to clients everyday ones the project starts which is in a week or two.\n\nI feel like I need to work a lot on myself to meet all this. How to work on this, what is the kind of mindset that I need to change to, to get on pace. \n\nCan any seniors/superiors here help and guide me for sometime. I really need some help to get used to this.\n\nThey are also starting some training for one of the functional modules.\n\nHow do I go by all this. What tools/work/process should I follow.",

No action, call them out during a meeting.\n2. Excel pivot tables are not that hard, enough walkthroughs online or go to a platform like Udemy for a course. It will cost you an evening of Xbox but you'll become an Excel [wizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHc7bR6y06M).\n3. People will sometimes get dissapointed with you, get married, you will get used to it. Deal with it. Just try to do better. If you get fired you will find another job, do not get too emotionally attached.\n4. Work efficiently, find a default format for emails, for reporting etc. Create an Excel that formats data so you can easily copy/paste the data in the other tools/trackers etc.\n5. Work with a todo list, in the morning write down what you will have to and mark a tasks as done, you will get that feeling of accomplishment, plus you can show your superiors what you did today/this week/this month etc.\n\nYou will get there!",

Say on an excel and the expected timeline.\n\nSay \n- weekly meeting with minute \n- weekly report of status\n- maintain hiring tracker \n…etc.\n\nThen see if you have everything you need to complete those tasks. List the things that stopping you from doing these tasks. “I require access to A system in order to do YYYY”\n\nHave that list ready, and the normal pm like understanding what the project does, who are the stakeholders (may be make a mind map) and try to see if you have an understanding of what’s (supposedly) happening in 2 weeks and 3 months time scale.\n\nGo over the project artifacts see if you have all the requirements, communication list, acceptance criteria… etc.  highlight whatever information is missing and seek help. (From your manager may be)\n\nGood luck!",

Should you want to continue and succeed, first I would ask what are the exact expectations of this role. This isn't exactly project management.\n\nWhat are you presenting exactly? How many people are helping you within the PMO role? Seems like you are doing multiple roles and overloaded with work. You should voice that you feel you have a heavy workload and the demand on what you're doing seems high. Your superiors may not know how much you are taking on given they are higher in the organization.\n\nI feel you should start there and see how that discussion goes. I think that should help inform them and hopefully provide lighten expectations or provide assistance with your workload until you get the hang of it. If that discussion goes nowhere, might be time to look for another job. You need to learn, and you need people who listen. If they aren't willing to help you succeed then it might not be the place for you. Hate to say that but some jobs just aren't worth the stress.",

Do you have a defined scope of work? Are you familiar with what product or services you are delivering to the client? What the major components or milestones are? Is there a signed contract you can review? Start there. You need to know the what. \n\nThen find out if there is a project communication plan and stakeholder register. If these artifacts do no exist see if you can, get your hands on ones from similar projects. \n\nFigure out the project plan. Again is there an existing one or can you copy one? If this is waterfall, once you have the plan, execute against it. Get familiar with a RAID log and keep one. Find out who is making decisions on the project (make a RACI if it will be useful). \n\nIf none of these artifacts exist and your leadership do not support you in creating them and defining scope, etc. then you have an organizational problem. If you are a PM you are not a go-for and you're not admin assistant. You may want to make sure that you're not failing in expectations in part due to the fact that the org does not know what a PM is or is misleading you. \n\n\nIn my experience, as a PM you often work with Directors, VPs and Execs so you have to get comfortable with that. They will make decisions, provide resources and clear blockers. You need them on your team. There can be quite a bit of politics involved.",

It's a one pager that outlines a project overview and objectives (5), deliverable milestones (5) and the top five issues and risks in bullet point or those that need their immediate action, it can just be all bullet point overviews. I would also request a 1:1 meeting to provide any contextual Q & A's in relation to your top 5 paper (give them the option). I have found this approach very effective for both the stakeholder and myself because it allows me to set the tone and outline my expectations (yes I do that with senior stakeholders) and the stakeholder to outline theirs. But that is just me and how I operate.  \n\nJust an armchair perspective. ",

      "text": "Good afternoon to anyone reading this. I’m sharing my experience to hopefully stop someone else from making the same mistake I did during my first Gov Contract Role:\n\nI’ve worked as a Project Coordinator and Junior Project Manager for about five years in Film, Tech, and Healthcare, mostly with NGOs. After seeing former classmates succeed with IT staffing firms, I uploaded my resume to many platforms like Dice.com. For over a year, recruiters reached out but nothing came of it. I eventually landed my current role through a traditional hiring process.\n\nAbout a month into that job, a recruiter contacted me again and I allowed them to represent me. Days later, I received multiple excited calls saying I’d been selected for interviews. I completed two rounds (Teams, then in person) for a Technical Project Manager role and quickly received an offer. With my JIRA Agile certification and location, things moved fast.\n\nThe offer was life-changing: six figures and aligned perfectly with my plan to earn my PMP this year. A very thorough background check followed—schools, employers, references, certifications, DMV—the works. The process lasted nearly three months, during which I continued working my current job while onboarding on breaks. I also negotiated limited PTO and paid holidays, which I was comfortable with given the salary.\n\nHERE’S WHERE EVERYTHING WENT WRONG\n\nBefore a required Non-DOT drug screening, the recruiter asked if I used anything recreationally. I told her I used THC on weekends and lived in Virginia, where it’s decriminalized. She assured me this would not be an issue.\n\nTHIS WAS MY BIGGEST MISTAKE\n\nI had never taken a 7-panel drug test or worked with a government-contracted company. What I didn’t research myself was that the client held federal contracts and followed federal zero-tolerance policies for Schedule I substances, regardless of state law. Trusting the recruiter, I abstained briefly (3 weeks) took the test, and thought nothing of it.\n\nA week later, an MRO informed me my sample contained trace THC. I explained the Non-DOT status and state legality, but they clarified the company followed federal policy. I panicked. The recruiter’s entire team became involved, admitted they hadn’t fully understood the client’s policy, and immediately scheduled a second test. I fully abstained and passed.\n\nDespite advocacy from the recruiter and my would-be manager, the company enforced a strict rule: any positive result during onboarding meant automatic offer rescission—even with a subsequent negative test. The offer was pulled.\n\nI wrote an emotional appeal to HR, but they were firm. DOT and VDOT later confirmed I wasn’t federally regulated as a Non-DOT employee, but that only meant company policy applied—and this company had zero tolerance and no rehabilitation exceptions.\n\nThe job was gone.\n\nWHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE: Never rely solely on a recruiter’s assurances. They aren’t bad people, but they are salespeople. If something isn’t explicitly confirmed in writing, verify it yourself. I trusted vague answers instead of doing my own research—and paid the price.\n\nI fell hard but eventually recovered. I had to humble myself to get my old job back, but I’m sharing this to help others protect themselves. We work too hard for our education and certifications to lose opportunities over assumptions. Verify everything—use Google, ChatGPT, anything—before making life-changing decisions.\n\nI’m embarrassed and disappointed, but I’m only 27, and it’s not over. One thing is certain: I will never fail another 7-panel drug test again.\n\nThank you for your time,",

I'll admit I'm partially to blame also due to not standing up to some individuals and allowing scope creep. \n\nSo project started 1 year ago, basically an IT upgrade, hardware procurement, app upgrade and data migration. In that  time 2 board approved changes in scope. All straight forward so far. \n\nScope changes\n 1) addition of preproduction environment. Simple enough just extended schedule and cost\n2) changes in hardware requirements. This is where it gets problematic. One of the board (my line manager and reaponsible for my contract renewal) has used this CR to ram in a pet technology he wants for a new tech without having to go through approvals for it. I missed it (didnt realise the inpact and was told it would take 3 weeks to implement) and the change was approved by the board. \n\nProblem is now we are 6 months late because of this addition of the different tech. Budget is blown because of the unforseen costs of the scope creep and (I'll admit) my failure to account for the costs of the 2 CRs and revise the budget earlier. \n\nNow I need to present to the board and outline the issues, projected costs and path to success (and not get fired)\n\nI'm baffled how to phrase it, maybe I'm too close to the problems. But issues are\n1) poc caused significant delays and cost over run\n2) costs of changes not factored in earlier and budget revised. Now I need to revise the budget and hardware costs have gone up by nearly 200%\n3) uncertainty on when hardware is going to be available. Basically the poc guy manages hardware and he's dragging his behind on deciding soec and saying it ain't my concern. But this project depends on the availability of the hardware and is supposed to fund the price.\n4) person that rammed stuff in is difficult and confrontational. Can't openly pin blame on them as it will become antagonistic \n\nLooking for a way to summarise this and provide a decent path to green and no matter what I write it just doesn't seem to highlight how the scope creep and governance failures  have impacted everything.

          "text": "Firstly, breathe as people don't die in ditches over things like this, but to be honest it's going to get a bit bumpy for a while but seriously keep in mind that it's only a temporary situation. Secondly, the reality is that you have lost control of your project because you've had changes to your approved baselined project but the reality is that you've not administered them due diligently, which should become a very important learning lesson for you.\n\nA suggested approach is to go back to your original business case and start mapping out your project's chronology of events and the changes and the decisions made as the evidence of change and what the impact that it had over your original baselined project. I would also suggest that you propose or recommend to your project board/sponsor/executive to placing the project on a momentary or temporary hold in order for you to rebaseline your project. From a project administration perspective is that you need to go back through and revise or update your project controls (issues & risk logs, milestones, deliverables, project schedule and your project plan and to reflect the new delivery date but the most important thing is to have the new baseline approved (first and foremost).  The key is once you rebaseline your project your only focus is your triple constraint and you need to actively manage your exceptions. The golden rule is if any one of the constraints of time, cost or change then the other two must change. All you do is ask if which one do they want to change because it's a causal effect relationship between the constraints and all your doing is putting the responsibility back on to the requestor and asking them to choose. Trust me, it sorts out pretty quickly if the change is really warranted or not.\n\nAlso keep in mind the person who rammed their agenda through can't dispute the facts when you can show evidence of where and how they got their change through but it also means that you have to be honest with your project board/sponsor/executive and admit that you could have handled this a little better (this is your lessons learned as a project practitioner, your triple constraint of time, cost and scope is your only priority and you have to document any exception to that agreed and approved baseline).\n\nGet your ducks lined up in a row and at your next status meeting raise the matter, the reality is the longer you leave it the worse it becomes. Go ready with your mapped chronology of events, understand your risks and issues, more importantly go with a proposed idea (e.g. a course of action) and ask for your project board/sponsor/executive for guidance on the matter.\n\nThe reality is that your project board/sponsor/executive is actually responsible for the success of the project, your responsibilities is to ensure the day to day business transactions are delivered. Keep in mind the project board/sponsor/executive can't nor shouldn't hang you out to dry on this because they're at fault just as much as you are. Good luck and this will work itself out in the end, just remember you need to be a little more diligent when handling change.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

I have been trying to learn the ins and outs of managing a project and how to do it effectively. From running this project as my first major NPD project, I am a newfound respect for project management and how it is a very difficult thing to do.\n\n  \nAny who I am running into this problem of my weekly stand-up meeting getting \"hijacked\" by people. Today my bosses boss decided to sit in on our meeting. He heard something that he didn't agree with and went off on a 30-minute tangent that was not adding any value to our meeting or discussion. He forced me to go through various ERP screens to find an answer he was looking for, then proceeded to tell me I should know this process better (even though he didn't know it as well as he thought). Then at the final minutes of the meeting he decided to go on another tangent and the meeting ended up lasting an additional hour. Not sure the best way to tell a director that he is getting us off task?\n\n  \nAnother example is another engineer who is working on the project. He has been a great recourse but is very fixated on certain things. He works in R&D (actually is the lab manager) and does not really care about the timeline at all. He also doesn't care much for following standard processes. So, he constant brings up things that are not big issues and could easily be addressed post launch and are not showstoppers. He often interrupts me and won't let things go. My boss is aware of this and doesn't do much to back me up or put an end of things. So again, a person who is technically above me at a manager level that I can't really tell to buzz off...\n\n  \nI would love any advice a seasoned project manager could give me!",

          "text": "lol. Welcome to the fun!\n\nI’ll get to your boss’ boss in a minute.  Let me start with general advice, then your colleague, and then get to him.\n\nSo, generally, it’s a best practice to send the meeting agenda in advance.  You can include it in the meeting invite. It helps people prepare, and gives you something to point to if people get off track.  Then, at the start of the meeting, you can review the agenda and ask if anyone has any concerns/questions about the planned agenda.\n\nFrom there, it really gets into soft skills as well as technical knowledge. If someone takes the conversation in a different direction, I will usually let them go for a minute or two, then (sometimes rudely) jump in and ask if the conversation is relevant to the meeting agenda, or if it can be added to the meeting’s “parking lot”, and discussed at the end of the meeting once non-relevant invitees have left. Or, does there need to be a specific meeting about that topic?\n\nSometimes (rarely), someone is bringing up an issue that affects the project and needs to be discussed right then, in which case I’ll: 1. ask if we have right people to discuss it, and try to bring in anyone needed, and 2. promise to reschedule the original meeting once we clear the issue.\n\nFinally, dealing with leaders: you can try to get them to agree to a parking lot, but sometimes they are on a power trip and won’t agree.  In which case, sometimes you have to put up with it, but should discuss it with your boss to see if they have any tips.  Then, of course, reschedule your original call and leave them out ( if you can). \n\nDepending on the personalities involved, you may even schedule a one on one with him to discuss the information he needs to see  how you can get to him without him hijacking your meeting.  \n\nUltimately, however, the most important thing is that the information is getting to the right people at the right time to keep the project moving forward.  You may be able to make up the difference with an email chain or a slack /teams chat instead. \n\nSo, TL:DR:\n\n1. Publish the agenda before\n\n2. Stress the agenda at the start of the meeting, and get agreement from the team\n\n3. Encourage tangents to move to the parking lot, but make sure they do get discussed\n\n4. Escalate problems with your boss, and determine how your boss’ boss can best get the info he needs without hijacking your meetings. ",

Once projects are really rolling my progress meetings usually take less than 15 mins.  Consultants love me for giving them back time.\n\nAlso when you send out the agenda ahead of time ask if there are any items you missed.   If someone brings something up that isn’t on the agenda table it and give them a call later.\n\nPut action items at the top of your meeting minutes with assignments.
