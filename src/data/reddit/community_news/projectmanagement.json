Some even deleted without reading it. \n\nDoes anyone else just presume no one is going to read their emails but still send them anyway? What's your preferred way to get general information to people, weekly cadence with all participants? smaller communications with active participants and only general updates to larger group less frequently?

Everyone will stop looking at your and stop paying attention. All eyes will immediately drop, the person will become disengaged, and they will block you out and will read what you just put in front of them. If Bezos did that the garbage about making them read for 30 minutes is nothing more than trying to clean up a mess he created.\n\n30 minutes of reading time is ten pages, not a \"brief/memo/report.\"\n\nI don't let these situations happen. I send out the agenda beforehand and team members review and bring that agenda to the meeting (they can add agenda items if they want beforehand). We immediately talk about the agenda items, no Kabuki theater or special dances. Reviewing and bringing the agenda to the meeting is a standard, not a suggestion. The first meeting I ever ran I did hand out agendas first and watched every face immediately ignore me and drop to read the sheet I just put in front of them. I figured it out in about two seconds. Now it's no longer a problem.",

That forces a habit that creates your frustration when you do have something important to convey. A few things I would suggest that may help:  \n1) Think about why you want to communicate in the first place. What is the use/outcome for your audience?  \n2) What channel is most acceptable to the audience you need to reach?  \n3) What is the urgency of the communication?\n\nOften through these questions you can do a few thing:  \n1) Tailor the communication so it is more valuable.   \n2) Reach a smaller audience so the communication is targeted to who needs to receive it.   \n3) Use a channel that will be consulted.   \n4) Use a channel that matches the urgency of the communication. \n\nHappy to chat further if that isn't helpful.",

At the time, I thought I was just procrastinating or entertaining myself, but looking back now after 25 years in the corporate world, I realize those games were actually my very first lessons in strict Risk Management.\n\nIn those games, every single assumption you make, whether to turn left into a dark hallway, when to save your limited ammo, or trusting a new character, can backfire immediately. In Project Management terms, those are unmitigated risks waiting to blow up your critical path. I realized that the monsters I face now just look different. Instead of zombies, they are missed deadlines, scope creep, and hidden dependencies, but the mindset required to survive is exactly the same.\n\nYou have to anticipate the risks before they appear around the corner, you have to manage your limited resources because you never know when a boss fight (a steering committee meeting) is coming up, and you always need a contingency plan for when things go sideways. \n\nIt turns out those wasted hours in front of a screen weren't wasted at all; they were training for the chaos I manage today.\n\nI am curious if anyone else has a similar experience where a \"useless\" hobby turned out to be the best training for your career. \n\nDid anyone else learn stakeholder management from Dungeons & Dragons or resource allocation from playing Age of Empires?",

You can't rely on a paycheck to keep people in line; you have to rely entirely on culture, shared purpose, and social influence. If you can get 20+ people to show up on time and execute a complex strategy purely for the love of the game, you have mastered influence without authority, which is arguably the hardest PM skill to teach.",

More traditional workflow where they work on features locally in cursor or claude code. We have some base instructions and workflows that ensure the AI follows set TDD processes and has really good context. Then when they merge, it runs through all of our automated tests and if it passes, we have a release manager interface where they can promote it through to staging then production just by clicking buttons. And if they need to rollback they just click a button as well. So the full pipeline can be managed by non-technical engineers. \n\n2. For more rapid feature dev and experiments we can use replit, v0, figma make and easily build apps on top of our existing APIs and deploy them via the same release manager, and they can all exist inside our main app domain alongside our core apps. All without needing to involve the core “engineering” team. \n\nWe basically restructured our infrastructure and tooling to allow anyone in the business to work on and release features and apps, and created a base layer of context and resources that allow them to get up and running really fast.",

The past few months was spent on overall onboarding, taking over 2 smaller projects that we've successfully launched and the first stages of exploring a new project that I've been assigned to.\n\nThe project is scheduled to be delivered by Nov/Dec 2026. We've worked on a high level business case that's been approved by management. Now's the time to actually kick it off.\n\nI've had discussions with my manager and our Digital Product Manager (who manages all the Product Owners and essentially coordinates the IT resources for all projects) and I'm kind of stuck: it seems they are expecting me to do PM, BA and FA work while also taking up the role of the business owner. There's no one assigned on the team but me and one Product Owner. I'm being pushed to organize requirements sessions with architects but without the right people on the team (it's a complex large scale project in a large organization) I flagged that these sessions aren't productive and quite simply a risk to the project.\n\nSo I'm kind of stuck and don't know where to go. I checked in with my sponsor last Friday and also raised the issue that we need to onboard the right people in the team to get the project started. She said she was going to look into it.\n\nI'll draft a RACI matrix to try to explain what I believe I need, but I'm very surprised at how larger projects are being managed here. It's stressing me out and it's not very motivating.\n\nIs there anything else I could do according to your experience?",

But all is not lost. You need to go and pick up either the PMBOK 6 or the new 8 and run through the stages of a project from initiation to closeout. \n\nIdentify not just the documents required, but the roles, and expected outcome of each.

So all the ambiguity is landing on you by default.\n\nA few practical things I’d do:\n\n* Stop framing this as resourcing and start framing it as **decision risk**. Early requirements and architecture done without the right people don’t save time — they just lock in rework later.\n* A RACI is useful, but only if it’s tied to consequences. Be explicit about which decisions are being made without owners and what that means downstream.\n* Be very clear which hats you’re being asked to wear. PM + BA + business owner only works if authority comes with it. Accountability without authority is a problem, not a challenge.\n* Don’t run *“requirements theatre.”*  Workshops without the right people create false confidence. If you’re forced to proceed, label outputs as exploratory, not baseline.\n\nThis isn’t you lacking capability. It’s weak front-end governance.

Neither one happened because we needed to ship features to stay competitive, so we just kept shipping for four months while this known prod issue sat there unfixed. Then it broke again and leadership acted all shocked about why we keep having the same problems.\n\nMaybe it's because the follow-ups from these reviews go straight into the backlog behind feature work and nobody actually looks at them again until the same thing breaks. This is the third time this year we've had a repeat incident where the fix was documented but never got implemented.\n\nHonestly starting to wonder why we even bother writing these things if nothing ever changes.

My name is the one taking responsibility (edit: taking responsibility, not being given credit.  Everyone doing the actual work is given credit.  I just choose to be responsible for any success/failure judgement - they’re volunteers. IMO they never fail, they just did their best) and I’m fully engaged. \n\nA key thing to keep in mind is these a problems sre *reported and escalated by the people who* ***volunteered*** *to resolve them*.\n\nThey *want* to fix this stuff and are usually stoked that someone is giving them the authority to do so since a lot of procedural fixes gets kicked up the ladder and then never heard from again.  All I need to do is clear the runway for them, and make sure the extra work isn’t painful and it’s something the folks *wanted* to do.\n\nAn important note here: in my experience most people don’t want to *only* do their day to day work.  They want to help build the company, improve processes, fix flaws or whatever - they often feel they have expertise that is underutilized and they are correct.  This gives them a runway for a greater contribution and the team members dig it as long as they feel it’s recognized and they’re not being exploited which on.\n\nEdit: reread your comment after I finished.  The “accountability” falls more on management to adhere to their commitments to support these initiatives that their *teams* which describe them as important and want to fix them and that’s the tack I take.  The team members themselves identified the issues, their importance and *volunteered* to do the work in addition to their day to day jobs.

The big win for us was that the tracked time auto-populates into the client's portal under the right project, so it's transparent for them and easy for us to Bill from. It cut out so much manual admin. It's not the cheapest, but for us it replaced like three different tools we were trying to stitch together.\n\nMight be worth a look if you're also managing the client side of things, not just internal hours.

      "text": "Hi everyone,   \n  \nI’m looking for advice on how to frame a past role in interviews, especially when interviewing with competitors in a small industry where informal reference checks are likely.\n\n  \n**Background**\n\nI joined as PM in mid-sized company whose core platform underpinned most client work, lets call this product X\n\nWhen joining I was assigned a bespoke, high-revenue project (Project A) for the biggest client of the company , that barely used Product X. I had a dedicated team and focused almost entirely on it. The project launched successfully and the client asked for further phases.\n\nAfter launch, I took on a second project (Project B) that ***was*** heavily dependent on Product X. At that point:\n\n* I had limited hands-on exposure to Product X\n* Only one senior engineer had deep platform knowledge\n* That engineer was frequently pulled onto other priorities\n\nI relied too much on the senior engineer’s confidence that work was “easy” and didn’t verify progress or escalate risk early enough. In the final weeks before launch, senior leadership had to step in, reallocate resources, and push hard to get it live. The Project B client was happy, but internally it was painful.\n\nAfter this:\n\n* The senior engineer was let go\n* I was put on a PIP\n* Despite completing the PIP, I was eventually let go\n\n  \nI **fully own** that I should have escalated risk earlier and relied on delivery evidence rather than reassurance. I’m trying to articulate that learning clearly and professionally, especially when interviewing within the same sector.\n\n**What I’m asking:**  \n  \nHow should I frame this experience honestly in interviews without oversharing?\n\n\n\n",

Some teams kept working the old way and then blamed the ERP when their numbers didn't match. And the problem of \"unclear ownership\" where no one really \"owned\" master data or cross-department workflows is another unclear one. \n\nThis is actually why we now have to invest even more and talking to an external ERP advisory firm ([Leverage Technologies](https://www.leveragetech.com.au/solutions/erp/) through a referral) - not to re-implement, but to help untangle ownership, data standards, and cross-team workflows we clearly didn't plan for properly.\n\nEither way, I've seen this happen before in other companies - ERP projects will just fail due to poor planning, lack of training and not customizing enough.

Your business processes, rules and workflows were not captured as part of those requirements.\n\nI had the luxury of working with a very gifted Senior Business Analyst on a large enterprise software change, when I hired the SBA I was just expecting some wireframes based upon user requirements. What I got was a fully constructed IT system requirements, data storage and flow requirements and business workflows all integrated into the technical design that were actually mapped back to use requirements. I got to ride on the coat tail of this exceptional work as the executive complimented the program because neither KPMG or Deloitte where able to achieve in what my SBA achieved. I essentially got schooled on how software development should be done and it's been one of my most important lessons as a project practitioner.\n\nMy SBA taught me an extremely valuable lesson about how to approach software development and how to capture technical and user requirements. The next major program I worked on I started to roll out the framework that my SBA had developed, and my program board literally said \"Are you shitting us?\", and all I said 'If you want it done properly, I have an example of how things should be done properly or do you want the program to fail?\". It was like watching the tumble weeds blow on through.\n\nI find most software projects fail because they don't drill down fair enough because a PM is not aware of how far to drill down or companies start thinking it's going to cost too much but fail to acknowledge on how much it actually costs when their implementation fails. It's why I bemuse when PM's in this reddit forum ask \"What software do you use?\" It's your business and user requirements will dictate what software to use and you find that out when you map your requirements to an application, not just spray and prey.\n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

The other success output of the program was to show how inefficient the team was operating as the program also optimised workflows which unexpected benefit realised but also allowed for cross training of staff because each staff member had built their own role and function within the team leaving the single points of failure, especially if someone was sick or on extended leave.\n\nOrganisations sometimes perceives planning a \"waste of time or an excessive cost\" and think just get building and we work from there. Taking the time to plan could turn out more cost effective than paying for all the things that go wrong with a bad deployment.",

Being able to take action under uncertainty is an important skill, but if you're not okay with significant cost increases as you learn new things, ERP implementations are one area where spending a little more time up front can decrease the amount of surprises you'll find during execution.  You can't eliminate ALL surprises in advance, but that doesn't mean you just accept the vendor's word.  Risk identification and establishing management reserves are steps on ERP projects that should be performed early.  Finding the right balance between planning and execution, or at least giving it an honest attempt, is really the way to minimize surprises and failure.\n\nI won't bore you with my \"learning\" experiences.",

Leverage and trust internal teams rather than defaulting to vendor control.\n3. **Enforce Financial Accountability** Missed vendor deliverables should result in financial consequences, as defined in the contract.\n4. **Prioritize High-Quality Documentation** Documentation must be complete, accurate, current, and well-versioned. While this requires significant effort, it is critical for long-term supportability and issue resolution years after go-live.\n5. **Minimize Vendor Turnover** Require continuity in vendor staffing or impose penalties for roll-offs tied to incomplete work.\n6. **Keep Leadership Internal** Program and workstream leadership roles should be filled by full-time employees with relevant experience to ensure continuity beyond go-live.\n7. **Maintain Continuous Testing Rigor** Testing outside formal test cycles should be nearly as rigorous as during planned cycles. The primary difference should be who executes the work (technical teams versus end users), not the quality standard.\n8. **Over-Communicate Consistently** Communicate broadly, frequently, and redundantly. Maintain accurate distribution lists and assume over-communication is preferable to missed communication.\n9. **Staff for Reality, Not Optimism** Accept that ERP transitions require temporary overstaffing—particularly in technical and business process roles. Organizations must sustain daily operations while executing significant transformation work. External support can help, but it cannot fully replace internal capacity.\n10. **Resolve Data Issues First** Address future-state data requirements at the outset. While tedious, this approach prevents extensive downstream rework in both data and code.\n\n \n\n**E**RP implementations are inherently stressful and complex. They do not merely replace technology platforms; they fundamentally reshape business processes across the organization. The upside is that these transformations typically occur once every decade or longer. Executed correctly, the investment in leadership, discipline, and fundamentals pays dividends long after the system goes live.(formatted with AI for readability)",

But allows a better dynamic understanding of processes.\n\nFor example, to find if a Workbook is opened I use a boolean function that is called GOTOWORKBOOK(name) where name is a fragment of the name of the workbook. So the whole line in the main program may look like IF GOTOWOKBOOK(\"Book1\") THEN so if the workbook is found, return TRUE and move to that workbook. Else, skip the instructions inside the IF block.\n\nTo write GOTOWORKBOOK function you can use ChatGPT.\n\nOnce you have all the needed generic functions, you can start programming. My experience is that if you encapsulate Excel object management code, you can reduce your main program to up to 20% of the size you would have if you write code from scratch.\n\nThe reason why it works is that by coding small VBA prototypes I learn about how data is managed by users. And if there is a need to change a process, you will find out quickly.  The trick is to be in the shoes of users while you code, as if you had to perform the task.\n\nIt is slower than making general documentation of processes but if you documented macros properly, you will be able to have the whole prototype as a collection of local prototypes with the form of local Excel VBA macros.\n\nThe problem with not prototyping is that you will see the flaws when you already coded the software and released it to the public.\n\nThe advantahe of Excel VBA code is that it allows to create local prototypes for specific users that will increase their productivity on live processes. If the macro fails, they can always go back to manual processing.\n\nVBA macros require Windows settings to be set as \"MM/DD/YYYY\" for short date and dot as decimal symbol. Anything different and macros will suffer weird errors. So when the macro runs, it verifies that and sends me an email if the machine does not have the proper configuration. And then I proactively call the user.  That surprises users because they expected the first chance to claim that the macro did not work so they could not change their ways of doing things.\n\nAlso when there is an error, I make the error handling at the main code, and it sends me an email with information to replicate the error. That way I am ahead of people complaints.",

The secret to surviving this career without burning out is realizing that the goal isn't to complete the list, but to ruthlessly prioritize it.\n\nIf you treat every item as equally important, you will drown. My approach has always been to stop worrying about the length of the backlog and start obsessing over the priority of the immediate tasks. I lean heavily on the Scrum mindset for this exact reason. My job isn't to do everything; it is to ensure the team is working on the absolute highest priority for today and that nothing is blocking them from finishing it.\n\nAlso, be careful that your list isn't growing because you are absorbing noise that should be filtered out. A never ending list is often a sign of scope creep. You have to be willing to protect the project boundaries and escalate issues rather than just adding them to your pile. Peace of mind doesn't come from finishing the work, because there is always more work, it comes from knowing that the work you are doing today is the most critical thing for the project's success.",

Ultimately everyone is a minority of one and different tools work for different people regardless of what categorizations may apply. No excuses. \n\nThere are lots of tools and methodologies to manage to-do. There are a few commonalities among the good ones. \n\n* You have to prioritize. Not everything is of equal importance. \n* Schedule and priority are not the same. \n* Whatever you choose and use, the system should be easy and fast to maintain. \n* Delegate.\n\nI use more than one tool. Outlook is the centerpiece since you can populate Tasks from email and calendar. It integrates with Teams and Slack. You can even set and update from Whatsapp with third party software. You'll be hard pressed to find any meaningful software that can't talk to Outlook. If you have some tool that doesn't talk to Outlook it likely doesn't talk to other equally important tools e.g. accounting and HRIS. \n\nI use Apple Reminders on my phone sometimes, mostly for short term to-dos that come from text messages. \n\nI always have a pad of 3x5 Post-It notes in my pocket. If all else fails I take notes there. This is especially helpful if I have to sketch something or block out an architecture or a workflow. \n\nNot really a tool but a great story - right people in the right place at the right time generated a bunch of drawings on cocktail napkins. Those are part of a patent in USPTO. Lesson: perfect is the enemy of good enough. \n\nLearn how to use file references to local and shared storage e.g. file:///H:/ProjA/PM/DetDesign/Risk.xlsx so you can click on the reference and the document opens. This is time efficient, reduces errors, ties into version control, and ties into document management. \n\nIf you're mentally blocked on something move on to something else and get back to it.",

      "text": "Hi, I'm 25 yo and I find myself in the role of managing several small/medium projects in a small software consulting firm in Barcelona, but I don't have a lot of experience (I've always been a developer).\n\nAt my job we don't have a standard set of tools for managing projects: resource assignments, tasks, dates... (just some place to write the worked hours so we can bill it to the clients). Normally other consultants that manage developers work just use a Doc or and Excel to write things down, and have mostly everything in their heads.\n\nI've just started using Jira, multiple kanban dashboards and backlogs to keep everything written down, and I assign tickets with as much context as I can to developers, sometimes to devs outside of my small team (4 devs + me for 5 or 6 different projects)\n\nBut, between the meetings with clients, devs calling for help, sometimes developing myself and designing software architecture, I find myself I don't have that much time to maintain the jira, to read every update on every ticket... Much less to really plan and keep track of the projects, segment the work in smaller bits to delegate to other devs outside of my small team.\n\nI want to ask for more resources, but I barelly have time to manage the ones I have (on top of managing the projects).\n\nSimeone more experienced, have some advice? Would be apreciated, thanks",

One way or another service requests should result in explicit notices to providers and responses should result in explicit notices to those requesting service. Logging into yet another piece of software doesn't do that. \n\nFurther, focus really should be on the need of the service consumer, not on the service provider. \n\nWhile there are alternatives, in my opinion email is the best vector for communication. There is existing infrastructure including archiving and search. There is existing support. There are a ton of tools for aggregation and reporting. \n\nMost companies have an employee web portal. This is the place to access [contact forms](https://www.optimonk.com/website-contact-form-examples/) (no experience with that vendor - result from Google search on 'web contact form'). The big benefit of contact forms is that you can mandate fields, use drop downs to facilitate workflow routing, and integration with email is simple. \n\nOther notification mechanisms are possible, but text often means changing platforms and IM doesn't integrate with other tools as well. \n\nThis starts to look like in-house ESM which isn't my intent. Email is easy to integrate with existing systems on the service side. In your case, facilities can continue using Excel for backlog, scheduling, and resource management while HR uses their HRIS. IT can continue to use Jira or whatever ticketing system You reduce the amount of change people must endure, *especially* the people needing service. Remember that the service providers (facilities, IT, HR, Legal) are overhead functions and those making requests are revenue generators. Talk to the vendors of the systems in use in your company for use cases and sample integrations. You don't have a unique problem. Learn from those who have gone before you. \n\nNote that if an overhead function changes their tool of choice, nothing looks different to the service consumer. \n\nWhatever course you take evaluate based on 1. ease for the person making a request 2. minimum change 3. ROI 4. ongoing cost.",

If your staff can just 'chat' to submit a request to HR or IT without learning a new interface, adoption becomes immediate, and you actually get the visibility you're looking for.\n\n​We actually published a deep dive on how to calculate the ROI of GenAI-based Service Management versus traditional portals.

That’s usually how you end up overloaded again.\n\nWhat’s worked best for me is dividing based on **complexity and decision load**, not volume. A few practical ways to think about it:\n\n* **Type of work, not count** Some projects are execution-heavy but predictable. Others are small on paper but full of ambiguity, stakeholders, and decisions. Balance those across PMs.\n* **Lifecycle split (if it fits)** One PM focuses more on front-end work (initiation, scoping, planning, approvals), the other on delivery and close-out. This only works if handovers are clean and decision and accountability are clear.\n* **Stakeholder intensity** Projects with high exec visibility, political risk, or lots of external parties take more PM energy. Don’t stack all of those on one person.\n* **Skill and context fit** If one PM has stronger technical depth and the other is better with change, comms, or vendors, lean into that. Forcing symmetry usually creates friction.\n* **Capacity review, not a one-off split** Make it explicit that allocation gets reviewed monthly or quarterly. Projects change shape, and static splits cause drift.\n\nThe biggest mistake I see is treating PM capacity like a spreadsheet problem. It’s really about **where decisions and uncertainty sit**. Balance *that*, and the workload tends to even out naturally.\n\nHope that helps.",
