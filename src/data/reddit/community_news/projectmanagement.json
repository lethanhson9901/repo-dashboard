Enrolled in a Project Management class for my grad school program.\n\nThis shit is so abstract that monks would have trouble wrapping their heads around it.\n\nSo jargon filled that it makes L R Hubbard's engram see dollar signs.\n\nAnd the class is so fucking bad that I am losing my goddamned mind.\n\nAlot of fill-in-the-blank tests with the blanks being \"oo, sorry, 'common ground' would be incorrect. what we wanted to hear was MIDDLE GROUND.\" OR SENTENCES WHERE I CAN ONLY GET THEM RIGHT IF I EITHER MEMORIZED THE BOOK OR LITERALLY HAVE THE MATERIAL OPEN IN FRONT OF ME, and then, whats the fucking point?!\n\nThis professor had 20 quizzes due by the third day of an asynchronous class. It took me all night. And by the end I was ripping my mouse apart and performing self harm on my skull. I feel like I have a concussion today.\n\nAND SHE HAS IN THE SYLLABUS A RECOMMENDATION TO JOIN THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE!\n\nIf that institute is all this? Burn it to the fucking ground.\n\n\"Kanban\" \"Project Requisitiion coordinator\" \"Scrum\" as if they fucking have ever played rugby, or even met a rugby player. \"SAFe\"\n\nThe definitions are so self-congratulatory and confident in it's own neccesity. \"Adaptable, also known as Agile methodologies, allow for quick changes and...\" \"But Predictive models also do well in..\" \"But HYBRID models combine the best of both of them\" woooooo WHO WOULD HAVE FUCKING THOUGHT THAT NOT BEING STUCK IN ONE WAY OF THINKING WAS THE FUCKING POINT.\n\nDecision trees\n\nKanban Board Owners\n\nSTAKEHOLDERS. FUCKING STAKEHOLDERS. I CANT EVEN.\n\nI AM DONE. GODDAMN IT I AM DONE. I AM SO FUCKING DONE. I AM DONE. I WANT TO FUCKING CRY\n\nThere is not a genuine human emotion in this class, I feel like I was traumatized by the 80s man from Futurama. I'm vacillating between rage and wanting to cry.\n\nI'm sorry guys. I tried. But fuck project management.\n\nEDIT: Part of my rage could also be that she requires us to get a Chat GPT account, and my resolution for the year was to not use AI ",

I don't know what your degree is in, but if you're anywhere adjacent to corporate America you'll run into a lot of it anyways because you're almost certain to \\*work\\* with PMs.\n\nAll the people telling you you'll never use most of it as a PM are wrong. Am I trotting out PERT charts on a regular basis? Nope. Have I needed to because some exec thought it was \\*ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO BE SUCCESSFUL\\*...yes. If I didn't know what a PERT chart was it would have been hard to recover that relationship.\n\n Did I get an absolutely insane and guaranteed to fail project canceled once because I was able to sit down with the CFO and walk them through a Monte Carlo simulation of possible outcomes, where \"bankrupting the company due to fines and legal fees\" was more likely than \"meeting all objectives\"? Also yes.\n\nExactly once in my two decade+ career for both of those tools.\n\nYou're being shown a toolbox full of tools. Some are going to sit on the bottom of that toolbox 99% of the time. Knowing what and when to pull out the right tool is key. KNowing what all the tools and what they do is where that starts.\n\nAll the tools and jargon in the world are useless if you don't know how to use them and don't have the soft skills that are the core competencies for PMs...but if somebody says \"can you put a slide together showing the critical path as a GANTT chart, with annotations showing the key cross workstream dependencies and significant risks so we can share it with the executive stakeholders,\" you had better be able to parse it.",

I have an undergraduate in electrical engineering and I work as a test engineer in manufacturing. \n\nMy EE GPA was 2.14. I had a rough time in college and I will probably never go back for a masters. \n\nMy Grade for the 3 semesters of PM courses?  100% each semester. \n\nPM makes a lot of sense once you’ve worked on projects and have seen the tools in use. Once you’ve seen the pain points and what the tools are used for, they make sense and when you learn about them in class it is just putting a name to something that feels very obvious. \n\nWhat I saw in that class was that not all PM are engineers, but all engineers understand PM. We are trained to do it starting in college and continuing in industry.  It is more common for engineers to manage their own projects than for a project to get a PM assigned to it. \n\nIf PM doesn’t make sense to you, it is because you haven’t worked on enough projects. Those people who “are efficiently organized” or are “good at time/team management” are using PM techniques without realizing it. \n\nWhen I took that course, I wasn’t learning anything new, I was learning the names of the things I already knew and how to communicate with those who made decisions. The jargon is simply an agreed upon language that allows us to communicate and stay on the same page.",

Good luck, it is so hard.\" I completely psyched myself out for the exam by reading it. \n\nIf you have just a few years of work experience in project-based environments and you watch 1 video on equations, you can wing it and get AT on everything except for Agile.\n\nOf course these tools don't make sense to people who have never used them. I don't know anything about car engines and feel the same way looking at them lol.",

Summer of 2023: Said fuck it, buckled down and found a self-paced study guide with practice tests to prepare for the PMP 4 hour exam. Killed myself memorizing as much as I could.

Possibly an issue where the Cyber Team is stating something must be done 1 way and the \"boots on the ground\" are stating that such a configuration won't work in practical terms.  As the manager of that issue I would need to find \"middle ground\", one where each side can compromise on their stand.

They just add structure. That’s all they are.**\n\nAnd none of them are inherently right or wrong.

Pretending one framework fits all of that is lazy thinking from any academic.\n\n**The biggest issue I see in the industry is that we’ve inverted the logic. The framework is supposed to support delivery — not dictate it. Too often the delivery gets bent to fit the framework, instead of the other way around.**\n\nThe most effective projects I’ve seen treat frameworks as tools, not doctrine. You take what you need, discard what doesn’t help, and adjust as the work evolves.\n\nOnce a framework becomes something you’re not allowed to question, you’ve stopped managing a project and started following a belief system.\n\nStick at it if you can.

Project managers are problem solvers. \n\nYou have a customer that has a need fulfilled, you fulfill it. \n\nYou have a problem with a supplier holding up the project? Leverage your ability to withhold payment to help him solve his problem. \n\nYou have a problem with stakeholders who are impeding the work from being done? Use your leverage to get er done. \n\nAll the other fancy jargon with kanban boards and ishigawa charts doesn’t matter unless you’re required by your company’s policy. \n\nProject managing reminds me of the old Wild West when there were good Marshall’s out there upholding the law cause they believe in it, as opposed to the bad ones who make it look easy. \n\nGotta be a people person, problem solve and communicate.

But the role they play can vary WIDELY depending on the industry, company size, etc., so classes that try to scale to the full scope of this profession often feel super jargon-heavy and disconnected just like you’re describing. That was one of my biggest pain points with the PMP and I had to learn to study for the test without getting too hung up on real-life application. I know that’s a solution is also pretty frustrating, but it’s the only way I could preserve my sanity in a courses that try to be broad enough to capture everything so it ends up feeling like it teaches you nothing…. Does that make sense?",

They were either more complicated than necessary or out of date.  It made me wonder how long it had been since the instructors had worked as project managers, if the instructors had ever done more than teach project management.  One was teaching a book he had written that he was trying to promote to businesses as a new approach to use for estimating.  I hadn't heard of it before.  I haven't heard of it since.\n\nIt sounds like your teacher may have made the same mistake with her project management class that many leaders make when it comes to the projects they pursue - effectively communicating why it's needed, the problems it solves, and the benefits of pursuing it in a way that is meaningful to those involved.  Those three things might sound like I'm saying the same thing, but that would be like saying the colors scarlet and crimson are the same as the color red.\n\nIt doesn't help that project managers speak their own language which, in many cases is not even the same language business leaders speak.  There's some overlap, but it's heavily project and execution focused - more tactical than strategic.  Pardon me, it's more about how we get s4!t done, not why we're doing it in the first place.\n\nIt could actually be a good thing that your instructor is including AI in the course.  I won't say it's everywhere, but it's out there, available, and used by a lot of different roles, not just project managers, in tech and business related fields.  You might be able to choose to not use it after you graduate.  Maybe.",

I feel like I have to do everything on my team and it's thankless work. If I work less hours or take a break, I'm hust screwing myself over in the end because the work just continues to pile up and I get yelled at by the client. \n\nEach day I log off and I'm too mentally exhausted and depressed to enjoy any of the hobbies that used to bring me joy. I just wonder if I'm being a baby about this or if other people feel this way too. My current plan is to study for my PMP (I'm on day 2) and apply for other jobs in hopes that it will be different.

          "text": "Yeah that's not a good environment at all. It seems like this is a combination of lack of support from your bosses and you not setting boundaries with your team. Those are things you can control. With your team, delegate tasks that should be theirs to do and they're just being lazy about it. If it's directly related to the project paperwork then yes that's on you. But if it's stuff related to what your implementation or developer person needs to be doing then make them do it. Idk your background prior to being a PM, but for me I was in IT doing helpdesk to field tech to manager. So yes I can do the IT stuff but in my role as a PM I'm not going to because we have ppl for that role.\n\nFor your bosses, let them know that you're at your max capacity for projects and they need to hire another PM or they need to divide the work load better. If after directly telling them there is no change definitely start looking for other roles and leave that place in your rearview. Make sure to block out admin time for yourself on your calendar so you don't have meetings stack up. WFH ppl tend to forget that we also need breaks as if we were in the office, so treat it the same.",

It's very difficult to set those boundaries because ultimately, I am the face of the program and the blowback will be on me when we miss our milestones. I also feel for them because I know they're burning out too, it doesn't necessarily come from them just being lazy. \n\nI will say though that most of my stress comes from just having too much on my plate. The entry level PM they hired for me to delegate tasks to isn't up to the task yet, and she's been here six months already.

As an example back when I was an advanced PM and I had been allocated 18 active projects of various sizes and complexity, I was literally running from meeting to meeting all day and my administration work day didn't really start until about 4:30-5:00pm.  A colleague pointed this out to me because I just thought this was the norm, I escalated to the Program and Account Director my problem, long story short my workload was reduced to 8 projects with the client approval and priority, it taught me a very valuable lesson about my utilisation rate and understanding my capacity to manage it.

The wrong organizational structure can really taint your experience.\n\nI’ve left 2 companies after a short tenure due to burnout that was effecting my physical and mental health.  \n\nI just accepted a new job and I had my choice of accepting a position with 2 different companies.

The reason for us isn't because of the tasks, it's because of the amount of tasks they have made so much harder due to the requirement to use our internal system that takes a rocket scientist to figure out.  No joke, I hear this from the team that trains us on this software, \"this streamlines the process and makes it so much easier and faster.\"  That would be true IF I DID THAT F'ING PROCESS EVERY DAY ALL DAY! I ONLY NEED TO USE THIS F'ING THING ONCE EVERY 6 MONTHS! \n\nManagement uses a utilization metric for each projects PM hours sold.  They fill our project list up with these projects until we get to 36 hours/week of utilization.  What management fails to understand is that every project is undersold on labor. Every. Single. One.  This creates the problem because our bonus is tied to our projects financial health, so we will never report the actual hours we use on the project.  We will use all the hours until there are no more, then stop reporting hours on that project.  It creates a windfall because you now look underutilized so they give you more projects, and the cycle repeats itself.  One of the main issues I have is that management insists we inform them of projects undersold and the hours allotted, blah blah, they will help to fix it....nah, they suddenly become deaf and mute. \n\nI do feel this is an anomaly at my current org as my previous employer in the AV industry didn't have this problem.  There problem was just the lack of resources they would give me, and the amount of work they expected me to do for the money they were paying wasn't justified.  But it was less stressful than my current org.\n\n/rant\n\n  \nOP - I feel your pain. I have no words of wisdom or advice, but I'll cry along with you if it helps",

Do you have someone you can talk to?\n\nWhat you’re describing doesn’t sound unusual, but that doesn’t mean it’s healthy. \n\nIt may be controversial but working 45–50-60 hours or even more isn’t extreme in a project space **(doesnt mean its right)**, but working at full cognitive load all day, every day, with no pauses, is brutal. You need time for lunch and to think.\n\n**That’s not about hours — that’s about sustained pressure.**\n\nThe first step isn’t endurance. It’s clarity. \n\n* What are you explicitly accountable for? \n* What are you absorbing because no one else owns it? \n* Who actually has the authority to reduce scope, not just reshuffle it?\n\nIf those answers are fuzzy, no certification or role change will feel better — the pattern will just repeat somewhere else.\n\nIn my experience, PM roles become crushing when responsibility keeps expanding but authority and accountability doesn’t. You end up carrying the work, the client emotion, and the consequences, without being able to slow anything down or reset expectations.\n\nThat doesn’t mean *all* PM jobs are like this. But some environments absolutely are — especially client-driven, regulated ones where urgency never switches off and “capacity” is theoretical. Its tough!\n\nA PMP won’t fix that by itself. It can help you move, but the bigger question for your next role is whether the organisation actually manages workload and decision ownership, or whether PMs are just expected to absorb everything.\n\nI wouldn’t assume you’re weak or that PM just “*crushes souls*”. I’d be asking whether the system you’re in is sustainable for anyone long-term.\n\nHappy to share what my workload has looked like over time *(its not pretty)* — but I’m more interested in whether you have some support, or just being told to cope.",

Done well, they’re one of the most powerful levers leaders have to align work to strategy and drive change across the org.\n\nThe PMO should run intake and prioritization so approved work can start fast and everyone agrees on “what done looks like.” But that’s rare. In high-performing orgs, a strong sponsor and a solid business case are required to even enter intake. Sponsors do the homework because capacity is a strategic asset to protect, not something to squander. Half-baked ideas don’t make it to the meeting.\n\nMost places aren’t there. Projects get green-lit on napkin-math, then PMs and SMEs are told to “figure it out,” which creates resource conflicts, stuttered starts, and overruns.\n\n**My workaround:** have the PM build the brief (charter) as **living controls**, not a static doc:\n\n* **In/Out-of-Scope matrix** to keep change in check and feed into **Mobilization**\n* **RAID log**, reviewed weekly with clear escalation paths and audits\n* **Financial breakdown** (what we’ll spend, when) to surface variance early\n* **Guiding principles** to push decisions to where the work happens\n\nDo this and the PM shapes outcomes instead of playing order taker asking, “want fries with that?”",

Some folks have expressed worry that we will automate ourselves out of jobs - but that's not a good enough reason to stay away. They are going far enough to give quarterly bonuses out to the most creative and beneficial uses people are able to find. Having hardly used even ChatGPT for a handful of prompts, and no formal training, I am finding it difficult to wrap my head around what use cases the AI is going to actually do for me in my day to day. Right now it feels like the wild west with a small team and everyone trying to establish an effective setup to have AI agents with context only to specific contracts, and also make it collaborative. We are primarily using CoPilot and Loop\n\n  \nWe have a proprietary website portal that has AI agents with context to things like contracts, service tickets, etc. We also still heavily live out of Office for documentation and Teams for meetings and storage. We're setting up individual Teams channels for individual contracts to provide but also limit context for AI agents. So far the biggest benefit has been utilizing Facilitator to recap our brainstorming sessions, create our minutes and assign tasks, and then also reference those to create first versions of SOP documentation. I can wrap my head around that - take a conversation and create helpful process documentation quickly. But, I'm having trouble thinking of more use cases that will actually benefit me. ",

That said, a few things I've found actually useful rather than gimmicky:\n\n\\*\\*Stakeholder communication drafts\\*\\* - Not for the final version, but when I need to write a difficult email (scope creep pushback, timeline slip notification, etc.) I'll dump in the context and ask for a first draft. Saves me from staring at a blank screen for 20 minutes. I rewrite maybe 60% of it, but it gets me moving. ChatGPT or claude or whatever for this.\n\n\\*\\*Risk brainstorming\\*\\* - When I'm doing risk identification for a new project, I'll describe the project and ask what risks I might be missing. It won't catch everything, but it's caught a few things I overlooked because I was too close to the work. I use [rezonant.app](http://rezonant.app) for this.\n\n\\*\\*Translating technical stuff\\*\\* - When engineering gives me something dense and I need to explain it to business stakeholders, I'll use it to help simplify without losing accuracy (use Rezonant for this as well)\n\n\\*\\*Meeting prep questions\\*\\* - Before a kickoff or discovery session, I'll have it generate questions I should be asking. Again, not using them verbatim, but it jogs my thinking. ChatGPT or your LLM of choice for this.\n\nThe \"automate ourselves out of jobs\" worry is overblown for PMs specifically. The job (if you do it well) is fundamentally about relationships, judgment calls, and navigating ambiguity. AI is bad at all three. It's good at first drafts and brainstorming. Treat it like a junior analyst who works fast but needs supervision. \n\nWhat contracts are you managing? Industry context might help surface more specific use cases.",

The challenge was pulling the requirements out of a dozen + contractual documents that had significant cross linkages across the different projects in the program.  There was a fair bit of disagreement between the BAs on how to analyse and document requirements and the SMEs had never worked on a project like this so needed a lot of direction. \nGetting some options on how to tackle it and down into plain English that stakeholders could understand was very helpful and reduced the circular debating allowing us to pick a system and get on with it and refine as we went. \nOf course we never got the sufficient legal & contract support to clarify requirements fast enough, but that was a separate issue! 🙄",

I’m not technical and there’s a tense relationship between tech, business and PMs. Engineering staff will often try to pull the wool over my eyes with tech jargon - basically stalling or giving themselves “plausible deniability” for implementations. AI allows me to understand tech options in plain English - I use that to show the tech teams that I understand what they’re talking about. Smooths things over and restores the balance of power\n\n- Writing option papers for risks and issues. AI allows me to take large amounts of data and documentation and draft very brief summaries for problem statements and potential options. ***I ensure that I maintain editorial and content control - AI misses the nuances of my organisation*** but still very useful and time saving\n\n- The old favourite of transcribing meetings in Teams. I work across senior staff with their own agendas - tech / operations / support/ marketing / sales etc - AI allows me to focus on the content of the meetings, not the note taking\n\nThat’s me. It’s currently only really a support system, but great",

The client contact has a very hands-on management style, constantly requesting changes and adjustments, but then doesn't take responsibility when things don't go as planned. I'm now feeling incredibly frustrated and burnt out after initially being so excited to lead this account.\n\nEvery other day there's a new revision request. We'll spend hours implementing their feedback, then they'll change direction completely and act like we should have anticipated it. When deadlines slip because of all the changes, they blame our team. When the creative doesn't perform, suddenly it's our strategy that was off—even though we followed their direction exactly.\n\nI know I need to have a frank conversation with them about setting clearer boundaries and decision-making processes, but I struggle with talks that require me to push back and advocate for my team. I tear up and get emotional, especially with something like this that has been weighing on me for months. I'm afraid of jeopardizing the relationship or damaging my reputation if I lose control of my feelings, especially because my company values this account highly and I need to keep it together.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to have these kinds of tough conversations and manage emotions?",

Explain if any one constraint changes of either time, cost or scope change then the other two must change. Your question to your client is which one do they wish to change because the constraints are inter-relational and has causal effect.\n\nFor example, you're required to deliver a blue widget (scope) and the client now wants a blue widget with gold wings (scope change), great, you're happy to help but now that impacts on time and cost constraints. All you need to do is highlight the impact of that request. It's a straight forward conversation that you use with fact and fact only. \n\nThe thing is that it's not a personal when you use your triple constraint model because your client has to make the decision but you also get to find out very quickly if they're actually wanting the change when the reality sets on their change request and the impact that it holds for them. I also highly suspect that your client (s) are rough riding you because of your less seasoned approach. As a leader you need to show that you control your projects. \n\nAs you become more seasoned you will start to learn not to take things personally, it's quite common amongst more junior PM but you will find your voice when you have more experience. This is why using the triple constraint conversation is a great way because your client can't take it personally because it's a decision that they have made, so just keep on pushing out the time, cost and scope of the project when they keep on asking for changes, it's their responsibility and not yours, you're just there to facilitate the business transaction. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

Or if they sent over more feedback 2 days after they said their feedback was all in, I was always quick to respond with 'we've already started work on this round. If we move forward with implementing the changes in this round, our delivery date moves to X.' \n\n\nUnfortunately, I was frequently overridden by the executive on the account who ended up just saying we'd do it.

But I kept all receipts that I was clear with the client on the implications of their frequent deadline misses and feedback adjustments, which really covered my ass. ",

If you go in anchored on facts (what changed, how often and the concrete impact on timelines/costs), it stops being personal and starts being operational, which makes it much easier to stay steady.\n\nI’d also suggest writing down exactly what you want to say beforehand and sticking to it, almost like a script, when emotions spike, having those sentences ready helps you not spiral. And if you do get emotional, that doesn’t automatically ruin your credibility. Staying calm is ideal but being human while still clear and firm is usually respected more than people expect.",

Before moving to remote, I used to have a big kanban board, which worked perfectly.  At home, I tried kanban, but a post-it falling off and being eaten by a dog was a literal real problem.  This is the process I've landed on after a few years of iterating, and it works well for me:\n\nI keep the big to-dos/things I need to keep an eye on listed on the first page of my physical notebook, organized by project, with a miscellaneous section at the bottom.  Next to each item is a square that I fill in to show progress.  If something's urgent/high risk, I use a red pen.  Each week, I start a new page.  This keeps me focused on what is in motion, helps me prioritize, and creates a high-level weekly record of my work, which is helpful for annual reviews/checkins.  \n\nSome of the tasks or deliverables above will also live on the project boards that I share with my teams and stakeholders.  Those boards have different filters, including \"all tasks\", \"what's left to do\", and \"what should be started or done this week\".  I keep an eye on these a few times a week to keep our teams on track.  \n\nFor personal notes in projects, I use simplenote.  It's the only notetaking app I could find for Windows that is lightweight, allows simple categorization of multiple notes, and (most importantly) can be sized very small while still being useful.  I dedicate a small portion of my screen so it's always open.  I use OneNote for home projects, but it's too bulky for my professional use and doesn't play well when sized down.  \n\nFor important notes that will be shared with others, or notes that will be pretty much archived once recorded, we just dump those in word and store them in SharePoint.",

      "text": "worked at 3 different marketing agencies and they all have the same problem. campaigns are planned in slack, creative feedback happens in slack, client approvals happen in slack, but there's no good way to track all the interdependent deadlines that make a campaign actually launch on time.\n\nlaunch date is march 15th. that means creative needs client approval by march 8th. which means first draft needs to be done by march 1st. which means creative brief needs approval by feb 25th. all of these dependencies live in someone's head or scattered across slack threads.\n\ninevitably something slips. creative takes an extra 2 days. client approval takes 4 days instead of 2. suddenly you're launching late and the client is upset and everyone's pointing fingers about who dropped the ball.\n\nwe tried using monday for campaign management but clients aren't in monday, they're in slack. so all the real time coordination and decisions happen in slack anyway and monday just becomes this thing someone updates after the fact to create the illusion of project management.\n\nthere has to be a better way to manage campaign timelines when slack is where all the actual work coordination happens. agencies that figure this out probably have way better on time launch rates.",

You have to get decisions and action items in appropriate tracking. Whiteboards work. Project works. Primavera works. \n\nMonday and other new generation tools including Notion and Trello don't work well at all. Jira isn't PM at all no matter what Atlassian says. \n\nEmail is the best communication of record. You can export Slack decisions and actions to email. Using email templates you can connect email to PM including your plan, document management, action logs, risk register, etc. A good deal can be automated. \n\nIn your case, I'd prototype all your workflows on whiteboards to work out the bugs.

There was basically no onboarding to the company’s software outside of HR portals, and everyone works through the weekends or late at night in addition to 9-5. When I asked about onboarding, people from other departments just joked — “Onboarding? What’s that?”\n\nI’ve also seen 2 people mysteriously laid off in the short time I’ve been here, and I think that shrinking the team is the last thing we need. It seems very top heavy too, where the staff in my city consists of the C-Suite, a handful of account and media managers , then me, the project manager. My entire morning is full of meetings most days.\n\nMy boss seems to think I can magically whip out a timeline, asking me day one. I built one out the best I could, but the issue is that the client keeps changing things, takes forever to approve, then demands updates and information immediately. I’ve communicated multiple times that I cannot finalize timelines or project documents due to missing information from coworkers who are too busy to respond because they’re overbooked.\n\nI’m doing the best I can, but this new job has made me feel so defeated. At my last agency, I felt capable — I had the best client rapport from my team and was heading our project ops seamlessly for the most part. Now I feel completely overwhelmed at times and that I’ve chosen the wrong title.\n\nIs this normal? How do I get through while i look for another job?",

By week 3 I knew it was a huge mistake, after being onboarded to 6 large, legacy clients in 5 days, and being told I was being expected to kick-off and manage 10 new projects.... all before my first 90 days. It has been beyond overwhelming, and they were not transparent at all about any of this during my interview process. This is supposed to be an Intermediate PM job, and only pays 70k CAD per year (which is less than 50k USD per year for context.) \n\nI truthfully feel a bit setup, as they put me on the most challenging clients that no one else wanted to deal with. They had such lack of onboarding and high expectations that I think they just assumed I'd go above and beyond. They thought wrong .... \n\nI am looking for a new job, but in the meantime: I have been VERY transparent and honest every week, flagging the same concerns and risks both in writing and vocally. I have also been open about this being completely unrealistic workload & meeting expectations. I even went as far to tell them that these expectations wouldn't be ok for even a Senior PM role. Nothing is really being done, but they can't blame anything on me if I am flagging everything. I am also not going above and beyond ... either. Because of my workload, I sometimes have client emails that have to go unread for a few days, I am not responding to every Slack the same day (some I never respond to because there is just too many), and I have had to push out meetings by a week or two (meaning a project timeline has to get pushed) because I don't simply have enough time to do everything in my paid working hours. I do my best, but I close my laptop on time every day and I never work a minute of OT. If something isn't done, it can wait until tomorrow, or next week, or a couple weeks. I also decline any & every meeting that goes past my work hours. \n\nI have had to really work at \"not caring so much\" over the last 3 months and, just doing as best I can .... but also being ok with things dropping and not getting stressed over it. I have to remind myself that the company's lack of resource planning and poor workload management is not my problem to solve, and I am not the issue here.",

It reads like a setup issue. No onboarding, one PM, unstable scope, overbooked teams, leadership expecting certainty anyway. \n\nThat combination breaks people  - but its not uncommon. \n\nThe timeline issue is a symptom, not the problem. You can’t lock plans when inputs keep moving and approvals drag. \n\n**Anyone asking for a “final” timeline in that environment is really asking for reassurance, not accuracy.**\n\nA couple of things that might help while you’re there: \n\n1. Make assumptions visible, \n2. Tie dates to inputs you require but don’t control, and \n3. Stop owning client churn as personal failure.\n\nIs this normal in agencies? Unfortunately, yes in some. Is it how PM should feel everywhere? No. The fact you felt capable in your last role matters. Your ability didn’t disappear in three months. Will you need to work outside the 9-5 almost certainly. \n\nIf you’re looking elsewhere, I’d be paying attention to whether PMs actually get authority and accountability. Without that, the job just becomes pressure management.\n\n**You didn’t choose the wrong title. You landed in a messy system.**\n\nHope you're ok.",

I was in an almost identical spot at my last agency-the only PM, chaotic client, zero process, everyone burning the midnight oil like it was a badge of honor. It makes you question everything, but please know it's a *them* problem, not a *you* problem.\n\nWhat you described-timelines changing daily, radio silence from overworked teammates, then sudden client panic-is a leadership and process failure. You can't project manage in a vacuum. My survival move was to block my afternoons as \"focus time\" on my calendar (defend it ruthlessly) and send a single, concise Friday summary email to leadership laying out delays, blockers, and what I needed from *them* to move forward. It created a paper trail and shifted some accountability.\n\nHonestly, I started using CoordinateHQ there as a last-ditch effort to at least automate some of the client ping-pong and keep a central record of requests and changes. It didn't fix the culture, but it saved my sanity by taking the follow-ups and basic info gathering off my plate. It's built for this specific client-facing chaos.\n\nGetting through it: document everything, protect your time, and keep the job search active. You haven't chosen the wrong title; you've chosen the wrong company. A good agency will give you the tools and support to do what you're clearly capable of. This place just sounds like a burnout factory.",

Together with them, you explore the options available to you…how many people are they providing to the team?  What’s the desired delivery timeline and budget?  That’s your starter pack.\n\nWith that info, you get with the team to unpack the work.  You lead the process of determining how the team can get from point A (a new crew hearing about a new assignment) to point B (project delivered as requested) as predictably as possible.  The plan you all agree on here is your initial “happy path” project plan.  If you can’t even get to this point, you don’t really have a team ready to execute.  Work with your sponsor to settle that first.\n\nThen vet that initial plan with both the team and the sponsor/steering committee (together) to determine what could possibly take the team off the happy path.  Too much concurrent/competing work might pull team members away?  Risk.  Too much scope to deliver within the desired timeline?  Risk.  People or materials could turn out to be more expensive than planned?  Risk.  It’s on you to lead honest, open, fact-based discussions that surface these potential risks, determine how likely they are to occur, and articulate the impact they would have on that happy path plan if they do happen.\n\nWith all of that info, now you have what you need to facilitate the final round of decisions with your sponsors that will arrive at an acceptable plan to deliver work from point A to point B as predictably as possible, while avoiding the risks everyone agrees are likely to occur.  Document the agreements and make sure it’s super clear who on your leadership team you will turn to for help if/when any of those potential risks turn into actual issues, or if new risks arise.  This feels like the part that might be missing for you.\n\nNow you can kick off the project with your team to do the thing, the way you all agreed you would do it.  Set up whatever meetings or tools are needed for everyone to get what they need from each other.  Let the team tell you what they need…those meetings/tools are for getting the actual work done, not for updating you.  You should be able to gather your updates and build your status report from observing the work done against the plan, using the systems you set up (stand ups, Jira stories, whatever).  \n\nAs others have said:  as the PM you are way more than just a reporter.  If you’ve done the proper coalition-building and system-setting at the beginning and there is work that is so removed from your daily visibility that you have to nag for updates, you’ve either left a whole workstream out of your project plan, or you’re not close enough to the day to day activity on the project.",

The moment the constraint sits outside their authority — resourcing, priority clashes, risk exposure — time stops helping and delivery drifts. At that point, “letting it self-manage” is just deferring a decision.\n\nMy trigger is simple: ***if doing nothing for another week makes the decision harder or more expensive, it’s already an escalation and I go further in my projects. My role is to force that decision - enabling the project team to continue delivery.***\n\nTeams can manage work (most projects teams are put together because they are technical experts) what they can’t determine are competing executive interfaces and priorities.\n\nMaking that visible early and forcing a decision enables your project team to deliver.\n\nHope that helps.",

Now I'm here, I feel like I'm being annoying for always asking them an updates 😂\n\n>How do you feel about this? I feel like I'm contributing less compared to the technical project manager because they're always in deployment and he is joining them\n\nNone of this makes sense to me, or fits with my experience. \n\nWhy are you asking for updates? You set up process and people execute. If you have your head screwed on right (to be clear) you have updates due in weekly status on the same day timesheets are collected so that cost, schedule, and performance are synchronized. I like updates in email using templates so that everything just goes into PM tool and archived in accordance with law, regulation, and policy. I think that forcing ICs to interact with a PM tool for status is asking for trouble, high error rates, and noncompliance. No third party tools - templates are built into grown-up email tools. \n\nIf your project manager is technical what is your job and who is in charge? I don't know how anyone can manage something without understanding. That doesn't mean you have to be an expert in everything, but you need to have some subject matter expertise. I can't design a custom ASIC but I understand feature sizes, transmission lines, an foundry limits. I can design structural elements but it takes me three times as long as an expert IC. Software is easy. I can sit in on a code review in nearly any language and contribute. It helps to be a polymath. A firm grip on physics and moderately advanced math is important. Most of the promising people in my PM development track are ICs. The ones coming out of business administration and BA are career limited. \n\nPMs with no domain knowledge are like managers who say \"I don't need to be able to do anything, I'm a manager.\"",

What's traumatizing is when the non-technical stakeholder tells us it has to be done in a way that will not work or we lose our jobs, when we tell ourselves that we can design code to compensate for a poorly designed system or environment, or when somebody else decides that we will be denied the opportunity to connect to the knowledge necessary to create the solution in the first place (requirements).\n\nCode is just symbols on a screen. \n\nIt's the meaning we assign to the variable that matters. We need to learn the difference between true alignment of meaning, intention, and resources, vs.  performative alignment (the illusion of alignment without the reality of business resource alignment).",

It’s cold. Life sucked.\nThen the guy who owned the company cut the end of his thumb off with a circular saw. Not the tip mind you. A whole ass inch of his thumb. He didn’t yell. He asked for some napkins and duct tape. He patched himself up and went right back to work. He had no back up plan for falling behind schedule on the project. The contingency was keep working no matter what until it’s done.\n\nAnother time, I was working my way cross country on a motorcycle and I needed some money so I stopped in a town to camp and got a job that day doing dishes. The guy I worked with in the dish pit for those couple weeks was the happiest guy I ever met. He was a migrant from Ecuador. No amount of slop and mud could get him down. I was miserable. I asked him his secret. He told me that this was only one of three jobs he had washing dishes. He worked 7 days a week 12 to 18 hours a day. He was happy to do it because he was putting two kids through college and he knew they would never have to migrate to a different country to wash dishes to provide a better life for themselves. \n\nI highlight these experiences because whenever I see the current generations use words like traumatic when describing their high paying office jobs I assume they have zero perspective on what life could have been like for themselves had they zigged when they should have zagged.",

Reasonable people, decent data, good intentions. And yet… things still unraveled.\n\nWhat stood out to me is how early a lot of those decisions were locked in.\n\nWe talk endlessly about what decision was made. Feature A vs B. This market vs that one. This metric vs another. But we rarely talk about when the decision was made and whether the situation had actually settled enough to justify certainty.\n\nIn practice, early certainty feels productive. It gives teams something solid to rally around. It reduces anxiety. It makes planning easier. But it also freezes assumptions that haven’t had time to be challenged yet. Once something is decided, it quietly becomes expensive to question, even when new signals show up.\n\nI’ve seen teams spend months executing flawlessly on a direction that probably needed a few more uncomfortable weeks of ambiguity upfront. And by the time reality caught up, the cost of changing course felt higher than just pushing through and hoping for the best.\n\nIt makes me wonder whether timing is an underrated product skill. Knowing when to decide isn’t about confidence or boldness, it’s about sensing when the system has revealed enough of itself to make a decision that won’t age badly.\n\nHave you been burned more by bad decisions or by decisions that were simply made before the problem had fully shown itself?",

Working with the data you have to make decisions is something we do every day. \n\nThink about a simple transaction. Buying Steel for your project.  \nCompany 1. You have purchased from them for 10 years, and had less than \\~1% defect rate with consistent delivery on time.  \nCompany 2. You have purchased from for the last 10 years, but they are often 3-6 weeks late and have a defect rate of \\~3%.\n\nWhich would you choose if pricing is the same?\n\nCompany 1 seems like the safer choice, both from a quality and delivery perspective. So you choose company 1 for this project.\n\nBefore the steel ships there is now a 20% tariff on Canadian steel from company 1, where company 2 is US Based and would not have the tariff. \n\nYou made the best decision for the project based on the information available. You could have waited to make the order until later, but that would have added timeline risk. So in mitigating the timeline risk, you took on geopolitical risk that seemed smaller at the time. Small enough that even seasoned PM's would not have added it to a risk register.\n\nThe issue isn't that the decision was made too soon, or without enough information its that there is risk that can't be anticipated. Its called unknown unknowns and we deal with them everyday. If you think unknown unknowns are something you are immune to, I would point to 2020 and the pandemic. So many projects were impacted by something no one had on their radar.",

We are currently trying, for the third time, to build an internal project management system. The previous attempts failed due to bad architecture, very low adoption, and training that was basically bloated with technical jargon.\n\nThe same pattern repeating itself again. The main VP stakeholder leading the rollout has no technical background and wants to \"just build it and ship it\".  In company meetings, we keep identifying this \"rush now, fix later\" mentality as a one of the top toxic habits, yet leadership continues to ignore it in practice. (I recently read Dan Gardener's \"[How Big Things Get Done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3ecFezN2n4)\" book and it feels *exactly* like what we're going through).\n\nI’ve tried explaining that architecture is cumulative, but because backend work isn't \"visible\" like a dashboard, I don't think they value the planning phase as much. We constantly have to rebuild the architecture and spend enormous amounts of time recovering data, doing 'hot fixes', and more that take away from actually developing the system further.\n\nHow can I explain this to someone at a Director/Executive level to get the point across that the way we are planning, architecting, and executing the development of this system is like building a hacky Frankenstein? How do I convince them that \"slow\" planning now is the only way to avoid total paralysis later?",

Second when you say \"building a project management system with previous failed attempts\" whatcha building? This is a red flag for me; as in an organization that isn't succeeding at projects and has some translation gaps the first thing (and only thing) you need to start improving project management is religious project chartering. That doesn't require any resources to build, save maybe for an hour of time to create a reusable template. But it will reframe all of your current projects with correct stakeholder input from the start and clear lines to business strategy that will improve delivery without any project management tools. I personally would start there rather than a complex system that the team needs to take time to implement.",

I started getting frantic backchannel messages from my founder about how we were losing him hundreds of thousands of dollars a minute (also LOL).\n\nThe site was back up in 10 minutes, but he learned a \\_tiny\\_ lesson.
