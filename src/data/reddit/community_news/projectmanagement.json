      "text": "For most of my career I watched the same cycle repeat.\n\nSomeone gets hurt or nearly hurt. Leadership responds with more training. More signage. More toolbox talks. Crews nod along. The behavior doesn't change. Six months later, same incident, different person.\n\nThe one that finally broke the cycle for me happened on a remote pipeline job in northern Alberta.\n\nWe had a protocol: specific tools had to come from the equipment yard, roughly 200 yards from the active work zone. The safe procedure was clear. Walk back, get the right tool, walk back out.\n\nNobody did it.\n\nThey used whatever was within reach. Every time. We disciplined people. We retrained people. We posted reminders. The workaround persisted because the workaround was efficient and the procedure was inconvenient.\n\nThe fix wasn't more training. It was pre-staging tool kits at each work zone and eliminating the 200-yard walk entirely.\n\nBehavior changed immediately. Not because people suddenly cared more about safety. Because we stopped designing a system where the safe choice was the hard choice.\n\nWhat I eventually understood after 25 years in the field: the system chooses the behavior more than the individual does. If your procedure requires people to consistently choose inconvenience over efficiency, your procedure will lose. Every time.\n\nThe question that changed how I managed everything after that: are we asking people to do the right thing, or are we designing systems where the right thing is also the easy thing?",

Long story short about 3 weeks after implementing the change system we had a major outage and rather than taking hours, the on call engineer went to the change management system and found the problem in 20 minutes.  The hook was set because the team found benefits in the system but I also managed to get further benefits because I was able to get analytics from the system, the team turned the system in to a challenge of who could log the most change requests, this was a totally unexpected benefit but it also helped mold the team's organisational behaviour.  \n\nThis experience has been one of my biggest lessons in my professional career, if your system doesn't show benefit or you can't get buy in, you can't force users regardless of what you do. Work with your stakeholders to ensure that you have their input because it's part of the buy in process. Oh and the guy who gave me absolute grief, he turned out to be the biggest user of the system, I was making some huge assumptions on my behalf and one them thinking he was just being an a-hole but the funny thing he only wanted two minor things changed to make it more efficient for him (not such an unreasonable request at the end of the day). \n\nJust an armchair perspective ",

          "text": "This is one of the clearest examples of systems driving behaviour that I have seen in a while.\n\nFor years many workplaces respond to incidents with more training, more reminders, more signage. In a lot of the cases, people already know the procedure. The real issue is friction. If the safe or correct option is slower, harder, or inconvenient, the workaround will win almost every time.\n\nThe pipeline example captures that perfectly. The behaviour did not change because people suddenly cared more. It changed because the system stopped forcing them to choose between efficiency and safety. Once the right option became the easy option, the workaround disappeared.\n\nThat lesson applies far beyond that type of work. You see the same pattern in offices, healthcare, nonprofits, everywhere. Staff bypass clunky processes, skip steps that slow client response, and create informal shortcuts just to keep work moving. Leaders often treat this as a compliance or attitude issue, when it is really a design issue.\n\nThe question you ended with is the one more leaders need to sit with….. are we asking people to do the right thing, or designing systems where the right thing is also the easy thing?\n\nWhen systems are built around how work actually happens, behaviour changes without pressure, discipline, or repeated retraining. That is where real, lasting improvement comes from.",

Generally most PM's are over utilised because they get to be the stop gap to poor organisational policy, process or procedures but I also find PM's also don't actually push back either because they're being told by their management team it will be their responsibility.  \n\nI got taught one of my most valuable lesson when I was first starting out, I was faced with being highly over utilized in a new company I had recently joined and wanted to show I was a good employee. I had 18 active projects (yes, proper projects) of various sizes, complexity and costs and I would spend my whole day running from meeting to meeting and I would literally start my project administration work typically at 5:00-5:30 pm and I was usually working a 12-15 hour day. \n\nA peer of mine was concerned for my welfare and asked how was my workload being prioritised, I genuinely couldn't answer their question. His advice is something that I've never forgotten and one of my biggest lessons I've learned as a Project Practitioner and the question when being overloaded is to ask \"what goes on hold whilst I take on this higher priority task?\" and if you don't get an appropriate response then you start using your project controls of issues and risk logs and escalate to the project board/sponsor/executive to address. \n\nIn relation to my anecdotal story, I pushed back on to the Program Director and Account Manager with the simple question of priority. Long story short the proverbial hit the fan after the client was asked to provide a priority listing, the list was whittled down to 6 active projects and the rest were either placed on (in priority) hold or abandoned outright. This very experience taught me such a valuable lesson as a project practitioner because there is only so much one person can do, and I'm not the whipping boy!\n\nJust an armchair perspective    ",

          "text": "I've implemented Agile in several organisations.\n\nOne of the major tenets of any Agile implementation is that you need the buy-in of senior management. What are your senior management saying?\n\nPut simply, if it's your boss (or boss's boss) who has more sway, then your approach will win. If their boss has more sway, their approach will win. This has nothing to do with what is good for the business or the customers. This has everything to do with empire-building and who gets to look good.\n\nOne of the errors people make when implementing Agile is the belief that somehow, because Agile is iterative, that problems disappear. This is obviously nonsense. People seem to think that \"being responsive\" means that's it's fine to keep changing things all the time, thereby ensuring you have no clear product or \"definition of done\", and a pipeline that is full of senior managers' vanity projects.\n\nDeadlines still exist in Agile: they form a part of an item's priority. When you discuss work items with the Agile team, talk in terms of priority. If you need something done by a certain date, tell them that this deadline is a dependency, and that this should be factored into the priority of the item. You should allow the Agile team to break down your item however they want in order to achieve its delivery, but be clear that your ultimate deadline needs to be met.\n\nThe main difference between waterfall and Agile is that, in waterfall, the Product Spec is generally fixed. This makes sense since, if you are developing a high-rise building, you want to be clear about how much concrete you need to pour, when, and where it goes. Ask your Agile team how they intend to deal with this known problem. Ask it from a place of curiosity, not criticism. How will they ensure an Agile delivery of something physical? \n\nRemember, like every good American idea, the British thought of it first. DSDM predated Agile and was created to allow rapid iteration, something which is not possible in the construction world. Since you can't quickly iterate a data centre build, how will the Agile team adapt to ensure these things happen when they need to while still running an Agile operation?\n\nOne of the founding principles of Agile is transparency. Ask them to make their delivery pipeline visible to you, and all of their backlogs as well. Anything other than a Yes is deflection and is not Agile. Yes, they will want to control what their stakeholders see to some extent (they don't want you banging their door down every day) but they **must** be open to bringing you in to the process. The concept of \"silos\" is inherently anti-Agile.\n\nAnyway, I could wax lyrical on this for ages. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nCheers",

Whenever there's any request for scope change, or anything that affects the schedule, the backlog is up for renegotiation. It's just that it happens on a regular cadence instead of at a process-defined gates. In non-agile projects, it's more of a constant discussion about \"-Is this part of the requirements - of course it is! -No, that's not on a signed paper. -But according to our interpretations, it is! -But not according to our interpretation\", leaving the PM alone against the stakeholders. \n\n(sidenote: Many ppl think that agile implies scrum at a two-week cadence, but scrum only says 'less than a month', and imho, few actually follow scrum as it is defined. Scrum also assumes the team can work independent of other teams, preferably f2f, as long as the product owner keeps the backlog in order) \n\nHowever, I realize that when building prefab homes, there's less of changes and more of a factory-of-houses that's just assembled on the spot, and there agile methods have less of a benefit than when you're constructing bespoke buildings.\n\nEven with a gate-model, the gate criteria doesn't nesseccarily have to mean 100% done documents, it is often sufficient with \"roughly\" 90% and a risk list for the rest - except as required for regulatory reasons of course.\n\nI mean, you don't NEED to have every luminaries decided in order to give the go for digging the foundation, AS LONG as there is an understanding and respect for that the cost of the luminaries is not yet finalized and that it will have an impact on the final invoice. \n\nIf we look back at the agile manifesto, it actually states \"That is, while there is value in the items on\nthe right, we value the items on the left more.\".

If you want to reopen the discussion with the other team, you can appeal to the Scrum values: ***Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage***\n\nWhy should you look at these two things? \n\nIf you want to approach them, you should see what could be positive in the agile world. The Manifesto is 5 sentences and the Guide only 13 pages so it doesn't require a large investment. This will, hopefully, also show them that your open to new ideas.\n\nI believe there is a need for a change management approach in order to tackle this because it shouldn't come only from your side.",

Discuss each practice separately: how it can help or cause harm.\n\nTry to explain your processes to the other team and ask which one or two of their practices you can adopt to make your life better. Discuss them together.\n\nIf they are reasonable, they either suggest something that will work or understand that you have a different reality — win-win.\n\nIf they are not reasonable, then you have a problem :-)\n\nGenerally, I don't believe in a work by a predefined set of practices; I believe that each team should construct its own set  of practices for its own context.

A peer would land a great assignment and my first thought was \"why not me?\" Someone would share a win and I'd feel nothing. Or worse — a flicker of resentment.\n\nNot because I'm a bad person. Because the environment had trained it out of me. Years of zero-sum recognition, political promotion, and cultures where success is invisible but failure follows you for years.\n\nThe dangerous part is how slowly it happens.

          "text": "I did consulting work for a company where your pay was almost entirely connected to performance. \n\nEach concluded task resulted in getting points. Then the points determined your portion of a huge bonus pool. \n\nThere was a leaderboard of where everyone stood. This was hands down the most happy and productive place I've ever experienced. The only people who didn't flourish were those who came, sucked, and then left. That churn was high for new employees, but within a month or less most people knew if this was for them or not.\n\nThis could have resulted in a cutthroat Machivellian nightmare as people clawed and stabbed their way to the top of that leaderboard. But this wonderful term \"Confelicity\" definitely ruled. Once you showed that you were going to be a contributor, people wanted you to succeed. One simple reason was that everyone was given a clear view of the \"big picture\", meaning they saw the bonus pool size as coming from company success. So, if billy bob cooked up a killer feature and sales went up 5% because of that; people didn't care that billy bob got a huge bonus, as everyone else got a slightly bigger bonus as well. Fighting with billy bob would end up hurting everyone in the long run. Like the other baseball players begrudging the homerun king for \"taking too many home runs, he should share them. I hate my growing collection of world series rings.\"\n\nYou would now support billy bob in all his future endeavors, hoping he would hit another home run.\n\nI've explained, (as have the people who work there) how the system was completely amazing; and a huge number of people think they can point out endless flaws. But, the reality is that pointing out that it is impossible for bumblebees to fly. I won't argue aerodynamics, I will just point to the bees.\n\nThe only people for whom this place sucked were crappy programmers who, in most companies would rapidly become managers because they sucked so hard at programming. And just to shoot a common misconception. Junior programmers did find a home here as people would see their potential and mentor them. Also, the churn was so high, that they didn't select from \"top schools\" or any other BS. The programming interview was short, harsh, and was open to almost all takers. By harsh, I don't mean pedantic. But, had questions like, \"If you wanted to start a project with the most technical debt possible, what measures would you take?\" \"How does techncial debt present itself at the end of a project.\" \"What makes a good code review?\" and then they would often roast a person on their answer to this by asking, \"How does that add value and what would happen if you removed that from a code review?\" to nearly ever part of their answer.\n\nMy favourite on this one was when people almost always answered, \"Style guide, the code must follow a style guide or it is unreadable.\" \n\nThen, they would move on to the \"Find the bug\" portion of the interview where they would hand them a bunch of code with wildly varying styles. The bugs were generally easy to find, and not finding them would be a death cookie for the candidate. Then, they would ask, \"Did you have any trouble finding those bugs?\" The answer was usually no. And then they would ask, \"would you like to revisit your answer about style guides required to make code readable?\"\n\nWhile, the company did have a vague style guide, if the person rigidly held to the style guide as an important part of a code review, they were done as a candidate; as this clearly indicated the person had no idea how to work with others in a fluid give and take environment and required rigid rules to make communications possible. They clearly thought other people should have to follow those rules to communicate with them.\n\nThis last is the exact sort of person who would persist in arguing that bees can't fly. Also the sort of person who is technically capable of doing a thing, but will invariably do the wrong thing and make those around them miserable while doing it. No cofelicity to be found from that sort of person.\n\n\nVery little of the interview would confuse a junior programmer with any common sense.\n\nTo the somewhat subreddit topic. This company didn't have managers or PMs. There were the founders who provided a vision, and leadership; also through the points system, the incentive to work on what they wanted done. Then, under that it was a mob of over 200 people who followed that leadership. Within that mob some people worked reasonably independently, others were natural leaders and organized people who followed their lead as a team. This was all very fluid, but tended to form into little treehouses which were individually productive in their own way.\n\n\nI've seen the opposite. Not so much schadenfreude within the company, but it was such a cesspool of micromanagement, that when they have another round of layoffs, everyone who long ago left will ask, \"Did they finally fire James?\" or some other micromanager they hated. In this company there was no room for cofelicity as the managers stole all the successes, and nobody would congratulate them on their stolen valor.",

They were almost the equivalent of a year's salary. \n\nThen, one year everyone got something like 5k. Yet, the company profits were just as good as usual.\n\nIt turned out the managers had convinced the new head that they should allot bonus more for merit. In the months of planning who would get what, the managers just kept rationalizing giving themselves more and more and more. \n\nThe end result was the managers were told to hand the money back, and that maybe they would keep their jobs. If they quit and didn't hand it back, there would be a coming legal battle for them.\n\nThis didn't get most of the many employees who quit to come back. The relationship with the managers was now dead.\n\nIn this company, managers weren't paid more than those they managed. The company merged not long after, and then the whole merger died a dot com death.\n\nHad they not lost those people, and had they not merged; I'm not sure this company would have even seen a financial hiccup from the dot com bust.\n\nI think in most companies the problem is that people at the top really think they are the ones who make it rain. It is usually the team, with the occasional person who everyone knows is super valuable. A sales person who must be a jedi, a tech person who should be teaching at MIT, etc. But the reality is the bulk of people at all levels are helping, yet, managers on up are the ones taking as much credit as possible, and then rewarding themselves with as much money, privileges, etc as they can. There is no confelicity, in that too many accolades to other people might make them want more money, privileges, etc.\n\nA zillion years ago I knew the guy who built the entire computer system for a power company. (late 70s and early 80s). He was the guy. He invented, installed, configured, programmed, etc everything from scratch. He directly reported to the president, and was given a huge amount of leeway to do what he wanted, how he wanted. \n\nThen, the president changed, and annoited his son as head of engineering or CTO or something. The first day the son was there, he had this guy's office torn out. His \"office\" was beside the server room, which had to have their own clean cool environment. It was maybe 200 square feet. This guy showed up on Monday to discover the servers all sitting there on tables as the whole two rooms were an independent construction. He asked what the hell had happened when the son said, \"Only executives get offices, you are not an executive.\"\n\nHe did two things starting that morning. He reconfigured the power system so it would continue to function, but be 100% unmaintainable. He then started a company to sell all the things he had invented, created, etc to other power companies. Prior to that, they had been giving it away for free, as a free exchange. We give you this, you give us that, sort of thing. \n\nHe was minting it within months, and who knows how many millions it cost to replace all his unmaintainable stuff with GE gear? At least 10s of millions in 1980 dollars. It took him a week or two to make his mess and copy his work. He left without notice, or training anyone, the one person who did work with him as his apprentice (and backup) joined his new company.\n\nCompany culture comes from the very top.",

      "text": "Hey all, at the start of the year my team started looking for a new project management solution to track all of our work and act as a single source of truth and I was asked to look at what’s out there and put together a pros/cons list of each so we can make an informed decision. I ended up going pretty deep and felt like it might be useful to other teams.\n\nOur team lives in Slack (and we don’t want that to change) so I specifically focused on solutions with great Slack integrations. The dream was that we could keep working in Slack, but while having a one-stop-shop outside of Slack where you could see/manage everyone’s work. Sorry if you don't use Slack. Probably not relevant for you!\n\nThere are 100s of tools out there so I just focused on the top ones. Let me know if I missed anything important.\n\n# Summary Table\n\n|**Overall**|Overall|Ease of Use|Feature Depth|Slack Integration Quality|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|[Trello](https://trello.com/)|**4.3**|5|3.5|4.5|\n|[Asana](https://asana.com/)|**4.2**|4|5|3.5|\n|[Slack Lists](https://slack.com/blog/news/introducing-slack-lists)|**4**|4.5|2.5|5|\n|[Linear](https://linear.app/) (for dev teams)|**4**|4|3.5|4.5|\n|[Monday](https://monday.com/)|**3.8**|4|4|3.5|\n|[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) (for dev teams)|**3.8**|2.5|5|4|\n|[Todoist](https://www.todoist.com/)|**3.7**|5|2.5|3.5|\n|[Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/)|**3.7**|3|5|3|\n\n# Breakdown\n\n# [**Asana**](https://asana.com/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 4 / 5**\n\nAsana is easy once your team agrees on a simple “how we use it” pattern (projects, sections, owners, due dates). The friction shows up when people try to use every view/feature at once - you’ll want a lightweight default workflow and templates.\n\n**Feature Depth: 5 / 5**\n\nAsana is built for *structured project execution*, not just tracking tasks: dependencies, milestones, approvals, and multi-homing (same task in multiple projects) are first-class concepts. \n\nExample: if “Client approval” slips by 3 days, dependency chains make it obvious what downstream work gets pushed, and approvals keep “approved/rejected” explicit instead of buried in comments. \n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 3.5 / 5**\n\nStrong for capture + basic action: you can create tasks from Slack, and use /asana to list/create/complete/comment on tasks from inside Slack. \n\nBut it still behaves like “Slack is where tasks are born; Asana is where tasks are managed” - people will click through when work gets real.\n\n# [**Monday.com**](https://monday.com/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 4 / 5**\n\nTeams often like it immediately because it feels like a visual spreadsheet with statuses. The downside is consistency - if every client board is configured differently, adoption drops because nobody knows where to look.\n\n**Feature Depth: 4 / 5**\n\nMonday can absolutely do PM fundamentals like dependencies and critical path, but some of the more “true PM” features (milestones/critical path in Gantt) are plan-gated, and the system is more board/column-centric than project-logic-centric. \n\nExample: you *can* run a launch chain in a Gantt view with dependencies, but keeping that chain clean across lots of client boards usually turns into more setup/maintenance (columns, views, and rules per board) than in a tool that treats dependencies/approvals as core workflow primitives. \n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 3.5 / 5**\n\nThe integration supports “create items from Slack messages” and “send updates to Slack” patterns, which is the minimum viable Slack workflow. \n\nIn practice, it’s solid for notifications + capture, but not a “run the project in Slack” experience.\n\n# [**Trello**](https://trello.com/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 5 / 5**\n\nThis is the easiest tool here to get a team actually using, because it matches how people already think: “to do / doing / review / done.” If adoption is your #1 constraint, Trello is hard to beat.\n\n**Feature Depth: 3.5 / 5**\n\nGreat for lightweight workflows; less great when you need real sequencing, cross-project visibility, or lots of interdependent deliverables. Example: “Launch date is March 15 so creative must be approved by March 8” can be represented, but it’s not naturally enforced the way dependency-first tools handle it (you’ll rely more on conventions, checklists, and discipline).\n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 4.5 / 5**\n\nTrello is very Slack-friendly: create cards from Slack, preview links, and save Slack messages into Trello (including an Inbox flow). \n\nExample: a client drops feedback in a Slack thread - you can turn that message into a card immediately, then the PM sorts it to the right board/list later. \n\n# [**Todoist**](https://www.todoist.com/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 5 / 5**\n\nFast, clean, and extremely low friction. People will actually use it - but mostly for *their own* tasks.\n\n**Feature Depth: 2.5 / 5**\n\nTodoist is excellent for personal productivity and light coordination, but it’s not a full team PM system (limited portfolio reporting, dependencies, multi-stage approvals, capacity planning). Example: it’s great for “rewrite homepage headline by Thursday,” weak for “manage a 30-asset campaign launch with reviews, handoffs, and client approvals.”\n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 3.5 / 5**\n\nVery good at capture: you can convert Slack messages into Todoist tasks via the message menu, and complete tasks from Slack via /todoist. \n\nBut it won’t give you a shared “project heartbeat” inside Slack - it’s more “turn Slack into a personal inbox.”\n\n# [**Airtable**](https://www.airtable.com/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 3 / 5**\n\nAirtable is easy to *use* once built, but harder to *design* well. Most teams need an owner (ops/PM) to keep the base clean, otherwise it becomes “power-user magic” that nobody else touches.\n\n**Feature Depth: 5 / 5**\n\nThis is the most flexible system here: you can model clients, campaigns, assets, revisions, approvals, and link them together like a database. Example: one campaign record can relate to 40 deliverable records, each with status, owner, due date, and client approval state - that’s Airtable’s superpower.\n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 3 / 5**\n\nThe native Airtable ↔ Slack story is mainly “send updates/notifications into Slack via Airtable automations” plus link previews - not “turn Slack messages into structured records” out of the box. \n\nExample: “when status changes to ‘Needs client approval,’ post to #client-approvals” is straightforward, but the actual work still lives in Airtable.  \n\n# [**Slack Lists**](https://slack.com/blog/news/introducing-slack-lists)\n\n**Ease of Use: 4.5 / 5**\n\nIt’s native to where your team already works, so adoption is naturally higher than any external PM tool. Example: you can turn a message into a list item and keep the context in the same channel/thread instead of asking people to “go update the PM tool.” \n\n**Feature Depth: 2.5 / 5**\n\nLists cover the basics well (task, status, assignee, due date, custom fields, subtasks), but they’re still “lightweight tracking,” not full project management. \n\nExample: you can track a launch checklist and assign owners, but you won’t get the same depth as Asana/Monday around dependency graphs, portfolio-level management, workload/capacity, advanced reporting, or complex multi-project governance - and you can hit list size limits (e.g., 1,000 items on Pro/Business+; higher on Enterprise) that external tools don’t typically constrain in the same way. \n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 5 / 5**\n\nIt *is* Slack, so the integration is perfect and everyone already has access.\n\nYou can also add automation via Workflow Builder (e.g., remind assignees about upcoming/overdue tasks, or post periodic status digests into a channel), which is exactly what a Slack-first team usually needs.  \n\nMy one complaint is that the tabs of Lists, Canvasses, pinned comments etc. can become a little messy and disorganized.\n\n# Dev Tools\n\nI included these for completeness but really Linear and Jira are meant for developer teams (which isn’t us).\n\n# [**Linear**](https://linear.app/)\n\n**Ease of Use: 4.5 / 5**\n\nLinear is opinionated and fast - most teams can be productive quickly because the workflow is largely “pre-decided” (issues + projects + cycles). Example: you can convert a Slack message into an issue in a couple clicks, and it can keep a synced thread so stakeholders stay in Slack while work progresses. \n\n**Feature Depth: 3.5 / 5**\n\nDeep for *software execution* (issues, projects/roadmaps, cycle planning), but less of a general “team PM swiss army knife” than Asana/Monday. \n\nExample: Linear excels at “track bugs + ship features” workflows, but if you want highly customized approval stages per client, elaborate request-intake forms, or heavily tailored reporting for non-technical stakeholders, you’ll feel the limits of its intentionally simpler model.\n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 4.5 / 5**\n\nOne of the best “Slack capture → real tracking” integrations: create issues from Slack messages, keep comment threads synced both ways, and post channel updates (including notifications driven by custom views). \n\nExample: a client drops a bug report in #client-acme - you create a Linear issue from that message and the Slack thread stays synced as the issue gets updated/closed, so your account team doesn’t need a Linear account just to stay in the loop. \n\n# [**Jira**](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)\n\n**Ease of Use: 2.5 / 5**\n\nJira is powerful but heavy - it’s easy for creative/ops teams to bounce off because there are many concepts (issue/work types, workflows, fields) and the UI assumes process maturity. \n\nExample: two teams can have totally different “Done” definitions because workflows are configurable - great for control, bad for adoption if your team just needs “track work without ceremony.” \n\n**Feature Depth: 5 / 5**\n\nIf you need enterprise-grade process control, Jira is top tier: configurable workflows, rich work categorization, and hierarchy (work items → epics → broader planning), plus advanced planning/roadmapping for multi-team programs. \n\nExample: you can enforce that “Client Approval” cannot move to “Scheduled” unless required fields are filled and an approval step happened - Jira can make that policy unskippable, whereas lighter tools rely more on human discipline. \n\n**Slack Integration Quality: 4 / 5**\n\nJira’s Slack app is legitimately capable: notifications, link previews, and the ability to interact with work items from Slack (assign, transition, comment) and create work items from Slack messages/threads. \n\nExample: you can keep a channel subscribed to updates for a Jira project and let teammates transition an issue (e.g., “In Progress” → “In Review”) directly from Slack without opening Jira. \n\nThe catch is adoption: even with strong Slack controls, Jira only works if your team buys into Jira-style process and hygiene.\n\nIf I missed any big ones let me know and I'll add it",

From experience working across consulting and internal teams, I want to point out some concerns with Monday and Asana that often come up once teams scale.\n\nMonday looks clean at first but every team ends up building boards differently. This leads to confusion and a lot of time wasted figuring out how things are structured. There is no true system of record unless someone takes the time to clean and standardize everything. Without that, adoption starts to drop and the tool becomes more work than support.\n\nAsana has a stronger set of features but requires consistent discipline to use well. In most teams, people use only a small part of it. Things like approvals and dependencies sound good but rarely get maintained properly. It starts to feel heavy for teams that just want to track and move work forward.\n\nA tool like Celoxis is often overlooked but actually solves many of the real execution problems. It handles budgets, resource planning, timelines, and reporting better than most tools on this list. If you are managing real client work or tracking project health at the portfolio level, Celoxis is worth considering. It is not flashy but gets the core project needs right.",

Models themselves are capable of doing 99% of any white-collar job (hopefully I'm not getting hated by some \"domain experts\" who think the know-how in their brain is more valuable than a 1-trillion parameter SOTA model). People also hate on different benchmarks but they are good indicators of general/domain-specific intelligence. \n\nThen comes the elephant in the room, the app layer where you interact with AI. Think of the Co-pilot you've tested. There is so much to be optimized on the app layer, but you generally won't solve them with a stronger model (I guess theoretically you could when they are getting more advanced). The optimization comes mainly from understanding the specific workflows, good UI/UX, and better context management so there is less hallucination. \n\nI guess when folks say AI can't replace them, they are mostly pointing out at the mistakes AI might make as if humans don't make mistakes themselves. \n\n",

I know, I've spent a fair amount of time the last couple of decades leading IT and transformation programs to produce and implement that automation.\n\nToday's AI isn't intelligence. It's highly-optimized pattern-matching and next-in-sequence guessing. Specialized and optimized models just narrow the field for pattern-matching and the domain from which the next-in-sequence can be chosen.\n\nWhich is fine - when you get down to it, that also describes human intelligence. Humans just have a multi-billion year head start on development.\n\nFor a lot of white collar jobs, the vast majority of the work is working with people and working with uncertainty, two things AI is notoriously bad at. When you give AI a reasonably straightforward problem for which a clear answer already exists, it usually comes up with the right answer. Usually, because AI systems are non-deterministic; sometimes they will absolutely come up with the wrong answer, because the model generally has some amount of randomness built in, and that means it sometimes picks the lowest percentage answer instead of the highest. This is an oversimplification, but when you ask AI if 1+1 = 2, most the time the answer is yes. If you ask enough times it will tell you no.\n\nThat's nice, but the problem is that that the \"we already know the answer\" use case is already solved by rules engines that are deterministic. For a rules engine 1+1= 2, always. The challenge with rules engines is that the more you try to automate, the more rules you end up with as you try to account for every edge case. You rapidly approach the point of diminishing returns.\n\nWhat businesses are trying to do with AI right now is replace humans with non-deterministic AI models for the edge cases that are too complex for rules engines...and they're failing. They're failing because most of the time they're trying to solve use cases that require deterministic solutions. They're failing because they previously implemented deterministic solutions that also failed because they didn't address the underlying causes of those failures, which is decades - in some cases half a century or more - of disorganized data, business processes that only exist in the heads of a handful of people and are perpetuated via tribal knowledge, and absolutely massive piles of technical debt.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I use AI every day. There are a lot of places where AI saves me a ton of time in non-routine tasks, and there are definitely use cases where it is able to handle some of the time-consuming drudge work (meeting notes, etc). AI, implemented correctly, is much better than prior tools at searching and surfacing existing knowledge.\n\nIt's just bad right now at the business problems most people are chasing.",

Less labor cost and more revenue on paper. \n\nCompanies already have 10-15k workers on Microsoft 365. Microsoft adds copilot. 1000 users use copilot but the company reports 10-15k of their workers use AI. They also report 2000 layoffs (These layoffs would've happened regardless). \n\nInvestors see these two reports and buy more shares. Shareholder value increases. This is the reason you here these reports. They aren't trying to scare you they are trying to pitch this concept to the public which invests in their company. They want people to believe this because if it was true, why wouldn't you invest in such a sure thing\n\n",

          "text": "I like how confident my fellow PMs are whenever AI comes up. But I think the reasons most of you give for why you won't be substituted are based on the wrong mindset. The reality on the ground, especially in software companies, is already moving past this debate.\n\nCompanies that are seriously adopting AI tools are effectively eliminating the repetitive work that many PMs consider their core job. Status updates, Jira grooming, scheduling, stakeholder comms, report writing, risk registers. If that's the bulk of your daily value, you should be worried. Not in 5 years. Now.\n\nAnd here's what I think people in this thread are missing.\n\nLook at what's already happened to developers. In software companies that embrace AI, devs are now expected to work across multiple frameworks, handle full stack responsibilities, manage their own pipelines, and use AI coding assistants daily. The skill bar has gone up massively and team sizes are shrinking while output is growing. Developers had to adapt or get left behind. So why exactly do PMs think they're exempt from that same pressure?\n\nThe traditional PM toolkit, the methodologies, the ceremonies, all the frameworks we learned and got certified in, needs serious revision. Most of it was built for a world where coordination was expensive and information moved slowly. AI has collapsed that cost almost entirely. When an AI agent can summarize a standup, flag risks from commit history, generate status reports on its own, and keep stakeholders informed in real time, what exactly is the PM doing that justifies the seat at the table?\n\nAnd please, the answer can't just be \"soft skills.\" That's become a crutch at this point. The real answer has to be genuine strategic value. Making judgment calls when things are ambiguous. Actually understanding the product and the business deeply enough to challenge decisions. Navigating messy client relationships. Knowing a project is heading off a cliff before the metrics catch up. That's real PM value. But getting there means growing way beyond the mechanical coordinator role.\n\nI'm not saying we all disappear overnight. What I am saying is that the profession needs to evolve and it needs to happen fast. The PMs who will do well are the ones using AI right now to kill their own busywork and reinvesting that freed up time into thinking at a higher level. The ones who keep repeating \"AI is just a tool, it can't replace the human element\" without actually expanding what that human element looks like in practice? Those are the ones who'll find out the hard way.\n\nJust my two cents from someone working in software delivery who watches this play out every single day.

AI and automation in general can handle many standardised activities regardless of course. \n\nIf all your current PM role covers is repetitive administrative work then sure, you’d be right to be worried. That’s the easy side of PM though, and what most people think we do all day. It’s the same reason why the same people think we’re replaceable - they don’t appreciate what the job actually demands and what the hardest parts of it actually are: people.",

                  "text": "I hear you but I think you're proving my point without realizing it.\n\nYou say \"if all your current PM role covers is repetitive administrative work then sure you'd be right to be worried\" and then you say \"that's the easy side of PM.\" Okay but be honest with yourself, what percentage of your actual week is spent on that \"easy side\"? For most PMs, and I include myself in this, it's the majority. Status updates, board maintenance, chasing people for updates, writing reports, scheduling. That stuff fills the calendar. The strategic judgment calls and the empathetic client conversations, those happen what, a few times a month?\n\nSo when that majority of your week gets automated, what happens? Maybe you don't get replaced entirely. Maybe your company just doesn't need four PMs anymore. Maybe they need one who actually does the strategic stuff you're describing and lets AI handle the rest. That's not \"AI can't replace us.\" That's \"AI will replace most of us.\"\n\nAnd about the \"wheel out ChatGPT to explain to a client why you burned a month of budget\" scenario. Sure, a human has to be accountable. But that's one conversation. That's one moment. You don't get to justify an entire role and salary because once a quarter you have a hard conversation. Accountability isn't a full time job. It's a responsibility that sits on top of everything else, and if the everything else is gone, the math stops working in your favor.\n\nAlso the whole \"AI works best in stable environments\" argument was true maybe two years ago. These tools are evolving at a pace that most people in our field are not paying attention to because they're too busy updating boards and attending ceremonies.\n\nI'm not saying soft skills don't matter. I'm saying they're not enough to justify a position if that's ALL you bring. The PMs who will be fine are the ones who combine those human skills with actual strategic thinking, technical understanding, and the ability to deliver outcomes, not just manage process. The ones who just keep saying \"but empathy\" without evolving everything else around it are going to have a rough few years.",

Regardless of whether or not it *can* replace us, c-suite certainly thinks it can, and they make those decisions. \n\n\nNow, there are some caveats here. \n\n\nIn capital projects, I don't see much changing soon. Construction, defense, etc PjMs will be fine for a long time. \n\n\n\nSecondly, even though the *capabilities* are increasing quickly, the speed of uptake is still relatively slow. While software companies are making the switch, banks, CPGs, retail headquarters - these places are slow to adopt. Hell, I work at what is ostensibly a software company and a lot of what I do could be replaced with an Asana subscription and a couple of good Slack connectors, let alone AI. It takes months or even years for us to onboard new software, so change is slow. Companies will take awhile to catch up. \n\n\nThirdly, all of these tools rely on good data. While models are getting better and better at handling complexity, for these tools to work, everyone needs to do *their* job. They need document standardization, knowledge management... They need to update their trackers or tell their trackers to update themselves, etc. If real people really did this regularly, project and program management would have mostly died with MS Project. Yet, here we are. \n\n\nSo while I think we are absolutely going by the wayside, there will be a few year gap, and some of us will stick around. But there will be far fewer of us, and none at all in certain industries, I suspect. ",

Slack is the only common denominator so that's where cross functional coordination happens. And it's a disaster.\n\nLaunch requires engineering to finish the feature, design to create launch assets, marketing to write messaging, sales to train on positioning. Each team is managing their part in their own tools (Jira, Figma, HubSpot, Salesforce) but the dependencies between teams all live in random Slack threads.\n\nDesigner says \"waiting on final specs from engineering\" in Slack. Engineering finished specs yesterday but posted in a different channel. Designer doesn't see it, asks again 3 days later. Engineering is like \"we already posted it\" but now they have to re-explain where. Meanwhile marketing is blocked waiting on assets from design.\n\nThe handoffs between teams are where everything falls apart because Slack is terrible for tracking dependencies. Everyone is doing their part but nobody has visibility into the critical path so we don't realize we're off track until the launch date arrives and we're not ready.\n\nTried using project management software but getting 4 different teams to all maintain the same tool is impossible. Engineering wants Jira, design wants Notion, marketing wants Asana. So PM tool becomes my personal tool that nobody else touches.",

Because that's how so many of us got burnt out and went independent. \n\nOf lates, though, here in the USSA I'm dealing with an entirely different bullshit PITA problem. \n\nI went back and checked some notes in an ancient notebook, and confidently state that in this, the Year of Our Lord 2026, vendors take longer to respond to RFQs and RFPs than they did when we had to use telephones, FAXes, and the post office to get biz done. \n\nExample: A packaging manufacturer of specialty glass for medical devices would turn a quote request in 2 weeks in the early '90s. I'm 4 weeks out now, and they are making excuses and asking for two more weeks. \n\nExample: A custom corrugated company that I've used for a long time used to flip quotes around in 3 to 5 days. Now I'm waiting 2 weeks or 3 for the same information. \n\nExample: A material reprocessor that I've used a few times over the last ten years used to quote in 2 weeks. Now they require 4. \n\nCommon denominator: Thanks to Raygun's successful demolition of the Sherman Antitrust Act, each of the companies I mentioned has been rolled up into every larger companies and then finally merged into huge single-owner Private Equity nightmares. Ferinstance, there used to be about 50 distributors from which I could source packaging for medical devices and cosmetics. There are now 3, and for shits and giggles they've also locked the direct sourcing option out through contractual means.  \n\nIt ain't the people at the companies. They've just been reduced, right sized, reorganized, and de-skilled to the point that they can't do the job. I expect in the next round of \"efficiency\" the last skilled humans will be replaced with an AI chatbot. \n\nAnyway, my friends in China can get a complex device fully quoted in a week or two. Germany might take a few more. I'm *two* fucking months into trying to get numbers for a simple line of cosmetics. \n\nThank you for attending my TED Rant. \n\nAnybody else losing hair around these delays? \n\n",

Your last consideration is potentially looking at vocational training in order to assist you or even reaching out to your vendors for vendor training. \n\nAlso look at your training plan as part of your performance review, if that is if you have one. As mentioned you need to be actively managing yourself and not being a passenger on the bus because you will not learn or mature as a valued employee and that leaves you exposed on a number of different levels. \n\nJust an armchair perspective  ",

The expectation that you learn this in a few days is either ignorant or at best your superiors see a lot of potential in you and think you can manage. \n\nIn either case, I would hang in there. Rally up support as I said earlier, focus on what you can do, do your best, try to set boundaries where possible, just be overall reasonable and don't get sucked in by the overwhelm. In 6 months from now, when the project is over, you'll have learned a ton and all the discomfort will be forgotten.

People will sometimes get dissapointed with you, get married, you will get used to it. Deal with it. Just try to do better. If you get fired you will find another job, do not get too emotionally attached.\n4. Work efficiently, find a default format for emails, for reporting etc. Create an Excel that formats data so you can easily copy/paste the data in the other tools/trackers etc.\n5. Work with a todo list, in the morning write down what you will have to and mark a tasks as done, you will get that feeling of accomplishment, plus you can show your superiors what you did today/this week/this month etc.\n\nYou will get there!",

Is there a signed contract you can review? Start there. You need to know the what. \n\nThen find out if there is a project communication plan and stakeholder register. If these artifacts do no exist see if you can, get your hands on ones from similar projects. \n\nFigure out the project plan. Again is there an existing one or can you copy one? If this is waterfall, once you have the plan, execute against it. Get familiar with a RAID log and keep one. Find out who is making decisions on the project (make a RACI if it will be useful). \n\nIf none of these artifacts exist and your leadership do not support you in creating them and defining scope, etc. then you have an organizational problem. If you are a PM you are not a go-for and you're not admin assistant. You may want to make sure that you're not failing in expectations in part due to the fact that the org does not know what a PM is or is misleading you. \n\n\nIn my experience, as a PM you often work with Directors, VPs and Execs so you have to get comfortable with that. They will make decisions, provide resources and clear blockers. You need them on your team. There can be quite a bit of politics involved.",

          "text": "I consider expediting projects in a couple of ways: \n\n1. Speed up delivery (projects) by examining each element of the project to determine gaps, funnels and roadblocks and designing process solutions to streamline the project. \n\n2. Jumping into a project that is considered “troubled” and figuring out the fastest and most efficient/least cost solution to fix the project and hit the triple constraint. Or at least two of them. \n\n3. When a troubled project continues to devolve, then it can take drastic action to fix it, lest the project becomes “failed” and you risk customer relationships. This is when the original PM begins to reconsider professions and the team realizes that “evenings and weekends” are coming up. Sometimes people say that this is when you “crash” a project. Crashing a project is very intensive review of all ongoing and any remaining tasks to find opportunities to make the work get done faster. Bringing in more people, cutting tasks that risk project success, bringing in cots. Usually referred to as a “death march” project. \n\nI’ve done the first two and they can be fun challenges. I’ve been involved in a death march but not as project management (thank God). It isn’t fun. It isn’t pretty. I got fired over a conference call when I pointed out that a project was hitting the lacing of boots part of a death march. Luckily, the PM (who was a contractor - always a bad sign when you are *undertaking the single largest project the company has taken on, impacting sales, delivery and billing*) didn’t have the authority to fire me. \n\nIt sounds as if you have the right combination of technical skills, PM skills and desire to be successful.",

In most MRO or materials contexts, project expediting is about making sure long lead items actually move through procurement, fabrication, inspection, and delivery on time, spotting risks early and escalating before they hit the schedule. Yes, there is follow up involved, but the stronger expediters I have seen are reading schedules, understanding technical specs, and knowing when a delay is noise versus a real threat to the critical path. The caveat is that in some organizations it can lean more administrative if the process is rigid and transactional.

It’s not about accelerating the *scope* or project delivery in the broader PM sense. It’s vendor follow ups, checking on manufacturing progress, shipping timelines, customs holds, all that good stuff.\n\nIn reality, a lot of expediting is glorified chasing. Calling suppliers, reviewing logistics trackers, resolving weird delays like 'the crate was missing a customs form' or 'paint wasn’t dry before shipping.' It’s essential work, especially in capital heavy industries where a late valve or skidded unit can hold up a big commissioning date, but it’s rarely glamorous.\n\nThat said, if the role is manager level, it might give you visibility into supply chain risk at the portfolio level and let you build influence across engineering, procurement, and construction. Could be a decent stepping stone if you want to climb the PM ladder but still want to stay close to execution.

Team consists of 8 directors and 3 supporting roles: one just called senior manager (very vague?), Training Manager and Project Manager (me). Work of the team is very high level, which was new to me. Before this, I wourked on very much operation projects where there was logistics, finances, stakeholder management and it was very dynamic. \n\ni just realised that I have been here in this company for over one year without actually leading a project. They keep calling everything \"Initiative\" whether it's a project, process, action etc. Evrything is initiative and they are very high level, sometimes they \"go through\", sometimes nothing happens with them. Even though there is BP planning process for every new fiscal year, I feel this is more for directors and not for my involvement. And this whole process is chaotic as there are so many european & global teams and so many BUs and coordination is not the best. Then when FY starts I keep waiting to be given a proper project to lead, but looks like this year it will be the same as last year. Constant changes (now you have CAPEX, now it's not approved, now this initiative is not important as there is this new initiative that we need to prioritize that came in in the middle of the FY out of nowhere, how THIS initiative is very important BUT BUs don't have resources and don't want to work with eur/global teams...). If I am involved with one topic, project charter looks like this: project owner (head of the team, my bosses boss), project manager (my direct manager, one of the directors), project coordinator (me). I think this tells you where I am with \"leading\" the project. It's just small admin tasks that I do usually.\n\nAt this point I feel like a glorified secretary lol. There is just a huge amount of presentations that I help with, I contact partners & suppliers, organize in person meetings, schedule calls, reminders, take meeting minutes, communicate with BUs. I feel really sad with how it turned out. I would really like to work and contribute, but I don't know where does my role fit into this? How do I bring any business value?",

Good on you for wanting to organize the chaos. \n\nHow would you rate your organization's savviness and willingness to be organized?\n\nMy advice would be to meet your people where they are at. My own experience with low budget non-profits is that people really don't have much appetite or patience, and also not very tech savvy. Instead of leaning sophisticated project management methodologies, you really just need simple guiding principles to start. The more dead simple and obvious, the better.\n\n Things that I've seen work: \n\n- Being clear on the Who What When Where Why and How (I elaborated a bit more on it [here](https://victoriaenglert.com/running-organisations)). For every area is responsibility / task, this needs to be written down and accessible to everyone.\n- Starting with tools / platforms that people already know. Find better ways to maximize the use of those tools, only change when it becomes painfully obvious that a change is necessary (easier to get buy in in a flat organization). What would these be in your case? I've seen large communities run mainly via Whatsapp Groups and emails alone. Even pen and paper and a notice board worked really well. \n\nWhat are the specific issues with the organizational management that you face?",

Our organization also received a sustainability grant last year, so the board is ready for some change. We have just struggled to prioritize what we need.\n\nOur organization has a Google email address and uses the associated Drive to store documents.  Read/Write access is incredibly messy. We seem generally familiar with Google Apps. I prefer sticking to Google apps over Microsoft because it is free. We also use a platform called Chorus Connection, particularly for scheduling, music distribution, and internal communication. \n\nHistorically, the group has been run by 1 - 3 people who eventually get burned out and leave, resulting in giant access and knowledge gaps. The chorus has almost quadrupled in the last 5 years, and we are getting better opportunities. We need to spread out the load and scale up. The bottlenecks created by gatekeeping leaders has been one of the biggest challenges. Also, I am confident that well over half of the chorus are neurodivergent, and that adds to the chaos. We are terrible at \"Being clear on the Who What When Where Why and How\". I really want some kind of visual system that we can review and keep in a central location. Some tasks like social media posts or press releases before a concert, have a timeline element to them.  Others like a monthly newsletter would reset every.. month lol.",

                  "text": "Thanks for the elaboration! I used to be in a choir before as well so what you said brought back some memories. The chaos you've described is very common and very solvable. In your case I would do this in 3 layers: \n\n1. PEOPLR AND ROLES: Distribute responsibilities and formalize it with roles and titles. First write down a list of \"jobs to be done\", then cluster them into formal roles like \"Alto/soprano section leader\", \"Sponsorship Coordinator\" etc. Each must have a full list of responsibilities and mandates. Put this in an org chart. Open the roles up for application.\n2. FILING SYSTEM: create a centralized Google Drive that everyone has access to. In Google Workspace there is a \"org drive\" function, but I assume you are not using Google Workspace? If you're not then you have to design the structure and enforce it through communication. Define access rights send document this.\n3. TASK MANAGEMENT (visualization): I have some favorite organization task management tools like Clickup, and some of them have free versions. But they can also be very overwhelming. So to start, I'd suggest just going \"low tech\" and use things like Google Sheet (or even Google Slides). Put the projects, tasks in the sheet along with due dates, assignees, priorities, comments, date modified in the sheet. Important: pin the link to the sheet everywhere so it's easy to find. This is then the visual \"task board\". Once you all get the hang of it and are clear on what you need, then look for a more sophisticated tool.\n\nOnce these 3 things are set up, it would solve the most immediate chaos. Then you can move on to work on things like a team wiki for a better organization knowledge management and handover etc \n\nThat's it in a nutshell! Hope this helps! Of course, the devil is in the details. If you have more questions let me know.",

We recently had someone come present, what amounted to, project management fundamentals to our team. I was the only one with the PMP so a lot of it was familiar to me but not nearly as much as I’d like. Aside from my CE credits, are there any basic project management training refreshes out there? Id like to be more effective and highlight my PMP where I can but don’t feel comfortable doing that if I’m not sharp. ",

          "text": "\\*Gets on soap box and apologies for this upfront. \n\nIf you have remained consistently employed as a project practitioner for the last 10 years then I propose that refresh training is not needed because at the end of the day project management is a discipline and your PMP accreditation is based on a known framework (best practice) that has changed very little (tweaks only) in that 10 year period. I will be explicit here the way projects are delivered e.g. agile has changed and influenced but the framework itself has changed very little. \n\nAs an experienced practitioner what it comes down to is how you apply your framework and project approaches to a model, has your organisation fundamentally changed in it's project delivery? Has your organisation's project engagement model changed significantly?  Obviously with new tools like AI or enterprise software/platform solutions you could brush up on those skills. I would also query if you said \"agile\" being introduced but all that is only a different framework and as an experienced practitioner you should/would know how to deliver that or even if it was a hybrid model. \n\nBased upon my professional experience where I find most senior PM's tend to loose focus is on their people soft skills, strategic and business acumen skills because they've become complacent because they no longer ask themselves \"how can I do this better\" because they have fallen into the autopilot mode and tend forget about strategic delivery because they've gotten used to following the bouncing ball or have an over familiarization of delivery because at the end of the day a project management framework is meant to be repeatable. \n\nI strongly suggest to undertake an honest self assessment, a peer or even a 360 review of your current skillset. Most experienced practitioners do tend to understand their own strengths and weaknesses and that would be me suggesting on where you start but you need to ask yourself some hard and honest questions. I would also suggest get back to researching, reading, attending PMI local chapter meetings, networking and re-immerse yourself into the discipline from a technical delivery perspective and look at how you can improve your own project approaches.  You say you \"don't feel sharp\" why? What is preventing you from feeling sharp?\n\nPersonally I find that accreditation organisation's push for accreditation renewal because it's a revenue stream (Yes, my cynical nature), if you have been continuously employed as project practitioner, to me the re-accreditation process becomes a moot point because it's not like you get to a point in time and forget how to be a PM. All you need to do is extend on your existing experience and nothing more but your thirst for knowledge shouldn't diminish in finding a better way to deliver your projects as accreditation can't beat practical experience. \n\n\\*Gets off soap box ... sorry about that.

The benefits of my PMP are that if I’m in a room with more talented people managing higher visibility and larger projects I can keep up with what they’re saying. I can tell when people are sort of living and dying by the PM framework. Sometimes I laugh and just go “oh yes, they’re fresh off the exam!” But I guess I would just like to revisit it and see if there is anything I’m missing that I could implement to bring a little more esteem to my team and not have management feel like they need to bring in a professional to educate everyone on certain fundamentals. I’m very much a “whatever it takes to get it done” type PM but I have the opportunity to bring more to the table. Look what me and my PMP can do!",
