Enrolled in a Project Management class for my grad school program.\n\nThis shit is so abstract that monks would have trouble wrapping their heads around it.\n\nSo jargon filled that it makes L R Hubbard's engram see dollar signs.\n\nAnd the class is so fucking bad that I am losing my goddamned mind.\n\nAlot of fill-in-the-blank tests with the blanks being \"oo, sorry, 'common ground' would be incorrect. what we wanted to hear was MIDDLE GROUND.\" OR SENTENCES WHERE I CAN ONLY GET THEM RIGHT IF I EITHER MEMORIZED THE BOOK OR LITERALLY HAVE THE MATERIAL OPEN IN FRONT OF ME, and then, whats the fucking point?!\n\nThis professor had 20 quizzes due by the third day of an asynchronous class. It took me all night. And by the end I was ripping my mouse apart and performing self harm on my skull. I feel like I have a concussion today.\n\nAND SHE HAS IN THE SYLLABUS A RECOMMENDATION TO JOIN THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE!\n\nIf that institute is all this? Burn it to the fucking ground.\n\n\"Kanban\" \"Project Requisitiion coordinator\" \"Scrum\" as if they fucking have ever played rugby, or even met a rugby player. \"SAFe\"\n\nThe definitions are so self-congratulatory and confident in it's own neccesity. \"Adaptable, also known as Agile methodologies, allow for quick changes and...\" \"But Predictive models also do well in..\" \"But HYBRID models combine the best of both of them\" woooooo WHO WOULD HAVE FUCKING THOUGHT THAT NOT BEING STUCK IN ONE WAY OF THINKING WAS THE FUCKING POINT.\n\nDecision trees\n\nKanban Board Owners\n\nSTAKEHOLDERS. FUCKING STAKEHOLDERS. I CANT EVEN.\n\nI AM DONE. GODDAMN IT I AM DONE. I AM SO FUCKING DONE. I AM DONE. I WANT TO FUCKING CRY\n\nThere is not a genuine human emotion in this class, I feel like I was traumatized by the 80s man from Futurama. I'm vacillating between rage and wanting to cry.\n\nI'm sorry guys. I tried. But fuck project management.\n\nEDIT: Part of my rage could also be that she requires us to get a Chat GPT account, and my resolution for the year was to not use AI ",

I don't know what your degree is in, but if you're anywhere adjacent to corporate America you'll run into a lot of it anyways because you're almost certain to \\*work\\* with PMs.\n\nAll the people telling you you'll never use most of it as a PM are wrong. Am I trotting out PERT charts on a regular basis? Nope. Have I needed to because some exec thought it was \\*ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO BE SUCCESSFUL\\*...yes. If I didn't know what a PERT chart was it would have been hard to recover that relationship.\n\n Did I get an absolutely insane and guaranteed to fail project canceled once because I was able to sit down with the CFO and walk them through a Monte Carlo simulation of possible outcomes, where \"bankrupting the company due to fines and legal fees\" was more likely than \"meeting all objectives\"? Also yes.\n\nExactly once in my two decade+ career for both of those tools.\n\nYou're being shown a toolbox full of tools. Some are going to sit on the bottom of that toolbox 99% of the time. Knowing what and when to pull out the right tool is key. KNowing what all the tools and what they do is where that starts.\n\nAll the tools and jargon in the world are useless if you don't know how to use them and don't have the soft skills that are the core competencies for PMs...but if somebody says \"can you put a slide together showing the critical path as a GANTT chart, with annotations showing the key cross workstream dependencies and significant risks so we can share it with the executive stakeholders,\" you had better be able to parse it.",

I have an undergraduate in electrical engineering and I work as a test engineer in manufacturing. \n\nMy EE GPA was 2.14. I had a rough time in college and I will probably never go back for a masters. \n\nMy Grade for the 3 semesters of PM courses?  100% each semester. \n\nPM makes a lot of sense once you’ve worked on projects and have seen the tools in use. Once you’ve seen the pain points and what the tools are used for, they make sense and when you learn about them in class it is just putting a name to something that feels very obvious. \n\nWhat I saw in that class was that not all PM are engineers, but all engineers understand PM. We are trained to do it starting in college and continuing in industry.  It is more common for engineers to manage their own projects than for a project to get a PM assigned to it. \n\nIf PM doesn’t make sense to you, it is because you haven’t worked on enough projects. Those people who “are efficiently organized” or are “good at time/team management” are using PM techniques without realizing it. \n\nWhen I took that course, I wasn’t learning anything new, I was learning the names of the things I already knew and how to communicate with those who made decisions. The jargon is simply an agreed upon language that allows us to communicate and stay on the same page.",

Actual applied project management is rarely anything like PMI or formal courses make it out to be. PMI is big into the alphabet soup game and unnecessarily dogmatic about a variety of topics. \n\nIn my opinion/experience, the classes are just educated suggestions and real project management is mashing up some of that stuff with communication and common sense. \n\nAll of that said… I’m also getting the vibe that this may not be the path for you.

They just add structure. That’s all they are.**\n\nAnd none of them are inherently right or wrong. The problem is the way we treat them as identities: ***“we’re Agile”***, ***“I’m a Scrum Master”***, ***“we use SAFe”*****.** At that point the framework becomes the point, not the outcome.\n\nThe reality is that every project has different risk, uncertainty, constraints, and stakeholders. Pretending one framework fits all of that is lazy thinking from any academic.\n\n**The biggest issue I see in the industry is that we’ve inverted the logic. The framework is supposed to support delivery — not dictate it. Too often the delivery gets bent to fit the framework, instead of the other way around.**\n\nThe most effective projects I’ve seen treat frameworks as tools, not doctrine. You take what you need, discard what doesn’t help, and adjust as the work evolves.\n\nOnce a framework becomes something you’re not allowed to question, you’ve stopped managing a project and started following a belief system.\n\nStick at it if you can.

They were either more complicated than necessary or out of date.  It made me wonder how long it had been since the instructors had worked as project managers, if the instructors had ever done more than teach project management.  One was teaching a book he had written that he was trying to promote to businesses as a new approach to use for estimating.  I hadn't heard of it before.  I haven't heard of it since.\n\nIt sounds like your teacher may have made the same mistake with her project management class that many leaders make when it comes to the projects they pursue - effectively communicating why it's needed, the problems it solves, and the benefits of pursuing it in a way that is meaningful to those involved.  Those three things might sound like I'm saying the same thing, but that would be like saying the colors scarlet and crimson are the same as the color red.\n\nIt doesn't help that project managers speak their own language which, in many cases is not even the same language business leaders speak.  There's some overlap, but it's heavily project and execution focused - more tactical than strategic.  Pardon me, it's more about how we get s4!t done, not why we're doing it in the first place.\n\nIt could actually be a good thing that your instructor is including AI in the course.  I won't say it's everywhere, but it's out there, available, and used by a lot of different roles, not just project managers, in tech and business related fields.  You might be able to choose to not use it after you graduate.  Maybe.",

I feel like I have to do everything on my team and it's thankless work. If I work less hours or take a break, I'm hust screwing myself over in the end because the work just continues to pile up and I get yelled at by the client. \n\nEach day I log off and I'm too mentally exhausted and depressed to enjoy any of the hobbies that used to bring me joy. I just wonder if I'm being a baby about this or if other people feel this way too. My current plan is to study for my PMP (I'm on day 2) and apply for other jobs in hopes that it will be different. But I'm afraid it won't be different at other companies and this is just what it's like.\n\nSo my question is, what is your job like? Do you like it? Do you feel supported it?

Those are things you can control. With your team, delegate tasks that should be theirs to do and they're just being lazy about it. If it's directly related to the project paperwork then yes that's on you. But if it's stuff related to what your implementation or developer person needs to be doing then make them do it. Idk your background prior to being a PM, but for me I was in IT doing helpdesk to field tech to manager. So yes I can do the IT stuff but in my role as a PM I'm not going to because we have ppl for that role.\n\nFor your bosses, let them know that you're at your max capacity for projects and they need to hire another PM or they need to divide the work load better. If after directly telling them there is no change definitely start looking for other roles and leave that place in your rearview. Make sure to block out admin time for yourself on your calendar so you don't have meetings stack up. WFH ppl tend to forget that we also need breaks as if we were in the office, so treat it the same.",

It's very difficult to set those boundaries because ultimately, I am the face of the program and the blowback will be on me when we miss our milestones. I also feel for them because I know they're burning out too, it doesn't necessarily come from them just being lazy. \n\nI will say though that most of my stress comes from just having too much on my plate. The entry level PM they hired for me to delegate tasks to isn't up to the task yet, and she's been here six months already. It's not really her fault though, I'm expected to train and mentor her myself. It's just mismanagement all around. I'm just one person",

When you become more seasoned the penny will drop about roles, responsibilities and accountability and I assure the light-switch will turn on because if you keep on burning out then the lessons are not being learned. \n\nYou will learn to prioritise and sort out the priorities (risk and impact) from the noise but you also need to help yourself and at the end of each day you need to go through your \"to do list\", cross off what you achieved for the day and what you need to do tomorrow with a priority. \n\nYou also need to be conscious of your utilisation rates and when you're swamped ask your manager a simple question \"what goes on hold and what gets delivered\". As an example back when I was an advanced PM and I had been allocated 18 active projects of various sizes and complexity, I was literally running from meeting to meeting all day and my administration work day didn't really start until about 4:30-5:00pm.  A colleague pointed this out to me because I just thought this was the norm, I escalated to the Program and Account Director my problem, long story short my workload was reduced to 8 projects with the client approval and priority, it taught me a very valuable lesson about my utilisation rate and understanding my capacity to manage it.

Each day, make a list of everything you think you need to do. Make a pass through the list and see what you can delegate because a team member can also do it. Make a pass through the list to see what you can say \"no\" or \"not now\" to. Then focus on the remaining tasks. You sound like you might be someone who feels ownership and takes responsibility when you shouldn't. This process of reminding yourself to delegate and say no can help you be conscious of this risk and avoid piling your plate when you don't have to.",

Occasionally I’d even run out of anything to spend much time on, but that was rare. It depended heavily on what kinds of goals and commitments my area of the business was accountable for at the time, and how much scrutiny would be on us, etc. \n\nMy suggestion would be to start setting some stronger boundaries with people and understand how much leverage you’ll have with that. You might be spending time on stuff you could easily be passing to others. If you’re someone who owns everything, people love that but will take advantage of it more and more, causing your bandwidth to get strained constantly. \n\nIf you find that the business is very dependent on you, I think you’ll find that they’d tolerate you pushing back on deadlines or turning down assignments when you can communicate a solid justification for it. “Sure, I can prioritize A to deliver by end of week, but to do that I’ll need to take some extra time on B.” \n\nProtect your bandwidth and make a habit of it so you don’t burn out.",

The reason for us isn't because of the tasks, it's because of the amount of tasks they have made so much harder due to the requirement to use our internal system that takes a rocket scientist to figure out.  No joke, I hear this from the team that trains us on this software, \"this streamlines the process and makes it so much easier and faster.\"  That would be true IF I DID THAT F'ING PROCESS EVERY DAY ALL DAY! I ONLY NEED TO USE THIS F'ING THING ONCE EVERY 6 MONTHS! \n\nManagement uses a utilization metric for each projects PM hours sold.  They fill our project list up with these projects until we get to 36 hours/week of utilization.  What management fails to understand is that every project is undersold on labor. Every. Single. One.  This creates the problem because our bonus is tied to our projects financial health, so we will never report the actual hours we use on the project.  We will use all the hours until there are no more, then stop reporting hours on that project.  It creates a windfall because you now look underutilized so they give you more projects, and the cycle repeats itself.  One of the main issues I have is that management insists we inform them of projects undersold and the hours allotted, blah blah, they will help to fix it....nah, they suddenly become deaf and mute. \n\nI do feel this is an anomaly at my current org as my previous employer in the AV industry didn't have this problem.  There problem was just the lack of resources they would give me, and the amount of work they expected me to do for the money they were paying wasn't justified.  But it was less stressful than my current org.\n\n/rant\n\n  \nOP - I feel your pain. I have no words of wisdom or advice, but I'll cry along with you if it helps",

Do you have someone you can talk to?\n\nWhat you’re describing doesn’t sound unusual, but that doesn’t mean it’s healthy. \n\nIt may be controversial but working 45–50-60 hours or even more isn’t extreme in a project space **(doesnt mean its right)**, but working at full cognitive load all day, every day, with no pauses, is brutal. You need time for lunch and to think.\n\n**That’s not about hours — that’s about sustained pressure.**\n\nThe first step isn’t endurance. It’s clarity. \n\n* What are you explicitly accountable for? \n* What are you absorbing because no one else owns it? \n* Who actually has the authority to reduce scope, not just reshuffle it?\n\nIf those answers are fuzzy, no certification or role change will feel better — the pattern will just repeat somewhere else.\n\nIn my experience, PM roles become crushing when responsibility keeps expanding but authority and accountability doesn’t. You end up carrying the work, the client emotion, and the consequences, without being able to slow anything down or reset expectations.\n\nThat doesn’t mean *all* PM jobs are like this. But some environments absolutely are — especially client-driven, regulated ones where urgency never switches off and “capacity” is theoretical. Its tough!\n\nA PMP won’t fix that by itself. It can help you move, but the bigger question for your next role is whether the organisation actually manages workload and decision ownership, or whether PMs are just expected to absorb everything.\n\nI wouldn’t assume you’re weak or that PM just “*crushes souls*”. I’d be asking whether the system you’re in is sustainable for anyone long-term.\n\nHappy to share what my workload has looked like over time *(its not pretty)* — but I’m more interested in whether you have some support, or just being told to cope.",

Pay attention to things like which projects and operations initiatives get funded vs don't, what executives ask about vs ignore, metrics that impact decisions, and where risk is accepted vs addressed.  \n\nLearn how to frame things in business language, instead of project management language.  This can be hard when you've poured the PMBOK Guide into your brain, but execs rarely speak in PMBOK.  They speak in terms of tradeoffs, impacts, and outcomes.  The concepts can be similar but they get expressed differently.\n\nIf you can find a mentor at your company it could prove helpful.  You can also check if your local PMI chapter has a mentorship program, but it's hard to say if they'd have a mentor for business acumen.\n\nI pursued my MBA early in my career, which helped expose me to a lot of the concepts.  One of the challenges, however, was that I was too junior and wasn't exposed to how they were applied at work.  That took time and experience.  Once you start intentionally learning business acumen, begin intentionally applying it as well.  Examine your projects and ask:\n\n* What does this project enable, protect, or reduce?\n* What happens if we don't do it?\n* What is the cost of delay?\n* Who benefits?  How?\n\n...and build decision-feedback loops into your decisions:\n\n* Make a decision\n* Write down your assumptions and expected outcomes\n* Once the outcomes are known, ask yourself, \"What did I miss?\"\n* Evaluate why you missed it and what you can learn from the experience\n\nWash, rinse, repeat - this will help you develop pattern recognition while refining important skills.",

Key concepts are as follows: \n\n**Individual behaviours -** you need to understand what motivates and drives individuals and how their personal traits, values attitude influence their behaviour and is the most complex to understand because you start taking on basic psychology understanding. \n\nA good place to start is finding out if people are generally intrinsically or extrinsically valued and some project practitioners may agree or disagree and use some psueudosience principles such the the Myers Briggs 16 personality types and how they interact within the team and organisation. Also the DISC Theorem which is based upon 4 personality types (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and Conscientious) and how it influences team building dynamics. The last is the Alan Tuckman’s stages of group development (forming, storming, norming, performing) model. These are all starting points for your consideration and I have found the extremely useful when trying to understand project performance delivery. Is it bullet proof, no but it provides insights to common individual and corporate behaviour. \n\n**Group dynamics -** you need to study on how people interact within the team, how they communicate, how and who leads and the most important is conflict resolution and how they approach that. This comes down to observation and leading back to individual behaviour and how they influence group dynamics particularly those disruptors within a team, the key is to understand their motivation. \n\n**Organisational culture -** It’s the tone that the organisation sets, what values and beliefs and practices it has and how it shapes organisational policy and how it behaves. But most importantly on how it impacts employees. \n\nThe reason on why Org Behaviour needs to be understood by project practitioners because it facilitates understanding, performance and the most important thing that it facilitates is change. \n\nJust a spitball on a very broad subject and if you want to become a great PM, this is the very reason on why EQ skills are extremely important as a project practitioner. I hope that gives you a bit of insight. ",

Ensuring you go through your to do list every afternoon prior to leaving work and crossing off your achievements for the day and knowing exactly what you need to do the first thing the next working day, it becomes your daily planner. It's a discipline and you need to work at it but when you do a lot of \"perceived project management issues\" get addressed. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

Someone asks for “just 5 minutes” and from the outside it looks harmless. Non-dev folks (and honestly, sometimes PMs too) assume productivity drops for five minutes and then snaps right back to normal.\n\nBut the red line in this drawing is the real one. The meeting itself is short. The recovery is not.\n\nThat dip isn’t about the meeting content, it’s about context. You pull someone out of a mental model they’ve been building for an hour, maybe more. When they come back, they’re not picking up where they left off, they’re reconstructing. What was I doing? Why was I doing it this way? What was the next risky part? That rebuild time is invisible but it’s where most of the cost lives.\n\nWhat I find interesting is how this creates a quiet disconnect between roles. From a PM perspective, the calendar still looks efficient. Five minutes here, ten minutes there. From the team’s perspective, the day turns into a series of productivity cliffs. Nobody feels like they’re blocking work, yet work keeps slowing down.\n\nThe “just one task” version of this is even sneakier. A tiny request dropped into chat feels smaller than a meeting but it does the same damage. It fractures attention, then pretends nothing happened. Multiply that by a few times a day and suddenly people feel behind without being able to point to why.\n\nThis has made me rethink how I treat interruptions. Not in a “never talk to anyone” way but in a “is this worth resetting someone’s brain?” way. Because once you see productivity as a curve instead of a switch, a lot of normal PM behavior starts to look surprisingly expensive.\n\nHave you found ways to protect focus without turning into the PM who says “no” to everything? Or is this just one of those costs we all absorb and pretend isn’t there?",

Before moving to remote, I used to have a big kanban board, which worked perfectly.  At home, I tried kanban, but a post-it falling off and being eaten by a dog was a literal real problem.  This is the process I've landed on after a few years of iterating, and it works well for me:\n\nI keep the big to-dos/things I need to keep an eye on listed on the first page of my physical notebook, organized by project, with a miscellaneous section at the bottom.  Next to each item is a square that I fill in to show progress.  If something's urgent/high risk, I use a red pen.  Each week, I start a new page.  This keeps me focused on what is in motion, helps me prioritize, and creates a high-level weekly record of my work, which is helpful for annual reviews/checkins.  \n\nSome of the tasks or deliverables above will also live on the project boards that I share with my teams and stakeholders.  Those boards have different filters, including \"all tasks\", \"what's left to do\", and \"what should be started or done this week\".  I keep an eye on these a few times a week to keep our teams on track.  \n\nFor personal notes in projects, I use simplenote.  It's the only notetaking app I could find for Windows that is lightweight, allows simple categorization of multiple notes, and (most importantly) can be sized very small while still being useful.  I dedicate a small portion of my screen so it's always open.  I use OneNote for home projects, but it's too bulky for my professional use and doesn't play well when sized down.  \n\nFor important notes that will be shared with others, or notes that will be pretty much archived once recorded, we just dump those in word and store them in SharePoint.",

They couldn't take it the wrong way and it wasn't personally and it was the impact of their choice because they didn't define their requirements properly.

There was basically no onboarding to the company’s software outside of HR portals, and everyone works through the weekends or late at night in addition to 9-5. When I asked about onboarding, people from other departments just joked — “Onboarding? What’s that?”\n\nI’ve also seen 2 people mysteriously laid off in the short time I’ve been here, and I think that shrinking the team is the last thing we need. It seems very top heavy too, where the staff in my city consists of the C-Suite, a handful of account and media managers , then me, the project manager. My entire morning is full of meetings most days.\n\nMy boss seems to think I can magically whip out a timeline, asking me day one. I built one out the best I could, but the issue is that the client keeps changing things, takes forever to approve, then demands updates and information immediately. I’ve communicated multiple times that I cannot finalize timelines or project documents due to missing information from coworkers who are too busy to respond because they’re overbooked.\n\nI’m doing the best I can, but this new job has made me feel so defeated. At my last agency, I felt capable — I had the best client rapport from my team and was heading our project ops seamlessly for the most part. Now I feel completely overwhelmed at times and that I’ve chosen the wrong title.\n\nIs this normal? How do I get through while i look for another job?",

          "text": "I am in a similar boat and also in an agency setting. I am close to 3 months into a new job that was a complete bait and switch. By week 3 I knew it was a huge mistake, after being onboarded to 6 large, legacy clients in 5 days, and being told I was being expected to kick-off and manage 10 new projects.... all before my first 90 days. It has been beyond overwhelming, and they were not transparent at all about any of this during my interview process. This is supposed to be an Intermediate PM job, and only pays 70k CAD per year (which is less than 50k USD per year for context.) \n\nI am looking for a new job, but in the meantime: I have been VERY transparent and honest every week, flagging the same concerns and risks both in writing and vocally. I have also been open about this being completely unrealistic workload & meeting expectations. I even went as far to tell them that these expectations wouldn't be ok for even a Senior PM role. Nothing is really being done, but they can't blame anything on me if I am flagging everything. I am also not going above and beyond ... either. Because of my workload, I sometimes have client emails that have to go unread for a few days, I am not responding to every Slack the same day (some I never respond to because there is just too many), and I have had to push out meetings by a week or two (meaning a project timeline has to get pushed) because I don't simply have enough time to do everything in my paid working hours. I do my best, but I close my laptop on time every day and I never work a minute of OT. If something isn't done, it can wait until tomorrow, or next week, or a couple weeks. I also decline any & every meeting that goes past my work hours. \n\nI have had to really work at \"not caring so much\" over the last 3 months and, just doing as best I can .... but also being ok with things dropping and not getting stressed over it. I have to remind myself that the company's lack of resource planning and poor workload management is not my problem to solve, and I am not the issue here.",

I would say youre not alone, most senior Project Managers have experienced something similiar during their career. \n\nAt a high level are you actually getting any space to think, or is it just constant reaction to issues?\n\nFrom the outside, this doesn’t read like a capability issue. It reads like a setup issue. No onboarding, one PM, unstable scope, overbooked teams, leadership expecting certainty anyway. \n\nThat combination breaks people  - but its not uncommon. \n\nThe timeline issue is a symptom, not the problem. You can’t lock plans when inputs keep moving and approvals drag. \n\n**Anyone asking for a “final” timeline in that environment is really asking for reassurance, not accuracy.**\n\nA couple of things that might help while you’re there: \n\n1. Make assumptions visible, \n2. Tie dates to inputs you require but don’t control, and \n3. Stop owning client churn as personal failure.\n\nIs this normal in agencies? Unfortunately, yes in some. Is it how PM should feel everywhere? No. The fact you felt capable in your last role matters. Your ability didn’t disappear in three months. Will you need to work outside the 9-5 almost certainly. \n\nIf you’re looking elsewhere, I’d be paying attention to whether PMs actually get authority and accountability. Without that, the job just becomes pressure management.\n\n**You didn’t choose the wrong title. You landed in a messy system.**\n\nHope you're ok.",

It is great for PDUs (continuing education) and if you want to develop more skills there are good resources. Also, It does give you access to a local chapter, which you may have additional fees to join. \n\nHowever, an employer won’t care that you’re a Member and unless you have the personality and location (major city) to network heavily, and even then, I don’t think you will see an ROI on it without a cert.\n\nIf you are looking for a new job, I do highly recommend getting your PMP. Most places I’ve worked for treat it has equal priority to a degree. Maybe look at scholarships for continuing education? Or if you have Agile experience then the CSM or PSM can be cheaper and easier to get.",

I asked him his secret. He told me that this was only one of three jobs he had washing dishes. He worked 7 days a week 12 to 18 hours a day. He was happy to do it because he was putting two kids through college and he knew they would never have to migrate to a different country to wash dishes to provide a better life for themselves. \n\nI highlight these experiences because whenever I see the current generations use words like traumatic when describing their high paying office jobs I assume they have zero perspective on what life could have been like for themselves had they zigged when they should have zagged.",

Reasonable people, decent data, good intentions. And yet… things still unraveled.\n\nWhat stood out to me is how early a lot of those decisions were locked in.\n\nWe talk endlessly about what decision was made. Feature A vs B. This market vs that one. This metric vs another. But we rarely talk about when the decision was made and whether the situation had actually settled enough to justify certainty.\n\nIn practice, early certainty feels productive. It gives teams something solid to rally around. It reduces anxiety. It makes planning easier. But it also freezes assumptions that haven’t had time to be challenged yet. Once something is decided, it quietly becomes expensive to question, even when new signals show up.\n\nI’ve seen teams spend months executing flawlessly on a direction that probably needed a few more uncomfortable weeks of ambiguity upfront. And by the time reality caught up, the cost of changing course felt higher than just pushing through and hoping for the best.\n\nIt makes me wonder whether timing is an underrated product skill. Knowing when to decide isn’t about confidence or boldness, it’s about sensing when the system has revealed enough of itself to make a decision that won’t age badly.\n\nHave you been burned more by bad decisions or by decisions that were simply made before the problem had fully shown itself?",

Working with the data you have to make decisions is something we do every day. \n\nThink about a simple transaction. Buying Steel for your project.  \nCompany 1. You have purchased from them for 10 years, and had less than \\~1% defect rate with consistent delivery on time.  \nCompany 2. You have purchased from for the last 10 years, but they are often 3-6 weeks late and have a defect rate of \\~3%.\n\nWhich would you choose if pricing is the same?\n\nCompany 1 seems like the safer choice, both from a quality and delivery perspective. So you choose company 1 for this project.\n\nBefore the steel ships there is now a 20% tariff on Canadian steel from company 1, where company 2 is US Based and would not have the tariff. \n\nYou made the best decision for the project based on the information available. You could have waited to make the order until later, but that would have added timeline risk. So in mitigating the timeline risk, you took on geopolitical risk that seemed smaller at the time. Small enough that even seasoned PM's would not have added it to a risk register.\n\nThe issue isn't that the decision was made too soon, or without enough information its that there is risk that can't be anticipated. Its called unknown unknowns and we deal with them everyday. If you think unknown unknowns are something you are immune to, I would point to 2020 and the pandemic.

In addition it's not a great professional look either.  \n\nI always do a project synopses document (or snap shot) which is a general project overview and quick reference document which has the following as mandatory:  \n\n1. Overview \n   * Time \n   * Cost \n   * Scope\n   * deliverables \n   * Milestones\n   * Interdependencies \n2. The Top 5 lists  \n   * Top 5 Issues and Risks \n   * What is the immediate top 5 deliverables (e.g. what is next on the schedule that they need to concentrate on)\n   * Key stakeholders (majors only) \n3. A financial breakdown \n   * Clear forecast figures \n   * Clear acutals figures (this is extremely important to ensure that you don't throw any dead cats here)\n4. Project objectives and benefits (this one may sound odd but I see this get lost in translation all the time)\n5. Key project stakeholder roles and responsibilities e.g. the go to people like architect, project board and who makes good coffee, the important project relationships.  \n\nWhen it comes to project documentation artifacts I like to be organised (some people have been known to say anal retentive) so when it comes to handover I'm confident that the newly incumbent PM has everything they need, the synopsis document is just a quick reference guide only and it's generally no longer than a two pager document because things start getting lost in translation. \n\nThe key thing to remember as a professional courtesy is to make yourself available during the transitional period, I have lost count on how many times if seen PM's cut and run from a project that they knew that was a dead cat and to be honest it annoys the hell out of me because they would be the first to complain if it happens to them. \n\nJust an armchair perspective.",

That said, the clients I’m working with so far seem genuinely nice and reasonable, which definitely helps.\n\nIn the role, I’m responsible for overseeing multiple projects for our company’s largest client, and it’s very client facing. A big part of my time is spent working directly with the client, managing expectations, aligning on priorities, and translating client needs into clear actions for delivery teams.\n\nWe also work closely with a key third party partner who handles most of the hands on execution. My role sits in the middle, acting as a bridge between the client and the external consultants, making sure timelines, dependencies, risks, and deliverables stay on track.\n\nBut yeah, so far, the focus feels very much on coordination, prioritisation, communication, and delivery oversight.\n\nA few things I’d love advice on:\n\n* What separates an average project manager from a good one in a heavily client facing role like this?\n* how do you handle situations where a client gets upset or frustrated? Any practical tips for de escalating and managing those conversations without damaging the relationship?\n* What habits, frameworks, or tools should I build early to avoid becoming just a “to do list manager”?\n* For those who moved from consulting into PM, how did you make the role feel more strategic and impactful?\n* Longer term, is this type of PM and client management experience viewed positively career wise?\n\nThanks :)",

If you don’t know the answer to a question or a concern, tell them that you will find out and give it a time box. \n\n— keeping on top of schedules and since you have a 3rd party doing a bunch of the work, keeping on top of all the resources assigned to do the work \n\n— having a good grounding in PM skills.

If you end up in a role that you are managing vendors, you have insight into how that world works as well.  \nClear, open, and honest communication are great. Bad news does not age well, share challenges and risks asap to address and develop mitigations.  \nUnder promise and over deliver. Always have a 5-10% contingency that you don't share with the client to account for emergencies. It allows you to almost always be on time. Please note, that when you go beyond a 10% contingency you can be accused of sandbagging a client. Imagine if you complete on a Monday vs Wednesday deliverable is great, but not 1st of the month delivery vs end of month delivery. One gives reasonable slack to account for illness/delays, the other slows the project down by breaking the schedule.\n\nDeescalation of client often involves getting them to describe the problem, you reformat and repeat back the problem in your own words to ensure understanding, then ask them what a reasonable solution to the issue is. You ask for their solution first to anchor expectations. If its doable, do it. If its unreasonable, offer reasonable or workable solutions.",

That requires judgement, not templates.\n\nWhen PMs aren’t empowered to do that, they default into status reporting and risk containment. The project stays busy, the dashboards stay green, but nothing really moves.\n\nDelivery improves the moment decisions are explicit and escalation is treated as part of the work, not a failure of leadership or communication. Without that, the PM role slowly collapses into narration — and narration doesn’t deliver projects.\n\n**The best Project Managers Enable Project Delivery - not project management.**",

      "text": "My background is in Data Science and PM. I manage a technical team at a medium-sized company with low tech literacy. We are currently trying, for the third time, to build an internal project management system. The previous attempts failed due to bad architecture, very low adoption, and training that was basically bloated with technical jargon.\n\nThe same pattern repeating itself again. The main VP stakeholder leading the rollout has no technical background and wants to \"just build it and ship it\".  In company meetings, we keep identifying this \"rush now, fix later\" mentality as a one of the top toxic habits, yet leadership continues to ignore it in practice. (I recently read Dan Gardener's \"[How Big Things Get Done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3ecFezN2n4)\" book and it feels *exactly* like what we're going through).\n\nI’ve tried explaining that architecture is cumulative, but because backend work isn't \"visible\" like a dashboard, I don't think they value the planning phase as much. We constantly have to rebuild the architecture and spend enormous amounts of time recovering data, doing 'hot fixes', and more that take away from actually developing the system further.\n\nHow can I explain this to someone at a Director/Executive level to get the point across that the way we are planning, architecting, and executing the development of this system is like building a hacky Frankenstein? How do I convince them that \"slow\" planning now is the only way to avoid total paralysis later?",

Second when you say \"building a project management system with previous failed attempts\" whatcha building? This is a red flag for me; as in an organization that isn't succeeding at projects and has some translation gaps the first thing (and only thing) you need to start improving project management is religious project chartering. That doesn't require any resources to build, save maybe for an hour of time to create a reusable template. But it will reframe all of your current projects with correct stakeholder input from the start and clear lines to business strategy that will improve delivery without any project management tools. I personally would start there rather than a complex system that the team needs to take time to implement.",

In our case, the changes got so out of control that we started seeing pretty significant bugs pop up with every (weekly LOL) release.

For 3 weeks in a row, our weekly deploy introduced new, critical bugs on production. And in week 4, the whole site went down when we deployed. I started getting frantic backchannel messages from my founder about how we were losing him hundreds of thousands of dollars a minute (also LOL).\n\nThe site was back up in 10 minutes, but he learned a \\_tiny\\_ lesson. He finally brought in better technical leadership and they were starting to make a plan for long-term stability, but I left before it went anywhere. I doubt it did.",
