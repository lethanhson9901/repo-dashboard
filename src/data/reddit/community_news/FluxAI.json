On Runpod I replaced the distilled int8 model with the [distilled nvfp4 model](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-9b-nvfp4), replaced the load int8 node with a regular load diffusion model node, and removed torchcompilemodel. Int8 models: [https://huggingface.co/aydin99/FLUX.2-klein-4B-int8](https://huggingface.co/aydin99/FLUX.2-klein-4B-int8).\n\nI've been wondering if I should upgrade from a 3090 to a 50 card. On the 3090 I use Klein 9B int8, and on a 5090 Runpod instance: Klein 9B nvfp4. Same comfyui workflow, using the in-paint crop and stitch node on 1536 x 3424 images for in-painting. Overall it was on average 2x faster, \\~20 secs on the 5090 and 30-40 on the 3090, little quality difference.\n\nI don't feel like its worth upgrading. These were quick and dirty tests, but tell me your thoughts.",
