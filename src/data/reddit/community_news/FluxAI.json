      "text": "I'm on a 3060 12GB, 32GB RAM. unsloth's Flux.2 Klein 9B Q8\\_0 is 9.98GB. Flux.2 Dev has a Q4\\_K\\_M for 20.1 GB. Considering that Klein is already a distilled model, does \"distilling it twice\" by making a quant of it cause enough degradation that I'd be better off just using a different base model? Would the Dev Q4 be too much for my system to handle practically? Am I better off just going with a 4B model for speed generation and then i2i with a higher model for quality later?",

          "text": "Use Flux.2 Klein 9B if you want speed and quality.  \nUse Flux.2 Dev if you want to use LoRA.\n\nQuantization and distillation are two different things:\n\n* Quantization is converting a model to a lower dtype, compressing its size.\n* In distillation, a model is trained in fewer steps. In Klein's case, this makes it capable of inferring in 4 steps (non-distilled needs 50 steps), but the size remains the same.",

Then i just mixed the best parts from different generations and added AI generated music.\n\nThis workflow is still not perfect but it is getting there and improving a lot.\n\nI made a full tutorial breaking down how i did it step by step: 👉 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzLS5L4VgN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzLS5L4VgN8)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you have a better workflow for keeping consistency in AI commercials, i'd love to learn!",
