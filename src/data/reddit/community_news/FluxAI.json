      "text": "Here’s a straightforward explanation of how Forge works on [Fiddl.art](http://Fiddl.art) for training custom Flux models. Forge allows you to create your own reusable model based on images you upload, so the system can learn a subject, style, object, or environment in a more consistent way.\n\nThe process starts by uploading images into Forge to create a training set.\n\nGood training sets typically include:\n\n* clear images\n* minimal filters\n* decent lighting\n* a consistent subject or theme\n\nThese images are what the model will learn from.\n\nOnce the dataset is ready, you set up a new custom model. First, you select your training set. Afterwards, you select the Flux base model:\n\n* Flux Dev — useful for faster testing and experimentation\n* Flux Pro — balanced realism and detail\n* Flux Pro Ultra — highest detail and fidelity\n\nNext, you select the Training Mode, which defines what kind of learning the model prioritizes:\n\n* Subject — best for portraits, characters, and living beings, focused on identity and likeness\n* Style — learns a specific artistic look or mood\n* Object — ideal for products and physical items where structure and detail matter\n* General — a flexible mode for environments, architecture, and mixed content\n\nThen you choose the Model Type:\n\n* Normal — a lighter training mode, generally suited for smaller datasets\n* Advanced — a deeper training mode that works best with larger, high-quality datasets\n\nAfter selecting the Base Model, Training Mode, and Model Type, you start the training process. Forge then trains a custom Flux model using your dataset and settings.\n\nOnce training is complete, you can generate images using your new model while maintaining consistency in identity, style, structure, or scene characteristics, depending on how you trained it. This is useful for things like:\n\n* consistent portraits or characters\n* product or brand imagery\n* repeating an art style\n* worldbuilding\n* storytelling projects\n\nInstead of depending on reference images every time, you work from a reusable trained model.\n\nMore info on this blog: [https://fiddl.art/blog/en/forge-tool-train-custom-ai-models](https://fiddl.art/blog/en/forge-tool-train-custom-ai-models)",
