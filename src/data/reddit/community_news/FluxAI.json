You say download the models for free here, linking to civitAI. But there is no FLux2 klein model to download on civit. But there is another link to your patreon where it can be downloaded for free after you join there. yeah.\n\nPlease, at least have the decency to announce that your lora is available on your patreon (maybe even free tier? I dont bother .... ). But don't announce it to be free for download when it isn't.",

Then i just mixed the best parts from different generations and added AI generated music.\n\nThis workflow is still not perfect but it is getting there and improving a lot.\n\nI made a full tutorial breaking down how i did it step by step: 👉 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzLS5L4VgN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzLS5L4VgN8)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you have a better workflow for keeping consistency in AI commercials, i'd love to learn!",
