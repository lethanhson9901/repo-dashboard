I select all, and give a descriptive prompt like this, but it does not look high quality or like an editorial shot, and it still always places the umbrella in the wrong place, can someone tell me what I am doing wrong? Any tutorials on SETTING/SCENE would be so helpful. Prompt below, result is attached:\n\n*Place this umbrella exactly as is without changing any details of the umbrella, directly behind an outdoor wooden 10 foot couch with pastel green cushions. The couch sits directly in front of the umbrella. The umbrella is behind the couch. There are two tan rattan chairs with light coral cushions on either side of the couch. The couch and two chairs are on an outdoor rug that is light yellow. The rug is extending off the frame on either side. The couch in front of the umbrella is facing the camera, and the two side chairs are facing inward. The seating area is about 10 foot by 10 foot in dimension, and the umbrella is large and dominating in scale to the seating area, dominating in scale over the seating area and staying in relative height to the couch. The seating area is on a light cream ceramic tiled outdoor floor. The umbrella provides natural shade onto the entire seating area. This is the only umbrella in the shot. The setting is at a quaint, boutique pastel pink Miami hotel outdoor terrace with tropical greenery throughout the terrace. Behind the umbrella and seating area is a lush tropical walkway path leading to the hotel. The hotel entrance lobby is indoor/outdoor open and on the right. It is midday with natural light, and defined shadow contrast under the umbrella, casting shade onto the couches, balanced exposure, and rich golden highlights. Photorealistic HD wide-lens camera with high dynamic range and controlled highlights.* \n\n*View from very slightly below, natural light, contrasting. Even, balanced exposure with no controlled highlights. Bright, clear colors. Clean white balance and vivid but natural color saturation. Defined, crisp shadows directly under objects for contrast. High clarity, sharp detail, and polished. HD wide-lens camera look with high dynamic range and controlled warm highlights*.\n\n",
