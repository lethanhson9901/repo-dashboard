      "text": "I’ve been messing around with changing art styles with  img2img in Flux.2 Klein, and I’ve noticed that while it can transfer a lot of image detail in stunning fidelity and quality, often facial features and expressions don’t transfer and must be prompted in. Positive expressions generally look good with a simple prompt, but negative expressions are often over-exaggerated. If you prompt “the man has an angry expression” you tend to get an intense expression of rage and all the face scrunching wrinkles that go with it. Or “the woman is crying” will get you an image of someone whose face is contorted by sorrow beyond all human comprehension. It might help a little to modify the prompt by prompting “the man is slightly angry”, but it can still be a bit much. \n\nAre there any prompt tricks/methods you use for more precise control of subtle emotions/expressions?

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nFor a little context, i finally took the full plunge into Ai and comfyui about 4 or 5 months ago as needed for a job. The overall goal was to define a unique 2d style, a sort of mix of retro anime and more modern western 2d art. After a ton of research, i ended up settling on using flux instead of SDXL, and went the lora training route, as opposed to something like ipadapters.\n\nI need (and have setup) a multi-part workflow, in that i can do:  \n1. pure text to image  \n2. text to image, but with a specific face. For the most part, ive been using bytedance's USO for this.  \n3. just applying the style to an existing image, with minimal changes otherwise. I've done this through controlnets, lower denoising values, and sometimes USO w no extra prompting, or a combination of the three.\n\nSo in general, it needs to be super flexible... It also needs to work for the looooong term, as it's for an ongoing use.\n\nThe way i have this setup is one project/workflow, with many different mini workflows in the same canvas, all using the same clip/vae/model through Anything Everywhere. (is this bad for any reason?)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/76eojquv3jeg1.png?width=2459&format=png&auto=webp&s=c331fcb4c43ceae8ae6a7ffcb2a34058ece3434a\n\nThe thing is, it feels like im CONSTANTLY fighting an uphill battle.  It takes me hours to get a decent looking image, that has no extra fingers, fits the lora style, doesnt have weird artifacting or banding, doesnt have poor edge quality for the 2d linework, etc.\n\n**So, as for my question(s):**  \n1. Is flux maybe not the right route for this? With the new flux 2 release, im seeing a real emphasis and lean towards realism as opposed to unique styles (in my case 2d.) Would SDXL maybe be better?  \n2. What prompted me to make this post was initially, just going to be asking **if an upgrade to flux 2, along with retraining of loras, might be worth it for my case.** But in researching, i saw so little content or info on style loras and/or 2d/anime stuff for flux 2, so i thought i might make a broader post.  \n  \nIn general, im still a huge noob to this whole world, given how deep it is. So would love tips on any aspect of my setup, goals, workflow, etc. Id even consider paying someone for a few hours of consultation on a call, if anyone has a good rep here on the sub or on fiver or something.\n\n\n\n*Here are some other odds and ends random questions, please feel free to ignore, but ill include in case someone is feeling kind or has a quick answer :)*\n\n1. Flux seems to just not know what some, seemingly, common concepts are. Is there any solution or tips for when these things arise? EXAMPLE: Recently i realized it has no concept of \"vapes,\" it didnt seem to know what a vape pen or box or anything like that was. I got ok-ish results from saying like \"small electronic device that's being held up his lips, with his cheeks pursed slightly as if inhaling.\" \n   1. It also seemed to handle smoke really poorly, but is that maybe more the fault of my stile lora perhaps? Actually, could that be the issue with vapes themselves too...?\n2. Would ipadapters maybe be a better route to try? right now im primarily using loras that i trained, as well as also sometimes mixing it with USO style images (in my setup, i have 3 copies of the USO workflow, one that has the lora + subject reference, one with lora + style reference, and one with lora + style + subject reference. all include text as well.) My lora was trained of a batch of images, and i sometimes include some of those back in to the style reference in an attempt to lock it in a bit more. Mixed results.\n3. Since my style has been to be hard to keep consistent, ive been including a sentence in front of every text prompt, and even including it as the only text in the prompt when i do generations that otherwise wouldn't require text. It seems to reinforce my style a bit, and i derived it from the language that was frequently used in the auto-generated captions that civitAi assigned my original style photos while training my lora. I did NOT end up using any caption on my images for the final lora that im using however, they were trained without keyword or captions. Is there any inherent issues with this? I got to this place through trial and error, and it seems to work better than without, but i'd still like to know if im breaking any basic rules here?\n   1. It's \"A vibrant digital illustration in retro anime style, with cel shading and clean bold lines for edges\".\n4. Is there a chance that my struggle with consistent style comes from poor lora training? I trained a ton of batched, slowly improving and honing in on what seemed best. But it may still not be great.\n\n  \nObviously, i realize that i may need to provide more info/details as needed if someone is kind enough to want to help, so please feel free to ask below.",
