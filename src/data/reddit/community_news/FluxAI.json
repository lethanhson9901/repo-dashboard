You say download the models for free here, linking to civitAI. But there is no FLux2 klein model to download on civit. But there is another link to your patreon where it can be downloaded for free after you join there. yeah.\n\nPlease, at least have the decency to announce that your lora is available on your patreon (maybe even free tier? I dont bother .... ). But don't announce it to be free for download when it isn't.",

There is no need to pay; I would never charge for these models. The point is to make them for users at no cost. Sorry if that was not clear. I'm just trying to direct traffic to Patreon to engage a more regular audience. No payment required :)",

      "text": "I’ve been messing around with changing art styles with  img2img in Flux.2 Klein, and I’ve noticed that while it can transfer a lot of image detail in stunning fidelity and quality, often facial features and expressions don’t transfer and must be prompted in. Positive expressions generally look good with a simple prompt, but negative expressions are often over-exaggerated. If you prompt “the man has an angry expression” you tend to get an intense expression of rage and all the face scrunching wrinkles that go with it. Or “the woman is crying” will get you an image of someone whose face is contorted by sorrow beyond all human comprehension. It might help a little to modify the prompt by prompting “the man is slightly angry”, but it can still be a bit much. \n\nAre there any prompt tricks/methods you use for more precise control of subtle emotions/expressions?
