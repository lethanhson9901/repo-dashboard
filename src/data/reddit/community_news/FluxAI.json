The goal was to push past emulation and generate an aesthetic that doesn't reference anything that already exists. The model is twice distilled and deliberately overfitted.\n\nThe first synthetic dataset was built from a multi-LoRA pipeline in ComfyUI, used to train the initial version. That model then fed a second image pipeline to generate the training data for the final version. Two generations of synthetic distillation to arrive at this look.\n\nThe animation was done with WAN2.2-I2V-A14B in ComfyUI using a chain of motion models to get the constant speed camera moves and particle systems. The final output was filmed on a CRT and composited with the original renders.\n\n**Recommended Settings:**\n\n* **Base Model:** Flux.1-dev\n* **Resolution:** 1138x640 (horizontal) or 640x1138 (vertical)\n* **Trigger Word:** \"Synthesia\"\n* **LoRA Strength:** 4.5\n* **Flux Guidance:** 1.2\n* **Max Shift:** 1.0\n* **Base Shift:** 8.0\n* **Sampler:** res\\_2m\n* **Scheduler:** beta\n* **Steps:** 35",

                  "text": "The challenge with stitching multiple start-and-end-frame shots together is that the motion between them rarely matches. I initially tried this with closed-source tools, but there were always noticeable shifts in camera motion between the separate shots. Using a couple of motion models — trained on drone footage and spinning cameras — helped smooth the transitions. For the first tests, I cranked all four motion model instances (high and low noise, 2x each) to high strengths, then locked the settings so the movement maintained consistent speed, energy, and direction across every shot. This made the cuts seamless. The full animation is built from a handful of 5-second clips stitched together",
