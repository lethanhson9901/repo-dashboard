      "text": "I wanted to change my haircut but didn't want to risk hating it, so I tried a bunch of AI tools to preview different styles. Most made me look like a cartoon or completely changed my face. Here are the three that actually worked:\n\n[FaceApp ](https://www.faceapp.com/)\\- Easiest option if you just want quick results on your phone. It keeps your face looking like you and has decent style options. The smoothing can be a bit much and hairline blending isn't perfect on buzz cuts, but it's fast and simple.\n\n**YouCam Makeup** \\- Best for experimenting with colors. Yeah it's a makeup app, but the hair tools are surprisingly good. You get way more control over shades and tones if you're thinking about going lighter. Bit more complicated to use though, and some features cost money.\n\n[RightHair ](https://righthair.ai/)\\- This one surprised me. It actually preserves your facial features way better than the others while swapping hairstyles. The results look more natural and less AI-generated. It's specifically built for hair visualization so it handles stuff like buzz cuts to medium length without warping your face. The only downside is it's not as well known so there's less community feedback on it.\n\nHonestly none of them are perfect, but they're good enough to give you confidence before sitting in that barber chair. FaceApp if you want something quick, YouCam if color matters, RightHair if you want the most realistic face preservation.\n\nHas anyone else found tools that work better? I'm still looking for something that nails photorealism.",

      "text": "Here’s a straightforward explanation of how Forge works on [Fiddl.art](http://Fiddl.art) for training custom Flux models. Forge allows you to create your own reusable model based on images you upload, so the system can learn a subject, style, object, or environment in a more consistent way.\n\nThe process starts by uploading images into Forge to create a training set.\n\nGood training sets typically include:\n\n* clear images\n* minimal filters\n* decent lighting\n* a consistent subject or theme\n\nThese images are what the model will learn from.\n\nOnce the dataset is ready, you set up a new custom model. First, you select your training set. Afterwards, you select the Flux base model:\n\n* Flux Dev — useful for faster testing and experimentation\n* Flux Pro — balanced realism and detail\n* Flux Pro Ultra — highest detail and fidelity\n\nNext, you select the Training Mode, which defines what kind of learning the model prioritizes:\n\n* Subject — best for portraits, characters, and living beings, focused on identity and likeness\n* Style — learns a specific artistic look or mood\n* Object — ideal for products and physical items where structure and detail matter\n* General — a flexible mode for environments, architecture, and mixed content\n\nThen you choose the Model Type:\n\n* Normal — a lighter training mode, generally suited for smaller datasets\n* Advanced — a deeper training mode that works best with larger, high-quality datasets\n\nAfter selecting the Base Model, Training Mode, and Model Type, you start the training process. Forge then trains a custom Flux model using your dataset and settings.\n\nOnce training is complete, you can generate images using your new model while maintaining consistency in identity, style, structure, or scene characteristics, depending on how you trained it. This is useful for things like:\n\n* consistent portraits or characters\n* product or brand imagery\n* repeating an art style\n* worldbuilding\n* storytelling projects\n\nInstead of depending on reference images every time, you work from a reusable trained model.\n\nMore info on this blog: [https://fiddl.art/blog/en/forge-tool-train-custom-ai-models](https://fiddl.art/blog/en/forge-tool-train-custom-ai-models)",
