The goal was to push past emulation and generate an aesthetic that doesn't reference anything that already exists. The model is twice distilled and deliberately overfitted.\n\nThe first synthetic dataset was built from a multi-LoRA pipeline in ComfyUI, used to train the initial version. That model then fed a second image pipeline to generate the training data for the final version. Two generations of synthetic distillation to arrive at this look.\n\nThe animation was done with WAN2.2-I2V-A14B in ComfyUI using a chain of motion models to get the constant speed camera moves and particle systems. The final output was filmed on a CRT and composited with the original renders.\n\n**Recommended Settings:**\n\n* **Base Model:** Flux.1-dev\n* **Resolution:** 1138x640 (horizontal) or 640x1138 (vertical)\n* **Trigger Word:** \"Synthesia\"\n* **LoRA Strength:** 4.5\n* **Flux Guidance:** 1.2\n* **Max Shift:** 1.0\n* **Base Shift:** 8.0\n* **Sampler:** res\\_2m\n* **Scheduler:** beta\n* **Steps:** 35",

                  "text": "The challenge with stitching multiple start-and-end-frame shots together is that the motion between them rarely matches. I initially tried this with closed-source tools, but there were always noticeable shifts in camera motion between the separate shots. Using a couple of motion models — trained on drone footage and spinning cameras — helped smooth the transitions. For the first tests, I cranked all four motion model instances (high and low noise, 2x each) to high strengths, then locked the settings so the movement maintained consistent speed, energy, and direction across every shot. This made the cuts seamless. The full animation is built from a handful of 5-second clips stitched together",

I have tested the most populer Samplers/Scheduler combinations with Klein9b (base)\n\nTest Environment:\n\nModel: Klein 9b Base (18gb) why base? cuz tested and saw that the only difference is the file size with the fp8 one. you can use same settings results will be the same. Keeping it just because it knows a little more than fp8 :)\n\nComfy setup: Normal Ksampler, 8 Steps, CFG:1.4 , Seed: 6145006317650\n\nLoras: Klein-Unchained 0.35 / Klein slider anatomy 1.50 / nipplediffusion 0.4 / Realism Engine 0.50 / klein snofs v1 0.30\n\nI use this Loras and weights cuz it is sweet spot for both nsfw and sfw with anatomy fix. why standart ksampler cuz we can combine schedulers other than flux2scheduler.\n\nPrompt: \"The woman’s blonde hair, a cascade of loose waves with subtle highlights catching the late afternoon sun, frames her face as she tilts her head slightly toward the camera; individual strands cling to her temple and collarbone, their texture soft yet defined by natural light. Her skin is fair with a warm undertone, kissed by sunlight that catches in the hollows beneath her eyes and along her cheekbones, while shadows pool subtly under her jawline. A single pearl stud earring glints faintly at her earlobe, its surface smooth and reflective despite the ambient glare. She wears a white ribbed crop top with a delicate keyhole cutout at the center of the bust; the fabric’s texture is coarse yet uniform, with vertical ridges visible under the light. Her denim jeans show signs of wear—frayed edges near the hem, faded stitching along the seams, and a small tear on the left thigh that reveals the raw, slightly frayed inner lining. The car interior features black leather seats with visible creases and scuff marks; the dashboard is glossy plastic reflecting ambient light, while the steering wheel’s grip shows signs of use with faint smudges and minor scratches. Outside the window, palm trees stand tall against a pale blue sky, their trunks textured with rough bark and fronds blurred by distance. A yellow warning sticker on the sunroof glows softly under direct sunlight, its edges sharply defined, while distant traffic lights cast muted red reflections onto the asphalt. The camera is positioned at eye level, capturing her from a slight low angle that emphasizes her smile and the curve of her shoulder; depth of field blurs the background into soft haze while keeping her face and upper body in crisp focus, creating an intimate yet candid atmosphere.\"\n\nI combined  \" DDIM-DDPM-EULER-EULER\\_A-RK\\_BETA-RES\\_2S\" with \"SIMPLE-NORMAL-BETA-BONG\\_TANGENT-BETA57\"\n\nDidnt combined the known ones \"heun-dpmpp\\_sde-res\\_multistep-er\\_sde-lcm-uni\\_pc-res6s\" because either the output was unusable or the gen times are not worth.\n\nI will share the image and a pureRef file for high res. ( you can install pureref it is a portable app which give you infinite canvas. you will like it if you are working with ai images. i promise)\n\n\\-WHAT TO LOOK FOR-\n\nHere is the main important part. I really loved Klein (more than zit :D) but it really lacks of Face realism and anatomy issues. I really love how the model is small in size, prompt adherence and body realism.\n\nSo give your critism based on these titles:\n\n\\*Face skin Realism\n\n\\*Body Skin Realism\n\n\\*Anatomy\n\n\\*Clothe Texture and that pokes :D ( you can fix it almost all sampler by reducing nsfw lora weights but main idea for it is to see how it handles that situation. standart klein gives old sdxl style cut out circle  naked  stuff. this lora combination can handle that smooth nsfw)\n\n\\*Face Texture (micro hairs, pores, imperfections, subscatter like veins under skin)\n\n\\*Body Texture (micro hairs, pores, imperfections, subscatter like veins under skin)\n\n\\*Inside envrionment (like big streering wheel, missing glass rim etc.)\n\n\\*outside environmen (like too many traffic lights, fused trees etc.)\n\nMaybe I will edit this post and add a poll too ( I am on pc right now and poll doesnt work here)\n\nLink for the image file (compressed jpeg)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wzlaxaq88xjg1.jpg?width=8240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64351882ea955ce758f972208b67dfa957726638\n\nLink for PureRef file.\n\n[Pure Ref - Klein9b realism.pur](https://filebin.net/7ly4da2i32qsi2ck/klein9b%20realism.pur) (76mb)\n\nLink for the Uncompressed PNG (76mb)\n\n[Uncompressed PNG](https://filebin.net/uip8xqnhwwhri1eu/Untitled.png)",

          "text": "I asked about klein to my chatbot and this was the answer: It’s a common misconception because of how older models worked, but here is the breakdown of why **Euler** is actually the king for FLUX.2.\n\n# 1. FLUX Uses \"Flow Matching\"\n\nUnlike the traditional Stable Diffusion models (SD 1.5 or SDXL) that rely on a \"Diffusion\" process, FLUX uses a mathematically different framework called **Flow Matching**. In traditional diffusion, the AI tries to \"denoise\" an image step-by-step, which often requires complex, high-order samplers to find the right path. Flow Matching, however, creates a **straight-line path** from random noise to the final image. Because the path is a straight line, the simplest sampler—Euler—is the most mathematically accurate tool to follow it.\n\n# 2. Why Euler Equals High Quality in FLUX\n\nThe developers at Black Forest Labs specifically optimized and tuned FLUX.2 and FLUX.2 \\[klein\\] to work with the **Euler** sampler. While Euler used to be considered \"fast but low quality\" in older models, in the FLUX architecture, it provides the cleanest results without the \"over-sharpening\" or \"pixel deep-frying\" artifacts that often occur when using more complex samplers like DPM++ on this specific model.\n\n# 3. Sampler Performance and Characteristics\n\nWhen using FLUX, **Euler** is considered the gold standard because it delivers the most stable and faithful interpretation of your prompt with the cleanest textures. If you try to use **DPM++** or other multi-step samplers, you might actually see a decrease in quality, such as unnatural skin textures or weird visual artifacts, because those samplers are trying to \"correct\" a path that is already straight. Other options like **Beta** or **Simple** schedulers paired with Euler can offer a slightly softer, more photographic look, but Euler remains the most reliable choice for overall sharpness and anatomical correctness.",

              "text": "When I deeply looked at the images saw that ddim and Euler created exact same images with exact same errors. As you mention other sampler scheduler combinations diverting the straight line so it gives little more variation. With models like Klein (turbo like low step) the image is already there at the first 2-3 steps so using other sampler and scheduler sometimes it gives un intended details but may look more realistic. Plus the most important discovery I get here ddpm have richer color ( which normally Klein reduces) can be used to restore color of the edited images",

Low denoise with ddpm will restore your color loss( Klein loses color in every edit)",
