The goal was to push past emulation and generate an aesthetic that doesn't reference anything that already exists. The model is twice distilled and deliberately overfitted.\n\nThe first synthetic dataset was built from a multi-LoRA pipeline in ComfyUI, used to train the initial version. That model then fed a second image pipeline to generate the training data for the final version. Two generations of synthetic distillation to arrive at this look.\n\nThe animation was done with WAN2.2-I2V-A14B in ComfyUI using a chain of motion models to get the constant speed camera moves and particle systems. The final output was filmed on a CRT and composited with the original renders.\n\n**Recommended Settings:**\n\n* **Base Model:** Flux.1-dev\n* **Resolution:** 1138x640 (horizontal) or 640x1138 (vertical)\n* **Trigger Word:** \"Synthesia\"\n* **LoRA Strength:** 4.5\n* **Flux Guidance:** 1.2\n* **Max Shift:** 1.0\n* **Base Shift:** 8.0\n* **Sampler:** res\\_2m\n* **Scheduler:** beta\n* **Steps:** 35",

On Runpod I replaced the distilled int8 model with the [distilled nvfp4 model](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-9b-nvfp4), replaced the load int8 node with a regular load diffusion model node, and removed torchcompilemodel. Int8 models: [https://huggingface.co/aydin99/FLUX.2-klein-4B-int8](https://huggingface.co/aydin99/FLUX.2-klein-4B-int8).\n\nI've been wondering if I should upgrade from a 3090 to a 50 card. On the 3090 I use Klein 9B int8, and on a 5090 Runpod instance: Klein 9B nvfp4. Same comfyui workflow, using the in-paint crop and stitch node on 1536 x 3424 images for in-painting. Overall it was on average 2x faster, \\~20 secs on the 5090 and 30-40 on the 3090, little quality difference.\n\nI don't feel like its worth upgrading. These were quick and dirty tests, but tell me your thoughts.",
