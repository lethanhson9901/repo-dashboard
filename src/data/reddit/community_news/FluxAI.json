You might train a lora on this part.\n\nImo Klein is accurate enough to make these experiments worth while.",

Considering that Klein is already a distilled model, does \"distilling it twice\" by making a quant of it cause enough degradation that I'd be better off just using a different base model? Would the Dev Q4 be too much for my system to handle practically? Am I better off just going with a 4B model for speed generation and then i2i with a higher model for quality later?",

In Klein's case, this makes it capable of inferring in 4 steps (non-distilled needs 50 steps), but the size remains the same.",
