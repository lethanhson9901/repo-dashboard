I need it to report the problems with the decoded JPEG and their offsets. The latter part is crucial. Knowing where the data is corrupted I can find it in the PDF file and fix the OCR mistakes. Currently I see all the libraries report errors like `Error in decoding MCU. Reason Marker UNKNOWN(67) found in bitstream, possibly corrupt jpeg`. I mean, cool, the byte 67 is wrong. I can fix it. Can you tell me which one? And is it even a 0x67 or not?\n\nAlso, if anyone wants to train a classifier model for better OCR, you'd need those cleaned up files for training.

A lot of people expose n8n directly or behind a simple reverse proxy without any additional auth layer on the webhook paths, assuming the workflow-level authentication is sufficient. Getting RCE through JavaScript destructuring abuse in the expression evaluator is a nasty primitive because n8n's whole value proposition is running arbitrary integrations — meaning the blast radius post-exploitation is enormous (API keys, database credentials, cloud tokens for every connected service).\n\n  \nThis is also a good reminder that sandboxing JavaScript execution in Node.js is fundamentally hard. n8n uses vm2 (or did, before it was abandoned) and later moved to isolated-vm, but expression evaluation paths sometimes bypass the sandbox entirely. The Code node vs expression evaluation have different trust boundaries that aren't always obvious.\n\n  \nFor anyone running n8n in production: put it behind a VPN or zero-trust proxy (Cloudflare Access, Tailscale, etc.), never expose webhook endpoints to the raw internet without rate limiting and input validation at the edge, and treat the n8n process as fully privileged in your threat model.",

All of this is free - I'm really proud of what we made.  We are building a larger scale Cyber Security company doing other things but this is a free thing we put out into the world for people to use. Most scripts currently are for hardening machines, patching vulnerabilities, etc currently but its an open platform for all types of scripts.  Feel free to suggest features.",

Repo: [https://github.com/wallarm/gotestwaf](https://github.com/wallarm/gotestwaf)\n\nIf you're running any kind of WAF or API security layer, this might be worth a look.\n\n**What it does:** Simulates a broad spectrum of attacks - SQLi, XSS, RCE, path traversal, XXE, SSRF, LDAP/NoSQL injection, mail injection, GraphQL/gRPC/SOAP abuse, and more. Tests both true positives (does it catch attacks) and false positives (does it block legitimate traffic).\n\n**Why it stands out:** The combination approach: payloads × encoders × placeholders. If you have 2 payloads, 3 encoders (base64, URL, JSUnicode), and 4 HTTP positions, that's 24 unique test requests automatically generated. Most tools test payloads in isolation. This catches evasion patterns that slip through single-layer detection.\n\n**API protocols covered:** REST, GraphQL, gRPC, SOAP, XMLRPC - plus raw HTTP for custom requests.\n\n**Output:** YAML-based test cases you can customize. Reports in HTML, PDF, and CSV. Used for vendor comparisons, internal rule tuning, and CI/CD regression testing.",

Looking for feedback on the crypto design before I ship it.\n\n### Threat model (abbreviated)\n\n- Primary adversary: Someone with physical device access and forensic tools (Cellebrite, GrayKey)\n- Device passcode is assumed compromised\n- App must protect data with app-level encryption\n- Acceptable trade-off: Data destruction is preferable to data exposure\n\n### Crypto design\n\n**Key derivation:**\n- Argon2id\n- 64MB memory\n- 3 iterations\n- 4 parallelism\n- 32-byte output\n- Per-device salt (32 bytes, stored in Keychain/Keystore)\n\n**Storage encryption:**\n- SQLCipher (AES-256-CBC with HMAC-SHA512)\n- Derived key passed directly to SQLCipher\n- Key never written to disk\n\n**Brute-force protection:**\n- Attempt counter stored in Keychain/Keystore (separate from encrypted DB)\n- After N failed attempts (configurable, default 7): overwrite DB with random bytes, delete DB file, clear Keychain/Keystore\n- No recovery possible\n\n**Duress mode:**\n- Optional secondary PIN\n- When entered, shows empty functional app with in-memory-only state\n- Real data remains encrypted, inaccessible\n- Indistinguishable from fresh install to observer\n\n### Questions\n\n1. **Argon2id parameters:** 64MB / 3 iterations — is this sufficient given mobile device constraints and the threat model? Should I increase memory at the cost of UX on low-end devices?\n\n2. **Salt storage:** Storing the salt in Keychain/Keystore means a device backup could include the salt. Is this a meaningful weakness, or is the derived key still protected by the PIN entropy?\n\n3. **Self-destruct reliability:** Overwriting with random bytes before deletion. On flash storage with wear leveling, is this actually effective? Should I do multiple overwrite passes?\n\n4. **Attack I'm missing:** What would you try if you had the device and wanted to extract the data?\n\nFull threat model and design docs: https://github.com/tarn-app/tarn\n\nThanks in advance.",
