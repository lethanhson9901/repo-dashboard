The reason I didn't contact Äike and instead emailed the IoT module company was partly because Äike had taken down their customer support page (in the app, at least - it redirected back to the main site), and since I knew that the IoT company and Äike worked closely together (even sharing the management to some degree) and since they're still in business, it was a surefire way to ensure that the disclosure reached the correct people. I didn't share this context in the post, but both Äike and the rental service Tuul were actually spun off from the IoT module company, as they wanted to show the market that their IoT products and modules can be used to build successful products.",
