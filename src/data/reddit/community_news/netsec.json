Unfortunately my finding is that agents are not good with CLI's that are not common knowledge.  A CLI that they intrinsically understand they use well, but a CLI which they must learn how to use is different, and in that case MCP does perform better.\n\nMany agents would use help to discover usage at the start, but then would stop and instead try to assume usage. Often resulting in trial and error that used more tokens than MCP would use just putting usage up front.\n\nAfter a fair bit of testing, I did find that the MCP overall was more reliable and did use less tokens (the savings of tokens in usage and tool descriptions did not make up for less reliable tool usage).  Now I focus the CLI on human usage and the MCP on agent usage.\n\nMCP does have an API for dynamic tool loading, which may be the ultimate answer, but support is still too new to comment on right now.\n\nLet me know if you have other experiences, or any advice I should try out in my project. I am going to continue to explore this space for a while.",

The Secure AI Integration and API Security patterns are particularly relevant given the rapid adoption of AI APIs in production environments.\n\nWe've been seeing a significant increase in model extraction attacks and API abuse targeting AI infrastructure. The delegation chain exploitation pattern you mentioned is especially critical - many organizations don't realize that their AI service providers can be compromised through indirect API calls.\n\nFrom our experience implementing AI API security solutions, the OWASP API Top 10 mappings to NIST controls are spot-on. We've found that:\n\n1. Broken Object Level Authorization (A01:2021) is the most common vulnerability in AI APIs - many systems don't properly validate that users can only access their own model outputs and training data.\n\n2. Security Misconfiguration (A05:2021) is rampant in AI deployments - default API keys, overly permissive CORS policies, and lack of rate limiting are common issues.\n\n3. Server-Side Request Forgery (A10:2021) becomes particularly dangerous with AI APIs since they often make downstream calls to multiple services.\n\nThe shadow AI problem you mentioned is also growing - employees using unauthorized AI services that bypass corporate security controls entirely.\n\nYour NIST 800-53 mappings provide a great foundation for organizations to build comprehensive AI security programs. The free self-assessment tool is particularly valuable for teams starting their AI security journey.\n\nHave you considered adding patterns specifically for:\n- Model extraction detection and prevention\n- AI API usage monitoring and anomaly detection\n- Data privacy compliance in AI systems (GDPR Article 22, etc.)\n\nThis work fills a critical gap in the security community.

Be default Kingfisher runs with \\`--confidence medium\\` which excludes low confidence rules.\n* **Skip known false positives**: Use `--skip-regex` and/or `--skip-word` to suppress known benign patterns, including inline ignores in code; both match against the secret value and surrounding context so you can be precise.\n* **Inline ignore directives**: Add `kingfisher:ignore` anywhere on the same line as a finding to silence it. (see https://github.com/mongodb/kingfisher/blob/main/docs/ADVANCED.md#inline-ignore-directives)\n* **Baseline management**: Create a baseline of existing findings so future scans only report *new* issues; great for large repos with legacy noise.

I'm considering adding a `migration_complexity` field to the JSON output so teams can prioritize by effort, not just risk.\n\nNew algorithms on platforms like GitHub auth — agreed, detection for newer PQC-compatible algorithms is on the roadmap. Right now it catches what's vulnerable, but flagging what's *already migrated* would be just as useful.\n\nGPG — yes, most GPG keys in the wild are RSA or classical ECC, both quantum-vulnerable. Adding GPG keyring scanning is a solid idea. I'll open an issue for it.\n\nThanks — this is exactly the kind of feedback that makes the tool better.",
