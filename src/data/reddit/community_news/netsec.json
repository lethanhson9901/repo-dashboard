If TWC is using these fingerprints for cross-session tracking or selling behavioral profiles downstream, an attacker can poison that entire dataset at scale. An unauthenticated, unrate-limited API endpoint serving location resolution for 50M+ US devices is a security problem.",

This is a textbook OWASP MASVS violation across multiple categories - the hardcoded API keys alone are a storage issue (MSTG-STORAGE-1), but the real problem is the confluence of weak entropy in the fingerprint generation and lack of request signing. I'd be curious if you pulled the APK and ran it through jadx to check whether the placeids are generated client-side or just consumed from the API response - that distinction matters for whether this is an API design flaw or an app-level tracking vector Samsung introduced intentionally. The coordinate redundancy you mention is especially damning; that's not defensive programming, that's just logging location data twice. For anyone replicating this, frida hooks on the HTTP client would let you intercept and log the full request/response cycle in real-time without needing to parse network traffic. Did you check whether the placeid scheme is deterministic per location, or does it vary across devices querying the same place? If it's deterministic, that's a separate information disclosure issue - attackers could precompute a placeid database and correlate users.",

              "text": "Fair point, and it’s a legitimate concern for security tooling. Let me be transparent about it.\nYes, agentic coding was part of the workflow. But the git history also shows the test suite: 80% unit test coverage, integration tests that spin up a real container, run a malware behavior simulator, and assert that every expected event type was actually captured. Linter and security scan on every PR. All in CI, you can check it yourself.\nThe eBPF programs and the cgroup filtering logic were the parts I reviewed most carefully line by line, because that’s where a subtle bug would actually matter from a security perspective. That’s not something you can ship on vibes and hope for the best.\nThe idea that agentic coding and actually understanding your codebase are mutually exclusive is worth pushing back on. The question is whether the author can reason about what the code does and why. Happy to go deep on any specific part if you want to probe that.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

If I can push a hash of my choosing, I can just push a hash that I know the password so this isn't about account takeover. And it has to be an account I can change the password for, so there's no permission bypass here.\n\nYou can, indeed, voluntarily weaken your own password through an unorthodox procedure. That has no bearing on most users and doesn't make existing hashes that follow policy easier to crack. That's also not discreet as the user who's password you change will notice that their password has changed (and probably change it in return).\n\nMaybe there's a scenario where you use malware to change someone's password to something easier to crack, but again why change it to something you have to crack at all?\n\nSorry, but I really don't see the problem. If the only way to escape policy is through a non-standard procedure that requires proper authorization, then there's no security theater at play. You can voluntarily downgrade your own password. It would probably be better if it wasn't the case, but it doesn't invalidate the impact of the policy at scale, and if your goal is to facilitate someone breaking into your account, just give them the password. It'll leave less traces than changing your own password to something easier to crack.",

Any AI agent that has write access to a repository, publish permissions, or the ability to trigger workflows is now a viable lateral movement path if it can be influenced through untrusted input channels.\n\n\n\nThe issue triager case is particularly interesting because the trust model for an issue tracker is fundamentally inverted from what you want in a privileged pipeline component. Issues are designed to be submitted by anyone, including external reporters who are not vetted contributors. Wiring a model with deployment permissions to that input channel without strict output constraints and intent verification is a significant architectural mistake.\n\n\n\nThe broader pattern is that many teams are integrating agents into workflows where they inherit permissions far beyond what their actual tasks require. An agent that labels and triages issues needs read access and label write access. It does not need release artifact permissions or the ability to approve PRs. The principle of least privilege applies to AI agents at least as much as it does to service accounts, but the tooling to scope agent permissions precisely is still immature.\n\n\n\nThe GHSA advisory albinowax linked about the self-propagation angle makes this worse. Once the agent can be turned against the repository it's supposed to protect, you're looking at a persistence mechanism that survives rotations and reviews that would catch traditional backdoors.",

Since this bridges web and mobile, worth noting that similar session hijacking patterns show up in mobile apps when developers hardcode credentials or store sensitive tokens in plaintext SharedPreferences/Keychain. The OWASP MASTG covers this under insecure storage, but the social engineering angle here is the real weapon. I'd be curious if you pulled the extension's permissions manifest — Chrome extensions with webRequest or declarativeNetRequest can passively intercept and exfiltrate cookies before the replay even happens. If you're building detection tooling, correlating extension install timestamps with sudden App Store Connect login anomalies from unfamiliar geolocations (even through proxies) might catch earlier iterations. Have you considered flagging extensions that request broad host permissions combined with credential-handling APIs?",
