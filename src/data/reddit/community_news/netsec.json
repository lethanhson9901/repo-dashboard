Unfortunately my finding is that agents are not good with CLI's that are not common knowledge.  A CLI that they intrinsically understand they use well, but a CLI which they must learn how to use is different, and in that case MCP does perform better.\n\nMany agents would use help to discover usage at the start, but then would stop and instead try to assume usage. Often resulting in trial and error that used more tokens than MCP would use just putting usage up front.\n\nAfter a fair bit of testing, I did find that the MCP overall was more reliable and did use less tokens (the savings of tokens in usage and tool descriptions did not make up for less reliable tool usage).  Now I focus the CLI on human usage and the MCP on agent usage.\n\nMCP does have an API for dynamic tool loading, which may be the ultimate answer, but support is still too new to comment on right now.\n\nLet me know if you have other experiences, or any advice I should try out in my project. I am going to continue to explore this space for a while.",

It can relay both TCP and UDP to arbitrary peer addresses, so if not properly restricted, you've got an open proxy that can reach internal networks, localhost, cloud metadata services, etc.\n\nSome highlights:\n\n- During pentests we regularly find TURN servers that can reach internal networks, localhost, cloud metadata (169.254.169.254). If peer addresses aren't restricted, it's game over.\n- At DEF CON 2025, Adam Crosser demoed C2 operations running through Zoom and Teams TURN servers. Security monitoring sees legitimate video call traffic.\n- coturn (most common TURN implementation) has had 30+ memory safety fixes, a CVSS 9.8 SQL injection, and we found an IPv6 loopback bypass where the protection code just didn't work (CVE-2020-26262).\n- TURN servers are also abused for DDoS reflection/amplification. Only ~4x factor but they're everywhere and often misconfigured.\n\nPost goes into the technical details of each relay method (Send Indication, ChannelData, TCP Connect), real attack scenarios, and what defense actually looks like.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

We do this atomically rather than checking existence separately, which would create a window where an attacker could swap the symlink between our check and resolution.\n\nOn macOS, the sandbox enforces against literal path strings rather than resolved paths. So we store both the original path and the resolved real path, then emit sandbox rules for both. Without this, granting access via the real path would still block programs trying to use the symlink.\n\nWe also use proper path component comparison rather than string comparison when checking path relationships.  String prefix matching would incorrectly match paths that just happen to share the same starting characters but aren't actually descendants of the directory in question.\n\nWe also handle parent directory traversal. To access a deeply nested path, programs need to stat each parent directory along the way. We automatically allow metadata-only access to parent directories of granted paths, walking both the original and resolved path hierarchies when they differ.\n\nTaking a look at the blog thanks!   ",

              "text": "Containers and nono solve overlapping but distinct problems, and each has real trade-offs worth considering. There is a section in the docs on this: https://docs.nono.sh/security/containers \n\nContainers give you isolation through namespacing - the process sees a different filesystem root, network stack, and process tree. This is powerful for reproducibility and portability. You can ship a known-good environment, and anything the AI does stays inside that container's view of the world. The downside is that containers are coarse-grained. You either mount a volume into the container or you don't. There's no easy way to say \"read the whole project but only write to the src directory\" or \"access ~/.vscode , but not ~/.ssh/.\" You end up either over-permissioning (mounting your whole home directory) or dealing with friction every time the AI needs something outside the container.\n\nnono takes the opposite approach - it runs natively on your host but uses OS-level mandatory access control (Landlock on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS) to enforce fine-grained capabilities. You can grant read access to your entire codebase while restricting writes to specific directories, block access to credentials and browser data regardless of what commands run, and allow network access while still protecting sensitive local paths. The sandbox is applied to the process itself, not to a virtualized environment, so there's no filesystem copying, no Docker daemon, and near-zero startup overhead. \n\nWhere nono is stronger: granularity. You can express policies like \"read everywhere, write only here, never touch my SSH keys\" that would be awkward or impossible with container volume mounts. It also integrates more naturally with local tooling - your shell, your editor, your existing workflows all just work. \n\nWhere containers are stronger: they provide a complete environment boundary. If the AI installs a malicious package or corrupts system files, it's contained to that throwaway environment. With nono, you're still running on your real system - the sandbox prevents unauthorized access, but if you grant write access to a directory, the AI can still make a mess there (having said that we have an atomic undo system incoming).\n\nThe honest answer is they're complimentary. You can run nono inside a container for defense in depth, or use nono alone when you want lightweight, precise control without the overhead of containerization. It depends on which you value portability and environment isolation (containers) or fine-grained capability control with minimal friction (nono). \n\nThe other factor is nono has a load of other features thrown in, key protection, blocking of dangerous commands, and quite a bit more inbound. \n\nBut honestly, if containers are working, great! I am a fan and its never x vs y here, each have their own strengths.",
