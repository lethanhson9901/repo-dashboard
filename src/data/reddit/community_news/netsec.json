The other 95% is identity management.\n\nWe use PGP only because it is a interoperability standard that addresses a difficult problem.

Great for defenders and bug bounty hunters.\n\nKingfisher also ships a local findings/access-map web viewer (\\`--view-report\\`) so you can quickly filter down to validated/active creds without exporting into another platform.",

What surprised me most wasn’t the volume, but how fragmented and inconsistent the signal is across sources.\n\nSame incident reported differently, timelines unclear, impact overstated or understated depending on the outlet. Turning this into something usable for non-technical leadership required heavy normalization and filtering.\n\nThe end result is a daily briefing that strips incidents down to what’s confirmed, what’s unknown, and why it matters.\n\nWould be interested to hear how others here handle breach intelligence curation and validation.",
