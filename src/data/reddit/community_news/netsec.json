We also incorporated AI to make it possible to generate scripts right there. If there's a bug in the script it can read what is already in the window and make adjustments. All of this is free - I'm really proud of what we made.  We are building a larger scale Cyber Security company doing other things but this is a free thing we put out into the world for people to use. Most scripts currently are for hardening machines, patching vulnerabilities, etc currently but its an open platform for all types of scripts.  Feel free to suggest features.",
