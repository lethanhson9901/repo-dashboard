              "text": "That’s fair criticism, and I mostly agree with the scope you’re describing — this is not meant to replace enterprise password managers or self-hosted tools like PrivateBin.\n\nMy goal with ShareMyLogin is much narrower and more pragmatic:\n\nI’m building credibility for my business by shipping free, usable tools that solve a real, common problem — safe one-off credential sharing — in a way that’s meaningfully better than email, Slack, or screenshots, which is how this is still done in practice.\n\nYes, alternatives exist. They always do.\nPastebin existed before OneTimeSecret.\nChatGPT existed before Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, Qwen — some open source, some enterprise, some neither.\n\nNew tools still get built because:\n- They make different tradeoffs\n- They optimize for different users\n- They lower friction in a specific workflow\n\nShareMyLogin is intentionally:\n- Zero-knowledge at the crypto layer (client-side encryption, server never sees plaintext)\n- No account, no setup, no onboarding\n- Opinionated toward credential sharing, not generic pastes\n- Hosted and easy — because most people will never self-host\n\nOn trust: you’re right that any hosted service requires operator trust. That’s unavoidable unless you self-host. What I can do (and do intentionally) is:\n- Publish the cryptographic core so encryption behavior is verifiable\n- Avoid over-claiming (no “trustless”, no “enterprise-grade” language)\n- Be explicit about what the service is and is not designed for\n\nFor organizations with mature security needs, password managers or self-hosted tools are the right answer.\nFor individuals, freelancers, agencies, and small teams who just need to hand off hosting credentials safely once, this improves the status quo.\n\nI’m not trying to win the “perfect security” argument — I’m trying to make a common workflow less risky, while demonstrating how I think about security in real products.\n\nThat’s the value here.",

                  "text": "The problem of \"safe one-off credential sharing\" is not due to the lack of existing tooling, which has already been solved, it is teaching people to use them. Building a new tool doesn't help this problem, so the premise of your product is wrong.\n\nYou say that your product is \"opinionated toward credential sharing, not generic pastes\". But whoever can do more can do less, so if you can share securely pastes, then you can securely share credentials using the same tool, no point having a tool dedicated to it.\n\nYou say that \"most people will never self-host\". That may be essentially true for private individuals, but that's false for companies, especially ones that do care about security.\n\nThe other two points of what you say your product intentionally is are already existing in other solutions we talked about.\n\nAll in all, I don't see any value, except for people that are not serious about security and as such, are not willing to self-host. But I'm not sure who would want to deal with these, company-wise I mean. Of course, individuals won't self host, and can therefore use Signal/WhatsApp/whatever safely.\n\nEverything else being said, I can understand the goal of building credibility for your business. If you think this tool can help you achieve that goal, good for you. Then the true \"problem\" that is tried to being solved here is the lack of credibility for your business, not the \"safe one-off credential sharing\". \n\nIf I may offer suggestions for that goal, I suggest to be upfront about who you are and what your business is. I eventually found on your Github profile that you *say* you are from Canada, but I cannot see any other verifiable piece of information about you or your business: names, pictures, phones, adresses, some kind of Business Registration Number that one can verify in a public directory. I don't see any company, apart from malicious/fraudulent/illegal ones, that would want to do business with a company that seems to be hiding.",

I hope some of this helps.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n\\- Uses AES-256-GCM (industry standard authenticated encryption)\n\n\\- PBKDF2 with 250K iterations for key derivation\n\n\\- Random 16-byte salt and 12-byte IV per encryption\n\n\\- Uses Web Crypto API (hardware-accelerated, constant-time)\n\n\\- Auth tag validated on decryption (prevents tampering)\n\n\\- Database stores only ciphertext, no plaintext\n\n\\- Destroy token stored as hash\n\n\n\nTHE CONCERNS\n\n1. Offline brute-force risk - Once someone retrieves your ciphertext, rate limiting doesn't help. A modern GPU can try \\~5-10K passwords/sec against 250K PBKDF2. Weak passwords get cracked fast.\n\n2. No password strength enforcement - The code accepts any password. \"password123\" completely undermines the crypto.\n\n3. Secret ID enumeration - The /api/view/:id endpoint reveals if a secret exists. If IDs are predictable, attackers can discover valid ones.\n\n4. URL fragment leakage - If passwords are in URL fragments, they end up in browser history, potentially leak via Referer headers, and are visible to extensions.\n\n5. Trust model gaps - You have to trust:\n\n  \\- The JS they serve matches this repo (no way to verify without diffing yourself)\n\n  \\- They won't serve modified code to targeted users\n\n  \\- Their backend doesn't log anything beyond what's documented\n\n  \\- Data is actually deleted and not backed up somewhere\n\n6. PBKDF2 iterations - 250K is adequate but OWASP now recommends 600K+ for SHA-256.\n\nVERDICT\n\nThe crypto implementation is solid. No obvious bugs in the encrypt/decrypt logic. The real risks are:\n\n\\- Weak passwords (use 16+ random characters)\n\n\\- Trusting the service operator\n\n\\- Offline attacks after ciphertext retrieval\n\nI'd rate it B+ - good browser crypto with standard limitations. Your security depends entirely on password strength and how much you trust the operator.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS IF YOU USE IT\n\n\\- Use a strong random password (16+ chars)\n\n\\- Share the password through a separate channel, not the link\n\n\\- Use one-time mode when possible\n\n\\- Don't store anything truly critical",

Although keeping parts of code open on Github is to assure how things work and kept, but it's a long game. \n6. Not a huge factor but optional improvement. \n\nAnd by default nothing stays in system after 30 days, so people don't take it as a password manager. \n\nHappy to reply with more elaborated answers if these don't help or clear doubts.",
