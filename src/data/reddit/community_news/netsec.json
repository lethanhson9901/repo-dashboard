Then grab some characters from the document and compare against the compressed corpus. That should get you in the ballpark for identification. After that, it’s a pixel comparison contest where each potential character is compared against the ballpark set. If something is too close to call or doesn’t match at all, then flag for manual review.",

I need it to report the problems with the decoded JPEG and their offsets. The latter part is crucial. Knowing where the data is corrupted I can find it in the PDF file and fix the OCR mistakes. Currently I see all the libraries report errors like `Error in decoding MCU. Reason Marker UNKNOWN(67) found in bitstream, possibly corrupt jpeg`. I mean, cool, the byte 67 is wrong. I can fix it. Can you tell me which one? And is it even a 0x67 or not?\n\nAlso, if anyone wants to train a classifier model for better OCR, you'd need those cleaned up files for training.

I think they're digital all the way, equivalent to screenshots of rendered text. (My guess would be that they used the Print to PDF feature in whatever email software they are using, applied redactions to the output, and then rasterised the result because they don't know how else to stop fucking up the redaction process.)\n\n**I believe this opens up new possibilities for accurate OCR.**\n\nI say they're not scans because:\n\n1. I couldn't find any dust (e.g. random grey pixels between lines of text)\n2. Lines of text are perfectly horizontal\n3. If you zoom in, the antialiasing looks like it's in its original condition\n\nHaving extracted the images, without compression or resizing artefacts, I observe the following:\n\nUnfortunately, it is *not* the case that the same character always renders to the exact same pixels. This is because a single column of monospaced characters has a non-integer width (it's about 7.8px).\n\nHowever, rows appear to have a height of *exactly* 15px. If we're lucky, this means that, when the same character occurs *in the same column*, it reliably produces the same pixels.\n\nNow, I admit that I've only tested with a very small number of examples, manually, using the colour picker in GIMP. But the above does appear to be true! Hopefully, this means that we're working with a finite number of pixmap representations of each character.\n\nIn fact, I think the width is *exactly* 7.8px, giving us only five possible variants of each character. This is subject to the same caveat about very light testing, but for example, the first and last characters in `there if it` are rendered totally identically. The same holds true for the 2^nd and 16^th `I`s in that long run of `ICAg` at the end.\n\nSo, I believe it is possible to do a sort of dumb \"OCR\" on this by splitting it up in to regular (well, predictably irregular) tiles, and checking a library of reference tiles for an exact match for each tile. We would only need 64×5=320 reference tiles. It seems relatively likely that there's existing software that takes this approach, but I haven't looked for it yet.",

Instead, an image is a *stream object*, i.e. a sequence of binary bytes, which must be interpreted according to the dimensions and pixel format specified in a *dictionary* which occurs just before the stream. For compression, the dictionary may also specify *filters*, which are applied before said interpretation.\n\nPDF supports a filter called DCTDecode, which is very similar to JPEG, but it isn't used in EFTA00400459.pdf.\n\nAll image streams in EFTA00400459.pdf have a dictionary a bit like this:\n\n    <</Type /XObject /Subtype /Image /Name /Im0 /Filter [/FlateDecode ] /Width 816 /Height 1056 /ColorSpace 10 0 R /BitsPerComponent 8 /Length 9 0 R >> \n\n\n`/Filter [/FlateDecode ]` means the stream should be decompressed using the DEFLATE algorithm.

          "text": "The public webhook attack surface is the part that should concern anyone self-hosting n8n. A lot of people expose n8n directly or behind a simple reverse proxy without any additional auth layer on the webhook paths, assuming the workflow-level authentication is sufficient. Getting RCE through JavaScript destructuring abuse in the expression evaluator is a nasty primitive because n8n's whole value proposition is running arbitrary integrations — meaning the blast radius post-exploitation is enormous (API keys, database credentials, cloud tokens for every connected service).\n\n  \nThis is also a good reminder that sandboxing JavaScript execution in Node.js is fundamentally hard. n8n uses vm2 (or did, before it was abandoned) and later moved to isolated-vm, but expression evaluation paths sometimes bypass the sandbox entirely. The Code node vs expression evaluation have different trust boundaries that aren't always obvious.\n\n  \nFor anyone running n8n in production: put it behind a VPN or zero-trust proxy (Cloudflare Access, Tailscale, etc.), never expose webhook endpoints to the raw internet without rate limiting and input validation at the edge, and treat the n8n process as fully privileged in your threat model.",
