Unfortunately my finding is that agents are not good with CLI's that are not common knowledge.  A CLI that they intrinsically understand they use well, but a CLI which they must learn how to use is different, and in that case MCP does perform better.\n\nMany agents would use help to discover usage at the start, but then would stop and instead try to assume usage. Often resulting in trial and error that used more tokens than MCP would use just putting usage up front.\n\nAfter a fair bit of testing, I did find that the MCP overall was more reliable and did use less tokens (the savings of tokens in usage and tool descriptions did not make up for less reliable tool usage).  Now I focus the CLI on human usage and the MCP on agent usage.\n\nMCP does have an API for dynamic tool loading, which may be the ultimate answer, but support is still too new to comment on right now.\n\nLet me know if you have other experiences, or any advice I should try out in my project. I am going to continue to explore this space for a while.",

Server-Side Request Forgery (A10:2021) becomes particularly dangerous with AI APIs since they often make downstream calls to multiple services.\n\nThe shadow AI problem you mentioned is also growing - employees using unauthorized AI services that bypass corporate security controls entirely.\n\nYour NIST 800-53 mappings provide a great foundation for organizations to build comprehensive AI security programs. The free self-assessment tool is particularly valuable for teams starting their AI security journey.\n\nHave you considered adding patterns specifically for:\n- Model extraction detection and prevention\n- AI API usage monitoring and anomaly detection\n- Data privacy compliance in AI systems (GDPR Article 22, etc.)\n\nThis work fills a critical gap in the security community.

It can relay both TCP and UDP to arbitrary peer addresses, so if not properly restricted, you've got an open proxy that can reach internal networks, localhost, cloud metadata services, etc.\n\nSome highlights:\n\n- During pentests we regularly find TURN servers that can reach internal networks, localhost, cloud metadata (169.254.169.254). If peer addresses aren't restricted, it's game over.\n- At DEF CON 2025, Adam Crosser demoed C2 operations running through Zoom and Teams TURN servers. Security monitoring sees legitimate video call traffic.\n- coturn (most common TURN implementation) has had 30+ memory safety fixes, a CVSS 9.8 SQL injection, and we found an IPv6 loopback bypass where the protection code just didn't work (CVE-2020-26262).\n- TURN servers are also abused for DDoS reflection/amplification. Only ~4x factor but they're everywhere and often misconfigured.\n\nPost goes into the technical details of each relay method (Send Indication, ChannelData, TCP Connect), real attack scenarios, and what defense actually looks like.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

So even if the chatbot API isn't OpenAI-compatible, you can configure the request/response format to match whatever you're testing against.",

Most of them check to see if you're looking at them in sandbox tools and they won't arrive at the final locations if you are. I get more data from running them from local. A lot of them are PaaS based phishing kits that are bought off the dark web or backchannel communication platforms. Also, most of the time they use existing public infrastructure to execute in one of the stages post-click; second or third redirect is what I've been finding for that one. That's probably to avoid detection on the surface.",
