The reason I didn't contact Äike and instead emailed the IoT module company was partly because Äike had taken down their customer support page (in the app, at least - it redirected back to the main site), and since I knew that the IoT company and Äike worked closely together (even sharing the management to some degree) and since they're still in business, it was a surefire way to ensure that the disclosure reached the correct people. I didn't share this context in the post, but both Äike and the rental service Tuul were actually spun off from the IoT module company, as they wanted to show the market that their IoT products and modules can be used to build successful products.",

When I returned my Scooter for months I could play pranks on French citizen who got my return before they removed my access. I would not be surprised if the qr codes suplied with device were direct link to scooter and never rotated. \n\nScooter had really poor gsm signal, so it would not reliably unlock indoors. Had motherboqrd die on me and got new scooter as replacement as there was no way to open battery bay once electronics is dead. Yeah, that was how my experience started and it should have been enough of a red signal to fold right then and there. \n\nAs for other issues: multiple motor failiures (apparently they got a bad batch and used it quite a while before they realised it). The maintence was sub-par, I remember having poor experiences with brakes and them saying its okay, don’t think to much of it. No suspension either. Was not really water tight enough for our winters. \n\nTrought my time the experience got worse when they moved from near ex Swedbank over to Loomelinnak area and for me that was final nail in coffin to stop renting it and buy something else. I was the happiest when I got the device and gave it back. \n\nI cannot imagine the experience of riding for anday or two only to return ups it to estonia from anywhere in the world for it to be repaired and sent back. How many back and forths they must have done, surely was atleast partial reason for their fall.",

Is that the total number of n8n servers publicly exposed, or is it the number of public servers that meet the conditions for full exploitation (upload form + some way to retrieve uploaded data)?",

              "text": "Agreed with you. Great write up, and very interesting. \n\nThe number of vulnerable servers appear to be shodan public exposed with appropriate version. Likely not additionally classified with the path to exploitation (the web forum upload + method of retrieval). \n\nI expect it’s more of a ‘potentially exploitable’ not ‘vulnerable’ as there are conditions to meet as you said. However…\n\nIm guessing the author (rightfully so) got excited and wanted to get the vuln out quick so they simulated with an ideal n8n workflow, a working test case (IE: workflow that has publicly accessible user input and a chat bot to fetch data back from). \n\nIm very interested to see what other methods could be utilized to abuse the vuln without the feedback chat bot. I suspect the public user input is a hard requirement but the arbitrary write surely could be used to exfil data without the chat bot component. Perhaps updating a webhook, update url, telemetry call, modification of the same publicly available webpage that provides the user file upload, or perhaps application source files themselves. \n\nVery nifty discovery :) I think it a prime vuln to explore variations of.",

The point isn't that TLS fingerprinting is unbeatable. It's that it's a much higher bar than spoofing a User-Agent string. You need real browser infrastructure, specialized libraries, or proxy services. \n\nThat cost and complexity filters out a lot of scraping traffic.\nJA4 works best as one layer alongside behavioral analysis and honeypots. No single signal wins alone. Fingerprints are just one of the many weighted signals we use in our detection and enrichment pipeline.",
