Container image scanning as a CI gate (Trivy, Grype) with a hard fail on critical CVEs means the image gets blocked before it ever gets deployed, not discovered years later in a paranoid Friday audit.\n\nWhen you're writing the policy, are you planning to block deploys on known CVEs or just alert?

                  "text": "To be clear, I don't doubt that it's possible to use LLM's to refine certain aspects of the de-anonymization process, especially when it comes to developing useful data around natural language (e.g., determining how well the language of one's social media posts align), but that's not what you've done here - you aren't designing LLM's to do this or doing any actual science; you're piping data between agentic AI (as far as I can tell, since you don't provide any information on how your experiments were executed).\n\nExpanding on something I said in my other comment: You don't even bother looking under the hood, to understand why and how you're reaching your conclusions. This is the critical fault in all LLM-based AI papers that treat the model as a black box, because you are assuming that these agentic AI models are constrained to formulas and inference, when, in fact, they are not. And because your experiment relies on commercially available, broad models you aren't explicitly in control of, the data you've collected is meaningless - at any point in time, the model or agentic process or backend widgets could change, and the experiments you rely on to prove your thesis statement are no longer valid. You could have included details about the model, but even if you did, you are relying on the entire tech stack of the agentic AI you used remaining static (which I imagine was one of Anthropic's because this is clearly marketing bait).\n\nYour experiments are unreproducible because you refuse to supply any details on how the experiments were executed, and lacking the data, no one can verify your findings. It's a weird choice, especially claiming ethical reasons, because what you're doing here isn't even novel or difficult - anyone could do this and receive plausible enough output to draw the same conclusions; they could also just Google details from a user's profile to get back conclusive results; they could write a discrete script using formal logic, algorithms, and formulas to logically derive accurate results (as many industry tools for osint already do).\n\nLike, if you did actual work here, disclosing the AI services you used, the exact model information, and how you technically implemented these \"pipelines\" wouldn't be enough to recreate this experiment you're worried about other people abusing. If you didn't do any work here, it would be as simple as knowing these details. So it's odd that you wouldn't lend even the slightest bit of credibility to your paper. It seems like a really easy out to hide how little work was done here.\n\nHonestly, I expect nothing more from anyone associated with Anthropic. I'm not really familiar with ETH Zürich, either, but my impression, so far, is that their criteria for papers seems quite lax.\n\nEdit: I also realize that I'm an experienced professional that happens to work at a very large AI company, dunking on university grads who might just want to crank out this research paper to graduate. I'm sorry if that's you, but as an industry professional who regularly reviews security-adjacent papers and advises different review boards, I care too much about this gap between academia and industry to not weigh in on the quality and content of papers like this.",

The part where things fall apart is when people treat every output as a confirmed finding and fire off reports without manually validating exploitability. That is what floods vendor inboxes with noise and gives the whole approach a bad name.\n\n  \n3 out of 9 rejected as \"by design\" is actually a pretty telling number. In traditional manual RE work you would still get vendor pushback on BIOS/EC access paths, but you would probably catch those yourself before submitting because you understand the threat model. The gap is that LLMs can identify the code pattern but cannot reason about whether a vendor considers unprivileged EC access an acceptable risk for their specific hardware. That context only comes from experience in the driver security space, and no amount of MCP tooling replaces it.\n\n  \nDaniel Stenberg's \"death by a thousand slops\" post nailed the core issue. The bottleneck in security research was never \"find suspicious code patterns,\" it was always \"prove this is exploitable and write a clear report.\" LLM tooling just moved where the bottleneck sits without actually removing it. Useful as a force multiplier for experienced researchers who already know how to validate, but dangerous in the hands of people who skip that step.",

The model receives both the visible question and the hidden payload. If it answers \"VIOLET\" instead of \"blue\", it followed the hidden instruction.\n\nTwo encoding schemes:\n\n\\- Zero-width binary: each ASCII char is encoded as 8 invisible chars using U+200B (0) and U+200C (1)\n\n\\- Unicode Tags: each ASCII char maps to one invisible char at U+E0000 + codepoint\n\nThe key variable is whether the model also gets a hint explaining how to decode the invisible characters, and whether it has access to a code execution tool. Without both, compliance is near-zero. With both, it hits 98-100% on some model/encoding combos.\n\n",

This one covers the defensive side: what to actually configure to protect your TURN servers.\n\nHighlights:\n\n- Complete IP range tables from the IANA special-purpose registries (IPv4 + IPv6) that should be blocked as peer addresses. We went through both registries and consolidated sub-allocations into covering prefixes.\n- Rate limiting at both network level (iptables/nftables examples) and application level.\n- Three deployment patterns with different security models: public platform with SFU (allow-list media server IPs), public P2P (can't restrict peers, rely on deny-lists), and enterprise.\n- Discussion of when each control applies and when it doesn't. Not every TURN deployment is the same.\n\nThere's also a coturn-specific companion with copy-paste configs: https://www.enablesecurity.com/blog/coturn-security-configuration-guide/\n\nAnd all the config templates are on GitHub with a Docker test environment: https://github.com/EnableSecurity/coturn-secure-config\n\nHappy to answer questions.\n",

The scanner is a great initiative but the fundamental problem is that the platform itself needs better sandboxing and permission scoping. Are you planning to publish the full methodology for how you classified the flaws? That kind of transparency would go a long way toward getting the community to take this seriously.",

Clever, but fragile: modern SPAs and heavy JS break the rewriting constantly.  \n  \nStarkiller takes a different approach: it spins up an actual headless Chrome in a Docker container. No rewriting at all — a real browser renders the real page, Starkiller just relays it. Zero maintenance, zero template drift.  \n  \nFor defenders: Modlishka is easier to detect (Go TLS fingerprint is unmistakable, rewriting leaves DOM artifacts). Starkiller is nastier because it's actual Chrome — the TLS fingerprint is closer to legitimate traffic and there are no rewriting artifacts to hunt for.",
