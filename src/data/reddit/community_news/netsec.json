Like not IMEI level identification or Google/Apple IDs?\n\nMy somewhat dated information was that tower triangulation was the way to physically find stuff by LEOs but is that no longer necessary with 4g and later?

Real-world feedback wanted.\n\nSerious OSS project, not a \"quick script\" YAML-based test cases, full HTML/PDF reporting, and already used for vendor bake-offs and CI/CD pipelines. Repo: [https://github.com/wallarm/gotestwaf](https://github.com/wallarm/gotestwaf)\n\nIf you're running any kind of WAF or API security layer, this might be worth a look.\n\n**What it does:** Simulates a broad spectrum of attacks - SQLi, XSS, RCE, path traversal, XXE, SSRF, LDAP/NoSQL injection, mail injection, GraphQL/gRPC/SOAP abuse, and more. Tests both true positives (does it catch attacks) and false positives (does it block legitimate traffic).\n\n**Why it stands out:** The combination approach: payloads × encoders × placeholders. If you have 2 payloads, 3 encoders (base64, URL, JSUnicode), and 4 HTTP positions, that's 24 unique test requests automatically generated. Most tools test payloads in isolation. This catches evasion patterns that slip through single-layer detection.\n\n**API protocols covered:** REST, GraphQL, gRPC, SOAP, XMLRPC - plus raw HTTP for custom requests.\n\n**Output:** YAML-based test cases you can customize. Reports in HTML, PDF, and CSV. Used for vendor comparisons, internal rule tuning, and CI/CD regression testing.",
