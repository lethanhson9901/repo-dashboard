          "text": "This is a real blind spot in most dev workflows right now. Tools like Cursor, Copilot, and Claude Code all create local config files (.cursor/, .github/copilot, [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md), etc.) that can contain project context, API keys referenced in prompts, or even full conversation logs. Most .gitignore templates haven't caught up to include these directories yet, so they end up committed and pushed without anyone noticing.The fix is straightforward but tedious: audit your .gitignore for every AI tool your team uses, run git log searches for accidentally committed config dirs, and treat these directories the same way you'd treat .env files. Some teams are also adding pre-commit hooks that specifically scan for AI tool artifacts.",

Your AI was just the vehicle through which you did. If you left secrets in your repo, that's just you being bad at security. \n\nAlso, most secret scanners are doing heuristic based matching. Does this look like a name? Does this look like SSN number? Does this look like a token? The entire point of those is to find secrets in arbitrary places. AI generated files also qualify. These people just aren't running secret scanners, and likely don't even know what those are.\n\nI essentially see this whole thing as another copy of the late 90s and early 2000s.

But the git history also shows the test suite: 80% unit test coverage, integration tests that spin up a real container, run a malware behavior simulator, and assert that every expected event type was actually captured. Linter and security scan on every PR. All in CI, you can check it yourself.\nThe eBPF programs and the cgroup filtering logic were the parts I reviewed most carefully line by line, because that’s where a subtle bug would actually matter from a security perspective. That’s not something you can ship on vibes and hope for the best.\nThe idea that agentic coding and actually understanding your codebase are mutually exclusive is worth pushing back on. The question is whether the author can reason about what the code does and why. Happy to go deep on any specific part if you want to probe that.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

If I can push a hash of my choosing, I can just push a hash that I know the password so this isn't about account takeover. And it has to be an account I can change the password for, so there's no permission bypass here.\n\nYou can, indeed, voluntarily weaken your own password through an unorthodox procedure. That has no bearing on most users and doesn't make existing hashes that follow policy easier to crack. That's also not discreet as the user who's password you change will notice that their password has changed (and probably change it in return).\n\nMaybe there's a scenario where you use malware to change someone's password to something easier to crack, but again why change it to something you have to crack at all?\n\nSorry, but I really don't see the problem. If the only way to escape policy is through a non-standard procedure that requires proper authorization, then there's no security theater at play. You can voluntarily downgrade your own password. It would probably be better if it wasn't the case, but it doesn't invalidate the impact of the policy at scale, and if your goal is to facilitate someone breaking into your account, just give them the password. It'll leave less traces than changing your own password to something easier to crack.",

Most organizations are focused on input sanitization, but the real danger is in persistence mechanisms where injected content gets written to context stores, vector databases, or agent memory.\n\n\n\nFrom a practical red team perspective, the highest success rate attacks I've seen combine two or three techniques in sequence. Start with translation obfuscation to bypass basic filters, use role play to establish a trusted context, then inject the actual payload through indirect means so it appears to come from a legitimate data source rather than user input.\n\n\n\nThe hardest part about defending against this is that effective mitigation requires architectural changes, not just better prompts. You need content signing, strict output encoding based on destination context, and proper separation between instruction channels and data channels. But most production systems treat everything as a string and hope prompt engineering will save them.\n\n\n\nThe taxonomy helps because it forces you to think about attack chains rather than individual techniques. Defense in depth means breaking the chain at multiple points, which means you need to map your architecture to the attack surface this framework describes.",

The core issue is that LLM systems conflate data and instruction planes, and there's no enforced separation the way there is in, say, SQL parameterized queries. When a retrieval step can modify the instruction context without going through a separate validation layer, you have a structural vulnerability regardless of how the injected text looks.\n\n\n\nFor agentic systems specifically, the attack surface expands significantly because injected content can persist across tool calls and context windows. A payload that lands in a memory store during one session can execute in a completely different security context later. This is where purely text-technique-based defenses fail: the payload is dormant and innocuous at storage time.\n\n\n\nThe intent classification approach makes more sense for training-time or fine-tuning mitigations, but for runtime detection you really want to be monitoring for behavioral anomalies: unusual tool call sequences, unexpected data exfiltration patterns, privilege escalation in capability use. The taxonomy in this post is a solid framework for building red team test cases though.",

We do this atomically rather than checking existence separately, which would create a window where an attacker could swap the symlink between our check and resolution.\n\nOn macOS, the sandbox enforces against literal path strings rather than resolved paths. So we store both the original path and the resolved real path, then emit sandbox rules for both. Without this, granting access via the real path would still block programs trying to use the symlink.\n\nWe also use proper path component comparison rather than string comparison when checking path relationships.  String prefix matching would incorrectly match paths that just happen to share the same starting characters but aren't actually descendants of the directory in question.\n\nWe also handle parent directory traversal. To access a deeply nested path, programs need to stat each parent directory along the way. We automatically allow metadata-only access to parent directories of granted paths, walking both the original and resolved path hierarchies when they differ.\n\nTaking a look at the blog thanks!   ",

              "text": "Containers and nono solve overlapping but distinct problems, and each has real trade-offs worth considering. There is a section in the docs on this: https://docs.nono.sh/security/containers \n\nContainers give you isolation through namespacing - the process sees a different filesystem root, network stack, and process tree. This is powerful for reproducibility and portability. You can ship a known-good environment, and anything the AI does stays inside that container's view of the world. The downside is that containers are coarse-grained. You either mount a volume into the container or you don't. There's no easy way to say \"read the whole project but only write to the src directory\" or \"access ~/.vscode , but not ~/.ssh/.\" You end up either over-permissioning (mounting your whole home directory) or dealing with friction every time the AI needs something outside the container.\n\nnono takes the opposite approach - it runs natively on your host but uses OS-level mandatory access control (Landlock on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS) to enforce fine-grained capabilities. You can grant read access to your entire codebase while restricting writes to specific directories, block access to credentials and browser data regardless of what commands run, and allow network access while still protecting sensitive local paths. The sandbox is applied to the process itself, not to a virtualized environment, so there's no filesystem copying, no Docker daemon, and near-zero startup overhead. \n\nWhere nono is stronger: granularity. You can express policies like \"read everywhere, write only here, never touch my SSH keys\" that would be awkward or impossible with container volume mounts. It also integrates more naturally with local tooling - your shell, your editor, your existing workflows all just work. \n\nWhere containers are stronger: they provide a complete environment boundary. If the AI installs a malicious package or corrupts system files, it's contained to that throwaway environment. With nono, you're still running on your real system - the sandbox prevents unauthorized access, but if you grant write access to a directory, the AI can still make a mess there (having said that we have an atomic undo system incoming).\n\nThe honest answer is they're complimentary. You can run nono inside a container for defense in depth, or use nono alone when you want lightweight, precise control without the overhead of containerization. It depends on which you value portability and environment isolation (containers) or fine-grained capability control with minimal friction (nono). \n\nThe other factor is nono has a load of other features thrown in, key protection, blocking of dangerous commands, and quite a bit more inbound. \n\nBut honestly, if containers are working, great! I am a fan and its never x vs y here, each have their own strengths.",

          "text": "The Landlock approach here is interesting because it addresses something that apparmor and seccomp profiles don't handle as cleanly: the problem that AI coding agents need some filesystem access to be useful, but you want that access to be scoped to the project directory and denied elsewhere by default.\n\n\n\nThe key architectural insight is putting enforcement at the kernel level rather than relying on the agent's own guardrails. Application-layer filtering is exactly what prompt injection is designed to bypass, so the security model collapses precisely when you need it most. Kernel-enforced Landlock LSM rules survive prompt injection because the agent process literally cannot make those syscalls regardless of what instructions it receives.\n\n\n\nA few edge cases worth thinking about for the threat model:\n\n\n\n1. Legitimate agent workflows that need broad access (e.g., reading environment configs across the home directory) will require allow-list configuration, which creates friction that might push users to over-permission the allow list.\n\n\n\n2. Network egress isn't mentioned. An agent that can make outbound connections could exfiltrate data or download additional payloads even with filesystem restrictions intact. Combining Landlock with network namespace restrictions or seccomp filtering on socket calls would be the complete picture.\n\n\n\n3. The credential exfiltration mitigation for \\~/.ssh and \\~/.aws is valuable, but intermediate credential storage (e.g., in-memory secrets passed via env vars) is still visible to the process.\n\n\n\nSolid project overall. The deny-by-default model is the right foundation.",

Any AI agent that has write access to a repository, publish permissions, or the ability to trigger workflows is now a viable lateral movement path if it can be influenced through untrusted input channels.\n\n\n\nThe issue triager case is particularly interesting because the trust model for an issue tracker is fundamentally inverted from what you want in a privileged pipeline component. Issues are designed to be submitted by anyone, including external reporters who are not vetted contributors. Wiring a model with deployment permissions to that input channel without strict output constraints and intent verification is a significant architectural mistake.\n\n\n\nThe broader pattern is that many teams are integrating agents into workflows where they inherit permissions far beyond what their actual tasks require. An agent that labels and triages issues needs read access and label write access. It does not need release artifact permissions or the ability to approve PRs. The principle of least privilege applies to AI agents at least as much as it does to service accounts, but the tooling to scope agent permissions precisely is still immature.\n\n\n\nThe GHSA advisory albinowax linked about the self-propagation angle makes this worse. Once the agent can be turned against the repository it's supposed to protect, you're looking at a persistence mechanism that survives rotations and reviews that would catch traditional backdoors.",
