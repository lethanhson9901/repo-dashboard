Tools like Cursor, Copilot, and Claude Code all create local config files (.cursor/, .github/copilot, [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md), etc.) that can contain project context, API keys referenced in prompts, or even full conversation logs. Most .gitignore templates haven't caught up to include these directories yet, so they end up committed and pushed without anyone noticing.The fix is straightforward but tedious: audit your .gitignore for every AI tool your team uses, run git log searches for accidentally committed config dirs, and treat these directories the same way you'd treat .env files. Some teams are also adding pre-commit hooks that specifically scan for AI tool artifacts.",

Your AI was just the vehicle through which you did. If you left secrets in your repo, that's just you being bad at security. \n\nAlso, most secret scanners are doing heuristic based matching. Does this look like a name? Does this look like SSN number? Does this look like a token? The entire point of those is to find secrets in arbitrary places. AI generated files also qualify. These people just aren't running secret scanners, and likely don't even know what those are.\n\nI essentially see this whole thing as another copy of the late 90s and early 2000s.

          "text": "Been poking at TURN server security since 2017 and finally wrote this up.\n\nIf you're not familiar with TURN: it's the fallback relay for WebRTC when direct peer-to-peer fails. It can relay both TCP and UDP to arbitrary peer addresses, so if not properly restricted, you've got an open proxy that can reach internal networks, localhost, cloud metadata services, etc.\n\nSome highlights:\n\n- During pentests we regularly find TURN servers that can reach internal networks, localhost, cloud metadata (169.254.169.254). If peer addresses aren't restricted, it's game over.\n- At DEF CON 2025, Adam Crosser demoed C2 operations running through Zoom and Teams TURN servers. Security monitoring sees legitimate video call traffic.\n- coturn (most common TURN implementation) has had 30+ memory safety fixes, a CVSS 9.8 SQL injection, and we found an IPv6 loopback bypass where the protection code just didn't work (CVE-2020-26262).\n- TURN servers are also abused for DDoS reflection/amplification. Only ~4x factor but they're everywhere and often misconfigured.\n\nPost goes into the technical details of each relay method (Send Indication, ChannelData, TCP Connect), real attack scenarios, and what defense actually looks like.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

Most organizations are focused on input sanitization, but the real danger is in persistence mechanisms where injected content gets written to context stores, vector databases, or agent memory.\n\n\n\nFrom a practical red team perspective, the highest success rate attacks I've seen combine two or three techniques in sequence. Start with translation obfuscation to bypass basic filters, use role play to establish a trusted context, then inject the actual payload through indirect means so it appears to come from a legitimate data source rather than user input.\n\n\n\nThe hardest part about defending against this is that effective mitigation requires architectural changes, not just better prompts. You need content signing, strict output encoding based on destination context, and proper separation between instruction channels and data channels. But most production systems treat everything as a string and hope prompt engineering will save them.\n\n\n\nThe taxonomy helps because it forces you to think about attack chains rather than individual techniques. Defense in depth means breaking the chain at multiple points, which means you need to map your architecture to the attack surface this framework describes.",

Most of them check to see if you're looking at them in sandbox tools and they won't arrive at the final locations if you are. I get more data from running them from local. A lot of them are PaaS based phishing kits that are bought off the dark web or backchannel communication platforms. Also, most of the time they use existing public infrastructure to execute in one of the stages post-click; second or third redirect is what I've been finding for that one. That's probably to avoid detection on the surface.",

We do this atomically rather than checking existence separately, which would create a window where an attacker could swap the symlink between our check and resolution.\n\nOn macOS, the sandbox enforces against literal path strings rather than resolved paths. So we store both the original path and the resolved real path, then emit sandbox rules for both. Without this, granting access via the real path would still block programs trying to use the symlink.\n\nWe also use proper path component comparison rather than string comparison when checking path relationships.  String prefix matching would incorrectly match paths that just happen to share the same starting characters but aren't actually descendants of the directory in question.\n\nWe also handle parent directory traversal. To access a deeply nested path, programs need to stat each parent directory along the way. We automatically allow metadata-only access to parent directories of granted paths, walking both the original and resolved path hierarchies when they differ.\n\nTaking a look at the blog thanks!   ",

              "text": "Containers and nono solve overlapping but distinct problems, and each has real trade-offs worth considering. There is a section in the docs on this: https://docs.nono.sh/security/containers \n\nContainers give you isolation through namespacing - the process sees a different filesystem root, network stack, and process tree. This is powerful for reproducibility and portability. You can ship a known-good environment, and anything the AI does stays inside that container's view of the world. The downside is that containers are coarse-grained. You either mount a volume into the container or you don't. There's no easy way to say \"read the whole project but only write to the src directory\" or \"access ~/.vscode , but not ~/.ssh/.\" You end up either over-permissioning (mounting your whole home directory) or dealing with friction every time the AI needs something outside the container.\n\nnono takes the opposite approach - it runs natively on your host but uses OS-level mandatory access control (Landlock on Linux, Seatbelt on macOS) to enforce fine-grained capabilities. You can grant read access to your entire codebase while restricting writes to specific directories, block access to credentials and browser data regardless of what commands run, and allow network access while still protecting sensitive local paths. The sandbox is applied to the process itself, not to a virtualized environment, so there's no filesystem copying, no Docker daemon, and near-zero startup overhead. \n\nWhere nono is stronger: granularity. You can express policies like \"read everywhere, write only here, never touch my SSH keys\" that would be awkward or impossible with container volume mounts. It also integrates more naturally with local tooling - your shell, your editor, your existing workflows all just work. \n\nWhere containers are stronger: they provide a complete environment boundary. If the AI installs a malicious package or corrupts system files, it's contained to that throwaway environment. With nono, you're still running on your real system - the sandbox prevents unauthorized access, but if you grant write access to a directory, the AI can still make a mess there (having said that we have an atomic undo system incoming).\n\nThe honest answer is they're complimentary. You can run nono inside a container for defense in depth, or use nono alone when you want lightweight, precise control without the overhead of containerization. It depends on which you value portability and environment isolation (containers) or fine-grained capability control with minimal friction (nono). \n\nThe other factor is nono has a load of other features thrown in, key protection, blocking of dangerous commands, and quite a bit more inbound. \n\nBut honestly, if containers are working, great! I am a fan and its never x vs y here, each have their own strengths.",

Using YAML for security-sensitive configurations always feels like playing with fire because of these weird edge cases with tags and merging. I've been following Orbon Cloud that's looking at more consistent ways to handle these kinds of data layer complexities. They aren't fully launched yet, but they have an Alpha program for early access if you're interested in checking out how they're tackling it.",
