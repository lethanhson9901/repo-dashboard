      "text": "At some point over the summer, I wanted to try out some image and video models from HF locally, but I didn't want to open up my IDE and hardcode my prompts each time. I've been looking for tools that would give me an Ollama CLI-like experience, but I couldn't find anything like that, so I started building something for myself. It works with the models I'm interested in and more. \n\nSince then, I haven't checked if there are any similar or better tools because this one meets my needs, but maybe there's something new out there already. I'm just sharing it in case it's useful to anyone else for quickly running image-to-image, text-to-image, text-to-video, text-to-speech and speech-to-text models locally. Definitely, if you have AMD GPUs like I do.\n\n[https://github.com/zb-ss/hftool](https://github.com/zb-ss/hftool)",

      "text": "I received my **Reachy Mini**, and instead of sticking with the usual “SSH-terminal juggling” workflow, I wanted to see if I could configure something that feels closer to modern day IDE workflow using VS Code as a base.\n\nThe goal for this IDE:  \n \\- Remote development directly on Reachy Mini  \n \\- Run programs inside Reachy Mini’s App Python environement   \n \\- Full Python debugging support  \n \\- Primitive, but realtime performance monitoring \n\nI ended up combining VS Code with [Remote SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh), [SSH monitor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=femtowork.ssh-remote-monitor) and installation of [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) in Remote Extension Host to enable debugging. Full step-by-step guide availlable [here](https://tobrun.github.io/blog/reachy-mini-ide/) \n\n[Remote Python Debugging](https://preview.redd.it/c6m4olwgy6ag1.png?width=2384&format=png&auto=webp&s=f02c52af4d71dd3127a758c44cbf590925596c7b)\n\n",
