GPT-OSS-20B won't even load in 4-bit quantization on my machine. So I spent weeks trying to make a version that actually runs on normal hardware. This is GPT-OSS-Nano. Built for people like me who don't have a server rack under their desk. \n\n**The pruning**\n\nStarted from the 20B intermediate checkpoint and did structured pruning down to 9B. Gradient-based importance scoring for heads and FFN layers. After the cut the model was honestly kind of dumb - reasoning performance tanked pretty hard. Expected, but still rough to see.\n\n**Fine-tuning**\n\n100K chain-of-thought gpt oss 120B examples (math, logic, code). QLoRA on an H200 with Unsloth — about 2x faster than vanilla training. 2 epochs, nothing fancy.\n\nThe SFT made a bigger difference than I expected post-pruning. The model went from producing vaguely structured outputs to actually laying out steps properly.\n\nWeights are up on HF if anyone wants to poke at it:  \n [huggingface.co/squ11z1/gpt-oss-nano](http://huggingface.co/squ11z1/gpt-oss-nano)",

          "text": "\"billing alignment matters more than peak latency\" — this is underrated. When you say that, are you tracking cost per model per hour, or more like idle VRAM as a % of total spend?\n\nCurious how you picked the H100 for this in the first place. Did you size it for the long tail or for peak concurrent models?",

              "text": "When I say billing alignment, I’m mostly looking at effective utilization over time. Specifically, how much VRAM is allocated but not actively serving tokens. In bursty, long tail workloads, idle residency can quietly dominate total spend.\n\nOn sizing, the H100 was chosen less for peak token throughput and more for memory headroom. With 200 to 300 distinct models, concurrency isn’t just about active requests. It’s about how many models compete for residency under memory pressure.",
