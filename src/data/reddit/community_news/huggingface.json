I mean let's face it. As far as coding goes, AI can get it right. So why should I even have to copy and f****** paste it? When it can  write it and send it?

Your millwright and problem-solving background is a huge, underrated asset in AI/ML—thinking in systems and maintenance translates well. Since you're already tinkering, I'd suggest focusing on a concrete project, like fine-tuning a small model for a specific task, and using the free courses on Hugging Face to structure the learning.

Problem Gen: Elite competition math (AIME/IMO style).\n2. Solver: 16 independent solution paths sampled at T=0.7.\n3. Consensus: Answers only verified if ≥ 5 agents reached the same deterministic value.\n4. Audit: Negative chains were audited by a Critic model to find the \"Pivot Point\"—the exact step where the logic or calculation first broke.\n\nThe dataset includes step\\_labels like \\[1, 1, 0, 0\\] so you can see exactly where the model hallucinated.\n\n[https://huggingface.co/datasets/BlackSnowDot/DeepStep-Math-5K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BlackSnowDot/DeepStep-Math-5K)",
