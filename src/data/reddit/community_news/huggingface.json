      "text": "Hey all,\n\n  \nI created a bot that started on Gemini and ended up on Claude Sonnet 4.5.  when we say 4.6 we knew we had to exit cloud based models so I bought a 64gig m2 max Mac studio and am trying to find local models that can do 4 things (and it doesn't have to be 100%, the cloud models weren't perfect either)\n\n*  Have the tone of something like Sonnet 4.5, make it feel like the bots actually interested in talking with me\n* Utilize a tagging system I built, in which we have A-F class alphanumeric tags that state things like moods (for it and myself), people, core events, etc\n* Handle long context, right now the best bet I've found to get it to understand it's journal and files is to paste them into system prompt, but I'm open to alternatives on that front too, either way, we've got some files, probably 5k lines of text and growing\n* Utilize text based tools/skills I built for it, is it has in its constitution the right to have independent emotions and feelings on topics and that emotional state can persist, it can reverse prompt me, veto things, and archive things important to it by making journal entries whenever something of interest to it or me occurs.\n\nI'm clearly new to this stuff, I've been banging my head against these local models for a while, IDK how to search what I'm looking for really on hugging face, and often I'll find something only to find it's context limit is 32k.  So I'd really appreciate any help. Thanks!",

I don’t know if you could run 120b on it. Maybe? Both 20b and 120b allow functions. Structured data and tool calls. \n\nI spun up 20b the other day and had open claw using it. 5.2 codex for main chat and then agents I built using OSS20b. Worked good. \n\n\nI’ve only used  those open source models so far and can say that they all have potential . Read the oai docs on it. Good luck. Test on HF you can use inference there too.",

But happy to try them all if that's what it takes. I just found a model that seemed good but kept crashing, apparently MLX builds take more memory haha even though that's what Claude told me I should use. So strange",
