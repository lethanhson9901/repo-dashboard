It generates a GitHub-style contribution heatmap (grass) based on your Hugging Face activity.\n\nIt produces an SVG that you can easily embed in your GitHub README. It also comes with a GitHub Actions workflow, so it updates automatically every day!\n\n**Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas! 🎄✨**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1aommmehj69g1.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee67f2147ab482119cd5a994f7e243476f86b08d\n\n[https://github.com/kbsooo/hf-grass](https://github.com/kbsooo/hf-grass)",

      "text": "At some point over the summer, I wanted to try out some image and video models from HF locally, but I didn't want to open up my IDE and hardcode my prompts each time. I've been looking for tools that would give me an Ollama CLI-like experience, but I couldn't find anything like that, so I started building something for myself. It works with the models I'm interested in and more. \n\nSince then, I haven't checked if there are any similar or better tools because this one meets my needs, but maybe there's something new out there already. I'm just sharing it in case it's useful to anyone else for quickly running image-to-image, text-to-image, text-to-video, text-to-speech and speech-to-text models locally. Definitely, if you have AMD GPUs like I do.\n\n[https://github.com/zb-ss/hftool](https://github.com/zb-ss/hftool)",

      "text": "Hey all,\n\nI’ve been exploring how transformer models handle legal text and noticed that most open summarizers miss specificity; they simplify too much. That led me to build **LexiBrief**, a fine-tuned Google FLAN-T5 model trained on *BillSum* using QLoRA for efficiency.\n\n[https://huggingface.co/AryanT11/lexibrief-legal-summarizer](https://huggingface.co/AryanT11/lexibrief-legal-summarizer)\n\nIt generates concise, clause-preserving summaries of legal and policy documents, kind of like a TL;DR that still respects the law’s intent.\n\nMetrics:\n\n* ROUGE-L F1: **0.72**\n* BERTScore (F1): **0.86**\n* Hallucinations (FactCC): **↓35% vs base FLAN-T5**\n\nIt’s up on Hugging Face if you want to play around with it. I’d love feedback from anyone who’s worked on factual summarization or domain-specific LLM tuning.",
