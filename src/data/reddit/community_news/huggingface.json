      "text": "Just came across this and thought it was worth sharing — GLONET is now available on HuggingFace.\n\nIt’s a deep learning model for global ocean forecasting that runs in less than 3 seconds. Trained on 30 years of ocean reanalysis data, it can predict oceanographic variables (temperature, salinity, currents…) at a global scale.\n\nNot gonna lie, this might just make traditional physics-based ocean models obsolete\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/mercator-ocean/GLONET",

GPT-OSS-20B won't even load in 4-bit quantization on my machine. So I spent weeks trying to make a version that actually runs on normal hardware. This is GPT-OSS-Nano. Built for people like me who don't have a server rack under their desk. \n\n**The pruning**\n\nStarted from the 20B intermediate checkpoint and did structured pruning down to 9B. Gradient-based importance scoring for heads and FFN layers. After the cut the model was honestly kind of dumb - reasoning performance tanked pretty hard. Expected, but still rough to see.\n\n**Fine-tuning**\n\n100K chain-of-thought gpt oss 120B examples (math, logic, code). QLoRA on an H200 with Unsloth — about 2x faster than vanilla training. 2 epochs, nothing fancy.\n\nThe SFT made a bigger difference than I expected post-pruning. The model went from producing vaguely structured outputs to actually laying out steps properly.\n\nWeights are up on HF if anyone wants to poke at it:  \n [huggingface.co/squ11z1/gpt-oss-nano](http://huggingface.co/squ11z1/gpt-oss-nano)",
