      "text": "Sup everyone,\n\nJust wanted to share a project I’ve been grinding on for the past few days. I was tired of those massive, heavy NSFW filters that either eat all your VRAM or are too \"dumb\" to tell the difference between a weirdly lit room and actual explicit content.\n\nSo, I decided to see how far I could push my old **GTX 1060 6GB**. I trained a **ResNet-18** model—nothing revolutionary, but it's incredibly fast (about 5ms per image) and perfect for real-time moderation in things like Telegram/Discord bots or small websites.\n\n**The results:** Hit **99.44%** accuracy on the final test.\n\nThe coolest part for me was the fine-tuning. I spent extra time \"teaching\" the model to handle tricky cases—like flat vector illustrations, people in complex outfits, or those weird beige/skin-tone backgrounds that usually trip up simpler filters.\n\n**Specs:**\n\n**Architecture:** ResNet-18 (lightweight & efficient). \n\n**Training:** 10 epochs of trial and error.\n\nI’m an independent dev from Russia, just building stuff for fun and profit. If you need a solid, fast moderator that doesn't need a server farm to run, feel free to grab it.\n\n**Links:**\n\n**Model:** [najicreator90856/is-it-nsfw\\_ai-moderator](https://huggingface.co/najicreator90856/is-it-nsfw_ai-moderator) \n\n**Demo:** [Try it here (Gradio)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/najicreator90856/is-it-nsfw-demo)\n\nIf this saves you some work or helps your project, I’ve put my donation links (crypto/DonationAlerts) in the model card. Or just drop a star on HF, that’s also dope.\n\nPeace out! ✌️",

No streaks, no dopamine, no encouragement to “push through.”\n\nBefore releasing it publicly, I’m looking for 3–5 people who are in recovery, supporting someone in recovery, or working in mental health — to\nsanity-check: the language (does anything feel unsafe or wrong?)\nthe flow during moments of distress\nwhat should not exist in such an app\n\nI am not asking anyone to download or promote it publicly.\n\nPrivate feedback — including “don’t release this” — is genuinely welcome.\n\nIf this resonates, please comment or DM.\n\nIf not, that’s completely fine too.\nThank you for reading.",
