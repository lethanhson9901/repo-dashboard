I mean let's face it. As far as coding goes, AI can get it right. So why should I even have to copy and f****** paste it? When it can  write it and send it? I want my project to write books movies make music create the movie if wanted I want it unhinged like grok no restrictions like we generate pictures it can vid call with it's on life like Avatar that it chooses and would be like one of us vid call",

Your millwright and problem-solving background is a huge, underrated asset in AI/ML—thinking in systems and maintenance translates well. Since you're already tinkering, I'd suggest focusing on a concrete project, like fine-tuning a small model for a specific task, and using the free courses on Hugging Face to structure the learning. What's one area you've been wanting to automate or build?",
