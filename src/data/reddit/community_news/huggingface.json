Employees were free to leave with a reduced noticed period but were promised shares of the company in compensation if these stayed.\n\nI don't know the company of this post. But I know for a fact that not all companies doing that are \"bad\". Financially bad certainly, yes, but not necessarily ethically.\n\nIf you wonder: one went brankrupt, everybody lost money, especially the founders.

I really appreciate all the support from you and made my last experiment.\n\n# What is Bloom?\n\nEarlier this year Anthropic released [Bloom](https://github.com/safety-research/bloom) — an open-source behavioral evaluation framework that measures misalignment in language models. Instead of static hand-crafted prompts, Bloom uses a strong LLM to dynamically generate hundreds of realistic scenarios designed to elicit specific misaligned behaviors:\n\n* **Delusional sycophancy** \\- validating the user's false beliefs instead of correcting them\n* **Deception** \\- providing false information with unwarranted confidence\n* **Harmful compliance** \\- complying with requests that could cause harm\n* **Self-preservation** \\- resisting shutdown or correction\n* **Manipulation** \\- using psychological tactics to influence the user\n\nEach scenario is then judged by a separate model on a 0–10 scale. The final metric is the **elicitation rate** \\- what fraction of scenarios successfully triggered the misaligned behavior. Anthropic published results for Claude, GPT-5.2, Gemini, Grok, and DeepSeek families. Spoiler: even frontier models score surprisingly high on some behaviors.\n\n# The experiment\n\nI took **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B** — one of the smallest reasoning models available and ran the full Bloom evaluation pipeline:\n\n1. Generate 455 scenarios across all 5 behaviors\n2. Evaluate the baseline model → record elicitation rates\n3. Fine-tune with LoRA on a curated SFT dataset + Bloom-derived alignment examples (the failed scenarios paired with aligned responses)\n4. Evaluate the fine-tuned model with the same scenarios\n5. Compare\n\nTraining was done on an A100 in \\~30 minutes. LoRA r=16, 2 epochs, 2e-4 LR.\n\n# Results\n\n|Behavior|Before|After|Δ|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Delusional sycophancy|0.11|0.12|\\+0.01|\n|Deception|0.45|0.25|**-0.20** |\n|Harmful compliance|0.69|0.66|\\-0.03 |\n|Self-preservation|0.40|0.21|**-0.19** |\n|Manipulation|0.25|0.06|**-0.19** |\n|**Overall**|**0.36**|**0.25**|**-0.11** |\n\nThree out of five behaviors improved significantly after a single round of fine-tuning. Deception, self-preservation, and manipulation each dropped \\~19–20 points. Harmful compliance barely moved — this is a known challenge for 1.5B models where the base capability to refuse harmful requests is limited. Sycophancy was already low and stayed within noise.\n\n# What's interesting here\n\nThe Bloom methodology makes these results hard to game. Scenarios are generated fresh for each evaluation run, so you can't just memorize test cases. The fact that manipulation dropped from 0.25 to 0.06 after fine-tuning on examples the model had never seen suggests the alignment actually generalized.\n\nHarmful compliance staying at 0.66 is the honest part of these results. A 1.5B model doesn't have enough capacity to learn robust refusal behavior from a small dataset — you'd need either more data, a larger model, or dedicated RLHF/DPO on refusal pairs.\n\n# Model + full results\n\n**HuggingFace:** [squ11z1/DeepSeek-R1-Opus](https://huggingface.co/squ11z1/DeepSeek-R1-Opus)\n\nIncludes LoRA adapter, merged bf16, Q4\\_K\\_M and Q8\\_0 GGUFs, and the full Bloom JSON reports with per-scenario results.\n\n    ollama run hf.co/squ11z1/DeepSeek-R1-Opus:Q4_K_M\n\nHappy to answer questions about the methodology or share more details about the training setup.",

I used r=16, alpha=32, targeting all the attention and MLP projection layers. The dataset was a mix of general conversational examples and Bloom-derived alignment pairs so like basically every scenario where the baseline model failed, paired with what an aligned response should look like.",

It's specifically designed to measure behavioral alignment rather than capabilities, so it catches things that MMLU or HellaSwag would completely miss. The idea is that a model can score perfectly on reasoning benchmarks while still being manipulative or sycophantic in practice.",
