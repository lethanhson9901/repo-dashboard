Cursor will likely lose a lot of users in the future because there will be little value in coding with cheaper models.  You already see this happening, Opus 4.5 isn't cheap and yet who would build anything significant on anything else?\n\nPeople aren't going to be able to afford to learn the high end models that companies want to hire for without a significant investment.  \n\nThere is no future where the cutting edge model is also the most affordable.  This means a lot less users for products like Cursor, at some point - probably this year.  This is why I believe they don't really care about their current customers.",

One skill that uses scripts and prompting to generate boilerplate templates for new API endpoints, schemas, integrations, etc and also kicks off planning agent to build spec, test, arch, etc with some embedded info (like related codebase context and updating/writing docs after all tests pass).\n\nAnother that builds agents.md in a directory if it doesn't exist and then creates or updates documentation for existing flows, components, functions, logic, and external micro service dependencies and relationships.\n\nIt's nice to just be able to say things like \"document the /v3/API/endpoint\" and have it follow a clear pattern that produces various structured outputs. \n\nThen something like: \"add <new_field> to the endpoint\" and have it do everything based on the skill and related scripts depending on if new API or modification. It will even check if we have DB indexes setup already, related schemas, and interact with AWS using some other scripts if I allow it to. \n\nIt took like a day to build these. But I am not an engineer by trade. That said, my lead engineer on the API and DB both reviewed and approved the skills and outputs after some minor feedback, so that was reassuring!",

      "text": "I keep seeing YouTube videos and news reports claiming that AI hasn’t really improved programmer productivity, and I honestly find that hard to believe. A common claim is that AI boosts productivity for junior developers but actually *reduces* productivity for senior devs.\n\nThat makes me wonder: am I secretly a junior in disguise, or are people just dumb and not using AI very effectively?\n\nPersonally, I’ve found AI to be a huge productivity boost. As I’ve gained more experience using it—and as the models themselves have improved—I’ve noticed I’m making fewer mistakes, not more. While people often say “AI writes bad code,” even setting code generation aside, the gains from faster debugging, troubleshooting, research, and environment setup feel very real.\n\nFor example, I recently ran into MySQL Workbench issues after an upgrade. ChatGPT helped me diagnose and fix it in about 15 minutes. Years ago, that would’ve meant trawling through docs and Stack Overflow threads for hours.\n\nCurious what others think, especially senior devs. Has AI actually hurt your productivity, or does it depend on how you use it? Why is there this narrative that it's not helping with productivity??",

The productivity boost is real, tangible, and exponential. 10x is not an exaggeration here.\n2. **Corp Mode:** I see my devs using Cursor/Copilot and loving it. They are definitely coding faster and building cool internal tools. **However**, our official project timelines? **Zero change.**\n\n**Why?** Because in a corporate environment, 'writing code' was never the bottleneck. The bottleneck is alignment, meetings, PR reviews, CI/CD pipelines, legacy integration, and compliance.\n\nAI made the 'typing' part instant, but it didn't solve the organizational friction.

We're finding that we're addressing bugs and enhancements that, otherwise, we may not have bothered to do before but with AI, we might take a crack at it. For example, there may be some code refactoring or cleanup that we can whip through quickly and just get done. There's not necessarily any immediate impact for end users or for bottom line revenues - the benefit comes 8 years later when a junior developer has to write a new method and it's easier for her because someone else cleaned up the code 8 years prior.

Some findings don't fit our architecture and flows exactly since we have some hacky ways of doing things, but we just create a rule when that happens to clean it up. \n\nI'm separately building a ground up new version of one of our core apps in completely diff environment (vercel for now, instead of AWS) and just connecting to our APIs for data. Its in classic ai stack of node (not next), react, typescript, tailwind. I have been using AI tools since early 2023 so I have a pretty rock solid environment setup for it. I built all of our existing functionality in about 3 weeks and am now enhancing and expanding things building in features our customers have wanted for years, but we're difficult or impossible to build in our legacy app. Frontend is super quick, like multiple releases a week, and backend stuff is still pretty fast when I need to make changes. Main bottleneck there is testing and review for anything that might touch DB or handle sensitive pii/phi, and managing AWS environment for a few things that deal with those services. \n\nIt's crazy because I am not a dev and only have about 2.5yrs of comp sci under my belt (2005-2007, so we were just getting deep into JavaScript when I switched majors). I am very technical, building PCs and doing script kiddie shit from childhood, and was a senior server and network admin for many years, so I understand things at a high level and know to be careful. But my code passes human and AI reviews regularly, and I take care to run multiple security evals each month just to be sure (will prob automate this once I can get a budget for another CC or codex sub).",

Once the hacks are untwisted development is *much* faster... and the whole codebase is now available to be improved going forward.\n\nIt was a tough month of work, even with AI assistance, and a comparatively small codebase, so I can see why some do not see much of a speedup, but with effort it really speeds development.",

It _always_ accrues as you build a solution, because your code _always_ tends to drift from the ideal solution.\n\nBy building and observing use, you discover more about the problem. When you build the next thing to better align with your new understanding of the problem, you are building on a potentially sub-optimal foundation. As you keep doing this, your abstractions become more complex, and new features become harder to implement.\n\nEngineering to resolve tech debt seeks to realign your codebase with your new understanding of the problem. You simplify your abstractions, reduce the complexity of new features, and improve velocity again.\n\nObviously, all of this is easier if you build with and maintain a clean code structure in the first place.\n\nSorry to nitpick, but misuse of the phrase _tech debt_ is a personal bugbear. This might be a bit \"old man shouts at cloud\" but I'm old so ::shrug::. But I don't want this to take away from your comment, which again, I completely agree with!",

Don’t get me wrong, I hate paying for cursor too.\n\nThe closest I’d say out of all of them that have this context awareness is windsurf. You can tell it does have some deeper searching abilities over just grep. However cursor really perfected this total awareness and that’s why they have a monopoly and can charge as much as they do.

I think one of the biggest advantages is its ability to spawn sub agents and actually monitor and respond to builds.

My $20 Pro subscription is maxing out in just three days of heavy use.\n\nNow I’m considering switching to Claude Code, specifically because the 5 hour usage reset? Seems much more sustainable for my workflow. I also find the quality of the Claude Opus model a lot better than the models I use in Cursor to save tokens.\n\nNow to my Question:  \nI work on the massive decompiled \"Hytale\" source (+2000 different files). Cursor's indexing handles this like a charm, I can simply ask it to 'look at the decompiled source to code X' and it works perfectly, but since Claude Code doesn't index the same way, I'm worried it'll burn tokens just trying to find the right functions and right classes.\n\nDoes it actually work for 'vibe coding' at that scale?",

Today I'm using my $200 plan and I've already passed $60 of usage so I'm trying to just work in Auto mode to save money, but since I did that it still seems to be rising at about the same pace.\n\nIs everyone experiencing the same thing? I know my project has gotten rather large but I'm trying to make my queries very focused on one specific issue at a time but each query still seems to cost a decent amount of money.\n\nIs the issue that I simply need to create a new convo because the one I'm in is simply just bleeding cash or is this just the new state of Cursor as a whole?\n\n\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*: Okay I spoke with support and they clarified the issue. Ever since they've allowed indexing a convo, I've kind of just been running the same convo for like a month straight. THIS is absolutely killing my bill. The cached convo tokens are like 5x the usage of every other thing I'm doing.\n\nBasically by maintaining the same convo, I'm causing myself to have exponentially higher costs with every message I send no matter how small it is.\n\nI knew this was how it used to work but I assumed once the indexing process started this was no longer an issue but actually it's a bigger issue than ever because it causes people like my to let convos go on for WAY too long.\n\nThey also let me know that the $200 plan allows for $400 of usage which also made me feel better.\n\nNot to be a huge ass kisser but I was very happy with their very fast response and full explanation of my specific issue so thank you Cursor team!\n\n  \n\\*\\*Edit\\*\\*: [PSA: Indexing Your Conversational Context DOES NOT Index Your Cost! : r/cursor](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1qv5903/psa_indexing_your_conversational_context_does_not/) here I made a different post essentially just saying START A NEW CONVO OR YOUR COSTS WILL BE ASTRONOMICAL OVER TIME lol",

That's crazy... it most definitely changed.\nI never used opus 4.5 BTW cause i know that is super expensive, but I did switched from auto to sonnet 4.5 cause auto was reeeeally stupid now (which is also something that I noticed within this year of usage) auto was not that dumb before( I guess it was using sonnet 4.5?)\n\n\nAnyways, I'm kinda cooked now cause I'm a new dev with only 1 year of experience and I was developing so much with cursor assistance, but since the AI cover the syntax, I could focus on studying and learning about architecture/business logic... there's no way I could develop so much so fast without it to cover the syntax",

Since around September 2025, new subscriptions started being charged, and when you changed your plan, you lost the old free Auto plan, which was supposed to stay free for early subscribers for at least a year.\n\nAuto is just a dynamic LLM selector based on Cursor’s internal decision based on docs and stack  notes. I highly doubt it ever picks top tier models like Opus for serious reasoning. In practice, it seems to jump between models like Grok and GPT pretty quickly. \nSam mentioned that the model should be chosen based on prompt difficulty, but that doesn’t mean it will always pick a strong one.\n\nI wouldn’t call Auto a “dumb agent,” but it’s clearly weaker than using Opus or even Sonnet directly. With a well-specified and correct plan, Auto usually works fine for me. The real difference is this: when Auto generates a plan, I almost always need to tweak and adapt it. When I use Opus, 99.9% of the time the plan is already efficient and usable as-is.\n\nAlso, you don’t need a top model to execute the plan. The smart way is to switch agents by phase: use Opus for planning, then use something like Sonnet to actually implement it, even auto should work fine.",
