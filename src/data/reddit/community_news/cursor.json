The agent calls a tool, gets a response, calls it again, and just keeps going until it burns through your entire budget. It's a known failure mode that really should have a built-in circuit breaker.\n\nTwo things I do now to protect against this:\n\n1. Set the on-demand spend limit to something small, like $10-20 increments. Yes it means you occasionally hit the cap mid-session, but that's infinitely better than waking up to a triple-digit charge.\n\n2. Watch the token counter during agent runs. If you see it climbing fast with the agent repeatedly calling the same tool, kill the session immediately. Don't wait for it to \"figure it out.\"\n\nThe fact that their support blamed your context management is frustrating. A single message generating 241M tokens is clearly not a user error. That's a runaway loop on their infrastructure and they should have detection for that. I'd push back hard on the refund.",

I messaged Cursor support assuming it was a bug.

I couldn't believe it. I responded with a screenshot of the Windsurf installer and nothing else. I haven't looked back since switching. WS pricing model is per request and if you're smart, it's infinite value. We've cut our spend by 80% while increasing use, and we now use better models more liberally.

For most cases, I can kind of sense when Cursor isn't really coming up with an answer and manually stop and retry. It's just how it is.

Never use auto/pro mode for routine tasks. Manually select your model — you'll know exactly what you're paying for.\n\n2. Set a spending limit in your Cursor settings if one exists. If not, check your API dashboard daily.\n\n3. Use .cursorignore aggressively. Every file Cursor indexes is context it might send to the model. node_modules, build artifacts, large data files — exclude everything you don't need.\n\n4. Start fresh conversations frequently. By message 15-20, you're paying for a massive context window on every single request.\n\nThe core issue is that \"auto\" mode optimizes for response quality, not cost. When you let the tool decide everything, you lose visibility into what's happening with your tokens.",

The problem is when it gets stuck in a loop and nothing productive happens yet the cost is run up. The current solution is sitting there watching it all day and monitoring it for potential loops. I’m suggesting an automated cutoff that recognizes when stuck in a loop. I don’t think it’s too far-fetched to think coding this capability within the AI itself or cursor is possible.

      "text": "Cursor 2.5 is another big update! We're excited to announce:\n\n* **Plugins** on the Cursor Marketplace, a new way to extend Cursor with pre-built capabilities. Plugins bundle skills, subagents, MCP servers, hooks, and rules into a single install. Launch partners include Amplitude, AWS, Figma, Linear, Stripe, and more. Browse at [https://cursor.com/marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace) or install directly with `/add-plugin`. Read more on our [blog](https://cursor.com/blog/marketplace)!\n\n* **Sandbox network access controls** that allow you to define exactly which domains the agent can reach while running sandboxed commands. Choose between a strict user allowlist, defaults plus your allowlist, or unrestricted access. Enterprise admins can enforce organization-wide egress policies from the admin dashboard.\n\n* **Subagents can now run asynchronously**, so the parent agent keeps working while subagents run in the background. Subagents can also spawn their own subagents, creating a tree of coordinated work for larger tasks like multi-file features and complex refactors.\n\nLots of other improvements to read about in the [full changelog](https://cursor.com/changelog/2-5)!\n\nWe’d love your feedback on these features. \n\nIf you've found a bug, please post it in [Bug Reports](https://forum.cursor.com/c/support/bug-report/6) so we can track and address it properly, but feel free to drop a link in the relevant discussion thread for visibility.\n",

Right now configuring all of that manually for each project is one of the bigger time sinks.\n\nCurious about the sandbox network controls though.

Should have been a toggle that defaults to off and lets teams decide their own policy. Every team has different feelings about this and forcing it creates unnecessary friction.\n\nThe good news is it's just a setting.

I think cursor quickly figured out that people just want to use the “best” tool, nobody wants to spend the time sorting through the riff raff to figure out which works best - especially for non-devs who wouldn’t know where to start in the first place. They sold themselves as a premium one stop/not tied a specific foundation model provider shop that’s purely incentivized to give you the best tool for your use case . \n\nEnd of day it’s interesting bc I honestly don’t think this is one of those cases where by an incumbent was actually poised to dominate this space like they talk about OpenAI and Microsoft/Google. The positioning of being the decision layer above the models is what was going to determine the winner here regardless and cursor just so happened to be the first to market and almost stumble into the dominant product positioning",

It's if the underlying models get good enough that a simple API call replaces the need for an orchestration layer entirely. Claude Code running in a terminal is already close to that for some workflows.\n\nBut here's what keeps Cursor relevant: most developers don't want to configure agents, manage context windows, or write system prompts. They want to open a project, tab-complete intelligently, and have inline edits that work. That's a product problem, not a model problem.\n\nThe companies that lose in AI tooling are the ones building thin wrappers. Cursor has enough proprietary context management, codebase indexing, and UX polish that switching costs are real. Whether that holds for five years is a different question, but the 'they're just a wrapper' take underestimates the product work involved.",

Claude Max Opus 4.6 and Codex 5.3 High are fantastic models, and they work well in lots of different areas, especially if you have a detailed and well-thought-out plan. \n\nOpus 4.6 is great at both planning and getting things done. It has a more powerful set of tools and is better at handling more areas and making plans clearer, but it does cost a bit more.\n\nCodex had some trouble when I first started using it, but when I provided detailed good plan, it almost matches Opus 4.6 in performance. I’ve found the code is nearly equivalent. However, the model has weaker debugging capabilities. the price is severely discounted making this a very strong contender. \n\nIf you don’t subscribe to the Max Plan, use Opus 4.6 max for planning, and Codex for writing code.",

Cursors sub isnt going too far with sonnet though lately so...\n\nEnded up getting hit with extra usage on both claude and cursor last month,  just needed to get stuff done and fast, blew through weekly limits on claude early, whatever January was busy for me. Think it was 60 to 80 dollars extra across both.\n\nAnyway, decided last week to upgrade claude to the $100 max plan this month, well fml, for my purposes its basically unlimited opus on tap. I'm still in the first week but I actually can't push it far enough to use up the weekly limit,  I'm only at 30% weekly limit and my 'goal' was to be at 60% to make sure I get the value of it and leave nothing in the table. I'm blown away, I've been working flat out with it all week. I have github actions running pr reviews constantly, 2 or 3 agents on the go working to create pr's.\n\nBeen thinking today how I'm going to step it up another level but yeah... I dont know what my point is exactly but yeah extra usage on cursor is starting to look like terrible value, I would have had single prompts cost me a few dollars to try and get out of a hole when a $100 monthly plan straight from claude has 5 hourly and WEEKLY limits that I can't get even close to hitting and I'm pushing as hard as I can.\n\nLong may it last, don't know if I can financially justify my new $100 a month crack habit but we will see. I see people talking about having two $20 a month plans, perhaps that is the sweet spot but I always felt using opus on the $20 plan ate the weekly limit. This just feels bottomless.",

The MacOS memory warning will include all child processes of applications when calculating the memory usage, so it can lead to surprising numbers such as this, as it will include extensions such as language servers. The Cursor app memory usage in activity monitor at the same time is often much lower, as are the metrics that tools like `top` will report.\n\n  \nYou can use the `Process Explorer` tool in the Cursor app to get more insight into what's taking up so much memory. This saves a 24 hour history of Cursor's memory and CPU usage locally broken down by process, see [this guide](https://cursorai.notion.site/Troubleshooting-Cursor-Performance-286da74ef04580cfbe24fada4c96481c#2aada74ef04580c2bb70e7cda4c2fd85) for how to use it. If you send me the memory usage history from this tool, I can take a look with the team to see if there are any surprises.",

For example, it hit 6GB yesterday in a spike where the total memory hit 11GB.\n\n  \nAs you point out in another post in this discussion, there are also 4 renderer processes. Each represents a Cursor window. We are working all the time on improving the efficiency of individual windows, but this may be contributing to the MacOS memory warning.",

          "text": "The cost increase is real, but it's mostly about how you use the tool rather than the tool itself getting greedy.\n\nA few things that cut my token usage significantly: First, be specific with your prompts. \"Fix the bug\" burns way more tokens than \"The login function on line 42 returns null when the email contains a plus sign.\" The more context you give upfront, the less the agent has to explore.\n\nSecond, avoid Auto mode for simple tasks. If you just need a quick edit, use a cheaper model manually. Save the heavy models for complex refactoring where they actually earn their cost.\n\nThird, keep your codebase organized. If the agent has to read through thousands of lines of spaghetti to understand your project, that's all token usage. Good file structure and clear naming saves money in a very literal sense.\n\nI use Cursor daily and my monthly spend has stayed pretty consistent even as models have gotten more expensive, mainly because I've gotten better at knowing when to use the big guns versus when a simpler approach works.",

The latency difference is significant when you're in flow.\n\nQuality-wise, it handles single-file edits and refactors really well. For straightforward tasks (writing tests, implementing a function from a clear spec, fixing bugs), I'd say it's 95% as good as Opus. The gap shows up in multi-file architectural decisions where Opus still thinks more carefully about dependencies.\n\nThe pricing comparison with Codex 5.3 is interesting. The person mentioning Codex is cheaper isn't wrong, but \"cheaper\" and \"better value\" aren't always the same thing. What matters is cost per successful task completion, not cost per token. If a model gets it right on the first try instead of needing 3 back-and-forths, the \"expensive\" model can end up cheaper in practice.\n\nFor the $20 plan specifically: Sonnet 4.6 as your default + Opus 4.6 for complex tasks is probably the best balance right now. You'll get way more requests out of your budget compared to running Opus for everything.",

Cursor's context management is genuinely better — it's more selective about what it sends to the model, which means less token waste and more relevant responses.\n\nClaude Code sends a lot of context by default, which is great for deep understanding but terrible for cost and limits. The compacting behavior you noticed is because it's hitting context window limits and has to summarize everything.\n\nOne thing that helps with any tool: explicitly tell it which files matter. Instead of letting it discover your codebase, reference specific files and line numbers in your prompt. The more precise your prompt, the less irrelevant context gets sent.\n\nAlso worth noting — Opus is significantly more expensive per token than Sonnet. If you're doing routine coding work, Sonnet 4.5 gives you 80% of the quality at maybe 20% of the cost.",

Custom rules? Yeah. Subagents? Kinda yeah, named subtasks. Sadly they don‘t support parallel/async subtasks (yet). Want to customise the compaction logics prompt? Yes.\n\nAnd it‘s an VSC Extension, so you can use it easily, just add github copilot to it as a profile (it‘s natively supported).\n\n(I am not affiliated with RooCode, even if it sounds like it lol, I just loved their product)",

          "text": "Honestly, I’d say stop fighting your security team and take the time to really learn Copilot. It’s way closer to Cursor than people realize, and it’s not the massive step back you think it is.\n\nHere is why:\n\n* **The workflow is basically the same:** Copilot’s chat window now has Plan, Ask, and Agent modes. Sound familiar?\n* **Model selection:** Just like Cursor, it lets you pick the specific model you want to use for each request.\n* **Better PR integration:** You can use \"Fix using AI\" when reviewing code comments and it legitimately works. You can't natively do that in Cursor.\n* **The \"Fork\" Problem:** Cursor isn't just an extension; it's a custom fork of VS Code. That means your InfoSec team has to vet and approve an entirely separate IDE. Plus, some proprietary Microsoft extensions (like specific C# debuggers or Azure integrations) can run into licensing or compatibility issues on Cursor. Copilot is just a vetted extension running inside the standard VS Code environment they already trust.\n* **The Enterprise Paper Trail:** If your company uses Copilot Business or Enterprise, GitHub provides explicit, enterprise-grade legal guarantees that your codebase is **never** used to train their models. Pointing your security team to those specific data privacy policies is usually the silver bullet they need to sign off.\n\nAt the end of the day, VS Code with Copilot is getting shockingly close to feature parity because they both just rely on the same underlying models anyway. The difference is Microsoft and GitHub actually have the enterprise trust and regulatory due diligence to give a company real peace of mind.\n\nCursor is awesome, but Copilot gets the job done without giving your InfoSec team a heart attack. Just lean into it.",

Some companies are uncomfortable with the idea that their proprietary code could potentially be exposed through an LLM provider’s API. I think that concern is legitimate.\n\nIn many cases, companies address this by signing contracts with LLM providers and using dedicated enterprise endpoints or API keys that explicitly guarantee that their code will not be used for training.\n\nIf the restriction is based on that kind of security or legal reasoning, I think it’s justified, and as an employee, it makes sense to follow that decision.\n\nHowever, if there’s no explanation and it’s more of a “You just can’t use Cursor” type of ban, then it might be worth discussing whether the restriction can be relaxed to something like the first case.",

Ask specifically what their objections are. \"AI tool security\" is vague. Is it data residency? SOC 2? Code leaving the network? Each has a different solution.\n\n2. Cursor's Privacy Mode + their SOC 2 Type II certification addresses most enterprise concerns. Your code doesn't get stored or used for training in privacy mode. Get the actual docs from their security page and bring them to your security team with specific answers to their specific concerns.\n\n3. If they still say no, Copilot with Opus 4.6 or Codex 5.3 is honestly decent now. It's not the same workflow as Cursor's composer, but the gap is narrowing. The agent mode in Copilot has improved significantly.\n\n4. Another option your security team might accept: run models locally via Ollama + Continue.dev extension. No code leaves your machine. Quality isn't as good as cloud models, but some companies accept this as a compromise.\n\nThe reality is most companies will eventually standardize on AI coding tools, but security teams need to go through their process. Fighting them just makes you look like you're prioritizing convenience over security, which hurts your credibility internally.",

But I recently hit a massive wall on a more complex app that almost made me quit the whole thing.\n\nI ask the AI to add a feature, it fixes one thing but breaks three others. I tell it to fix the bugs, and it starts gaslighting me, saying the code is correct when it clearly isn't. This usually happens because the context window gets messy and the AI loses the context.\n\nI’ve spent the last month refining a workflow that actually works for multi-file, complex systems. It’s a 3-step loop that moves the thinking out of the IDE:\n\n  \nInstead of just direct prompts, I started using traycer as an architect layer first. I dump my ideas into it just to get a solid technical blueprint and spec.\n\nOnce I have that verified spec, then I hand it over to Claude or Cursor. Because the AI has a strict map to follow now, it stops guessing. Hallucinations drop to basically zero because I’m not asking it to design and build simultaneously just execute.\n\nAfter it spits out the code, I run it back through Traycer just to cross-check it against the original plan. It catches those sneaky logic drifts.\n\nJust sharing what finally worked for me. Curious to hear how you guys are managing context drift in larger AI-assisted projects?",

The AI becomes dramatically more reliable when it has constraints to work within rather than open-ended freedom.\n\nThe other thing that kills the gaslighting loop is keeping files small. Once a single file crosses ~300 lines, context quality drops off a cliff. We enforce strict separation of concerns partly for good engineering, partly because it keeps the AI accurate.\n\nCurious what your spec documents typically look like.

I’m curious though - when you say Traycer “verifies”, what does that look like in practice? Like: is it checking invariants/acceptance criteria, generating tests, diff constraints, or just an LLM cross-check against the spec?

But the differences show up in what each one decided to add on its own.\n\n**Opus** noticed my JWT tokens had no expiry, added `expiresIn: '24h'`, threw in a `.gitignore`, and quietly changed a 400 status code to 401 for invalid tokens. I didn't ask for any of that.\n\n**Sonnet** caught the JWT expiry too but made it configurable through an env var. Also added a `/health` endpoint, a README, and `express.urlencoded()`. More of an ops angle.\n\n**GPT** went way further than I expected. Built a custom `HttpError` class, an `asyncHandler` wrapper for async routes, and split `app.js` from `server.js` for testability. The asyncHandler is actually useful since Express doesn't catch async errors on its own.\n\n**Gemini** did exactly what I asked and nothing more. The output was clean but there were no surprises. Also the slowest at 4+ minutes.\n\n**Auto** produced output that overlapped with multiple models. Some patterns matched Opus (JWT expiry, 401 fix), others looked more like GPT (app/server split). I can't determine which model it actually routed to.\n\n**Timing:**\n- Sonnet: ~60s\n- GPT: ~1m 21s\n- Opus: ~2m\n- Gemini: ~4m 21s\n\nI've been defaulting to Sonnet for most things since this. It's fast and it adds stuff I'd actually want. Opus when I care about security. GPT if I want it to go overboard on architecture.\n\nAnyway, worth actually looking at the diffs instead of just accepting the first output. Some of the \"extras\" were things I should've asked for in the first place.\n\n(all tested in Cursor CLI agent mode, Pro plan)\n\n**Edit:** Fixed the Auto mode section. I originally said it picked Opus but looking at the output patterns more carefully, they overlap with multiple models. I was inferring from similarities and stated it too confidently.",

      "text": "Ok so I've been building a full-stack app (React + Express + Supabase + some AI stuff) and my cursor rules situation was a mess for months. Started with one big `.cursorrules` file, kept adding to it, and eventually realized Cursor was just... ignoring most of it.\n\nTook me a while to figure out why, but it clicked when I started thinking about it in terms of tokens. Every rule you load eats context window. Context window is literally all Cursor can \"think about\" at once. So stuffing 2000 lines of rules into always-on files is like handing someone a manual and asking them to keep the whole thing in their head while writing code. Of course it drops stuff.\n\nSo I rebuilt my whole rules setup around one question: what does Cursor actually need to know *right now* for *this specific task*?\n\n# What I landed on (the 2-4-2 thing)\n\n8 files, three tiers. Not because 8 is magic but because thats what my project needed.\n\n**2 always-on files.** These load on every conversation so they have to be short. Like, under 200 lines each, ideally shorter.\n\nFirst one is basically project context. If a new developer joined tomorrow, what would they need to know before touching anything? The tech stack, folder structure, where important files live, and the handful of rules that are never ok to break. For me those are things like language/direction requirements, brand colors, and some domain-specific stuff. This file answers \"what are we even building.\"\n\nSecond one is code standards. Naming conventions, file size limits, how we handle errors, TypeScript rules, that kind of thing. Stuff that applies no matter what part of the codebase you're in. This answers \"what does good code look like here.\"\n\nThats it for always-on. Everything else is conditional.\n\n**4 auto-attached files** that activate based on file globs. Each one covers a \"zone\" of the codebase:\n\n* Frontend (`client/src/**`): component library, design system, data fetching patterns, i18n/RTL stuff\n* Backend (`server/routes.ts`, etc): API patterns, middleware, reponse formats, auth per role\n* Database (`server/supabase.ts`, `shared/schema.ts`): query patterns, RLS, schema conventions\n* AI/ML (various AI files): model integration, prompt standards, how to handle when AI returns garbage\n\nThese only load when you're actually editing files that match the globs. So if I'm working on a React component, Cursor gets the frontend rules but doesn't waste context on database query patterns. These can be longer since they're not always loaded, mine are like 150-300 lines.\n\nThe zone split will be different for every project obviously. A Next.js app probably needs fewer. The principle is just: group by domain, not by file type.\n\n**2 agent-requested files.** These are the ones people sleep on. Cursor reads the description you write and decides on its own whether to pull them in.\n\nI have one for security (auth flows, token handling, access control, env variables) and one thats basically a new feature checklist. The checklist one is great because when Cursor is building something end to end it reminds itself to think about database migrations, route guards, loading states, cache invalidation, all the stuff you forget at 2am.\n\nThe security one alone has caught so many missing auth middleware situations. Worth the setup time just for that.\n\n# Why bother with all this\n\nHonestly the main reason is Cursor actually listens to shorter focused files. I don't have data to back this up but after months of using both approaches, the difference is night and day. With one giant file it would follow maybe 60% of my conventions. With this setup its closer to 90%.\n\nAlso maintanence. Updating one focused file when your API patterns change is easy. Hunting through a 1500 line mega-file to find the relevant section and hoping you dont break some other rule in the process... not fun.\n\nAnd you stop getting those wierd situations where rules contradict each other because you wrote one section in January and another in March and forgot about the first one.\n\n# Things I learned the hard way\n\nYour rules should describe *how* to build, not *what* to build. Patterns and conventions, not feature specs. \"Every route must validate input and return errors\" is a good rule. \"The login page should have a forgot password link\" is not.\n\nTell Cursor what NOT to do. Seriously. My frontend rules explicitly list libraries it shouldn't install because it kept trying to add axios when we already have fetch, or moment when we have date-fns. Saved me a lot of cleanup.\n\nUse real file paths in your rules. Don't say \"follow the established pattern.\" Say \"follow the patterns in `client/src/hooks/useDataCache.ts`.\" Cursor can actually go read that file then. Game changer.\n\nBe absolutely ruthless about what goes in always-on files. Every single line in those files gets processed on every single message. If something only matters when you're touching the database, it goes in the database file, period.\n\nFor the agent-requested files, the description field is everything. Write it like you're telling a coworker when they should grab this binder off the shelf. \"Security patterns, auth flows, token handling, RLS policies\" works way better than just \"security stuff.\"\n\nAnd review your rules regularly. Stale rules are genuinely worse than no rules because Cursor will confidently follow patterns your codebase has moved on from. I try to look at mine every couple weeks, takes like 20 minutes.\n\n# TLDR\n\nStop putting everything in one file. Split your rules into tiers based on when Cursor actually needs them: always-on (keep tiny), auto-attached by file globs (bulk of your rules), and agent-requested for cross-cutting stuff. The specific number of files doesn't matter, the tiering principle does.\n\nHappy to answer questions. Curious how others are handling this too.\n\n\n\n*Edit: this is for the* `.cursor/rules/` *system with* `.mdc` *files, not the old single* `.cursorrules` *file. If you haven't migrated yet the glob-based auto-attach alone makes it worth it.*",

Two small always-on files for coding standards and project structure, then task-specific files that only load when relevant. The biggest improvement came from being ruthless about what counts as \"always-on.\" If a rule only applies to one part of the codebase, it doesn't belong in the global file.\n\nOne thing I'd add: keep your rules files versioned and review them monthly. As your codebase evolves, rules that were critical three months ago might be irrelevant now. Dead rules are worse than no rules because they dilute the ones that actually matter.",

If I code 20-30 hours/month, it's \\~$15-30 vs $50-70 across multiple subscriptions.Using DeepSeek V3 through an API wrapper. Quality is close to Claude for most coding tasks, not perfect but good enough.Main benefit is unlimited usage - no more hitting limits mid-project.Still early/experimental though. Interested to hear if others have tried similar setups.\n\n",
