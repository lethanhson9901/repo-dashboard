The agent calls a tool, gets a response, calls it again, and just keeps going until it burns through your entire budget. It's a known failure mode that really should have a built-in circuit breaker.\n\nTwo things I do now to protect against this:\n\n1. Set the on-demand spend limit to something small, like $10-20 increments. Yes it means you occasionally hit the cap mid-session, but that's infinitely better than waking up to a triple-digit charge.\n\n2. Watch the token counter during agent runs. If you see it climbing fast with the agent repeatedly calling the same tool, kill the session immediately. Don't wait for it to \"figure it out.\"\n\nThe fact that their support blamed your context management is frustrating. A single message generating 241M tokens is clearly not a user error. That's a runaway loop on their infrastructure and they should have detection for that. I'd push back hard on the refund.",

I messaged Cursor support assuming it was a bug.

I couldn't believe it. I responded with a screenshot of the Windsurf installer and nothing else. I haven't looked back since switching. WS pricing model is per request and if you're smart, it's infinite value. We've cut our spend by 80% while increasing use, and we now use better models more liberally.

For most cases, I can kind of sense when Cursor isn't really coming up with an answer and manually stop and retry. It's just how it is.

Never use auto/pro mode for routine tasks. Manually select your model — you'll know exactly what you're paying for.\n\n2. Set a spending limit in your Cursor settings if one exists. If not, check your API dashboard daily.\n\n3. Use .cursorignore aggressively. Every file Cursor indexes is context it might send to the model. node_modules, build artifacts, large data files — exclude everything you don't need.\n\n4. Start fresh conversations frequently. By message 15-20, you're paying for a massive context window on every single request.\n\nThe core issue is that \"auto\" mode optimizes for response quality, not cost. When you let the tool decide everything, you lose visibility into what's happening with your tokens.",

The problem is when it gets stuck in a loop and nothing productive happens yet the cost is run up. The current solution is sitting there watching it all day and monitoring it for potential loops. I’m suggesting an automated cutoff that recognizes when stuck in a loop. I don’t think it’s too far-fetched to think coding this capability within the AI itself or cursor is possible.

The token explosion you mentioned is likely due to an infinite or recursive context loop, which Cursor currently doesn't safeguard well against. It's frustrating that support isn't promptly acknowledging the issue, especially when it's potentially caused by the system AI rather than user error. For now, I'd recommend keeping a manual log of conversation timestamps and snapshots, if only to create your own audit trail - it's a pain, but it helps in disputes. Hopefully more people flag this so they take it seriously.",

Plugins bundle skills, subagents, MCP servers, hooks, and rules into a single install. Launch partners include Amplitude, AWS, Figma, Linear, Stripe, and more. Browse at [https://cursor.com/marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace) or install directly with `/add-plugin`. Read more on our [blog](https://cursor.com/blog/marketplace)!\n\n* **Sandbox network access controls** that allow you to define exactly which domains the agent can reach while running sandboxed commands. Choose between a strict user allowlist, defaults plus your allowlist, or unrestricted access. Enterprise admins can enforce organization-wide egress policies from the admin dashboard.\n\n* **Subagents can now run asynchronously**, so the parent agent keeps working while subagents run in the background. Subagents can also spawn their own subagents, creating a tree of coordinated work for larger tasks like multi-file features and complex refactors.\n\nLots of other improvements to read about in the [full changelog](https://cursor.com/changelog/2-5)!\n\nWe’d love your feedback on these features. \n\nIf you've found a bug, please post it in [Bug Reports](https://forum.cursor.com/c/support/bug-report/6) so we can track and address it properly, but feel free to drop a link in the relevant discussion thread for visibility.\n",

Should have been a toggle that defaults to off and lets teams decide their own policy. Every team has different feelings about this and forcing it creates unnecessary friction.\n\nThe good news is it's just a setting.

At $0.60 per million input tokens with 83% cached savings, you can use this as your default model for routine tasks and save the heavier models for complex architecture decisions or tricky debugging.\n\nI have been running a similar strategy with my coding workflow. Cheaper models handle boilerplate, scaffolding, and straightforward refactors. Then I switch to Opus or o3 when I need something that actually reasons through multi-file dependencies or subtle edge cases. The cost difference adds up fast when you are doing 50+ interactions a day.\n\nCurious how K2.5 handles large context windows in practice. The benchmarks look solid but real-world performance with big codebases is where these models tend to diverge from their paper scores.",

And tbh, I never even considered there would be different rules for chargebacks on a international level. TIL\n\nEDIT:\n\nI did a little bit of looking into this because it intrigued me, and while you're not wrong per se, it's not entirely accurate either.  \n\nPeople of Japan can do chargebacks, it appears to be more cultural than for legal reasons though.  And while perhaps there are some obscure banks, majority of the world doing international online transactions would have access to chargebacks.  \n\nCursor is bound by the laws of the United States, and even stronger California.  This immediate upsell charge experience is not legal in California.  \n\nAnd the final point, Cursor uses stripe for every payment option internationally.  Conclusion, it's a 99% bet OP and anyone else can request a chargeback and likely win.  On one hand it was a fun journey to refresh my knowledge on this, on the other hand try being less pedantic?",

The MacOS memory warning will include all child processes of applications when calculating the memory usage, so it can lead to surprising numbers such as this, as it will include extensions such as language servers. The Cursor app memory usage in activity monitor at the same time is often much lower, as are the metrics that tools like `top` will report.\n\n  \nYou can use the `Process Explorer` tool in the Cursor app to get more insight into what's taking up so much memory. This saves a 24 hour history of Cursor's memory and CPU usage locally broken down by process, see [this guide](https://cursorai.notion.site/Troubleshooting-Cursor-Performance-286da74ef04580cfbe24fada4c96481c#2aada74ef04580c2bb70e7cda4c2fd85) for how to use it. If you send me the memory usage history from this tool, I can take a look with the team to see if there are any surprises.",

I’ve been enjoying the Ultra, but definitely not worth the price.\n\nI noticed a button that claimed 20% off the monthly plan if you switch to annual billing. I wanted to learn more, so I clicked on it. To my surprise, I was immediately charged \\~$1,900 without being presented with any confirmation page or billing amount.\n\nI immediately reached out to support to get my subscription reversed back to monthly, but they refused, citing a policy that prevents any changes once included usage is recorded. I had only made a couple prompts on the annual plan, which I didn’t think would be an issue since Cursor has very comprehensive logging of usage and refunding unused time should be straightforward.\n\nNow I’m stuck with a 12 month Ultra subscription that I never intended to commit to.\n\nHas anyone else run into this? Were you able to get it reversed or refunded?",

If you just need a quick edit, use a cheaper model manually. Save the heavy models for complex refactoring where they actually earn their cost.\n\nThird, keep your codebase organized. If the agent has to read through thousands of lines of spaghetti to understand your project, that's all token usage. Good file structure and clear naming saves money in a very literal sense.\n\nI use Cursor daily and my monthly spend has stayed pretty consistent even as models have gotten more expensive, mainly because I've gotten better at knowing when to use the big guns versus when a simpler approach works.",

Quick observations:\n\nSpeed is noticeably faster than Opus 4.6, which matters a lot in a coding workflow where you're going back and forth quickly. The latency difference is significant when you're in flow.\n\nQuality-wise, it handles single-file edits and refactors really well. For straightforward tasks (writing tests, implementing a function from a clear spec, fixing bugs), I'd say it's 95% as good as Opus. The gap shows up in multi-file architectural decisions where Opus still thinks more carefully about dependencies.\n\nThe pricing comparison with Codex 5.3 is interesting. The person mentioning Codex is cheaper isn't wrong, but \"cheaper\" and \"better value\" aren't always the same thing. What matters is cost per successful task completion, not cost per token. If a model gets it right on the first try instead of needing 3 back-and-forths, the \"expensive\" model can end up cheaper in practice.\n\nFor the $20 plan specifically: Sonnet 4.6 as your default + Opus 4.6 for complex tasks is probably the best balance right now. You'll get way more requests out of your budget compared to running Opus for everything.",

Cursor's context management is genuinely better — it's more selective about what it sends to the model, which means less token waste and more relevant responses.\n\nClaude Code sends a lot of context by default, which is great for deep understanding but terrible for cost and limits. The compacting behavior you noticed is because it's hitting context window limits and has to summarize everything.\n\nOne thing that helps with any tool: explicitly tell it which files matter. Instead of letting it discover your codebase, reference specific files and line numbers in your prompt. The more precise your prompt, the less irrelevant context gets sent.\n\nAlso worth noting — Opus is significantly more expensive per token than Sonnet. If you're doing routine coding work, Sonnet 4.5 gives you 80% of the quality at maybe 20% of the cost.",

          "text": "Honestly, I’d say stop fighting your security team and take the time to really learn Copilot. It’s way closer to Cursor than people realize, and it’s not the massive step back you think it is.\n\nHere is why:\n\n* **The workflow is basically the same:** Copilot’s chat window now has Plan, Ask, and Agent modes. Sound familiar?\n* **Model selection:** Just like Cursor, it lets you pick the specific model you want to use for each request.\n* **Better PR integration:** You can use \"Fix using AI\" when reviewing code comments and it legitimately works. You can't natively do that in Cursor.\n* **The \"Fork\" Problem:** Cursor isn't just an extension; it's a custom fork of VS Code. That means your InfoSec team has to vet and approve an entirely separate IDE. Plus, some proprietary Microsoft extensions (like specific C# debuggers or Azure integrations) can run into licensing or compatibility issues on Cursor. Copilot is just a vetted extension running inside the standard VS Code environment they already trust.\n* **The Enterprise Paper Trail:** If your company uses Copilot Business or Enterprise, GitHub provides explicit, enterprise-grade legal guarantees that your codebase is **never** used to train their models. Pointing your security team to those specific data privacy policies is usually the silver bullet they need to sign off.\n\nAt the end of the day, VS Code with Copilot is getting shockingly close to feature parity because they both just rely on the same underlying models anyway. The difference is Microsoft and GitHub actually have the enterprise trust and regulatory due diligence to give a company real peace of mind.\n\nCursor is awesome, but Copilot gets the job done without giving your InfoSec team a heart attack. Just lean into it.",

Some companies are uncomfortable with the idea that their proprietary code could potentially be exposed through an LLM provider’s API. I think that concern is legitimate.\n\nIn many cases, companies address this by signing contracts with LLM providers and using dedicated enterprise endpoints or API keys that explicitly guarantee that their code will not be used for training.\n\nIf the restriction is based on that kind of security or legal reasoning, I think it’s justified, and as an employee, it makes sense to follow that decision.\n\nHowever, if there’s no explanation and it’s more of a “You just can’t use Cursor” type of ban, then it might be worth discussing whether the restriction can be relaxed to something like the first case.",

Ask specifically what their objections are. \"AI tool security\" is vague. Is it data residency? SOC 2? Code leaving the network? Each has a different solution.\n\n2. Cursor's Privacy Mode + their SOC 2 Type II certification addresses most enterprise concerns. Your code doesn't get stored or used for training in privacy mode. Get the actual docs from their security page and bring them to your security team with specific answers to their specific concerns.\n\n3. If they still say no, Copilot with Opus 4.6 or Codex 5.3 is honestly decent now. It's not the same workflow as Cursor's composer, but the gap is narrowing. The agent mode in Copilot has improved significantly.\n\n4. Another option your security team might accept: run models locally via Ollama + Continue.dev extension. No code leaves your machine. Quality isn't as good as cloud models, but some companies accept this as a compromise.\n\nThe reality is most companies will eventually standardize on AI coding tools, but security teams need to go through their process. Fighting them just makes you look like you're prioritizing convenience over security, which hurts your credibility internally.",

      "text": "Ok so I've been building a full-stack app (React + Express + Supabase + some AI stuff) and my cursor rules situation was a mess for months. Started with one big `.cursorrules` file, kept adding to it, and eventually realized Cursor was just... ignoring most of it.\n\nTook me a while to figure out why, but it clicked when I started thinking about it in terms of tokens. Every rule you load eats context window. Context window is literally all Cursor can \"think about\" at once. So stuffing 2000 lines of rules into always-on files is like handing someone a manual and asking them to keep the whole thing in their head while writing code. Of course it drops stuff.\n\nSo I rebuilt my whole rules setup around one question: what does Cursor actually need to know *right now* for *this specific task*?\n\n# What I landed on (the 2-4-2 thing)\n\n8 files, three tiers. Not because 8 is magic but because thats what my project needed.\n\n**2 always-on files.** These load on every conversation so they have to be short. Like, under 200 lines each, ideally shorter.\n\nFirst one is basically project context. If a new developer joined tomorrow, what would they need to know before touching anything? The tech stack, folder structure, where important files live, and the handful of rules that are never ok to break. For me those are things like language/direction requirements, brand colors, and some domain-specific stuff. This file answers \"what are we even building.\"\n\nSecond one is code standards. Naming conventions, file size limits, how we handle errors, TypeScript rules, that kind of thing. Stuff that applies no matter what part of the codebase you're in. This answers \"what does good code look like here.\"\n\nThats it for always-on. Everything else is conditional.\n\n**4 auto-attached files** that activate based on file globs. Each one covers a \"zone\" of the codebase:\n\n* Frontend (`client/src/**`): component library, design system, data fetching patterns, i18n/RTL stuff\n* Backend (`server/routes.ts`, etc): API patterns, middleware, reponse formats, auth per role\n* Database (`server/supabase.ts`, `shared/schema.ts`): query patterns, RLS, schema conventions\n* AI/ML (various AI files): model integration, prompt standards, how to handle when AI returns garbage\n\nThese only load when you're actually editing files that match the globs. So if I'm working on a React component, Cursor gets the frontend rules but doesn't waste context on database query patterns. These can be longer since they're not always loaded, mine are like 150-300 lines.\n\nThe zone split will be different for every project obviously. A Next.js app probably needs fewer. The principle is just: group by domain, not by file type.\n\n**2 agent-requested files.** These are the ones people sleep on. Cursor reads the description you write and decides on its own whether to pull them in.\n\nI have one for security (auth flows, token handling, access control, env variables) and one thats basically a new feature checklist. The checklist one is great because when Cursor is building something end to end it reminds itself to think about database migrations, route guards, loading states, cache invalidation, all the stuff you forget at 2am.\n\nThe security one alone has caught so many missing auth middleware situations. Worth the setup time just for that.\n\n# Why bother with all this\n\nHonestly the main reason is Cursor actually listens to shorter focused files. I don't have data to back this up but after months of using both approaches, the difference is night and day. With one giant file it would follow maybe 60% of my conventions. With this setup its closer to 90%.\n\nAlso maintanence. Updating one focused file when your API patterns change is easy. Hunting through a 1500 line mega-file to find the relevant section and hoping you dont break some other rule in the process... not fun.\n\nAnd you stop getting those wierd situations where rules contradict each other because you wrote one section in January and another in March and forgot about the first one.\n\n# Things I learned the hard way\n\nYour rules should describe *how* to build, not *what* to build. Patterns and conventions, not feature specs. \"Every route must validate input and return errors\" is a good rule. \"The login page should have a forgot password link\" is not.\n\nTell Cursor what NOT to do. Seriously. My frontend rules explicitly list libraries it shouldn't install because it kept trying to add axios when we already have fetch, or moment when we have date-fns. Saved me a lot of cleanup.\n\nUse real file paths in your rules. Don't say \"follow the established pattern.\" Say \"follow the patterns in `client/src/hooks/useDataCache.ts`.\" Cursor can actually go read that file then. Game changer.\n\nBe absolutely ruthless about what goes in always-on files. Every single line in those files gets processed on every single message. If something only matters when you're touching the database, it goes in the database file, period.\n\nFor the agent-requested files, the description field is everything. Write it like you're telling a coworker when they should grab this binder off the shelf. \"Security patterns, auth flows, token handling, RLS policies\" works way better than just \"security stuff.\"\n\nAnd review your rules regularly. Stale rules are genuinely worse than no rules because Cursor will confidently follow patterns your codebase has moved on from. I try to look at mine every couple weeks, takes like 20 minutes.\n\n# TLDR\n\nStop putting everything in one file. Split your rules into tiers based on when Cursor actually needs them: always-on (keep tiny), auto-attached by file globs (bulk of your rules), and agent-requested for cross-cutting stuff. The specific number of files doesn't matter, the tiering principle does.\n\nHappy to answer questions. Curious how others are handling this too.\n\n\n\n*Edit: this is for the* `.cursor/rules/` *system with* `.mdc` *files, not the old single* `.cursorrules` *file. If you haven't migrated yet the glob-based auto-attach alone makes it worth it.*",

Two small always-on files for coding standards and project structure, then task-specific files that only load when relevant. The biggest improvement came from being ruthless about what counts as \"always-on.\" If a rule only applies to one part of the codebase, it doesn't belong in the global file.\n\nOne thing I'd add: keep your rules files versioned and review them monthly. As your codebase evolves, rules that were critical three months ago might be irrelevant now. Dead rules are worse than no rules because they dilute the ones that actually matter.",

The 25-item Limit for transact_write_items is a hard AWS service quota - not configurable.

So I took Cursor and ran same prompt through 7 models - Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT 5.2, GPT 5.2 Thinking Extra High, Sonnet, Opus 4.5 and Opus 4.6.   \nI simply applied auto-accept mode and waited for the model to finish the task  \n  \n1. First prompt was to exactly replicate the website by provided link  \nGPT5.2 was the only one who matched the style, others implemented their own versions (completely different colors, fonts, style).   \nGemini did very light job and replicated only main page, others tried to replicate referenced pages.  \n  \n2. Reddit scraper to find business ideas   \nI asked to build a website which scrapes reddit API to find buisness ideas for specified subreddits. For ideas analyses I told to use OpenAI api.  \nActually every model delivered something workable, GPT and both Opus were the best imo, they produced interesting clustering graph visualisation.  \n  \n3. Desktop app for video dubbing, only local LLMs allowed  \nGemini completely failed, nothing worked. Others delivered half workable results, but for GPT and Opus at least it looked like a solid desktop app.  \n  \nFinal observations:  \nSurprisingly, I didn't notice any difference between Gemini 3Flash and 3Pro, they both delivered simple low quality results, but fast and for cheap.  \nGPT: took 30-60 min for every task to finish, always one of the highest quality, moderately expensive. Have not noticed any difference between GPT 5.2 and 5.2 Thinking Extra High  \nOpus: 4.6 tends to do less mistakes than 4.5, but overall produces very similar results. Both Opus are the most expensive from the list. For some exercises it was worth it, for some dont  \nSonnet: Tends to do smth simple, but workable  \n  \nThe conclusions I made for myself:   \nGemini models are OK if you know what you want to build exactly and can provide the model good precise instructions.  \nSonnet is very good for average complexity tasks.  \nFor complex task, research, unclear problem I would prefer using Opus or GPT  \n  \nIf anyone’s interested, I recorded a video with full side-by-side comparison with all outputs",

They may be assigned against a specific LLM model (Opus for example) and end up working out that a specific design element needs greater granularity for the subordinate agents to build to as spec’d. Also just creates cognitive clarity for me. I’ve been lost in it too many times before.",

          "text": "Interesting test. One thing I have noticed running similar comparisons across our team: the model ranking changes dramatically depending on codebase size and complexity. For greenfield single-file tasks, most models perform similarly. But once you are working in a project with 50+ files and established patterns, the gap between models that actually read context and models that just generate plausible code becomes massive.\n\nOpus 4.6 has been our go-to for anything that requires understanding existing architecture before making changes. For rapid prototyping and vibe coding from scratch, GPT 5.2 is hard to beat on speed and style matching.\n\nThe real unlock we found was using different models for different stages: a fast model for scaffolding and boilerplate, then a reasoning model for the tricky integration and debugging work. Trying to use one model for everything is like using a hammer for every job.",

Use .cursorignore to exclude node_modules, build folders, dist, .next, and anything else you don't need in context. This alone can cut token usage by 40-50%.\n\n2. Start fresh conversations for each task. Context accumulates with every message, and by message 10 you're paying for all the previous context every single time.\n\n3. Switch to manual model selection instead of Auto. Pick the model yourself — you'll have more control over what's happening under the hood.\n\nThe hidden cost killer is context size, not model price.
