When I'm implementing something using cursor, I switch it from Agent to Tutorial mode.\n\nI know, there is no tutorial mode. But you can set up a command for this quite easily!\n\nHere is what I do:\n\n1. I start a new chat agent\n2. I switch to \"plan\" mode and usually use Claude 4.5 sonnet\n3. I write as much detail as I can about the problem I want to solve, the bug I'm fixing, or the feature I'm implementing. And I feed the prompt a few files or sections of code when relevant.\n4. I let it plan out the solution\n5. Then I switch to \"plan\" mode (and usually a lower cost model like Gemini 3 Flash) and add my \\`tutorial\\` command to the prompt\n\nThen instead of the agent changing numerous files and fixing the issue without a lot of intervention, it prompts me to fix it step by step. I create the new files, I copy and paste the new code (sometime I even type it myself). And gradually I implement the new feature.\n\nI find this process to be much more satisfying. I have a much better model of what is happening in my app. And I can interrupt the tutorial at any time by asking questions, suggesting changes, discovering flaws in the plan right when they present themselves.\n\nHere is my current version of the plan. Personally, I enjoy using TDD, and so I have my tutorials follow that pattern. \n\n    # tutorial\n    \n    Let's switch into tutorial mode, where you walk me through the steps, one at a time. I make all the changes.\n    \n    Whenever possible, we should write a test first. Let's not wait for the tests to be made at the end. For instance, let's add breaking tests first, before we implement the code. Again, DON'T make the changes. Instead, walk ME through the steps, one at a time and have me write the tests and the code.\n    \n    Make the steps incremental, one block of code, function or component at a time, I should not be adding an entire file longer than 50 lines all at once.\n\nPlease note, you may want another command like \"/end-tutorial\" or \"/pause-tutorial\" that stops tutorial mode when you just want the agent to take over and make the changes for you.\n\nObviously this approach is much slower, but it also uses a lot less tokens and the output is often much closer to what I want.

The two primary arguments are around price and orchestration.\n\n  \nI haven't really done anything with Claude Code, but I will try it at some point. What is keeping it a low priority is:\n\n  \n1) $200/month of Cursor is keeping me perfectly busy. I haven't spent so much time coding and loving it since college in the 90's\n\n  \n2) I can't get my head around all this talk of orchestration. I have two separate agents for the front and backend of my main project and one for each other project I have. It's a total of 5 agents currently -- one per cursor window.\n\nIt's all I can do to keep up with those 5 and review all the code. Am I just completely missing how fleets of agents would make my work faster? You still need to review the code before deploying to production, right? Right?\n\n3) My assumption is I could run as many agents as I want in Cursor, what is really the advantage there of Claude Code?\n\nMaybe I should post this in their subreddit\n\n  \n",

Is there a reasonably smooth way to pass full repo / multi-file context like Cursor does?\n\nI like Cursor’s workflow a lot, but if the same budget goes much further on Claude directly, I’m wondering whether it’s worth switching (or at least splitting usage).\n\nWould love to hear real-world experiences or suggestions.",

I almost get the impression that it's in the system prompt until it wraps up the task, which makes it really nice especially for long lived sessions.\n\nIt coded for 45 minutes. 45 minutes in a row without stopping. Crunched the tasklist and iterated (with typechecks) until it was achieved. Then code reviewed with a separate agent & fixed that as well.\n\nLaunching multiple agents in parallel seems to be the way to go, especially if you define a frontend plan and a backend plan, they will work independently and converge at the end.\n\nI used to spend 1000+$ on cursor per month, this is just \"personal\" money not including any 9-5, was getting too expensive for the output it produced which in all honesty was subpar at best and it felt like you were paying for broken stuff.",

ChapGPT can spot some issues but I had to handhold it a lot more and feels more like the old teacher that is playing catch up. Not sure if I was using Composer correctly.  \n  \nClaude Code seems to use less tokens to do more. I haven't gotten any usage warnings yet for 20x usage. It's better at having full context on your repository and not getting stuck in fucked up hallucination loops that can cost a lot of credits to try and fix. If I do hit an issue, it only takes a couple prompts to correct and you're not fighting with it to make it understand what you want. Good at going over my old Cursor code and standardizing it, getting rid of over-optimizations, redundancies and stuff. Terminal doesn't have picture import but I haven't really found myself needing it yet, and you can use VS Code if you really need a wrapper.

I recommend having both subscription but not the 200 dollars in any of them. You have to combine subs from different places to survive without ruining your finances. Keep the $60 cursor (or the $20), keep the $20 claude (for claude code), keep the $20 ChatGPT (use codex cli). When you need more juice you can buy more codex credits, affordable.

Cursor acts as the middle man and is dependent on their contractual API costs from the providers. So Opus indeed costs more in Cursor than it would in Claude Code. Some don’t care, since they prefer an IDE and don’t like working in the Terminal. If that however is no problem to you, switch those 200 bucks to Claude Code and you’ll have more usage. You’d however still need an IDE to view changes, but then you don’t need another paid plan (for Cursor) and can just use VS Code.",

In Cursor I use a variety of models, for planning and architecture Opus or GPT 5.2 High or xhigh. Then I have composer implement after the plan. If stuck I use Opus or GPT for issues or heavier tasks. I’d estimate you can import the repo to CC and have the agent get an overview and prepare docs to get familiar with the repo. You can summarize context later on in CC with a pre defined terminal command as far as I know. There are many yt videos on Claude Code - I’m sure there’s one that answers your question better than I can.\n\nYou could also just clone the repo and try it on the cheaper plan and see for yourself how Claude handles that.

I pay for the $60 plan and can get about a week of work out of it with Opus 4.5 (and that is being generous). Some times I can only go 2 days without going over the limit. It just depends on the work. Then in order to get more done, you pay more and more. I’ve spent upwards of $200-300 in a month. Compare that to Claude Code where I could spend $100 and virtually never hit the limit. I still prefer the Cursor experience these days, but it may be worth looking elsewhere.\n\nEdit: it’s important to keep in mind this example is leveraging the Opus 4.5 exclusively. I prefer to work with this model because it works so well. You can get enormously more usage using other models.\n\nEdit: Addressing your comment about Opus flailing on your project, I feel there may be an issue with your workflow. Start new chats as often as possible, be clear and provide context. Starting fresh is almost always better than trying to dig yourself out of a hole.",

You can't tell me shit takes 1 week when I can 1 shot it in cursor with opus while doing 3 other projects at the same time and being in random customers calls.\n\nAt the moment I have about 1/3 of the remaining devs that I don't trust to deliver just hanging around.

Including full automatic deployment script and nightly backup and a full project documentation — took about two weeks of like 2-4 hours work each day, and I am pretty happy with the result. I‘ve limited the agent to Gemini-Flash-3 and it could deal with all issues easily, fulfilled all my special UI requests neatly and even made some great suggestions on some additional polishing (and I am still a bit flashed by the general oversight of the agent, thinking of three other places to adapt things that I only looked at in one specific area…). \nUsage costs so far is like 60€ (which I think is a joke given the work that went into it, the amount of code that was produced and the final functionality being delivered), so 40€ beyond the Pro limit, but I didn‘t quite understand the dashboard, because so far all is displayed as „included“ and my on-demand budget is still untouched…",

However after 5.1 it started to hallucinate too much, started to make wrong decisions continuously, it became less intelligent. \nI also feel that with Web app.\nSo, I stopped using gpt for any planning, decision making or brainstorming. I create plans, designs, schemas, topologies etc with completely opus. Using codex for implementation and review with opus again. \nAlso using sonnet or opus for prompt to implement kind of things, that not require planning etc.\nThis is sad because anthropic models too expensive and waste too much tokens.\n\nI am building a project for 6 months.

I'm relying less on Opus and saving a lot. Sure Codex and Sonnet are still expensive, but all my expense is on company dime anyways, but I still like to keep expenses down just for ROIs sake.\n\nI recommend if you're using Opus a lot, or even Sonnet, give Codex a try.

      "text": "I spent some time digging into the internal config and realized Cursor actually has a pretty powerful hooks system at `~/.cursor/hooks.json`. Unlike Claude Code (which basically only lets you hook into the end of a session), Cursor gives you access to 7 different lifecycle events that fire in real-time.\n\nThe ones I’ve found most useful are `afterAgentThought` and `afterShellExecution`. By setting these up, you can pipe the context of what the agent is doing to a logging script.\n\nThe configuration is straightforward. You point it to a script that accepts JSON via `stdin`. Here’s how I have my `hooks.json` set up to capture everything:\n\nJSON\n\n    {\n      \"version\": 1,\n      \"hooks\": {\n        \"afterAgentThought\": [\n          { \"command\": \"python ~/.cursor/hooks/keywordsai_hook.py\" }\n        ],\n        \"afterShellExecution\": [\n          { \"command\": \"python ~/.cursor/hooks/keywordsai_hook.py\" }\n        ],\n        \"afterFileEdit\": [\n          { \"command\": \"python ~/.cursor/hooks/keywordsai_hook.py\" }\n        ],\n        \"afterMCPExecution\": [\n          { \"command\": \"python ~/.cursor/hooks/keywordsai_hook.py\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n    \n\nThe real benefit here is the granularity. Since it’s event-based, my dashboard shows exactly when the agent paused to think, which files it touched, and the exact output of the terminal commands it ran.\n\nI ended up with hierarchical spans that look like this in my traces:\n\n* **cursor\\_abc123** (38.9s)\n   * ├── **Thinking 1** (0.5s) - \"Let me analyze the code...\"\n   * ├── **Edit:** **utils.py** (0.1s)\n   * ├── **Shell: npm test** (4.1s)\n   * └── **Thinking 3** (0.2s) - \"Tests passed\"\n\nIf you're building complex features where you need an audit trail of what the AI did to your code, this is the way to do it. It’s way better than just scrolling back through the chat history.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bbxcy4pj8edg1.png?width=2292&format=png&auto=webp&s=d020b3e3f02b59aa6f7d5dd561808b7eb9333dae\n\n",

          "text": "Look into a process called Research -> Plan -> Implement. I have this workflow implemented as custom slash commands in Cursor. I built mine using ChatGPT, I imagine everyone is going to want to tune their prompts a little differently. But you want the commands to have some basic properties. Research and Plan should have guardrails to ensure they do not modify code, they just do analysis work and output a markdown file capturing that analysis. Research and Plan should also be told to \"do a deep analysis\" because otherwise the agent will often do a very surface level analysis that is incomplete or inaccurate. All custom commands should have some general guidance that reinforces things like following cursor rules or the agent files.\n\nThe Research command is all about establishing ground truth. What is the current state of the repository in relation to your requirements, what files are relevant to your requirements, are the requirements partially implemented, are there any blockers to implementing your requirements, etc. This command can be useful to establishing your baseline context before implementing a task but it's also useful for auditing your implementation after the fact (like, was the task fully implemented and are there any quality issues?). This will output a research markdown file capturing all of its findings.\n\nI will very frequently run the Research command AFTER implementation with a prompt to verify that the task was fully implemented and to verify that code written follows best practices, agent rules, etc. If it finds any gaps in the implementation I'll just create a plan to close the gaps. This loop makes it far more feasible to complete complex tasks because your essentially using multiple iterations to drift correct.\n\nThe Plan command pretty much works like the built in plan command, but it can be useful to roll your own so you can make it more rigorous both in how deep it analyzes the requirements and how detailed the final plan is.\n\nIt's also useful to have the Research and Plan commands capture a snapshot of the requirements in their output so subsequent steps have that context available to them.\n\nThe Implement command is also similar to just running the prompt in agent mode but again, defining it as a custom command let's you reinforce guardrails (must follow agent rules, must make small targeted edits, must lint and test all changes, etc.) Some people like to have the Implement command output an implementation summary markdown file, I personally prefer to have it output the summary in the chat. Also, I recommend putting guidance in the Implement command to have it stop and ask for clarification if any of the requirements are incomplete or ambiguous, this will also save a lot of headaches and can prevent drift.\n\nWhen your executing a task you would do something like:\n\n\\- /research <your prompt with your requirements>\n\n\\- /plan <the research markdown file produced in the previous step>\n\n\\- /implement <the plan markdown file produced in the previous step>\n\nFor smaller tasks you can often skip the Research step, but at least doing the Plan step will save a lot wasted time and credits. One of the key things that the Research and Plan markdown files give you is a chance to review what the agent is going to do before it tries to implement the changes. I have my custom commands include open questions if anything is unclear, and I'll usually spend a few minutes dialing in the markdown file before I move on to the next step. If your Research is dialed in you have a much higher chance of producing a solid plan and if you produce a solid plan you have a much higher change of actually implementing it.\n\nThe other big thing that outputting these markdown files give you is context that you can include in a new chat which I think is critical for context management. I'll typically run Research and Plan in a single chat but I almost always run Implement in a new chat because the agents can really suck after you've used more than like 50% of the context. I have the commands put my markdown files in a tmp/ directory in the workspace which I .gitignore.\n\nFrom my experience, this has sped up my workflow because I don't have to do rework nearly as often and has actually reduced credit use. It also lets me rely on auto mode for most tasks. People throwing Opus at everything probably just have workflow issues. I think a big part of why it reduces credit use is that running a prompt without the research or plan artifacts means the agent has to establish context like where files are and it's super inefficient at this. Front-loading that analysis mean the Implement command knows where it's supposed to be working and it can focus it's effort on actually writing code rather than building that baseline context.\n\nThere are tons of ways to make your actual coding more efficient which are very stack dependent, but I think establishing a solid workflow is the first step in really making efficient use of Cursor. Also, if you create these custom commands and you see behavior you don't like, you can always just tune the command. If I run into issues with one of my commands I copy it to ChatGPT, explain what it's doing wrong, what I would like it to do, and ask ChatGPT to revise my command to fix the issue. Then I copy the updated command back into Cursor and get back to work.",

I used Opus but one prompt consuming those many credits is unusable for most development in my opinion. How is everyone else working with cursor or are you switching to something else?\n\nWould they refund for such short usage (1 prompt) even if its a prorated refund of remaining credits?\n\nEdit: I went back the next day and without any further chats it now says 14% consumed.

You are right.\nThis is obviously a crap deal for the common people that don't have some deep pocket company paying for the subscription. Also, a 200$ subscription will get you nowhere at this rate. If you have to get cursor+something else like claude pro, then why do you need cursor? You can just have vscode + claude and ditch the cursor sub.\n\nIf they tell you to manage models by task, then just get windscribe and use their much better option of free models + opus and you have 500 prompts to play with every month (opus rate is 4x) for less than a cursor sub. There is claude pro which gives you more opus prompts, there is antigravity which gives you more opus prompts... Heck, pay for windscribe+claude+antigravity and you will still pay less than half of the 200$ cursor max sub and you'll basically never run out of opus prompts if that's what you want.\n\nCursor WAS a great tool when they had the 500 prompt plan.

Turns out when they made the change to API-based pricing in September, I assume it had immediately affected my subscription but no, it only came into play once my subscription renewed.\n\nI raised this as a concern to them once I noticed the discrepancy, and asked if I could cancel my account for a refund (so I could upgrade to the pro/max plan, as while on the yearly I can't change my plan). The response was that as soon as a yearly subscription renews, thats it. You're stuck, no refund, bad luck.\n\nI asked if I could simply \"convert\" the \\~£300 yearly subscription into a monthly subscription for 2 months, but:\n\n>Annual subscriptions can’t be converted into monthly plans or translated into credits for other plans. Once an annual plan renews, it remains active for the full term.\n\n>You can cancel the annual subscription to prevent renewal at the end of the term, but the current annual period can’t be refunded, shortened, or exchanged for monthly plans.\n\n>I know this isn’t the outcome you were hoping for, but this is our final position. If you want help optimizing usage within your current plan or understanding which plan will make sense once the annual term ends, I’m happy to help.\n\nSo I'm now out of pocket for \\~£300 on my current plan, which doesn't cover my usage, and have had to pay an extra \\~£100 for the incurred usage outside of my plan (which is partially my fault for having PAYG switched on, but hadn't had an issue with it previously).\n\nI've now cancelled and switching over to Claude Code. It's a shame, I had really enjoyed using Cursor but this kind of money-grabbing and inflexibility sucks.",

Refusing to crossgrade long-term users is... a bold choice for the company with the most expensive per-token service right now. Their entry-level tier is great, but they hose daily paid users to cover that generosity.\n\nAnyway, turns out you get thousands of dollars of usage for $200 with Claude Code (I was running closer to $600 with Cursor's 50% overage markup), so I left won't be coming back. The workflow feels different at first, but the output is as good if not better.",

However, the recent aggressive update cycle is prioritizing \"new features\" over stability, and my team is losing trust.\n\n# 1. The Bug: Data Loss in Plan Mode\n\n**Warning to others:** Be careful with the Markdown/Preview toggle in the new Plan Mode.\n\nI spent the last two days planning a complex feature. This morning, I simply toggled the view from **Markdown -> Preview -> Markdown**. The window hanged and when I reopened the markdown was gone.\n\n* **The Result:** All of my descriptive markdown text disappeared.\n* **What was left:** Only the specific TODO items remained.\n* **Impact:** I lost the entire logic and context for the feature (2 days of work).\n\n# 2. General Feedback: The \"Silent\" Feature Churn\n\nI checked the changelog, and while it highlights new agentic features, it fails to document **breaking changes** to existing workflows.\n\n* Features are added/removed without reasoning (similar to the confusion when \"Custom Modes\" were changed/removed in v2.1).\n* UI elements shift without documentation.\n* Workflows that have been stable for months suddenly break.\n\n**To the Cursor Team:** We want to use this tool. We pay for this tool. But you are **risking losing trust from teams that pay thousands of dollars a month** by pushing updates that delete data or break workflows without warning. We need a \"Stable\" release channel or a changelog that actually explains *removals*, not just new features.\n\n**TL;DR:** Plan mode deleted my plan when toggling preview (lost 2 days of work), and the lack of transparency regarding breaking changes is becoming significantly irksome.",

              "text": "+1. Cursor is absolute trash when using Anthropic models as well. It’s night and day between Cursor and Claude Code with the exact same prompts. \n\nSimple example for those that might downvote. I prompted Cursor to create a markdown file outlining a playbook on how to replace an SSL cert, referencing some custom scripts in the same repo. Cursor not only created the markdown, but 3 other markdowns on how to deploy it, one on how to update it, one how how it was designed, and finally one how to use it (the only one I asked for). Same prompt to Claude and I got a single output, as expected. It’s too eager and does way more than what’s in the session instructions.",
