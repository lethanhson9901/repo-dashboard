          "text": "Hi, we are working very hard on reducing the token consumption for all our users and not increasing token costs. You can compare them with AI provider pricing directly.   \n  \nTo reduce token consumption we relased:   \n\\- Dynamic Context Management: less context required for Agent to do the task, as MCPs/Rules/Logs/etc are fetched without having to attach them all at same time.  \n\\- Subagents: using cheaper models for simpler tasks like code search and returning only info the main agent needs.  \n\\- Efficient tooling: requiring less tokens and less failures which saves tokens as well.  \n\\- And more...\n\nWhat has changed? Models get better which enables you to do more, but they also have higher API pricing which increases cost.\n\nLet me know how you prompt and manage context, I would gladly suggest ways to reduce token consumptions. Less requests does not always result in less cost so it depends on how you use AI.",

I have burnt through an ultra plan in a few days in comparison to other plans that are direct from providers. I am aware that they’re greatly subsidized, and in the long-term, I think once subsidies fall off cursor is going to be in a very good position.  Between now and that time I think finding a way for unlimited auto to make a comeback would be very interesting. \n\nI think the cursor team is doing a fantastic job, but they’re gonna be pushed out of the market due to pricing and that is the entire plan for Claude code.\n\nMy only comment would be do not underestimate the value of transparency with coming to market with an “unlimited auto” plan that has limitations to make the offering viable monetarily. \n\nThe only way cursor loses the development community is through these subsidized plans from providers. Frankly, I would actually encourage cursor to sign a deal with ChatGPT allow allowing for individuals to bring in their Codex subscriptions for a small fee.  That generates revenue for cursor and helps OpenAI gain market share.\n\nI think it is also interesting that OpenAI is going to be releasing garlic that should be incredibly efficient.  That could change a lot of the math that is currently making cursor hard to justify.\n\nLastly, I’d like to thank the cursor team for everything that you guys do. It’s very easy to criticize the work that is being done, but I believe that the IDE that is being built is phenomenal. It is just becoming unviable based on the economics involved.",

Swapping to lighter models for simpler tasks and turning Agent off for quick edits can stretch the same $70 a lot further.",

Being able to get that fast feedback loop in Cursor is a game-changer for mobile dev.\n\nI’ve been deep in the same trenches lately, but focusing on the human-input side with my project, **WiFi Mouse**. I noticed most remote tools struggle with 'cursor trailing' or 'ghosting' due to TCP overhead, so I ended up rebuilding the communication logic around **UDP with a custom packet-drop strategy**. It's interesting to see how we both prioritized 'speed' but for different use cases—yours for automation/dev feedback, mine for making a phone feel like a 1:1 physical trackpad.\n\nAside from the ultra-low latency, I’ve packed in things like **Remote Clipboard, Media Controls, and an App Launcher** to make it a full productivity remote.\n\nDef checking out your `ios-builder` repo—Flutter iOS dev on Windows is a massive pain point.

It's also nice to have model diversity. Though lately using Opus w/ well engineered ralph loops is changing the game for us. I can't stress the \"well engineered\" part of that because just using the plugin is a crutch. Also plan to test out the Cursor CLI w/ ralph soon but moving so quickly w/ CC right now there's no point.",

Key concept is removing \"human in the loop\" and replacing with \"human on the loop\". I have a CC framework based on a filesystem - super new & something a partner spun up that I like (https://github.com/coreyepstein/hq-starter-kit). I added something called /pure-ralph that spawns a terminal that acts as orchestrator which spawns individual terminals with isolated agents for each task in a PRD. It's all super early but Geoff promotes learning through iteration - watch each step and tune your infrastructure based on observation. \n\nThis is a decent resource for learning concepts, too - [https://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-ralph-wiggum](https://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-ralph-wiggum)\n\nKeeping context focused and uncompressed is a key part of it. \n\nBut yeah basically I'm still learning too but my velocity is super accelerated right now and it was already pumped from using Cursor from day 1. My pure-ralph has --manual/-m parameter so you can watch each CC terminal as it tackles each step in a PRD. Seeing where it makes mistakes and adding guardrails, instructions or tooling to help it not make the same mistakes again. Super fun.",

Predicts the most likely textual answer.\n\nClaude Code uses what Anthropic calls an \"Agentic Workflow.\" Unlike a chat window, it is given a set of Tools (Read, Write, Shell, Search) and a mandate to \"Solve the Goal.\"\n\nInteresting example I found is when there was issue SQL Claude Code directly jump to solution and it’s work but it’s break other record retrieval. Where Cursor asked me to check db record or run sample query to see whether record has problem or not. And issue was with record itself. Both scene using Opus 4.5. Both has pros and cons we need to learn how to them effectively.",

But the biggest difference is how I could follow along the thinking path of the model in Cursor compared to CC, and how I could see all of the changes they made as saved but not yet approved clearly and individually reject or modify without losing which parts are modified in Cursor. Also going back and forth by changes in the staging before commit is very important for me. I also tried the cursor extension of CC, same thing.

Maybe I'm missing something?   \n\n\nFor comparison, if I were to use OpenRouter or something and just added $60 to my account, that would be available to me until it was used up.

This breaks the pricing model because now Cursor is selling $35 of service for $30.\n\nIf you don’t like it, then you can go to another provider and pay by token, but when you do this, you will be paying $30 for a $30 limit, not $30 for a $35 limit.",

I have new projects where I have a perfectly clean pattern for doing things and no matter how many times I have my AGENTS.md file optimized, at the end of the day the only way to enforce clean agentic code is by utilizing hooks which can lint, clean, and even spin up sub-agents of their own. Sadly, Claude Code's hook functionality is a year behind the hooks in OpenCode, so it's not as cut and dry to do as I would like. \n\nI have got much better skills and sub-agents now then I did 6 months ago. It's a trial and error process of learning what works and what doesn't. I learned really quickly that those \"libraries\" of Claude Code skills and agents are hot garbage. \n\nThe best skill I ever built for Claude comes with several node scripts and also works on Gemini CLI. It's a one-size-fits-all solution for Playwright screenshots in everything from behind login screens to running Claude in a container. It knows how to take a screenshot perfectly every time in any screen size and with any combination of click and keyboard events - with no fuss and no wasted tokens (Playwright MCP is horrendous at wasting tokens).\n\nAs far as this project goes, I'll have to give it a try. Context management and the stateless nature of these transformer models is the single biggest issue to deal with. It's like you feel yourself repeating yourself every session despite having what you assume is all the info already in AGENTS.md (or equivalent). If tools like this can automatically help with some of these issues then it's at least worth a try. I'll be trying it to see if it's worth the context window cost.",

The other $29 plans or anything like that won't work.\n\nI got really lost among all the different pricing plans, and the only ones that work so far are the $100 x5 plans.\n\n\nOnce that's done, you install the extension on Antigravity and click the link.\nI then had to copy and paste a 10-meter-long code snippet from the webpage into the extension located in VS Code.\n\nHere's something to know:\nClaude has its own language panel, located next to the Antigravity panel. To activate it each time (I haven't found a better way yet), I have to search for the Claude extension, open the panel, and click on the little Claude star at the top. The panel then opens, and you're good to go. It takes 3 seconds.\n\nYou have to do this every time you reopen Antigravity. As I said, there must be an easier way to open the agent window, but I haven't found it.\n\nHappy coding! 😜",

Codex does a great job so far.\n\n13m tokens with opus was 17.88 while I have used over 37m tokens with codex and it's been 9.13 so far, so I used about 3x more tokens with codex and still paid almost half of what I paid for opus... Don't care how good the model is supposedly, it isn't 5-6x better than the competition to justify that cost. Anthropic need to figure out their pricing, till then I am not touching it.",

Doing so could help reduce our reliance on expensive options like Opus or GPT models and significantly lower costs.\n\nFrom what I’ve heard, these open-source models are already quite strong. They just require more baby sitting and supervision to produce consistent, high-quality outputs, which is completely acceptable for engineering-heavy use cases like ours.\n\nIf anyone from the cursor team has insights on this, it would be really helpful.\n\ncurrently i use both Cursor and GitHub Copilot, both does not provide oss models yet, idk why, isn't this known as gate-keeping?\n\nAnyway thanks, and keep shipping!",

Also, they probably do have deals with openAI / Claude for cheaper API pricing, and these deals might include some clauses against OSS models.\n\n2) Cursor tries not to blindly add models, and each model they have might have tweaks with prompt/tools, which means that adding new models is longer process that to just add a provider + specify model name. Cursor team claims that m2.1/GLM 4.7 do not pass their internal evals, up to you to believe that or not.\n\n3) Related to previous but a bit separate, there seems to be some skill issues on dev team with OSS models. They, somehow, managed to add kimi k2 with a bug(it output a new line for each token) and they don't want to spend dev time on learning how to properly add models.",

A command is effectively one-shot: input goes in, a prompt runs, and an output comes back, with no notion of progress or adaptation. A skill, by contrast, can plan work, take actions, inspect results, adjust its approach, and decide whether to continue or stop. While commands may internally “think” in steps, that process is hidden and fixed; skills expose that loop and use it to drive decisions. Because of that, “stateful” is a bit misleading in classic systems terms — a clearer description is “explicit multi-step execution with working memory.”",

I rely on it every day, and that's not going to change. However, the Auto model doesn't meet my expectations of the quality of output, even after making good prompts—the quality of response of more premium models is far better. But premium models burn through tokens very quickly, so I have to restrict their use a lot.\n\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is how other full-time users balance this in practice so that a $60/month plan is actually enough.\n\nMore concretely:\n\n1. How do you structure your model usage so that a $60/month plan works for full-time work?\n   * Do you reserve expensive models only for certain categories of tasks (e.g., architecture, bigger refactors, complex debugging) and use Auto for everything else?\n   * Do you have any rough strategy like \"expensive model only for the first deep pass, then Auto for iterations,\" or a certain percentage of requests you cap it at?\n2. How do you decide *when* to switch from Auto to a better model during a session?\n   * Do you start with Auto and upgrade only if the answer is clearly not good enough, or do you always start with a premium model for some types of tasks?\n   * Do you rewrite/shorten prompts when using expensive models to save tokens, or keep a separate \"short prompt style\" for them?\n3. For people who feel a noticeable quality gap but still stay within $60: what does your day look like?\n   * Rough number of chats/tasks per day.\n   * How often you end up on a premium model in a typical day or week.\n   * Any practical tricks to avoid burning tokens unnecessarily (e.g., resetting vs continuing a long thread, how long you let a thread run on an expensive model, etc.).\n\nI'm not questioning the value of the better models—I actually prefer working with them. I'm just trying to learn from others how to use them *strategically* so that:\n\n* Auto covers as much as possible, and\n* higher-end models are used in a targeted way that fits into a $60/month budget for a full-time job.\n\nFor context: the $60 plan doesn't work for me because at my company I'm basically working alone on the entire application/module, which requires a lot of coding with AI assistance.\n\nWould really appreciate concrete examples of your model mix, settings, and habits.

Every time you want to run something with Opus, you use Claude Code to hit the 5 hour cooldown and then use Cursor to fill in the in-between with composer or auto. The extension allows you to stay inside Cursor and just have yet another agent window for Claude.\n\nThat way, you will still have Cursor as an IDE with their tab completion, but take most of the expensive prompts with the 20 dollar subscription.",

          "text": "So, i'm NOT a person you want an answer from, as i'm not a full time user at all. I'm not a dev at all, but just some dude that works on a pretty complex program for over a year now, and since like 4 or 5 months i use Cursor with the 20$ plan. So in know i'm not your target audience; but maybe my strategy isn't all that dumb. \n\nMy workflow is the following:   \n\\- i use Gemini 3 Pro as a \"Senior Coder\". That means: any idea i have; any blueprinting, creating concepts, etc... ANYTHING that's not certain yet, i do in Gemini 3 Pro. \n\n\\- i use Obsidian do keep a good documentation about ideas i have, bugfix reports, concepts, dataflows (with canvas etc) \n\n\\- i use Cursor as a \"coding bot\" without real agency 95% of the time.. . All i let it do is just type out everythign i designed\n\nWith Cursor, i use basically 2 modes: Planing and Building the plan. EVERYTHING i let Cursor do is planned out in advance, i feed that plan into Gemini and ask for feedback; if there's any i incorporate that and then let Cursor build it. Auto Mode almost exclusively. An exception are the times where very, very complex stuff needs to be done or stuff that's very important.\n\nSo basically:\n\n\\- I design the systems, etc and think of my own solutions; prototype Code (usually only elements of it) and then feed that into Gemini 3 Pro\n\n\\- Gemini Pro does the professional thinking; it checks if my idea is doable, if what i prototyped has glaring flaws or issues, thinks of other or different solutions, looks up libraries we will use, and anything that's relevant here. I let Gemini create documents that specify the technical details that are required to make stuff work like intended.\n\n\\- I go into Obsidian, create a prompt for Cursor. Since my professional background is Law, i usually build my prompts like a contract or other legal document; working in many small steps, defining everything i can as precisely as i can. To me it feels like the most important practice in creating the prompt is NEGATIVE definitions. Telling Cursor what we're NOT doing is really helpful. Looks somehting like this: \n\n1. Introduction / Purpose of the prompt (What are we doing and why?) \n2. Definitions (What are the critical components?)\n3. Detailed information (What do we want and why exactly? What's especially important and what's the though process of why we want that?)\n4.  Context (What other, not directly related information could be important to what we're doing?)\n5. Final thoughts\n\n\\- I feed that into Cursor with the \"Plan\"-mode. \n\n\\- The output of that plan is fed back to Gemini and i ask if that's good or not, what we should change, etc. \n\n\\- I let Cursor build the entire plan in Auto-Mode.\n\n  \nThis wokflow, so far, worked really well. I almost never have to correct stuff; re-prompt or change what it does. It just oneshots the entire process; even if it's VERY complex (well, for my standards - as i said: i have a background in Law; not in programming). \n\nLast thing it did was a FULL GUI migration from CustomTKinter to PyQt6 - for a program i'm working on that currently has around 90 individual .py files with a pretty complex back-end, SQL-DB connections, ML-models, etc. \n\nIf i have to correct stuff, it's smaller details like \"this UI element doesnt look like i want to or is in the wrong position\". But functionally, it's a very, very high hit-rate. \n\nMy time spent is almost all outside of Cursor, creating the prompts, etc. Those i just paste in there and let it loose.",

One topic = one agent: Avoid developing 10 changes in one agent chat window\n4. Give every new agent the right context upfront. (I use and developed VibeGuard for this. Vebeguard creates a long term project memory from your repo and decisions, so you do not have to keep pasting context every session. If you want to try: `npm install -g` @getvibeguard/cli and then vibeguard init inside your project.",

Because if you are the one managing it, yeah - it can be expected to atleast check what general settings might be there.",

Today, he sends me a passive/aggressive slack saying \"cursor auto-complete not working?\" because if you look at our cursor dash, it shows that I'm in the top 10 (out of 18) for cursor usage and all of it is accepted diffs with only 2 tab completions (it was 0 for the longest time).  Attached it the slack convo, you can see my response, which is basically that I don't use tab completions, I literally don't use em.  I vibe code almost everything and the one or two lines that I need to change during debugging if there's an issue, I don't use tab autocomplete for.  I really think tab completions are going to be an obsolete workflow in the near future.  Wanted to get some thoughts and perhaps start some discussion.  \n",
