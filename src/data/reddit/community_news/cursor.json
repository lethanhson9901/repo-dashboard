These are the ones you must have\n\n**Context 7** is like having a really smart friend who always knows the latest way to use any coding library. No more outdated examples that don't work.\n\n**Docker MCP** is genius because it keeps things clean. Instead of having hundreds of tools cluttering everything up, it only loads what you need right now.\n\n**Shadcn Registry MCP** makes building pretty websites super easy. You just ask for a component and it knows exactly how to add it without breaking stuff.\n\n**Google's new MCPs** are pretty cool if you use Google services. They just announced ones for Maps, BigQuery, and cloud stuff. There are also free ones for Firebase and other Google tools.\n\n**Notion MCP** has been a lifesaver for me. I can tell Claude to update my to-do lists, track projects, and organize ideas without ever opening Notion.\n\n**Supabase MCP** handles all the database work. No more writing confusing database commands myself - Claude just does it.\n\n  \nAnyone else using MCPs? Which ones do you like most?",

The critique step is key. It usually finds obvious fixes to lift scores from the 65-75 range.\n\nI also love to add to the first step \"do at least 10 web searches as of Dec 26, 2025 (not 2024)\" to ground it in the latest methods/versions/docs, etc.\n\nIf the task is complex or undefined, I like this:\n“Ask me 5 questions (1-5 sentences each) in a numbered list with a, b, c choices”\n\nDo another round if questions were good.\n\nThen:\n“In two paragraphs of 6-8 dense sentences each, restate my requirements in your own words”\n\nAs for what exactly I’m working on - can’t say just yet, a bit stealth but some vanilla JS websites for my business on Cloudflare Workers",

It's very fast, easy, and lazy to make bold assertions backed by nothing, while actual explanations take a long time and a lot of words. \n\nDid you read my findings or are you just responding to the summary? \n\nIf you give a model a clear set of instructions and strict code standards that explain the exact requirements for the work, and it doesn't follow them, that's not a problem prompting the model, that's a problem with the model not implementing all the constraints provided. \n\nFor example, in the last hour, I've had Claude read my instructions that explain exactly how to order a workflow - strict TDD, lowest deps to highest, types first, then type guards, then source - and build a work plan. These instructions are extremely clear. And it not only ignores them, it does the opposite. It describes doing the highest level work before the lowest level, lumping types into a monolithic file instead of putting them where they go, putting type guards directly in the interface, changing the names of everything, type casting, type aliasing. \n\nThe models just don't follow instructions well. This results in the vast majority of work being wasted while the user has to review the work, explain what instructions were violated, demand correction, over and over and over until the agent finally, incrementally, bit by bit, step by step, turn by turn, implements constraint 1, then constraint 2, then constraint 3, and so on, until you reach constraint n. \n\nThose constraints were all provided in the very first turn, and are easy to follow. The agents just do not do what they're told.\n\nThis is not user error. This is a shortcoming of the models. \n\nNow, to your point, no, I do not believe they are built for software engineers. A software engineer wouldn't type cast at every opportunity. They wouldn't alias imports for no apparent reason, or import entire modules to get a single function. Import a type just to export it again so they can import it from another file instead of importing it from the canonical source. Produce inline types in tests, that only exist in tests, instead of building an actual correct type and using it.\n\nIf they were built for software engineers, they wouldn't default to lazy hacky slop that no self-respecting software engineer will accept. An agent built for software engineers would be designed to follow provided code standards and do exactly what they're told - the same standard any developer on a professional team would be held to.\n\nI think they're built to impress investors with gee whiz, wow-factor big-bang \"one shot\" prompt techniques so that the investor, who has no idea what clean code and clean architecture looks like, will say \"oh man, wow, that's amazing!\" and write a big check, not realizing that the actual work product that \"amazes\" them is unmaintainable non-standards-compliant garbage.",

I provide my agents with a full set of documentation (planning doc, step-by-step development plan, branding guide, code architecture doc and data schema) and ensure the instructions in the development plan are sufficiently detailed to provide clear directions and guardrails.",

User trust matters a lot in anything memory-related, so data access and isolation are things we take very seriously.

Things like \"always use TypeScript strict mode\" and \"prefer functional components\" - pretty standard stuff.\n\nBut Cursor straight up ignores them. Like they don't exist.\n\nHere's where it gets frustrating:\n\n* If I put the same rules in `.cursorrules` at my project root → **works perfectly**\n* If I put them in User Rules (Settings) → **nothing happens**\n\n**The Corporate Catch-22:**\n\nMy company has a policy: no `.cursorrules` file in repos (CTO maintains that), and we can't gitignore it either. So I'm stuck needing *global* rules that apply to everything I code, but the feature that's supposed to do exactly that... doesn't.\n\n**What I've Tried:**\n\n* Restarting Cursor (multiple times)\n* Different models (Claude 3.5, GPT-4)\n* Clearing settings and re-adding rules\n* Checked the official docs (they're... sparse on this)\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n1. Does anyone else's User Rules actually work? What am I missing?\n2. Is there a workaround for getting global rules without `.cursorrules`?\n3. Has anyone found success with the new `.cursor/rules/` folder approach for personal rules?\n\n  \nI've seen some people use tools like [cursor.directory](https://cursor.directory) or [promptdir.info](https://promptdir.info) to manage and organize their rules - curious if anyone's had better luck with external rule management that can be applied globally.\n\nAny help would be huge. This feels like such a basic feature that should \"just work.\"",

                  "text": "(its a flask n postgres project)# YourProject — Agent Instructions (Production)\n\nThese instructions apply to the entire repository rooted at `/path/to/your/project`.\n\n## Non‑negotiables\n\n1. Every modification must be documented in `changes.md` (see \"Change documentation\").\n2. Preserve production safety: do not bypass CSRF, rate limiting, session validation, or security middleware.\n3. Do not break gevent startup ordering: `startup.py` must monkey‑patch before any SSL/network imports.\n4. Prefer small, surgical edits; avoid large rewrites of `app.py` unless explicitly requested.\n\n## Project reality (keep changes aligned)\n\n- **Production context**\n  - High-traffic deployment behind Cloudflare + Traefik (`your-site.example.com`).\n  - Real client IP comes from Cloudflare (`CF-Connecting-IP`) and must not be spoofable.\n- **Entry points**\n  - `app.py` defines the global Flask application (`app = Flask(__name__)`).\n  - `startup.py` exists to enforce gevent monkey‑patching order for production.\n- **Deployment**\n  - Docker Compose service: `your-service` (with `your-service_postgres`, `your-service_redis`) in `docker-compose.yml`.\n  - Gunicorn gevent workers (default `GUNICORN_WORKERS=6`); DB pool sizing depends on worker count.\n- **Auth**\n  - Session-based authentication (not JWT). Check `session.get('user_id')` / `session.get('is_admin')`.\n- **Configuration**\n  - Centralized config lives in `config_manager.py` (`config_manager` singleton). Prefer reading config from there (or passing config into helpers) instead of sprinkling new `os.getenv(...)` calls.\n- **Data storage**\n  - JSON files under `DATA_DIR` (Docker mounts `./data` → `/data`); use `routes/data_paths.py`.\n  - PostgreSQL integration is enabled when `USE_DATABASE=true` via `database_integration.py` (psycopg2 pool + tenacity).\n- **Redis**\n  - Redis is used for caching/sessions/rate limiting; always use `redis_manager.py` APIs (built-in fallback exists).\n\n## Coding style\n\n- Prefer functions + small modules; add type hints for touched function signatures where reasonable (use `python3`, not `python`).\n- Use guard clauses (early returns) for invalid states; keep the happy path last; avoid deep nesting.\n- Avoid circular imports: do not import from `app.py` inside blueprints/utilities unless unavoidable—extract shared helpers instead.\n- Prefer a simple RORO shape for helpers: accept a single dict-like \"params/context\" object, return a dict result.\n\n## Routes and request lifecycle\n\n- Prefer placing new routes in `routes/` as Blueprints and registering them in `app.py` near the existing blueprint section.\n- Use existing decorators/hooks consistently:\n  - Security: `security_middleware.security_check` (and app-level `before_request` protections)\n  - Rate limiting: `rate_limiting.rate_limit` / other limiter helpers\n  - CSRF: `csrf_protection.csrf_required` for all state-changing endpoints\n- Return shapes:\n  - HTML routes: redirect with user-friendly messages.\n  - API routes: JSON errors with appropriate status codes.\n\n## Security standards (production)\n\n- State-changing routes (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE): require `@csrf_required` and an appropriate rate-limit decorator.\n- Apply request validation consistently: prefer `security_middleware.security_check` on blueprint routes and keep app-level `before_request` protections intact.\n- Treat all headers/paths as untrusted:\n  - Keep Cloudflare-aware IP detection order; do not trust `X-Forwarded-For` without proxy validation.\n  - Validate all filesystem paths and user-provided filenames.\n- Validate/sanitize user input with existing validators (`input_validation.py`) and log security-relevant failures with request context.\n- For subprocess/system calls, prefer `secure_subprocess.py`; avoid ad-hoc `subprocess.*` with untrusted input.\n- Do not weaken CSP/HSTS/security headers (Traefik labels + Flask `after_request`) without an explicit, documented reason and verification plan.\n\n## Performance standards (high-traffic)\n\n- Avoid per-request disk work: use `data_cache.load_json_cached(...)` for reads and `atomic_update_json(...)` for writes.\n- Keep lock windows small: do expensive validation/processing before entering `atomic_update_json` update functions.\n- Prefer caching over recomputation: use Redis-backed caches where available; code must still work when Redis is down (fallback mode).\n- Don't block request workers with long I/O (file/network): use `async_operations.py` patterns for background/async work.\n- Keep DB usage pool-friendly: short transactions, fetch only needed fields, return connections promptly, and avoid N+1 patterns.\n\n## JSON config/data edits (important)\n\n- Treat JSON files as shared concurrent state (multiple workers/requests).\n- For reads: prefer `data_cache.load_json_cached(...)`.\n- For writes: prefer `data_cache.atomic_update_json(path, update_fn)`; do not hand-roll read/modify/write.\n- When adding new JSON files, put them under `data/` (or `DATA_DIR`) and keep schemas backward-compatible.\n\n## File uploads and filesystem\n\n- For uploads and file writes, prefer hardened helpers:\n  - Path/file validation: `secure_file_ops.SecureFileOperations`\n  - Atomic JSON: `atomic_json.AtomicJSONManager`\n  - File locking: `file_locking.FileLockManager`\n- Always use `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename` for user-provided filenames and validate content (extension + magic) before processing.\n\n## Database integration (PostgreSQL)\n\n- Use `database_integration.py` as the primary API surface when `USE_DATABASE=true`.\n- Always acquire connections via context management:\n  - `DatabaseConnectionContext` or decorators in `database_decorator.py` (e.g., `@with_database_context`).\n- Never hold a DB connection across requests; always return to the pool.\n- Use `RealDictCursor` when you need dict-like row access.\n\n## Redis\n\n- Use `redis_manager.redis_manager` (singleton) or `app.redis_manager` when available.\n- Prefer `redis_manager.get(...)` / `redis_manager.set(...)` and `@redis_operation` to get automatic fallback behavior.\n- Don't assume Redis is up: code must behave correctly when `redis_manager.is_connected` is `False`.\n\n## Logging, monitoring, and errors\n\n- Prefer production/structured logging helpers (`production_logging.py`, `structured_logging.py`).\n- Avoid logging secrets (session cookies, passwords, tokens, raw auth headers).\n- Use existing error patterns (`error_handling.py`, `error_handler.py`, `specific_error_handlers.py`) for consistency.\n\n## Running / maintenance\n\n- Deploy/rebuild service: `make build` (runs Docker Compose for `your-service` as configured).\n- Quick syntax check: `python3 -m compileall .`\n\n## Change documentation (required)\n\nAll modifications must be documented in `changes.md` immediately after implementation. Each entry must include:\n\n- Timestamp\n- Files touched\n- Exact code added/removed/changed (include file paths and line numbers where applicable)\n- What the change does + why it was made",

You easily see just how often your rules are ignored.\n\n\nTo make matters worse, I also use Claude Code in Cursor, which has its own method of adding rules. The setup I found to be the best is to add a cursor rule in your user settings saying ALWAYS read and follow all instructions in my AGENTS.md and global CLAUDE.md files. Then at the top of AGENTS.md reference your CLAUDE.md with a similar rule. Do the same in your CLAUDE.md.\n\n\nAlso make sure you update your cursor settings to \"always\" (aka, sometimes, when it feels like it) use your CLAUDE.md.\n\n\nThis way Cursor and Claude Code will, in my experience, always find and use your rules. I keep project specific rules and general information in AGENTS.md and my global rules in CLAUDE.md.\n\n\nI have also heard, and I forget the source, that AGENTS.md is loaded in context at a more.... privileged? Level. Somewhere between user query and system prompt. I think this matters because the models will interpret it with a more direct interpretation.

I really value knowing for sure when the system is allowed to edit my code versus when it’s just answering questions.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations?\nThank you\n\n",

      "text": "Recently I've made the swtich from Cursor to Zed because cursor performance has been terrible since 2.0, and I'm loving Zed but couldn't completely switch yet cause I'm feeling Claude on Zed is not as good as it is on Cursor, yeah I know that sounds unlikely right?\n\nI'm using the same model (sonnet most of the time) same rules (cursor settings and .claude/rules), Pro+ plan on Cursor and Pro on Claude (I highly doubt this make any difference anyways) and using it for web development (React + RoR) always planning first and guiding the agent step by step if necessary. And still there's times I feel that Claude on Zed is so much \"dumb\" than when used on Cursor, while on my Claude average use on Cursor I need 2 to 3 prompts to complete a task/step then on Zed I need a lot more cause most of the time the agent is not following all my rules or ignoring project patterns, typescript types and leaving the same lint errors that I asked it to fix few prompts ago.\n\nSo I've made some tests to confirm that, I was starting a new project on Elysia (first time using it) so I created a new project using Elysia cli, made a clone of it and asked the same prompts on both editors using Claude sonnet 4.5:\n\n\\- First I started asking for both agents what are the rules they are receiving in my prompts, there wasn't any project/workspace rule, just the user rules on Cursor and claude global rules on ./claude/rules, [this are the rules I use globally for all AI agents btw](https://gist.github.com/guustavocl/9776865c5964933600701149512b7cbb). So the results were the following:\n\nClaude on Cursor answered with those exactly same rules that I defined on its settings, while Claude on Zed also returned the global rules I defined but not before a huge set of additional rules/explanations/conduct, tbh a load of garbage stuff that's just stalling instead of helping, so maybe that's the cause of the inconsistency between them. (also just remembered that you can also place the rules inside Zed editor, but that doesn't seems to work, if you place it there and ask the agent to list the rules he will never list the ones you placed there)\n\n\\- Next I started asking both agents to setup Eslint and Prettier in the project, neither opted to run the init cli command instead they created the config files manually, they didn't used the .cjs extension for eslint but .json, that's fine it worked as intended at the end.\n\n\\- Next I explained our goals: \"This is a new Elysia API project, we gonna use MongoDB and Mongoose with BetterAuth for authentication, also we gonna need to add openapi and validate our routes using TypeBox, we also need to protect our posts POST/UPDATE/DELETE routes with normal user authorization, and our users GET/UPDATE/DELETE with admin authorization, users don't need a POST route cause we're using sign\\_up from betterauth for that.\".\n\nthen both agents proceeded with planning/explaining to me what they're gonna do first and waiting for approval to start coding, as stated on my rules, both plans were pretty similar so I give them the approval...\n\nNeither nailed it on the first or second try ofc, I've choose MongoDB on purpose cause there's plenty of examples out there using PG/Drizzle with better auth while MongoDB it's listed as experimental, so that's okay and manageable, they've missed some adapters configs and weird stuffs as using id: string instead of mongo \\_id: objectId (default and implicit), but manageable and fixed in a few prompts, similar problems on both agents but some distinct ways of solving it.\n\n\\- After that the API was running, openapi was listing our routes but betterauth routes aren't there, so I instruct them about that and then the nightmare started, while Claude on Cursor manage to fix this in two prompts, Claude on Zed never did, I also give it hints and list the Elysia betterauth docs where there's exactly listed the two piece of codes you need to make it work, but Claude on Zed always wanted to tweak them and either add more code or remove parts of it, in the end I practically told it: \"this piece of code goes here, and this other one goes here, just that.\" to make it works and move on to the next step.\n\n\\- Now both projects were working and showing the betterauth routes on openapi page, but still not capable of sign\\_up and sing\\_in because the mongoose.client that goes into the mongodbAdapter inside betterauth was being instantiated before the mongoose successfully connect to the db, so we needed some kind of singleton around our betterauth instance to handle that, BUT I never explained that to them, it was gonna be too easy right? So I just sent them the console errors about moongose not able to listen the db... Claude on Cursor checked the files and solve it in one prompt, two cause it forget to use the singleton in the authorization middleware. BUT Claude on Zed again never manage to solve that, after dozens of prompts I explained exactly what it needed to do and even after that it poorly implemented something that Claude on Cursor did in the first try, so at this moment I gave up.\n\nTL/DR: I've Tested both agents Claude Sonnet 4.5 on both editors Zed and Cursor with the same tasks, and the inconsistency between them was tremendous, Claude on Cursor nailed it almost every prompt, while Claude on Zed failed to perform the same \"difficult\" tasks.\n\nPS.: Also I was always checking the Zed Claude usage limits on Claude settings page, it has never reached 100% nor dropped to cheap models.\n\nHas anyone gone through something similar and notice these differences? Or am I missing something?\n\nI really want to stuck only with Zed but after all that I'm afraid that I'll spent more time/tokens babysitting Claude than using it on Cursor.\n\nThank you if your read till here, I really appreciate it.",

But nowadays most people , and I'm just assuming, most people generate with agent and review the code manually. When reviewing the code they might fix manually (that's when the autocomplete kicks in) or ask the agent to fix a specific part and then re-verify manually. Human code review is very important but to be able to do an effective review the dev must be an experienced engineer. You can also combine human code review + ai code review.\n\nIn general to answer your question (since im deviating), there is not much to optimize for auto complete, cursor already does that for you based on the files you are opening and recent edits.",

It works so fast that I'll be reading through a line, arrow down but at the same time it will suggest a new completion and before I know it, I've accepted the completion and it removed a bunch of code I needed.

Each model shows the nr of tokens per request. \nIf you run out, you can get 250 tokens more for 10 bucks.\n\nI just tried cursor again and used 33 dollars with only 32 prompts!!! I’m sticking with WindSurf for sure as it’s mostly a very similar experience and I’ve not had any issues in the past 6 months or so.\n\n\nIt’s also worth looking into a Claude Pro sub.\n20 a month and the limit is according to them about 45 messages during a 5 hour window. So unless you do a lot of work during a 5 hour window. It’s basically the best deal you could get for regular use throughout an entire month.\n\nI’m going to give it a try myself and see if it’s a good experience as I would still prefer to work in an IDE.\n\nI also have google Antigravity. However!! The use is very limited unfortunately and the pricing and usage breakdown is even more vague than Cursor.\n\nI used it for a couple of days (a couple of prompts a day) and it said I needed to wait for a whole week to continue using it while on the AI pro plan (on discount for the first 3 months) \nThat was absolutely worthless. So I’ve not used it since to be honest. And while the app is OK. I found it the most buggy by far. It would regularly stop for no reason. It completely stopped working a couple of times and the browser opening and manipulation functionality is very neat but does not work around 40% of the time. All in all I think it still has a lot of work needed to be considered a good and solid experience. In my humble opinion.",

I got $150/usage during that billing period without getting cut off. This month on the $60 tier, I'm up to $102 in usage so far according to the billing and invoices tab.\n\nI don't know if this affects it but I have on demand billing turned off. If I end up getting cut off at some point, I'm going to switch to claude code's $100 max plan and try to use it in cursor, downgrading to cursors $20 plan. Not ready to jump to cursors $200 plan and I mostly just use claude opus, so I think I'd get more bang per buck via claude code max agent instead of cursors at that point.\n\nEdit: Just got cut off at $110.86 this month.

I even have it write my cursor prompts. Does anyone else do this? Has anyone had good luck with Cursor helping guide your project at a higher level? This led me to wonder if the models are billed at a lower rate in Ask and Planning mode. I believe they are right? It would be much easier if I could stay in cursor for more abstract discussions about project direction, talking about features that make sense for a particular industry, etc. More abstract conversations that aren't related directly to code, but lead to code eventually. One drawback is lack of context with Gemini about my codebase. Anyone know of a good way to span that?",

Side note, the pro-plan ($20 / month) is pretty generous and I never usually run out of credits as it refreshes every 5 hours and the weekly limits generous. so context heavy task i offload to Codex and have it write documentatin and note and then handoff to Opus/Sonnet as needed.",

If so, which ones?\n\n\\- Do you rely on custom rules, or mostly defaults?\n\n\\- Any setups that noticeably improved (or hurt) reliability?\n\n\n\nWould be interested to hear what’s working for others.\n\n",

Opus tends to “get it” with much lighter guidance, whereas Sonnet feels more sensitive to both the wording and the structure of rules, especially once project-specific context is involved.\n\nThe point about selectively applying different rule sets per model is interesting , I’ve noticed that trying to reuse a single detailed rules file across models often backfires. Shorter, more explicit constraints seem to work better for Sonnet, even if they’re a bit redundant.\n\nAlso +1 on **Always Apply** for anything critical. I’ve had “Apply intelligently” skip things that were very obviously important, which can be frustrating when debugging why behavior suddenly changed.\n\nOut of curiosity, do you keep those per-model rules completely separate, or do you generate the lighter versions from a shared base and trim them down?",

Other times it completely ignores them. No way to tell if it actually loaded them, decided they weren't relevant, or I messed up the config.\n\n**Don't have a solid approach that works consistently**\n\nI've tried:\n\n* Detailed rules → maybe too verbose?\n* Minimal rules → too vague?\n* Adding examples → helps sometimes\n* Scoping by file type → no idea if that even works\n\nNothing feels reliable. I'll get great results one day, then the same rules seem ignored the next.\n\n**What I want to know:**\n\n**For those who feel like you've figured this out - what's your system?**\n\n1. How do you structure your rules? Short principles vs detailed examples?\n2. How do you know they're actually being applied?\n3. What's been your most effective rule that consistently works?\n4. Different rule sets for different tasks, or one master set?\n5. How do you debug when output doesn't match what you expect?\n\nThe models are powerful enough that **instruction quality** feels like the real limiting factor now. Want to get better at this but keep hitting walls.\n\nUsing Cursor and Antigravity mainly, but curious what anyone's doing across different tools.",
