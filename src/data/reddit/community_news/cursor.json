      "text": "After spending months vibe coding with prior dev exp, I've come to conclusion that:\n\n1. It’s not helping anymore. It’s just straight-up writing 100% of the code. No hand-holding. 2026 has just begun and it's only accelerating.\n2. \"Python dev\" \"React dev\" etc is already boomer talk. Nobody would be hiring for languages anymore. It's about people who can actually solve problems no matter the stack. Language wars are dead.\n3. “Which language should I learn?” is now just a meme. The only skills that still matter: system design, architecture, DevOps, cloud, scaling, observability.\n4. Designers? lol. Figma Make (beta) is already shitting out full brand + UI + production sites that look better than half agencies out there. Idk why I’d keep a full-time designer anymore.\n5. $40/mo cursor used to feel expensive. Now $200/m claude max + 40$/m traycer pro+ feels like dirt cheap. I’d pay more if needed. Upcoming models are gonna make pricing convos irrelevant.\n6. People are shipping full production apps (clean code, launchpad builds, decent ui/ux) within weeks. Not a demo project. Real product generating revenues.\n7. Productivity is completely cooked. Stuff that took months now takes days. Kids growing up soon will replace experienced devs who're taking AI as a joke. We’re watching evolution in fast-forward.\n\nThoughts? I'm sure im not the only one seeing this coming.\n\n*Note: Call it just another \"Is AI replacing devs\" post, but we gotta keep talking to wake the people asleep.*",

More abstraction layers, more integrations, more variables, more moving parts, more complexity. Which always leads to: more problems to solve.\n\nI'm not convinced anything is \"cooked\", and this post just feels like some engagement-bait hyperbole and certainly *is* another \"Is AI replacing devs\" post.",

You need to know how to provide the right context to the LLMs so their prediction tree is going in the right direction. Juniors figure a lot of stuff out by writing code. Experience devs now the solution and implementation ahead.\n\nIf I don't know I research a bit and vibe code it first. Then I a able to decide and provide the right instructions to my LLM.\n\nIn essence I'm the navigator providing input to the pilot. i do tasks in 1 to 2 weeks that would have taken me 1-2 months before.\n\nAlso I have setup our AI SDLC development flow for our devs in a standardize way to fulfill our compliance as we work in a regulated domain.

Not on the first try of course, but good thing we can keep trying until it works, and then keep reviewing until all the models agree.  If time stopped right now, a vibe coder could compile a set of tests, through trial and error, that catches 99% of issues that the most capable coders would today.  \n\nThe cost of running the models that aren't the very top ones is approaching zero.  What do you think will happen when vibe coders command an army of 500 agents that have the capabilities of the top models out now?

Also consistency when project get bigger and bigger, quick example you want refactor a component or service, and connect new refactored items to the flow most of the times you finish with duplicated\n\nif file have 1000-1500 lines codes its already heavy for claude, get lost its not precise anymore so you are forced to split and split everytime your proyect and that ends on duplicated and more complicated to sustain in human eyes\n\ni can keep with the list but at the end the job situation its terrible, never found something like this i dont know how to code i know what i want and how should looks like in front and in the proyect, i know how the structure should be and the database if makes sense for me and its easy to ready and debug in the future, with that no one its calling me (aside from my actual contractor job) \n\nim cheap, im from argentina, i have same time zone than us, solid english, similar culture, high energy, high passion, no one cares. So this will end making my own products and trying to sell it and its a bucle because again whatever i can make its something already made 99% of the times\n\nbtw the example on top its something im building for my brother company: owner drivers and clients connected via track id + chat, owners have a panel with all the cars moving in the city via gps and drivers get the directions and changes the state of \"delivered or not\" with a few more features its pretty much what i want, sounds \"easy\" but its complex, actually complex caching, optimizing, diferent roles, private data, public data, etc etc\n\nIm almost there im just afraid on gps situation but whats the second part where im even more afraid, trying to sell it to 50 years old people who already use pencil and paper, why they would use all digital on mobile, if they want track and know how much km they are doing, the truck already have that and for gps there are even security services who gives you that (or even easier just google maps, its free)\n\nSo being short im grouping 3 or 4 services in one, some are manual other are paid but yea thats the whole situation. Impossible to get a job and super hard to make an actual selleable product specially in my poor country argentina",

Not the kind that leads to playing whack-a-mole with production bugs while pushing hotfixes at 4 AM with a major customer renewal on the line. \n\nTry carrying your train of thought to its logical conclusion and you might understand why code quality and tech debt can't be laughed out of a room. Every single organization I've worked at continuously swings between prioritizing tech debt/code quality and not caring about it at all. No amount of bluster, misunderstanding, or organizational politics can overcome the capability, reliability, and velocity walls that arise from suboptimal engineering processes, flawed architectures decisions, and genuinely shit code.\n\nYou can't accumulate debt infinitely.

The kids all say \"skill issue\" but it is true in this example I think.  Only thing you need is better agents and organizational design.  \n\nYou're describing a system that is light-years ahead of 95% of vibe coders, but you're not describing a problem that isn't already solvable with the tools you are using.  Go back to the code that had the slop left over, and design an agent that will catch that specific slop.  Then ask yourself how to catch that every time?  Were there any issues present that you could deterministically test for?  Can you describe it in words to an LLM, that would decrease the probability that it would repeat next time?  What if you threw a hierarchical team of 10 agents at it, on different LLMs, some you can use for free so it isn't a waste of precious tokens, to check for slop code and to check each other's work and to loop back around until they all agreed? \n\nI would wager a hefty amount that I could design a team of agents that would catch that slop, and any slop similar to it, at a much higher percentage than whatever you have working now does, and I'm 2% the coder it sounds like you are.  That's the sauce now.  Agents checking agents, thinking in abstractions outside of the normal abstractions you're used to, and designing and redesigning your army of agents to reliably one shot more and more complex problems. \n\nYou're able to see the slop, so it is easier for you to fix the code instead of the filter that let the slop through. Mortals like myself have to do it with the tools. \n\nEveryone will catch on soon enough, most of this work is being done in public so the tools will be available for everyone as they improve.  Even if I figure out some secret architecture, it won't last for very long.  The gold rush is right now.  Next year we won't be having this convo, at least not nearly in the same way.",

You need to come from a software (architecture especially) background. You need to plan the application, split it into components and then AI can help you with individual bits. You need to know how system will be designed, what cloud services you will use and how you will connect it all together.\n\nOne thing I learnt here is that  AI can build the entire application for you but then you'll ask for a little change and it can break (or totally change) the entire thing because it does not remember the conversation from last week. \n\n2. You need to know what to ask for. Again software background and you need to assess the output. I really believe that long term it's impossible to use AI without knowing the particular language of the project.\n\nThen comes command engineering. Sometimes you have to give it so many details to fix something (context limits from previous conversations) that you may as well change things yourself quicker. And if you don't specify everything, it starts creating mess, assuming things, introducing some weird elements.\n\nBecause of context limits, code inconsistencies are just crazy. Left over code etc. So you still need to be a programmer I'm afraid and  be in charge of the whole thing. Then AI is actually handy. In source control, you need to make sure you manually verify every file change before you commit anything.\n\nFor me after 15 years of coding, AI is great to automate some boring, repetitive elements of the projects - say I design the architecture, components and I tell it to go and build HTML forms (I always have sample files for AI to look at), some basic react stuff etc, some API endpoints (but I never let it touch DB stuff) - but again, based on my experience, I am able to tell it exactly how it needs to be built. \n\nSo no, you still need to be a programmer to build and successfully manage the project. I agree anyone can give AI a command - \" build me another Instagram\" and you can argue that it took hours instead of months so jobs are going away, but as soon as you start getting serious number of users, reengineering will come and 99% of your AI code will be gone, app will need to be reengineered into multiple services etc.\n\nFor me so far AI was kind of a life saver. I was a bit burnt out in tech sector and was even considering doing something else, but AI brought some excitement. I can actually delegate boring stuff to it that burnt me most and concentrate on more interesting things like making stored procs run quicker etc. I learn so much more now because I have more time for it.",

Back then if someone wanted to get a program or a website created they would need a developer small or big job. And there was plenty of freelance and consulting work of all sizes to go around. But now that has shrunk quite noticeably. There's still a lot of jobs for senior developers that are enterprise and production level. And they're always will be of course. But with less freelance and consultant jobs to go around there is going to be a significant increase in people that will be vying for those same enterprise and production level developer jobs. And of course it's only going to get worse as AI gets better. That's just the reality of it. It'll never fully replace but it will displace a lot of people's job opportunities and project opportunities. Even right now I have clients that want me to do small projects and I just straight up tell them they can just use Google AI studio or lovable to vibe it out. I won't even waste my time.

And it will not write you good performant code for at least a medium-size project. Unless your task is REALLY trivial.\n\n2 - It always was like that. Languages are tools. It's good if you can use one tool for multiple tasks, but sometimes you just need to find a better tool. \"Python dev,\" \"React dev\" is mostly HR BS that doesn't have so much to do with real work.\n\n3 - Incorrect. You should learn languages to write with them. Keep vibe coding and you will smash into a roadblock so huge you HAVE to learn the language yourself to pass it.\n\n4 - AI can't produce good web design. It has a very low ceiling and you will see this ceiling pretty quickly if you keep using AI for design.\n\n5 - I personally unsubscribed from Cursor after 3 months of use and went back to VSCode. Cursor is mostly a waste of time and money.\n\n6 - If you can call \"full production apps\" this buggy mess I see on Upwork in \"we need slight adjustments\" tasks every day - well... It says a lot about your qualifications more than anything.\n\n7 - For people like you there was no competition to begin with. You will be replaced by AI.\n\nHonestly, this whole article just feels like ragebait written by AI.

AI is very good at writing certain classes of software that are traditionally well discussed on the internet. Python + fast API + postgres + react + Http based auth and other web tech are good examples. Lot of people are quick to build a prototype with this stack and come to a conclusion that AI can do everything. \n\nFor example, I tried to build a game using godot and it was gibberish at best. Majority of the critical software that actually make money are built using custom flavors of these frameworks and they are private to each organization. Even with post training, these models are not as good. On top of it, I had huge trouble making Claude (and other AI) work on existing codebases without destroying the structure and idioms followed throughout the project. Sometimes it's okay to write bad code (in terms of structure and style) just so that it's consistent.",

And it's as you said, the skills that will matter a lot doing agentic engineering will be systems thinking/design, arch, cloud, etc etc.\n\nSomething that I think is worth talking about is that you will not succeed if you simply don't know the fundamentals and lack experience. If I didn't start out learning the basics of coding, software engineering etc etc I would not know how to use AI efficiently enough to build an app. Because of my past experience, I know what to ask, where to look, when to jump in when needed. That in of itself is so powerful, and you can learn so much essentially by \"pairing\" with the agent.

So no, I don't think you even need a great UX/UI designer anymore or perhaps instead the definition of what a great UX/UI is has simply changed. Anybody with access to other people's work can now implement similar behavior despite not understanding how the original piece of work was created. You might say well you still need the phenominal human UX/UI designers who created the original pieces of work so the LLMs have something to design from, but I think that is by and large not true. There is enough information fed into these LLMs to hand over a description of the type of UX you want and it will build it in a way that achieves your design specification while automatically considering what is good UX. It's a weird time. For the big companies who want super unique experiences I can see them still paying top dollar for human thinkers, but for so many companies that don't have the capital to hire the best talent well they can hire a much cheaper employee and still get vary satisfactory results.",

Hence, I used to be of the opinion: Well, if you are a really good developer then you can actually effectively use these tools. Now I would consider myself maybe 4/10 in skill level.\n\nThen it daunted on me: I could spend my years to become an 8/10 or even 9/10. But by the time I have done my due diligence to become a pro developer in order to max make use of AI systems, the AI landscape will have changed severely. It's not even a use anymore to become a good developer.\n\n  \nI can't imagine what I could accomplish with a $200/m Claude max and some other agent tools at my disposal. I'll be shitting out super fast, functional, hyper specialized apps for the wildest use cases.\n\n  \nIn any case. I ain't even gonna bother coding anymore.

For them, small tech debt will balloon to a mountain.\n\nAll the good practices we talked about but never did it fully become essential in AI age. Your code base is either clean and free of tech debt, or a mountain of spaghetti code nobody can understand (not even AI can).\n\nI am happy paying $200 for CC and $20 for Codex, working on my dozens of repos because I want to force AI to have clean code boundaries.\n\nI seriously don’t know what it means to the job market.

Idk why I’d keep a full-time designer anymore.\n\nhummmm - ai has gotten much better! it is also writing for me a lot of code, I don't know how to feel about the design part. let me give you a story: for a good part of last year, I was building a speech focused language learning app for myself (to deal with lack of practice partners when I was learning chinese)\n\ni learnt a lot building this project from scratch (was a junior in college, now senior). AI can get you pretty far when you know what you want (architecture, patterns and stuff like that) - first stop: you need to know what you want. he promise of tools like Lovable for me is meaningless above prototyping because at scale you want to know what your software is made of and what are your edge cases (and the outcomes you want). If you do know that, trust me, AI can get you REALLY REALLY far in implementation\n\nSomething that i struggled through during that time was design and what I call \"TASTE\". As the cost to produce software is going down, my requirements for quality, beautiful and amazing UI/UX is going higher and higher as a consumer. I am not gonna use a website that feels \"vibecoded\" (except if the feature is so unique and a killer!) - at some point i realized that my app wasn't good, it has no taste, no amazing UI/UX like Notion or Duolingo and that's why i believe that design is a skill, having taste is amazing because you can then communicate that to the AI (yes gemini 3 is great at frontend but it is only as great as what you tell it to do)\n\nwill the models get better? yes? do i think that AI changed SWE forever, probbaly yes. do i use it a lot? YES - however, you will get the best out of those tools if you possess some underlying skills such as being great at architecturing software and integrations\n\nthose are my 2 cents :)",

For example, you could build a customer portal just for one customer or one project that integrates back to your ERP. If they try to enter garbage, the ERP API controls that and won't let you.\n\nIt may end up being that by reducing the cost of development, more businesses will hire developers, but developers won't be spending hours writing code; they will be designing systems and checking code outputs, testing etc.",

It feels like a lot of people are just trying to make a quick buck on an app nobody actually wants.I wanted to show what happens when you actually go all in.\n\nMe and my co-founder have literally zero software background. We work full-time 9-5 jobs. But we had an idea to fix the car repair industry building a custom OBD2 adapter and an app that explains diagnostics in plain English.\n\nWe didn't just prompt \"make me a car app.\" We have been grinding 24/7 for over a year. We spent thousands of our own money on this. My co-founder dropped €3,000 on an M4 Pro Mac just to handle the iOS compilation speeds. I had to buy dedicated Android hardware because emulators are useless when you’re dealing with live Bluetooth protocols. We had paid for Cursor and burned through the \"Ultra\" fast requests in like 10 days in some months.\n\nThe actual coding was hell. Since there are no good open-source Flutter libraries for what we needed, we couldn't just copy-paste. We had to force the AI to read through boring, 500-page technical documentation on vehicle protocols. We spent weeks just researching the timing differences between K-Line and CAN bus, figuring out PID polling rates, and why iOS Bluetooth handles connections differently than Android.\n\nThe AI would write the code, we’d simulate it, it would work. Then we’d go sit in a freezing car, plug it in, and it would crash immediately because real-world ECUs are messy. We spent Christmas, holidays, and every weekend debugging this stuff while our friends were out.\n\nIf you look at the screenshots, you can see the token usage. Between the two of us, we’ve used about 10 Billion tokens. We built a 300,000-line platform from scratch, handling everything from hardware sourcing to the Next.js web dashboard and the Flutter mobile app.\n\nWe’re finally launching the hardware in Q2 2026. If you want to see what two guys with no degree can build when they refuse to sleep, check it out.\n\n[skanyx.com](http://skanyx.com)",

The Porsche 911 is kind of a long running example of this. \n\nThe thing that has become clear in recent years is that the software side of Apple isn’t listening. The UI for iOS and MacOS was getting worse even before Liquid Glass. People have been begging for a “Snow Leopard release” and to stop focusing on big annual releases - we want iterative improvements. But instead they gave us revolutionary UI changes and also changed the version nomenclature to match the year, which basically locks us into the big annual updates. \n\nThey just aren’t listening.",

I think it would be wise for you to seriously consider how you're going to deploy, maintain, and possibly scale your app, and what you plan to do if you find yourself running a business involving real money that hinges on a product you don't completely understand. To be fair, I don't think any single person could be expected to know all the ins and outs of a code base of that size, but I am absolutely certain your code could be significantly smaller than it is, and that, at this point, it would probably be impossible untangle it into something manageable without a total rewrite.

If we told people \"this will break Tuesday at 2pm\" we'd get sued into oblivion lol.\n\nThe way the feature works is basically looking at the mileage + the specific engine's history. Like in that screenshot with the BMW N47, that engine is notorious for timing chains snapping around that mileage range. So it's less of a prediction and more of a risk assessment telling you \"hey you're entering the danger zone for this specific part on this specific engine.\" It's about data patterns rather than guessing.\n\nRegarding your limp mode issue - that's actually the perfect use case for us. Since you have no codes, a normal scanner is useless. Our app looks at the live data streams (boost, fuel pressure etc) to catch what's out of spec even if the ECU hasn't thrown a light yet.\n\nWould love to hear how it handles your car if you do test it out.",

I export the plans as markdown files, feed it to claude, get my code ready, get it verified (traycer can do simpler verifications, otherwise i go to coderabbit). and the issue doesnt get fixed in one or two iterations, I either manually look into it or open a new claude chat and give fresh context.",

The critique step is key. It usually finds obvious fixes to lift scores from the 65-75 range.\n\nI also love to add to the first step \"do at least 10 web searches as of Dec 26, 2025 (not 2024)\" to ground it in the latest methods/versions/docs, etc.\n\nIf the task is complex or undefined, I like this:\n“Ask me 5 questions (1-5 sentences each) in a numbered list with a, b, c choices”\n\nDo another round if questions were good.\n\nThen:\n“In two paragraphs of 6-8 dense sentences each, restate my requirements in your own words”\n\nAs for what exactly I’m working on - can’t say just yet, a bit stealth but some vanilla JS websites for my business on Cloudflare Workers",

I've played with Antigravity and I do like Gemini 3 for coding, but I don't feel like it's actually any better than Cursor or VS Code with the Claude Code extension.\n\nEdit: I should mention that I don't use AI to do everything - it's great at creating prototypes and bootstrapping projects, but you need a lot of good documentation and clearly defined requirements to keep it on track. I recognize the value of all that (regardless of using AI or not), but I tend to whip up a prototype with AI, then take over as the primary developer to make things work. I'll still use it on occasion, but I don't like writing a bunch of English when I could be writing the code.",

Which is actually a big deal when you buy a product for your company. \n\nI would also say that outside of quota, cursor is generally no worse than antigravity in any way. \n\nNow about quota, while I love antigravity and use it extensively, I find it a little scary that google are undercutting the competition pricing by so much. It feels pretty much impossible for any company to really compete with google at this price level. \n\nLike take opus 4.5, google is one of the providers running it on their hardware. I suppose if you use antigravity with opus 4.5, then google pays anthropic like say X dollar per Y tokens... and then anthropic I guess pays google like 0.6X dollar back for the hardware? They can get tokens quite cheap. Now obviously those hyperscale datacenters weren't cheap to build. \n\nHowever google seems extremely well positioned to become a monopoly power here. Would be healthier to have some different companies like anthropic, openai, cursor reach large scale.",

          "text": "I’m on the ultra plan for Cursor and used my entire quota in a few days (Sonnet 4.5) for complex assistance alongside my own coding. Then I saw Opus was priced similarly to Sonnet 4.5, ended up spending around 1000 on pay per usage and basically smashed Opus. I got a lot done, and the results were far better than Sonnet, so the price felt justified.\n\nBilling cycle came around, fresh quota, but now I’d had a taste for Opus. I used Sonnet and Composer and realised Composer hit about 50% of the mark, Sonnet maybe 80%, and Opus would one shot it. This happened a lot, so I decided to stick to Opus for anything complicated instead of wasting quota on Composer or Sonnet 4.5.\n\nThen I ran out of Ultra quota in about a week - decided to try Google Gemini (free). Used Opus, burned my free quota, swapped Google account, burned the quota again, got the free trial to Google AI Pro, hit quota again. Then I decided to try Ultra for the 3 month contract thing, figured it’s still less than the 1000 I paid Cursor for.\n\nI got the Antigravity extension that lets me track my Opus usage (it works perfectly). I roughly assign 20% usage per hour (it resets every 5 hours), so if I know I have 50% usage left and 2.5 hours left I’m on target. If I have 80% usage left and 3 hours left, I’ll hit Opus harder to catch up with my rough pacing. Works nicely because I can effectively buy more usage by waiting, like going climbing means by the time I’m back I have fresh quota, vs an ever depleting Cursor quota I can’t really track other than token utility in the dashboard.\n\nI’m thinking of cancelling my Cursor Ultra.\n\nFew side notes, Antigravity’s app is a bit broken sometime, it can crash, and it crashed a lot over SSH. I swapped my approach, remote prompts that need access to live DB or debugging happen over SSH, and code edits that I can PR I do on my local machine. That seems to work nicely.\n\nI do prefer cursor's VSC fork IDE, but I can use CLI only, so the nice UI is just a bonus.\n\nJust my two cents :)",

It worked perfectly. Then, yesterday, I asked Cursor to update some metadata logic in that same file, and it completely reverted the code back to the old API key dependency. Broke the whole thing.\n\nSince the AI writes code faster than I can mentally track it, I'm starting to get \"Context Anxiety\" because I don't know what it'll break in the background.\n\n**I built a small script to solve this for myself:** It’s basically a local watcher that tracks every major change (new APIs, removed keys, tech stack shifts) and automatically updates my `.cursorrules` and a `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` file. It’s like giving the AI a long-term memory so it doesn't \"regress\" on me.\n\nI’m thinking about turning this into a proper tool—maybe an MCP server so the memory stays in sync whether I'm in Cursor, Claude Desktop, or a terminal.\n\n**Does anyone else deal with this \"Context Drift\"?** How are you keeping your AI agents from reverting your past decisions? If I made this into a \"set and forget\" CLI that managed your context for you, would you use this application, or is this just a \"me\" problem?\n\nLove to hear how you guys are managing the chaos.",

          "text": "I’ve been solving this problem since before AI. This is exactly the solution to it: [https://markdownpastebin.com/?id=958a3e957ccd4f3e9bdab03fdde0949e](https://markdownpastebin.com/?id=958a3e957ccd4f3e9bdab03fdde0949e)\n\nJoel Spolsky (yes, [the one who founded StackOverflow](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/about-me/)) described this exact problem [back in 2000](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/10/02/painless-functional-specifications-part-1-why-bother/) (and nobody listened to it, I haven't met a single engineer that knows about this article) after dealing with hundreds of real engineers implementing one application — Excel. How do you get hundreds of people aligned on same idea?\n\nYou write a goddamn product spec. Every. Little. Detail. That. Matters.\n\nSo what is the thing I added to this idea? Clear separation between product and technical specs. PFS is to discuss with your product, other stakeholders that don’t have same context as you. Plain English explaining WHAT are you solving and WHY. Modeled after Personas that use this feature and what they can do. If this grows past 1-2 pages it’s already too much scope creep to explain. But 5 lines of text is not helpful either.\n\nAnd now, the actual HOW: failure modes, constraints, infrastructure, budgets, limits, problems you discovered that matter to this problem domain — it’s all TFS, technical boring stuff. But if you didn’t do this analysis you haven’t solved a problem. This file can grow a lot. A simple problem with constraints can become a terrible huge mess. And so what are we doing? We try to break it up into manageable pieces. One tiny problem at a time. Something can be solved with external library. Something we don’t care about (eg supporting Internet explorer 6.0). Something isn’t scope of our problem (linting and code style, making sure app works in electron wrapper).\n\nBut if we don’t capture all of those important details, next engineer that comes after you to work on this exact same feature.\n\nWhat is going to happen?\n\n…\n\nThey have to go and dig into this again. And again. And again. And again. And nobody did this work of properly documenting it before. **And that’s exactly how your context is drifting**. Even with real people with zero AI usage. You know you've been stuck on this specific problem for 3 hours and managed to solve it? **WRITE THAT SHIT DOWN**! So you have **perfect explanation** tomorrow on daily standup why you didn't deliver feature, and you can discuss what to do about it: cut the scope or move the deadline. There's no other way. If you skip this, nobody knows what you did => they assume you've been doing nothing useful.\n\nOkay but what is **metadata.json** about? This is to capture exactly which files and methods belong to your tiny customer facing feature. It’s fingerprint for your feature. Somebody edits file? Good, now they have to read PFS and make sure their change doesn’t break it. If they say „yes, this is up to date” but then feature gets broken you get EXACTLY commit id that breaks it. `git blame` over file shows you. And you see **exactly** when requirements changed over time. And most most importantly — WHY.\n\nI also wrote down one tiny artifact on how to make granular commits that make it further even more easier to explain, commit by commit, why are you bringing changes, and little Context+Why commit body sections: [Note on Git commit messages](https://gist.github.com/konovalov-nk/313ddbbc36b61c7d018be1dbe86a5c24). And you should go and read sources I attached in there ([Tim Pope](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), [Derek Prior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjmw9TRB7s), [Kevin Liddle](https://8thlight.com/insights/mind-your-git-manners), [Caleb Hearth](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message)) that explain why this is important (and even more today).\n\nThat’s it. That’s all you need. Alignment captured in feature specs. Every feature is a granular tiny spec that solves **one** specific problem. **Software engineering is literally connecting those granular specs into one coherent system**. And it’s hard. Genuinely hard to do. Because you are dealing with real world, which is messy. You need to capture why solution you are proposing makes sense. And this is how you ground yourself, your other stakeholders, and your little AI to keep it all together.\n\nDropping my mic 🎤 here 🤣",

Make sure your code (and plan docs) have clear separation of concerns, so as your project becomes more complex, it's easier to review and debug.\n\nAlso:\n\n* Avoid hardcoding keys into your code. Use environment or config files instead, and make sure they’re included in your .gitignore so you don’t accidentally share them. If you’re using service keys that are usage-based (ie not subscription or pre-paid), consider running your project in a Docker container and keeping the keys locally and separate.\n* Re plans, I prefer the agent to create them based on my specifications. That way, I have more control over the file - I can have other agents or models review them and archive them after implementation.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nyp1bxi342bg1.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=019d519b2b287bb22c810fff4ff9f85d1b7c9bad",

I have Claude/Cursor help write custom lint rules, beyond the standard ones, to enforce certain architecture or avoid duplication for example.\n\nIt’s not a silver bullet, but adding these guardrails made it much easier to keep things from drifting as the codebase grew.",

I started working on my own project in early Dec, so plenty of time until the next invoice (Dec 20), right? Well, ever since I started my project, my spending has gone through the roof.\n\nSee the timeline below:\n\n \\- Nov 20: regular $20 invoice, life's good\n\n \\- Dec 1: started working on my project\n\n \\- Dec 14: consumed all the limits, paid $20.04 more\n\n \\- Dec 18: consumed all the limits, paid $40 more\n\n \\- Dec 20: (repeats), paid $20 more\n\n \\- Dec 23: paid $33.03 more\n\n \\- Dec 24: paid $61.09 more\n\n \\- Dec 26: paid $32.31 (switched to Pro+)\n\n \\- Dec 30: paid $81.07 more\n\n \\- Jan 03: paid $101.40 more\n\nMy current on-demand usage is $300 out of a $400 limit (kept raising the limits).\n\nSo, what the actual fk? Yes, I mostly use Opus because other models produce garbage. From time to time, I use Composer just to get some quick fixes done, but Opus is still doing all the heavy lifting.\n\nI tried Claude Code before, but I kept having the feeling that I was losing a mental connection with my code after several sessions, so I switched back to Cursor. I'm not vibe coding. \n\nAny suggestions on how to minimize spending?",

Cursor is trying to help by making their own model, but that takes time.  Composer 1 is a great first attempt.\n\nSecond, don’t rely solely on Opus.  Use Opus to plan, use it to direct lesser models with smaller tasks.  Then use a cheaper model to execute.  Sonnet is very good.  Codex 5.2 is also very capable when directed by opus, and much cheaper than sonnet and opus.  Composer 1 and grok code fast(specifically that model) are both really good at very small tasks, tasks that aren’t hard but burn a lot of tokens because it is monotonous, or easier bug fixing.\n\nYou can also pay $20 a month for Claude code and use it within cursor.  The limits are quite low, so you still want to only use it to plan, but it’s good if you really want to use opus.",

And I find Codex to be very slow.\n\nEither way, if you want to get the most for your money, that’s the play.

I used to use Claude all the time, but every 6 months I re-evaluate because that's how technology works. Things change.  You are blindly sold to a brand that costs more and is actually not the best. Not even close. I'm sorry but I've used claude since 2023 and I loved it. Still like it quite a bit. But by FAR the best is Gemini Pro 3 is great, but even 1.5 pro is super productive and I don't know why you aren't using Auto. People stop with the preconceived notions that you know which one is 'better' or not.  You don't.  It changes too fast. (Sure Gemini can change and has changed over the last year, currently it is great). I just finished an entirely new operating system written in Rust using Auto and a $20 sub.  I did blow through all the 'brands' in 2 weeks.  Kept it going noticed a big quality difference, bumped to the $60 hollar. Haven't had an issue since. I haven't run out of tokens either. Use Auto and the $60 hollar.  If you switch to Kilo Code and use gemini pro 1.5 API you won't ever look back, I've been testing it side by side and am around $40 in usage over the last 30 days. The results? Really very good, it does a little more refactoring but as long as you are paying attention it's a very good replacement.",

          "text": "I work on for a flagship consumer product for a large company that you know and probably have used in the past. Over 10k files in a complex React codebase.\n\nI use Auto and pay $20 a months. Yep I have nearly 30 years experience, but I am lazy and like to lean back and drink coffee and have AI do my work for me, so I only hand code when I get pissed at AI for being a dumbass. But mostly I tell it that it is being a dumb ass and tell it what to fix and how.\n\nIn any case, $20 on auto has been swell. \n\nTips:\n- I use Typescript heavily - everything is well structured\n- All the code has very consistent patterns. \n- Break things down into tiny verifiable parts for the AI to do. Really, know what you want to do code wise in medium brush strokes, and have the AI only have to figure out the little details. Sometimes I like to write some basic skeleton code with comments, and then hand it to the AI like a CS project for it to compete.\n- Really focus on DRY. When the suggested code gets long and unreadable, break it down, shrink it down, componentize it, and make it so easy to read a non-coder would understand it. Don't just see it as done and ship it, actually make it so simple monkey brains can understand what is going on without much effort. When you don't understand what was written, get curious and ask questions, ask for clarification, and when you understand, tell it to make the code in a way that won't need explanation in the future.\n- When you encounter problems, and eventually come up with a solution, ask the AI for bullet points for general information that would have made it get to the solution faster. Add the most meaningful of those to a document that is related to the problem space you were trying to solve, like \"testing tips\" or \"database gotchas\". When you are about to start on something related to that, say what kinda problem space you are working on, and paste in the problem space document. This makes it so you don't hit the same thing too often. Trim this down if it gets too long.\n- Keep context windows small. One small task per chat, get it done, and create a new chat. Have a project file that describes the system and structure and coding rules. Have it read that at the beginning of each chat, and at the end of each chat, ask it what changes should be made after we completed this work - keep the changes small, and have the document pruned on the regular as it will be loaded in at the beginning of a new chat.\n\nIn the end, remember, you are still software engineering. You have to do the engineering. Your brain is important and you have to really engage it. Throwing it in cruise control to the AI will seem great at first but end in a bad blob of bs code. \n\nThe AI codes at a sub-junior level, but enthusiastically so. You have to be there to mentor it to not be a giant fuck up.\n\nYou can throw all the money in the world at your problems, but as has been shown, more investment in LLMs leads to diminishing returns. They can't \"think\" for you. Have them work for you, keep them at medium strength, and learn to guide their hand better. The best upgrade for your model is to learn to drive them better, and if you follow the steps above, you will have a better time and save money.",

If you have a good set of rules (not 10k lines long) and complete everything in small focused tasks, you can vibe code anything.

It's your responsibility to prevent AI slop.\n\nAll of us here switch from opus, to sonnet, to composer multiple times a day.

At times you come up with wrong decisions (which is totally normal) and may want to rollback and refactor. I would typically plan things out with Opus, and then have Opus execute the plan. I sometimes polish a plan for \\~2 hours and it may contain \\~20 todos, but then the results are nearly perfect. It is a large mono-repo, a distributed system with several AWS accounts, several programming languages. I myself work for AWS and do have a fairly high code quality bar. And I am NOT vibe coding.

It's a very intelligent model that loves to make shit up and that could not be more obvious when using it on the gemini chat website or app. But with the cursor harness? It's very reliable. Not as capable as Opus for the heavy stuff, but absolutely a worthy workhorse. I'm honestly surprised it's that good, but I almost want to tell it \"good bot\" sometimes 😭 it's also better than opus at ux/ui (and way better than gemini pro). There is zero point using composer when gemini flash makes it look like grok code (no shade, grok code is impressive, and so is composer, but they lack intelligence) while being so much cheaper at the same time. I'm personally loving it and I would never stop using it for a opus only workflow. Also, sometimes 5.2 xhigh just gets it right the first time and that end up saving you money and time (even though it is slow af). Opus is good at long horizon building tasks, like laying out a huge scaffolding all by itself, but for the finer details it is absolutely not the most efficient model out there to use. Hope that helps!",

Debug mode + C1 helped me to fix bugs reliably where any Antigravity model in agent mode simply failed.\n\nDebug is right now the best reason to stick with cursor. \nThough I also really like C1 for the combo if speed + accuracy in front-end. Not for bigger implementation plans, but fixing stuff quickly, C1 is great. Just...expensive. \n\n",

      "text": "**TL;DR:** Built a tool that lets Cursor remember what it worked on across sessions. Uses lifecycle hooks to capture context and inject relevant history into new chats. Works with free AI providers.\n\n# The Problem\n\nEvery time you start a new Cursor session, your AI has amnesia. It doesn't remember:\n\n* The architecture decisions you made yesterday\n* That weird edge case you spent 2 hours debugging\n* Your project's conventions and patterns\n* Why you structured things a certain way\n\nYou end up re-explaining context constantly, or your AI makes suggestions that conflict with decisions you already made.\n\n# What I Built\n\n**Claude-mem** is a persistent memory layer for Cursor. It:\n\n1. **Captures** tool usage, file edits, and shell commands via Cursor's native hook system\n2. **Extracts** semantic observations using AI (what happened, why it matters)\n3. **Injects** relevant context into new sessions automatically\n4. **Scopes** memory per-project so different codebases stay separate\n\nThere's a local web viewer at `localhost:37777` where you can browse your knowledge base.\n\n# The Big Thing: No Paid Subscription Required\n\nThis was important to me. You can use claude-mem with:\n\n* **Gemini** (recommended) - 1,500 free requests/day, no credit card\n* **OpenRouter** \\- 100+ models including free options\n* **Claude SDK** \\- If you already have Claude Code\n\nMost individual developers won't hit Gemini's free tier limits with normal usage.\n\n# How It Works\n\nCursor has a native hook system. Claude-mem installs hooks that fire on:\n\n* Session start → inject relevant past context\n* User messages → capture what you're asking\n* Tool usage → log MCP tool calls\n* File edits → track what changed\n* Session end → generate summary\n\nContext gets injected via `.cursor/rules/claude-mem-context.mdc` so your AI sees relevant history immediately.\n\n# Installation\n\nThere's an interactive setup wizard that handles everything:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem.git\n    cd claude-mem && bun install && bun run build\n    bun run cursor:setup\n\nThe wizard detects your environment, helps you pick a provider, installs hooks, and starts the worker service.\n\n**If you have Claude Code:**\n\n    /plugin marketplace add thedotmack/claude-mem\n    /plugin install claude-mem\n    claude-mem cursor install\n\n# Platform Support\n\n* **macOS** ✓\n* **Linux** ✓\n* **Windows** ✓ (native PowerShell, no WSL needed)\n\n# What's Captured\n\nThe hook system tracks:\n\n* Tool calls and their results\n* File edits with before/after context\n* Shell commands and output\n* Your prompts and the AI's responses\n* Session summaries\n\nEverything stays local on your machine.\n\n# MCP Integration\n\nFull MCP server with search tools:\n\n* `search` \\- Find observations by query, date, type\n* `timeline` \\- Get context around specific observations\n* `get_observations` \\- Fetch full details\n\n# Links\n\n* **GitHub:** [https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem)\n* **Docs:** [https://docs.claude-mem.ai/cursor](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/cursor)\n* **Changelog:** [https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v8.2.10...v8.5.0](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v8.2.10...v8.5.0)\n\nHappy to answer questions. This started as a tool I built for myself for Claude Code because the session amnesia was driving me crazy—turned out other people had the same problem.",

              "text": "The battle has been won, it is working now. Here is what I had to change to fix everything:\n\n# Claude-Mem Windows/Cursor Fixes\n\n**Date:** 2025-12-30  \n**Version:** claude-mem 8.5.1  \n**Environment:** Windows 10/11, Cursor 2.3.15, PowerShell 5.1+\n\n## Overview\n\nAfter installing claude-mem for Cursor on Windows using `bun run cursor:setup`, the hooks were not capturing sessions. After extensive debugging, we found **5 bugs** in the Windows/Cursor integration that required manual fixes.\n\n---\n\n## Bug 1: Missing Claude Code Directory\n\n**Symptom:** Worker fails to start with error:\n```\nENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\\Users\\Matt\\.claude\\plugins\\marketplaces\\thedotmack\\package.json'\n```\n\n**Cause:** The worker tries to scan for Claude Code plugins even when only using Cursor.\n\n**Fix:** Create the expected directory and a placeholder package.json:\n\n\n    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path \"$env:USERPROFILE\\.claude\\plugins\\marketplaces\\thedotmack\" -Force\n    \n    @\"\n    {\n      \"name\": \"thedotmack-placeholder\",\n      \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n    }\n    \"@ | Out-File \"$env:USERPROFILE\\.claude\\plugins\\marketplaces\\thedotmack\\package.json\" -Encoding UTF8\n    \n---\n\n## Bug 2: Installer Creates Wrong hooks.json for Windows\n\n**Symptom:** After running `bun run cursor:setup`, the `~/.cursor/hooks.json` file points to a `.sh` script instead of PowerShell scripts.\n\n**Bad (what installer creates):**\n    \n    {\n      \"version\": 1,\n      \"hooks\": {\n        \"beforeSubmitPrompt\": [\n          { \"command\": \"./hooks/beforePromptSubmit.sh\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n    \n\n**Fix:** Replace with proper Windows PowerShell configuration:\n\n    {\n      \"version\": 1,\n      \"hooks\": {\n        \"beforeSubmitPrompt\": [\n          { \"command\": \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\.cursor\\\\hooks\\\\session-init.ps1\\\"\" },\n          { \"command\": \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\.cursor\\\\hooks\\\\context-inject.ps1\\\"\" }\n        ],\n        \"afterMCPExecution\": [\n          { \"command\": \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\.cursor\\\\hooks\\\\save-observation.ps1\\\"\" }\n        ],\n        \"afterShellExecution\": [\n          { \"command\": \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\.cursor\\\\hooks\\\\save-observation.ps1\\\"\" }\n        ],\n        \"afterFileEdit\": [\n          { \"command\": \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\.cursor\\\\hooks\\\\save-file-edit.ps1\\\"\" }\n        ],\n        \"stop\": [\n          { \"command\": \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\.cursor\\\\hooks\\\\session-summary.ps1\\\"\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n\n\n---\n\n## Bug 3: `Start-Job` Doesn't Work in Hook Scripts\n\n**Location:** `~/.cursor/hooks/common.ps1` - `Send-HttpPostAsync` function\n\n**Symptom:** HTTP POST requests never reach the worker. Scripts complete but no sessions are created.\n\n**Cause:** `Start-Job` spawns a separate PowerShell process that doesn't complete before the parent hook script exits.\n\n**Bad (original):**\n    \n    function Send-HttpPostAsync {\n        param([string]$Uri, [object]$Body)\n        try {\n            $bodyJson = ConvertTo-JsonCompact $Body\n            Start-Job -ScriptBlock {\n                param($u, $b)\n                Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $u -Method Post -Body $b -ContentType \"application/json\" -TimeoutSec 5\n            } -ArgumentList $Uri, $bodyJson | Out-Null\n        } catch {}\n    }\n    \n\n**Fix (use synchronous request):**\n\n    powershell\n    function Send-HttpPostAsync {\n        param([string]$Uri, [object]$Body)\n        try {\n            $bodyJson = ConvertTo-JsonCompact $Body\n            Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $Uri -Method Post -Body $bodyJson -ContentType \"application/json\" -TimeoutSec 2 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Out-Null\n        } catch {}\n    }\n    \n\n---\n\n## Bug 4: `$input` is a Reserved PowerShell Variable\n\n**Location:** `~/.cursor/hooks/common.ps1` - `Read-JsonInput` function, and all hook scripts that use `$input = Read-JsonInput`\n\n**Symptom:** JSON parsing silently fails, returns empty object.\n\n**Cause:** `$input` is an automatic variable in PowerShell that contains pipeline input. Using it as a regular variable causes conflicts.\n\n**Fix in `common.ps1`:**\n    \n    # Change from:\n    $input = [Console]::In.ReadToEnd()\n    \n    # To:\n    $jsonText = [Console]::In.ReadToEnd()\n    \n\n**Fix in hook scripts (e.g., `session-init.ps1`):**\n    \n    # Change from:\n    $input = Read-JsonInput\n    $conversationId = Get-JsonField $input \"conversation_id\" \"\"\n    \n    # To:\n    $jsonData = Read-JsonInput\n    $conversationId = Get-JsonField $jsonData \"conversation_id\" \"\"\n    \n\n---\n\n## Bug 5: `[Console]::In.ReadToEnd()` Doesn't Work\n\n**Location:** `~/.cursor/hooks/common.ps1` - `Read-JsonInput` function\n\n**Symptom:** `Read-JsonInput` returns empty object even when Cursor passes valid JSON via stdin.\n\n**Cause:** When PowerShell is invoked with `-File`, `[Console]::In.ReadToEnd()` doesn't properly read piped stdin.\n\n**Bad (original):**\n    \n    function Read-JsonInput {\n        try {\n            $jsonText = [Console]::In.ReadToEnd()\n            if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($jsonText)) { return @{} }\n            return $jsonText | ConvertFrom-Json\n        } catch { return @{} }\n    }\n    \n\n**Fix (use ReadLine loop):**\n\n    \n    function Read-JsonInput {\n        try {\n            $lines = @()\n            while ($line = [Console]::ReadLine()) {\n                $lines += $line\n            }\n            $jsonText = $lines -join \"`n\"\n            if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($jsonText)) { return @{} }\n            return $jsonText | ConvertFrom-Json\n        } catch { return @{} }\n    }\n    \n\n---\n\n## Complete Fixed `common.ps1`\n\nHere's the corrected `Read-JsonInput` and `Send-HttpPostAsync` functions:\n\n    \n    # Safely read JSON from stdin with error handling\n    function Read-JsonInput {\n        try {\n            $lines = @()\n            while ($line = [Console]::ReadLine()) {\n                $lines += $line\n            }\n            $jsonText = $lines -join \"`n\"\n            \n            if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($jsonText)) {\n                return @{}\n            }\n            return $jsonText | ConvertFrom-Json -ErrorAction Stop\n        } catch {\n            return @{}\n        }\n    }\n    \n    # Send HTTP POST request (synchronous - Start-Job doesn't work on Windows)\n    function Send-HttpPostAsync {\n        param(\n            [string]$Uri,\n            [object]$Body\n        )\n        try {\n            $bodyJson = ConvertTo-JsonCompact $Body\n            Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $Uri -Method Post -Body $bodyJson -ContentType \"application/json\" -TimeoutSec 2 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Out-Null\n        } catch {\n            # Ignore errors - fire and forget\n        }\n    }\n    \n\n---\n\n## Verification\n\nAfter applying all fixes:\n\n1. Restart the worker: `bun run worker:restart`\n2. Restart Cursor\n3. Check Hooks output channel (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → \"Output: Show Output Channels\" → \"Hooks\")\n4. Send a message in chat\n5. Check http://localhost:37777 — sessions should appear\n\n---\n\n## Files Modified\n\n| File | Changes |\n|------|---------|\n| `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack/package.json` | Created (placeholder) |\n| `~/.cursor/hooks.json` | Replaced with PowerShell commands |\n| `~/.cursor/hooks/common.ps1` | Fixed `Read-JsonInput`, `Send-HttpPostAsync`, `Send-HttpPost` |\n| `~/.cursor/hooks/session-init.ps1` | Changed `$input` to `$jsonData` |\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThese bugs should be reported to the claude-mem maintainers. The Windows/Cursor integration needs:\n\n1. Proper Windows detection in the installer\n2. PowerShell-specific stdin handling\n3. Synchronous HTTP requests (or proper async that waits)\n4. Avoid reserved variable names like `$input`",

The docs site itself was also built using Cursor (heavy use of the native browser feature) and all video coverage in the getting started guide are done in Cursor!\n\n\\*\\*How others can use it\\*\\*  \n\nHelps Cursor tackle big and/or complex projects where context starts to break down.

          "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a large-scale project I've been building with Cursor: **IKAI HR Platform**. It's a comprehensive HR system for analyzing CVs, managing recruitment pipelines, and handling candidate data, currently running in production.\n\n**What I made:** IKAI is a full-stack HR tech platform.\n\n* **Stack:** Next.js 14, Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL (Prisma), Redis, MinIO, and Milvus (for vector search).\n* **Architecture:** It runs on a Native PM2 setup (not Docker) for performance reasons on our specific hardware, with distinct Dev and Prod environments managed partially by AI agents.\n\n**How Cursor Helped (The \"ASANMOD\" Protocol):** This is the most interesting part. Managing such a complex stack alone was overwhelming. So, I used Cursor to build a **meta-system called \"ASANMOD\"** within the project itself.\n\n* **Rule-Based Agent Control:** We created a strict set of markdown rules (`CURSOR.md` , `ASANMOD_MASTER_MANUAL.md` ). When I start a session, the Agent reads these first. It acts as a \"Sentinel,\" refusing to break rules like \"No direct commits to Prod\" or \"Always run verify script before push.\"\n* **Automated DevOps:** We built scripts that the Agent can run (`npm run verify` , `deploy-prod`  logic). The Agent handles the deployment pipeline: checks git cleanliness, switches to Prod environment variables (handling localhost vs docker hostnames automatically), runs builds, and reloads PM2 services seamlessly.\n* **Context Awareness:** Using Cursor's context features (`.mdc`  files), the Agent knows exactly where the Nginx configs are, how the backend proxy handles CV downloads (to avoid CORS/Mixed Content), and how to sanitize filenames for MinIO storage without me explaining it every time.\n\nIt feels like pair programming with a Senior DevOps Engineer who memorized the entire documentation. I focus on the product logic; Cursor/ASANMOD handles the system integrity and deployment safety.\n\n*(Note: English is not my native language. This text was prepared with the help of my AI Agent within Cursor, just like the project itself!)*",

I spent time using Antigravity and Claude Code, and while I fully understand that almost anything outside of Cursor can be cheaper, I found myself constantly fighting the tools and never feeling fully confident about what was actually happening.\n\nWith Cursor, everything just clicks. I can’t fully explain what it is. The UX, the flow, the editor integration. It’s spectacular. I genuinely wish there were a cheaper alternative at the same level of quality, but right now there simply isn’t. Cursor is worth every cent, and after trying alternatives, I appreciate it more than ever. For me, it’s clearly the best code editor available today.",
