      "text": "We reviewed +40 vibe coded MVPs the last month. Most vibe coded apps dont fail because the idea is bad. They fail because the transition from “it works on my laptop” to “real users depend on it” never happens. AI makes building cheap. It also makes bad decisions scale faster\n\nHeres the roadmap I wish every non tech founder followed before they reached out to us to clean their mess:\n\n1. pick what you’re building and freeze it early\n\nYour biggest enemy is not bugs. It’s mutation. AI preserves output, not intent. If you keep re-prompting a feature that already works, you’ll eventually “fix” it into a new bug.  \n\nRule: working + users happy = frozen. New ideas go into a separate sandbox, never into live logic\n\n2. draw 3 boxes before you write anything\n\nMost production problems come from mixing concerns. Before you build write this on paper:\n\nfrontend (screens)  \n\nbackend (rules)  \n\ndata (truth)\n\nIf the AI starts putting business logic in the UI or storing “truth” in random client state, stop and correct it. This one habit prevents half the rewrites\n\n3. treat your database like it’s already at 10k users\n\nThe silent killer is db drift. AI “fixes” by duplicating. Founders accept it because everything still looks fine. Two weeks later, nothing is reliable!!\n\nSimple rules that save you: one concept lives once, avoid duplicate fields for the same idea, be intentional about nulls, and if you filter/list it often, index it. If you cant explain your core tables in plain words, you’re not ready to add features\n\n4. never let AI do migrations on autopilot\n\nAI is great at adding new fields but Its terrible at safe evolution. It will create “userId2” instead of fixing userId.. it will nest instead of relate.. it will bypass constraints instead of respecting them. Data structure changes should be slow and rare. Screens can change daily. The data model shouldn’t!\n\n5. build async early so your app doesn’t die on day 10\n\nAnything that can take time should be a job not a request. Pdf parsing, AI analysis, video generation, imports.. If your app relies on “one request does everything” it will break the first time users refresh retry or spike\n\nQueues aren’t overengineering but they’re how you stay alive under load\n\n6. count LLM calls like money because they are money\n\n90% of the founders get traction and then panic when the bill arrives. You should know the cost of one core action before you go viral.. Do this early: log every call with user id and reason, cap calls per user and per minute, cache results, never trigger LLMs on page load by default. if you dont know cost per active user, growth is not a win, its a liability\n\n7. design failure before success\n\nAsk boring questions now so you dont melt later. What happens if stripe fails? if the user refreshes mid action? if the job runs twice? if the api times out?? If your plan is “ai will fix it” you’re building anxiety not a product. Production readiness is mostly boring resilience\n\n8. separate experiment from production like your business depends on it\n\nBecause it does. Vibe coding is amazing for experiments but experiments leaking into live flows is how you get “we need a full rewrite”\n\nHave a sandbox branch, a staging environment, or at minimum a feature flag mindset. Test changes away from paying users. Deploy intentionally\n\n9. use AI as a reviewer before using it as a builder\n\nThis is underrated. before you tell AI “change this” ask: explain this flow, what depends on it, where does this data come from, what breaks if I remove it\n\nYou’ll catch hidden coupling, dead code, and data side effects before you ship them\n\n10. the last 20% is the real SaaS\n\nThe first 80% is getting something that works.. the last 20% is what makes it survivable. Edge cases, permissions, retries, logs, onboarding clarity, predictable billing, and performance. Thats what creates trust and thats what keeps users!\n\nthe vibe coder mindset shift you need to understand: You’re not “not technical.” You’re becoming a product engineer. Your job is not to write code but to make good decisions!!\n\nand  if you’re already past validation and want a second pair of eyes on your setup im always happy to take a quick look or just tell me which part scares you the most right now and why?",

If you can’t describe your core tables, main jobs, and what happens when Stripe/LLM/DB flake out, you’re not running a SaaS yet, you’re running a demo.\n\nAlso worth adding: track real user behavior and rants early. I use PostHog for funnels and Sentry for “how on earth did that 500 happen,” and Pulse for Reddit to catch the “this app is sick but keeps timing out” comments before churn shows up in Stripe.\n\nThe move from “it works” to “I can sleep through a traffic spike” is exactly this: freeze what works, evolve data slowly, price LLM calls, and rehearse failures as seriously as features.",

Better than auto in my opinion.  \nThe cost of Composer-1 slots in between Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5.  \nHonorable mention is GPT- 5.1 Codex Mini. Better than Haiku 4.5 but under Sonnet 4.5 in my experience.\n\nI know others will probably chime in about Grok & Gemini, and while I do agree Gemini tends to be better at planning than Claude models, I've not had much luck using Grok or Gemini executing in my particular coding projects. Claude has been less finicky for my use cases.\n\nI mostly flip between Sonnet 4.5, Composer-1, and Auto mostly depending on what I'm doing, then bump to Opus 4.5 whenever one of those really struggles with bug fixing or if I'm planning out a new feature set and need it thoroughly documented first to feed it into one of the lesser models to execute.\n\n|Name|Input(per 1M)|Cache Write|Cache Read|Output|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Claude 4.5 Haiku|$1|$1.25|$0.1|$5|\n|Claude 4.5 Opus|$5|$6.25|$0.5|$20|\n|Claude 4.5 Sonnet|$3|$3.75|$0.3|$15|\n|Composer 1|$1.25|$1.25|$0.125|$10|\n|GPT-5.1 Codex|$1.25|$1.25|$0.125|$10|\n|GPT-5.1 Codex Max|$1.25|$1.25|$0.125|$10|\n|GPT-5.1 Codex Mini|$0.25|$0.25|$0.025|$2|\n|AUTO|$1.25|$1.25|$0.25|$6|\n\nI know most people just gloss over their model pricing page, but these prices are important because they make up the 'burn rate' of your monthly usage depending on what plan you use. The more expensive the model, the faster you'll burn through the usage. Also, using the high/thinking version of a model has an additional tax that increases the burn rate since it will use more tokens. Max mode also adds around 20% more than the base model. Try to avoid using the thinking version(Has a pic of a brain next to it in the model drop down list) and Max modes when you can.\n\n\\[UPDATED\\] Recreated the table so its easier to read, added additional context + comments. Manually added \"AUTO\" model to table because its not available on the Cursor model pricing page(not sure why). Its pricing its towards the bottom of the main pricing page.",

              "text": "So.... yes. I think in general, and for 95% of use cases, Auto is probably fine for most people. To be fair, this is using Auto vs Opus on probably the most complex project in my coding career. There are multiple packages with independent and differing concerns, used as dependencies. There is a lot of iterating on logic that involves instances of nodes in a tree. So, Cursor's debug mode will be like, \"Cool, I logged something in this line of code and I'm showing it's getting X result.\" And I'm like, \"Uh, nope, you are not separately tracking node indexes and tracing a path for a particular instance; multiple node types go through that line of code, as do multiple instances of one type of node.\" - In my experience thus far, Cursor / LLMs in general have a really hard time understanding or debugging recursion. (To be fair, so do humans.) Cursor seems to often assume, \"I logged something happening at that line of code, so that must be what always happens, so I can make broad generalizations from it.\"\n\nI think my biggest gripe is-- I don't know what instructions Cursor is giving LLMs for debugging, but I often get the sense that whatever is in that \"debug mode\" prompt, in general, misunderstands what good debugging actually looks like. Maybe that's just a flaw in LLMs in general-- their sort of \"prediction\" model means they just inherently make guesses instead of forming good hypetheses, and testing assumptions systematically. Way too many times, I've had \"Auto\" mode say, \"Aha! This is the bug!\" And it starts rapidly making code changes while I spam the stop button and tell it to stop for the love of god because it's not even CLOSE to understanding the bug, nor did it make any attempt to try, even if I've very explicitly asked for a measured, systematic approach, and even if I've asked it to summarize before making changes.",

I pay for the $60 plan and can get about a week of work out of it with Opus 4.5 (and that is being generous). Some times I can only go 2 days without going over the limit. It just depends on the work. Then in order to get more done, you pay more and more. I’ve spent upwards of $200-300 in a month. Compare that to Claude Code where I could spend $100 and virtually never hit the limit. I still prefer the Cursor experience these days, but it may be worth looking elsewhere.\n\nEdit: it’s important to keep in mind this example is leveraging the Opus 4.5 exclusively. I prefer to work with this model because it works so well. You can get enormously more usage using other models.\n\nEdit: Addressing your comment about Opus flailing on your project, I feel there may be an issue with your workflow.

Including full automatic deployment script and nightly backup and a full project documentation — took about two weeks of like 2-4 hours work each day, and I am pretty happy with the result. I‘ve limited the agent to Gemini-Flash-3 and it could deal with all issues easily, fulfilled all my special UI requests neatly and even made some great suggestions on some additional polishing (and I am still a bit flashed by the general oversight of the agent, thinking of three other places to adapt things that I only looked at in one specific area…). \nUsage costs so far is like 60€ (which I think is a joke given the work that went into it, the amount of code that was produced and the final functionality being delivered), so 40€ beyond the Pro limit, but I didn‘t quite understand the dashboard, because so far all is displayed as „included“ and my on-demand budget is still untouched…",

I have added cursor rules to use a specific ui kit and write it in my prompts too, and it still manages to write custom garbage code.\nMy struggle is it sometimes does a heavy lifting in just a couple of hours on a new big functionality and then it takes way more time fine tuning the edges.\nI guess if I was working on a paid project I would still use it, but can’t decide whether I want to spend 100s of $ for using it on a side project",

Early in the readme, it instructs the LLM to keep these 2 files up to date when things are discovered. Today, Opus 4.5 discovered a new thing, and didn't update the Readme. I asked it why, and it apologized and said how it got distracted and would do better next time. I then noticed it didn't update the mistakes doc about that documentation mistake it made and asked why, and it said:\n\n>You're absolutely right. That's embarrassingly meta - I made a mistake about not documenting mistakes, talked about that mistake, and then failed to document the mistake about documentaing mistakes in the document specifically designed for documenting mistakes.\n\nThen in the mistakes doc, it added this funny chunk:\n\n    **Ironic Note:** This very mistake was added to this document only after the user \n    pointed out that the AI forgot to document its own forgetfulness about documentation. \n    Don't be that AI.\n\n**\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*** By popular request, here's a sanitized copy of the first 50 lines of my Mistakes To Not Repeat file:\n\n    # Mistakes To Not Repeat 🚫\n    > **Purpose:** This document catalogs common mistakes that AI assistants should avoid when working with this project. Learn from past errors!\n    ---\n    ## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Read This First\n    **Before doing ANY work in this workspace, AI assistants MUST:**\n    1. **Fully read** `Internal_System_Documentation.md`\n    2. **Fully read this document** (`Mistakes_To_Not_Repeat.md`)\n    3. **Keep both documents updated** - If you make a mistake or discover a new gotcha, ADD IT to this document immediately so future sessions don't repeat it.\n    These documents exist because AI assistants have repeatedly made the same mistakes. **Your job is to learn from them AND improve them.**\n    ---\n    ## 🎯 Workflow Preference Violation\n    ### ❌ CRITICAL: Don't Default to Windows - Use SSH!\n    **The owner's strong preference:** Always SSH to Linux machines first. Windows is a **last resort**.\n    **Wrong approach:**\n    ```powershell\n    # Trying to do everything from Windows PowerShell\n    $headers = @{\"X-Api-Key\" = \"key\"}\n    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri \"https://radarr/api/v3/movie\" -Headers $headers\n    # Or trying to use Windows tools for file operations\n    Get-Content Y:\\radarr\\config.xml | Select-String \"ApiKey\"\n    ```\n    **Correct approach:**\n    ```powershell\n    # SSH first, then use superior Linux tooling\n    ssh nuc\n    # Now on Linux - use proper tools\n    curl -s -H \"X-Api-Key: KEY\" \"http://radarr/api/v3/movie\" | jq '.[] | .title'\n    grep ApiKey /radarr/config.xml\n    docker logs radarr --tail 50\n    ```\n    **Why NUC SSH is preferred:**\n    - **Arch Linux** with modern kernel (6.12+) and up-to-date tooling\n    - Linux tools (`curl`, `jq`, `grep`, `awk`, `sed`) are more powerful\n    - Docker only runs on the NUC\n    - **Synology files accessible via NFS** at `/mnt/synology/`\n    - Consistent paths (no `Y:\\` vs `/home/me/` confusion)\n    - Scripts are designed for Linux\n    - API calls are simpler with `curl` than PowerShell\n    **Why Synology SSH is a fallback, not primary:**\n    - Older kernel (4.4.x) with limited capabilities\n    - Fewer tools installed - many common utilities missing\n    - Strange Synology-specific Linux configs\n    - **Only use for permission issues** that require direct NAS access\n    **When Windows is acceptable:**\n    - IDE file editing via Samba shares\n    - Quick file browsing\n    - When SSH is genuinely unavailable\n    ---",

          "text": "They usually give you some extra usage for free, but nobody knows how much. I have gotten $60 worth of tokens for $20 before.\n\nOnce you run out, here are some options to continue using AI for coding that I have used:\n\n* upgrade to $60: triples your limit. Ok-ish deal.\n* use auto mode: only works if you are very pain tolerant or don't have a lot of prompt complexity\n* pay-as-you-go: you set a limit, then Cursor charges you. Probably the worst deal since you don't get any \"free\" tokens, but can be tolerable for low limits.\n* use Claude code cli: $20 / month for regular usage of Claude models (sonnet, opus). Good deal if you need more access to the strongest models. Resets every 5h with a weekly limit. Claude cli is an extension to cursor that integrates reasonably well.\n* antigravity: $20/month for a separate IDE. Google's AI solution with access to Gemini and a small Claude code contingent. Good solution if you don't mind a second IDE and can deal with Gemini. Bonus: paid Gemini access on web/app -- which is probably better than chatgpt, so it's a reasonable all-around extra solution. (Though I personally hate Gemini models)",

They are amazing for the complex architecture and design plans and deep analysis that other models fail at.\nBut those models are overkill for smaller, less complex changes, or even executing a medium complex implementation plan.\n\nAlso, you have both a 5h windows and a weekly window. So if you used up 100% in your 5h limit, you used up possibly 10-20% of your weekly limit.\n\nIf you rely on Claude models, Claude Code is the way to go.",

      "text": "I spent some time digging into the internal config and realized Cursor actually has a pretty powerful hooks system at `~/.cursor/hooks.json`. Unlike Claude Code (which basically only lets you hook into the end of a session), Cursor gives you access to 7 different lifecycle events that fire in real-time.\n\nThe ones I’ve found most useful are `afterAgentThought` and `afterShellExecution`. By setting these up, you can pipe the context of what the agent is doing to a logging script.\n\nThe configuration is straightforward. You point it to a script that accepts JSON via `stdin`. Here’s how I have my `hooks.json` set up to capture everything:\n\nJSON\n\n    {\n      \"version\": 1,\n      \"hooks\": {\n        \"afterAgentThought\": [\n          { \"command\": \"python ~/.cursor/hooks/keywordsai_hook.py\" }\n        ],\n        \"afterShellExecution\": [\n          { \"command\": \"python ~/.cursor/hooks/keywordsai_hook.py\" }\n        ],\n        \"afterFileEdit\": [\n          { \"command\": \"python ~/.cursor/hooks/keywordsai_hook.py\" }\n        ],\n        \"afterMCPExecution\": [\n          { \"command\": \"python ~/.cursor/hooks/keywordsai_hook.py\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n    \n\nThe real benefit here is the granularity. Since it’s event-based, my dashboard shows exactly when the agent paused to think, which files it touched, and the exact output of the terminal commands it ran.\n\nI ended up with hierarchical spans that look like this in my traces:\n\n* **cursor\\_abc123** (38.9s)\n   * ├── **Thinking 1** (0.5s) - \"Let me analyze the code...\"\n   * ├── **Edit:** **utils.py** (0.1s)\n   * ├── **Shell: npm test** (4.1s)\n   * └── **Thinking 3** (0.2s) - \"Tests passed\"\n\nIf you're building complex features where you need an audit trail of what the AI did to your code, this is the way to do it. It’s way better than just scrolling back through the chat history.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bbxcy4pj8edg1.png?width=2292&format=png&auto=webp&s=d020b3e3f02b59aa6f7d5dd561808b7eb9333dae\n\n",

Never run high-reasoning models without planning as Gemini would loops and GPT-5 series would rushes bad solutions.\n\n**If you want to skip planning / steer yourself / set & forget:** Sonnet or Composer 1 as a middle ground.

Does it being integrated in the IDE itself allow it to have more context awareness capabilities on its own? I’m also curious because the best contender to cursor I’ve found has been windsurf, also a vscode fork (non-extension), while other extension based ones I’ve tried such as Codex have also had this issue with context\n\nI’m aware it’s the same model, I’m just curious if cursor builds something into their IDE that gives it a leg up on auto context?

There is claude pro which gives you more opus prompts, there is antigravity which gives you more opus prompts...
