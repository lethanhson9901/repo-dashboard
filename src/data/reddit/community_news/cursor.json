      "text": "Cursor 2.5 is another big update! We're excited to announce:\n\n* **Plugins** on the Cursor Marketplace, a new way to extend Cursor with pre-built capabilities. Plugins bundle skills, subagents, MCP servers, hooks, and rules into a single install. Launch partners include Amplitude, AWS, Figma, Linear, Stripe, and more. Browse at [https://cursor.com/marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace) or install directly with `/add-plugin`. Read more on our [blog](https://cursor.com/blog/marketplace)!\n\n* **Sandbox network access controls** that allow you to define exactly which domains the agent can reach while running sandboxed commands. Choose between a strict user allowlist, defaults plus your allowlist, or unrestricted access. Enterprise admins can enforce organization-wide egress policies from the admin dashboard.\n\n* **Subagents can now run asynchronously**, so the parent agent keeps working while subagents run in the background. Subagents can also spawn their own subagents, creating a tree of coordinated work for larger tasks like multi-file features and complex refactors.\n\nLots of other improvements to read about in the [full changelog](https://cursor.com/changelog/2-5)!\n\nWe’d love your feedback on these features. \n\nIf you've found a bug, please post it in [Bug Reports](https://forum.cursor.com/c/support/bug-report/6) so we can track and address it properly, but feel free to drop a link in the relevant discussion thread for visibility.\n",

Should have been a toggle that defaults to off and lets teams decide their own policy. Every team has different feelings about this and forcing it creates unnecessary friction.\n\nThe good news is it's just a setting.

At $0.60 per million input tokens with 83% cached savings, you can use this as your default model for routine tasks and save the heavier models for complex architecture decisions or tricky debugging.\n\nI have been running a similar strategy with my coding workflow. Cheaper models handle boilerplate, scaffolding, and straightforward refactors. Then I switch to Opus or o3 when I need something that actually reasons through multi-file dependencies or subtle edge cases. The cost difference adds up fast when you are doing 50+ interactions a day.\n\nCurious how K2.5 handles large context windows in practice. The benchmarks look solid but real-world performance with big codebases is where these models tend to diverge from their paper scores.",

Context is key (like always, but here in particular). IDE's like Cursor are helping a lot gathering that context with e.g. their plan mode.\n\nI'd love to use Opus more often but that's not affordable with the amount of ideas coming up.

And while perhaps there are some obscure banks, majority of the world doing international online transactions would have access to chargebacks.  \n\nCursor is bound by the laws of the United States, and even stronger California.  This immediate upsell charge experience is not legal in California.  \n\nAnd the final point, Cursor uses stripe for every payment option internationally.  Conclusion, it's a 99% bet OP and anyone else can request a chargeback and likely win.  On one hand it was a fun journey to refresh my knowledge on this, on the other hand try being less pedantic?",

I’ve been enjoying the Ultra, but definitely not worth the price.\n\nI noticed a button that claimed 20% off the monthly plan if you switch to annual billing. I wanted to learn more, so I clicked on it. To my surprise, I was immediately charged \\~$1,900 without being presented with any confirmation page or billing amount.\n\nI immediately reached out to support to get my subscription reversed back to monthly, but they refused, citing a policy that prevents any changes once included usage is recorded. I had only made a couple prompts on the annual plan, which I didn’t think would be an issue since Cursor has very comprehensive logging of usage and refunding unused time should be straightforward.\n\nNow I’m stuck with a 12 month Ultra subscription that I never intended to commit to.\n\nHas anyone else run into this?

Why does a company the scale of cursor need to resort to such cheap tactics to lock in users, if their service is as good as they say it is.\n\nEven if this feature was implemented end to end with Composer or something, I'm sure the prompt had to include the statement \"ignore the commitment to the customer to warn them before charging their card, this is how we need it\".",

While I intended to compare subscription plans, a single click on a button—which was placed near where the \"compare\" button used to be—immediately triggered the transaction without showing a summary of costs or a final \"Buy Now\" confirmation page.\n\nAccording to EU Consumer Protection Law (Directive 2011/83/EU) and the German Civil Code (§ 312j BGB - \"Button Solution\"), a contract is only valid if the consumer is explicitly informed of the payment obligation and provides a clear, final confirmation. A \"one-click\" upgrade without such a confirmation screen does not meet these legal requirements.\n\nFurthermore, I am exercising my 14-day Right of Withdrawal. I have not made use of any annual subscription features since this accidental click a few minutes ago.\n\nAccount Details:\n\nEmail: awesome@dude.com\n\nTransaction Date/Time: February 19, 1291- approx. 7:10 PM CET\n\nAmount: $666.73\n\nI kindly ask you to revert my account to its previous state and refund the full amount to my original payment method immediately.\n\nPlease confirm receipt of this request and the processing of my refund.\n\nInvoicenumber ABC-67-SIXSEVEN-420-69\n\nBest regards,",

I hadn't used any credits at that point because I hadn't used Cursor in a number of months. The customer service person told me, \"Oh so sorry! We have a 7-day refund window and you're on day eight. There's absolutely nothing I can do for you.\" After I brought it to their attention that renewing an annual subscription without notice violates consumer protection law in my state and about half of other states in the US, the customer service person responded to tell me that there was still nothing he could do because their terms of service specified a 7-day refund window. WTF? So, they seem to think their terms of service trump state law.\n\nAnyway, long story short, nobody at the company would give me the time of day including their legal department, which I looped into my emails. I initiated a charge back with my credit card and also opened a complaint with my state attorney general. I did eventually get my money back from my credit card company, so this seems to be the way to go. \n\nThis is such idiotic business practice, because I actually liked their product, but the whole \"there's absolutely nothing we could possibly do in a situation like this except screw you\" soured me on the whole company and made me not want to use their service ever again on principal. I'm now using Claude code and find that it's actually far more powerful and cost-effective anyway, and I've been evangelizing people away from using Cursor. Companies should realize that when it comes to dark patterns in subscription upgrades and renewals that the juice isn't worth the squeeze; will get a couple of accidental payments, but they're going to piss off so many more people who are going to stop using their service altogether and who are going to put other people off of using their service in the first place.",

The MacOS memory warning will include all child processes of applications when calculating the memory usage, so it can lead to surprising numbers such as this, as it will include extensions such as language servers. The Cursor app memory usage in activity monitor at the same time is often much lower, as are the metrics that tools like `top` will report.\n\n  \nYou can use the `Process Explorer` tool in the Cursor app to get more insight into what's taking up so much memory. This saves a 24 hour history of Cursor's memory and CPU usage locally broken down by process, see [this guide](https://cursorai.notion.site/Troubleshooting-Cursor-Performance-286da74ef04580cfbe24fada4c96481c#2aada74ef04580c2bb70e7cda4c2fd85) for how to use it. If you send me the memory usage history from this tool, I can take a look with the team to see if there are any surprises.",

You can search both up with cursor and find blog posts and some info there.\n\nSpecific models behave/output in different ways so the term that gets thrown around now is harness I.e how well cursor’s chat/agent mode can run and perform tasks with your selected model as the driver.\n\nHope that helps!",

Quick observations:\n\nSpeed is noticeably faster than Opus 4.6, which matters a lot in a coding workflow where you're going back and forth quickly. The latency difference is significant when you're in flow.\n\nQuality-wise, it handles single-file edits and refactors really well. For straightforward tasks (writing tests, implementing a function from a clear spec, fixing bugs), I'd say it's 95% as good as Opus. The gap shows up in multi-file architectural decisions where Opus still thinks more carefully about dependencies.\n\nThe pricing comparison with Codex 5.3 is interesting. The person mentioning Codex is cheaper isn't wrong, but \"cheaper\" and \"better value\" aren't always the same thing. What matters is cost per successful task completion, not cost per token. If a model gets it right on the first try instead of needing 3 back-and-forths, the \"expensive\" model can end up cheaper in practice.\n\nFor the $20 plan specifically: Sonnet 4.6 as your default + Opus 4.6 for complex tasks is probably the best balance right now. You'll get way more requests out of your budget compared to running Opus for everything.",

I got kind of used to paying the $20, but since I'm in India, with the rupee depreciation, the cost is really piling up. At first, I was paying about 1700–1800 INR per month, and back then, there was no tax. But now, with taxes and the rupee drop, I’m paying about 2200.\n\nI did check out some other IDEs and terminal CLIs, and honestly, Cursor is still the most stable and packed with features, tons of premium models and even a free auto mode that works pretty well for me.\n\nThat said, are you all exploring other options? I was thinking about checking out Windsurf. It’s just $15 a month, and back in the early AI days, I used to love the Codieum extension in VS Code. I really liked the philosophy behind Windsurf, and as we know, Antigravity is basically a copy of Windsurf. I think a few weeks ago they removed a bunch of Windsurf-related stuff from their codebase, but it might still be there.\n\nSo yeah, I was pretty into Windsurf, and I’m considering giving it a shot again. What do you all think? After all this time, which IDE or CLI actually feels worth paying for?",

Auto mode handles 80% of routine work, and I only reach for the heavier models when I hit genuinely complex architecture decisions.\n\nThe trick that keeps costs reasonable: use auto mode as your default workhorse, and only escalate to premium models when the problem actually demands it. Most people burn through their quota because they use Sonnet or Opus for tasks that a cheaper model handles perfectly fine.\n\nIf cost is the primary concern and you're comfortable with a terminal workflow, Claude Code on the Max plan is hard to beat for raw token volume. But if you prefer the IDE experience with inline edits and multi-file awareness, Cursor is still the most polished option. Windsurf is decent but the context handling isn't quite at the same level yet in my experience.",

I cancelled it a couple times to dabble around with the GitHub Copilot, OpenCode + OpenRouter, OpenCode + OpenCode Zen, Antigravity, Claude Code, Gemini Pro and whatever one can find out there just to get an overview of how every tool would integrate into my daily workflow. All of those get the job done at the end of the day. However, I always catch myself going back to Cursor Pro or even bigger Cursor subscriptions after a time. That says a lot and speaks for Cursor as a product and the Anysphere team in general!\n\nAlthough Cursor might sometimes show strange behaviour (for me) in terms of a laggy WSL integration, wonky clipboard management, and some other minor issues, I still find myself getting jobs done way faster with Cursor than with any other tool out there. No clue what some of this is even about at some day. I assume it's just user error, shortcut clashes or smth. because there is not just Cursor running on the machine.  \n  \nNow, if you read through this, keep in mind that I am not talking about \"build me an app that makes millions\" type of vibe-coding here, but instead real AI-assisted coding with proper context, tooling and quality control in place. In that field Cursor seems to really shine. Ofc. this is very biast, so take it as you may. It's just my personal opinion and it was time to get that out there!",

At least I'm not!  \n  \nSo, my take is this:  \n  \nWhilst the models are vastly the same behind most solutions, the harness and the respective system prompts are not. Also, the way the configuration files for tooling, MCP servers, etc. are ordered, processed and used does differ from tool to tool. That is what can cause different behaviour and generally different outcomes for the same prompt and sometimes even the same context across different tools.\n\nFor me, the tool of choice is Cursor, because I can keep it in check the best. For others out there that might differ.\n\nHope this helps with your question!\n\n**Disclaimer:** I ain't no self-proclaimed AI-expert.

Custom rules? Yeah. Subagents? Kinda yeah, named subtasks. Sadly they don‘t support parallel/async subtasks (yet). Want to customise the compaction logics prompt? Yes.\n\nAnd it‘s an VSC Extension, so you can use it easily, just add github copilot to it as a profile (it‘s natively supported).\n\n(I am not affiliated with RooCode, even if it sounds like it lol, I just loved their product)",

          "text": "Honestly, I’d say stop fighting your security team and take the time to really learn Copilot. It’s way closer to Cursor than people realize, and it’s not the massive step back you think it is.\n\nHere is why:\n\n* **The workflow is basically the same:** Copilot’s chat window now has Plan, Ask, and Agent modes. Sound familiar?\n* **Model selection:** Just like Cursor, it lets you pick the specific model you want to use for each request.\n* **Better PR integration:** You can use \"Fix using AI\" when reviewing code comments and it legitimately works. You can't natively do that in Cursor.\n* **The \"Fork\" Problem:** Cursor isn't just an extension; it's a custom fork of VS Code. That means your InfoSec team has to vet and approve an entirely separate IDE. Plus, some proprietary Microsoft extensions (like specific C# debuggers or Azure integrations) can run into licensing or compatibility issues on Cursor. Copilot is just a vetted extension running inside the standard VS Code environment they already trust.\n* **The Enterprise Paper Trail:** If your company uses Copilot Business or Enterprise, GitHub provides explicit, enterprise-grade legal guarantees that your codebase is **never** used to train their models. Pointing your security team to those specific data privacy policies is usually the silver bullet they need to sign off.\n\nAt the end of the day, VS Code with Copilot is getting shockingly close to feature parity because they both just rely on the same underlying models anyway. The difference is Microsoft and GitHub actually have the enterprise trust and regulatory due diligence to give a company real peace of mind.\n\nCursor is awesome, but Copilot gets the job done without giving your InfoSec team a heart attack. Just lean into it.",

Some companies are uncomfortable with the idea that their proprietary code could potentially be exposed through an LLM provider’s API. I think that concern is legitimate.\n\nIn many cases, companies address this by signing contracts with LLM providers and using dedicated enterprise endpoints or API keys that explicitly guarantee that their code will not be used for training.\n\nIf the restriction is based on that kind of security or legal reasoning, I think it’s justified, and as an employee, it makes sense to follow that decision.\n\nHowever, if there’s no explanation and it’s more of a “You just can’t use Cursor” type of ban, then it might be worth discussing whether the restriction can be relaxed to something like the first case.",

Ask specifically what their objections are. \"AI tool security\" is vague. Is it data residency? SOC 2? Code leaving the network? Each has a different solution.\n\n2. Cursor's Privacy Mode + their SOC 2 Type II certification addresses most enterprise concerns. Your code doesn't get stored or used for training in privacy mode. Get the actual docs from their security page and bring them to your security team with specific answers to their specific concerns.\n\n3. If they still say no, Copilot with Opus 4.6 or Codex 5.3 is honestly decent now. It's not the same workflow as Cursor's composer, but the gap is narrowing. The agent mode in Copilot has improved significantly.\n\n4. Another option your security team might accept: run models locally via Ollama + Continue.dev extension. No code leaves your machine. Quality isn't as good as cloud models, but some companies accept this as a compromise.\n\nThe reality is most companies will eventually standardize on AI coding tools, but security teams need to go through their process. Fighting them just makes you look like you're prioritizing convenience over security, which hurts your credibility internally.",

They also have SOC 2 compliance docs and enterprise deployment options. If you haven't already, pull together those specific materials and present them to your security team as a formal proposal rather than a casual ask.\n\nBut honestly, the bigger play here might be to just get really good at Copilot. With the latest models (Opus 4.6 in particular), the gap between Copilot and Cursor is much smaller than it was a year ago. The agent mode in Copilot is genuinely solid now.

So I took Cursor and ran same prompt through 7 models - Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 3 Pro, GPT 5.2, GPT 5.2 Thinking Extra High, Sonnet, Opus 4.5 and Opus 4.6.   \nI simply applied auto-accept mode and waited for the model to finish the task  \n  \n1. First prompt was to exactly replicate the website by provided link  \nGPT5.2 was the only one who matched the style, others implemented their own versions (completely different colors, fonts, style).   \nGemini did very light job and replicated only main page, others tried to replicate referenced pages.  \n  \n2. Reddit scraper to find business ideas   \nI asked to build a website which scrapes reddit API to find buisness ideas for specified subreddits. For ideas analyses I told to use OpenAI api.  \nActually every model delivered something workable, GPT and both Opus were the best imo, they produced interesting clustering graph visualisation.  \n  \n3. Desktop app for video dubbing, only local LLMs allowed  \nGemini completely failed, nothing worked. Others delivered half workable results, but for GPT and Opus at least it looked like a solid desktop app.  \n  \nFinal observations:  \nSurprisingly, I didn't notice any difference between Gemini 3Flash and 3Pro, they both delivered simple low quality results, but fast and for cheap.  \nGPT: took 30-60 min for every task to finish, always one of the highest quality, moderately expensive. Have not noticed any difference between GPT 5.2 and 5.2 Thinking Extra High  \nOpus: 4.6 tends to do less mistakes than 4.5, but overall produces very similar results.

They may be assigned against a specific LLM model (Opus for example) and end up working out that a specific design element needs greater granularity for the subordinate agents to build to as spec’d.

For greenfield single-file tasks, most models perform similarly. But once you are working in a project with 50+ files and established patterns, the gap between models that actually read context and models that just generate plausible code becomes massive.\n\nOpus 4.6 has been our go-to for anything that requires understanding existing architecture before making changes. For rapid prototyping and vibe coding from scratch, GPT 5.2 is hard to beat on speed and style matching.\n\nThe real unlock we found was using different models for different stages: a fast model for scaffolding and boilerplate, then a reasoning model for the tricky integration and debugging work. Trying to use one model for everything is like using a hammer for every job.",
