These are the ones you must have\n\n**Context 7** is like having a really smart friend who always knows the latest way to use any coding library. No more outdated examples that don't work.\n\n**Docker MCP** is genius because it keeps things clean. Instead of having hundreds of tools cluttering everything up, it only loads what you need right now.\n\n**Shadcn Registry MCP** makes building pretty websites super easy. You just ask for a component and it knows exactly how to add it without breaking stuff.\n\n**Google's new MCPs** are pretty cool if you use Google services. They just announced ones for Maps, BigQuery, and cloud stuff. There are also free ones for Firebase and other Google tools.\n\n**Notion MCP** has been a lifesaver for me. I can tell Claude to update my to-do lists, track projects, and organize ideas without ever opening Notion.\n\n**Supabase MCP** handles all the database work. No more writing confusing database commands myself - Claude just does it.\n\n  \nAnyone else using MCPs? Which ones do you like most?",

The critique step is key. It usually finds obvious fixes to lift scores from the 65-75 range.\n\nI also love to add to the first step \"do at least 10 web searches as of Dec 26, 2025 (not 2024)\" to ground it in the latest methods/versions/docs, etc.\n\nIf the task is complex or undefined, I like this:\n“Ask me 5 questions (1-5 sentences each) in a numbered list with a, b, c choices”\n\nDo another round if questions were good.\n\nThen:\n“In two paragraphs of 6-8 dense sentences each, restate my requirements in your own words”\n\nAs for what exactly I’m working on - can’t say just yet, a bit stealth but some vanilla JS websites for my business on Cloudflare Workers",

Better following of explicitly established processes in the project.\n\nI have been using Sonnet, Opus for more complex tasks and plenty of auto for simpler tasks like ticket generation / resolution. \n\n6-12 months ago I was really not enjoying Cursor, way too many bugs and tool call failure issues that made projects slow and painful. Comparatively it feels like a slick and focused tool now, really enjoying it the last few weeks on my current project.",

Why Cursor became all of a sudden this expensive? close to 2 dollars for 4 prompts? ",

      "text": "**TL;DR:** Built a tool that lets Cursor remember what it worked on across sessions. Uses lifecycle hooks to capture context and inject relevant history into new chats. Works with free AI providers.\n\n# The Problem\n\nEvery time you start a new Cursor session, your AI has amnesia. It doesn't remember:\n\n* The architecture decisions you made yesterday\n* That weird edge case you spent 2 hours debugging\n* Your project's conventions and patterns\n* Why you structured things a certain way\n\nYou end up re-explaining context constantly, or your AI makes suggestions that conflict with decisions you already made.\n\n# What I Built\n\n**Claude-mem** is a persistent memory layer for Cursor. It:\n\n1. **Captures** tool usage, file edits, and shell commands via Cursor's native hook system\n2. **Extracts** semantic observations using AI (what happened, why it matters)\n3. **Injects** relevant context into new sessions automatically\n4. **Scopes** memory per-project so different codebases stay separate\n\nThere's a local web viewer at `localhost:37777` where you can browse your knowledge base.\n\n# The Big Thing: No Paid Subscription Required\n\nThis was important to me. You can use claude-mem with:\n\n* **Gemini** (recommended) - 1,500 free requests/day, no credit card\n* **OpenRouter** \\- 100+ models including free options\n* **Claude SDK** \\- If you already have Claude Code\n\nMost individual developers won't hit Gemini's free tier limits with normal usage.\n\n# How It Works\n\nCursor has a native hook system. Claude-mem installs hooks that fire on:\n\n* Session start → inject relevant past context\n* User messages → capture what you're asking\n* Tool usage → log MCP tool calls\n* File edits → track what changed\n* Session end → generate summary\n\nContext gets injected via `.cursor/rules/claude-mem-context.mdc` so your AI sees relevant history immediately.\n\n# Installation\n\nThere's an interactive setup wizard that handles everything:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem.git\n    cd claude-mem && bun install && bun run build\n    bun run cursor:setup\n\nThe wizard detects your environment, helps you pick a provider, installs hooks, and starts the worker service.\n\n**If you have Claude Code:**\n\n    /plugin marketplace add thedotmack/claude-mem\n    /plugin install claude-mem\n    claude-mem cursor install\n\n# Platform Support\n\n* **macOS** ✓\n* **Linux** ✓\n* **Windows** ✓ (native PowerShell, no WSL needed)\n\n# What's Captured\n\nThe hook system tracks:\n\n* Tool calls and their results\n* File edits with before/after context\n* Shell commands and output\n* Your prompts and the AI's responses\n* Session summaries\n\nEverything stays local on your machine.\n\n# MCP Integration\n\nFull MCP server with search tools:\n\n* `search` \\- Find observations by query, date, type\n* `timeline` \\- Get context around specific observations\n* `get_observations` \\- Fetch full details\n\n# Links\n\n* **GitHub:** [https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem)\n* **Docs:** [https://docs.claude-mem.ai/cursor](https://docs.claude-mem.ai/cursor)\n* **Changelog:** [https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v8.2.10...v8.5.0](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem/compare/v8.2.10...v8.5.0)\n\nHappy to answer questions. This started as a tool I built for myself for Claude Code because the session amnesia was driving me crazy—turned out other people had the same problem.",

              "text": "The battle has been won, it is working now. Here is what I had to change to fix everything:\n\n# Claude-Mem Windows/Cursor Fixes\n\n**Date:** 2025-12-30  \n**Version:** claude-mem 8.5.1  \n**Environment:** Windows 10/11, Cursor 2.3.15, PowerShell 5.1+\n\n## Overview\n\nAfter installing claude-mem for Cursor on Windows using `bun run cursor:setup`, the hooks were not capturing sessions. After extensive debugging, we found **5 bugs** in the Windows/Cursor integration that required manual fixes.\n\n---\n\n## Bug 1: Missing Claude Code Directory\n\n**Symptom:** Worker fails to start with error:\n```\nENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\\Users\\Matt\\.claude\\plugins\\marketplaces\\thedotmack\\package.json'\n```\n\n**Cause:** The worker tries to scan for Claude Code plugins even when only using Cursor.\n\n**Fix:** Create the expected directory and a placeholder package.json:\n\n\n    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path \"$env:USERPROFILE\\.claude\\plugins\\marketplaces\\thedotmack\" -Force\n    \n    @\"\n    {\n      \"name\": \"thedotmack-placeholder\",\n      \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n    }\n    \"@ | Out-File \"$env:USERPROFILE\\.claude\\plugins\\marketplaces\\thedotmack\\package.json\" -Encoding UTF8\n    \n---\n\n## Bug 2: Installer Creates Wrong hooks.json for Windows\n\n**Symptom:** After running `bun run cursor:setup`, the `~/.cursor/hooks.json` file points to a `.sh` script instead of PowerShell scripts.\n\n**Bad (what installer creates):**\n    \n    {\n      \"version\": 1,\n      \"hooks\": {\n        \"beforeSubmitPrompt\": [\n          { \"command\": \"./hooks/beforePromptSubmit.sh\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n    \n\n**Fix:** Replace with proper Windows PowerShell configuration:\n\n    {\n      \"version\": 1,\n      \"hooks\": {\n        \"beforeSubmitPrompt\": [\n          { \"command\": \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\.cursor\\\\hooks\\\\session-init.ps1\\\"\" },\n          { \"command\": \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\.cursor\\\\hooks\\\\context-inject.ps1\\\"\" }\n        ],\n        \"afterMCPExecution\": [\n          { \"command\": \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\.cursor\\\\hooks\\\\save-observation.ps1\\\"\" }\n        ],\n        \"afterShellExecution\": [\n          { \"command\": \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\.cursor\\\\hooks\\\\save-observation.ps1\\\"\" }\n        ],\n        \"afterFileEdit\": [\n          { \"command\": \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\.cursor\\\\hooks\\\\save-file-edit.ps1\\\"\" }\n        ],\n        \"stop\": [\n          { \"command\": \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \\\"C:\\\\Users\\\\YOUR_USERNAME\\\\.cursor\\\\hooks\\\\session-summary.ps1\\\"\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n\n\n---\n\n## Bug 3: `Start-Job` Doesn't Work in Hook Scripts\n\n**Location:** `~/.cursor/hooks/common.ps1` - `Send-HttpPostAsync` function\n\n**Symptom:** HTTP POST requests never reach the worker. Scripts complete but no sessions are created.\n\n**Cause:** `Start-Job` spawns a separate PowerShell process that doesn't complete before the parent hook script exits.\n\n**Bad (original):**\n    \n    function Send-HttpPostAsync {\n        param([string]$Uri, [object]$Body)\n        try {\n            $bodyJson = ConvertTo-JsonCompact $Body\n            Start-Job -ScriptBlock {\n                param($u, $b)\n                Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $u -Method Post -Body $b -ContentType \"application/json\" -TimeoutSec 5\n            } -ArgumentList $Uri, $bodyJson | Out-Null\n        } catch {}\n    }\n    \n\n**Fix (use synchronous request):**\n\n    powershell\n    function Send-HttpPostAsync {\n        param([string]$Uri, [object]$Body)\n        try {\n            $bodyJson = ConvertTo-JsonCompact $Body\n            Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $Uri -Method Post -Body $bodyJson -ContentType \"application/json\" -TimeoutSec 2 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Out-Null\n        } catch {}\n    }\n    \n\n---\n\n## Bug 4: `$input` is a Reserved PowerShell Variable\n\n**Location:** `~/.cursor/hooks/common.ps1` - `Read-JsonInput` function, and all hook scripts that use `$input = Read-JsonInput`\n\n**Symptom:** JSON parsing silently fails, returns empty object.\n\n**Cause:** `$input` is an automatic variable in PowerShell that contains pipeline input. Using it as a regular variable causes conflicts.\n\n**Fix in `common.ps1`:**\n    \n    # Change from:\n    $input = [Console]::In.ReadToEnd()\n    \n    # To:\n    $jsonText = [Console]::In.ReadToEnd()\n    \n\n**Fix in hook scripts (e.g., `session-init.ps1`):**\n    \n    # Change from:\n    $input = Read-JsonInput\n    $conversationId = Get-JsonField $input \"conversation_id\" \"\"\n    \n    # To:\n    $jsonData = Read-JsonInput\n    $conversationId = Get-JsonField $jsonData \"conversation_id\" \"\"\n    \n\n---\n\n## Bug 5: `[Console]::In.ReadToEnd()` Doesn't Work\n\n**Location:** `~/.cursor/hooks/common.ps1` - `Read-JsonInput` function\n\n**Symptom:** `Read-JsonInput` returns empty object even when Cursor passes valid JSON via stdin.\n\n**Cause:** When PowerShell is invoked with `-File`, `[Console]::In.ReadToEnd()` doesn't properly read piped stdin.\n\n**Bad (original):**\n    \n    function Read-JsonInput {\n        try {\n            $jsonText = [Console]::In.ReadToEnd()\n            if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($jsonText)) { return @{} }\n            return $jsonText | ConvertFrom-Json\n        } catch { return @{} }\n    }\n    \n\n**Fix (use ReadLine loop):**\n\n    \n    function Read-JsonInput {\n        try {\n            $lines = @()\n            while ($line = [Console]::ReadLine()) {\n                $lines += $line\n            }\n            $jsonText = $lines -join \"`n\"\n            if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($jsonText)) { return @{} }\n            return $jsonText | ConvertFrom-Json\n        } catch { return @{} }\n    }\n    \n\n---\n\n## Complete Fixed `common.ps1`\n\nHere's the corrected `Read-JsonInput` and `Send-HttpPostAsync` functions:\n\n    \n    # Safely read JSON from stdin with error handling\n    function Read-JsonInput {\n        try {\n            $lines = @()\n            while ($line = [Console]::ReadLine()) {\n                $lines += $line\n            }\n            $jsonText = $lines -join \"`n\"\n            \n            if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($jsonText)) {\n                return @{}\n            }\n            return $jsonText | ConvertFrom-Json -ErrorAction Stop\n        } catch {\n            return @{}\n        }\n    }\n    \n    # Send HTTP POST request (synchronous - Start-Job doesn't work on Windows)\n    function Send-HttpPostAsync {\n        param(\n            [string]$Uri,\n            [object]$Body\n        )\n        try {\n            $bodyJson = ConvertTo-JsonCompact $Body\n            Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $Uri -Method Post -Body $bodyJson -ContentType \"application/json\" -TimeoutSec 2 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Out-Null\n        } catch {\n            # Ignore errors - fire and forget\n        }\n    }\n    \n\n---\n\n## Verification\n\nAfter applying all fixes:\n\n1. Restart the worker: `bun run worker:restart`\n2. Restart Cursor\n3. Check Hooks output channel (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → \"Output: Show Output Channels\" → \"Hooks\")\n4. Send a message in chat\n5. Check http://localhost:37777 — sessions should appear\n\n---\n\n## Files Modified\n\n| File | Changes |\n|------|---------|\n| `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/thedotmack/package.json` | Created (placeholder) |\n| `~/.cursor/hooks.json` | Replaced with PowerShell commands |\n| `~/.cursor/hooks/common.ps1` | Fixed `Read-JsonInput`, `Send-HttpPostAsync`, `Send-HttpPost` |\n| `~/.cursor/hooks/session-init.ps1` | Changed `$input` to `$jsonData` |\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThese bugs should be reported to the claude-mem maintainers. The Windows/Cursor integration needs:\n\n1. Proper Windows detection in the installer\n2. PowerShell-specific stdin handling\n3. Synchronous HTTP requests (or proper async that waits)\n4. Avoid reserved variable names like `$input`",

It's very fast, easy, and lazy to make bold assertions backed by nothing, while actual explanations take a long time and a lot of words. \n\nDid you read my findings or are you just responding to the summary? \n\nIf you give a model a clear set of instructions and strict code standards that explain the exact requirements for the work, and it doesn't follow them, that's not a problem prompting the model, that's a problem with the model not implementing all the constraints provided. \n\nFor example, in the last hour, I've had Claude read my instructions that explain exactly how to order a workflow - strict TDD, lowest deps to highest, types first, then type guards, then source - and build a work plan. These instructions are extremely clear. And it not only ignores them, it does the opposite. It describes doing the highest level work before the lowest level, lumping types into a monolithic file instead of putting them where they go, putting type guards directly in the interface, changing the names of everything, type casting, type aliasing. \n\nThe models just don't follow instructions well. This results in the vast majority of work being wasted while the user has to review the work, explain what instructions were violated, demand correction, over and over and over until the agent finally, incrementally, bit by bit, step by step, turn by turn, implements constraint 1, then constraint 2, then constraint 3, and so on, until you reach constraint n. \n\nThose constraints were all provided in the very first turn, and are easy to follow. The agents just do not do what they're told.\n\nThis is not user error. This is a shortcoming of the models. \n\nNow, to your point, no, I do not believe they are built for software engineers. A software engineer wouldn't type cast at every opportunity. They wouldn't alias imports for no apparent reason, or import entire modules to get a single function. Import a type just to export it again so they can import it from another file instead of importing it from the canonical source. Produce inline types in tests, that only exist in tests, instead of building an actual correct type and using it.\n\nIf they were built for software engineers, they wouldn't default to lazy hacky slop that no self-respecting software engineer will accept. An agent built for software engineers would be designed to follow provided code standards and do exactly what they're told - the same standard any developer on a professional team would be held to.\n\nI think they're built to impress investors with gee whiz, wow-factor big-bang \"one shot\" prompt techniques so that the investor, who has no idea what clean code and clean architecture looks like, will say \"oh man, wow, that's amazing!\" and write a big check, not realizing that the actual work product that \"amazes\" them is unmaintainable non-standards-compliant garbage.",

Also added internal GPT chat that help users talk to their data.

I run Opus 4.5 on Cursor Ultra and hit usage-based pricing often.\n\nThinking about Claude Code Max but unclear on Opus token limits.\n\nWhich one yields more Opus tokens in practice?\n\n\\*\\* Not asking about model quality, purely token efficiency / cost per Opus token.\n\nEdit: To clarify, I’m specifically asking how much longer Claude Code lasts compared to Cursor Ultra when using Opus (token burn / quota efficiency).\n\nEdit 2: Quick update after more testing today. I spent time using Antigravity and Claude Code, and while I fully understand that almost anything outside of Cursor can be cheaper, I found myself constantly fighting the tools and never feeling fully confident about what was actually happening.\n\nWith Cursor, everything just clicks. I can’t fully explain what it is. The UX, the flow, the editor integration. It’s spectacular. I genuinely wish there were a cheaper alternative at the same level of quality, but right now there simply isn’t. Cursor is worth every cent, and after trying alternatives, I appreciate it more than ever. For me, it’s clearly the best code editor available today.",

Things like \"always use TypeScript strict mode\" and \"prefer functional components\" - pretty standard stuff.\n\nBut Cursor straight up ignores them. Like they don't exist.\n\nHere's where it gets frustrating:\n\n* If I put the same rules in `.cursorrules` at my project root → **works perfectly**\n* If I put them in User Rules (Settings) → **nothing happens**\n\n**The Corporate Catch-22:**\n\nMy company has a policy: no `.cursorrules` file in repos (CTO maintains that), and we can't gitignore it either. So I'm stuck needing *global* rules that apply to everything I code, but the feature that's supposed to do exactly that... doesn't.\n\n**What I've Tried:**\n\n* Restarting Cursor (multiple times)\n* Different models (Claude 3.5, GPT-4)\n* Clearing settings and re-adding rules\n* Checked the official docs (they're... sparse on this)\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n1. Does anyone else's User Rules actually work? What am I missing?\n2. Is there a workaround for getting global rules without `.cursorrules`?\n3. Has anyone found success with the new `.cursor/rules/` folder approach for personal rules?\n\n  \nI've seen some people use tools like [cursor.directory](https://cursor.directory) or [promptdir.info](https://promptdir.info) to manage and organize their rules - curious if anyone's had better luck with external rule management that can be applied globally.\n\nAny help would be huge.

Prefer small, surgical edits; avoid large rewrites of `app.py` unless explicitly requested.\n\n## Project reality (keep changes aligned)\n\n- **Production context**\n  - High-traffic deployment behind Cloudflare + Traefik (`your-site.example.com`).\n  - Real client IP comes from Cloudflare (`CF-Connecting-IP`) and must not be spoofable.\n- **Entry points**\n  - `app.py` defines the global Flask application (`app = Flask(__name__)`).\n  - `startup.py` exists to enforce gevent monkey‑patching order for production.\n- **Deployment**\n  - Docker Compose service: `your-service` (with `your-service_postgres`, `your-service_redis`) in `docker-compose.yml`.\n  - Gunicorn gevent workers (default `GUNICORN_WORKERS=6`); DB pool sizing depends on worker count.\n- **Auth**\n  - Session-based authentication (not JWT). Check `session.get('user_id')` / `session.get('is_admin')`.\n- **Configuration**\n  - Centralized config lives in `config_manager.py` (`config_manager` singleton). Prefer reading config from there (or passing config into helpers) instead of sprinkling new `os.getenv(...)` calls.\n- **Data storage**\n  - JSON files under `DATA_DIR` (Docker mounts `./data` → `/data`); use `routes/data_paths.py`.\n  - PostgreSQL integration is enabled when `USE_DATABASE=true` via `database_integration.py` (psycopg2 pool + tenacity).\n- **Redis**\n  - Redis is used for caching/sessions/rate limiting; always use `redis_manager.py` APIs (built-in fallback exists).\n\n## Coding style\n\n- Prefer functions + small modules; add type hints for touched function signatures where reasonable (use `python3`, not `python`).\n- Use guard clauses (early returns) for invalid states; keep the happy path last; avoid deep nesting.\n- Avoid circular imports: do not import from `app.py` inside blueprints/utilities unless unavoidable—extract shared helpers instead.\n- Prefer a simple RORO shape for helpers: accept a single dict-like \"params/context\" object, return a dict result.\n\n## Routes and request lifecycle\n\n- Prefer placing new routes in `routes/` as Blueprints and registering them in `app.py` near the existing blueprint section.\n- Use existing decorators/hooks consistently:\n  - Security: `security_middleware.security_check` (and app-level `before_request` protections)\n  - Rate limiting: `rate_limiting.rate_limit` / other limiter helpers\n  - CSRF: `csrf_protection.csrf_required` for all state-changing endpoints\n- Return shapes:\n  - HTML routes: redirect with user-friendly messages.\n  - API routes: JSON errors with appropriate status codes.\n\n## Security standards (production)\n\n- State-changing routes (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE): require `@csrf_required` and an appropriate rate-limit decorator.\n- Apply request validation consistently: prefer `security_middleware.security_check` on blueprint routes and keep app-level `before_request` protections intact.\n- Treat all headers/paths as untrusted:\n  - Keep Cloudflare-aware IP detection order; do not trust `X-Forwarded-For` without proxy validation.\n  - Validate all filesystem paths and user-provided filenames.\n- Validate/sanitize user input with existing validators (`input_validation.py`) and log security-relevant failures with request context.\n- For subprocess/system calls, prefer `secure_subprocess.py`; avoid ad-hoc `subprocess.*` with untrusted input.\n- Do not weaken CSP/HSTS/security headers (Traefik labels + Flask `after_request`) without an explicit, documented reason and verification plan.\n\n## Performance standards (high-traffic)\n\n- Avoid per-request disk work: use `data_cache.load_json_cached(...)` for reads and `atomic_update_json(...)` for writes.\n- Keep lock windows small: do expensive validation/processing before entering `atomic_update_json` update functions.\n- Prefer caching over recomputation: use Redis-backed caches where available; code must still work when Redis is down (fallback mode).\n- Don't block request workers with long I/O (file/network): use `async_operations.py` patterns for background/async work.\n- Keep DB usage pool-friendly: short transactions, fetch only needed fields, return connections promptly, and avoid N+1 patterns.\n\n## JSON config/data edits (important)\n\n- Treat JSON files as shared concurrent state (multiple workers/requests).\n- For reads: prefer `data_cache.load_json_cached(...)`.\n- For writes: prefer `data_cache.atomic_update_json(path, update_fn)`; do not hand-roll read/modify/write.\n- When adding new JSON files, put them under `data/` (or `DATA_DIR`) and keep schemas backward-compatible.\n\n## File uploads and filesystem\n\n- For uploads and file writes, prefer hardened helpers:\n  - Path/file validation: `secure_file_ops.SecureFileOperations`\n  - Atomic JSON: `atomic_json.AtomicJSONManager`\n  - File locking: `file_locking.FileLockManager`\n- Always use `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename` for user-provided filenames and validate content (extension + magic) before processing.\n\n## Database integration (PostgreSQL)\n\n- Use `database_integration.py` as the primary API surface when `USE_DATABASE=true`.\n- Always acquire connections via context management:\n  - `DatabaseConnectionContext` or decorators in `database_decorator.py` (e.g., `@with_database_context`).\n- Never hold a DB connection across requests; always return to the pool.\n- Use `RealDictCursor` when you need dict-like row access.\n\n## Redis\n\n- Use `redis_manager.redis_manager` (singleton) or `app.redis_manager` when available.\n- Prefer `redis_manager.get(...)` / `redis_manager.set(...)` and `@redis_operation` to get automatic fallback behavior.\n- Don't assume Redis is up: code must behave correctly when `redis_manager.is_connected` is `False`.\n\n## Logging, monitoring, and errors\n\n- Prefer production/structured logging helpers (`production_logging.py`, `structured_logging.py`).\n- Avoid logging secrets (session cookies, passwords, tokens, raw auth headers).\n- Use existing error patterns (`error_handling.py`, `error_handler.py`, `specific_error_handlers.py`) for consistency.\n\n## Running / maintenance\n\n- Deploy/rebuild service: `make build` (runs Docker Compose for `your-service` as configured).\n- Quick syntax check: `python3 -m compileall .`\n\n## Change documentation (required)\n\nAll modifications must be documented in `changes.md` immediately after implementation. Each entry must include:\n\n- Timestamp\n- Files touched\n- Exact code added/removed/changed (include file paths and line numbers where applicable)\n- What the change does + why it was made",

You easily see just how often your rules are ignored.\n\n\nTo make matters worse, I also use Claude Code in Cursor, which has its own method of adding rules. The setup I found to be the best is to add a cursor rule in your user settings saying ALWAYS read and follow all instructions in my AGENTS.md and global CLAUDE.md files. Then at the top of AGENTS.md reference your CLAUDE.md with a similar rule. Do the same in your CLAUDE.md.\n\n\nAlso make sure you update your cursor settings to \"always\" (aka, sometimes, when it feels like it) use your CLAUDE.md.\n\n\nThis way Cursor and Claude Code will, in my experience, always find and use your rules. I keep project specific rules and general information in AGENTS.md and my global rules in CLAUDE.md.\n\n\nI have also heard, and I forget the source, that AGENTS.md is loaded in context at a more.... privileged? Level. Somewhere between user query and system prompt. I think this matters because the models will interpret it with a more direct interpretation. Instead of like \"well the user said X, but they probably really mean Y.\"",

But nowadays most people , and I'm just assuming, most people generate with agent and review the code manually. When reviewing the code they might fix manually (that's when the autocomplete kicks in) or ask the agent to fix a specific part and then re-verify manually. Human code review is very important but to be able to do an effective review the dev must be an experienced engineer. You can also combine human code review + ai code review.\n\nIn general to answer your question (since im deviating), there is not much to optimize for auto complete, cursor already does that for you based on the files you are opening and recent edits.",

It creates a lot of syntax errors for me, not properly closing a curly or parens, or deleting too many lines. It all gets in the way when I'm just arrowing through my lines. It works so fast that I'll be reading through a line, arrow down but at the same time it will suggest a new completion and before I know it, I've accepted the completion and it removed a bunch of code I needed. Overall, I think it's really powerful but needs a better UX",

I really value knowing for sure when the system is allowed to edit my code versus when it’s just answering questions.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations?\nThank you\n\n",

I’m sticking with WindSurf for sure as it’s mostly a very similar experience and I’ve not had any issues in the past 6 months or so.\n\n\nIt’s also worth looking into a Claude Pro sub.\n20 a month and the limit is according to them about 45 messages during a 5 hour window. So unless you do a lot of work during a 5 hour window. It’s basically the best deal you could get for regular use throughout an entire month.\n\nI’m going to give it a try myself and see if it’s a good experience as I would still prefer to work in an IDE.\n\nI also have google Antigravity. However!! The use is very limited unfortunately and the pricing and usage breakdown is even more vague than Cursor.\n\nI used it for a couple of days (a couple of prompts a day) and it said I needed to wait for a whole week to continue using it while on the AI pro plan (on discount for the first 3 months) \nThat was absolutely worthless. So I’ve not used it since to be honest. And while the app is OK. I found it the most buggy by far. It would regularly stop for no reason. It completely stopped working a couple of times and the browser opening and manipulation functionality is very neat but does not work around 40% of the time. All in all I think it still has a lot of work needed to be considered a good and solid experience. In my humble opinion.",

Then it started changing the encoding format on the txt files it was creating. At the end I had maybe 8 different files. \n\nUltimately it was able to read them thankfully. It made it halfway through fixing lint errors until giving up and saying \" okay I fixed half. I'm stopping now\". Then I had to ask it to continue....only to repeat the entire process of file read issues all over again!

      "text": "Recently I've made the swtich from Cursor to Zed because cursor performance has been terrible since 2.0, and I'm loving Zed but couldn't completely switch yet cause I'm feeling Claude on Zed is not as good as it is on Cursor, yeah I know that sounds unlikely right?\n\nI'm using the same model (sonnet most of the time) same rules (cursor settings and .claude/rules), Pro+ plan on Cursor and Pro on Claude (I highly doubt this make any difference anyways) and using it for web development (React + RoR) always planning first and guiding the agent step by step if necessary. And still there's times I feel that Claude on Zed is so much \"dumb\" than when used on Cursor, while on my Claude average use on Cursor I need 2 to 3 prompts to complete a task/step then on Zed I need a lot more cause most of the time the agent is not following all my rules or ignoring project patterns, typescript types and leaving the same lint errors that I asked it to fix few prompts ago.\n\nSo I've made some tests to confirm that, I was starting a new project on Elysia (first time using it) so I created a new project using Elysia cli, made a clone of it and asked the same prompts on both editors using Claude sonnet 4.5:\n\n\\- First I started asking for both agents what are the rules they are receiving in my prompts, there wasn't any project/workspace rule, just the user rules on Cursor and claude global rules on ./claude/rules, [this are the rules I use globally for all AI agents btw](https://gist.github.com/guustavocl/9776865c5964933600701149512b7cbb). So the results were the following:\n\nClaude on Cursor answered with those exactly same rules that I defined on its settings, while Claude on Zed also returned the global rules I defined but not before a huge set of additional rules/explanations/conduct, tbh a load of garbage stuff that's just stalling instead of helping, so maybe that's the cause of the inconsistency between them. (also just remembered that you can also place the rules inside Zed editor, but that doesn't seems to work, if you place it there and ask the agent to list the rules he will never list the ones you placed there)\n\n\\- Next I started asking both agents to setup Eslint and Prettier in the project, neither opted to run the init cli command instead they created the config files manually, they didn't used the .cjs extension for eslint but .json, that's fine it worked as intended at the end.\n\n\\- Next I explained our goals: \"This is a new Elysia API project, we gonna use MongoDB and Mongoose with BetterAuth for authentication, also we gonna need to add openapi and validate our routes using TypeBox, we also need to protect our posts POST/UPDATE/DELETE routes with normal user authorization, and our users GET/UPDATE/DELETE with admin authorization, users don't need a POST route cause we're using sign\\_up from betterauth for that.\".\n\nthen both agents proceeded with planning/explaining to me what they're gonna do first and waiting for approval to start coding, as stated on my rules, both plans were pretty similar so I give them the approval...\n\nNeither nailed it on the first or second try ofc, I've choose MongoDB on purpose cause there's plenty of examples out there using PG/Drizzle with better auth while MongoDB it's listed as experimental, so that's okay and manageable, they've missed some adapters configs and weird stuffs as using id: string instead of mongo \\_id: objectId (default and implicit), but manageable and fixed in a few prompts, similar problems on both agents but some distinct ways of solving it.\n\n\\- After that the API was running, openapi was listing our routes but betterauth routes aren't there, so I instruct them about that and then the nightmare started, while Claude on Cursor manage to fix this in two prompts, Claude on Zed never did, I also give it hints and list the Elysia betterauth docs where there's exactly listed the two piece of codes you need to make it work, but Claude on Zed always wanted to tweak them and either add more code or remove parts of it, in the end I practically told it: \"this piece of code goes here, and this other one goes here, just that.\" to make it works and move on to the next step.\n\n\\- Now both projects were working and showing the betterauth routes on openapi page, but still not capable of sign\\_up and sing\\_in because the mongoose.client that goes into the mongodbAdapter inside betterauth was being instantiated before the mongoose successfully connect to the db, so we needed some kind of singleton around our betterauth instance to handle that, BUT I never explained that to them, it was gonna be too easy right? So I just sent them the console errors about moongose not able to listen the db... Claude on Cursor checked the files and solve it in one prompt, two cause it forget to use the singleton in the authorization middleware. BUT Claude on Zed again never manage to solve that, after dozens of prompts I explained exactly what it needed to do and even after that it poorly implemented something that Claude on Cursor did in the first try, so at this moment I gave up.\n\nTL/DR: I've Tested both agents Claude Sonnet 4.5 on both editors Zed and Cursor with the same tasks, and the inconsistency between them was tremendous, Claude on Cursor nailed it almost every prompt, while Claude on Zed failed to perform the same \"difficult\" tasks.\n\nPS.: Also I was always checking the Zed Claude usage limits on Claude settings page, it has never reached 100% nor dropped to cheap models.\n\nHas anyone gone through something similar and notice these differences? Or am I missing something?\n\nI really want to stuck only with Zed but after all that I'm afraid that I'll spent more time/tokens babysitting Claude than using it on Cursor.\n\nThank you if your read till here, I really appreciate it.",

This month on the $60 tier, I'm up to $102 in usage so far according to the billing and invoices tab.\n\nI don't know if this affects it but I have on demand billing turned off. If I end up getting cut off at some point, I'm going to switch to claude code's $100 max plan and try to use it in cursor, downgrading to cursors $20 plan. Not ready to jump to cursors $200 plan and I mostly just use claude opus, so I think I'd get more bang per buck via claude code max agent instead of cursors at that point.\n\nEdit: Just got cut off at $110.86 this month.

Opus tends to “get it” with much lighter guidance, whereas Sonnet feels more sensitive to both the wording and the structure of rules, especially once project-specific context is involved.\n\nThe point about selectively applying different rule sets per model is interesting , I’ve noticed that trying to reuse a single detailed rules file across models often backfires. Shorter, more explicit constraints seem to work better for Sonnet, even if they’re a bit redundant.\n\nAlso +1 on **Always Apply** for anything critical. I’ve had “Apply intelligently” skip things that were very obviously important, which can be frustrating when debugging why behavior suddenly changed.\n\nOut of curiosity, do you keep those per-model rules completely separate, or do you generate the lighter versions from a shared base and trim them down?",

      "text": "I'll keep this as short as I can. But the context is important.\n\nI'm embarrassed to tell people I use Cursor to code.\n\nTHEN:  \n  \nI was always interested in coding and even regret not studying computer science when in college. Once I finished my finance degree, I had more freedom to learn - so I picked up coding/programming start of 2024. \n\nGiven my short experience and interest in finance and a natural liking to computer science, of course I dove straight into crypto, Solana, Ethereum, Binance Chain programming -- I wanted to learn it all. I then learned how to code in Python, then JS, TS, however -- this was in the height of the \"AI boom\" as I like to call it. \n\nI started using ChatGPT to code/debug stuff I did, I wasnt an expert and wasnt the most proficient at coding yet, but I started to notice that I really liked the ease of using ChatGPT to code! I thought of it as a \"word-calculator\", it felt like cheating -- like that time when you are in math class and they dont let you use the calculator on a test. Then I found Cursor.\n\nNOW: \n\nIn 2 years, I went from not knowing how to code at all, to building full on web3 applications. I have optimized my workflow so well: custom MCPs, rules, read/write optimizations, etc. I can now confidently say that I feel like I can \"code\" anything. \n\nFor a while I thought \"is this what vibecoding is?\" because I would see peoples \"vibe-coded\" projects, and they look so bad! I wondered \"why does their vibecoded website look so bad compared to mine? Aren't I doing the same thing?\" Granted - I reviewed/edited every line of code Cursor had printed out and had an understanding of how my applications should work.   \n  \nUltimately, I have severe imposter syndrome. \n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nI run a projects now, that do/can make me money, but I feel like a fraud telling people that \"I can code them a website/application\" because in all reality, I am not that smart. So, I am embarrassed to tell people that I use Cursor, AI as a whole, to build/program/code production-ready applications.   \n  \nDoes anyone feel the same way? Can I even call myself a \"developer\" or \"programmer\"?  How do I compare to seasoned junior/senior developers in the CompSci space? Is it worth mentioning to people that I use AI to code?   ",

I use them for all sorts of things, and I don't hide it from my employer.\n\nWhat I think you are recognizing and internally cringing at is that you are *dependent* upon LLMs. You could not complete the projects that you did without an LLM. Not just that it speeds you up, but that it is actually making decisions that you don't really understand.\n\nLet me be clear what I mean when I say you don't understand. I realize you read the code after the fact and figure out how it works. That is good. But I mean that you don't understand in the deeper sense. You don't understand what the alternative options were. You don't understand what the decisions made today commit you to doing tomorrow. You don't truly own what was produced in that way. You are in that sense dependent upon the LLM.\n\nFurthermore, you probably aren't doing the sorts of things that go into real software engineering, like benchmarking, testing, documenting, etc. That probably also contributes to your internal sense of shame. You don't have the sort of confidence about what you did that comes from having done it with engineering excellence.\n\nI also see a lot of people espousing a sort of anti-professionalism in this thread, saying things like, \"what matters is the value delivered.\" I see that sort of rhetoric a lot in real life, and it is typically said by someone who is producing trivial scripts that do nothing of real value other than to pad their list of projects for the year-end bonus.\n\nThe sort of projects I work on would cost the business hundreds of thousands of dollars if they failed. Engineering matters. Whether you use an LLM or not to create the code does not matter, but what does matter is precisely the professionalism.\n\nThe sort of \"get it done\" attitude does not fly when we are talking about complex software systems where tiny edge cases can cause massive financial or reputational damage to a customer.\n\nI would encourage you to continue studying software development through more traditional means, along with using LLMs. That means reading books, doing coding challenges, working through coding projects without significant LLM assistance. Over time, if your career takes you that way, you'll become more of a professional and less of an imposter.",

I don’t want to risk accidentally using work credits elsewhere, so I’ve been mainly using Kiro and antigravity, but frankly, they’re just not as good as Cursor in my opinion. Is there an easy “switch” for accounts I could setup, rather than the basic sign out, sign in, repeat process?",
