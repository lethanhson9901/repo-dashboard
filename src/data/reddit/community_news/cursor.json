Right now, whatever task I could throw out there, 5.2 will get done appropriately no matter what, with great reasoning and forethought. Auto feels remarkably dumb most of the time in comparison, while being better than some cheaper model options.\n\nI can't imagine needing more than 5.2 , I just currently can't use it all the time due to its high cost. So I agree with other people's thoughts that they really need to be focusing on developing a 'good enough' model that's dirt cheap... I think anything more expensive than what's out there already is kind of pointless. I don't know anyone who's clamoring for AI to 'do more', rather than 'cost less'.",

The model-switching workflow is slightly annoying but the results are significantly better than using one model for everything. Composer 1 filled the \"quick edit, fast iteration\" slot perfectly at its price point.\n\nThe real question is whether 1.5 is good enough to replace the premium models for complex tasks, or just too expensive for the simple ones.

In this case with composer 1.5 I don't know if the model size changed but they may have to adjust pricing so its actually profitable for them.   \n  \nI understand this change and if Composer 1.5 is still as fast as 1 then it will be worth it. For straight forward changes composer 1 often worked better than even opus 4.5 so as long as composer 1.5 complies it may still have use even with this increased price although this pricing pushes them into the territory of all the other model providers so it REALLY has to be good now.",

Cursor will likely lose a lot of users in the future because there will be little value in coding with cheaper models.  You already see this happening, Opus 4.5 isn't cheap and yet who would build anything significant on anything else?\n\nPeople aren't going to be able to afford to learn the high end models that companies want to hire for without a significant investment.  \n\nThere is no future where the cutting edge model is also the most affordable.  This means a lot less users for products like Cursor, at some point - probably this year.  This is why I believe they don't really care about their current customers.",

      "text": "I keep seeing YouTube videos and news reports claiming that AI hasn’t really improved programmer productivity, and I honestly find that hard to believe. A common claim is that AI boosts productivity for junior developers but actually *reduces* productivity for senior devs.\n\nThat makes me wonder: am I secretly a junior in disguise, or are people just dumb and not using AI very effectively?\n\nPersonally, I’ve found AI to be a huge productivity boost. As I’ve gained more experience using it—and as the models themselves have improved—I’ve noticed I’m making fewer mistakes, not more. While people often say “AI writes bad code,” even setting code generation aside, the gains from faster debugging, troubleshooting, research, and environment setup feel very real.\n\nFor example, I recently ran into MySQL Workbench issues after an upgrade. ChatGPT helped me diagnose and fix it in about 15 minutes. Years ago, that would’ve meant trawling through docs and Stack Overflow threads for hours.\n\nCurious what others think, especially senior devs. Has AI actually hurt your productivity, or does it depend on how you use it? Why is there this narrative that it's not helping with productivity??",

The productivity boost is real, tangible, and exponential. 10x is not an exaggeration here.\n2. **Corp Mode:** I see my devs using Cursor/Copilot and loving it. They are definitely coding faster and building cool internal tools. **However**, our official project timelines? **Zero change.**\n\n**Why?** Because in a corporate environment, 'writing code' was never the bottleneck. The bottleneck is alignment, meetings, PR reviews, CI/CD pipelines, legacy integration, and compliance.\n\nAI made the 'typing' part instant, but it didn't solve the organizational friction.

For example, there may be some code refactoring or cleanup that we can whip through quickly and just get done. There's not necessarily any immediate impact for end users or for bottom line revenues - the benefit comes 8 years later when a junior developer has to write a new method and it's easier for her because someone else cleaned up the code 8 years prior.

Its in classic ai stack of node (not next), react, typescript, tailwind. I have been using AI tools since early 2023 so I have a pretty rock solid environment setup for it. I built all of our existing functionality in about 3 weeks and am now enhancing and expanding things building in features our customers have wanted for years, but we're difficult or impossible to build in our legacy app. Frontend is super quick, like multiple releases a week, and backend stuff is still pretty fast when I need to make changes. Main bottleneck there is testing and review for anything that might touch DB or handle sensitive pii/phi, and managing AWS environment for a few things that deal with those services. \n\nIt's crazy because I am not a dev and only have about 2.5yrs of comp sci under my belt (2005-2007, so we were just getting deep into JavaScript when I switched majors). I am very technical, building PCs and doing script kiddie shit from childhood, and was a senior server and network admin for many years, so I understand things at a high level and know to be careful. But my code passes human and AI reviews regularly, and I take care to run multiple security evals each month just to be sure (will prob automate this once I can get a budget for another CC or codex sub).",

The projects were hacked together to be barely functional and when it was good enough there was queued work to be done, so stuff was left at barely functional.  The models are trained on best practice, and the existing code was not that.  \n\nI've spent the last month upgrading a 10 year old codebase to modern standards (or as close as possible) including the CI/CD pipelines.  Also documentation and tips and tricks to md files for LLM ramp-up.  Once the hacks are untwisted development is *much* faster... and the whole codebase is now available to be improved going forward.\n\nIt was a tough month of work, even with AI assistance, and a comparatively small codebase, so I can see why some do not see much of a speedup, but with effort it really speeds development.",

          "text": "I agree completely with the sentiment, but I'll just point out that bad quality code is not the same as tech debt. Tech debt is a very misunderstood concept. It _always_ accrues as you build a solution, because your code _always_ tends to drift from the ideal solution.\n\nBy building and observing use, you discover more about the problem. When you build the next thing to better align with your new understanding of the problem, you are building on a potentially sub-optimal foundation. As you keep doing this, your abstractions become more complex, and new features become harder to implement.\n\nEngineering to resolve tech debt seeks to realign your codebase with your new understanding of the problem. You simplify your abstractions, reduce the complexity of new features, and improve velocity again.\n\nObviously, all of this is easier if you build with and maintain a clean code structure in the first place.\n\nSorry to nitpick, but misuse of the phrase _tech debt_ is a personal bugbear. This might be a bit \"old man shouts at cloud\" but I'm old so ::shrug::. But I don't want this to take away from your comment, which again, I completely agree with!",

A few workarounds:\n\n1. **Use chat mode instead of Composer** for quick queries - chat draws from your Fast Requests pool\n2. **Batch your Composer sessions** - Make a list of changes before opening Composer, then do them all at once\n3. **Switch to Claude Code or raw API** if you need more control over which limit pool you're hitting\n\nThe frustrating part is there's no way to manually route a Composer request to your API credits. You're stuck with whatever the default is for that session.",

But, the Cursor chat window is surfacing a 'limit reached' message and forcing me to use Auto.\n\nI reached out to Cursor support (their frontline support is AI chat) and this is the response I got:\n\n\\--  \n  \n\"Hi thanks for reaching out!\n\nYou're correct that the pricing page shows $400/mo for Ultra — that's the included usage amount. The $200 is your monthly subscription price, which includes $400 worth of API usage.\n\nThe reason you're being limited despite showing $81.86 used is due to how Ultra's usage is split into two separate pools:\n\nAuto pool: Usage when Auto is selected as the model  \nAPI pool: Usage when any other model is selected (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.)\n\nYou've been using Claude Opus models (claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, claude-4.6-opus-high-thinking), which draw from your API pool. Your API pool has likely hit 100%, which is why you're being limited — even though your Total usage appears lower because your Auto pool is still available.\"\n\n\\--\n\nThis was my response:\n\n\"This usage breakdown and limiting is incredibly misleading. I can't find what you described anywhere on the pricing page or documentation. If what you are describing is publicly available please provide a direct link to it. \n\nIt's frustrating being an Ultra user at the $200 price point and still having to deal with these hidden \"gotchas\". I've been holding out on switching to Claude Code because I like Cursor and prefer a UI, but you all are making it incredibly difficult to stay. I'm going to be cancelling my subscription at the end of the month and switching to Claude Code.\"\n\n\\--\n\nNow I think I'm being forwarded to a human. \n\nBased off of how the pricing page reads determined how I was using the models. I thought I had $400 worth of Opus. Otherwise I would have been switching models more, instead of burning through the limited Opus availability. \n\nMan, this is frustrating. I love Cursor and think it's a great product be these kind of hidden usage limits are such a bad experience. If this is documented somewhere then maybe it's fair. But if not, it's BS and Cursor has lost another customer to Claude Code.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zqxlrfk6nqig1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ca66af336e3a6cbed85b66c9552a854908dde0d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t83u5fk6nqig1.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b3533b464f3f560370a89585c943b48a8c637c9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2qq1pk6nqig1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=872775c33ebe2e43d085d67776071e887472c831\n\n",

When you need the model to understand your entire codebase at once to find a bug, cramming 850k tokens into Gemini's 1M window and getting a one-shot answer is sometimes the right move.\n\nOpus 4.6 is incredible for reasoning through complex multi-step problems, but leaving it in Ask mode with extended thinking and no cost guardrails is basically handing it a blank check. I've learned to set hard budget limits per query and use the right model for the right job.\n\nFor deep debugging where the model needs to see everything: Gemini with its massive context window. For architectural decisions and careful refactoring: Opus with thinking enabled but a budget cap. For quick edits and routine code: Sonnet or Codex, where the cost per query stays reasonable.\n\nThe $120 single query tax is a painful but effective lesson in model selection. Most of us have a version of that story.",

It tends to over-analyze instead of converging on a fix – especially with ambiguous or loosely scoped tasks. Codex 5.3 is usually more deterministic and faster for cleanly defined bugs or simple refactors, even if it lacks some of Opus’s reasoning depth.  \n  \nWhen you hit this kind of wall, try breaking your problem into overly explicit subtasks with tight constraints - it can force Opus to stay focused. Also consider switching models mid-task if you notice early signs of looping or burning tokens with no output.  \n  \nIf you're still blocked, you could try something like Appstuck - it's a service for getting help when auto agents aren’t cutting it, especially for tricky bug-fixes and Vibe toolchains.",

I believe any reasonable user would be led to believe by the UI that they are doing a temporary increase. However if you increase this limit, it does not reset month to month. This means that Cursor will not warn you at all about spending.  This is a dark pattern intentionally vibe-coded by the Cursor team to deceive customers, and it has cost me $2000 this month. Customer support refuses to refund or meet anywhere in the middle, citing that this is my fault. What do you guys think? I am genuinely curious - you guys have all seen the UI.

It's unclear, and the lack of screenshots don't help. Just wanted to explain broadly what the typical understanding of \"dark pattern\" actually is, because the outcome/results doesn't matter, it's all about the intention and motivation instead.",
