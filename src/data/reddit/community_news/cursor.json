This isn't very documented, many people didn't even know about it and thought that what appeared in the cursor's web panel - tokens, tab and templates used - was all the administrators could see, so they took advantage of it to use it in side projects or even in another company. (I myself admit that I would be on this list if I hadn't promised last year that at this company I wouldn't freak out and follow the rules, everything would be cute.)\n\nHere's a warning to colleagues in the 3 jobs, take care.",

But last few weeks i realized that i was using it way less than before, not enough to justify maintaining the sub (thanks to that big model one-shotting every feature asked with proper planning).\n\nMigrated to a rust-based lighter editor, to save on the nowadays ultra precious RAM.\n\nThis industry is brutal, hard luck to you all and thanks for the ride.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1xrgj515xfg1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fa0d4512b1a883db3a2a12c5eafbec64e300b14\n\n",

I added something called /pure-ralph that spawns a terminal that acts as orchestrator which spawns individual terminals with isolated agents for each task in a PRD. It's all super early but Geoff promotes learning through iteration - watch each step and tune your infrastructure based on observation. \n\nThis is a decent resource for learning concepts, too - [https://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-ralph-wiggum](https://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-ralph-wiggum)\n\nKeeping context focused and uncompressed is a key part of it. \n\nBut yeah basically I'm still learning too but my velocity is super accelerated right now and it was already pumped from using Cursor from day 1. My pure-ralph has --manual/-m parameter so you can watch each CC terminal as it tackles each step in a PRD. Seeing where it makes mistakes and adding guardrails, instructions or tooling to help it not make the same mistakes again. Super fun.",

It orchestrates a swarm of specialized AI agents to identify security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and architectural inconsistencies in your codebase across 25+ programming languages.\n\n**The Problem We're Solving**: One of the biggest challenges we noticed with AI-assisted development—especially for non-developers using tools like Cursor—is that the generated code is often **brittle and non-secure**. Even experienced developers can't think of all the angles when building something new. That's where CodeInsight comes in: by analyzing your code from multiple specialized perspectives (security, performance, architecture, best practices and more), it helps you **deliver better, more robust code in the first iteration** rather than discovering critical issues in production.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vgnv76ehwqgg1.png?width=3842&format=png&auto=webp&s=86ffdc8df760c85ccafdc8251fdf16e9b4455c8e\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/codeinsight-ai-powered-multi-agent-code-analysis-platform-v0-4wlvrz6uvqgg1.png?width=3842&format=png&auto=webp&s=daf8151686b4273e3b2f70cdce36639645f35c4e)\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/sanaullah/CodeInsight](https://github.com/sanaullah/CodeInsight)",

I'll just have to talk to my PR department for a sec... \")  \n\\- if you try to critisize Antrophic or Claude in their Reddit channels the post gets deleted immediately. Only if you prais them, that's ok!  \n\\- while they are rate limiting they also always start campaigns where their employees post gaslighting posts where they explain \"10 techniques to effectively use Claude bla bla\" - like, why would I use Claude if I have to \"manage\" and babysit it's context with all the time I saved. Cue in the followup bot posts accusing everyone \"it isn't degraded, you're doing it wrong! Read Antrophics context management post!\"\n\nTL;DR: Don't go into bed with snakes.",

It’s very token efficient and gives AI the right approach to finding causes, then fixing them. \n- try out different models that may be equal in capability but less costly, learn how those models work and how to prompt best for them. \n- where possible, charge clients for AI usage as it’s a tool for developers.",

I'm not talking about like cracked or some like really smart, I'm talking about cracked as in someone who's actively trying to work for Microsoft and get a green card because it's so competitive. You get someone, a really cracked Ghanaian coder to work for you for around, honestly, because they probably won't go down below $250 a month. You're telling me Claude is not smarter than a Ghanaian coder making $250 a month. I'm sorry, that's just fact. Someone with 20 years experience who's been building apps for years but just can't get a green card. Claude is not better than that guy. This is one of the, I don't think it's a bubble. Like, not to mention, the fact that every time they update their code base, all the code you make from, say, six months ago is now really old because you use an old depreciated model that wasn't even smart. Like, you get what I'm saying? It's just such a bad business model when you really, really think about it. Because let's just say you're building a calculator, and you used, you know, Sonnet 1.0, Sonnet 2.2. Now we are on Sonnet 4.5. If someone builds the same app, takes a screenshot of your app, and puts it in Sonnet, they get a TI-84 while your, while your old calculator can barely do calculations. This calculation can't even go on the internet because they use Opos. A Ghanaian coder would just, hell, they can even have a $20, a Ghanaian coder with a $20 Cloud subscription could just even do a better job than using Kesha. Not even Kesha, Kesha, all these AI and their, their talking users on Kesha are a big issue, and honestly, straight up, there's a reason why banks make it hard to get a subscription there. I'm sure eventually it's gonna be one of those Chinese fake um shoes markets like Panda Buy where you can only use PayPal. Because this is crazy. I've made apps and then six months later, I ask the Cloud can one prompt create my whole app. Like, to them that's an advancement. To me, I got robbed because I paid $400 to make this app, and now you can do it one prompt for a $20 membership. That's robbery.",

Turns out the real limit (at least for me) was around **\\~520M tokens total**, which Cursor values at about **$195 worth of usage**. Most of it came from **Auto mode (\\~414M tokens)**, then a ton from **GPT-5.2 Codex (\\~82M)**, some **Claude Opus**, GPT-5.2, Sonnet, Grok, etc. Once I hit that, **Auto and Pro just stopped working completely**.\n\nPosting this because Cursor really needs a usage meter the plan is crazy generous, but not knowing when you’re about to run out is super confusing. Hope this helps someone else.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vz5y4ptwpfgg1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea7aeb1066e518d59de108403506778cd7cb5c29\n\n\n\n[Cursor $20 pro max token limit](https://preview.redd.it/pe4eh9rvpfgg1.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=4327a4645946d2fb4aa23370b7f158609207c8f6)\n\n",

      "text": "I see a lot of posts here claiming the models are getting \"stupider\" or \"lazy\" after updates. I used to have the same issue until I changed my workflow.\n\nI call it the **Columbo Method**. Yes, the 1970s TV show detective.\n\nThe philosophy is simple: Treat your codebase like a crime scene where you don't know what happened. You play the role of the confused detective. You get the agent to \"lock in on their story\" first, and only when you are absolutely sure they know the truth do you \"set the trap\" (hit Apply).\n\nHere is the exact workflow I use to save tokens, stop hallucinations, and fix complex bugs.\n\n### 1. The Investigation (Ask Mode)\n\nNever start by telling the agent to fix something. Start by acting like a confused co-worker. I always use `Ask` mode first.\n\n**The Prompt:** *\"I am logged into the app and when I click this button, it does that. It should do this. Can you review exactly how this works and look for any potential issues?\"*\n\nThis forces **retrieval**. It scans the files to answer your question, effectively loading the correct context into its window before it tries to solve anything.\n\n### 2. \"Just One More Thing...\" (Rhetorical Questions)\n\nIf the agent gives you a generic answer, don't build yet. Channel your inner Columbo and ask rhetorical questions about edge cases. You are verifying that it actually understands the logic and isn't just guessing.\n\n**The Prompt:** *\"In our current implementation, if a user does X, what happens? What happens if they also do Y? And wait, what if the network fails here?\"*\n\nKeep doing this until the explanation matches reality 100%. If it hallucinates here, it costs you nothing. If it hallucinates while coding, it costs you an hour of debugging.\n\n### 3. The Confession (Plan Mode)\n\nOnce the agent has \"locked in its story,\" switch to `Composer (Plan)` mode.\n\n**The Prompt:** *\"Create a concrete implementation plan for this fix.\"*\n\nThis generates a markdown file (like a `plan.md`). This is crucial because LLMs have recency bias. If the chat gets long, the agent might forget the start. The Plan file is a permanent anchor you can reference later. Review this manually. **If the plan is wrong, the code will be wrong.**\n\n### 4. The Execution\n\nOnly now—after the investigation, the interrogation, and the written confession—do I actually let it write code.\n\n1. Reference the Plan file.\n2. Select your smartest model (e.g., Opus 4.5 thinking).\n3. Click Build.\n\nStop trying to vibe code and start acting like a detective. It changes everything.",

      "text": "We’ve been using AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code) in production for a while now. Mid-sized team. Large codebase. Nothing exotic. But over time, our token usage kept creeping up, especially during handoffs. New dev picks up a task, asks a few “where is X implemented?” types simple questions, and suddenly the agent is pulling half the repo into context.\n\nAt first we thought this was just the cost of using AI on a big codebase. Turned out the real issue was *how context was rebuilt*.\n\nEvery query was effectively a cold start. Even if someone asked the same architectural question an hour later, the agent would:\n\n* run semantic search again\n* load the same files again\n* burn the same tokens again\n\nWe tried being disciplined with manual file tagging inside Cursor. It helped a bit, but we were still loading entire files when only small parts mattered. Cache hit rate on understanding was basically zero.\n\nThen we came across the idea of persistent architectural memory and ended up testing it in ByteRover. The mental model was simple; instead of caching answers, you cache understanding.\n\n# How it works in practice\n\nYou curate architectural knowledge once:\n\n* entry points\n* control flow\n* where core logic lives\n* how major subsystems connect\n\nThis is short, human-written context. Not auto-generated docs. Not full files. That knowledge is stored and shared across the team. When a query comes in, the agent retrieves this memory first and only inspects code if it actually needs implementation detail.\n\nSo instead of loading 10k plus tokens of source code to answer: “Where is server component rendering implemented?”\n\nThe agent gets a few hundred tokens describing the structure and entry points, then drills down selectively.\n\n# Real example from our tests\n\nWe ran the same four queries on the same large repo:\n\n* architecture exploration\n* feature addition\n* system debugging\n* build config changes\n\nManual file tagging baseline:\n\n* \\~12.5k tokens per query on average\n\nWith memory-based context:\n\n* \\~2.1k tokens per query on average\n\nThat’s about an **83% token reduction** and roughly **56% cost savings** once output tokens are factored in.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t6iyrdf3bbgg1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=420bf042cc407b7c22403d252f6920d9728dc176\n\nSystem debugging benefited the most. Those questions usually span multiple files and relationships. File-based workflows load everything upfront. Memory-based workflows retrieve structure first, then inspect only what matters.\n\n# The part that surprised me\n\nLatency became predictable. File-based context had wild variance depending on how many search passes ran. Memory-based queries were steady. Fewer spikes. Fewer “why is this taking 30 seconds” moments.\n\nAnd answers were more consistent across developers because everyone was querying the same shared understanding, not slightly different file selections.\n\n# What we didn’t have to do\n\n* No changes to application code\n* No prompt gymnastics\n* No training custom models\n\nWe just added a memory layer and pointed our agents at it.\n\nIf you want the full breakdown with numbers, charts, and the exact methodology, we wrote it up [here](https://www.byterover.dev/blog/reducing-token-usage-by-83-benchmarking-cursor-s-file-context-vs.-byterover-s-memory-layer).\n\n# When is this worth it\n\nThis only pays off if:\n\n* the codebase is large\n* multiple devs rotate across the same areas\n* AI is used daily for navigation and debugging\n\nFor small repos or solo work, file tagging is fine. But once AI becomes part of how teams understand systems, rebuilding context from scratch every time is just wasted spend.\n\nWe didn’t optimize prompts. We optimized how understanding persists. And that’s where the savings came from.",

However, the way people code is changing, and the practice of programming is moving away from the way you are thinking about it. You shouldn't feel discouraged.  \n  \nPeople used to write code in lower level languages. Higher level languages were developed to make programming easier and more powerful. With AI, we're tasked with working at an even higher level. How we do that is still being worked out. New tools are being developed. Languages are still the same, but they were actually designed for a completely different way of working, and it would not be surprising to see new languages emerge that are better suited to a different programming paradigm.  \n  \nWhat you need to know as a programmer going forward is also changing, as well as what has value. The value is moving from “can you write this function?” to “can you architect this system, debug this edge case, or design this experience?” The learning curve has moved.  \n  \nI would suggest changing your focus, and shift to learning the skills that will help you be a better programmer in this new paradigm. Learn to review code. Learn about design and architecture. Learn how to break down a project, and direct its development. Learn how to communicate intent.  And pay close attention to new developments. Things are changing fast.  \n  \nYou joined at a moment of transformation. That’s not the worst time. It's exciting and uncertain. But the job won't be to write code in lower level languages than you need to, just like we don't typically write code in assembly.",

Never tried Cursors own planning / task management - mainly because this one works nearly flawless for me. Migth also be to the scope and language of my projects (mainly cli tools in python).\n\nBut inside Cursor, after all is setup - all i do is start a new chat, prompt \"implement next task\" - and then it runs sometimes for half an hour. I had to finetune the mcp files a bit, but essentially each task is split into dozen of subtasks of course, detailed explanation (all done by task-master) and there are always include test writing, running tests until everything works, updating documentation, commiting. Once the agent stops i just review, then open a new chat and start again.  \nContext grows sometimes to 50-70% of this little circle - but as i rarely have to prompt again once the agent stops, i just open a new chat to clean the context.\n\nAnd so far its way superiour than i did without it - i nearly dont have to do those bug hunting sessions anymore where you realize it was going off the rails inbetween and you didnt noticed - or it just implemented something twice, slightly different, because it didnt realized we did this already.",

But now, Cursor itself is pretty smart when prompted correctly (wich the tools are doing) to really just grab the pieces of code it needs.  \nAs i have an entry point each time (a full doc about where things live, how its structured, how functions connect etc.) just for the ai - it reads this at the start of each task and then knows exactly where to look.

You code the 'Laws of the Land' once, and then you don't need a 'Task-Master' to remind the AI how to behave—the environment itself enforces it. Aren't you basically just manually doing what the MDC was designed to automate?",

The most frustrating part is that even when I get back to the layout I like, I can't tell you how I did it. Every other day, the settings for the layout seems to change location.

You can mouse over the token amount and see how much were input/output tokens and how much were cache read and write tokens. Most likely you have majority as cache read tokens. \n\nTo reduce cost for you we utilize caching and the cache read tokens are 90% cheaper than input tokens. \n\nSuggestion:\n- use shorter chats focused on a single specific task.\n- for very complex tasks use Plan mode with a stronger model then start new chat with a regular model to implement the plan. \n- check and cleanup rules as current models require less rules. Only add them if you see a model misses something consistently. \n- avoid attaching files and rules manually. Let agent discover context since it’s more efficient",

Got carried away a bit with it. Use a preset or color picker and grab the prompt, also got froggy with attempting to get a Hero Styler and Text Styler, but those are buggy as all get out.  It was really fun having the agents go wild, hardest coaxing was getting tailwind to have include list for unused styles in the build. Really falling in love with building again.",

Doing so could help reduce our reliance on expensive options like Opus or GPT models and significantly lower costs.\n\nFrom what I’ve heard, these open-source models are already quite strong. They just require more baby sitting and supervision to produce consistent, high-quality outputs, which is completely acceptable for engineering-heavy use cases like ours.\n\nIf anyone from the cursor team has insights on this, it would be really helpful.\n\ncurrently i use both Cursor and GitHub Copilot, both does not provide oss models yet, idk why, isn't this known as gate-keeping?\n\nAnyway thanks, and keep shipping!",

Also, they probably do have deals with openAI / Claude for cheaper API pricing, and these deals might include some clauses against OSS models.\n\n2) Cursor tries not to blindly add models, and each model they have might have tweaks with prompt/tools, which means that adding new models is longer process that to just add a provider + specify model name. Cursor team claims that m2.1/GLM 4.7 do not pass their internal evals, up to you to believe that or not.\n\n3) Related to previous but a bit separate, there seems to be some skill issues on dev team with OSS models. They, somehow, managed to add kimi k2 with a bug(it output a new line for each token) and they don't want to spend dev time on learning how to properly add models.",

You get to keep using Cursor, but with a much better memory.\n\nIf you want to try it out, you can run the global install via:\n\n    npm install -g @getvibeguard/cli\n\nThen just type\n\n`vibeguard init`\n\nin your folder and you are ready to go.",
