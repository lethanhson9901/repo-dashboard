I accidentally clicked into Cursor’s **annual Ultra subscription** (over **$2,000**) and support is refusing to refund me because they claim the plan had “recorded usage” once it started. I reached out quickly, explained it was a misclick, and even asked for a **prorated refund** for the unused time, but they still said no. For a charge this large, the upgrade flow feels way too easy to trigger by mistake. Has anyone else dealt with this? Did support ever make an exception, give a prorated refund, or only respond after escalation/public posts/charge dispute?\n\nMods: I have invoices and screenshots of the email for anyone that needs proof.

The agent is running on its own, making architecture decisions, shipping code while you're doing something else.\n\n  \nThe bet is that speed gains from autonomous agents outweigh the cost of fixing their mistakes. But right now there's no good tooling for the \"fixing mistakes\" part. You find out the agent made a bad decision when something breaks in prod, not when the decision was made.\n\n  \nBefore cloud agents actually work we need structured observability.

              "text": "I always start with building the UI, and I mostly rely on open-source design systems because I don't want to use a lot of tokens recreating already existing components. So, I built this app using Material 3 from Google, and the way that I built it was that I created the whole UI, and then I started planning each feature that would be the functionality of that UI. Because I was doing a feature-first architecture, I was working with parallel agents to be able to implement features super fast because each feature had their own folder structure, and even inside of that folder structure, I broke it down into more folders because I wanted to have speed, and I wanted the agents not to clash with each other when they are editing multiple files. So, this was like a strategic move that I chose to do.   \n  \nIf you take a look at the repo, you can see that there are a lot of like breaking down of different files, and there could be that was enabling me to be able to have multiple agents working at the same time. From time to time, it was like five to six agents working at the same time on the same feature, but because it was separate files, it wouldn't clash with each other and wouldn't like collapse.  \n  \nI also chose Flutter to build this because Flutter is a high-level language. It has shorter syntax and shorter code structure, and this would cause me to use less tokens for input and output to get more context and more feature capability. This way, like when I was getting a lot of context with like 50% less token than like React because of shorter syntaxes, and when it wanted to write it, it had to write less code, so the speed was faster overall. So choosing Flutter as my framework was a strategic decision that I made.  \n  \nIt is worth mentioning that I did not have like a master prompt for creating the whole thing. I broke it down and decomposed it in my head, and I just started building it from the parts that I thought should come first. So, first was UI, then was main functionalities, then the native bridge for recording voice, sending it to Gemini, and then the transcription, and then refining the prompt engineering and so on and so on.  \n  \nI usually opened the chat of Cursor Agent in edit panel mode so I can have four to five chats open as columns, and then I could see all of them, and I could prompt them simultaneously. I didn't type anything; I just started speech-to-text the whole thing, and that was increasing my speed overall.  \n  \nThis was written by [openyapper.com](http://openyapper.com)",

              "text": "Exactly. That was the whole point of making this post because I wanted to say that the plan mode and composer are both features and models that Cursor put together, and they are complementary to each other, and they should be used together rather than separately. I think Composer works really well with the plan mode, as it is better than architecting and researching before applying things, but sometimes it could jump steps and go through the code base and start building something that doesn't work.   \n  \nThe way that it is handling voice data is that it's just recording your voice, sending it to the model, deleting the voice, and not saving it anywhere, and then the transcription is the only thing that gets saved on your documents folder on your own device and be pasted in the text field wherever you are working. And it doesn't ship it to any third party or any where to be stored, and it doesn't store the audio file. It just deletes it. It does handle the mic permissions. It asks you for mic permission and accessibility permissions wen you start running the app because it needs to have accessibility for pasting inside of whatever app and get the context from the whatever app you are using from the native bridge of the app.   \n  \nAnd this was like thought through before being implemented. So, I personally thought about the whole thing, like the whole scope of what I was going to build, and then I started building it. This was written by [openyapper.com](http://openyapper.com)",

Most people who struggle with AI coding are not limited by the model -- they are limited by the fact that they are using the model to figure out what they want to build at the same time as building it. Those two things fight each other constantly.\n\nThe plan mode forcing that upfront clarity is probably more valuable than the model quality itself for most projects. You essentially had a working spec before a line of code was written. That is what Cursor is actually good at accelerating -- implementation of a well-defined thing. It is not a substitute for defining the thing.",

And when it comes to an action decision, how does it execute that action? I'm guessing it uses some library or something to automate. Where the agent just picks the tool \"yeah click that button\" or like in the Voyager paper it writes the code to \"click that button\" using something like Selenium or similar? Or was reinforcement learning used to actually guide the cursor to where it needs to go? I doubt it or?\n\nI feel like the moat you have here is with the engineering infrastructure. If it's not a secret I would love to hear of how you \"architecturally\" achieved the things I'm curious about if you find the time to answer :) Because I'm trying something similar right now for my master's thesis but using it to play turn-based video games like magic the gathering, Yugioh or Civilization 6, that's why I'm so curious about the process.",

We give the agent new tools, like using the computer, and recording video demos, and the agent decides when to call those tools. The computer using capabilities are defined by the model you pick - the latest generation of models (Opus/Codex/etc) are all really good at this. We built a custom video renderer in Rust to get it exactly right (with the pans, zooms, speeding up the slower parts while the agent is thinking) and even adding the watermark on the end of the videos.",

When an agent has full computer access and merges code, someone still needs to know: what did it decide to do, what did it try that failed, and what did it quietly simplify?

      "text": "i need to tell someone about this because my coworkers dont fully appreciate what happened.\n\nwe had a legacy auth system built 3 years ago by a contractor who is long gone. session-based, no refresh tokens, passwords stored with MD5 (yes really), and the middleware was spaghetti that nobody wanted to touch. migrating to JWT + OAuth had been on the backlog for 6 months because the estimate was 2 sprints of dedicated work.\n\nyesterday i decided to just try it in cursor. i spent about 90 seconds talking through the full requirements and constraints into a voice dictation software - Willow Voice - so i had a clear spec, pasted that in with the existing auth files referenced, and asked cursor to migrate to JWT with refresh tokens, bcrypt password hashing, and google OAuth.\n\nit generated the entire migration. new middleware, updated routes, token refresh logic, google OAuth callback handler, database migration for the password hash column. i reviewed every line carefully (obviously) and found 2 issues, both minor. the refresh token rotation had a race condition in concurrent requests and the OAuth state parameter wasnt being validated.\n\ni fixed those, wrote tests, and had the whole thing deployed to staging by 4pm. it passed QA this morning.\n\na migration that was estimated at 2 sprints took one afternoon. the code is cleaner than what we had before. my tech lead asked me how long it took and when i said \"\"about 4 hours\"\" he didnt believe me until i showed him the git log.\n\ncursor isnt replacing developers. but its compressing certain categories of work from weeks to hours. the kind of work where the patterns are well-established and the challenge is mostly volume and careful implementation, not creative problem solving.\n\nanyone else had a moment where cursor dramatically exceeded your expectations?",

You still needed to review every line carefully (as you did), understand the migration, and own the outcome. The difference is that the blank-page problem disappears and the time-to-reviewable-code shrinks from weeks to hours. The voice dictation to get a clear spec first is a smart habit too. A lot of bad AI output comes from vague prompts rather than model limitations.",

      "text": "We had this funny moment recently where a feature that used to be a 2 week “engineering effort” turned into like an afternoon. Cursor did the boring parts as always, tests got written, docs got stubbed, the whole thing looked done\n\nThen it sat for 12 days\n\nNot because anyone was lazy(i mean everyone is sometimes but this one took more time than exected to move on). It was the same stuff that always slows us down, but it got way more obvious once writing the code stopped taking time\n\nWhat held it up(at least it what happens most of the time):\n\n* product kept changing the acceptance criteria because once the prototype existed, everyone had opinions\n* security had questions about data flow and retention, which were legit\n* analytics wanted events renamed, then renamed again\n* legal wanted wording changes in the UI copy\n* release train was locked because we had a hotfix window and nobody wanted extra risk\n\nSo yes, my local loop feels faster. The calendar barely moves\n\nI also noticed a second effect that’s kinda annoying. AI makes it cheap to create 3 versions of a solution. That sounds good, but it increases decision load. People see options and want to debate them. Before, the cost of rewriting things kept everyone aligned. Now the cost is near zero, so you get more churn\n\nI’ve been trying to adapt the workflow around that, not around codegen fully tho\n\nso instead of “pick the smartest model” what we;re doing:\n\n1. Define “done” before the code exists If you ship a working prototype too early, it becomes a magnet for scope creep. We now try to lock a small acceptance checklist first, even if it’s ugly\n2. Ship a thin slice that reduces stakeholder surface area We used to do “feature complete” PRs. Now we do “merge a boring slice” PRs. A small backend flag, a minimal UI state, and we let the rest wait until approvals are clear\n3. Make review faster because review is a real gate Not a huge process overhaul, just making sure PRs are easier to consume. I’ve been using CodeRabbit locally as a quick diff sanity pass before I even open the PR, mostly to catch stuff that triggers long review threads (naming drift, inconsistent error handling, tests that pass but don’t prove the thing). It’s basically a pre-PR cleanup step for me.\n4. Stop pretending “velocity” is code output DORA’s ([article](https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) framing helps here. Lead time for changes and deployment frequency don’t magically improve because someone typed faster. If the gates are reviews, CI, approvals, and release process, that’s where the time is.\n\nI think this is why you can have devs feeling 2x faster and the org still moves the same. Code got cheaper, everything else became the bottleneck.\n\nAlso, if you saw that OX Security budget drain story ([here](https://www.ox.security/blog/two-clicks-to-1m-how-attackers-can-drain-enterprise-budgets-through-ai-platforms/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), it’s another reminder that these tools are powerful in ways that don’t map to normal controls. We treat them like “just dev tooling” but they behave more like production infrastructure sometimes",

It’ll happily build whatever you ask — including the wrong thing.\n2. **Deciding how to build it.** Architecture choices compound. Pick wrong early, and the AI will build quickly on a bad foundation. You won’t notice until session 30.\n3. **Reviewing what was built.** The AI writes fast. Fast and correct aren’t the same thing. Security gaps, subtle edge cases, integration conflicts with code it didn’t read.\n\nI started logging every architecture decision in a markdown file. 77 decisions in. That file? More valuable than the code. The code can be regenerated in an afternoon. The reasoning behind it can’t.\n\nUncomfortable truth: if you’re good at coding but bad at decisions and orchestration, AI just makes you faster at the wrong things.",

The 12 days your feature sat is not a process failure, it is the normal cost of getting distributed humans to agree on anything. What AI has done is made the bottleneck visible. Before, the 'two week engineering effort' masked the fact that alignment was the real work. Now that the code takes an afternoon the organizational debt becomes impossible to ignore, which might actually be the most useful thing AI has done for engineering teams whether they realize it or not.",

The part about decision load is huge since the near-zero cost of generating options has empowered stakeholders to nitpick every version until we are drowning in churn. To survive this I have leaned into the orchestrator role by using separate agent sessions as adversarial reviewers to catch naming drift or security gaps before any human even sees the prototype. It doesn't fix the legal bottleneck but it ensures the engineering side is bulletproof enough to reduce the surface area for critiques. We are basically becoming architects who have to manage both silicon agents and human stakeholders simultaneously.",

That’s what the idiots at the top are trying to peddle, but in reality we need to be investing our time into this to beat back that rhetoric. The quality of my ideas and the comprehensive plans I can lay out are the point. A 6 month project is going to be a six month project regardless of AI usage. Nowadays I can allocate wayyy more time to the planning phase and rapidly iterate POCs to figure out the art of the possible (we’re building out complex recommendation systems for e-commerce these days so if us normie MLOps Engineers can put that into production then those crud apps are somewhat trivial no matter how fancy your partitioning/caching strategy may be). I can take that POC now and spend 90% of my time scrutinizing and collecting feedback on the EXACT specs so that we don’t inevitably run into the “gotcha” that lights many ideas on fire.\n\nAnd tbh I could probably do my job way more efficiently if it was me/myself and I without too much data complexity. But that’s short-sighted: you also need to train people up and form relationships and establish a presence in your company. You have to form relationships between departments so that you don’t have to be the expert in more than just a handful of domains. You have to actively be researching new trends and challenging the paradigms that you base your systems on/libraries that you implement.  That’s what separates the vibe coder allowing the agent to randomly pip install things as opposed to a seasoned AI developer that doesn’t even think twice about manually planning and crafting their pyproject.toml dependencies/configs before even touching a line of code.\n\nPoint is, the people who most reluctant to this change are the people who have been able to thrive in the IC line-by-line environment. Maybe I’m selling my skills short and I’m just at that point, but I highly doubt 5 years of experience in the industry is putting me that much farther than any other shmuck using AI correctly. BUT it is painfully obvious just at an intellectual level the people who are leaning in and experimenting.\n\nThis goes up to the highest technical seniors… some of the gurus are taking our cursor sub and running with it and I’m actively helping them create skills and rules based off THEIR best practices so that they can focus more time tackling the truly complex data science projects that AI can really only augment the development of. And this goes even further because now those staff engineers now have time freed up to share these novel and theoretical ideas instead of telling the juniors for the umpteenth time to stop vibe coding and lay out their requirements clearly before throwing it into cursor.\n\nSo yeah I’m not 10x because of a thing as trivial as plugging characters into a black box. There are so many more things that AI can help with that tab completion over agentic workflows feels like a kind of silly detail of one part of the job to fixate on.",

I used to have like /project_a_variant1, /project_a_variant2, /project_a_variant3 in parallel to the \"main\" /project_a and let agents work in the 1, 2, 3 checkouts and then merge from /project_a. It's not worth the work for me. If you use worktree, it'd be similar, especially with direct support from tools now.",

If two agents can touch the same module, you will get conflicts that are annoying to untangle.\n\nThe verification agent idea is underrated. We added a lightweight check step that just reads the diff and flags anything that touches files outside the expected scope before committing. Catches drift early without slowing things down much.\n\nOne thing worth adding to your list: have each agent write a brief summary of what it changed to a task-specific notes file. Reviewing three one-paragraph diffs is much faster than three full git diffs when you are trying to understand what happened across a parallel run. Sounds minor but it saves real time.",

Character wandering means it's done.\n\nEverything is clickable - toggle the lamp, open curtains, cycle through Space Invaders, Tetris, and Pong on the tiny arcade screen.

I used Cursor for maybe 10 prompts on a brand new project. That cost me $30 in one day and burned 5.5% of my entire monthly limit on the $200 plan. That’s barely using it.\n\nThis pricing just doesn’t make sense.\n\nI used Claude Code all month on the $100 plan and never even came close to maxing out. A friend of mine bought the $60 Cursor plan and maxed it out in 8 hours with light usage.\n\nPeople will say just use a cheaper model. That’s not realistic if you’re actually building something serious. If the only way the product is affordable is by downgrading to weaker models, then it’s not really built for real dev work.\n\nLast month I spent over $1,000 on Cursor. I had multiple single prompts cost over $25. One prompt literally said “Look for possible security issues in my app.” That one cost me $38.\n\nSupport told me I used 32 million tokens on that single prompt using Opus 4.6.\n\n32 million tokens for a security scan.\n\nI had my own API key set up in the IDE and they didn’t even use it. I honestly thought there was some kind of cap per chat, maybe 200k or even 1M tokens. Apparently not.\n\nAnd before anyone says I was careless, I was starting new chats every 3 to 4 messages specifically to keep context small. It didn’t matter.\n\nWhat makes it worse is that a lot of those expensive prompts needed follow up prompts to fix things. So you pay premium prices and then you pay again to correct it.\n\nThat’s not sustainable.\n\nAnd customer support is basically an AI bot that says too bad, that was on demand usage, you should have paid attention.\n\nAt this point Cursor just isn’t usable for serious developers. The costs are unpredictable and there are no real guardrails to prevent runaway token usage. That’s the core issue.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6rzmsg0r4mg1.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=59f9826c7b2ef8b4d7817b9b2bd5d334ba6443e7\n\n",

It took a prompt which searched the web a few times for the game's rules, then I made a refinement prompt, and performed the build. It made an ugly, but completely functional, game for $0.29 (twenty nine cents).\n\nHonestly, it would've been $0.04 cents cheaper, but I accidentally closed the plan window and I hadn't saved the plan file so I had to ask it to re-open the plan file.

Yes. Will it be a spaghetti mess with raw dictionary access, 1 huge ass file with no architecture design or structure, also yes.\n\nDesign your app, the features and module boundaries and all the normal swe stuff you should be doing. It's slower, more methodical and will scale way better than the isnta-techdebt you generate with no guidance other than \"make it work\"\n\nLastly, have the cursor analytics dashboard up while you work, it will help you calibrate your intuition about what prompts are gonna cost and you should start being able to guess how long/expensive each prompt should be, and if it's taking longer than you expect, time to stop and deep dive - you forgot something, didn't give it clear instructions, made assumptions that conflict with reality or occasionally it's just an idiot and going about it in a stupid way.",

Got what seems like right before the boom ended and before AI tools really took over. I use to use VScode almost exclusively. I switched to cursor professionally around the end of 2025 when our company got us licenses for it. Since then its all i've used professionally and personally with my side projects.   \n  \nI've tried claude code and it's fine but I like the traditional IDE experience. Anti-Gravity I think has real potential and I like that the limit resets every 5 hours and weekly. But the one thing keeping back hooked on cursor is the almost unlimited scope of composer.  For the work I do, it's almost just as good as the larger scale models. With cursor, it doesn't feel like I need to go much more past the $20 a month plan.",

I'm not happy about the state of GPT 5.3, I feel like it's lost it a bit. But I used to use GPT for all C# backend stuff before. \n\nIve been implementing AI into my workflow since 2022, when GPT was originally released, so I've seen it all pretty much. The improvements we have made are absolutely crazy. I have a very unpopular opinion when it comes to this, but you can get any model to work if your prompts are good enough. There is no such thing as \"bad models\" anymore. The most important thing right now are the tools surrounding the models, and what you prefer personally. And cost obviously.\n\nThe biggest difference now in my opinion is how well a model handles \"bad prompts\". Which obviously would be a big factor for inexperienced developers.",
