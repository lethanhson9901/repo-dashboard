If 1.5 is priced at Sonnet-level but doesn't meaningfully close the gap with Opus or GPT-5.3 Codex on complex multi-file edits, the value prop gets murky.\n\nI've been using Opus 4.6 for backend/architecture work and Gemini 3 Pro for UI. The model-switching workflow is slightly annoying but the results are significantly better than using one model for everything. Composer 1 filled the \"quick edit, fast iteration\" slot perfectly at its price point.\n\nThe real question is whether 1.5 is good enough to replace the premium models for complex tasks, or just too expensive for the simple ones. That middle ground is hard to justify when you can already switch models per task.",

Similar reason services like chatgpt removed gpt4o as those models were huge and costed a lot to run so were costing the services a lot, in the chatgpt case once deepseek launched MOE it became clear that they could make their own MOE models which would perform similar to 4o but cost 1/10th the price. In this case with composer 1.5 I don't know if the model size changed but they may have to adjust pricing so its actually profitable for them.   \n  \nI understand this change and if Composer 1.5 is still as fast as 1 then it will be worth it. For straight forward changes composer 1 often worked better than even opus 4.5 so as long as composer 1.5 complies it may still have use even with this increased price although this pricing pushes them into the territory of all the other model providers so it REALLY has to be good now.",

I'll keep brainstorming and planning until all of 3 of us (opus, codex, and me) reach consensus. Then I'll let opus 4.6 fast execute code. And then I'll have code validate everything.\n\nMy primary issues with 5.3 codex x max high: sometimes hard to comprehend + speed.

Cursor will likely lose a lot of users in the future because there will be little value in coding with cheaper models.  You already see this happening, Opus 4.5 isn't cheap and yet who would build anything significant on anything else?\n\nPeople aren't going to be able to afford to learn the high end models that companies want to hire for without a significant investment.  \n\nThere is no future where the cutting edge model is also the most affordable.  This means a lot less users for products like Cursor, at some point - probably this year.  This is why I believe they don't really care about their current customers.",

It will even check if we have DB indexes setup already, related schemas, and interact with AWS using some other scripts if I allow it to. \n\nIt took like a day to build these.

      "text": "I keep seeing YouTube videos and news reports claiming that AI hasn’t really improved programmer productivity, and I honestly find that hard to believe. A common claim is that AI boosts productivity for junior developers but actually *reduces* productivity for senior devs.\n\nThat makes me wonder: am I secretly a junior in disguise, or are people just dumb and not using AI very effectively?\n\nPersonally, I’ve found AI to be a huge productivity boost. As I’ve gained more experience using it—and as the models themselves have improved—I’ve noticed I’m making fewer mistakes, not more. While people often say “AI writes bad code,” even setting code generation aside, the gains from faster debugging, troubleshooting, research, and environment setup feel very real.\n\nFor example, I recently ran into MySQL Workbench issues after an upgrade. ChatGPT helped me diagnose and fix it in about 15 minutes. Years ago, that would’ve meant trawling through docs and Stack Overflow threads for hours.\n\nCurious what others think, especially senior devs. Has AI actually hurt your productivity, or does it depend on how you use it? Why is there this narrative that it's not helping with productivity??",

They are definitely coding faster and building cool internal tools. **However**, our official project timelines? **Zero change.**\n\n**Why?** Because in a corporate environment, 'writing code' was never the bottleneck. The bottleneck is alignment, meetings, PR reviews, CI/CD pipelines, legacy integration, and compliance.\n\nAI made the 'typing' part instant, but it didn't solve the organizational friction.

For example, there may be some code refactoring or cleanup that we can whip through quickly and just get done. There's not necessarily any immediate impact for end users or for bottom line revenues - the benefit comes 8 years later when a junior developer has to write a new method and it's easier for her because someone else cleaned up the code 8 years prior.

Some findings don't fit our architecture and flows exactly since we have some hacky ways of doing things, but we just create a rule when that happens to clean it up. \n\nI'm separately building a ground up new version of one of our core apps in completely diff environment (vercel for now, instead of AWS) and just connecting to our APIs for data. Its in classic ai stack of node (not next), react, typescript, tailwind. I have been using AI tools since early 2023 so I have a pretty rock solid environment setup for it. I built all of our existing functionality in about 3 weeks and am now enhancing and expanding things building in features our customers have wanted for years, but we're difficult or impossible to build in our legacy app. Frontend is super quick, like multiple releases a week, and backend stuff is still pretty fast when I need to make changes. Main bottleneck there is testing and review for anything that might touch DB or handle sensitive pii/phi, and managing AWS environment for a few things that deal with those services. \n\nIt's crazy because I am not a dev and only have about 2.5yrs of comp sci under my belt (2005-2007, so we were just getting deep into JavaScript when I switched majors). I am very technical, building PCs and doing script kiddie shit from childhood, and was a senior server and network admin for many years, so I understand things at a high level and know to be careful. But my code passes human and AI reviews regularly, and I take care to run multiple security evals each month just to be sure (will prob automate this once I can get a budget for another CC or codex sub).",

Once the hacks are untwisted development is *much* faster... and the whole codebase is now available to be improved going forward.\n\nIt was a tough month of work, even with AI assistance, and a comparatively small codebase, so I can see why some do not see much of a speedup, but with effort it really speeds development.",

It _always_ accrues as you build a solution, because your code _always_ tends to drift from the ideal solution.\n\nBy building and observing use, you discover more about the problem. When you build the next thing to better align with your new understanding of the problem, you are building on a potentially sub-optimal foundation. As you keep doing this, your abstractions become more complex, and new features become harder to implement.\n\nEngineering to resolve tech debt seeks to realign your codebase with your new understanding of the problem. You simplify your abstractions, reduce the complexity of new features, and improve velocity again.\n\nObviously, all of this is easier if you build with and maintain a clean code structure in the first place.\n\nSorry to nitpick, but misuse of the phrase _tech debt_ is a personal bugbear. This might be a bit \"old man shouts at cloud\" but I'm old so ::shrug::. But I don't want this to take away from your comment, which again, I completely agree with!",

Most of my time passed with fixing their errors than programming new stuff. Ai will help yes but it will not become new guy who fixes every little thing daily.

That said it is a fair bit slower than cursor agents so if it's a quick question I'll use cursor but for the most part I use claude code. Clause code also seems better at hard to find bugs.\n\nThat being said my flow is very spec driven and most of my work is very brown field in a large codebase with tight SLAs so I spend vastly more time planning than coding and the coding I do is usually fairly simple once the spec is defined well so either would probably be fine there.\n\nThe only feature I really like cursor for is inline edits for quick changes or log lines.

It tends to over-analyze instead of converging on a fix – especially with ambiguous or loosely scoped tasks. Codex 5.3 is usually more deterministic and faster for cleanly defined bugs or simple refactors, even if it lacks some of Opus’s reasoning depth.  \n  \nWhen you hit this kind of wall, try breaking your problem into overly explicit subtasks with tight constraints - it can force Opus to stay focused. Also consider switching models mid-task if you notice early signs of looping or burning tokens with no output.  \n  \nIf you're still blocked, you could try something like Appstuck - it's a service for getting help when auto agents aren’t cutting it, especially for tricky bug-fixes and Vibe toolchains.",
