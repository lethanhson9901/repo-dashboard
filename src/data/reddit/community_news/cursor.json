I'll just have to talk to my PR department for a sec... \")  \n\\- if you try to critisize Antrophic or Claude in their Reddit channels the post gets deleted immediately. Only if you prais them, that's ok!  \n\\- while they are rate limiting they also always start campaigns where their employees post gaslighting posts where they explain \"10 techniques to effectively use Claude bla bla\" - like, why would I use Claude if I have to \"manage\" and babysit it's context with all the time I saved. Cue in the followup bot posts accusing everyone \"it isn't degraded, you're doing it wrong! Read Antrophics context management post!\"\n\nTL;DR: Don't go into bed with snakes.",

It’s very token efficient and gives AI the right approach to finding causes, then fixing them. \n- try out different models that may be equal in capability but less costly, learn how those models work and how to prompt best for them. \n- where possible, charge clients for AI usage as it’s a tool for developers.",

I'm not talking about like cracked or some like really smart, I'm talking about cracked as in someone who's actively trying to work for Microsoft and get a green card because it's so competitive. You get someone, a really cracked Ghanaian coder to work for you for around, honestly, because they probably won't go down below $250 a month. You're telling me Claude is not smarter than a Ghanaian coder making $250 a month. I'm sorry, that's just fact. Someone with 20 years experience who's been building apps for years but just can't get a green card. Claude is not better than that guy. This is one of the, I don't think it's a bubble. Like, not to mention, the fact that every time they update their code base, all the code you make from, say, six months ago is now really old because you use an old depreciated model that wasn't even smart. Like, you get what I'm saying? It's just such a bad business model when you really, really think about it. Because let's just say you're building a calculator, and you used, you know, Sonnet 1.0, Sonnet 2.2. Now we are on Sonnet 4.5. If someone builds the same app, takes a screenshot of your app, and puts it in Sonnet, they get a TI-84 while your, while your old calculator can barely do calculations. This calculation can't even go on the internet because they use Opos. A Ghanaian coder would just, hell, they can even have a $20, a Ghanaian coder with a $20 Cloud subscription could just even do a better job than using Kesha. Not even Kesha, Kesha, all these AI and their, their talking users on Kesha are a big issue, and honestly, straight up, there's a reason why banks make it hard to get a subscription there. I'm sure eventually it's gonna be one of those Chinese fake um shoes markets like Panda Buy where you can only use PayPal. Because this is crazy. I've made apps and then six months later, I ask the Cloud can one prompt create my whole app. Like, to them that's an advancement. To me, I got robbed because I paid $400 to make this app, and now you can do it one prompt for a $20 membership. That's robbery.",

Turns out the real limit (at least for me) was around **\\~520M tokens total**, which Cursor values at about **$195 worth of usage**. Most of it came from **Auto mode (\\~414M tokens)**, then a ton from **GPT-5.2 Codex (\\~82M)**, some **Claude Opus**, GPT-5.2, Sonnet, Grok, etc. Once I hit that, **Auto and Pro just stopped working completely**.\n\nPosting this because Cursor really needs a usage meter the plan is crazy generous, but not knowing when you’re about to run out is super confusing. Hope this helps someone else.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vz5y4ptwpfgg1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea7aeb1066e518d59de108403506778cd7cb5c29\n\n\n\n[Cursor $20 pro max token limit](https://preview.redd.it/pe4eh9rvpfgg1.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=4327a4645946d2fb4aa23370b7f158609207c8f6)\n\n",

      "text": "I see a lot of posts here claiming the models are getting \"stupider\" or \"lazy\" after updates. I used to have the same issue until I changed my workflow.\n\nI call it the **Columbo Method**. Yes, the 1970s TV show detective.\n\nThe philosophy is simple: Treat your codebase like a crime scene where you don't know what happened. You play the role of the confused detective. You get the agent to \"lock in on their story\" first, and only when you are absolutely sure they know the truth do you \"set the trap\" (hit Apply).\n\nHere is the exact workflow I use to save tokens, stop hallucinations, and fix complex bugs.\n\n### 1. The Investigation (Ask Mode)\n\nNever start by telling the agent to fix something. Start by acting like a confused co-worker. I always use `Ask` mode first.\n\n**The Prompt:** *\"I am logged into the app and when I click this button, it does that. It should do this. Can you review exactly how this works and look for any potential issues?\"*\n\nThis forces **retrieval**. It scans the files to answer your question, effectively loading the correct context into its window before it tries to solve anything.\n\n### 2. \"Just One More Thing...\" (Rhetorical Questions)\n\nIf the agent gives you a generic answer, don't build yet. Channel your inner Columbo and ask rhetorical questions about edge cases. You are verifying that it actually understands the logic and isn't just guessing.\n\n**The Prompt:** *\"In our current implementation, if a user does X, what happens? What happens if they also do Y? And wait, what if the network fails here?\"*\n\nKeep doing this until the explanation matches reality 100%. If it hallucinates here, it costs you nothing. If it hallucinates while coding, it costs you an hour of debugging.\n\n### 3. The Confession (Plan Mode)\n\nOnce the agent has \"locked in its story,\" switch to `Composer (Plan)` mode.\n\n**The Prompt:** *\"Create a concrete implementation plan for this fix.\"*\n\nThis generates a markdown file (like a `plan.md`). This is crucial because LLMs have recency bias. If the chat gets long, the agent might forget the start. The Plan file is a permanent anchor you can reference later. Review this manually. **If the plan is wrong, the code will be wrong.**\n\n### 4. The Execution\n\nOnly now—after the investigation, the interrogation, and the written confession—do I actually let it write code.\n\n1. Reference the Plan file.\n2. Select your smartest model (e.g., Opus 4.5 thinking).\n3. Click Build.\n\nStop trying to vibe code and start acting like a detective. It changes everything.",

Cursor will likely lose a lot of users in the future because there will be little value in coding with cheaper models.  You already see this happening, Opus 4.5 isn't cheap and yet who would build anything significant on anything else?\n\nPeople aren't going to be able to afford to learn the high end models that companies want to hire for without a significant investment.  \n\nThere is no future where the cutting edge model is also the most affordable.

It will even check if we have DB indexes setup already, related schemas, and interact with AWS using some other scripts if I allow it to. \n\nIt took like a day to build these. But I am not an engineer by trade. That said, my lead engineer on the API and DB both reviewed and approved the skills and outputs after some minor feedback, so that was reassuring!",

Don’t get me wrong, I hate paying for cursor too.\n\nThe closest I’d say out of all of them that have this context awareness is windsurf. You can tell it does have some deeper searching abilities over just grep. However cursor really perfected this total awareness and that’s why they have a monopoly and can charge as much as they do.

I think one of the biggest advantages is its ability to spawn sub agents and actually monitor and respond to builds. GPT and Opus would always say \"I'll monitor the build\" in Cursor, but it never worked. I was always telling it, \"it finished\" or \"there was an error\". Using Claude Code in Powershell it actually works. Saving me tons of time.\n\nAlso, I have some guest passes for one free week of Claude if you want to try it out. https://claude.ai/referral/IszzqSDf_w",

Today I'm using my $200 plan and I've already passed $60 of usage so I'm trying to just work in Auto mode to save money, but since I did that it still seems to be rising at about the same pace.\n\nIs everyone experiencing the same thing? I know my project has gotten rather large but I'm trying to make my queries very focused on one specific issue at a time but each query still seems to cost a decent amount of money.\n\nIs the issue that I simply need to create a new convo because the one I'm in is simply just bleeding cash or is this just the new state of Cursor as a whole?\n\n\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*: Okay I spoke with support and they clarified the issue. Ever since they've allowed indexing a convo, I've kind of just been running the same convo for like a month straight. THIS is absolutely killing my bill. The cached convo tokens are like 5x the usage of every other thing I'm doing.\n\nBasically by maintaining the same convo, I'm causing myself to have exponentially higher costs with every message I send no matter how small it is.\n\nI knew this was how it used to work but I assumed once the indexing process started this was no longer an issue but actually it's a bigger issue than ever because it causes people like my to let convos go on for WAY too long.\n\nThey also let me know that the $200 plan allows for $400 of usage which also made me feel better.\n\nNot to be a huge ass kisser but I was very happy with their very fast response and full explanation of my specific issue so thank you Cursor team!\n\n  \n\\*\\*Edit\\*\\*: [PSA: Indexing Your Conversational Context DOES NOT Index Your Cost! : r/cursor](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1qv5903/psa_indexing_your_conversational_context_does_not/) here I made a different post essentially just saying START A NEW CONVO OR YOUR COSTS WILL BE ASTRONOMICAL OVER TIME lol",

Since around September 2025, new subscriptions started being charged, and when you changed your plan, you lost the old free Auto plan, which was supposed to stay free for early subscribers for at least a year.\n\nAuto is just a dynamic LLM selector based on Cursor’s internal decision based on docs and stack  notes. I highly doubt it ever picks top tier models like Opus for serious reasoning. In practice, it seems to jump between models like Grok and GPT pretty quickly. \nSam mentioned that the model should be chosen based on prompt difficulty, but that doesn’t mean it will always pick a strong one.\n\nI wouldn’t call Auto a “dumb agent,” but it’s clearly weaker than using Opus or even Sonnet directly. With a well-specified and correct plan, Auto usually works fine for me. The real difference is this: when Auto generates a plan, I almost always need to tweak and adapt it. When I use Opus, 99.9% of the time the plan is already efficient and usable as-is.\n\nAlso, you don’t need a top model to execute the plan. The smart way is to switch agents by phase: use Opus for planning, then use something like Sonnet to actually implement it, even auto should work fine.",

You can just ask the agent to create theme for vscode, or copy the prompt and say make it a subtle green, etc etc. For me it's what i was doing, but then one prompt, led to another, to another, then to a PRD prompt, then 60 cursor agent sessions later I deployed codefrap.com. Got carried away a bit with it. Use a preset or color picker and grab the prompt, also got froggy with attempting to get a Hero Styler and Text Styler, but those are buggy as all get out.  It was really fun having the agents go wild, hardest coaxing was getting tailwind to have include list for unused styles in the build. Really falling in love with building again.",

It got me wondering — will Cursor continue to improve their Tab feature?\n\nAs someone who relies heavily on Tab in my daily work, I genuinely believe it helps me translate my ideas into code quickly and exactly as intended, without any black box concerns.\n\nI’m not against Agent by any means. In fact, within specific and controlled scenarios, I do use Agent to speed up certain tasks. However, I avoid using it for functions involving complex logic or spanning multiple modules, as that introduces uncontrollable risks and makes it hard to ensure accurate understanding of intricate business requirements.\n\nCursor's Tab is fast, smart, and incredibly efficient — but I really hope they keep evolving it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Cursor’s Tab feature?",

Tab and Agent serve different needs - Tab keeps you in control for precise, surgical edits while Agent is better for scaffolding or repetitive tasks where you don't care as much about the exact implementation.\n\nYou're right to avoid Agent for complex logic IMO. The risk isn't just that it might be wrong, it's that you lose the mental model of what's happening in your own code. That's the actual trade-off most people don't talk about.\n\nAs for whether they'll keep improving Tab - hard to say. But given how many experienced devs prefer the control it gives, I'd be surprised if they abandoned it entirely.",

In that screenshot, there is a 4.4m token @ 0.09 and then there is 369k @ 0.09. Same model.\n\nI believe there is a bug in the billing system. There is a 25-30x higher rate than the older requests in this screenshot and even in our dash (work - team (I've finally convinced them to go enterprise soon), home - ultra)\n\nAgain, never cared to bring it up directly to cursor, the track record of doing that is not the greatest.\n\nAlso, letting the agent discover is NOT more efficient.\n\nI had opus review this screen shot too lololol:\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Math Doesn't Add Up:\n\nLooking at cost per token:\n\n* 4.4M tokens → $0.09 = \\~$0.02 per million tokens\n* 369K tokens → $0.09 = \\~$0.24 per million tokens\n\nBut then at the top:\n\n* 2.3M tokens → $1.40 = \\~$0.61 per million tokens ⚠️\n* 1.3M tokens → $0.82 = \\~$0.63 per million tokens ⚠️\n* 1.8M tokens → $1.15 = \\~$0.64 per million tokens ⚠️\n\nThe Problem:\n\nThe recent requests (Jan 30) are being charged at roughly 25-30x higher rate than the older requests (Jan 29-28), despite using similar or even fewer tokens!\n\nThis is definitely a bug. Possible causes:\n\n1. Wrong model pricing applied - Perhaps the recent requests are being charged at GPT-4 rates instead of the actual model used\n2. Input vs output token confusion - Output tokens typically cost 3x more; maybe they're being double-counted\n3. Billing system error - The cost calculation algorithm broke in a recent update\n\nYou should definitely report this to Cursor support immediately with this exact comparison.

          "text": "For the 90% case you describe, Sonnet handles helper functions and basic logic fine. The cost gap is real... Sonnet runs about $3 per MTok input versus Opus at $15 (or $5 for the newer 4.5). That's 3-5x difference depending on which Opus you're hitting.\n\nOne pattern that works: keep Sonnet as default, but notice *when* you hit walls. If you're reprompting the same thing 3+ times or the model keeps missing edge cases, that's your signal to escalate. The wasted tokens from failed attempts often cost more than just running Opus once.\n\nAlso worth checking if Auto is burning tokens on planning steps. Some folks use premium models only for planning, then drop back for implementation. That split can stretch your budget without sacrificing the architectural thinking.",
