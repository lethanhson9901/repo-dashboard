Right now, whatever task I could throw out there, 5.2 will get done appropriately no matter what, with great reasoning and forethought. Auto feels remarkably dumb most of the time in comparison, while being better than some cheaper model options.\n\nI can't imagine needing more than 5.2 , I just currently can't use it all the time due to its high cost. So I agree with other people's thoughts that they really need to be focusing on developing a 'good enough' model that's dirt cheap... I think anything more expensive than what's out there already is kind of pointless. I don't know anyone who's clamoring for AI to 'do more', rather than 'cost less'.",

If 1.5 is priced at Sonnet-level but doesn't meaningfully close the gap with Opus or GPT-5.3 Codex on complex multi-file edits, the value prop gets murky.\n\nI've been using Opus 4.6 for backend/architecture work and Gemini 3 Pro for UI. The model-switching workflow is slightly annoying but the results are significantly better than using one model for everything. Composer 1 filled the \"quick edit, fast iteration\" slot perfectly at its price point.\n\nThe real question is whether 1.5 is good enough to replace the premium models for complex tasks, or just too expensive for the simple ones. That middle ground is hard to justify when you can already switch models per task.",

Similar reason services like chatgpt removed gpt4o as those models were huge and costed a lot to run so were costing the services a lot, in the chatgpt case once deepseek launched MOE it became clear that they could make their own MOE models which would perform similar to 4o but cost 1/10th the price. In this case with composer 1.5 I don't know if the model size changed but they may have to adjust pricing so its actually profitable for them.   \n  \nI understand this change and if Composer 1.5 is still as fast as 1 then it will be worth it. For straight forward changes composer 1 often worked better than even opus 4.5 so as long as composer 1.5 complies it may still have use even with this increased price although this pricing pushes them into the territory of all the other model providers so it REALLY has to be good now.",

Instead of \"make this look good\" (subjective), you're saying \"follow these spacing/color/typography rules\" (objective).\n\nA few patterns that help:\n1. **Examples as constraints** - Show the model 2-3 examples of the aesthetic you want. \"Match this vibe\" works better than describing it.\n\n2. **Negative prompts** - Explicitly call out what NOT to do (\"no gradient buttons, no center-aligned paragraphs, no generic stock photos\").\n\n3. **Component libraries** - Point the AI at Tailwind/Shadcn/etc. and say \"only use components from X\". Reduces the infinite design space.\n\n4. **Iteration budget** - If you're on iteration 5 and it still looks off, the prompt is wrong. Restart with clearer constraints rather than incremental tweaks.\n\nCurious: does your skill enforce specific frameworks (Tailwind, etc.) or is it framework-agnostic design principles?",

So \"editing a modal component\" auto-loads your modal best practices without explicit invocation.\n\n**Measurement gates** - For UI work, automated checks (contrast ratios, touch target sizes, responsive breakpoints) catch issues before human review.\n\nThe real win: turning implicit knowledge into executable constraints that catch problems at creation time, not in review.",

Quite frankly, I use both like a 1-2 punch.\n\n5.3 codex x max finds the edge cases that prevent opus 4.6 doom loops. I'll keep brainstorming and planning until all of 3 of us (opus, codex, and me) reach consensus. Then I'll let opus 4.6 fast execute code. And then I'll have code validate everything.\n\nMy primary issues with 5.3 codex x max high: sometimes hard to comprehend + speed. But Cursor did something magical with the sys prompt and it's fast mode! Thus, why I believe it's probably the best agentic coding experience right now.",

I've learned to set hard budget limits per query and use the right model for the right job.\n\nFor deep debugging where the model needs to see everything: Gemini with its massive context window. For architectural decisions and careful refactoring: Opus with thinking enabled but a budget cap. For quick edits and routine code: Sonnet or Codex, where the cost per query stays reasonable.\n\nThe $120 single query tax is a painful but effective lesson in model selection.

Instead of \"find the bug\" use something like \"check the auth middleware in server/auth.ts for why the session token isn't refreshing after expiry.\" The less the model has to explore on its own, the less it spirals.\n\nAlso, cursor rules help here too. If you have a rules file that says \"keep responses concise, don't explore unrelated code paths,\" it reins in the thinking loop a bit. Not a silver bullet but it adds up.",

It _always_ accrues as you build a solution, because your code _always_ tends to drift from the ideal solution.\n\nBy building and observing use, you discover more about the problem. When you build the next thing to better align with your new understanding of the problem, you are building on a potentially sub-optimal foundation. As you keep doing this, your abstractions become more complex, and new features become harder to implement.\n\nEngineering to resolve tech debt seeks to realign your codebase with your new understanding of the problem. You simplify your abstractions, reduce the complexity of new features, and improve velocity again.\n\nObviously, all of this is easier if you build with and maintain a clean code structure in the first place.\n\nSorry to nitpick, but misuse of the phrase _tech debt_ is a personal bugbear. This might be a bit \"old man shouts at cloud\" but I'm old so ::shrug::. But I don't want this to take away from your comment, which again, I completely agree with!",

Quick scaffolding, boilerplate, simple refactors? Use the cheaper models. Complex architecture decisions, debugging gnarly race conditions, designing APIs? That's where Opus earns its keep.\n\nWe also moved most of our heavy lifting to Claude Code with Max subscriptions rather than Cursor's pay-per-use. The flat rate makes budgeting predictable, and honestly the agent workflow is better for larger tasks anyway. Cursor stays useful for quick inline edits and tab completions.\n\nThe other thing that helped was setting up project-level .cursorrules files that constrain context window usage. Developers were unknowingly burning tokens by having massive codebases indexed when they only needed a few files in scope.\n\nBrought our average back down to around $60-80/dev/month, which is much more reasonable relative to local salaries.",

But, the Cursor chat window is surfacing a 'limit reached' message and forcing me to use Auto.\n\nI reached out to Cursor support (their frontline support is AI chat) and this is the response I got:\n\n\\--  \n  \n\"Hi thanks for reaching out!\n\nYou're correct that the pricing page shows $400/mo for Ultra — that's the included usage amount. The $200 is your monthly subscription price, which includes $400 worth of API usage.\n\nThe reason you're being limited despite showing $81.86 used is due to how Ultra's usage is split into two separate pools:\n\nAuto pool: Usage when Auto is selected as the model  \nAPI pool: Usage when any other model is selected (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.)\n\nYou've been using Claude Opus models (claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, claude-4.6-opus-high-thinking), which draw from your API pool. Your API pool has likely hit 100%, which is why you're being limited — even though your Total usage appears lower because your Auto pool is still available.\"\n\n\\--\n\nThis was my response:\n\n\"This usage breakdown and limiting is incredibly misleading. I can't find what you described anywhere on the pricing page or documentation. If what you are describing is publicly available please provide a direct link to it. \n\nIt's frustrating being an Ultra user at the $200 price point and still having to deal with these hidden \"gotchas\". I've been holding out on switching to Claude Code because I like Cursor and prefer a UI, but you all are making it incredibly difficult to stay. I'm going to be cancelling my subscription at the end of the month and switching to Claude Code.\"\n\n\\--\n\nNow I think I'm being forwarded to a human. \n\nBased off of how the pricing page reads determined how I was using the models. I thought I had $400 worth of Opus. Otherwise I would have been switching models more, instead of burning through the limited Opus availability. \n\nMan, this is frustrating. I love Cursor and think it's a great product be these kind of hidden usage limits are such a bad experience. If this is documented somewhere then maybe it's fair. But if not, it's BS and Cursor has lost another customer to Claude Code.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zqxlrfk6nqig1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ca66af336e3a6cbed85b66c9552a854908dde0d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t83u5fk6nqig1.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b3533b464f3f560370a89585c943b48a8c637c9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2qq1pk6nqig1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=872775c33ebe2e43d085d67776071e887472c831\n\n",

I'd get an idea for an app, open Cursor, type something like \"build me a task management app with a clean UI\" and then spend the next 3 hours fighting the AI because it picked some random stack, invented features I didn't ask for, and made everything look like a Bootstrap template from 2019.\n\nThe problem wasn't the coding agent. It was me. I was giving it garbage specs.\n\nSo over the past couple weeks I built this thing I'm calling Vibe Architect. It's basically a structured brainstorming tool where an AI architect proposes stuff and you just say yes/no/change this. You don't have to come up with anything from scratch.\n\nIt goes through phases:\n\nFirst it figures out your MVP scope (what to build, what to cut)\n\nThen it proposes design system options with actual live previews you can see in the browser\n\nThen tech stack\n\nThen it spits out markdown spec files you can feed directly to Cursor/Claude/whatever\n\nThe thing that I think actually makes this useful is that the AI doesn't ask you dumb questions like \"what font do you want?\" it just proposes 3 options and you pick one. Way faster.\n\nAlso you can stop at any step. Like if you just need help figuring out your MVP scope, cool, you don't have to go through the whole thing.\n\nIt's fully client side, your API keys stay in your browser, and it works with OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude.\n\nAnyway it's free and open source:\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/mohdhd/vibe-architect](https://github.com/mohdhd/vibe-architect)\n\nLive demo: [https://specs-gen.vercel.app](https://specs-gen.vercel.app)\n\nCurious what you guys think.

I believe any reasonable user would be led to believe by the UI that they are doing a temporary increase. However if you increase this limit, it does not reset month to month. This means that Cursor will not warn you at all about spending.  This is a dark pattern intentionally vibe-coded by the Cursor team to deceive customers, and it has cost me $2000 this month. Customer support refuses to refund or meet anywhere in the middle, citing that this is my fault. What do you guys think? I am genuinely curious - you guys have all seen the UI.

Codex 5.3 is usually more deterministic and faster for cleanly defined bugs or simple refactors, even if it lacks some of Opus’s reasoning depth.  \n  \nWhen you hit this kind of wall, try breaking your problem into overly explicit subtasks with tight constraints - it can force Opus to stay focused.
