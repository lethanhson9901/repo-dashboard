          "text": "Hi, we are working very hard on reducing the token consumption for all our users and not increasing token costs. You can compare them with AI provider pricing directly.   \n  \nTo reduce token consumption we relased:   \n\\- Dynamic Context Management: less context required for Agent to do the task, as MCPs/Rules/Logs/etc are fetched without having to attach them all at same time.  \n\\- Subagents: using cheaper models for simpler tasks like code search and returning only info the main agent needs.  \n\\- Efficient tooling: requiring less tokens and less failures which saves tokens as well.  \n\\- And more...\n\nWhat has changed? Models get better which enables you to do more, but they also have higher API pricing which increases cost.\n\nLet me know how you prompt and manage context, I would gladly suggest ways to reduce token consumptions. Less requests does not always result in less cost so it depends on how you use AI.",

              "text": "I think the issue here is that this is not cursor‘s fault, but it is cursor‘s problem. I have burnt through an ultra plan in a few days in comparison to other plans that are direct from providers. I am aware that they’re greatly subsidized, and in the long-term, I think once subsidies fall off cursor is going to be in a very good position.  Between now and that time I think finding a way for unlimited auto to make a comeback would be very interesting. \n\nI think the cursor team is doing a fantastic job, but they’re gonna be pushed out of the market due to pricing and that is the entire plan for Claude code.\n\nMy only comment would be do not underestimate the value of transparency with coming to market with an “unlimited auto” plan that has limitations to make the offering viable monetarily. \n\nThe only way cursor loses the development community is through these subsidized plans from providers. Frankly, I would actually encourage cursor to sign a deal with ChatGPT allow allowing for individuals to bring in their Codex subscriptions for a small fee.  That generates revenue for cursor and helps OpenAI gain market share.\n\nI think it is also interesting that OpenAI is going to be releasing garlic that should be incredibly efficient.  That could change a lot of the math that is currently making cursor hard to justify.\n\nLastly, I’d like to thank the cursor team for everything that you guys do. It’s very easy to criticize the work that is being done, but I believe that the IDE that is being built is phenomenal. It is just becoming unviable based on the economics involved.",

When you ask it a question, it:\n1. Retrieves snippets from your files based on keyword similarity.\n2. Appends them to your prompt.\n3. Predicts the most likely textual answer.\n\nClaude Code uses what Anthropic calls an \"Agentic Workflow.\" Unlike a chat window, it is given a set of Tools (Read, Write, Shell, Search) and a mandate to \"Solve the Goal.\"\n\nInteresting example I found is when there was issue SQL Claude Code directly jump to solution and it’s work but it’s break other record retrieval. Where Cursor asked me to check db record or run sample query to see whether record has problem or not. And issue was with record itself. Both scene using Opus 4.5. Both has pros and cons we need to learn how to them effectively.",

The actual capability of Opus seems to be slightly better in Cursor. But the biggest difference is how I could follow along the thinking path of the model in Cursor compared to CC, and how I could see all of the changes they made as saved but not yet approved clearly and individually reject or modify without losing which parts are modified in Cursor. Also going back and forth by changes in the staging before commit is very important for me. I also tried the cursor extension of CC, same thing.

If some customers use $35 of tokens and the same amount of customers use $25 of tokens, that averages out to $30 and Cursor breaks even. If more customers don’t use the full allocation, Cursor profits. They can set their limit higher because a lot of their customers won’t use the full allocation every month. The more people that don’t use the full allocation, the higher they can set their limits. What you want to do is roll the credits over so everybody gets maximum usage. This breaks the pricing model because now Cursor is selling $35 of service for $30.\n\nIf you don’t like it, then you can go to another provider and pay by token, but when you do this, you will be paying $30 for a $30 limit, not $30 for a $35 limit.",

I’ve been working on drift and now have released 75+ agent skills from my different projects over the last year…\nThe 75 skills cover all of these different categories that may upset some people that im choosing to release these.\nCovering high signal implementations likeCircuit breaker, leader election, graceful shutdown, job-state machine, worker orchestration, web socket management, provenance report, sse-resilence, strip integration and so much more..\n\nIve also been working on Drift\nDrift is a novel look at solving code base intelligence...AI can write us good code but it never fits the conventions of our codebaseDrift has a built in CLI, MCP and soon a VS code extension\nIt scans your codebase and maps out over 15 categories and 150+ patterns.\nIt also weighs and scores these items based off how confident it is and this is queryable through a json file for your agent to retrieve while working to ensure that it always follows how you handle your error logging, api calls, websockets or any of those oother things ai often leads to you having \"drift\"\ncheck it out here fully open sourced: https://github.com/dadbodgeoff/drift\nnpm install -g driftdetect\nCheck the git for supported languages and basic commands to get you started\n",

I have new projects where I have a perfectly clean pattern for doing things and no matter how many times I have my AGENTS.md file optimized, at the end of the day the only way to enforce clean agentic code is by utilizing hooks which can lint, clean, and even spin up sub-agents of their own. Sadly, Claude Code's hook functionality is a year behind the hooks in OpenCode, so it's not as cut and dry to do as I would like. \n\nI have got much better skills and sub-agents now then I did 6 months ago. It's a trial and error process of learning what works and what doesn't. I learned really quickly that those \"libraries\" of Claude Code skills and agents are hot garbage. \n\nThe best skill I ever built for Claude comes with several node scripts and also works on Gemini CLI. It's a one-size-fits-all solution for Playwright screenshots in everything from behind login screens to running Claude in a container. It knows how to take a screenshot perfectly every time in any screen size and with any combination of click and keyboard events - with no fuss and no wasted tokens (Playwright MCP is horrendous at wasting tokens).\n\nAs far as this project goes, I'll have to give it a try. Context management and the stateless nature of these transformer models is the single biggest issue to deal with. It's like you feel yourself repeating yourself every session despite having what you assume is all the info already in AGENTS.md (or equivalent). If tools like this can automatically help with some of these issues then it's at least worth a try. I'll be trying it to see if it's worth the context window cost.",

The reasoning capabilities for refactoring large files are just unmatched right now.\n\nWillow Voice: I use this to dictate my prompts instead of typing them. It handles technical jargon like \"useEffect\" really well and helps me dump context into the chat without breaking flow.\n\nV0 (Vercel): I use this for the initial UI scaffolding. I paste the V0 code into Cursor and let Claude handle the logic.\n\nCleanShot X: Essential for taking screenshots of UI bugs. \"Fix this\" plus a screenshot is infinitely faster than describing a CSS misalignment.\n\nCursor Directory: A great resource I found for grabbing specific .cursorrules files for different tech stacks like Tailwind or Supabase.\n\nPostman: Still the best for testing the API endpoints Claude generates before I try to wire them up to the frontend.\n\nSizzy: A developer browser that lets me see the app on mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes simultaneously while I’m iterating.\n\nKey takeaway: The less I touch the keyboard to explain the code, and the more I use screenshots or tools to provide context, the faster I ship.\n\nHas anyone else found tools that speed up the \"prompting\" phase specifically?",

Turns out when they made the change to API-based pricing in September, I assume it had immediately affected my subscription but no, it only came into play once my subscription renewed.\n\nI raised this as a concern to them once I noticed the discrepancy, and asked if I could cancel my account for a refund (so I could upgrade to the pro/max plan, as while on the yearly I can't change my plan). The response was that as soon as a yearly subscription renews, thats it. You're stuck, no refund, bad luck.\n\nI asked if I could simply \"convert\" the \\~£300 yearly subscription into a monthly subscription for 2 months, but:\n\n>Annual subscriptions can’t be converted into monthly plans or translated into credits for other plans. Once an annual plan renews, it remains active for the full term.\n\n>You can cancel the annual subscription to prevent renewal at the end of the term, but the current annual period can’t be refunded, shortened, or exchanged for monthly plans.\n\n>I know this isn’t the outcome you were hoping for, but this is our final position. If you want help optimizing usage within your current plan or understanding which plan will make sense once the annual term ends, I’m happy to help.\n\nSo I'm now out of pocket for \\~£300 on my current plan, which doesn't cover my usage, and have had to pay an extra \\~£100 for the incurred usage outside of my plan (which is partially my fault for having PAYG switched on, but hadn't had an issue with it previously).\n\nI've now cancelled and switching over to Claude Code. It's a shame, I had really enjoyed using Cursor but this kind of money-grabbing and inflexibility sucks.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nFollowing up on my previous thread about [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1qm0yhq/how_are_you_getting_cursor_to_actually_follow/)—I’m still testing the advice people gave there (thanks everyone for the responses!), but now I have a more focused question about models and costs.\n\nI’m on Pro+ and use Cursor full-time at work. I rely on it every day, and that's not going to change. However, the Auto model doesn't meet my expectations of the quality of output, even after making good prompts—the quality of response of more premium models is far better. But premium models burn through tokens very quickly, so I have to restrict their use a lot.\n\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is how other full-time users balance this in practice so that a $60/month plan is actually enough.\n\nMore concretely:\n\n1. How do you structure your model usage so that a $60/month plan works for full-time work?\n   * Do you reserve expensive models only for certain categories of tasks (e.g., architecture, bigger refactors, complex debugging) and use Auto for everything else?\n   * Do you have any rough strategy like \"expensive model only for the first deep pass, then Auto for iterations,\" or a certain percentage of requests you cap it at?\n2. How do you decide *when* to switch from Auto to a better model during a session?\n   * Do you start with Auto and upgrade only if the answer is clearly not good enough, or do you always start with a premium model for some types of tasks?\n   * Do you rewrite/shorten prompts when using expensive models to save tokens, or keep a separate \"short prompt style\" for them?\n3. For people who feel a noticeable quality gap but still stay within $60: what does your day look like?\n   * Rough number of chats/tasks per day.\n   * How often you end up on a premium model in a typical day or week.\n   * Any practical tricks to avoid burning tokens unnecessarily (e.g., resetting vs continuing a long thread, how long you let a thread run on an expensive model, etc.).\n\nI'm not questioning the value of the better models—I actually prefer working with them. I'm just trying to learn from others how to use them *strategically* so that:\n\n* Auto covers as much as possible, and\n* higher-end models are used in a targeted way that fits into a $60/month budget for a full-time job.\n\nFor context: the $60 plan doesn't work for me because at my company I'm basically working alone on the entire application/module, which requires a lot of coding with AI assistance.\n\nWould really appreciate concrete examples of your model mix, settings, and habits. Thanks!",

Every time you want to run something with Opus, you use Claude Code to hit the 5 hour cooldown and then use Cursor to fill in the in-between with composer or auto. The extension allows you to stay inside Cursor and just have yet another agent window for Claude.\n\nThat way, you will still have Cursor as an IDE with their tab completion, but take most of the expensive prompts with the 20 dollar subscription.",

I'm not a dev at all, but just some dude that works on a pretty complex program for over a year now, and since like 4 or 5 months i use Cursor with the 20$ plan. So in know i'm not your target audience; but maybe my strategy isn't all that dumb. \n\nMy workflow is the following:   \n\\- i use Gemini 3 Pro as a \"Senior Coder\". That means: any idea i have; any blueprinting, creating concepts, etc... ANYTHING that's not certain yet, i do in Gemini 3 Pro. \n\n\\- i use Obsidian do keep a good documentation about ideas i have, bugfix reports, concepts, dataflows (with canvas etc) \n\n\\- i use Cursor as a \"coding bot\" without real agency 95% of the time.. . All i let it do is just type out everythign i designed\n\nWith Cursor, i use basically 2 modes: Planing and Building the plan. EVERYTHING i let Cursor do is planned out in advance, i feed that plan into Gemini and ask for feedback; if there's any i incorporate that and then let Cursor build it. Auto Mode almost exclusively. An exception are the times where very, very complex stuff needs to be done or stuff that's very important.\n\nSo basically:\n\n\\- I design the systems, etc and think of my own solutions; prototype Code (usually only elements of it) and then feed that into Gemini 3 Pro\n\n\\- Gemini Pro does the professional thinking; it checks if my idea is doable, if what i prototyped has glaring flaws or issues, thinks of other or different solutions, looks up libraries we will use, and anything that's relevant here. I let Gemini create documents that specify the technical details that are required to make stuff work like intended.\n\n\\- I go into Obsidian, create a prompt for Cursor. Since my professional background is Law, i usually build my prompts like a contract or other legal document; working in many small steps, defining everything i can as precisely as i can. To me it feels like the most important practice in creating the prompt is NEGATIVE definitions. Telling Cursor what we're NOT doing is really helpful. Looks somehting like this: \n\n1. Introduction / Purpose of the prompt (What are we doing and why?) \n2. Definitions (What are the critical components?)\n3. Detailed information (What do we want and why exactly? What's especially important and what's the though process of why we want that?)\n4.  Context (What other, not directly related information could be important to what we're doing?)\n5. Final thoughts\n\n\\- I feed that into Cursor with the \"Plan\"-mode. \n\n\\- The output of that plan is fed back to Gemini and i ask if that's good or not, what we should change, etc. \n\n\\- I let Cursor build the entire plan in Auto-Mode.\n\n  \nThis wokflow, so far, worked really well. I almost never have to correct stuff; re-prompt or change what it does. It just oneshots the entire process; even if it's VERY complex (well, for my standards - as i said: i have a background in Law; not in programming). \n\nLast thing it did was a FULL GUI migration from CustomTKinter to PyQt6 - for a program i'm working on that currently has around 90 individual .py files with a pretty complex back-end, SQL-DB connections, ML-models, etc. \n\nIf i have to correct stuff, it's smaller details like \"this UI element doesnt look like i want to or is in the wrong position\". But functionally, it's a very, very high hit-rate. \n\nMy time spent is almost all outside of Cursor, creating the prompts, etc. Those i just paste in there and let it loose.",

I also leave the heavy lifting (planning etc.) to more complex and capable models, but in my experience, 'auto' still can't cope with the complexity of my program. For context, it’s a messy monolith built about 10 years ago, so there is A LOT of work to do to refactor the whole thing. Thanks anyway for providing your point of view!",

                  "text": "“Stateful” here doesn’t mean long-lived memory across runs. It means the skill can explicitly track and reason about intermediate progress during a single execution. A command is effectively one-shot: input goes in, a prompt runs, and an output comes back, with no notion of progress or adaptation. A skill, by contrast, can plan work, take actions, inspect results, adjust its approach, and decide whether to continue or stop. While commands may internally “think” in steps, that process is hidden and fixed; skills expose that loop and use it to drive decisions. Because of that, “stateful” is a bit misleading in classic systems terms — a clearer description is “explicit multi-step execution with working memory.”",
