This isn't very documented, many people didn't even know about it and thought that what appeared in the cursor's web panel - tokens, tab and templates used - was all the administrators could see, so they took advantage of it to use it in side projects or even in another company. (I myself admit that I would be on this list if I hadn't promised last year that at this company I wouldn't freak out and follow the rules, everything would be cute.)\n\nHere's a warning to colleagues in the 3 jobs, take care.",

I'll just have to talk to my PR department for a sec... \")  \n\\- if you try to critisize Antrophic or Claude in their Reddit channels the post gets deleted immediately. Only if you prais them, that's ok!  \n\\- while they are rate limiting they also always start campaigns where their employees post gaslighting posts where they explain \"10 techniques to effectively use Claude bla bla\" - like, why would I use Claude if I have to \"manage\" and babysit it's context with all the time I saved. Cue in the followup bot posts accusing everyone \"it isn't degraded, you're doing it wrong! Read Antrophics context management post!\"\n\nTL;DR: Don't go into bed with snakes.",

It’s very token efficient and gives AI the right approach to finding causes, then fixing them. \n- try out different models that may be equal in capability but less costly, learn how those models work and how to prompt best for them. \n- where possible, charge clients for AI usage as it’s a tool for developers.",

You get someone, a really cracked Ghanaian coder to work for you for around, honestly, because they probably won't go down below $250 a month. You're telling me Claude is not smarter than a Ghanaian coder making $250 a month. I'm sorry, that's just fact. Someone with 20 years experience who's been building apps for years but just can't get a green card. Claude is not better than that guy. This is one of the, I don't think it's a bubble. Like, not to mention, the fact that every time they update their code base, all the code you make from, say, six months ago is now really old because you use an old depreciated model that wasn't even smart. Like, you get what I'm saying? It's just such a bad business model when you really, really think about it. Because let's just say you're building a calculator, and you used, you know, Sonnet 1.0, Sonnet 2.2. Now we are on Sonnet 4.5. If someone builds the same app, takes a screenshot of your app, and puts it in Sonnet, they get a TI-84 while your, while your old calculator can barely do calculations. This calculation can't even go on the internet because they use Opos. A Ghanaian coder would just, hell, they can even have a $20, a Ghanaian coder with a $20 Cloud subscription could just even do a better job than using Kesha. Not even Kesha, Kesha, all these AI and their, their talking users on Kesha are a big issue, and honestly, straight up, there's a reason why banks make it hard to get a subscription there. I'm sure eventually it's gonna be one of those Chinese fake um shoes markets like Panda Buy where you can only use PayPal. Because this is crazy. I've made apps and then six months later, I ask the Cloud can one prompt create my whole app. Like, to them that's an advancement. To me, I got robbed because I paid $400 to make this app, and now you can do it one prompt for a $20 membership. That's robbery.",

It orchestrates a swarm of specialized AI agents to identify security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and architectural inconsistencies in your codebase across 25+ programming languages.\n\n**The Problem We're Solving**: One of the biggest challenges we noticed with AI-assisted development—especially for non-developers using tools like Cursor—is that the generated code is often **brittle and non-secure**. Even experienced developers can't think of all the angles when building something new. That's where CodeInsight comes in: by analyzing your code from multiple specialized perspectives (security, performance, architecture, best practices and more), it helps you **deliver better, more robust code in the first iteration** rather than discovering critical issues in production.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vgnv76ehwqgg1.png?width=3842&format=png&auto=webp&s=86ffdc8df760c85ccafdc8251fdf16e9b4455c8e\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/codeinsight-ai-powered-multi-agent-code-analysis-platform-v0-4wlvrz6uvqgg1.png?width=3842&format=png&auto=webp&s=daf8151686b4273e3b2f70cdce36639645f35c4e)\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/sanaullah/CodeInsight](https://github.com/sanaullah/CodeInsight)",

Turns out the real limit (at least for me) was around **\\~520M tokens total**, which Cursor values at about **$195 worth of usage**. Most of it came from **Auto mode (\\~414M tokens)**, then a ton from **GPT-5.2 Codex (\\~82M)**, some **Claude Opus**, GPT-5.2, Sonnet, Grok, etc. Once I hit that, **Auto and Pro just stopped working completely**.\n\nPosting this because Cursor really needs a usage meter the plan is crazy generous, but not knowing when you’re about to run out is super confusing. Hope this helps someone else.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vz5y4ptwpfgg1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea7aeb1066e518d59de108403506778cd7cb5c29\n\n\n\n[Cursor $20 pro max token limit](https://preview.redd.it/pe4eh9rvpfgg1.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=4327a4645946d2fb4aa23370b7f158609207c8f6)\n\n",

Out of their generosity you get to use sometimes more. \n\nIn summary in real workflows $20 dollars is too low as you dont control exactly how much token will be used in each request. \n\nIs not cursor fault. However is important to mention that it would be better for them to offer their OWN (composer -1 or mini models) model for free for ONLY PAID users so that people feel they are getting value. Since the competition is providing unlimited agentic in the mini models.",

      "text": "I see a lot of posts here claiming the models are getting \"stupider\" or \"lazy\" after updates. I used to have the same issue until I changed my workflow.\n\nI call it the **Columbo Method**. Yes, the 1970s TV show detective.\n\nThe philosophy is simple: Treat your codebase like a crime scene where you don't know what happened. You play the role of the confused detective. You get the agent to \"lock in on their story\" first, and only when you are absolutely sure they know the truth do you \"set the trap\" (hit Apply).\n\nHere is the exact workflow I use to save tokens, stop hallucinations, and fix complex bugs.\n\n### 1. The Investigation (Ask Mode)\n\nNever start by telling the agent to fix something. Start by acting like a confused co-worker. I always use `Ask` mode first.\n\n**The Prompt:** *\"I am logged into the app and when I click this button, it does that. It should do this. Can you review exactly how this works and look for any potential issues?\"*\n\nThis forces **retrieval**. It scans the files to answer your question, effectively loading the correct context into its window before it tries to solve anything.\n\n### 2. \"Just One More Thing...\" (Rhetorical Questions)\n\nIf the agent gives you a generic answer, don't build yet. Channel your inner Columbo and ask rhetorical questions about edge cases. You are verifying that it actually understands the logic and isn't just guessing.\n\n**The Prompt:** *\"In our current implementation, if a user does X, what happens? What happens if they also do Y? And wait, what if the network fails here?\"*\n\nKeep doing this until the explanation matches reality 100%. If it hallucinates here, it costs you nothing. If it hallucinates while coding, it costs you an hour of debugging.\n\n### 3. The Confession (Plan Mode)\n\nOnce the agent has \"locked in its story,\" switch to `Composer (Plan)` mode.\n\n**The Prompt:** *\"Create a concrete implementation plan for this fix.\"*\n\nThis generates a markdown file (like a `plan.md`). This is crucial because LLMs have recency bias. If the chat gets long, the agent might forget the start. The Plan file is a permanent anchor you can reference later. Review this manually. **If the plan is wrong, the code will be wrong.**\n\n### 4. The Execution\n\nOnly now—after the investigation, the interrogation, and the written confession—do I actually let it write code.\n\n1. Reference the Plan file.\n2. Select your smartest model (e.g., Opus 4.5 thinking).\n3. Click Build.\n\nStop trying to vibe code and start acting like a detective. It changes everything.",

      "text": "We’ve been using AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code) in production for a while now. Mid-sized team. Large codebase. Nothing exotic. But over time, our token usage kept creeping up, especially during handoffs. New dev picks up a task, asks a few “where is X implemented?” types simple questions, and suddenly the agent is pulling half the repo into context.\n\nAt first we thought this was just the cost of using AI on a big codebase. Turned out the real issue was *how context was rebuilt*.\n\nEvery query was effectively a cold start. Even if someone asked the same architectural question an hour later, the agent would:\n\n* run semantic search again\n* load the same files again\n* burn the same tokens again\n\nWe tried being disciplined with manual file tagging inside Cursor. It helped a bit, but we were still loading entire files when only small parts mattered. Cache hit rate on understanding was basically zero.\n\nThen we came across the idea of persistent architectural memory and ended up testing it in ByteRover. The mental model was simple; instead of caching answers, you cache understanding.\n\n# How it works in practice\n\nYou curate architectural knowledge once:\n\n* entry points\n* control flow\n* where core logic lives\n* how major subsystems connect\n\nThis is short, human-written context. Not auto-generated docs. Not full files. That knowledge is stored and shared across the team. When a query comes in, the agent retrieves this memory first and only inspects code if it actually needs implementation detail.\n\nSo instead of loading 10k plus tokens of source code to answer: “Where is server component rendering implemented?”\n\nThe agent gets a few hundred tokens describing the structure and entry points, then drills down selectively.\n\n# Real example from our tests\n\nWe ran the same four queries on the same large repo:\n\n* architecture exploration\n* feature addition\n* system debugging\n* build config changes\n\nManual file tagging baseline:\n\n* \\~12.5k tokens per query on average\n\nWith memory-based context:\n\n* \\~2.1k tokens per query on average\n\nThat’s about an **83% token reduction** and roughly **56% cost savings** once output tokens are factored in.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t6iyrdf3bbgg1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=420bf042cc407b7c22403d252f6920d9728dc176\n\nSystem debugging benefited the most. Those questions usually span multiple files and relationships. File-based workflows load everything upfront. Memory-based workflows retrieve structure first, then inspect only what matters.\n\n# The part that surprised me\n\nLatency became predictable. File-based context had wild variance depending on how many search passes ran. Memory-based queries were steady. Fewer spikes. Fewer “why is this taking 30 seconds” moments.\n\nAnd answers were more consistent across developers because everyone was querying the same shared understanding, not slightly different file selections.\n\n# What we didn’t have to do\n\n* No changes to application code\n* No prompt gymnastics\n* No training custom models\n\nWe just added a memory layer and pointed our agents at it.\n\nIf you want the full breakdown with numbers, charts, and the exact methodology, we wrote it up [here](https://www.byterover.dev/blog/reducing-token-usage-by-83-benchmarking-cursor-s-file-context-vs.-byterover-s-memory-layer).\n\n# When is this worth it\n\nThis only pays off if:\n\n* the codebase is large\n* multiple devs rotate across the same areas\n* AI is used daily for navigation and debugging\n\nFor small repos or solo work, file tagging is fine. But once AI becomes part of how teams understand systems, rebuilding context from scratch every time is just wasted spend.\n\nWe didn’t optimize prompts. We optimized how understanding persists. And that’s where the savings came from.",

If you limit yourself to vibe coding and just QA testing what the agent does, you will always hit a wall and your apps will become unmanageable.\n\nUse the agents to write the boring boilerplate code, then design how you want your architecture to be and do the skeleton yourself, then have the agent follow your lead then teach you what it did and why.",

However, the way people code is changing, and the practice of programming is moving away from the way you are thinking about it. You shouldn't feel discouraged.  \n  \nPeople used to write code in lower level languages. Higher level languages were developed to make programming easier and more powerful. With AI, we're tasked with working at an even higher level. How we do that is still being worked out. New tools are being developed. Languages are still the same, but they were actually designed for a completely different way of working, and it would not be surprising to see new languages emerge that are better suited to a different programming paradigm.  \n  \nWhat you need to know as a programmer going forward is also changing, as well as what has value. The value is moving from “can you write this function?” to “can you architect this system, debug this edge case, or design this experience?” The learning curve has moved.  \n  \nI would suggest changing your focus, and shift to learning the skills that will help you be a better programmer in this new paradigm. Learn to review code. Learn about design and architecture. Learn how to break down a project, and direct its development. Learn how to communicate intent.  And pay close attention to new developments. Things are changing fast.  \n  \nYou joined at a moment of transformation. That’s not the worst time. It's exciting and uncertain. But the job won't be to write code in lower level languages than you need to, just like we don't typically write code in assembly.",

I had to finetune the mcp files a bit, but essentially each task is split into dozen of subtasks of course, detailed explanation (all done by task-master) and there are always include test writing, running tests until everything works, updating documentation, commiting. Once the agent stops i just review, then open a new chat and start again.  \nContext grows sometimes to 50-70% of this little circle - but as i rarely have to prompt again once the agent stops, i just open a new chat to clean the context.\n\nAnd so far its way superiour than i did without it - i nearly dont have to do those bug hunting sessions anymore where you realize it was going off the rails inbetween and you didnt noticed - or it just implemented something twice, slightly different, because it didnt realized we did this already.",

Typically my plan phases / docs are implemented in 2-4mins without any MCP servers, aiming to keep context under 50% utilisation.  \n\n\nReally good planning is definitely the way, and if you give the AI a detailed enough plan, you don't need expensive LLMs to successfully implement it. The question is now if you have the patience to write & review this sort of plan, and not fall back on using AI to create a low quality, flawed version.",

Its nearly the only mcp tool i use.  \nIf the tasks and subtasks are done correctly (nothing to guess at, small broken down steps together with frequent automated tests) then its really just going.  \nHalf a year ago - yeah, i was filling the context window pretty fast. But now, Cursor itself is pretty smart when prompted correctly (wich the tools are doing) to really just grab the pieces of code it needs.  \nAs i have an entry point each time (a full doc about where things live, how its structured, how functions connect etc.) just for the ai - it reads this at the start of each task and then knows exactly where to look. This saves a ton of tokens it seems.\n\nMy gut feeling is - if the context gets too high while doing a subtask - the subtask was too complex and not broken down enough.\n\nI am not saying this is the perfect aproach - but most of the issues i see people are complaining about or running into are non-existent for me. So my guess is that this is part of the puzzle.  \nIf you want to have a look at how my docs (for ai use) look, or i guess general rules etc. --> the project i am currently working at the side is here: [https://github.com/abhuva/email-agent](https://github.com/abhuva/email-agent)  \nthere is a [readme-ai.md](http://readme-ai.md) that is basically the entry point for each new chat (its always served as context).

It’s \"Infrastructure as Code\" but for AI behavior.\n\nThat sounds like a great flow, but it feels like you're paying a 'Planning Tax' on every new chat. The beauty of the .mdc is that it’s passive. You code the 'Laws of the Land' once, and then you don't need a 'Task-Master' to remind the AI how to behave—the environment itself enforces it. Aren't you basically just manually doing what the MDC was designed to automate?",

Don’t get me wrong, I hate paying for cursor too.\n\nThe closest I’d say out of all of them that have this context awareness is windsurf. You can tell it does have some deeper searching abilities over just grep. However cursor really perfected this total awareness and that’s why they have a monopoly and can charge as much as they do.

The most frustrating part is that even when I get back to the layout I like, I can't tell you how I did it. Every other day, the settings for the layout seems to change location.

We don't mutate tasks behind the scenes.\n\nIf you're comparing over time (model drift detection), you'd re-run the exact same saved task against updated model versions.\n\nAbout eval loops, the multi-step chaining (pipeline variables) lets you test agent decision points if you structure the task that way.\n\nAppreciate the blog link!

Today I'm using my $200 plan and I've already passed $60 of usage so I'm trying to just work in Auto mode to save money, but since I did that it still seems to be rising at about the same pace.\n\nIs everyone experiencing the same thing? I know my project has gotten rather large but I'm trying to make my queries very focused on one specific issue at a time but each query still seems to cost a decent amount of money.\n\nIs the issue that I simply need to create a new convo because the one I'm in is simply just bleeding cash or is this just the new state of Cursor as a whole?\n\n\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*: Okay I spoke with support and they clarified the issue. Ever since they've allowed indexing a convo, I've kind of just been running the same convo for like a month straight. THIS is absolutely killing my bill. The cached convo tokens are like 5x the usage of every other thing I'm doing.\n\nBasically by maintaining the same convo, I'm causing myself to have exponentially higher costs with every message I send no matter how small it is.\n\nI knew this was how it used to work but I assumed once the indexing process started this was no longer an issue but actually it's a bigger issue than ever because it causes people like my to let convos go on for WAY too long.\n\nThey also let me know that the $200 plan allows for $400 of usage which also made me feel better.\n\nNot to be a huge ass kisser but I was very happy with their very fast response and full explanation of my specific issue so thank you Cursor team!\n\n  \n\\*\\*Edit\\*\\*: [PSA: Indexing Your Conversational Context DOES NOT Index Your Cost! : r/cursor](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1qv5903/psa_indexing_your_conversational_context_does_not/) here I made a different post essentially just saying START A NEW CONVO OR YOUR COSTS WILL BE ASTRONOMICAL OVER TIME lol",

Only paying 20$ a month and 2 weeks ago, like 5 days before my monthly limit refreshed I reached limits (well, not really limits, cause they say they give you a lot of free usage \"on them\") but it was the first time I was actually cut out of using cursor in a whole year of using it. \n\n\n   Then, after my monthly quota was refreshed, I reached limits (the 20$ + free usage \"on them\") in about 5 days!!! That's crazy... it most definitely changed.\nI never used opus 4.5 BTW cause i know that is super expensive, but I did switched from auto to sonnet 4.5 cause auto was reeeeally stupid now (which is also something that I noticed within this year of usage) auto was not that dumb before( I guess it was using sonnet 4.5?)\n\n\nAnyways, I'm kinda cooked now cause I'm a new dev with only 1 year of experience and I was developing so much with cursor assistance, but since the AI cover the syntax, I could focus on studying and learning about architecture/business logic... there's no way I could develop so much so fast without it to cover the syntax",

Got carried away a bit with it. Use a preset or color picker and grab the prompt, also got froggy with attempting to get a Hero Styler and Text Styler, but those are buggy as all get out.  It was really fun having the agents go wild, hardest coaxing was getting tailwind to have include list for unused styles in the build. Really falling in love with building again.",

It got me wondering — will Cursor continue to improve their Tab feature?\n\nAs someone who relies heavily on Tab in my daily work, I genuinely believe it helps me translate my ideas into code quickly and exactly as intended, without any black box concerns.\n\nI’m not against Agent by any means. In fact, within specific and controlled scenarios, I do use Agent to speed up certain tasks. However, I avoid using it for functions involving complex logic or spanning multiple modules, as that introduces uncontrollable risks and makes it hard to ensure accurate understanding of intricate business requirements.\n\nCursor's Tab is fast, smart, and incredibly efficient — but I really hope they keep evolving it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Cursor’s Tab feature?",

Tab and Agent serve different needs - Tab keeps you in control for precise, surgical edits while Agent is better for scaffolding or repetitive tasks where you don't care as much about the exact implementation.\n\nYou're right to avoid Agent for complex logic IMO. The risk isn't just that it might be wrong, it's that you lose the mental model of what's happening in your own code. That's the actual trade-off most people don't talk about.\n\nAs for whether they'll keep improving Tab - hard to say. But given how many experienced devs prefer the control it gives, I'd be surprised if they abandoned it entirely.",

There is a 25-30x higher rate than the older requests in this screenshot and even in our dash (work - team (I've finally convinced them to go enterprise soon), home - ultra)\n\nAgain, never cared to bring it up directly to cursor, the track record of doing that is not the greatest.\n\nAlso, letting the agent discover is NOT more efficient.\n\nI had opus review this screen shot too lololol:\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Math Doesn't Add Up:\n\nLooking at cost per token:\n\n* 4.4M tokens → $0.09 = \\~$0.02 per million tokens\n* 369K tokens → $0.09 = \\~$0.24 per million tokens\n\nBut then at the top:\n\n* 2.3M tokens → $1.40 = \\~$0.61 per million tokens ⚠️\n* 1.3M tokens → $0.82 = \\~$0.63 per million tokens ⚠️\n* 1.8M tokens → $1.15 = \\~$0.64 per million tokens ⚠️\n\nThe Problem:\n\nThe recent requests (Jan 30) are being charged at roughly 25-30x higher rate than the older requests (Jan 29-28), despite using similar or even fewer tokens!\n\nThis is definitely a bug. Possible causes:\n\n1. Wrong model pricing applied - Perhaps the recent requests are being charged at GPT-4 rates instead of the actual model used\n2. Input vs output token confusion - Output tokens typically cost 3x more; maybe they're being double-counted\n3. Billing system error - The cost calculation algorithm broke in a recent update\n\nYou should definitely report this to Cursor support immediately with this exact comparison.

      "text": "So I’ve been testing different models for code generation without burning tokens too fast, and Auto mode just eats tokens probably because it keeps picking the expensive ones like Opus 4.5.\n\nDoes anyone have a go-to model they use every day that’s good at coding but doesn’t cost hundreds of dollars a month?\n\nNot gonna lie, I’m not doing super complex stuff like 90% of the time it’s just some small helper functions or basic logic that I want the AI to spit out so I can save a few minutes. With Grok Code (when it was free), it felt like there was a noticeable difference between it and Opus 4.5 even on simple stuff. Now I’m just trying to find something that hits that same sweet spot, solid code quality without the insane cost.",

But i have seen that the context gets filled quicker so it forces me to summarize more often. \n\nI found the other models performing better for very rare and specific tasks, yet they also are quite expensive. For one refactor that i am doing with auto at the moment, i tried to use the linear agent, and it costed like 1.5 USD as it was using max mode.

          "text": "For the 90% case you describe, Sonnet handles helper functions and basic logic fine. The cost gap is real... Sonnet runs about $3 per MTok input versus Opus at $15 (or $5 for the newer 4.5). That's 3-5x difference depending on which Opus you're hitting.\n\nOne pattern that works: keep Sonnet as default, but notice *when* you hit walls. If you're reprompting the same thing 3+ times or the model keeps missing edge cases, that's your signal to escalate. The wasted tokens from failed attempts often cost more than just running Opus once.\n\nAlso worth checking if Auto is burning tokens on planning steps. Some folks use premium models only for planning, then drop back for implementation. That split can stretch your budget without sacrificing the architectural thinking.",

If you're consistently brushing up against token limits or struggling to finish/deliver a project due to these model quirks, a service like Appstuck might be handy - it's built to help users of tools like Lovable, Replit, and FlutterFlow when they hit snags or need expert help to move things forward.",
