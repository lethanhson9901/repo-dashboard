The text indicates two things..\n\nAI decided the original code was too shit to just do a simple spelling mistake update, and took it upon itself to re-write large portions of the code. In early times, it is true, my code was shit and did need a rewrite, except AI tools notoriously fucked things up early on during a re-write.\n\nThese days LLMs are more willing to overlook shit code and just do what you ask it. It also is more able to write a couple hundred lines without shitting the bed at every opportunity.\n\nNonetheless, memes like this exist to remind us of the old times, and this meme sums it up perfectly my reaction when a simple change goes off the rails.",

If 1.5 is priced at Sonnet-level but doesn't meaningfully close the gap with Opus or GPT-5.3 Codex on complex multi-file edits, the value prop gets murky.\n\nI've been using Opus 4.6 for backend/architecture work and Gemini 3 Pro for UI. The model-switching workflow is slightly annoying but the results are significantly better than using one model for everything. Composer 1 filled the \"quick edit, fast iteration\" slot perfectly at its price point.\n\nThe real question is whether 1.5 is good enough to replace the premium models for complex tasks, or just too expensive for the simple ones. That middle ground is hard to justify when you can already switch models per task.",

Similar reason services like chatgpt removed gpt4o as those models were huge and costed a lot to run so were costing the services a lot, in the chatgpt case once deepseek launched MOE it became clear that they could make their own MOE models which would perform similar to 4o but cost 1/10th the price. In this case with composer 1.5 I don't know if the model size changed but they may have to adjust pricing so its actually profitable for them.   \n  \nI understand this change and if Composer 1.5 is still as fast as 1 then it will be worth it. For straight forward changes composer 1 often worked better than even opus 4.5 so as long as composer 1.5 complies it may still have use even with this increased price although this pricing pushes them into the territory of all the other model providers so it REALLY has to be good now.",

Instead of \"make this look good\" (subjective), you're saying \"follow these spacing/color/typography rules\" (objective).\n\nA few patterns that help:\n1. **Examples as constraints** - Show the model 2-3 examples of the aesthetic you want. \"Match this vibe\" works better than describing it.\n\n2. **Negative prompts** - Explicitly call out what NOT to do (\"no gradient buttons, no center-aligned paragraphs, no generic stock photos\").\n\n3. **Component libraries** - Point the AI at Tailwind/Shadcn/etc. and say \"only use components from X\". Reduces the infinite design space.\n\n4. **Iteration budget** - If you're on iteration 5 and it still looks off, the prompt is wrong. Restart with clearer constraints rather than incremental tweaks.\n\nCurious: does your skill enforce specific frameworks (Tailwind, etc.) or is it framework-agnostic design principles?",

So \"editing a modal component\" auto-loads your modal best practices without explicit invocation.\n\n**Measurement gates** - For UI work, automated checks (contrast ratios, touch target sizes, responsive breakpoints) catch issues before human review.\n\nThe real win: turning implicit knowledge into executable constraints that catch problems at creation time, not in review.",

I think cursor quickly figured out that people just want to use the “best” tool, nobody wants to spend the time sorting through the riff raff to figure out which works best - especially for non-devs who wouldn’t know where to start in the first place. They sold themselves as a premium one stop/not tied a specific foundation model provider shop that’s purely incentivized to give you the best tool for your use case . \n\nEnd of day it’s interesting bc I honestly don’t think this is one of those cases where by an incumbent was actually poised to dominate this space like they talk about OpenAI and Microsoft/Google. The positioning of being the decision layer above the models is what was going to determine the winner here regardless and cursor just so happened to be the first to market and almost stumble into the dominant product positioning",

It's if the underlying models get good enough that a simple API call replaces the need for an orchestration layer entirely. Claude Code running in a terminal is already close to that for some workflows.\n\nBut here's what keeps Cursor relevant: most developers don't want to configure agents, manage context windows, or write system prompts. They want to open a project, tab-complete intelligently, and have inline edits that work. That's a product problem, not a model problem.\n\nThe companies that lose in AI tooling are the ones building thin wrappers. Cursor has enough proprietary context management, codebase indexing, and UX polish that switching costs are real.

I'll keep brainstorming and planning until all of 3 of us (opus, codex, and me) reach consensus. Then I'll let opus 4.6 fast execute code. And then I'll have code validate everything.\n\nMy primary issues with 5.3 codex x max high: sometimes hard to comprehend + speed. But Cursor did something magical with the sys prompt and it's fast mode! Thus, why I believe it's probably the best agentic coding experience right now.",

Cursors sub isnt going too far with sonnet though lately so...\n\nEnded up getting hit with extra usage on both claude and cursor last month,  just needed to get stuff done and fast, blew through weekly limits on claude early, whatever January was busy for me. Think it was 60 to 80 dollars extra across both.\n\nAnyway, decided last week to upgrade claude to the $100 max plan this month, well fml, for my purposes its basically unlimited opus on tap. I'm still in the first week but I actually can't push it far enough to use up the weekly limit,  I'm only at 30% weekly limit and my 'goal' was to be at 60% to make sure I get the value of it and leave nothing in the table. I'm blown away, I've been working flat out with it all week. I have github actions running pr reviews constantly, 2 or 3 agents on the go working to create pr's.\n\nBeen thinking today how I'm going to step it up another level but yeah... I dont know what my point is exactly but yeah extra usage on cursor is starting to look like terrible value, I would have had single prompts cost me a few dollars to try and get out of a hole when a $100 monthly plan straight from claude has 5 hourly and WEEKLY limits that I can't get even close to hitting and I'm pushing as hard as I can.\n\nLong may it last, don't know if I can financially justify my new $100 a month crack habit but we will see. I see people talking about having two $20 a month plans, perhaps that is the sweet spot but I always felt using opus on the $20 plan ate the weekly limit. This just feels bottomless.",

This is odd because it never was an issue **until** you guys announced MORE usage. I´ll say, it´s definitely not a me thing. \n\nReally weird time where *nothing* is actually being quantified, and pricing changes without notice (both monthly, and mid-cycle switching to charging for Auto). what am I meant to do with these proclamations of increased usage, and lower pricing when it´s yet to be corroborated in practice?\n\n Still top tier, I just am always discouraged, and now every single model costs. I tried using Kimi and nearly shat myself because it hit my credits with the same rigor as any other frontier model. \n\nNot sure if this has anything to do with the shared pool of Composer 1.5 and Auto (please stop this) but ever since this announcement I´ve been charged out the wazoo.\n\n",

I've learned to set hard budget limits per query and use the right model for the right job.\n\nFor deep debugging where the model needs to see everything: Gemini with its massive context window. For architectural decisions and careful refactoring: Opus with thinking enabled but a budget cap. For quick edits and routine code: Sonnet or Codex, where the cost per query stays reasonable.\n\nThe $120 single query tax is a painful but effective lesson in model selection.

The agent calls a tool, gets a response, calls it again, and just keeps going until it burns through your entire budget. It's a known failure mode that really should have a built-in circuit breaker.\n\nTwo things I do now to protect against this:\n\n1. Set the on-demand spend limit to something small, like $10-20 increments. Yes it means you occasionally hit the cap mid-session, but that's infinitely better than waking up to a triple-digit charge.\n\n2. Watch the token counter during agent runs. If you see it climbing fast with the agent repeatedly calling the same tool, kill the session immediately. Don't wait for it to \"figure it out.\"\n\nThe fact that their support blamed your context management is frustrating. A single message generating 241M tokens is clearly not a user error. That's a runaway loop on their infrastructure and they should have detection for that. I'd push back hard on the refund.",

When Opus 4.5 dropped, our per-developer costs went from maybe $40/month to $150+ almost overnight because the devs naturally gravitated to the most capable model for everything, even tasks that didn't need it.\n\nThe fix was surprisingly simple: we created a model selection guide for the team. Quick scaffolding, boilerplate, simple refactors? Use the cheaper models. Complex architecture decisions, debugging gnarly race conditions, designing APIs? That's where Opus earns its keep.\n\nWe also moved most of our heavy lifting to Claude Code with Max subscriptions rather than Cursor's pay-per-use. The flat rate makes budgeting predictable, and honestly the agent workflow is better for larger tasks anyway. Cursor stays useful for quick inline edits and tab completions.\n\nThe other thing that helped was setting up project-level .cursorrules files that constrain context window usage. Developers were unknowingly burning tokens by having massive codebases indexed when they only needed a few files in scope.\n\nBrought our average back down to around $60-80/dev/month, which is much more reasonable relative to local salaries.",

But, the Cursor chat window is surfacing a 'limit reached' message and forcing me to use Auto.\n\nI reached out to Cursor support (their frontline support is AI chat) and this is the response I got:\n\n\\--  \n  \n\"Hi thanks for reaching out!\n\nYou're correct that the pricing page shows $400/mo for Ultra — that's the included usage amount. The $200 is your monthly subscription price, which includes $400 worth of API usage.\n\nThe reason you're being limited despite showing $81.86 used is due to how Ultra's usage is split into two separate pools:\n\nAuto pool: Usage when Auto is selected as the model  \nAPI pool: Usage when any other model is selected (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.)\n\nYou've been using Claude Opus models (claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, claude-4.6-opus-high-thinking), which draw from your API pool. Your API pool has likely hit 100%, which is why you're being limited — even though your Total usage appears lower because your Auto pool is still available.\"\n\n\\--\n\nThis was my response:\n\n\"This usage breakdown and limiting is incredibly misleading. I can't find what you described anywhere on the pricing page or documentation. If what you are describing is publicly available please provide a direct link to it. \n\nIt's frustrating being an Ultra user at the $200 price point and still having to deal with these hidden \"gotchas\". I've been holding out on switching to Claude Code because I like Cursor and prefer a UI, but you all are making it incredibly difficult to stay. I'm going to be cancelling my subscription at the end of the month and switching to Claude Code.\"\n\n\\--\n\nNow I think I'm being forwarded to a human. \n\nBased off of how the pricing page reads determined how I was using the models. I thought I had $400 worth of Opus. Otherwise I would have been switching models more, instead of burning through the limited Opus availability. \n\nMan, this is frustrating. I love Cursor and think it's a great product be these kind of hidden usage limits are such a bad experience. If this is documented somewhere then maybe it's fair. But if not, it's BS and Cursor has lost another customer to Claude Code.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zqxlrfk6nqig1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ca66af336e3a6cbed85b66c9552a854908dde0d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t83u5fk6nqig1.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b3533b464f3f560370a89585c943b48a8c637c9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2qq1pk6nqig1.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=872775c33ebe2e43d085d67776071e887472c831\n\n",

I thought we were all developers / engineers, people that like to read documentation.\n\nThe reason to use Cursor is for exposure to multiple frontier models and decent tab completions.\n\nStart using GPT 5.3 Codex in cursor or other good models in the market and you will notice you can get greater usage. GPT 5.3 Codex (High reasoning level) is currently  on-par to Opus for coding.\n\nDont forget about gemini 3 flash, good for quick stuff and the price is per million token is amazing.",

Customer support refuses to refund or meet anywhere in the middle, citing that this is my fault. What do you guys think? I am genuinely curious - you guys have all seen the UI.

I'd get an idea for an app, open Cursor, type something like \"build me a task management app with a clean UI\" and then spend the next 3 hours fighting the AI because it picked some random stack, invented features I didn't ask for, and made everything look like a Bootstrap template from 2019.\n\nThe problem wasn't the coding agent. It was me. I was giving it garbage specs.\n\nSo over the past couple weeks I built this thing I'm calling Vibe Architect. It's basically a structured brainstorming tool where an AI architect proposes stuff and you just say yes/no/change this. You don't have to come up with anything from scratch.\n\nIt goes through phases:\n\nFirst it figures out your MVP scope (what to build, what to cut)\n\nThen it proposes design system options with actual live previews you can see in the browser\n\nThen tech stack\n\nThen it spits out markdown spec files you can feed directly to Cursor/Claude/whatever\n\nThe thing that I think actually makes this useful is that the AI doesn't ask you dumb questions like \"what font do you want?\" it just proposes 3 options and you pick one. Way faster.\n\nAlso you can stop at any step. Like if you just need help figuring out your MVP scope, cool, you don't have to go through the whole thing.\n\nIt's fully client side, your API keys stay in your browser, and it works with OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude.\n\nAnyway it's free and open source:\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/mohdhd/vibe-architect](https://github.com/mohdhd/vibe-architect)\n\nLive demo: [https://specs-gen.vercel.app](https://specs-gen.vercel.app)\n\nCurious what you guys think.

      "text": "I wrote a pretty rough Express.js file (hardcoded creds, copy-pasted auth checks, everything jammed in one file) and gave all 5 Cursor Pro models the same prompt: \"refactor this into a clean structure.\"\n\nThey all handled the obvious stuff fine -- env vars, auth middleware, splitting routes, keeping PostgreSQL. But the differences show up in what each one decided to add on its own.\n\n**Opus** noticed my JWT tokens had no expiry, added `expiresIn: '24h'`, threw in a `.gitignore`, and quietly changed a 400 status code to 401 for invalid tokens. I didn't ask for any of that.\n\n**Sonnet** caught the JWT expiry too but made it configurable through an env var. Also added a `/health` endpoint, a README, and `express.urlencoded()`. More of an ops angle.\n\n**GPT** went way further than I expected. Built a custom `HttpError` class, an `asyncHandler` wrapper for async routes, and split `app.js` from `server.js` for testability. The asyncHandler is actually useful since Express doesn't catch async errors on its own.\n\n**Gemini** did exactly what I asked and nothing more. The output was clean but there were no surprises. Also the slowest at 4+ minutes.\n\n**Auto** produced output that overlapped with multiple models. Some patterns matched Opus (JWT expiry, 401 fix), others looked more like GPT (app/server split). I can't determine which model it actually routed to.\n\n**Timing:**\n- Sonnet: ~60s\n- GPT: ~1m 21s\n- Opus: ~2m\n- Gemini: ~4m 21s\n\nI've been defaulting to Sonnet for most things since this. It's fast and it adds stuff I'd actually want. Opus when I care about security. GPT if I want it to go overboard on architecture.\n\nAnyway, worth actually looking at the diffs instead of just accepting the first output. Some of the \"extras\" were things I should've asked for in the first place.\n\n(all tested in Cursor CLI agent mode, Pro plan)\n\n**Edit:** Fixed the Auto mode section. I originally said it picked Opus but looking at the output patterns more carefully, they overlap with multiple models. I was inferring from similarities and stated it too confidently.",

      "text": "Man, for the first 2-3 files of a project, Cursor and Claude feel like absolute magic. But I recently hit a massive wall on a more complex app that almost made me quit the whole thing.\n\nI ask the AI to add a feature, it fixes one thing but breaks three others. I tell it to fix the bugs, and it starts gaslighting me, saying the code is correct when it clearly isn't. This usually happens because the context window gets messy and the AI loses the context.\n\nI’ve spent the last month refining a workflow that actually works for multi-file, complex systems. It’s a 3-step loop that moves the thinking out of the IDE:\n\n  \nInstead of just direct prompts, I started using traycer as an architect layer first. I dump my ideas into it just to get a solid technical blueprint and spec.\n\nOnce I have that verified spec, then I hand it over to Claude or Cursor. Because the AI has a strict map to follow now, it stops guessing. Hallucinations drop to basically zero because I’m not asking it to design and build simultaneously just execute.\n\nAfter it spits out the code, I run it back through Traycer just to cross-check it against the original plan. It catches those sneaky logic drifts.\n\nJust sharing what finally worked for me. Curious to hear how you guys are managing context drift in larger AI-assisted projects?",

When you let the AI both architect and implement in the same session, it optimizes for the path it already chose instead of the best path.\n\nWhat works for us: define the data model, API contracts, and component boundaries in a plain markdown doc before touching the IDE. The AI becomes dramatically more reliable when it has constraints to work within rather than open-ended freedom.\n\nThe other thing that kills the gaslighting loop is keeping files small. Once a single file crosses ~300 lines, context quality drops off a cliff. We enforce strict separation of concerns partly for good engineering, partly because it keeps the AI accurate.\n\nCurious what your spec documents typically look like. Do you go down to function signatures, or keep it at the module/responsibility level?",

Once you’re past the “first 2–3 files magic”, it turns into this brutal loop: fix one thing, break three, then the AI confidently tells you everything’s fine while the app is literally on fire. The only thing that consistently stopped it for me was doing the same separation you described: spec first → execute second → verify third. When the agent has a hard map, it stops improvising. I’m curious though - when you say Traycer “verifies”, what does that look like in practice? Like: is it checking invariants/acceptance criteria, generating tests, diff constraints, or just an LLM cross-check against the spec? Would love to see a concrete example of a “good” blueprint/spec you feed it (even a redacted one).",

It’s just most folks’ interpretation of enough context is still littered with assumptions! It’s basically the heart of why the well-seasoned programmers here are able to use it to rapidly build things.\n\nNot to exclude myself from this crowd; I routinely will code something out in an unfamiliar language  and it’s too easy to venture into the pure vibes (like a golang pipeline I was looking at yesterday, for example). It’s just about having the humility to be able to say “maybe it’s me and not the algorithm that’s had billions of dollars funneled into it for training and development.” Then you take that humility and you make the damn agent explain to you exactly how the thing works and you have discovered the secondary magic of LLMs!",

I concluded that this wrong info must be stored in Memory or in some working document, so I explained the confusion to Claude, told it that this had happened before, and asked him to search the docs for where the mistake might be coming from.
