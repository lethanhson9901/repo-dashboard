This isn't very documented, many people didn't even know about it and thought that what appeared in the cursor's web panel - tokens, tab and templates used - was all the administrators could see, so they took advantage of it to use it in side projects or even in another company. (I myself admit that I would be on this list if I hadn't promised last year that at this company I wouldn't freak out and follow the rules, everything would be cute.)\n\nHere's a warning to colleagues in the 3 jobs, take care.",

But i must say, it lost its first mover advantage and its shine, especially compared to the new elephant in the room.\n\nThe IDE kind of lost its way since the v2 release, to this day i was using 1.7, the latest proper version.\n\nThe usage capability of the $20 plan became ridiculous but somehow expected, the party couldnt last for long i guess, it was all subsidized and VCs must be pressuring like hell to get some form of profitability.\n\nI dont see how the team can compete, at the end of the day they are just selling a middleware btw users and LLMs. The composer move lasted what, maybe 2 weeks? before getting obliterated by the new big model.\n\nYou know what, i kept the sub alive for the last couple of months only for the famous tab completion, still the best out there. But last few weeks i realized that i was using it way less than before, not enough to justify maintaining the sub (thanks to that big model one-shotting every feature asked with proper planning).\n\nMigrated to a rust-based lighter editor, to save on the nowadays ultra precious RAM.\n\nThis industry is brutal, hard luck to you all and thanks for the ride.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1xrgj515xfg1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fa0d4512b1a883db3a2a12c5eafbec64e300b14\n\n",

Cursor forces you to wait for the next billing cycle before you can work normally again. Claude Code just makes you wait for the next 5-hour window.",

You can compare them with AI provider pricing directly.   \n  \nTo reduce token consumption we relased:   \n\\- Dynamic Context Management: less context required for Agent to do the task, as MCPs/Rules/Logs/etc are fetched without having to attach them all at same time.  \n\\- Subagents: using cheaper models for simpler tasks like code search and returning only info the main agent needs.  \n\\- Efficient tooling: requiring less tokens and less failures which saves tokens as well.  \n\\- And more...\n\nWhat has changed? Models get better which enables you to do more, but they also have higher API pricing which increases cost.\n\nLet me know how you prompt and manage context, I would gladly suggest ways to reduce token consumptions. Less requests does not always result in less cost so it depends on how you use AI.",

I have burnt through an ultra plan in a few days in comparison to other plans that are direct from providers. I am aware that they’re greatly subsidized, and in the long-term, I think once subsidies fall off cursor is going to be in a very good position.  Between now and that time I think finding a way for unlimited auto to make a comeback would be very interesting. \n\nI think the cursor team is doing a fantastic job, but they’re gonna be pushed out of the market due to pricing and that is the entire plan for Claude code.\n\nMy only comment would be do not underestimate the value of transparency with coming to market with an “unlimited auto” plan that has limitations to make the offering viable monetarily. \n\nThe only way cursor loses the development community is through these subsidized plans from providers. Frankly, I would actually encourage cursor to sign a deal with ChatGPT allow allowing for individuals to bring in their Codex subscriptions for a small fee.  That generates revenue for cursor and helps OpenAI gain market share.\n\nI think it is also interesting that OpenAI is going to be releasing garlic that should be incredibly efficient.  That could change a lot of the math that is currently making cursor hard to justify.\n\nLastly, I’d like to thank the cursor team for everything that you guys do. It’s very easy to criticize the work that is being done, but I believe that the IDE that is being built is phenomenal. It is just becoming unviable based on the economics involved.",

Their approach (and that of similar tools) takes around 5 seconds to retrieve the UI tree, whereas my app does this in about 0.5 seconds.\n\nCould you please provide more details about your use case with Apple Sign-In?",

Being able to get that fast feedback loop in Cursor is a game-changer for mobile dev.\n\nI’ve been deep in the same trenches lately, but focusing on the human-input side with my project, **WiFi Mouse**. I noticed most remote tools struggle with 'cursor trailing' or 'ghosting' due to TCP overhead, so I ended up rebuilding the communication logic around **UDP with a custom packet-drop strategy**. It's interesting to see how we both prioritized 'speed' but for different use cases—yours for automation/dev feedback, mine for making a phone feel like a 1:1 physical trackpad.\n\nAside from the ultra-low latency, I’ve packed in things like **Remote Clipboard, Media Controls, and an App Launcher** to make it a full productivity remote.\n\nDef checking out your `ios-builder` repo—Flutter iOS dev on Windows is a massive pain point.

Constantly typing to implement the plan to the point where my elbows hurt. Then at the very end you have this realization! Shifting a few responsibilities of already implemented functionality to another class and introducing one or two extra things would make the whole thing even better, maybe even perfect! \nBut at that point you already spend so much time you can't spend another half a day refactoring, restructuring tests to do basically the same thing but in a different way.\n\nNow I can skip all the work intense implementations and let ai do it for me. And when I see the end result I can refactor it all in one big prompt to be perfect (in my eyes).\n\nSo I try to look at AI from this positive angle, it really allows me to try out all kinds of architectures and implementions really fast until I'm very satisfied instead of having to call it \"good enough, next time ill make it better surely\" and having to move on. I write very long and detailed prompts so the final results basically looks exactly as if I would have written and structured it.",

Also the coding agents take shortcuts and implement ugly hacks all the time and you need experience to detect that and guide it to do things right.\n\nIn my opinion this is actually a great time to learn programming, you can craft your prompts to make the agents teach you while they work, and you can fact check them and double check and this way you will learn by doing. If you limit yourself to vibe coding and just QA testing what the agent does, you will always hit a wall and your apps will become unmanageable.\n\nUse the agents to write the boring boilerplate code, then design how you want your architecture to be and do the skeleton yourself, then have the agent follow your lead then teach you what it did and why.",

But i do heavy planning sessions outside of Cursor.  \nThe core of this (beside beeing very indepth and precise in the planning stage and have a good pdd and prd document) is the interplay between task-master and TDD aproach. Never tried Cursors own planning / task management - mainly because this one works nearly flawless for me. Migth also be to the scope and language of my projects (mainly cli tools in python).\n\nBut inside Cursor, after all is setup - all i do is start a new chat, prompt \"implement next task\" - and then it runs sometimes for half an hour. I had to finetune the mcp files a bit, but essentially each task is split into dozen of subtasks of course, detailed explanation (all done by task-master) and there are always include test writing, running tests until everything works, updating documentation, commiting. Once the agent stops i just review, then open a new chat and start again.  \nContext grows sometimes to 50-70% of this little circle - but as i rarely have to prompt again once the agent stops, i just open a new chat to clean the context.\n\nAnd so far its way superiour than i did without it - i nearly dont have to do those bug hunting sessions anymore where you realize it was going off the rails inbetween and you didnt noticed - or it just implemented something twice, slightly different, because it didnt realized we did this already.",

Typically my plan phases / docs are implemented in 2-4mins without any MCP servers, aiming to keep context under 50% utilisation.  \n\n\nReally good planning is definitely the way, and if you give the AI a detailed enough plan, you don't need expensive LLMs to successfully implement it. The question is now if you have the patience to write & review this sort of plan, and not fall back on using AI to create a low quality, flawed version.",

Its nearly the only mcp tool i use.  \nIf the tasks and subtasks are done correctly (nothing to guess at, small broken down steps together with frequent automated tests) then its really just going.  \nHalf a year ago - yeah, i was filling the context window pretty fast. But now, Cursor itself is pretty smart when prompted correctly (wich the tools are doing) to really just grab the pieces of code it needs.  \nAs i have an entry point each time (a full doc about where things live, how its structured, how functions connect etc.) just for the ai - it reads this at the start of each task and then knows exactly where to look. This saves a ton of tokens it seems.\n\nMy gut feeling is - if the context gets too high while doing a subtask - the subtask was too complex and not broken down enough.\n\nI am not saying this is the perfect aproach - but most of the issues i see people are complaining about or running into are non-existent for me. So my guess is that this is part of the puzzle.  \nIf you want to have a look at how my docs (for ai use) look, or i guess general rules etc. --> the project i am currently working at the side is here: [https://github.com/abhuva/email-agent](https://github.com/abhuva/email-agent)  \nthere is a [readme-ai.md](http://readme-ai.md) that is basically the entry point for each new chat (its always served as context).

It’s \"Infrastructure as Code\" but for AI behavior.\n\nThat sounds like a great flow, but it feels like you're paying a 'Planning Tax' on every new chat. The beauty of the .mdc is that it’s passive. You code the 'Laws of the Land' once, and then you don't need a 'Task-Master' to remind the AI how to behave—the environment itself enforces it.

I have new projects where I have a perfectly clean pattern for doing things and no matter how many times I have my AGENTS.md file optimized, at the end of the day the only way to enforce clean agentic code is by utilizing hooks which can lint, clean, and even spin up sub-agents of their own. Sadly, Claude Code's hook functionality is a year behind the hooks in OpenCode, so it's not as cut and dry to do as I would like. \n\nI have got much better skills and sub-agents now then I did 6 months ago. It's a trial and error process of learning what works and what doesn't. I learned really quickly that those \"libraries\" of Claude Code skills and agents are hot garbage. \n\nThe best skill I ever built for Claude comes with several node scripts and also works on Gemini CLI. It's a one-size-fits-all solution for Playwright screenshots in everything from behind login screens to running Claude in a container. It knows how to take a screenshot perfectly every time in any screen size and with any combination of click and keyboard events - with no fuss and no wasted tokens (Playwright MCP is horrendous at wasting tokens).\n\nAs far as this project goes, I'll have to give it a try. Context management and the stateless nature of these transformer models is the single biggest issue to deal with. It's like you feel yourself repeating yourself every session despite having what you assume is all the info already in AGENTS.md (or equivalent). If tools like this can automatically help with some of these issues then it's at least worth a try. I'll be trying it to see if it's worth the context window cost.",

You can mouse over the token amount and see how much were input/output tokens and how much were cache read and write tokens. Most likely you have majority as cache read tokens. \n\nTo reduce cost for you we utilize caching and the cache read tokens are 90% cheaper than input tokens. \n\nSuggestion:\n- use shorter chats focused on a single specific task.\n- for very complex tasks use Plan mode with a stronger model then start new chat with a regular model to implement the plan. \n- check and cleanup rules as current models require less rules. Only add them if you see a model misses something consistently. \n- avoid attaching files and rules manually. Let agent discover context since it’s more efficient",

Doing so could help reduce our reliance on expensive options like Opus or GPT models and significantly lower costs.\n\nFrom what I’ve heard, these open-source models are already quite strong. They just require more baby sitting and supervision to produce consistent, high-quality outputs, which is completely acceptable for engineering-heavy use cases like ours.\n\nIf anyone from the cursor team has insights on this, it would be really helpful.\n\ncurrently i use both Cursor and GitHub Copilot, both does not provide oss models yet, idk why, isn't this known as gate-keeping?\n\nAnyway thanks, and keep shipping!",

Also, they probably do have deals with openAI / Claude for cheaper API pricing, and these deals might include some clauses against OSS models.\n\n2) Cursor tries not to blindly add models, and each model they have might have tweaks with prompt/tools, which means that adding new models is longer process that to just add a provider + specify model name. Cursor team claims that m2.1/GLM 4.7 do not pass their internal evals, up to you to believe that or not.\n\n3) Related to previous but a bit separate, there seems to be some skill issues on dev team with OSS models. They, somehow, managed to add kimi k2 with a bug(it output a new line for each token) and they don't want to spend dev time on learning how to properly add models.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nFollowing up on my previous thread about [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1qm0yhq/how_are_you_getting_cursor_to_actually_follow/)—I’m still testing the advice people gave there (thanks everyone for the responses!), but now I have a more focused question about models and costs.\n\nI’m on Pro+ and use Cursor full-time at work. I rely on it every day, and that's not going to change. However, the Auto model doesn't meet my expectations of the quality of output, even after making good prompts—the quality of response of more premium models is far better. But premium models burn through tokens very quickly, so I have to restrict their use a lot.\n\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is how other full-time users balance this in practice so that a $60/month plan is actually enough.\n\nMore concretely:\n\n1. How do you structure your model usage so that a $60/month plan works for full-time work?\n   * Do you reserve expensive models only for certain categories of tasks (e.g., architecture, bigger refactors, complex debugging) and use Auto for everything else?\n   * Do you have any rough strategy like \"expensive model only for the first deep pass, then Auto for iterations,\" or a certain percentage of requests you cap it at?\n2. How do you decide *when* to switch from Auto to a better model during a session?\n   * Do you start with Auto and upgrade only if the answer is clearly not good enough, or do you always start with a premium model for some types of tasks?\n   * Do you rewrite/shorten prompts when using expensive models to save tokens, or keep a separate \"short prompt style\" for them?\n3. For people who feel a noticeable quality gap but still stay within $60: what does your day look like?\n   * Rough number of chats/tasks per day.\n   * How often you end up on a premium model in a typical day or week.\n   * Any practical tricks to avoid burning tokens unnecessarily (e.g., resetting vs continuing a long thread, how long you let a thread run on an expensive model, etc.).\n\nI'm not questioning the value of the better models—I actually prefer working with them. I'm just trying to learn from others how to use them *strategically* so that:\n\n* Auto covers as much as possible, and\n* higher-end models are used in a targeted way that fits into a $60/month budget for a full-time job.\n\nFor context: the $60 plan doesn't work for me because at my company I'm basically working alone on the entire application/module, which requires a lot of coding with AI assistance.\n\nWould really appreciate concrete examples of your model mix, settings, and habits. Thanks!",

Every time you want to run something with Opus, you use Claude Code to hit the 5 hour cooldown and then use Cursor to fill in the in-between with composer or auto. The extension allows you to stay inside Cursor and just have yet another agent window for Claude.\n\nThat way, you will still have Cursor as an IDE with their tab completion, but take most of the expensive prompts with the 20 dollar subscription.",

While 'auto' occasionally picks a good model, it’s rare. I know my stack well, so I use specific rules to keep explanations brief—I usually get the gist of it just by reviewing the code anyway.\n\nLately, I haven't been using autocomplete because I’m refactoring two modules with old code. It requires complex reasoning, so I’d rather let a premium AI handle the implementation. I didn't know about the issue with changing providers mid-conversation, though—I’ll definitely avoid that from now on. Thanks for the detailed response!",

          "text": "So, i'm NOT a person you want an answer from, as i'm not a full time user at all. I'm not a dev at all, but just some dude that works on a pretty complex program for over a year now, and since like 4 or 5 months i use Cursor with the 20$ plan. So in know i'm not your target audience; but maybe my strategy isn't all that dumb. \n\nMy workflow is the following:   \n\\- i use Gemini 3 Pro as a \"Senior Coder\". That means: any idea i have; any blueprinting, creating concepts, etc... ANYTHING that's not certain yet, i do in Gemini 3 Pro. \n\n\\- i use Obsidian do keep a good documentation about ideas i have, bugfix reports, concepts, dataflows (with canvas etc) \n\n\\- i use Cursor as a \"coding bot\" without real agency 95% of the time.. . All i let it do is just type out everythign i designed\n\nWith Cursor, i use basically 2 modes: Planing and Building the plan. EVERYTHING i let Cursor do is planned out in advance, i feed that plan into Gemini and ask for feedback; if there's any i incorporate that and then let Cursor build it. Auto Mode almost exclusively. An exception are the times where very, very complex stuff needs to be done or stuff that's very important.\n\nSo basically:\n\n\\- I design the systems, etc and think of my own solutions; prototype Code (usually only elements of it) and then feed that into Gemini 3 Pro\n\n\\- Gemini Pro does the professional thinking; it checks if my idea is doable, if what i prototyped has glaring flaws or issues, thinks of other or different solutions, looks up libraries we will use, and anything that's relevant here. I let Gemini create documents that specify the technical details that are required to make stuff work like intended.\n\n\\- I go into Obsidian, create a prompt for Cursor. Since my professional background is Law, i usually build my prompts like a contract or other legal document; working in many small steps, defining everything i can as precisely as i can. To me it feels like the most important practice in creating the prompt is NEGATIVE definitions. Telling Cursor what we're NOT doing is really helpful. Looks somehting like this: \n\n1. Introduction / Purpose of the prompt (What are we doing and why?) \n2. Definitions (What are the critical components?)\n3. Detailed information (What do we want and why exactly? What's especially important and what's the though process of why we want that?)\n4.  Context (What other, not directly related information could be important to what we're doing?)\n5. Final thoughts\n\n\\- I feed that into Cursor with the \"Plan\"-mode. \n\n\\- The output of that plan is fed back to Gemini and i ask if that's good or not, what we should change, etc. \n\n\\- I let Cursor build the entire plan in Auto-Mode.\n\n  \nThis wokflow, so far, worked really well. I almost never have to correct stuff; re-prompt or change what it does. It just oneshots the entire process; even if it's VERY complex (well, for my standards - as i said: i have a background in Law; not in programming). \n\nLast thing it did was a FULL GUI migration from CustomTKinter to PyQt6 - for a program i'm working on that currently has around 90 individual .py files with a pretty complex back-end, SQL-DB connections, ML-models, etc. \n\nIf i have to correct stuff, it's smaller details like \"this UI element doesnt look like i want to or is in the wrong position\". But functionally, it's a very, very high hit-rate. \n\nMy time spent is almost all outside of Cursor, creating the prompts, etc. Those i just paste in there and let it loose.",

I also leave the heavy lifting (planning etc.) to more complex and capable models, but in my experience, 'auto' still can't cope with the complexity of my program.
