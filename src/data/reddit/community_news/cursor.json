      "text": "Here is a process that I've found quite enjoyable. And I'm learning a lot too. When I'm implementing something using cursor, I switch it from Agent to Tutorial mode.\n\nI know, there is no tutorial mode. But you can set up a command for this quite easily!\n\nHere is what I do:\n\n1. I start a new chat agent\n2. I switch to \"plan\" mode and usually use Claude 4.5 sonnet\n3. I write as much detail as I can about the problem I want to solve, the bug I'm fixing, or the feature I'm implementing. And I feed the prompt a few files or sections of code when relevant.\n4. I let it plan out the solution\n5. Then I switch to \"plan\" mode (and usually a lower cost model like Gemini 3 Flash) and add my \\`tutorial\\` command to the prompt\n\nThen instead of the agent changing numerous files and fixing the issue without a lot of intervention, it prompts me to fix it step by step. I create the new files, I copy and paste the new code (sometime I even type it myself). And gradually I implement the new feature.\n\nI find this process to be much more satisfying. I have a much better model of what is happening in my app. And I can interrupt the tutorial at any time by asking questions, suggesting changes, discovering flaws in the plan right when they present themselves.\n\nHere is my current version of the plan. Personally, I enjoy using TDD, and so I have my tutorials follow that pattern. \n\n    # tutorial\n    \n    Let's switch into tutorial mode, where you walk me through the steps, one at a time. I make all the changes.\n    \n    Whenever possible, we should write a test first. Let's not wait for the tests to be made at the end. For instance, let's add breaking tests first, before we implement the code. Again, DON'T make the changes. Instead, walk ME through the steps, one at a time and have me write the tests and the code.\n    \n    Make the steps incremental, one block of code, function or component at a time, I should not be adding an entire file longer than 50 lines all at once.\n\nPlease note, you may want another command like \"/end-tutorial\" or \"/pause-tutorial\" that stops tutorial mode when you just want the agent to take over and make the changes for you.\n\nObviously this approach is much slower, but it also uses a lot less tokens and the output is often much closer to what I want.

For that specific problem I generate a visual canvas to in Cursor to be able to follow each step and implement with micro steps.\n\nIt is like n8n style canvas in your Cursor which you create nodes, then you generate specs, then you generated automated tests as a valid verification point and then Let AI until all the expected details of the features completed.\n\nYou can auto run all proces or do it manually by yourself.\n\nIt is opensource and you can download as a Cursor Extension. called TDAD.  \nThis is pretty new and probably has lots of bugs but it does the job.\n\nI can share the github link if anyone finds interesting.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u136opfx37eg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=378bda8f65fc6a698b087ea5f03bfd5a8223fb2d",

Fewer tokens. :) Also you may have made a typo as you say that you switch from plan mode to plan mode.\n\nI would add that it shouldn't give you snippets of code to copy paste, that instead it should explain what you need to do at a higher level.

I would lean towards using GPT 5.2, it has a very good understanding of high level and complex things and is great at explaining and holding its ground.",

The two primary arguments are around price and orchestration.\n\n  \nI haven't really done anything with Claude Code, but I will try it at some point. What is keeping it a low priority is:\n\n  \n1) $200/month of Cursor is keeping me perfectly busy. I haven't spent so much time coding and loving it since college in the 90's\n\n  \n2) I can't get my head around all this talk of orchestration. I have two separate agents for the front and backend of my main project and one for each other project I have. It's a total of 5 agents currently -- one per cursor window.\n\nIt's all I can do to keep up with those 5 and review all the code. Am I just completely missing how fleets of agents would make my work faster? You still need to review the code before deploying to production, right? Right?\n\n3) My assumption is I could run as many agents as I want in Cursor, what is really the advantage there of Claude Code?\n\nMaybe I should post this in their subreddit\n\n  \n",

The actual capability of Opus seems to be slightly better in Cursor. But the biggest difference is how I could follow along the thinking path of the model in Cursor compared to CC, and how I could see all of the changes they made as saved but not yet approved clearly and individually reject or modify without losing which parts are modified in Cursor. Also going back and forth by changes in the staging before commit is very important for me. I also tried the cursor extension of CC, same thing.

If some customers use $35 of tokens and the same amount of customers use $25 of tokens, that averages out to $30 and Cursor breaks even. If more customers don’t use the full allocation, Cursor profits. They can set their limit higher because a lot of their customers won’t use the full allocation every month. The more people that don’t use the full allocation, the higher they can set their limits. What you want to do is roll the credits over so everybody gets maximum usage. This breaks the pricing model because now Cursor is selling $35 of service for $30.\n\nIf you don’t like it, then you can go to another provider and pay by token, but when you do this, you will be paying $30 for a $30 limit, not $30 for a $35 limit.",

I almost get the impression that it's in the system prompt until it wraps up the task, which makes it really nice especially for long lived sessions.\n\nIt coded for 45 minutes. 45 minutes in a row without stopping. Crunched the tasklist and iterated (with typechecks) until it was achieved. Then code reviewed with a separate agent & fixed that as well.\n\nLaunching multiple agents in parallel seems to be the way to go, especially if you define a frontend plan and a backend plan, they will work independently and converge at the end.\n\nI used to spend 1000+$ on cursor per month, this is just \"personal\" money not including any 9-5, was getting too expensive for the output it produced which in all honesty was subpar at best and it felt like you were paying for broken stuff.",

ChapGPT can spot some issues but I had to handhold it a lot more and feels more like the old teacher that is playing catch up. Not sure if I was using Composer correctly.  \n  \nClaude Code seems to use less tokens to do more. I haven't gotten any usage warnings yet for 20x usage. It's better at having full context on your repository and not getting stuck in fucked up hallucination loops that can cost a lot of credits to try and fix. If I do hit an issue, it only takes a couple prompts to correct and you're not fighting with it to make it understand what you want. Good at going over my old Cursor code and standardizing it, getting rid of over-optimizations, redundancies and stuff. Terminal doesn't have picture import but I haven't really found myself needing it yet, and you can use VS Code if you really need a wrapper. So far it feels like one solution that fits all my gamedev needs.",

I recommend having both subscription but not the 200 dollars in any of them. You have to combine subs from different places to survive without ruining your finances. Keep the $60 cursor (or the $20), keep the $20 claude (for claude code), keep the $20 ChatGPT (use codex cli). When you need more juice you can buy more codex credits, affordable.

In Cursor I use a variety of models, for planning and architecture Opus or GPT 5.2 High or xhigh. Then I have composer implement after the plan. If stuck I use Opus or GPT for issues or heavier tasks. I’d estimate you can import the repo to CC and have the agent get an overview and prepare docs to get familiar with the repo. You can summarize context later on in CC with a pre defined terminal command as far as I know. There are many yt videos on Claude Code - I’m sure there’s one that answers your question better than I can.\n\nYou could also just clone the repo and try it on the cheaper plan and see for yourself how Claude handles that.

I pay for the $60 plan and can get about a week of work out of it with Opus 4.5 (and that is being generous). Some times I can only go 2 days without going over the limit. It just depends on the work. Then in order to get more done, you pay more and more. I’ve spent upwards of $200-300 in a month. Compare that to Claude Code where I could spend $100 and virtually never hit the limit. I still prefer the Cursor experience these days, but it may be worth looking elsewhere.\n\nEdit: it’s important to keep in mind this example is leveraging the Opus 4.5 exclusively. I prefer to work with this model because it works so well. You can get enormously more usage using other models.\n\nEdit: Addressing your comment about Opus flailing on your project, I feel there may be an issue with your workflow.

Gives you more options for LLM's (including all of the Claude and GPT models and pretty much any model that comes to mind really)\n\nAnd the big difference! is that you know how many tokens you are spending per request UP FRONT.\n\nI wrote a little article recently as I was testing Cursor out again after about a year of not using it. Should pretty much sum up your experience.\n\n[https://marwankhalife.hashnode.dev/why-im-ditching-cursor-for-windsurf-a-55-lesson-in-predictability](https://marwankhalife.hashnode.dev/why-im-ditching-cursor-for-windsurf-a-55-lesson-in-predictability)",

There is another shopify dev who is working and occupy him about 30% of his time too with this. \n\nSaved myself a  few hours per day and some frustration because I can't keep a consistent schedule and emails / tasks go forgotten and unanswered. Now they don't with a claude code.\n\nAvoided about 50k in contract breach fines because other devs are just unskilled or unwilling to work efficiently. Took over their stuff and did it myself. You can't tell me shit takes 1 week when I can 1 shot it in cursor with opus while doing 3 other projects at the same time and being in random customers calls.\n\nAt the moment I have about 1/3 of the remaining devs that I don't trust to deliver just hanging around. Need to see if I can find them a purpose or let them go. Will prob save us another 20k /mo. \n\nUnfortunately the ceo doesn't like layoffs.",

Including full automatic deployment script and nightly backup and a full project documentation — took about two weeks of like 2-4 hours work each day, and I am pretty happy with the result. I‘ve limited the agent to Gemini-Flash-3 and it could deal with all issues easily, fulfilled all my special UI requests neatly and even made some great suggestions on some additional polishing (and I am still a bit flashed by the general oversight of the agent, thinking of three other places to adapt things that I only looked at in one specific area…). \nUsage costs so far is like 60€ (which I think is a joke given the work that went into it, the amount of code that was produced and the final functionality being delivered), so 40€ beyond the Pro limit, but I didn‘t quite understand the dashboard, because so far all is displayed as „included“ and my on-demand budget is still untouched…",

I have added cursor rules to use a specific ui kit and write it in my prompts too, and it still manages to write custom garbage code.\nMy struggle is it sometimes does a heavy lifting in just a couple of hours on a new big functionality and then it takes way more time fine tuning the edges.\nI guess if I was working on a paid project I would still use it, but can’t decide whether I want to spend 100s of $ for using it on a side project",

      "text": "I’ve been exclusively \"vibe coding\" for the last 3 months building a full-stack Next.js app, and I realized that typing out long context prompts was actually the biggest bottleneck in my workflow.\n\nI spent the last few weeks optimizing my setup to reduce friction between \"having an idea\" and \"Cursor writing the code.\" Here is the current stack that is working for me:\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet: Obviously. The reasoning capabilities for refactoring large files are just unmatched right now.\n\nWillow Voice: I use this to dictate my prompts instead of typing them. It handles technical jargon like \"useEffect\" really well and helps me dump context into the chat without breaking flow.\n\nV0 (Vercel): I use this for the initial UI scaffolding. I paste the V0 code into Cursor and let Claude handle the logic.\n\nCleanShot X: Essential for taking screenshots of UI bugs. \"Fix this\" plus a screenshot is infinitely faster than describing a CSS misalignment.\n\nCursor Directory: A great resource I found for grabbing specific .cursorrules files for different tech stacks like Tailwind or Supabase.\n\nPostman: Still the best for testing the API endpoints Claude generates before I try to wire them up to the frontend.\n\nSizzy: A developer browser that lets me see the app on mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes simultaneously while I’m iterating.\n\nKey takeaway: The less I touch the keyboard to explain the code, and the more I use screenshots or tools to provide context, the faster I ship.\n\nHas anyone else found tools that speed up the \"prompting\" phase specifically?",

At $14 per M output, it slots quite nicely between Opus @ $25 and Sonnet @ $15 (I'm using API keys).\n\nI find Codex is great as an all-rounder, can handle planning and coding and one surprising thing is it pushes back quite a lot on user prompt assumptions. I'm relying less on Opus and saving a lot. Sure Codex and Sonnet are still expensive, but all my expense is on company dime anyways, but I still like to keep expenses down just for ROIs sake.\n\nI recommend if you're using Opus a lot, or even Sonnet, give Codex a try. Btw, I hated GPT 5.2 as it needed much more hand-holding, but Codex seems vastly different.",

          "text": "Look into a process called Research -> Plan -> Implement. I have this workflow implemented as custom slash commands in Cursor. I built mine using ChatGPT, I imagine everyone is going to want to tune their prompts a little differently. But you want the commands to have some basic properties. Research and Plan should have guardrails to ensure they do not modify code, they just do analysis work and output a markdown file capturing that analysis. Research and Plan should also be told to \"do a deep analysis\" because otherwise the agent will often do a very surface level analysis that is incomplete or inaccurate. All custom commands should have some general guidance that reinforces things like following cursor rules or the agent files.\n\nThe Research command is all about establishing ground truth. What is the current state of the repository in relation to your requirements, what files are relevant to your requirements, are the requirements partially implemented, are there any blockers to implementing your requirements, etc. This command can be useful to establishing your baseline context before implementing a task but it's also useful for auditing your implementation after the fact (like, was the task fully implemented and are there any quality issues?). This will output a research markdown file capturing all of its findings.\n\nI will very frequently run the Research command AFTER implementation with a prompt to verify that the task was fully implemented and to verify that code written follows best practices, agent rules, etc. If it finds any gaps in the implementation I'll just create a plan to close the gaps. This loop makes it far more feasible to complete complex tasks because your essentially using multiple iterations to drift correct.\n\nThe Plan command pretty much works like the built in plan command, but it can be useful to roll your own so you can make it more rigorous both in how deep it analyzes the requirements and how detailed the final plan is.\n\nIt's also useful to have the Research and Plan commands capture a snapshot of the requirements in their output so subsequent steps have that context available to them.\n\nThe Implement command is also similar to just running the prompt in agent mode but again, defining it as a custom command let's you reinforce guardrails (must follow agent rules, must make small targeted edits, must lint and test all changes, etc.) Some people like to have the Implement command output an implementation summary markdown file, I personally prefer to have it output the summary in the chat. Also, I recommend putting guidance in the Implement command to have it stop and ask for clarification if any of the requirements are incomplete or ambiguous, this will also save a lot of headaches and can prevent drift.\n\nWhen your executing a task you would do something like:\n\n\\- /research <your prompt with your requirements>\n\n\\- /plan <the research markdown file produced in the previous step>\n\n\\- /implement <the plan markdown file produced in the previous step>\n\nFor smaller tasks you can often skip the Research step, but at least doing the Plan step will save a lot wasted time and credits. One of the key things that the Research and Plan markdown files give you is a chance to review what the agent is going to do before it tries to implement the changes. I have my custom commands include open questions if anything is unclear, and I'll usually spend a few minutes dialing in the markdown file before I move on to the next step. If your Research is dialed in you have a much higher chance of producing a solid plan and if you produce a solid plan you have a much higher change of actually implementing it.\n\nThe other big thing that outputting these markdown files give you is context that you can include in a new chat which I think is critical for context management. I'll typically run Research and Plan in a single chat but I almost always run Implement in a new chat because the agents can really suck after you've used more than like 50% of the context. I have the commands put my markdown files in a tmp/ directory in the workspace which I .gitignore.\n\nFrom my experience, this has sped up my workflow because I don't have to do rework nearly as often and has actually reduced credit use. It also lets me rely on auto mode for most tasks. People throwing Opus at everything probably just have workflow issues. I think a big part of why it reduces credit use is that running a prompt without the research or plan artifacts means the agent has to establish context like where files are and it's super inefficient at this. Front-loading that analysis mean the Implement command knows where it's supposed to be working and it can focus it's effort on actually writing code rather than building that baseline context.\n\nThere are tons of ways to make your actual coding more efficient which are very stack dependent, but I think establishing a solid workflow is the first step in really making efficient use of Cursor. Also, if you create these custom commands and you see behavior you don't like, you can always just tune the command. If I run into issues with one of my commands I copy it to ChatGPT, explain what it's doing wrong, what I would like it to do, and ask ChatGPT to revise my command to fix the issue. Then I copy the updated command back into Cursor and get back to work.",

      "text": "I purchased an annual subscription last year and had been enjoying using cursor a tonne. However, when my subscription auto-renewed I noticed that my token usage spiked incredibly. Turns out when they made the change to API-based pricing in September, I assume it had immediately affected my subscription but no, it only came into play once my subscription renewed.\n\nI raised this as a concern to them once I noticed the discrepancy, and asked if I could cancel my account for a refund (so I could upgrade to the pro/max plan, as while on the yearly I can't change my plan). The response was that as soon as a yearly subscription renews, thats it. You're stuck, no refund, bad luck.\n\nI asked if I could simply \"convert\" the \\~£300 yearly subscription into a monthly subscription for 2 months, but:\n\n>Annual subscriptions can’t be converted into monthly plans or translated into credits for other plans. Once an annual plan renews, it remains active for the full term.\n\n>You can cancel the annual subscription to prevent renewal at the end of the term, but the current annual period can’t be refunded, shortened, or exchanged for monthly plans.\n\n>I know this isn’t the outcome you were hoping for, but this is our final position. If you want help optimizing usage within your current plan or understanding which plan will make sense once the annual term ends, I’m happy to help.\n\nSo I'm now out of pocket for \\~£300 on my current plan, which doesn't cover my usage, and have had to pay an extra \\~£100 for the incurred usage outside of my plan (which is partially my fault for having PAYG switched on, but hadn't had an issue with it previously).\n\nI've now cancelled and switching over to Claude Code. It's a shame, I had really enjoyed using Cursor but this kind of money-grabbing and inflexibility sucks.",

Auto mode gets a bad rap because it invisibly downgrades after you burn through tokens, but if you've got well-structured requirements and clear commands, the model gap shrinks fast.\n\nThe Opus-for-planning pattern is smart though. Big model for architecture decisions, auto for execution. That's basically how I've been thinking about model routing in general... use the expensive reasoning for the parts that need it, not for every keystroke.",
