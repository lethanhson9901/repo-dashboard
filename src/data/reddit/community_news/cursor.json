I'll just have to talk to my PR department for a sec... \")  \n\\- if you try to critisize Antrophic or Claude in their Reddit channels the post gets deleted immediately. Only if you prais them, that's ok!  \n\\- while they are rate limiting they also always start campaigns where their employees post gaslighting posts where they explain \"10 techniques to effectively use Claude bla bla\" - like, why would I use Claude if I have to \"manage\" and babysit it's context with all the time I saved. Cue in the followup bot posts accusing everyone \"it isn't degraded, you're doing it wrong! Read Antrophics context management post!\"\n\nTL;DR: Don't go into bed with snakes.",

It’s very token efficient and gives AI the right approach to finding causes, then fixing them. \n- try out different models that may be equal in capability but less costly, learn how those models work and how to prompt best for them. \n- where possible, charge clients for AI usage as it’s a tool for developers.",

I'm not talking about like cracked or some like really smart, I'm talking about cracked as in someone who's actively trying to work for Microsoft and get a green card because it's so competitive. You get someone, a really cracked Ghanaian coder to work for you for around, honestly, because they probably won't go down below $250 a month. You're telling me Claude is not smarter than a Ghanaian coder making $250 a month. I'm sorry, that's just fact. Someone with 20 years experience who's been building apps for years but just can't get a green card. Claude is not better than that guy. This is one of the, I don't think it's a bubble. Like, not to mention, the fact that every time they update their code base, all the code you make from, say, six months ago is now really old because you use an old depreciated model that wasn't even smart. Like, you get what I'm saying? It's just such a bad business model when you really, really think about it. Because let's just say you're building a calculator, and you used, you know, Sonnet 1.0, Sonnet 2.2. Now we are on Sonnet 4.5. If someone builds the same app, takes a screenshot of your app, and puts it in Sonnet, they get a TI-84 while your, while your old calculator can barely do calculations. This calculation can't even go on the internet because they use Opos. A Ghanaian coder would just, hell, they can even have a $20, a Ghanaian coder with a $20 Cloud subscription could just even do a better job than using Kesha. Not even Kesha, Kesha, all these AI and their, their talking users on Kesha are a big issue, and honestly, straight up, there's a reason why banks make it hard to get a subscription there. I'm sure eventually it's gonna be one of those Chinese fake um shoes markets like Panda Buy where you can only use PayPal. Because this is crazy. I've made apps and then six months later, I ask the Cloud can one prompt create my whole app. Like, to them that's an advancement. To me, I got robbed because I paid $400 to make this app, and now you can do it one prompt for a $20 membership. That's robbery.",

      "text": "I see a lot of posts here claiming the models are getting \"stupider\" or \"lazy\" after updates. I used to have the same issue until I changed my workflow.\n\nI call it the **Columbo Method**. Yes, the 1970s TV show detective.\n\nThe philosophy is simple: Treat your codebase like a crime scene where you don't know what happened. You play the role of the confused detective. You get the agent to \"lock in on their story\" first, and only when you are absolutely sure they know the truth do you \"set the trap\" (hit Apply).\n\nHere is the exact workflow I use to save tokens, stop hallucinations, and fix complex bugs.\n\n### 1. The Investigation (Ask Mode)\n\nNever start by telling the agent to fix something. Start by acting like a confused co-worker. I always use `Ask` mode first.\n\n**The Prompt:** *\"I am logged into the app and when I click this button, it does that. It should do this. Can you review exactly how this works and look for any potential issues?\"*\n\nThis forces **retrieval**. It scans the files to answer your question, effectively loading the correct context into its window before it tries to solve anything.\n\n### 2. \"Just One More Thing...\" (Rhetorical Questions)\n\nIf the agent gives you a generic answer, don't build yet. Channel your inner Columbo and ask rhetorical questions about edge cases. You are verifying that it actually understands the logic and isn't just guessing.\n\n**The Prompt:** *\"In our current implementation, if a user does X, what happens? What happens if they also do Y? And wait, what if the network fails here?\"*\n\nKeep doing this until the explanation matches reality 100%. If it hallucinates here, it costs you nothing. If it hallucinates while coding, it costs you an hour of debugging.\n\n### 3. The Confession (Plan Mode)\n\nOnce the agent has \"locked in its story,\" switch to `Composer (Plan)` mode.\n\n**The Prompt:** *\"Create a concrete implementation plan for this fix.\"*\n\nThis generates a markdown file (like a `plan.md`). This is crucial because LLMs have recency bias. If the chat gets long, the agent might forget the start. The Plan file is a permanent anchor you can reference later. Review this manually. **If the plan is wrong, the code will be wrong.**\n\n### 4. The Execution\n\nOnly now—after the investigation, the interrogation, and the written confession—do I actually let it write code.\n\n1. Reference the Plan file.\n2. Select your smartest model (e.g., Opus 4.5 thinking).\n3. Click Build.\n\nStop trying to vibe code and start acting like a detective. It changes everything.",

Cursor will likely lose a lot of users in the future because there will be little value in coding with cheaper models.  You already see this happening, Opus 4.5 isn't cheap and yet who would build anything significant on anything else?\n\nPeople aren't going to be able to afford to learn the high end models that companies want to hire for without a significant investment.  \n\nThere is no future where the cutting edge model is also the most affordable.  This means a lot less users for products like Cursor, at some point - probably this year.  This is why I believe they don't really care about their current customers.",

It will even check if we have DB indexes setup already, related schemas, and interact with AWS using some other scripts if I allow it to. \n\nIt took like a day to build these. But I am not an engineer by trade. That said, my lead engineer on the API and DB both reviewed and approved the skills and outputs after some minor feedback, so that was reassuring!",

A common claim is that AI boosts productivity for junior developers but actually *reduces* productivity for senior devs.\n\nThat makes me wonder: am I secretly a junior in disguise, or are people just dumb and not using AI very effectively?\n\nPersonally, I’ve found AI to be a huge productivity boost. As I’ve gained more experience using it—and as the models themselves have improved—I’ve noticed I’m making fewer mistakes, not more. While people often say “AI writes bad code,” even setting code generation aside, the gains from faster debugging, troubleshooting, research, and environment setup feel very real.\n\nFor example, I recently ran into MySQL Workbench issues after an upgrade. ChatGPT helped me diagnose and fix it in about 15 minutes. Years ago, that would’ve meant trawling through docs and Stack Overflow threads for hours.\n\nCurious what others think, especially senior devs. Has AI actually hurt your productivity, or does it depend on how you use it? Why is there this narrative that it's not helping with productivity??",

They are definitely coding faster and building cool internal tools. **However**, our official project timelines? **Zero change.**\n\n**Why?** Because in a corporate environment, 'writing code' was never the bottleneck. The bottleneck is alignment, meetings, PR reviews, CI/CD pipelines, legacy integration, and compliance.\n\nAI made the 'typing' part instant, but it didn't solve the organizational friction.

For example, there may be some code refactoring or cleanup that we can whip through quickly and just get done. There's not necessarily any immediate impact for end users or for bottom line revenues - the benefit comes 8 years later when a junior developer has to write a new method and it's easier for her because someone else cleaned up the code 8 years prior.

Turns out she was using it incorrectly. But I hooked her up with greptile and she was blown away. It's caught so many little weird issues that can creep in. Some findings don't fit our architecture and flows exactly since we have some hacky ways of doing things, but we just create a rule when that happens to clean it up. \n\nI'm separately building a ground up new version of one of our core apps in completely diff environment (vercel for now, instead of AWS) and just connecting to our APIs for data. Its in classic ai stack of node (not next), react, typescript, tailwind. I have been using AI tools since early 2023 so I have a pretty rock solid environment setup for it. I built all of our existing functionality in about 3 weeks and am now enhancing and expanding things building in features our customers have wanted for years, but we're difficult or impossible to build in our legacy app. Frontend is super quick, like multiple releases a week, and backend stuff is still pretty fast when I need to make changes. Main bottleneck there is testing and review for anything that might touch DB or handle sensitive pii/phi, and managing AWS environment for a few things that deal with those services. \n\nIt's crazy because I am not a dev and only have about 2.5yrs of comp sci under my belt (2005-2007, so we were just getting deep into JavaScript when I switched majors). I am very technical, building PCs and doing script kiddie shit from childhood, and was a senior server and network admin for many years, so I understand things at a high level and know to be careful. But my code passes human and AI reviews regularly, and I take care to run multiple security evals each month just to be sure (will prob automate this once I can get a budget for another CC or codex sub).",

Once the hacks are untwisted development is *much* faster... and the whole codebase is now available to be improved going forward.\n\nIt was a tough month of work, even with AI assistance, and a comparatively small codebase, so I can see why some do not see much of a speedup, but with effort it really speeds development.",

Huge huge project. It delivered on time with no issues and the team was cut in half near the end.\n\nYou are right though, if AI is only doing code gen, then the entire SDLC won’t speed up much.

Don’t get me wrong, I hate paying for cursor too.\n\nThe closest I’d say out of all of them that have this context awareness is windsurf. You can tell it does have some deeper searching abilities over just grep. However cursor really perfected this total awareness and that’s why they have a monopoly and can charge as much as they do. The models themselves are cheaper elsewhere sure, but where cursor shines is the context",

Claude shows the changes and if something isn't right I just tell it to undo. \n\nThat said, Opus is amazing and as long as you prompt it correctly, it works near flawlessly. \n\nI do still have Cursor just to easily browse files and run commands in terminal, but I could do the same with VScode.\n\nYou can still easily attach screenshots, past text, etc in the CLI, so I didn't lose much with the switch and I'm saving a ton of money, not having to deal with the massive bugs, performance issues, etc.\n\np.s. I think one of the biggest advantages is its ability to spawn sub agents and actually monitor and respond to builds. GPT and Opus would always say \"I'll monitor the build\" in Cursor, but it never worked. I was always telling it, \"it finished\" or \"there was an error\". Using Claude Code in Powershell it actually works. Saving me tons of time.\n\nAlso, I have some guest passes for one free week of Claude if you want to try it out. https://claude.ai/referral/IszzqSDf_w",

Today I'm using my $200 plan and I've already passed $60 of usage so I'm trying to just work in Auto mode to save money, but since I did that it still seems to be rising at about the same pace.\n\nIs everyone experiencing the same thing? I know my project has gotten rather large but I'm trying to make my queries very focused on one specific issue at a time but each query still seems to cost a decent amount of money.\n\nIs the issue that I simply need to create a new convo because the one I'm in is simply just bleeding cash or is this just the new state of Cursor as a whole?\n\n\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*: Okay I spoke with support and they clarified the issue. Ever since they've allowed indexing a convo, I've kind of just been running the same convo for like a month straight. THIS is absolutely killing my bill. The cached convo tokens are like 5x the usage of every other thing I'm doing.\n\nBasically by maintaining the same convo, I'm causing myself to have exponentially higher costs with every message I send no matter how small it is.\n\nI knew this was how it used to work but I assumed once the indexing process started this was no longer an issue but actually it's a bigger issue than ever because it causes people like my to let convos go on for WAY too long.\n\nThey also let me know that the $200 plan allows for $400 of usage which also made me feel better.\n\nNot to be a huge ass kisser but I was very happy with their very fast response and full explanation of my specific issue so thank you Cursor team!\n\n  \n\\*\\*Edit\\*\\*: [PSA: Indexing Your Conversational Context DOES NOT Index Your Cost! : r/cursor](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1qv5903/psa_indexing_your_conversational_context_does_not/) here I made a different post essentially just saying START A NEW CONVO OR YOUR COSTS WILL BE ASTRONOMICAL OVER TIME lol",

That's crazy... it most definitely changed.\nI never used opus 4.5 BTW cause i know that is super expensive, but I did switched from auto to sonnet 4.5 cause auto was reeeeally stupid now (which is also something that I noticed within this year of usage) auto was not that dumb before( I guess it was using sonnet 4.5?)\n\n\nAnyways, I'm kinda cooked now cause I'm a new dev with only 1 year of experience and I was developing so much with cursor assistance, but since the AI cover the syntax, I could focus on studying and learning about architecture/business logic... there's no way I could develop so much so fast without it to cover the syntax",

Since around September 2025, new subscriptions started being charged, and when you changed your plan, you lost the old free Auto plan, which was supposed to stay free for early subscribers for at least a year.\n\nAuto is just a dynamic LLM selector based on Cursor’s internal decision based on docs and stack  notes. I highly doubt it ever picks top tier models like Opus for serious reasoning. In practice, it seems to jump between models like Grok and GPT pretty quickly. \nSam mentioned that the model should be chosen based on prompt difficulty, but that doesn’t mean it will always pick a strong one.\n\nI wouldn’t call Auto a “dumb agent,” but it’s clearly weaker than using Opus or even Sonnet directly. With a well-specified and correct plan, Auto usually works fine for me. The real difference is this: when Auto generates a plan, I almost always need to tweak and adapt it. When I use Opus, 99.9% of the time the plan is already efficient and usable as-is.\n\nAlso, you don’t need a top model to execute the plan. The smart way is to switch agents by phase: use Opus for planning, then use something like Sonnet to actually implement it, even auto should work fine.",

Got carried away a bit with it. Use a preset or color picker and grab the prompt, also got froggy with attempting to get a Hero Styler and Text Styler, but those are buggy as all get out.  It was really fun having the agents go wild, hardest coaxing was getting tailwind to have include list for unused styles in the build. Really falling in love with building again.",

It got me wondering — will Cursor continue to improve their Tab feature?\n\nAs someone who relies heavily on Tab in my daily work, I genuinely believe it helps me translate my ideas into code quickly and exactly as intended, without any black box concerns.\n\nI’m not against Agent by any means. In fact, within specific and controlled scenarios, I do use Agent to speed up certain tasks. However, I avoid using it for functions involving complex logic or spanning multiple modules, as that introduces uncontrollable risks and makes it hard to ensure accurate understanding of intricate business requirements.\n\nCursor's Tab is fast, smart, and incredibly efficient — but I really hope they keep evolving it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Cursor’s Tab feature?",

Tab and Agent serve different needs - Tab keeps you in control for precise, surgical edits while Agent is better for scaffolding or repetitive tasks where you don't care as much about the exact implementation.\n\nYou're right to avoid Agent for complex logic IMO. The risk isn't just that it might be wrong, it's that you lose the mental model of what's happening in your own code. That's the actual trade-off most people don't talk about.\n\nAs for whether they'll keep improving Tab - hard to say.

It reads my mind.\n\nI tried to stick back to supermaven in nvim but Tab is just a different world. Sadly, cuz they would never make it editor agnostic...\n\nI just hope that \\*some day\\* there will be same-ish autocomplete service that I can stuff into my neovim and I could ditch all these vscode forks alltogether.\n\nor at least Zed's autocomplete becomes good enough, Zed is the middle ground for me :)",

The element bounds + metadata feels like it would cut prompt back-and-forth a lot. Do you have any tips for keeping the agent from making breaking UI changes when it only sees a slice of the screen? I have been writing up some agent UX patterns lately too: https://www.agentixlabs.com/blog/",
