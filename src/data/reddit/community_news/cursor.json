Benchmarks show they do the best in high abstraction languages and progressively worse as the language is less abstract: python > js > java > c++ > assembly. Most of the progress currently done in agents today is compressing context so they have more data available to them in the same space",

      "text": "Here is a process that I've found quite enjoyable. And I'm learning a lot too. When I'm implementing something using cursor, I switch it from Agent to Tutorial mode.\n\nI know, there is no tutorial mode. But you can set up a command for this quite easily!\n\nHere is what I do:\n\n1. I start a new chat agent\n2. I switch to \"plan\" mode and usually use Claude 4.5 sonnet\n3. I write as much detail as I can about the problem I want to solve, the bug I'm fixing, or the feature I'm implementing. And I feed the prompt a few files or sections of code when relevant.\n4. I let it plan out the solution\n5. Then I switch to \"plan\" mode (and usually a lower cost model like Gemini 3 Flash) and add my \\`tutorial\\` command to the prompt\n\nThen instead of the agent changing numerous files and fixing the issue without a lot of intervention, it prompts me to fix it step by step. I create the new files, I copy and paste the new code (sometime I even type it myself). And gradually I implement the new feature.\n\nI find this process to be much more satisfying. I have a much better model of what is happening in my app. And I can interrupt the tutorial at any time by asking questions, suggesting changes, discovering flaws in the plan right when they present themselves.\n\nHere is my current version of the plan. Personally, I enjoy using TDD, and so I have my tutorials follow that pattern. \n\n    # tutorial\n    \n    Let's switch into tutorial mode, where you walk me through the steps, one at a time. I make all the changes.\n    \n    Whenever possible, we should write a test first. Let's not wait for the tests to be made at the end. For instance, let's add breaking tests first, before we implement the code. Again, DON'T make the changes. Instead, walk ME through the steps, one at a time and have me write the tests and the code.\n    \n    Make the steps incremental, one block of code, function or component at a time, I should not be adding an entire file longer than 50 lines all at once.\n\nPlease note, you may want another command like \"/end-tutorial\" or \"/pause-tutorial\" that stops tutorial mode when you just want the agent to take over and make the changes for you.\n\nObviously this approach is much slower, but it also uses a lot less tokens and the output is often much closer to what I want.

The two primary arguments are around price and orchestration.\n\n  \nI haven't really done anything with Claude Code, but I will try it at some point. What is keeping it a low priority is:\n\n  \n1) $200/month of Cursor is keeping me perfectly busy. I haven't spent so much time coding and loving it since college in the 90's\n\n  \n2) I can't get my head around all this talk of orchestration. I have two separate agents for the front and backend of my main project and one for each other project I have. It's a total of 5 agents currently -- one per cursor window.\n\nIt's all I can do to keep up with those 5 and review all the code. Am I just completely missing how fleets of agents would make my work faster? You still need to review the code before deploying to production, right? Right?\n\n3) My assumption is I could run as many agents as I want in Cursor, what is really the advantage there of Claude Code?\n\nMaybe I should post this in their subreddit\n\n  \n",

Not sure if I was using Composer correctly.  \n  \nClaude Code seems to use less tokens to do more. I haven't gotten any usage warnings yet for 20x usage. It's better at having full context on your repository and not getting stuck in fucked up hallucination loops that can cost a lot of credits to try and fix. If I do hit an issue, it only takes a couple prompts to correct and you're not fighting with it to make it understand what you want. Good at going over my old Cursor code and standardizing it, getting rid of over-optimizations, redundancies and stuff. Terminal doesn't have picture import but I haven't really found myself needing it yet, and you can use VS Code if you really need a wrapper. So far it feels like one solution that fits all my gamedev needs.",

Some don’t care, since they prefer an IDE and don’t like working in the Terminal. If that however is no problem to you, switch those 200 bucks to Claude Code and you’ll have more usage. You’d however still need an IDE to view changes, but then you don’t need another paid plan (for Cursor) and can just use VS Code.",

For web dev or mainly UI/frontend I use Flash in Antigravity, since it’s basically for free and the output is alright for that use case. In Cursor I use a variety of models, for planning and architecture Opus or GPT 5.2 High or xhigh. Then I have composer implement after the plan. If stuck I use Opus or GPT for issues or heavier tasks. I’d estimate you can import the repo to CC and have the agent get an overview and prepare docs to get familiar with the repo. You can summarize context later on in CC with a pre defined terminal command as far as I know. There are many yt videos on Claude Code - I’m sure there’s one that answers your question better than I can.\n\nYou could also just clone the repo and try it on the cheaper plan and see for yourself how Claude handles that. In case those 20 bucks don’t hurt you..",

I pay for the $60 plan and can get about a week of work out of it with Opus 4.5 (and that is being generous). Some times I can only go 2 days without going over the limit. It just depends on the work. Then in order to get more done, you pay more and more. I’ve spent upwards of $200-300 in a month. Compare that to Claude Code where I could spend $100 and virtually never hit the limit. I still prefer the Cursor experience these days, but it may be worth looking elsewhere.\n\nEdit: it’s important to keep in mind this example is leveraging the Opus 4.5 exclusively. I prefer to work with this model because it works so well. You can get enormously more usage using other models.\n\nEdit: Addressing your comment about Opus flailing on your project, I feel there may be an issue with your workflow. Start new chats as often as possible, be clear and provide context. Starting fresh is almost always better than trying to dig yourself out of a hole.",

Including full automatic deployment script and nightly backup and a full project documentation — took about two weeks of like 2-4 hours work each day, and I am pretty happy with the result. I‘ve limited the agent to Gemini-Flash-3 and it could deal with all issues easily, fulfilled all my special UI requests neatly and even made some great suggestions on some additional polishing (and I am still a bit flashed by the general oversight of the agent, thinking of three other places to adapt things that I only looked at in one specific area…). \nUsage costs so far is like 60€ (which I think is a joke given the work that went into it, the amount of code that was produced and the final functionality being delivered), so 40€ beyond the Pro limit, but I didn‘t quite understand the dashboard, because so far all is displayed as „included“ and my on-demand budget is still untouched…",

Frequently struggling to fix tests, looking for excuses to dismiss failing tests, etc. On UI it always tries to write a custom code, resulting in tons of duplication and inconsistency across pages. I have added cursor rules to use a specific ui kit and write it in my prompts too, and it still manages to write custom garbage code.\nMy struggle is it sometimes does a heavy lifting in just a couple of hours on a new big functionality and then it takes way more time fine tuning the edges.\nI guess if I was working on a paid project I would still use it, but can’t decide whether I want to spend 100s of $ for using it on a side project",

Ok-ish deal.\n* use auto mode: only works if you are very pain tolerant or don't have a lot of prompt complexity\n* pay-as-you-go: you set a limit, then Cursor charges you. Probably the worst deal since you don't get any \"free\" tokens, but can be tolerable for low limits.\n* use Claude code cli: $20 / month for regular usage of Claude models (sonnet, opus). Good deal if you need more access to the strongest models. Resets every 5h with a weekly limit. Claude cli is an extension to cursor that integrates reasonably well.\n* antigravity: $20/month for a separate IDE. Google's AI solution with access to Gemini and a small Claude code contingent. Good solution if you don't mind a second IDE and can deal with Gemini. Bonus: paid Gemini access on web/app -- which is probably better than chatgpt, so it's a reasonable all-around extra solution.

      "text": "I've been using 5.2 Codex this past week, and I gotta say, I'm impressed. At $14 per M output, it slots quite nicely between Opus @ $25 and Sonnet @ $15 (I'm using API keys).\n\nI find Codex is great as an all-rounder, can handle planning and coding and one surprising thing is it pushes back quite a lot on user prompt assumptions. I'm relying less on Opus and saving a lot. Sure Codex and Sonnet are still expensive, but all my expense is on company dime anyways, but I still like to keep expenses down just for ROIs sake.\n\nI recommend if you're using Opus a lot, or even Sonnet, give Codex a try. Btw, I hated GPT 5.2 as it needed much more hand-holding, but Codex seems vastly different.",

      "text": "I spent some time digging into the internal config and realized Cursor actually has a pretty powerful hooks system at `~/.cursor/hooks.json`. Unlike Claude Code (which basically only lets you hook into the end of a session), Cursor gives you access to 7 different lifecycle events that fire in real-time.\n\nThe ones I’ve found most useful are `afterAgentThought` and `afterShellExecution`. By setting these up, you can pipe the context of what the agent is doing to a logging script.\n\nThe configuration is straightforward. You point it to a script that accepts JSON via `stdin`. Here’s how I have my `hooks.json` set up to capture everything:\n\nJSON\n\n    {\n      \"version\": 1,\n      \"hooks\": {\n        \"afterAgentThought\": [\n          { \"command\": \"python ~/.cursor/hooks/keywordsai_hook.py\" }\n        ],\n        \"afterShellExecution\": [\n          { \"command\": \"python ~/.cursor/hooks/keywordsai_hook.py\" }\n        ],\n        \"afterFileEdit\": [\n          { \"command\": \"python ~/.cursor/hooks/keywordsai_hook.py\" }\n        ],\n        \"afterMCPExecution\": [\n          { \"command\": \"python ~/.cursor/hooks/keywordsai_hook.py\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n    \n\nThe real benefit here is the granularity. Since it’s event-based, my dashboard shows exactly when the agent paused to think, which files it touched, and the exact output of the terminal commands it ran.\n\nI ended up with hierarchical spans that look like this in my traces:\n\n* **cursor\\_abc123** (38.9s)\n   * ├── **Thinking 1** (0.5s) - \"Let me analyze the code...\"\n   * ├── **Edit:** **utils.py** (0.1s)\n   * ├── **Shell: npm test** (4.1s)\n   * └── **Thinking 3** (0.2s) - \"Tests passed\"\n\nIf you're building complex features where you need an audit trail of what the AI did to your code, this is the way to do it. It’s way better than just scrolling back through the chat history.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bbxcy4pj8edg1.png?width=2292&format=png&auto=webp&s=d020b3e3f02b59aa6f7d5dd561808b7eb9333dae\n\n",

Never run high-reasoning models without planning as Gemini would loops and GPT-5 series would rushes bad solutions.\n\n**If you want to skip planning / steer yourself / set & forget:** Sonnet or Composer 1 as a middle ground.

          "text": "Look into a process called Research -> Plan -> Implement. I have this workflow implemented as custom slash commands in Cursor. I built mine using ChatGPT, I imagine everyone is going to want to tune their prompts a little differently. But you want the commands to have some basic properties. Research and Plan should have guardrails to ensure they do not modify code, they just do analysis work and output a markdown file capturing that analysis. Research and Plan should also be told to \"do a deep analysis\" because otherwise the agent will often do a very surface level analysis that is incomplete or inaccurate. All custom commands should have some general guidance that reinforces things like following cursor rules or the agent files.\n\nThe Research command is all about establishing ground truth. What is the current state of the repository in relation to your requirements, what files are relevant to your requirements, are the requirements partially implemented, are there any blockers to implementing your requirements, etc. This command can be useful to establishing your baseline context before implementing a task but it's also useful for auditing your implementation after the fact (like, was the task fully implemented and are there any quality issues?). This will output a research markdown file capturing all of its findings.\n\nI will very frequently run the Research command AFTER implementation with a prompt to verify that the task was fully implemented and to verify that code written follows best practices, agent rules, etc. If it finds any gaps in the implementation I'll just create a plan to close the gaps. This loop makes it far more feasible to complete complex tasks because your essentially using multiple iterations to drift correct.\n\nThe Plan command pretty much works like the built in plan command, but it can be useful to roll your own so you can make it more rigorous both in how deep it analyzes the requirements and how detailed the final plan is.\n\nIt's also useful to have the Research and Plan commands capture a snapshot of the requirements in their output so subsequent steps have that context available to them.\n\nThe Implement command is also similar to just running the prompt in agent mode but again, defining it as a custom command let's you reinforce guardrails (must follow agent rules, must make small targeted edits, must lint and test all changes, etc.) Some people like to have the Implement command output an implementation summary markdown file, I personally prefer to have it output the summary in the chat. Also, I recommend putting guidance in the Implement command to have it stop and ask for clarification if any of the requirements are incomplete or ambiguous, this will also save a lot of headaches and can prevent drift.\n\nWhen your executing a task you would do something like:\n\n\\- /research <your prompt with your requirements>\n\n\\- /plan <the research markdown file produced in the previous step>\n\n\\- /implement <the plan markdown file produced in the previous step>\n\nFor smaller tasks you can often skip the Research step, but at least doing the Plan step will save a lot wasted time and credits. One of the key things that the Research and Plan markdown files give you is a chance to review what the agent is going to do before it tries to implement the changes. I have my custom commands include open questions if anything is unclear, and I'll usually spend a few minutes dialing in the markdown file before I move on to the next step. If your Research is dialed in you have a much higher chance of producing a solid plan and if you produce a solid plan you have a much higher change of actually implementing it.\n\nThe other big thing that outputting these markdown files give you is context that you can include in a new chat which I think is critical for context management. I'll typically run Research and Plan in a single chat but I almost always run Implement in a new chat because the agents can really suck after you've used more than like 50% of the context. I have the commands put my markdown files in a tmp/ directory in the workspace which I .gitignore.\n\nFrom my experience, this has sped up my workflow because I don't have to do rework nearly as often and has actually reduced credit use. It also lets me rely on auto mode for most tasks. People throwing Opus at everything probably just have workflow issues. I think a big part of why it reduces credit use is that running a prompt without the research or plan artifacts means the agent has to establish context like where files are and it's super inefficient at this. Front-loading that analysis mean the Implement command knows where it's supposed to be working and it can focus it's effort on actually writing code rather than building that baseline context.\n\nThere are tons of ways to make your actual coding more efficient which are very stack dependent, but I think establishing a solid workflow is the first step in really making efficient use of Cursor. Also, if you create these custom commands and you see behavior you don't like, you can always just tune the command. If I run into issues with one of my commands I copy it to ChatGPT, explain what it's doing wrong, what I would like it to do, and ask ChatGPT to revise my command to fix the issue. Then I copy the updated command back into Cursor and get back to work.",

There is claude pro which gives you more opus prompts, there is antigravity which gives you more opus prompts...

However, the recent aggressive update cycle is prioritizing \"new features\" over stability, and my team is losing trust.\n\n# 1. The Bug: Data Loss in Plan Mode\n\n**Warning to others:** Be careful with the Markdown/Preview toggle in the new Plan Mode.\n\nI spent the last two days planning a complex feature. This morning, I simply toggled the view from **Markdown -> Preview -> Markdown**. The window hanged and when I reopened the markdown was gone.\n\n* **The Result:** All of my descriptive markdown text disappeared.\n* **What was left:** Only the specific TODO items remained.\n* **Impact:** I lost the entire logic and context for the feature (2 days of work).\n\n# 2. General Feedback: The \"Silent\" Feature Churn\n\nI checked the changelog, and while it highlights new agentic features, it fails to document **breaking changes** to existing workflows.\n\n* Features are added/removed without reasoning (similar to the confusion when \"Custom Modes\" were changed/removed in v2.1).\n* UI elements shift without documentation.\n* Workflows that have been stable for months suddenly break.\n\n**To the Cursor Team:** We want to use this tool. We pay for this tool. But you are **risking losing trust from teams that pay thousands of dollars a month** by pushing updates that delete data or break workflows without warning. We need a \"Stable\" release channel or a changelog that actually explains *removals*, not just new features.\n\n**TL;DR:** Plan mode deleted my plan when toggling preview (lost 2 days of work), and the lack of transparency regarding breaking changes is becoming significantly irksome.",

Cursor not only created the markdown, but 3 other markdowns on how to deploy it, one on how to update it, one how how it was designed, and finally one how to use it (the only one I asked for). Same prompt to Claude and I got a single output, as expected. It’s too eager and does way more than what’s in the session instructions.",
