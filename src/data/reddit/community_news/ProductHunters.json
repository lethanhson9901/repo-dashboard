You can even upload your own knowledge base, customize everything, and shape the book exactly how you want it.  \n  \nIf this sounds interesting, I'd be incredibly grateful if you could check it out and support our launch.  \n  \nProduct Hunt link:  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/aivolut-books](https://www.producthunt.com/products/aivolut-books)  \n  \nAnd if you're launching something soon too (Product Hunt or anywhere else), DM me or drop your link - more than happy to support you back.  \n  \nThank you all so much",

You will be able to learn from their launches and see the strategies that work.\n* Try monitoring other people launches and be active there - support, engage, message. Also you can ask for a favour if they would be ready to support you. If yes, grab their contact, put it in the excel and save for later.",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’ve spent the last two months trying to grow on X(twitter) and use it to promote my product.\n\nHere’s a recap of what I did, what works, and what doesn’t:\n\n• **0 Followers SETUP:** If you're starting out with 0 followers and even if you write the best piece of content out there you'll not get any results. Here's what to **do first:**\n\n1. **Buy X premium (ASAP)**, it's just 8 bucks and not only X boosts your replies with it but people trust you more so they follow and engage.\n2. Pick a mission: Pick some cool mission (like i picked growing [my app](https://brandled.app/) from 0→$1k mrr)> this will create a good storyline for your content and will make people remember you\n3. Optimize your profile: Add a good headshot, good banner (not like linkedin), bio that shows your mission and progress and a pinned tweet that showcases what you're building\n\n• **Replies Strategy:** Initially your posts won't work so you need to be a reply guy in order to grow. Here's how to be one:\n\nWhat you need to do is pick 40-50 creators in your niche (<5000 followers) and add them to a list on X itself and regularly engage with their posts, not \"Good Post\" and \"best of luck\" replies but replies that adds some value, they should be either funny, controversial or value adding.\n\n• **Content Strategy:** If you have a small account, then pick a big X community like you can pick buildinpublic if you're in SaaS and just post in that instead of posting to everyone. You should be posting 3-5 times per day.\n\n• **Writing Good Posts:** Here's the checklist you should follow for writing good posts:  \n\\- Show your FACE 🚨  \n\\- Never text-only posts (image + video 📸)  \n\\- Post between 9am - 5pm EST -  \n\\- Write short sentences (no long paragraphs!)\n\n• **REPLY to everyone who engages with your posts.**\n\n• **How to get users:** Document your journey of building your product, showcase its features in a cool way, that's how you'll be getting the inbound. Pro tip: warm DM the people who regularly engage with your posts and invite them to try out your product.\n\n**What Don't Work:**  \n\\> Posting one-liners and \"let's connect\" tweets, yes they can get you followers but they won't engage with your future posts which will make your account die as X algo first push your posts to the followers and then to rest of the people\n\n\\> Cold DMS; Don't ever try it.\n\nOne more pro tip: When a tweet used to get some traction, I used add a reply with link of [my product](https://brandled.app/), this way I was able to turn that traffic into visitors.\n\nThere you have it, nothing fancy, nothing controversial. This strategy got me 50k+ impressions in my first month.\n\nI’d love to hear if you’ve tried something similar or if you have other tips for X.",

      "text": "First UP, I didn't went from idea to $1300 in 28 days.\n\nFor the first three months I didn't knew that you have to market your product too.\n\nI just kept building.\n\nThen when I had 0 users after having a brutally failed PH launch.\n\nI just went down on researching on how apps really grow from \"0\"\n\nWatched endless starter story videos, reddit threads, podcasts, articles and what not.\n\nThen finally formulated a marketing strategy and went all in on it since 1st January.\n\nIt's been a month now since going all in on [my SaaS](https://brandled.app/) and I now have 35 paying users or about $1.3k in MRR\n\nIt's not millions but atleast a proof that my stuff is working.\n\nNow here's what worked:\n\n1. **Building in public to get initial traction:** I got my first users by posting on X (build in public and startup communities). I would post my wins, updates, lessons learned, and the occasional meme. In the beginning you only need a few users and every post/reply gives you a chance to reach someone.\n2. **Warm DMs:** Nope I didn't blasted thousands of cold dms and messages instead I engaged with my ICPs posts and content and then warm dm them asking them to try out my product and give me some feedback (this was the biggest growth lever)\n3. **Word of mouth:** I always spend most of my time improving the product. My goal is to surprise users with how good the product is, and that naturally leads to them recommending the product to their friends. More than 1/3 of my paying customers come from word of mouth.\n4. **SEO:** I went into SEO from day 1, not targeting broad keywords and instead focussed on Bottom of Funnel keywords (alternatives pages, reviews pages, comparision pages), it basically allows you to steal traffic from your competitors\n5. **Removing all formatting from my emails:** I thought emails that use company branding felt impersonal and that must impact how many people actually read them. After removing all formatting from my emails my open rate almost doubled. Huge win.\n\n**What didn’t work:**\n\n**1. Building free tools:** The tools that received most traffic are usually pretty generic (posts downloader, video extractor etc.) so the audience is pretty cold and it's almost impossible to convert them\n\n**2. Affiliate system:** I’ve had an affiliate system live for months now and I get a ton of applications but it’s extremely rare that an affiliate will actually follow through on their plans. 99% get 0 sign ups.\n\n**3. Building features no one wants (obviously):** I’ve wasted a few weeks here and there when I built out features that no one really wanted. I strongly recommend you to talk to your users and really try to understand them before building out new features.\n\nNext steps:\n\nDoing more of what works. I’m not going to try any new marketing channels until I’m doing my current ones really well. And I will continue spending most of my time improving product (can’t stress how important this has been).\n\nAlso working on a big update but won’t talk about that yet.\n\nBest of luck founders!",

People underestimate how much a plain-text email feels like a real conversatin rather than a marketing blast. Also, 'stealing' competitor traffic via BoFu keywords (alternatives pages) is a top-tier move for a 28-day sprint.\n\ndon't sweat the PH launch - most of us have ben there.It’s the consistent daily distribution that builds the empire.

My recent experience with Product Hunt.  \nSo - if you are an early stage founder - should you \\[not\\]launch on Product Hunt?   \nIt depends.  \nNot on your product.  \nOn your goal.  \n  \nAfter launching [modaal.dev](http://modaal.dev) \\[ business grade ios apps on Swift with AI\\] -  this week, my conclusion is simple:  \nProduct Hunt is mostly a re-engagement engine - not a discovery engine.  \n  \n1) If your goal is re-engagement → launch.  \nPH is great when you already have:  \nan audience  \ncustomers  \na network  \nBecause the real PH loop is:  \nYou ship → you email / post / DM → your people show up → they engage → you re-activate the market around you.  \nSo yes — if you’re Miro / Mistral AI / Vercel / Webflow **-**level, Product Hunt is perfect. \\[that's exactly who played yesterday\\]  \n  \n2) If your goal is new users → usually don’t overinvest.  \nIf you want fresh leads or new early adopters, PH is often a weak time → outcome bet.  \nUnless you’re a very broad product that “anyone wish/can try fast”.   \nExample: whispeflow  \n  \n3) The evolution of Product Hunt nobody likes to say out loud  \nI’ve been watching PH for \\~7 years.  \nIt evolved from:  \nindie makers shipping MVPs  \ninto:  \nbig companies shipping features  \nAnd that’s fine.  \nIt’s just a different game now.  \nBut if your goal is: “I want the world’s early adopters to discover me”…  \nPH is no longer the best place to bet your time.  \n  \n4) The uncomfortable reality about ranking  \nWant #1?  \nOn average you need 300–600 upvotes for this.  \nBig companies can do it with their built-in reach.  \nSmall teams have 2 options:  \n\\* accept a realistic rank (still valuable)  \nor \\* pay (and that usually means low-quality voting)  \nYes, vote services is service.  \nMarket reality: 300–500 votes can cost \\~$3–5k.  \nIt may buy you a good screenshot. It rarely buys you users.  \n  \n5) My launch results (and why I’m happy)  \nI sent \\~600 personal messages.  \nWe got 218 votes.  \nWe got 5 very interesting VC/Angel convos leads.  \nAnd I call it a success.  \nBecause my goal wasn’t installs or #1.  \n  \nMy goal was:  \nawareness inside my circle + credibility in the exact communities where my product belongs. For that → PH worked. For me.  \n  \nMy wish  \nI hope vibecoding tools like Lovable / Bolt / v0 by Vercel Base44 create a new “maker arena” again — a place where brand-new products can be showcased and get first adopters without competing with enterprise feature drops.  \n",

We are launching **Supaboard AI** on Product Hunt today, and when I opened the leaderboard this morning I genuinely laughed: we’re basically “competing” for attention on the same day / feed as **Vercel, GitHub, and Webflow**.\n\nObviously we’re not pretending we’re that size — but it’s a pretty wild reminder of what Product Hunt is: one page where a tiny product can show up beside giants, and you still get a shot at being noticed if your story and value are clear.\n\nSince most people here launch on PH (or want to), I thought of sharing my two cents of what we are doing that is helping us get moving:\n\n* **Tight one-liner > long pitch.** We rewrote our tagline to be instantly understandable to someone who is scrolling through.\n* **Ask for feedback, not “upvotes.”** People are way more willing to help when you’re genuinely asking “what’s unclear?”\n* **Have a “comment plan.”** Engagement in the comment section, matters more than people think. That's why, we had everyone in the office reply fast to every question/comment.\n* **DMs > mass posting.** The best support came from personal messages to builders who’ve launched before (and we offered to return the favor on their day).\n\nIf you’re open to helping: I’d love honest feedback on the PH page (what’s confusing / what would make you bounce). And if you think it’s worthy, an upvote really helps us survive the “Vercel/GitHub/Webflow” gravity today.\n\nPH Link: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/supaboard-ai](https://www.producthunt.com/products/supaboard-ai)\n\nAlso — if you’re launching soon, drop your link and your launch date. I’ll support you on your day, and if you want, I can share the exact outreach/comment checklist we used. 🙌",

I’ve seen too many stories like \"raised $700K pre-seed → burned through it → now stressed out trying to raise again.\" Meanwhile, I just fix bugs, ship small features, talk to customers and grow at my own pace.\n\nWith micro SaaS, you can get to $5K–$20K MRR with high margins, no pressure and total control over your time. You don’t need a team of 20 or a slide deck for every decision. Just a useful product, a few customers who pay and a feedback loop that actually works.\n\nWould love to hear from others building solo or small- how’s it going for you?

It's so much less pressure and stress when are bootstrapping as that means you have full autonomy over what you do and you are working according to your time frame. It's actually a bit of a vibe really. Knowing that you can technically stop whenever and still have cash coming in. The problem is when you raise early, that's a lot of pressure for zero to non-existent traction. I feel like it's bullshit for anyone that says they found pmf pre-seed or seed or that they achieved $1M ARR in X months. It's kind of the saying from 20VC podcast where it's not about how quick you get to your first  1 or 5 million arr but the time it takes to go from 0 to 50. That's where you can say you found pmf. So coming back to the point is I would agree that $10K MRR feels much better than $2m seed because it's 100% your cash, working for yourself, and no vc's pressuring you. That's just my take at least.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just launched Ghostframe on Product Hunt and would really appreciate the feedback\n\n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/ghostframe](https://www.producthunt.com/products/ghostframe)\n\nI had hundreds bookmarked tweets. I used exactly zero of them to write anything.\n\nThe problem wasn't finding good content — it was actually turning it into something I could publish without starting from scratch every time.\n\nSo I built a small Chrome extension for myself.\n\nIt's a Chrome extension that works directly inside Twitter. You save tweets or full threads with one click, it captures the engagement metrics (views, likes, RTs), and organizes everything into lists.\n\nThen you can:\n\n* **Generate new tweets or threads with AI** — based on the viral posts you saved.\n* **Export everything to Markdown** if you want to use it elsewhere.\n* **Build a personal library** of what actually works in your niche.\n\nIt's not a scheduler. It's not a generic AI writer. It's a way to turn the content you already consume into content you can publish.\n\nJust launched it on Product Hunt today: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/ghostframe](https://www.producthunt.com/products/ghostframe)\n\nIf you write on Twitter and you're tired of the blank page problem, I'd appreciate you checking it out.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

          "text": "The key for this to be addictive is making “save → remix → post” a single flow, not three separate chores. Right now it sounds great for capture, but I’d push harder on what happens after you generate: can I instantly create a thread variant, a short for LinkedIn, or a draft for my newsletter from the same base tweet, and see which angle I’ve already used so I don’t repeat myself? \n\n\n\nAlso, I’d give power users more control over how “inspired by” vs “derivative” the AI is: sliders for structure vs wording, plus a way to lock in certain phrases so my voice survives. A simple “idea inbox” view with filters by niche + engagement bands (e.g., 1–10k likes, 10–100k) would help pick the right source for the right day. \n\n\n\nOn the research side, I bounce between Typefully and Hypefury, and use Pulse for Reddit mostly to mine real questions and language that I then mirror in Twitter hooks, so a tight capture/remix loop like this really matters.",
