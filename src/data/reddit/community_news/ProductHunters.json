Getting to 42 users early shows there’s real curiosity around the problem.\n\nIf you want to scale before charging, I’d suggest narrowing to one sharp ICP first (e.g., early-stage SaaS founders doing sales calls weekly) and crafting messaging around one painful use case like “never miss competitor pricing or feature changes again.” That clarity will convert better than broad monitoring claims.\n\nFrom a product perspective, how are you surfacing insights raw change logs, summaries, or actionable alerts so users feel daily value instead of just passive tracking?",

We built something extremely demoable. If people understand it in 10 seconds, it spreads.\n2. Tight positioning. Not “another AI app.” Clear outcome: Speak → It does the work.\n3. Clean launch page. Short copy. Clear value. One core message.\n4. We activated our immediate network manually. Personal DMs. Not spam. Real conversations.\n5. We stayed online the entire launch window. Responded to every comment fast.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nNo hacks.  \nNo growth tricks.  \nJust usefulness + focus on launch day.\n\nHappy to share exact learnings if helpful.",

Every time something failed, I told myself \"one more try.\" That \"one more try\" happened 7+ times.\n\nFor this one, I sold my personal stuff to fund it. No investor, no safety net. Just me, alone, building something I kept feeling nobody had built right yet.\n\nHere's what kept bugging me - every creator and business sends traffic to their link-in-bio page. Thousands of visitors land there. And what do they see? Dead links sitting in a list. No story, no emotion, no reason to care. That traffic just... leaks.\n\nSo I built CroozLink. An AI that takes your links and weaves them into a story - it gives every link context, emotion, a reason to click. Your page stops being a parking lot and starts being an experience.\n\nAnd then I built Crooz Radar - think of it like live Q&A where your audience asks you questions in real-time. No algorithm filtering who sees what. But here's the part that excites me most - every question, every interaction becomes a source of organic traffic. People search those topics, they find your page. Your audience grows while you sleep.\n\nLess than 4 hours to go. I keep checking the clock every 2 minutes like it's gonna change something.\n\nIf you've ever poured everything into something and watched the clock before the world sees it - you know this feeling. Here is the PH Link if you want to support :- [https://www.producthunt.com/products/croozlink?launch=croozlink](https://www.producthunt.com/products/croozlink?launch=croozlink)\n\nAnd if it flops?

Google Drive means opening a browser, uploading, fiddling with permissions, sharing the link and now there's a file sitting in my Drive that I'll use once and never think about again. WeTransfer wants email confirmations and it's just a whole thing.\n\nWe got tired of it honestly. Sharing a file should be fast and simple. So we made FileNotch. You drag a file to your MacBook's notch and boom, shareable link. Done. The other person just clicks and downloads, no account needed.\n\nWe added file encryption, password protection, email gating, download tracking, the baic stuff you'd want and need. And files auto-delete after a set period so you're not hoarding random stuff in the cloud forever.\n\nThere's a free version if you wanna check it out would appreciate some ProductHunt upvotes: [https://apps.apple.com/it/app/filenotch-transfer-files/id6758035666?mt=12](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/filenotch-transfer-files/id6758035666?mt=12)\n\n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/filenotch?utm\\_source=other&utm\\_medium=social](https://www.producthunt.com/products/filenotch?utm_source=other&utm_medium=social)\n\nWould love to hear what you think!",

We launched last week officially and running a PH launch tomorrow. \n\nI'll be honest, I've never done this before and need some advice.\n\nThis will be my first real launch outside of my own network.\n\nWhat I’ve done so far:\n\n* Built an email list of \\~640 people (mostly from cold outreach + waitlist)\n* Prepped VSLs\n* Reaching out to founders for early support\n* Planning to launch on a Tuesday (heard that’s optimal?)\n* No paid ads\n\nWhat I *haven’t* figured out:\n\n* Is it worth “warming up” hunters or just post myself?\n* How aggressive should I be with outreach on launch day?\n* Does being #1 even matter? Surely just not being at the bottom?\n* How much traffic typically converts from PH in 2026?\n\nI’m not expecting magic.\n\nBut I also don’t want to waste the spike if there’s a smarter way to handle it.\n\nWould really value your input and don't mind the harsh criticism. \n\nIf youve run a launch before, what actually made a difference?\n\nAnd what turned out to be a complete waste of time?\n\n  \nThank you :)\n\n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/myautobot-ai](https://www.producthunt.com/products/myautobot-ai)\n\n",

Ask for comments, for opinions, for help.\nA thoughtful comment + discussion signals helps ranking more than silent upvotes.\n\n3. Post it yourself.\nHunters don’t move the needle anymore.\nYour energy and responsiveness matter more. Don’t do anything else on that day. \n\n4. Be hyper-present in the comments.\nReply fast. Be detailed. Treat it like a live sales call for 24 hours.\n\n5. #1 matters for vanity. Top 5 matters for distribution.\n\noptimize for email capture + demo bookings, not leaderboard position. Unless you choose vanity against sales.\n\n6. \nDon’t expect miracles.\n\n\n\nProduct Hunt isn’t a growth engine.\nIt’s a leverage event.\n\nThink about using second tier platforms, too.",

Just trying to understand what realistically moves the needle now.\n\nIf you’ve launched before:\n\n* What worked unexpectedly well?\n* What didn’t matter as much as you thought?\n* Anything you’d do differently?\n\nAppreciate any real experiences.

Also, the algorithm heavily favors active discussions. You need to be glued to your screen on launch day responding to absolutely every single comment and question within minutes. Good luck!",

That activity signals relevance far more than passive votes spread across the day.\n\nAlso worth planning for the mid-day drop. Many launches spike early then stall because outreach stops. The teams that keep momentum going with follow-ups, new audiences, and updates tend to climb while others fade.\n\nThis launch-day timeline breaks down those phases hour-by-hour if you want something practical to follow:  \n[https://uprowshub.com/campaigns/blog/product-hunt-launch-day-timeline](https://uprowshub.com/campaigns/blog/product-hunt-launch-day-timeline)\n\nDefinitely doable with prep.

From 350 anonymized scans:\n\n* 62% fire tracking before consent\n* 7% lose Google Ads conversions due to consent issues\n* 14% have critical failures\n\nJust added $9/mo monitoring (weekly rescans + alerts) because sites keep re-breaking after updates.\n\nStill very early, first paid report ($19 detailed fixes) came in last week after a month of Reddit/HN posts. Solo project, no funding, just trying to solve a pain I kept seeing in Ads attribution.\n\nIf you have a minute tomorrow and think it looks useful (or just want to support an indie maker), an upvote or comment would mean a lot, helps a ton with visibility on PH.\n\nNo pressure at all, and brutal feedback welcome too.\n\nLaunch link (live tomorrow): [https://www.producthunt.com/posts/consentcheck](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/consentcheck)  \nFree scan here if curious: [https://consentcheck.online](https://consentcheck.online)\n\nThanks in advance, really appreciate the community!",

      "text": "Hey r/ProductHunters, \n\nI just launched on Product Hunt and would love some support from the community.\n\nWhat's Your Attention Worth? is a free calculator that estimates how much the advertising industry has spent putting ads in front of you since you first went online. You enter your age, country, and gender and it shows your estimated lifetime ad spend based on real industry CPM rates, adjusted for your demographic, historical ad density by era, and platform mix.\n\nSome context: I work in programmatic advertising. I built this because most people have no idea how much money flows through the system to reach them. The average American has had $90,000+ spent targeting them by age 35. That number surprised even people in my own industry.\n\nWhat makes it different:\n\n* CPM rates adjusted by country and age bracket using published industry data\n* Historical ad density scaling (your 90s internet years aren't charged at 2025 rates)\n* Everything runs in your browser, your inputs never leave your device\n* No signup, no paywall, completely free\n\nIt already got featured on iHeartRadio's Rod Ryan Show and picked up 19K+ upvotes across Reddit with people sharing their numbers.\n\nWould really appreciate an upvote on Product Hunt: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/attention-worth?launch=attention-worth](https://www.producthunt.com/products/attention-worth?launch=attention-worth)\n\nHappy to answer any questions about how the ad tech math works.
