      "text": "I’m a founder of a SaaS company, which I built solo, bootstrapped, no investors. It helps founders grow their personal brand on X & LinkedIn and drive inbound. Simple tool, solves a real problem and makes money from day one.\n\nAnd honestly, the more I build, the more I believe micro SaaS > venture-backed startups. I’ve seen too many stories like \"raised $700K pre-seed → burned through it → now stressed out trying to raise again.\" Meanwhile, I just fix bugs, ship small features, talk to customers and grow at my own pace.\n\nWith micro SaaS, you can get to $5K–$20K MRR with high margins, no pressure and total control over your time. You don’t need a team of 20 or a slide deck for every decision. Just a useful product, a few customers who pay and a feedback loop that actually works.\n\nWould love to hear from others building solo or small- how’s it going for you? And if you’re still debating startup vs micro SaaS, happy to share more behind the scenes if helpful",

          "text": "I personally think it depends on traction and also why I would go against raising pre-seed or seed unless it's absolute necessary. It's so much less pressure and stress when are bootstrapping as that means you have full autonomy over what you do and you are working according to your time frame. It's actually a bit of a vibe really. Knowing that you can technically stop whenever and still have cash coming in. The problem is when you raise early, that's a lot of pressure for zero to non-existent traction. I feel like it's bullshit for anyone that says they found pmf pre-seed or seed or that they achieved $1M ARR in X months. It's kind of the saying from 20VC podcast where it's not about how quick you get to your first  1 or 5 million arr but the time it takes to go from 0 to 50. That's where you can say you found pmf. So coming back to the point is I would agree that $10K MRR feels much better than $2m seed because it's 100% your cash, working for yourself, and no vc's pressuring you. That's just my take at least.",

We wanted something *different* — something that really understands the lived experience of chronic illness. So we built Juno: an AI clinical specialist you can talk to daily about symptoms, sleep, medications and more — and she automatically tracks everything and spots connections you might miss.\n\n🔹 Built on real research: 1,000+ patient interviews and Oxford-level insights  \n🔹 Meaningful tracking: Juno links patterns over time (e.g., new meds → symptoms)  \n🔹 Actionable insights: Users have used her insights to get earlier diagnoses  \n🔹 Loved by users: 20k+ downloads, 400+ 5-star reviews in 3 months\n\nWe’re launching on Product Hunt today — and would *really* appreciate your support. If you or someone you know lives with a chronic condition (or cares for someone who does), Juno is designed for you.\n\n👇 Upvote and share your thoughts here:  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/juno-13?launch=juno-12](https://www.producthunt.com/products/juno-13?launch=juno-12&utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

You will be able to learn from their launches and see the strategies that work.\n* Try monitoring other people launches and be active there - support, engage, message. Also you can ask for a favour if they would be ready to support you. If yes, grab their contact, put it in the excel and save for later.",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’ve spent the last two months trying to grow on X(twitter) and use it to promote my product.\n\nHere’s a recap of what I did, what works, and what doesn’t:\n\n• **0 Followers SETUP:** If you're starting out with 0 followers and even if you write the best piece of content out there you'll not get any results. Here's what to **do first:**\n\n1. **Buy X premium (ASAP)**, it's just 8 bucks and not only X boosts your replies with it but people trust you more so they follow and engage.\n2. Pick a mission: Pick some cool mission (like i picked growing [my app](https://brandled.app/) from 0→$1k mrr)> this will create a good storyline for your content and will make people remember you\n3. Optimize your profile: Add a good headshot, good banner (not like linkedin), bio that shows your mission and progress and a pinned tweet that showcases what you're building\n\n• **Replies Strategy:** Initially your posts won't work so you need to be a reply guy in order to grow. Here's how to be one:\n\nWhat you need to do is pick 40-50 creators in your niche (<5000 followers) and add them to a list on X itself and regularly engage with their posts, not \"Good Post\" and \"best of luck\" replies but replies that adds some value, they should be either funny, controversial or value adding.\n\n• **Content Strategy:** If you have a small account, then pick a big X community like you can pick buildinpublic if you're in SaaS and just post in that instead of posting to everyone. You should be posting 3-5 times per day.\n\n• **Writing Good Posts:** Here's the checklist you should follow for writing good posts:  \n\\- Show your FACE 🚨  \n\\- Never text-only posts (image + video 📸)  \n\\- Post between 9am - 5pm EST -  \n\\- Write short sentences (no long paragraphs!)\n\n• **REPLY to everyone who engages with your posts.**\n\n• **How to get users:** Document your journey of building your product, showcase its features in a cool way, that's how you'll be getting the inbound. Pro tip: warm DM the people who regularly engage with your posts and invite them to try out your product.\n\n**What Don't Work:**  \n\\> Posting one-liners and \"let's connect\" tweets, yes they can get you followers but they won't engage with your future posts which will make your account die as X algo first push your posts to the followers and then to rest of the people\n\n\\> Cold DMS; Don't ever try it.\n\nOne more pro tip: When a tweet used to get some traction, I used add a reply with link of [my product](https://brandled.app/), this way I was able to turn that traffic into visitors.\n\nThere you have it, nothing fancy, nothing controversial. This strategy got me 50k+ impressions in my first month.\n\nI’d love to hear if you’ve tried something similar or if you have other tips for X.",

Just launched [NewCV.ai](http://NewCV.ai) on Product Hunt today. 🤞🏼\n\n  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/newcv-ai](https://www.producthunt.com/products/newcv-ai)\n\n  \nIt’s an AI tool that turns any job link into a tailored, ATS-ready CV + cover letter.\n\n\n\nWould genuinely appreciate any feedback from this community — especially around positioning or clarity.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions here too. 🥹\n\n",

I myself rarely visit the site to see what's in the top 5/10, and even then I often see the same \"TODO\" application remade with AI.\nMost of the products at the top of the list are not even worth your attention or time. Once, out of curiosity, I looked at more products, about 100 of them, and most of them are either clones that are the same but think they are different, or AI slop made over the weekend and released on Product Hunt to make a quick buck.\nIf you want users, you definitely won't get them on ProductHunt.\n\nBesides, anyone who sees ads on ProductHunt can see them, but I don't even see the promoted ones, and it's very clear.",

The real magic happens when you're actually *doing* it and having to think on your feet.  \n\nFor my own prep, I've been using The Product Sandbox ([https://sandbox4pm.com/pm-interview](https://sandbox4pm.com/pm-interview)) for simulating those high-stakes scenarios. It's been super helpful for building those decision-making muscles before an actual interview. The AI feedback is pretty insightful too, it's helped me spot some blind spots I didn't even know I had. Curious to see how AI tools evolve in this space!",
