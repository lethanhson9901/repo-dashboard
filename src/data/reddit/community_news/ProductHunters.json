We wanted something *different* — something that really understands the lived experience of chronic illness. So we built Juno: an AI clinical specialist you can talk to daily about symptoms, sleep, medications and more — and she automatically tracks everything and spots connections you might miss.\n\n🔹 Built on real research: 1,000+ patient interviews and Oxford-level insights  \n🔹 Meaningful tracking: Juno links patterns over time (e.g., new meds → symptoms)  \n🔹 Actionable insights: Users have used her insights to get earlier diagnoses  \n🔹 Loved by users: 20k+ downloads, 400+ 5-star reviews in 3 months\n\nWe’re launching on Product Hunt today — and would *really* appreciate your support. If you or someone you know lives with a chronic condition (or cares for someone who does), Juno is designed for you.\n\n👇 Upvote and share your thoughts here:  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/juno-13?launch=juno-12](https://www.producthunt.com/products/juno-13?launch=juno-12&utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

Besides, there aren't many users on this portal, mainly solo makers/team makers just to gain some SEO. No normal person wastes time checking the daily list of applications. I myself rarely visit the site to see what's in the top 5/10, and even then I often see the same \"TODO\" application remade with AI.\nMost of the products at the top of the list are not even worth your attention or time. Once, out of curiosity, I looked at more products, about 100 of them, and most of them are either clones that are the same but think they are different, or AI slop made over the weekend and released on Product Hunt to make a quick buck.\nIf you want users, you definitely won't get them on ProductHunt.\n\nBesides, anyone who sees ads on ProductHunt can see them, but I don't even see the promoted ones, and it's very clear.",

It's been super helpful for building those decision-making muscles before an actual interview. The AI feedback is pretty insightful too, it's helped me spot some blind spots I didn't even know I had.

This is the first kids app, that is really thought through with a high focus on privacy and keeping the kids away from direct contact to AI.\n\nI‘d really love your support!

Literally chatting. You can log expenses naturally as you spend, or dump everything later in the day. It organizes them into categories with budgets, and then you can ask real questions — like where you’re paying more for the same items, how prices changed over time, or which categories spike on weekends.\n\nNo apps. No spreadsheets. No signup.  \nJust ask Costman about your money and get clarity when you need it.\n\nIf you want to support, you can do it here: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/costman/launches](https://www.producthunt.com/products/costman/launches)",
