So I would focus on validating before developing however you can, I got lucky and found a service that works for me cuz I'm purely SaaS and so now I'm to the point where I can confirm I'll have users/customers before I start developing.

You can even upload your own knowledge base, customize everything, and shape the book exactly how you want it.  \n  \nIf this sounds interesting, I'd be incredibly grateful if you could check it out and support our launch.  \n  \nProduct Hunt link:  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/aivolut-books](https://www.producthunt.com/products/aivolut-books)  \n  \nAnd if you're launching something soon too (Product Hunt or anywhere else), DM me or drop your link - more than happy to support you back.  \n  \nThank you all so much",

It would genuinely mean the world to us 🙏\n\nWe are currently live and fighting our way up the rankings.\n\n👉 Product Hunt launch link:\n\n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/kalendar-work-the-calendly-replacement?launch=kalendar-work&utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_campaign=reddit\\_ph\\_posts](https://www.producthunt.com/products/kalendar-work-the-calendly-replacement?launch=kalendar-work&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=reddit_ph_posts)\n\nAnd if you are launching this week, happy to return the favor.

After I used several project management tools in my agency, I always felt there's too much more than what a small agency, business or solopreneurs need. Costly and feature overload led me to build this one.\n\n2. Vaultana, one-link end-to-end contract software which helps businesses to have secure deal by locking payment without actually debiting it from the client end. Assisted with AI for quicker dispute resolution.\n\n\nProblem. Both of these requires money and so, I am genuinely very hopeful which is exactly why I am building this slowly. Arkera is almost done while vaultana will take time. \n\nI'd seek investments or the grant to help launch, as I already have genuine demands for both. If none, I'd be glad to have your feedback and criticism.\n\n'One chance is all we need'",

I used exactly zero of them to write anything.\n\nThe problem wasn't finding good content — it was actually turning it into something I could publish without starting from scratch every time.\n\nSo I built a small Chrome extension for myself.\n\nIt's a Chrome extension that works directly inside Twitter. You save tweets or full threads with one click, it captures the engagement metrics (views, likes, RTs), and organizes everything into lists.\n\nThen you can:\n\n* **Generate new tweets or threads with AI** — based on the viral posts you saved.\n* **Export everything to Markdown** if you want to use it elsewhere.\n* **Build a personal library** of what actually works in your niche.\n\nIt's not a scheduler. It's not a generic AI writer. It's a way to turn the content you already consume into content you can publish.\n\nJust launched it on Product Hunt today: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/ghostframe](https://www.producthunt.com/products/ghostframe)\n\nIf you write on Twitter and you're tired of the blank page problem, I'd appreciate you checking it out.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

A simple “idea inbox” view with filters by niche + engagement bands (e.g., 1–10k likes, 10–100k) would help pick the right source for the right day. \n\n\n\nOn the research side, I bounce between Typefully and Hypefury, and use Pulse for Reddit mostly to mine real questions and language that I then mirror in Twitter hooks, so a tight capture/remix loop like this really matters.",

We are launching **Supaboard AI** on Product Hunt today, and when I opened the leaderboard this morning I genuinely laughed: we’re basically “competing” for attention on the same day / feed as **Vercel, GitHub, and Webflow**.\n\nObviously we’re not pretending we’re that size — but it’s a pretty wild reminder of what Product Hunt is: one page where a tiny product can show up beside giants, and you still get a shot at being noticed if your story and value are clear.\n\nSince most people here launch on PH (or want to), I thought of sharing my two cents of what we are doing that is helping us get moving:\n\n* **Tight one-liner > long pitch.** We rewrote our tagline to be instantly understandable to someone who is scrolling through.\n* **Ask for feedback, not “upvotes.”** People are way more willing to help when you’re genuinely asking “what’s unclear?”\n* **Have a “comment plan.”** Engagement in the comment section, matters more than people think. That's why, we had everyone in the office reply fast to every question/comment.\n* **DMs > mass posting.** The best support came from personal messages to builders who’ve launched before (and we offered to return the favor on their day).\n\nIf you’re open to helping: I’d love honest feedback on the PH page (what’s confusing / what would make you bounce). And if you think it’s worthy, an upvote really helps us survive the “Vercel/GitHub/Webflow” gravity today.\n\nPH Link: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/supaboard-ai](https://www.producthunt.com/products/supaboard-ai)\n\nAlso — if you’re launching soon, drop your link and your launch date.

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’ve spent the last two months promoting my project on Reddit. Went viral, got removed by moderators, and everything in between.\n\nHere’s a recap of what I did, what works, and what doesn’t:\n\n* **Launch posts (work)**: there are a ton of communities that let you showcase your product without getting banned, I made a list of subreddits with my target audience -> read the community guidelines on self-promotion -> checked if they have a dedicated flair or a designated day (usually on Saturday) -> shared my product. The first time it didn’t get any views/upvotes but I continued working on the copy until I found one that goes viral regularly. My best tips?\n   1. *Match the tone of the community*: this is what makes the difference between going viral and getting ignored (or banned).\n   2. *Subreddit size doesn’t matter that much*: people ignore smaller communities, but I had the same post go viral in a 95K subreddit and in a 9.5K one and got nearly the same visits to my project.\n   3. *Let Reddit help you*: if you’re struggling to find subreddits that match your product go to Reddit ads page -> setup your account -> click \"create campaign\" -> insert keywords related to your product and Reddit will auto suggest the most relevant subreddits.\n* **Shameless plugs (work, but probably I shouldn’t say it)**: general advice to write a comment to promote your product is something along the lines of *\"I had the same problem last year. Tried a bunch of solutions but found \\[tool\\] worked best for my use case. The key was \\[specific feature\\]. Went from \\[before state\\] to \\[after state\\] in about \\[timeframe\\]\"*. That’s a lot of work and not always needed. If your product is a direct answer to the question just share it, but make sure to disclose you’re the founder (proof: one of my shameless plugs got 25 upvotes and a couple hundred visitors to my project).\n* **“What are you building?” posts (don’t work)**: I’ve shared my project in a few “what are you building” posts. Results? Crickets. People are there to write comments, not to read the comments.\n* **Tracking conversations (works)**: I regularly track the visitors coming from reddit and their conversion rates. I don’t always have the time to leave a reply but just scrolling trought the comments helps me better understand users (I’ve already stolen a couple of ideas to improve my copy). If you have no idea about what to track, start with competitor mentions, keywords related to the problem/pain point you solve, or mentions of specific features.\n* **DMs (don’t scale)**: I’m not really a fan of DMs, Reddit is great at getting views and moving the conversation in 1vs1 won’t get you any. They only make sense when you fear your comment could be downvoted into oblivion.\n* **Content Strategy (not sure)**: I’ve shared me journey or growth experiments or just posts I thought would be interesting for my audience. (7 months of \"vibe coding\" a SaaS and here's what nobody tells you, You WILL Reach $10K MRR (If You Follow This Simple SaaS Routine),I studied 47 SaaS products that went from 0 to 10k MRR last year. Here's what they all did right),\n* for context my project is a [saas tool](https://brandled.app/) sometimes adding a link at the end or a softfer CTA inviting to check out my project. Some got a few thousand views, others were so bad that they didn’t even get AI-generated comments. However, none of them brought a significant spike in visitors (probably a skill issue on my side).\n\nThere you have it, nothing fancy, nothing controversial. This strategy got me 550k+ impressions in my first month.\n\nI’d love to hear if you’ve tried something similar or if you have other tips on marketing on Reddit.",

The advice about using Reddit to learn language and objections is huge, its basically free customer research.\n\nIm curious, did you notice any pattern in what made a post tip over into viral, like being contrarian, using numbers, or just a stronger hook?\n\nIf youre collecting examples, weve been saving a few SaaS marketing experiment notes here too: https://blog.promarkia.com/",

One Place is a group trip planning app aimed at groups of friends, couples or families that want to get more on top of upcoming holidays, trips and weddings.\n\nI am aware that PeerPush has some mixed reviews, but for me its more about building confidence and gaining some real feedback outside of friends and family. If all goes well, I would love to have a go at Product Hunt!\n\nYour help and support with this launch would mean a great deal.\n\nHere is the link: [https://peerpush.net/p/one-place-shared-events-and-group-plans](https://peerpush.net/p/one-place-shared-events-and-group-plans) \n\nThank you in advance and please let me know how I can support any of your current launches!",
