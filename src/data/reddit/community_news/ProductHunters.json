      "text": "I’ve been sitting on this for months. Kept telling myself I’d do it “when it’s ready” or “when I feel more confident”. Today I just stopped thinking and posted it on Product Hunt.\n\nResult so far: 7 upvotes, zero users.\n\nI don’t really know how I feel about it yet. Part of me is disappointed. Part of me is relieved. Mostly I just feel… less tense than I did yesterday.\n\nThis is my second company and I think the first one failing made me overthink everything this time. Launching felt like opening myself up to judgement again, which is probably why I kept delaying it.\n\nI don’t know if anything will come from this launch. It might be nothing. But at least it’s out there now, and I’m not hiding from it anymore.\n\nFor people who’ve been through this, what did you do *after* your first quiet launch day? Did you push harder, change direction, or just let it sit for a bit?\n\nNot promoting anything. Just sharing where I’m at.\n\n[Link](https://www.producthunt.com/products/inbox-party/) for anyone curious.",

It would genuinely mean the world to us 🙏\n\nWe are currently live and fighting our way up the rankings.\n\n👉 Product Hunt launch link:\n\n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/kalendar-work-the-calendly-replacement?launch=kalendar-work&utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_campaign=reddit\\_ph\\_posts](https://www.producthunt.com/products/kalendar-work-the-calendly-replacement?launch=kalendar-work&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=reddit_ph_posts)\n\nAnd if you are launching this week, happy to return the favor.

After I used several project management tools in my agency, I always felt there's too much more than what a small agency, business or solopreneurs need. Costly and feature overload led me to build this one.\n\n2. Vaultana, one-link end-to-end contract software which helps businesses to have secure deal by locking payment without actually debiting it from the client end. Assisted with AI for quicker dispute resolution.\n\n\nProblem. Both of these requires money and so, I am genuinely very hopeful which is exactly why I am building this slowly. Arkera is almost done while vaultana will take time. \n\nI'd seek investments or the grant to help launch, as I already have genuine demands for both. If none, I'd be glad to have your feedback and criticism.\n\n'One chance is all we need'",

      "text": "Kinda embarrassing to post but\n\nLast year we built this B2B tool for used car dealerships. Helps them price inventory, spot damage in trade-ins, etc. Boring enterprise software.\n\nWe're doing the whole startup thing and sent cold emails, demo calls, events. during demos and events we would always get \"hey can I just use this to check a car I'm looking at on facebook/craigslist/carmax?\" And we'd be like \"no sorry, this is for dealerships only, sorry\" and move on.\n\nThis kept happening though and we (stupidly) just kept saying no.\n\nThen in August I needed to move from California to NYC. UHaul wanted $5,300 to rent a truck. I'm broke from the startup and all I had left was like $6k, so I said I'll just buy a cheap truck and sell it when I get there.\n\nProblem was im a car guy that knows sports cars. I don't know trucks. So I just used our own product on facebook listings until I found a 2001 GMC Sierra for $5,300. Tool said the center support bearing was probably bad. I bought it anyway and drove it 3,000 miles. Bearing sounded terrible the whole time and exploded in New Mexico. Sold it in Philly for $6,800. Still made a profit moving my stuff across the country.\n\nHad a meeting with my co-founder and basically just said people keep asking for this, and it works, so should we just build it? Spent like 2 months ripping out the dealer stuff and making a consumer version. Threw up a really basic landing page. Priced it at $5 per report because that seemed reasonable. Used the truck story as the homepage because we didn't know what else to put.\n\nWe just launched on Product Hunt but, of course, no one normal looking for a car has an account there so their upvotes just vaporize. We halfassed the most important part of Product Hunt 101. Sharing this story with you so you have those PH accounts ready early.

      "text": "Hey PH community,\n\nSix months ago, we launched **v1 of Meet-Ting**.\n\nIt was an AI you could email and simply CC to manage all your meeting admin - from planning, to booking, to rescheduling.\n\nIt was *hard*. At the time, AI didn’t really live in email, and group coordination was (and still is) emerging. Most AI is in chat windows. Once you add multiple people, the room for error = painful.\n\nSince then, we’ve launched Ting across **Gmail, Outlook, Zoom, Teams, and WhatsApp**, and we recently submitted our **ChatGPT integration**.\n\nAlong the way, we realized something important: **Scheduling isn’t just admin. Time = decisions, not logistics.**\n\nHow we feel about time changes daily - energy levels, deadlines, goals, clients shouting, ambition, guilt etc.\n\nSo Ting has been building **deep memories** with each user to learn what they value + how they make decisions about time.\n\nNow it’s ready to make decisions *for* you, so you don’t have to, because you’re already too busy!\n\nWe call Ting an **availability agent**, because we see a future where you don’t send emails or booking links: you send agents. And those agents need to understand what you value first!\n\nIf this hits, I’d really appreciate your support here: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/meet-ting/launches/meet-ting-2](https://www.producthunt.com/products/meet-ting/launches/meet-ting-2)\n\nThank you,\n\nDan (co-founder)",

      "text": "Hey Product Hunters, our team at Appwrite is excited to launch [Imagine.dev](http://Imagine.dev) on Product Hunt today (currently at #1). Imagine \n\nWe built Imagine because we believe software creation shouldn’t be limited to people who already know how to code, set up infrastructure, or glue together dozens of tools just to get something working.\n\nWith Imagine, you can go from an idea to a real product in minutes, whether that’s a prototype, a landing page, an internal tool, or a full app you want to share with the world. Just describe what you want to build, and Imagine helps you create real working products.\n\n**Imagine is the alternative to Lovable, Supabase, and Vercel, in a single platform.**  \nThat means **no need to**:\n\n\\- Integrate multiple vendors  \n\\- Manage multiple subscriptions  \n\\- Worry about security across a scattered stack  \n  \nWith Imagine, you can go from **prompt → working app**, and still have the fundamentals builders care about: a real backend, real data, real auth, real deployments, without the glue code and setup overhead.\n\nImagine is built on top of Appwrite’s cloud infrastructure, so it’s designed for builders who want to move fast, but still want things like security, scalability, and production-ready foundations from day one.\n\nWe’d love your feedback. We’re here all day to help you answer any questions!\n\nLearn more on our PH launch page:   \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/imagine-2](https://www.producthunt.com/products/imagine-2)",

That assumption didn’t hold up.\n\nLately, instead of brainstorming or running discovery calls, I’ve been studying what already works. I spent time going through StartupIdeas-DB which I found on google, looking only at products that were already live and making money.\n\nOne of those ideas stuck with me enough that I’m now actively building something inspired by it. What’s funny is how plain it looked at first glance. No hype. No vision-heavy positioning. Just a very specific problem and a group of users willing to pay to make it go away.\n\nThat alone answered the validation question. Once people are paying, the conversation shifts. It’s no longer about whether the idea works, it’s about whether you can execute better, focus tighter, or distribute smarter.\n\nI still see value in talking to users, but I’ve found those conversations often surface opinions, not urgency. Payment is a much clearer signal. These days, when I evaluate ideas, I don’t ask whether they sound impressive.  \n  \nI ask whether someone is already paying for a solution. More often than not, the best ideas aren’t flashy. They’re obvious, boring, and already proven.\n\nHow do you usually validate, through conversations, or through existing revenue?",

      "text": "Hello 👋,\n\nYou’re about to build with AI. You open 47 tabs. Claude? GPT-4? Mistral? Which one actually solves your problem? You waste hours. I wasted couple of days on this.\n\nThat’s when I decided to build **ArchitectGBT.**\n\nI’m not a genius. I’m someone working a 9–5 and building on the side. Most nights it was just me, VS Code, and vibe coding sessions where Claude Sonnet kept suggesting ideas while I tried to glue everything together. That’s how ArchitectGBT slowly took shape.\n\nThe first version took 48 hours and was honestly pretty rough. But people from communities like r/vibecoding and r/llm tried it and gave direct, sometimes brutal feedback. I listened and iterated. A lot.\n\nThe Stripe payment flow alone took me about three weeks of back and forth. Fix, test, break, repeat. It was tedious and frustrating, but eventually everything clicked and the whole workflow finally felt solid. That’s when it started to feel like a real product, not just a side project.\n\nArchitectGBT now does more than just “pick a model” for you. \n\nYou get model recommendations that respect your constraints like cost, speed, and capability. \n\nYou get MCP server integration so you can plug into real AI tool workflows instead of copy-pasting prompts everywhere. \n\nThere’s a one-click deploy to Vercel so you can go from recommendation to a live app without touching DevOps. \n\nYou can also see your recommendation history so you can revisit decisions instead of rerunning everything from scratch.\n\nI built this for people like us: bootstrapped, short on time, tired of wasting days researching models and wiring everything up manually. If it saves you even one wasted afternoon, that’s a win.\n\nIf that sounds like you, try it. Its live & i am launching in PH soon.\n\nBr,\n\nPravin",
