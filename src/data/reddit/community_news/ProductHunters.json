      "text": "Heyy,\n\nWe just went live on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/figr-design-research-simplified) today and super excited to share this.\n\nWe built Figr AI because every AI design tool out there just builds what you tell it. No product context, no edge cases, no memory. You re-explain everything every single time.\n\nFigr is different. Feed it your live web app via Chrome extension, Figma files, Notion docs, screen recordings and it remembers your product. Then it actually thinks through UX before designing, surfaces edge cases, runs UX reviews, generates A/B variations and builds prototypes that match your real product. All grounded in 200k+ screen patterns.\n\nProduct thinking first. Design execution second.\n\nWould love your support and feedback 🙏\n\nSupport the launch here: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/figr-design-research-simplified](https://www.producthunt.com/products/figr-design-research-simplified)",

It’s not a test, it’s not diagnostic, it simply helps Haven adapt to the user’s needs while fully respecting boundaries.\n\n\nYou can find Haven by going to https://www.prometheussys.com/ For now, it works best on a Windows laptop or desktop, but an app is coming soon!\n\n\nHaven is always evolving.

Lock the aspect ratios you need behind $12/month paywalls\n4. Upload your videos to their servers (privacy concern)\n\nSo I built FreeCropper. However the result was not that good - I’m seeing single visitors per day basically no backlinks, and almost no returning users.\n\nI’ve tried targeting “free video cropper” SEO, keeping the UX extremely simple, and leaning hard into the free + privacy angle.\n\nIf you were in my position, what should you do? would you double down, monetize, or walk away?",

It scans ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI to see what they say when someone asks a buying question in your space.\n\nAfter scanning 50+ sites, here's what surprised me:\n\nMost businesses score below 30 out of 100. AI either doesn't mention them at all, or mentions competitors instead. The business owners had no idea.\n\nThe bigger problem is that these answers change constantly. A site that scored 70 last month can drop to 40 after a model update. Nobody's checking.\n\nWhat the tool actually does:\n\n* Scans all three major AI platforms for your domain\n* Shows you the exact questions where AI mentions competitors but not you\n* Generates fix pages — structured content that AI can actually parse and cite\n* Tells you which trust platforms (G2, Capterra, etc.) you need to get listed on\n* Weekly action plan so you know what to do next\n\nFree scan available. No signup, takes 10 seconds. You'll see your score across all three platforms.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h65mv1l7nujg1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a0cff2b507e40e92c496b7b24174f3bab33f4a6\n\nIf anyone here has a SaaS or local business, curious what you score.",

SO yeah it probably looks like rank tracking from the outside, but the idea is less about “ranking” and more about understanding how models talk about your category and giving founders feedback loops instead of guessing in the dark.",

There are no shortages of babies and mothers. Keep going with it.\n\nOne idea I would offer, if you're looking for more, is a cravings tracker (with foods to solve it). Cravings are a sign that vitamins, minerals, nutrients are missing. If you could pair with existing wearables eventually, it could make the data more precise. Tracking those cravings, and offering food solutions could legit help your app gain some momentum/retention.\n\nExample: Mother is craving pickles and liver. But she hates both those things. What else tastes better? What minerals or probiotics is she missing? Why is she craving it for this long?\n\nIt could be an awesome angle to explore. And it keeps them in your app, instead of going to gpt for answers.\n\nLemme know if you need any help. Wish you guys the best ✌️",

I was a \"ghost\" founder.\n\n**So, I built Luua (**[**http://luua.club**]()**) to fix my own broken workflow.**\n\nIt’s a **distribution engine** for founders and creators who are too busy building to write essays every day.\n\n* **Input:** Your bookmarks, YouTube videos, or random notes.\n* **Output:** High-quality social posts that actually match your voice (no robotic \"delve/tapestry\" AI vibes).\n\nIt’s my **first-ever product launch** on Product Hunt today. I’m nervous, excited, and ready for your feedback.\n\n**Support the launch here:**[https://www.producthunt.com/products/luua?launch=luua]()",
