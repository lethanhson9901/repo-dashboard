      "text": "Most \"founders\" never launch anything.\n\nThey build a project for months, never complete it and eventually scrap the product. or launch it and get no customers.\n\nI did this 19 times before one finally stuck.\n\nStartups are truthfully a numbers game. even the best founders have hit rates under 10%. just look at founders like peter levels.\n\nSo how do you maximize your chances of success?\n\nthe honest answer is to increase the number of ideas you validate.\n\n# i'm going to get hate for this\n\nyou should NOT spend hundreds of hours building a product... until you know for certain that there is demand.\n\ni learned this the hard way.\n\nspent 6 months building an idea, copying every competitor feature, plus adding more features based on chatgpt recommendations.\n\nresult: $0 mrr\n\nwhy? because i was building solutions to make money instead of solving problems other people were willing to pay to solve.\n\n# here's what actually works\n\n**you should validate with conversations first.**\n\nnot a complete product, not a landing page.\n\nhere's what i did that finally worked:\n\n**step 1: use ai to validate demand (10 minutes)**\n\nused claude's deep research to scrape reddit threads, linkedin posts, x conversations where \\[icp\\] complains about \\[the problem you want to solve\\].\n\nThen use some fancy idea validation prompts (there are plenty of them on the internet), use swot analysis etc.\n\nAlso by your instinct figure out if it's a vitamin problem or painkiller problem\n\n**step 2: find where your customers are making buying decisions**\n\nnot where they hang out. where they're actively solving the problem.\n\nfor me: linkedin posts where top creators in my niche share. most engagers are my exact customers.\n\nspent 2 hours finding 5-10 of these places.\n\n**step 3: have 50 real conversations**\n\nsent 50 personalized linkedin messages / cold emails / cold dms per day.\n\nnot pitches. actual conversations , ex: \"saw you're posting daily. what's the most annoying part of coming up with content?\"\n\nresponse rate: 10-15%.\n\n**step 4: only then build the minimum**\n\nonce i had 10+ people saying \"i'd pay for that,\" i built ONE core feature that's 10x better than alternatives.\n\nmax time spent: 1 week.\n\neverything else came after people paid.\n\n# then what do you do?\n\nlaunch. post everywhere about it (reddit, x, linkedin) and message anyone on the internet who has the problem you're solving.\n\ndedicate yourself to marketing and sales for the first 4 hours of the day.\n\n**if you can't get paying customers within 2 weeks of launching... analyze why and iterate or kill it.**\n\nmost \"startups\" are not winners. and there are only THREE reasons why someone will not pay you:\n\n1. they don't actually have the problem\n2. they aren't willing to pay to solve the problem\n3. they don't think your product is good enough to try and pay for\n\n# this is where i'm going to get hate\n\n**it IS ethical to:**\n\n* validate demand with conversations before building\n* build an mvp in 1 week and charge for it\n* iterate based on paying customer feedback only\n\n**it is NOT ethical to:**\n\n* ask feedback from friends and family\n* run surveys and waitlists for months\n* build in isolation for 6 months without talking to users\n\ni used to tell users upfront: \"this is v1, built based on conversations with 50+ founders. if something's broken, i'll fix it in 24 hours.\"\n\n# my personal results from this strategy\n\nof the 19 ideas i validated:\n\n* 17 died in the conversation phase (people didn't care enough)\n* 1 died after launch (people signed up but didn't convert)\n* 1 is now at $195 mrr and growing ([brandled](https://brandled.app/))\n\nfor context on brandled:\n\n* spent 6 months at $0 building the wrong way\n* switched to this validation approach\n* got first paying user within 4 days of going all in on distribution\n* went all in on marketing and hit $195 mrr within 2 weeks\n* fixed retention (dropped churn from 50% to 15%)\n\n# what i learned\n\nthe difference wasn't the product. it was understanding what people actually wanted before building it.\n\n**stop wasting your time building products no one cares about.**\n\nvalidate with conversations. build the minimum. sell it. iterate based on paying customers only.\n\nrepeat.\n\nyou will get a hit if you do this... eventually.\n\nmost founders quit right before things work. not because their idea was bad. because they ran out of patience.\n\nthe difference between $0 and your first dollar isn't talent. it's refusing to quit when everything feels pointless.\n\ni'm documenting everything as i build [brandled](https://brandled.app/) (helps founders grow on x & linkedin without sounding like ai) to $10k mrr minimum.\n\nnot the highlight reel. the real shit. the 17 failed ideas. the 6 months at $0. the retention problems. all of it.\n\nif you're building something, hope this helps. stay in the game.",

          "text": "The core idea here is right: conversations before code, but I think you’re understating how hard it is to get 50 real, high-signal chats with your exact ICP if you don’t already live on LinkedIn/X. Most people doing this for the first time end up talking to other builders, not actual buyers, and then think they “validated” when they really just gathered polite noise.\n\n\n\nWhat helped me was forcing a constraint: no “validation” counts unless the person has previously paid to solve that problem in some way (software, freelancer, agency, internal time). That alone kills a ton of fake ideas. Also, your 2‑week “get a customer or kill it” rule works better if you anchor it to a specific channel (e.g., 14 days of only cold DMs, or only comments on Reddit/communities using something like SparkToro, PhantomBuster, and yeah, Pulse for Reddit in my case).\n\n\n\nThe core idea is still: treat conversations like experiments, not reassurance sessions, or you’ll just end up shipping a nicer version of what nobody wanted in the first place.",

      "text": "TrendEdge pulls in Reddit and all social sentiment in real time, mixes it with stuff like insider trades and macro events, and gives you a 1-10 score on momentum potential. We've been running it since early 2024, and the alerts line up with actual moves: NVDA scored a 9/10 and went up 124% after, PLTR hit 8/10 for 87%, and SMCI's 9/10 led to 156% in a few months. Everything's timestamped and public so you can check it yourself.\n\nThe new mock trading part is what I'm excited about. You can set up a mock portfolio right in the platform - pick stocks based on our signals and data, decide your position size and stops, and see how it plays out with alerts if sentiment shifts or price hits your levels. It ties back to the exact data that triggered the trade, so you learn what works without any real risk.\n\nTraders tell me it helps cut down on noise and build better habits, like using stops instead of guessing. \n\nWe're live on Product Hunt today, so if you trade momentum or follow Reddit chatter, an upvote, comment or quick trial would mean a lot. \n\nHere's the page: [TrendEdge](https://www.producthunt.com/products/trendedge?utm_source=other&utm_medium=social)   \n  \nThank you!\n\n",

Different approach tho, we focus more on alerts when things cross thresholds rather than scoring. Use my API to validate your data if you want 😛\n\nGood luck on PH! 🚀​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

It’s technically the best thing I’ve ever built. It’s polished and live. But instead of falling into the \"technical debt\" trap, I am walking away from the IDE to focus 100% on marketing and distribution. 🛑\n\n**Here is why:** High-maintenance tech is a cage. 🪤\n\nBuilding complex SaaS often feels like a \"Service Business\" with extra steps. If your energy is hogged by code, you can't scale the business. In 2026, the only real moat is **Distribution.** 🏆\n\nI’m moving on to master the game of growth. Nompany is live and stable, so I’m leaving the \"Engineering\" era behind to focus on getting this to 1M users.\n\nI’d love to support your launches today too! Drop your links below and let's help each other out. 🤝🚀\n\n**Support us on PH:** [https://www.producthunt.com/products/nompany?utm\\_source=other&utm\\_medium=social](https://www.producthunt.com/products/nompany?utm_source=other&utm_medium=social)\n\n**TL;DR:** I launched Nompany today.

A lot of PH launches stall because people treat launch day as the marketing plan.\n\nIf you want a quick next step, I would turn your best demo into 3-5 short clips and start posting them daily for a couple weeks (same hook, different angles). It compounds way better than one big announcement.\n\nAlso worth picking one ICP to start (ops teams at small agencies, CS teams, etc.) so your messaging lands.\n\nI have a small list of early SaaS marketing plays that might help after the PH push: https://www.promarkia.com\n\nGood luck this week.",

Have them be active every other day after they launch (upvoting, commenting, participating in the forums); don’t let them use AI to generate their posts or comments\n3. Make sure they fill out their profiles, including with a profile photo\n4. Make sure they authenticate with 2-4 services (e.g. Google, Github, LinkedIn, etc)\n5. Space out their engagement on your post on launch day to avoid the perception of “thundering hoards”\n6. Have fun! 🤩 \n\ntl;dr: Product Hunt has been inundated with bots and AI slop and added counter measures. This means organic and authentic engagement is rewarded, and low cost/easy engagement is penalized.\n\nIt’s not like you can join LinkedIn and on the same day expect to go viral, either.\n\nIt’s just the nature of the beast.\n\nIf you want to benefit from Product Hunt, you’ll have to do things that are hard/impossible for AI, bots, and spammers.\n\nGood luck.🍀",

I learned a lot, but I also carry that weight.\n\nFor the last 6 months, I’ve been coding a new product alone. No audience. No hype. No waitlist.

Why did I think *this* was a good idea?\n\nI didn’t think this through perfectly. I didn’t have a big plan. I just kept building because stopping felt worse.\n\nSo yeah, I don’t know if I should post about my tool.  \nI don’t know what will happen when I post on PH.  \nI don’t even know if I’ll get my first real user.\n\nBut I do know this: hiding forever guarantees nothing happens.\n\nPosting this mostly to say, if you’re also scared, spiralling, or sitting on something unfinished and judging yourself for it… you’re not alone.\n\nIf you’ve launched while feeling like this, I’d genuinely love to hear how it went.  \nEven if it flopped.\n\nThanks for reading. 🙏",

But lately, I see more and more founders launching products themselves as Makers.\n\nMy question to those who launched recently: Does having a Hunter actually impact your visibility or ranking today? Or has the algorithm changed enough that self-hunting is just as effective?\n\nI would prefer to post it myself to share my personal story, but I don't want to miss out on potential distribution if Hunters still carry extra weight.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!",

      "text": "Hey ProductHunters\n\nI just launched **FinalRun** on Product Hunt today, and this is our very first product.\n\nProblem:-  \nBefore releases, I spent hours, sometimes days, babysitting flaky tests. Our team ended up spending \\~40–50% of its time maintaining test scripts and fixing issues that could have been caught earlier. Existing tools (Appium, etc.) rely on brittle selectors and hard-coded scripts that break as soon as the UI changes or any random pop-up appears during testing.\n\nSolution:-\n\nSo I built a different approach from the ground up: test like a human. Describe the flow you want to test in plain English, and a Vision+Intent agent executes that flow on real Android and iOS devices. The agent understands context (if a pop-up appears,s it dismisses it and continues), maps intent to UI actions, and aims to make test definitions resilient across platforms.\n\nIt’s early and opinionated. We optimised for:\n\n1. drastically reduced test maintenance 2. fewer false failures in CI 3. a single test definition that works on both Android and iOS\n\nWe are genuinely looking for feedback from the Product Hunt community:\n\n* Do you think the problem resonates?\n* Is the value clear from the PH page?\n* Anything confusing or missing?\n\nHere’s our Product Hunt page:  \n👉 [https://www.producthunt.com/products/finalrun](https://www.producthunt.com/products/finalrun)\n\nHappy to answer questions and learn from fellow makers and hunters.  \nThanks for taking a look 🙌",

Our team is currently working on a real-time meeting assistant, and we are debating whether a formal PH launch is the right path for us. Our first product grew through organic channels and reached a stable user base without ever doing a launch, so we are now feeling \"newbies\" when it comes to the PH ritual. I’m curious to know what specifically makes a PH launch worth the effort for you—is it the community validation, the feedback, or something else entirely?\n\nWe are also trying to figure out which pre-launch preparations are truly essential and what post-launch actions actually help with long-term growth. In your honest opinion, what does the actual success of a launch depend on most, and are there common pitfalls that people usually overlook? Is it quite effective? Any insights or hindsight from those who have been through the fire would be much appreciated.",

PH is great for compressed feedback + visibility in a very specific crowd (makers, early adopters, loud opinions), but it rarely translates into sustained growth on its own unless you already have momentum or distribution lined up.\n\nThe launches I’ve seen work best treat PH less like a growth hack and more like a stress test. Tight positioning, a clear *aha* in the first 10 seconds, and being super active in comments matter way more than fancy pre-launch checklists. Biggest pitfall IMO is expecting PH to validate the business… it mostly validates your messaging and timing.",

You can log mileage manually from the odometer or via GPS, see the route on a map, and track fuel plus a basic “fuel balance” based on your car’s average consumption.

But even with organized notes, I often feel like I’m starting from scratch every time I revisit a topic. I’ve tried RSS feeds, bookmarking systems, and spreadsheets to track sources, but maintaining continuity still feels impossible.\n\nInformation is fragmented and constantly evolving. New research, news, and discussions appear daily, and I can’t realistically check every source manually. By the time I do, I’ve already lost the context from the previous week, so I end up re-learning the same things over and over. It’s mentally exhausting and feels like wasted time instead of building knowledge.\n\nRecently, I started using nbot ai, a tool I found on Product Hunt. It tracks topics continuously instead of giving one-off results, automatically summarizes changes, highlights important updates, and keeps a persistent knowledge base. Essentially, it remembers what I’ve already learned so I don’t have to. I’ve only been using it for a few weeks, but it’s already saved me hours and made my understanding feel much more coherent.",
