And how are you measuring whether the simulations actually improve real interview outcomes over time?",

We built something extremely demoable. If people understand it in 10 seconds, it spreads.\n2. Tight positioning. Not “another AI app.” Clear outcome: Speak → It does the work.\n3. Clean launch page. Short copy. Clear value. One core message.\n4. We activated our immediate network manually. Personal DMs. Not spam. Real conversations.\n5. We stayed online the entire launch window. Responded to every comment fast.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nNo hacks.  \nNo growth tricks.  \nJust usefulness + focus on launch day.\n\nHappy to share exact learnings if helpful.",

Every time something failed, I told myself \"one more try.\" That \"one more try\" happened 7+ times.\n\nFor this one, I sold my personal stuff to fund it. No investor, no safety net. Just me, alone, building something I kept feeling nobody had built right yet.\n\nHere's what kept bugging me - every creator and business sends traffic to their link-in-bio page. Thousands of visitors land there. And what do they see? Dead links sitting in a list. No story, no emotion, no reason to care. That traffic just... leaks.\n\nSo I built CroozLink. An AI that takes your links and weaves them into a story - it gives every link context, emotion, a reason to click. Your page stops being a parking lot and starts being an experience.\n\nAnd then I built Crooz Radar - think of it like live Q&A where your audience asks you questions in real-time. No algorithm filtering who sees what. But here's the part that excites me most - every question, every interaction becomes a source of organic traffic. People search those topics, they find your page. Your audience grows while you sleep.\n\nLess than 4 hours to go. I keep checking the clock every 2 minutes like it's gonna change something.\n\nIf you've ever poured everything into something and watched the clock before the world sees it - you know this feeling. Here is the PH Link if you want to support :- [https://www.producthunt.com/products/croozlink?launch=croozlink](https://www.producthunt.com/products/croozlink?launch=croozlink)\n\nAnd if it flops? See you at startup #9, Just kidding.",

Google Drive means opening a browser, uploading, fiddling with permissions, sharing the link and now there's a file sitting in my Drive that I'll use once and never think about again. WeTransfer wants email confirmations and it's just a whole thing.\n\nWe got tired of it honestly. Sharing a file should be fast and simple. So we made FileNotch. You drag a file to your MacBook's notch and boom, shareable link. Done. The other person just clicks and downloads, no account needed.\n\nWe added file encryption, password protection, email gating, download tracking, the baic stuff you'd want and need. And files auto-delete after a set period so you're not hoarding random stuff in the cloud forever.\n\nThere's a free version if you wanna check it out would appreciate some ProductHunt upvotes: [https://apps.apple.com/it/app/filenotch-transfer-files/id6758035666?mt=12](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/filenotch-transfer-files/id6758035666?mt=12)\n\n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/filenotch?utm\\_source=other&utm\\_medium=social](https://www.producthunt.com/products/filenotch?utm_source=other&utm_medium=social)\n\nWould love to hear what you think!",

Surely just not being at the bottom?\n* How much traffic typically converts from PH in 2026?\n\nI’m not expecting magic.\n\nBut I also don’t want to waste the spike if there’s a smarter way to handle it.\n\nWould really value your input and don't mind the harsh criticism. \n\nIf youve run a launch before, what actually made a difference?\n\nAnd what turned out to be a complete waste of time?\n\n  \nThank you :)\n\n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/myautobot-ai](https://www.producthunt.com/products/myautobot-ai)\n\n",

Maybe it starts giving slightly off answers. No error. No crash. No alert. Your monitoring says everything is green. You find out when a customer complains. Or you never find out at all.\n\nThe tools that exist today -- LangSmith, Langfuse, Braintrust -- they're all observability. They tell you what happened after something goes wrong. That's useful, but it's a rearview mirror. Nobody is actually intervening in real time.\n\n**What Vex does:**\n\nVex is a runtime reliability layer for AI agents. You add 3 lines of code to your agent, and Vex continuously verifies every output in production. When it detects drift, hallucinations, or policy violations, it doesn't just alert you. It auto-corrects the output before your user ever sees it.\n\nThink of it as spell-check for AI agents, running in production, in real time.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nThree layers. \n\nFirst, observation -- Vex watches every LLM call, tool use, and decision your agent makes. \n\nSecond, correction -- when something goes wrong, Vex blocks bad output and replaces it with a corrected response, mid-flight. \n\nThird, optimization -- Vex learns from every failure pattern and automatically tunes your agent's behavior over time.\n\n**Where we are:**\n\nVex is open source, Apache 2.0. Python and TypeScript SDKs are live. We have our first paying customer in production. We're onboarding more design partners this month and seeing strong pull from teams running multi-agent pipelines in production.",

Solo founder.\n\nProblem: 88% of business cards get trashed in a week. Digital card tools (Popl, HiHello, Blinq) fixed the card — but not what happens after. 48% of salespeople never follow up once. 80% of sales need 5+ touches. The gap between \"nice to meet you\" and \"deal closed\" is a graveyard.\n\nSolution: Vinc = digital card + native CRM + automated follow-up in one product. Tap the card → lead captured → intro email fires in 10 seconds → follow-up sequence runs → everything tracked. No Zapier. No manual entry. No leads lost to inertia.\n\nWhy it's different: Built on open-source ERP,  not stitched together from APIs. The CRM and automation are native, not bolted on. \n\nBusiness model: SaaS subscriptions + high-margin NFC hardware (dropship, zero inventory)\n\nAsk: Feedback, intros to enterprise pilots (real estate, sales orgs, events), early-stage investors into capital-efficient SaaS.\n\nHappy to demo.",

      "text": "Hey r/ProductHunters, \n\nI just launched on Product Hunt and would love some support from the community.\n\nWhat's Your Attention Worth? is a free calculator that estimates how much the advertising industry has spent putting ads in front of you since you first went online. You enter your age, country, and gender and it shows your estimated lifetime ad spend based on real industry CPM rates, adjusted for your demographic, historical ad density by era, and platform mix.\n\nSome context: I work in programmatic advertising. I built this because most people have no idea how much money flows through the system to reach them. The average American has had $90,000+ spent targeting them by age 35. That number surprised even people in my own industry.\n\nWhat makes it different:\n\n* CPM rates adjusted by country and age bracket using published industry data\n* Historical ad density scaling (your 90s internet years aren't charged at 2025 rates)\n* Everything runs in your browser, your inputs never leave your device\n* No signup, no paywall, completely free\n\nIt already got featured on iHeartRadio's Rod Ryan Show and picked up 19K+ upvotes across Reddit with people sharing their numbers.\n\nWould really appreciate an upvote on Product Hunt: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/attention-worth?launch=attention-worth](https://www.producthunt.com/products/attention-worth?launch=attention-worth)\n\nHappy to answer any questions about how the ad tech math works.

From 350 anonymized scans:\n\n* 62% fire tracking before consent\n* 7% lose Google Ads conversions due to consent issues\n* 14% have critical failures\n\nJust added $9/mo monitoring (weekly rescans + alerts) because sites keep re-breaking after updates.\n\nStill very early, first paid report ($19 detailed fixes) came in last week after a month of Reddit/HN posts. Solo project, no funding, just trying to solve a pain I kept seeing in Ads attribution.\n\nIf you have a minute tomorrow and think it looks useful (or just want to support an indie maker), an upvote or comment would mean a lot, helps a ton with visibility on PH.\n\nNo pressure at all, and brutal feedback welcome too.\n\nLaunch link (live tomorrow): [https://www.producthunt.com/posts/consentcheck](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/consentcheck)  \nFree scan here if curious: [https://consentcheck.online](https://consentcheck.online)\n\nThanks in advance, really appreciate the community!",

Just trying to understand what realistically moves the needle now.\n\nIf you’ve launched before:\n\n* What worked unexpectedly well?\n* What didn’t matter as much as you thought?\n* Anything you’d do differently?\n\nAppreciate any real experiences.

Also, the algorithm heavily favors active discussions. You need to be glued to your screen on launch day responding to absolutely every single comment and question within minutes. Good luck!",

          "text": "One thing founders massively underestimate is that Product Hunt ranking isn’t just about raw upvotes — it’s about **velocity + engagement quality in the early window**.\n\nLaunches that break Top 5 usually have a coordinated push in the first few hours where people don’t just upvote, but also comment, discuss, and return to the page. That activity signals relevance far more than passive votes spread across the day.\n\nAlso worth planning for the mid-day drop. Many launches spike early then stall because outreach stops. The teams that keep momentum going with follow-ups, new audiences, and updates tend to climb while others fade.\n\nThis launch-day timeline breaks down those phases hour-by-hour if you want something practical to follow:  \n[https://uprowshub.com/campaigns/blog/product-hunt-launch-day-timeline](https://uprowshub.com/campaigns/blog/product-hunt-launch-day-timeline)\n\nDefinitely doable with prep.

The Hunter field only shows up AFTER you select \"I didn't work on this product\" in the \"Did you work on this launch?\" section. If you select \"I worked on this product,\" PH assumes you're self-hunting and hides the Hunter assignment field.\n\n\n\nSo the workaround: select \"I didn't work on this product,\" and the Hunter invite field should appear. Then you can search for and add your Hunter by their PH username.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can share the draft link directly with your Hunter and they can claim the hunt from their end.
