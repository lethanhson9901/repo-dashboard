      "text": "Hey, I went into SaaS last year with my tool [Brandled ](https://brandled.app/)(helps founders grow on X & LinkedIn) in a pretty competitive space with $0 and 0 audience and ended up wasting six months straight on the wrong things.\n\nSpent half a year stuck at $0 MRR.\n\nThen I became obsessed with one question: what separates SaaS products that make it from those that die at zero.\n\nSo I went down a rabbit hole. Studied 47 founders who went from $0 to $10k+ MRR in the last year. Watched their podcasts, red their tweets, and everything i could get my hands on.\n\nHere's what I learned from all of them, and what I was doing catastrophically wrong.\n\n**1. Frictionless signup isn't optional**\n\nEvery successful product had one-click social login. Google OAuth mostly.\n\nThe ones that died had email verification flows, password requirements, multi-step forms asking questions before showing any value.\n\nThe math is brutal. If you lose 30% of people at signup and you're getting 1000 visitors a month, that's 300 potential customers gone. At a 10% trial-to-paid conversion, that's 30 paying customers per month lost to signup friction alone.\n\nI started with magic link only. Completion rate was 45%. Added Google login. Jumped to 78% the next day.\n\nEvery percentage point of friction at signup costs you real revenue. Most founders don't even measure this.\n\n**2. They launched in weeks, not months**\n\nNone of them spent 6 months building in secret.\n\nAverage time from idea to first paying customer: 3-6 weeks. They launched with ONE core feature. Then spent most of their time marketing it.\n\nI did the opposite. Spent 3 months building features before launching. Content generation, analytics, scheduling, competitor tracking, everything. Got 12 signups. Zero paying customers.\n\nConvinced myself the product wasn't good enough. Spent another month adding features. Still nothing.\n\nThe problem wasn't my product. Nobody knew it existed.\n\nAfter I stopped building and started marketing, posting on Reddit, doing LinkedIn outreach, documenting on X, I hit $126 MRR in 4 days.\n\nSame product. Different approach.\n\nPost-launch is 90% marketing, 10% product.\n\n**3. They were shameless about promotion**\n\nThe successful ones talked about their product everywhere. Not spammy. Just never hiding it.\n\nReddit threads. Twitter replies. Forum comments. Anywhere their audience hung out.\n\nThey'd give genuinely helpful advice first, then naturally mention their tool when relevant.\n\nStarted being shameless. Every relevant conversation where someone complained about the problem I solved, I'd help them first, then mention I built something for this.\n\nA few people definitely get mad but I feel the upside is worth it.\n\nYour product won't discover itself.\n\n**4. They asked churned users what went wrong**\n\nEvery successful product had a system for this. Automated email going out when someone cancels asking what didn't work.\n\nI was doing none of this. Saw cancellations in Stripe, felt rejected, moved on. Never asked why. Never learned anything.\n\nNow every cancelled user gets emails through and automated email sequence and the replies are done by me personally.\n\nResponse rate is 40%. The feedback is literally gold.\n\nEvery single one is fixable. But I only learned because I asked.\n\nChurned users tell you the real truth about your product.\n\n**5. They used their own product religiously**\n\nNot one successful founder was building something they didn't use daily. They were their own heaviest users.\n\nI wasn't doing this. Used my tool occasionally to \"test\" but wasn't relying on it daily.\n\nForced myself to create all my content through my own product for a week. Found 7 bugs in 30 minutes that never showed up in testing.\n\nGenerate button didn't work on mobile. Analytics took 8 seconds to load. Onboarding skipped steps if you refreshed.\n\nMy users were experiencing this and not telling me. They were just leaving.\n\nIf you're not using your product daily as a real user, you're building blind.\n\n**6. They fixed retention before scaling acquisition**\n\nBiggest strategic difference.\n\nFailed products: 30-50% monthly churn, constantly chasing new users to replace ones leaving.\n\nSuccessful products: Fixed retention first, got churn to 10-20%, then scaled acquisition.\n\nThe math: At 40% churn, you acquire 40 customers to net 24. At 15% churn, you acquire 40 and net 34. Same effort, 42% better results.\n\nI was obsessed with new signups. Ignored my 40% churn rate. Got 10 new customers, lost 4. Net: 6.\n\nStopped all acquisition. Fixed onboarding from 8 steps to 3. Added email sequences. Built features retained users asked for. Churn dropped to 15%.\n\nSame acquisition effort, now net 8-9 customers instead of 6.\n\nRetention is the foundation. Acquisition is the multiplier.\n\n**7. They shipped MVPs with one feature**\n\nEvery successful product launched stupidly lean. One core feature done exceptionally well.\n\nI launched with 7 features: content generation, analytics, scheduling, competitor tracking, SWOT, comments, hashtags.\n\nCodebase was a nightmare. Users were confused. I was maintaining features 3% of users touched.\n\nShould've launched with one thing: AI content that sounds human. Made that 10x better. Everything else later based on what paying customers asked for.\n\nYour MVP should make people say \"this solves my exact problem\" even if ugly and missing features.\n\nNot \"wow, so many features\" while solving nothing particularly well.\n\n**8. They priced based on value, not competition**\n\nNone of them raced to the bottom on pricing.\n\nThey looked at the value delivered. Hours saved. Revenue generated. Pain eliminated.\n\nThen priced a fraction of that value.\n\nI priced at $19/month because competitors were at $29-39. Thought I'd win on price. Just looked cheap and inferior.\n\nNeeded 263 customers to hit $5k MRR at $19 versus only 128 at $39.\n\nRaised price to $29-39. Conversions didn't drop. They improved slightly.\n\nHigher price signaled solving a valuable problem.\n\nPeople who care about $10 differences aren't your best customers. They'll churn for anything $3 cheaper.\n\n**9. They automated relationship building**\n\nEvery successful product had email sequences from day one. Not promotional. Actual value and engagement.\n\nWelcome emails. Feature education. Check-ins. Re-engagement for quiet users. Win-back for churned users.\n\nI was sending nothing after signup. Users signed up, got busy, forgot, churned.\n\nEngagement doesn't happen by accident. You engineer it.\n\n**10. They validated with money, not words**\n\nThe problem with feedback: it's free. People say nice things because it costs them nothing.\n\nI built features based on \"that would be helpful\" comments from users who weren't even paying. Wasted weeks on features nobody used.\n\nNow I only build what paying customers explicitly request.\n\nMoney is the only validation that matters. Words are cheap. Credit card numbers are truth.\n\n**The one thing they all had**\n\nThey didn't quit when it felt hopeless.\n\nThey all hit $0 for months. Got depressed. Questioned everything. Wanted to shut it down.\n\nBut didn't.\n\nThe difference between $0 and success wasn't talent or luck. It was not quitting before they figured out what works.\n\n90% of SaaS products die not because they couldn't work. Because the founder quit too early.\n\nIf you're stuck at $0, study the people who've made it. Not the outliers. The normal founders who went from $0 to $10k.\n\nThey're not special. They just did specific things that compound and didn't quit when it got hard.\n\nThe playbook is right there. You just have to execute it.\n\nHappy to answer questions or go deeper on any of this.",

Have them be active every other day after they launch (upvoting, commenting, participating in the forums); don’t let them use AI to generate their posts or comments\n3. Make sure they fill out their profiles, including with a profile photo\n4. Make sure they authenticate with 2-4 services (e.g. Google, Github, LinkedIn, etc)\n5. Space out their engagement on your post on launch day to avoid the perception of “thundering hoards”\n6. Have fun! 🤩 \n\ntl;dr: Product Hunt has been inundated with bots and AI slop and added counter measures. This means organic and authentic engagement is rewarded, and low cost/easy engagement is penalized.\n\nIt’s not like you can join LinkedIn and on the same day expect to go viral, either.\n\nIt’s just the nature of the beast.\n\nIf you want to benefit from Product Hunt, you’ll have to do things that are hard/impossible for AI, bots, and spammers.\n\nGood luck.🍀",

      "text": "When we launched on Product Hunt, one of the biggest lessons wasn’t about traffic or upvotes, it was about timing and financial readiness. Launching takes more time and energy than expected, and if your runway isn’t clear, that pressure becomes very real very fast.\n\nWhile working on **Startup Runway**, a tool focused on helping founders calculate runway and plan cash properly, we saw firsthand how many teams launch without really knowing how long they can sustain momentum after launch. It’s easy to focus on visibility and ignore the financial side until it becomes urgent.\n\nThe experience reinforced that a launch isn’t just a marketing moment. It’s a financial decision too. Knowing your burn rate and how much room you have to experiment changes how confidently you show up and engage with the community.\n\nI’m curious for those who’ve launched on Product Hunt, did you feel financially prepared going in, or did you figure things out as you went?",

      "text": "Hey ProductHunters\n\nI just launched **FinalRun** on Product Hunt today, and this is our very first product.\n\nProblem:-  \nBefore releases, I spent hours, sometimes days, babysitting flaky tests. Our team ended up spending \\~40–50% of its time maintaining test scripts and fixing issues that could have been caught earlier. Existing tools (Appium, etc.) rely on brittle selectors and hard-coded scripts that break as soon as the UI changes or any random pop-up appears during testing.\n\nSolution:-\n\nSo I built a different approach from the ground up: test like a human. Describe the flow you want to test in plain English, and a Vision+Intent agent executes that flow on real Android and iOS devices. The agent understands context (if a pop-up appears,s it dismisses it and continues), maps intent to UI actions, and aims to make test definitions resilient across platforms.\n\nIt’s early and opinionated. We optimised for:\n\n1. drastically reduced test maintenance 2. fewer false failures in CI 3. a single test definition that works on both Android and iOS\n\nWe are genuinely looking for feedback from the Product Hunt community:\n\n* Do you think the problem resonates?\n* Is the value clear from the PH page?\n* Anything confusing or missing?\n\nHere’s our Product Hunt page:  \n👉 [https://www.producthunt.com/products/finalrun](https://www.producthunt.com/products/finalrun)\n\nHappy to answer questions and learn from fellow makers and hunters.  \nThanks for taking a look 🙌",
