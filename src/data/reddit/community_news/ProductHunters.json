It would genuinely mean the world to us 🙏\n\nWe are currently live and fighting our way up the rankings.\n\n👉 Product Hunt launch link:\n\n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/kalendar-work-the-calendly-replacement?launch=kalendar-work&utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_campaign=reddit\\_ph\\_posts](https://www.producthunt.com/products/kalendar-work-the-calendly-replacement?launch=kalendar-work&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=reddit_ph_posts)\n\nAnd if you are launching this week, happy to return the favor.

So, I'd keep it short.\n\nI'm currently 'building' two products side by side-\n\n1. arkera.in, this is perhaps the simplest project management tool there is and I'd like to keep it that way. After I used several project management tools in my agency, I always felt there's too much more than what a small agency, business or solopreneurs need. Costly and feature overload led me to build this one.\n\n2. Vaultana, one-link end-to-end contract software which helps businesses to have secure deal by locking payment without actually debiting it from the client end. Assisted with AI for quicker dispute resolution.\n\n\nProblem. Both of these requires money and so, I am genuinely very hopeful which is exactly why I am building this slowly. Arkera is almost done while vaultana will take time. \n\nI'd seek investments or the grant to help launch, as I already have genuine demands for both. If none, I'd be glad to have your feedback and criticism.\n\n'One chance is all we need'",

      "text": "Kinda embarrassing to post but\n\nLast year we built this B2B tool for used car dealerships. Helps them price inventory, spot damage in trade-ins, etc. Boring enterprise software.\n\nWe're doing the whole startup thing and sent cold emails, demo calls, events. during demos and events we would always get \"hey can I just use this to check a car I'm looking at on facebook/craigslist/carmax?\" And we'd be like \"no sorry, this is for dealerships only, sorry\" and move on.\n\nThis kept happening though and we (stupidly) just kept saying no.\n\nThen in August I needed to move from California to NYC. UHaul wanted $5,300 to rent a truck. I'm broke from the startup and all I had left was like $6k, so I said I'll just buy a cheap truck and sell it when I get there.\n\nProblem was im a car guy that knows sports cars. I don't know trucks. So I just used our own product on facebook listings until I found a 2001 GMC Sierra for $5,300. Tool said the center support bearing was probably bad. I bought it anyway and drove it 3,000 miles. Bearing sounded terrible the whole time and exploded in New Mexico. Sold it in Philly for $6,800. Still made a profit moving my stuff across the country.\n\nHad a meeting with my co-founder and basically just said people keep asking for this, and it works, so should we just build it? Spent like 2 months ripping out the dealer stuff and making a consumer version. Threw up a really basic landing page. Priced it at $5 per report because that seemed reasonable. Used the truck story as the homepage because we didn't know what else to put.\n\nWe just launched on Product Hunt but, of course, no one normal looking for a car has an account there so their upvotes just vaporize. We halfassed the most important part of Product Hunt 101. Sharing this story with you so you have those PH accounts ready early.

      "text": "Hey Product Hunters, our team at Appwrite is excited to launch [Imagine.dev](http://Imagine.dev) on Product Hunt today (currently at #1). Imagine \n\nWe built Imagine because we believe software creation shouldn’t be limited to people who already know how to code, set up infrastructure, or glue together dozens of tools just to get something working.\n\nWith Imagine, you can go from an idea to a real product in minutes, whether that’s a prototype, a landing page, an internal tool, or a full app you want to share with the world. Just describe what you want to build, and Imagine helps you create real working products.\n\n**Imagine is the alternative to Lovable, Supabase, and Vercel, in a single platform.**  \nThat means **no need to**:\n\n\\- Integrate multiple vendors  \n\\- Manage multiple subscriptions  \n\\- Worry about security across a scattered stack  \n  \nWith Imagine, you can go from **prompt → working app**, and still have the fundamentals builders care about: a real backend, real data, real auth, real deployments, without the glue code and setup overhead.\n\nImagine is built on top of Appwrite’s cloud infrastructure, so it’s designed for builders who want to move fast, but still want things like security, scalability, and production-ready foundations from day one.\n\nWe’d love your feedback. We’re here all day to help you answer any questions!\n\nLearn more on our PH launch page:   \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/imagine-2](https://www.producthunt.com/products/imagine-2)",

      "text": "Hey PH community,\n\nSix months ago, we launched **v1 of Meet-Ting**.\n\nIt was an AI you could email and simply CC to manage all your meeting admin - from planning, to booking, to rescheduling.\n\nIt was *hard*. At the time, AI didn’t really live in email, and group coordination was (and still is) emerging. Most AI is in chat windows. Once you add multiple people, the room for error = painful.\n\nSince then, we’ve launched Ting across **Gmail, Outlook, Zoom, Teams, and WhatsApp**, and we recently submitted our **ChatGPT integration**.\n\nAlong the way, we realized something important: **Scheduling isn’t just admin. Time = decisions, not logistics.**\n\nHow we feel about time changes daily - energy levels, deadlines, goals, clients shouting, ambition, guilt etc.\n\nSo Ting has been building **deep memories** with each user to learn what they value + how they make decisions about time.\n\nNow it’s ready to make decisions *for* you, so you don’t have to, because you’re already too busy!\n\nWe call Ting an **availability agent**, because we see a future where you don’t send emails or booking links: you send agents. And those agents need to understand what you value first!\n\nIf this hits, I’d really appreciate your support here: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/meet-ting/launches/meet-ting-2](https://www.producthunt.com/products/meet-ting/launches/meet-ting-2)\n\nThank you,\n\nDan (co-founder)",

That process is tedious and does disrupt your flow. \n\nSometimes I do pause the video if there's a lot of words explained by Gloss at once so I can read them properly. I'd say for 80% of the time for me it's sufficient but I think the rest of the time I do need to get a more detailed explanation and then I go on chatgpt for example. \n\nI've been thinking about adding a chat within gloss so that it'll help users understand deeper still within the context of the video if the explanation isn't enough.

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’ve spent the last two months promoting my project on Reddit. Went viral, got removed by moderators, and everything in between.\n\nHere’s a recap of what I did, what works, and what doesn’t:\n\n* **Launch posts (work)**: there are a ton of communities that let you showcase your product without getting banned, I made a list of subreddits with my target audience -> read the community guidelines on self-promotion -> checked if they have a dedicated flair or a designated day (usually on Saturday) -> shared my product. The first time it didn’t get any views/upvotes but I continued working on the copy until I found one that goes viral regularly. My best tips?\n   1. *Match the tone of the community*: this is what makes the difference between going viral and getting ignored (or banned).\n   2. *Subreddit size doesn’t matter that much*: people ignore smaller communities, but I had the same post go viral in a 95K subreddit and in a 9.5K one and got nearly the same visits to my project.\n   3. *Let Reddit help you*: if you’re struggling to find subreddits that match your product go to Reddit ads page -> setup your account -> click \"create campaign\" -> insert keywords related to your product and Reddit will auto suggest the most relevant subreddits.\n* **Shameless plugs (work, but probably I shouldn’t say it)**: general advice to write a comment to promote your product is something along the lines of *\"I had the same problem last year. Tried a bunch of solutions but found \\[tool\\] worked best for my use case. The key was \\[specific feature\\]. Went from \\[before state\\] to \\[after state\\] in about \\[timeframe\\]\"*. That’s a lot of work and not always needed. If your product is a direct answer to the question just share it, but make sure to disclose you’re the founder (proof: one of my shameless plugs got 25 upvotes and a couple hundred visitors to my project).\n* **“What are you building?” posts (don’t work)**: I’ve shared my project in a few “what are you building” posts. Results? Crickets. People are there to write comments, not to read the comments.\n* **Tracking conversations (works)**: I regularly track the visitors coming from reddit and their conversion rates. I don’t always have the time to leave a reply but just scrolling trought the comments helps me better understand users (I’ve already stolen a couple of ideas to improve my copy). If you have no idea about what to track, start with competitor mentions, keywords related to the problem/pain point you solve, or mentions of specific features.\n* **DMs (don’t scale)**: I’m not really a fan of DMs, Reddit is great at getting views and moving the conversation in 1vs1 won’t get you any. They only make sense when you fear your comment could be downvoted into oblivion.\n* **Content Strategy (not sure)**: I’ve shared me journey or growth experiments or just posts I thought would be interesting for my audience. (7 months of \"vibe coding\" a SaaS and here's what nobody tells you, You WILL Reach $10K MRR (If You Follow This Simple SaaS Routine),I studied 47 SaaS products that went from 0 to 10k MRR last year. Here's what they all did right),\n* for context my project is a [saas tool](https://brandled.app/) sometimes adding a link at the end or a softfer CTA inviting to check out my project. Some got a few thousand views, others were so bad that they didn’t even get AI-generated comments. However, none of them brought a significant spike in visitors (probably a skill issue on my side).\n\nThere you have it, nothing fancy, nothing controversial. This strategy got me 550k+ impressions in my first month.\n\nI’d love to hear if you’ve tried something similar or if you have other tips on marketing on Reddit.",

After featuring a product, I’ve been considering asking the maker if they’d be open to adding a small *“As seen on Launch Llama”* badge to their site as social proof.\n\nNo money involved, totally optional.\n\nGenuinely curious how other PH makers think about this. Is this something you'd do?\n\nThanks!",

We are obsessing over our landing page design right now, and if a badge clashes with our palette, we’d hesitate to add it. If it blends in? No brainer.",
