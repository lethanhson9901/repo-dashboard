The default media engine is DirectShow which supports more advanced options such as frame interpolation, higher quality scalers, proper HDR support, etc.\n\nSome of the premium features include a much more modern and highly customizable user interface, a media library, browsing content and streaming from PLEX, Emby, Jellyfin media servers. TV/VOD streaming with EPG support (from a provider of your choice). Dual UI modes (Windowed and Home Theater) and much much more.\n\nOh... and me, a responsive developer who listens to what people wants and tries to act upon it (within what my resources as an Indie dev. allow).",

And I’ve noticed a weird pattern:\n\nWhen someone is about to launch, they’re super active. Once they launch… they kinda disappear.\n\nNot judging, I genuinely get that people are busy, tired, burned out, whatever. But it made me think: if someone showed up for you during your launch, isn’t it just good karma to show up for others too?\n\nIt takes like 30–60 seconds to throw an upvote or a quick comment.\n\nWhy do you think this happens? Post-launch burnout? People only show up when they need something? Too many asks?",

Just me, the code, and a belief that if the product is genuinely good, it can speak for itself.\n\nA few things I think helped this launch:\n\n  \n🎯**Extreme clarity in the tagline**\n\nI cut all the buzzwords. “Tab-to-complete everywhere” is it. If someone can’t understand what a product does in a couple seconds, they’re gone. Clarity beats cleverness every time.\n\n🙂 **Putting a face to it**\n\nSo many AI tools feel anonymous. I wanted the opposite. I showed my face in the demo and thumbnail because I want people to know there’s a real person behind this, and that I stand behind what I’m building.\n\n✨ **Treating design as trust**\n\nPeople decide fast. I spent a lot of time on the gallery images because screenshots are the first signal of quality. If it looks thoughtful and polished, people assume the product is too.\n\n\n\nI’ll be around in the comments, so happy to answer anything or hear what resonated.\n\n— Jared",

What surprised me wasn’t the difficulty of creating the content, it was how *overcomplicated* selling it was.\n\nEvery platform wanted me to:\n\n* set up a full shop\n* create a public profile\n* pay monthly fees\n* wait weeks to get paid\n\nAll I wanted was to share a link and get paid.\n\nSo I built **Crealo** — a lightweight way to sell digital products without the usual friction.\n\nWith Crealo you can:\n\n* connect Stripe once and get paid directly to your bank\n* upload a file (PDF, video, image, text)\n* customize a clean product page and share a simple payment link\n\nNo storefronts, no unnecessary settings.  \nBuyers pay → download → you get paid.\n\nI’m still early and building this openly, so I’d really love feedback from creators or indie hackers here:\n\n👉 What digital product have you wanted to sell but didn’t because the setup felt too complex?\n\nHappy to answer questions and learn from your thoughts 🙌\n\n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/crealo](https://www.producthunt.com/products/crealo)",

The goal is to make voice notes actually useful instead of turning into audio files you never revisit.\n\n**What Echo does:**\n\n* Records voice notes, meetings, or quick ideas\n* Automatically turns audio into text\n* Creates short summaries from long recordings\n* Lets you ask questions about past notes\n* Keeps everything searchable and organized\n\nWe built this because typing during meetings or when ideas hit feels slow and distracting. Voice is faster, but raw recordings are messy. Echo tries to close that gap by making voice structured and easy to work with.\n\nIf this sounds interesting, we are live on Product Hunt today and would really appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or criticism:  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/echo-35?launch=echo-fd149df1-a337-4f81-9665-8ff9e426ac4f](https://www.producthunt.com/products/echo-35?launch=echo-fd149df1-a337-4f81-9665-8ff9e426ac4f)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the product, the build process, or why we chose to focus on voice notes in the first place.",

Try focused community outreach where you answer threads with real value to build trust, run short targeted ads toward anxiety/sleep keywords to drive interested users, and collect quick in-app feedback prompts to iterate fast; each moves awareness, converts curious folks, and sharpens messaging. If scaling outreach becomes a headache you could try a service that finds Reddit posts asking for solutions and drafts founder style replies for your OK, would love feedback or to connect if you try it, and good luck with Plesso launch!",

Need your review!\n\nI usually have a lot of back-office tasks to do, so I built a computer-use agent to do that for me.\n\nHere are my use cases: I used it to translate English documents into Japanese. Took about 10 minutes. Normally, I have to spend hours copy-pasting into ChatGPT (DeepL before ChatGPT became a thing). I also used it to batch-caption 50 product images for an e-commerce site. The agent analyzed each image and generated product descriptions.\n\nI have another common use case that I think most AI agents can do. I had a messy download folder with 50+ files. Told the agent to organize the file by content type and rename them descriptively. It scanned each file, figured out what it was, created folders, and sorted everything.\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/open-sourced-the-ai-agent-i-use-to-automate-repetitive-v0-hseicepsc49g1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7e6c590a93c1a9e4bdfe93bb856ec3ede3f31ad)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggm3h5vqj49g1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b5fdb1e94b386f3e360179b0581afd7bb7a598f\n\nThe computer-use AI agent has a TUI interface. I give instructions, it plans the steps, and executes them. It can control your browser, interact with your OS, and handle high-volume repetitive work.\n\nYou can use it as it is, or extend it. There is a custom agent layer where you can inject your own tools and identity to build specialized agents.\n\nIf you automate boring desktop work, this might save you some time. If you're building agents, feel free to extend the code base too. It is open-source and free to host.\n\nGithub link here ([https://github.com/zfoong/WhiteCollarAgent](https://github.com/zfoong/WhiteCollarAgent)). Star it if you find it useful. PRs welcome.",

The AI analyzes your meal in seconds and gives you:\n\n\\- Calories\n\n\\- Macros (protein, carbs, fats)\n\n\\- Portion estimates\n\nYou can also log meals by voice - just say \"I had a chicken salad for lunch\" and it records everything.\n\n**Other features:**\n\n\\- AI-generated weekly meal plans adjusted to your goals\n\n\\- Smart shopping list with receipt scanning\n\n\\- Detailed stats and progress tracking\n\n**Why I built it:**\n\nI got tired of manually searching databases every time I wanted to log a meal. Taking a photo is just faster and more natural.\n\nThis is my first real product launch so any feedback or support would mean a lot 🙏\n\nLink in comments!  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/https-kaloria-app-en](https://www.producthunt.com/products/https-kaloria-app-en)\n\n",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a small product I’ve been working on called **Kandle – Chart Insights**, which just launched on Product Hunt today.\n\nProduct Hunt link:  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/kandle-chart-insights-2](https://www.producthunt.com/products/kandle-chart-insights-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**What it does:**  \nKandle lets you upload an image of a candlestick chart (screenshots, TradingView charts, photos, etc.) and gives you a simple, structured technical analysis. The idea is to help interpret trend, momentum, and overall structure without setting up indicators or re-creating charts.\n\n**Why I built it:**  \nI often save or receive chart screenshots and end up re-analyzing them later from scratch. Kandle is meant to make that process quicker and clearer, especially when you just want a second opinion or a fast read on a chart.\n\n**Current features include:**\n\n* Uploading chart images for analysis\n* Clear summaries of trend and structure\n* A clean interface focused on readability\n* Saved insights for later reference\n\nI’d really appreciate any feedback — what feels useful, what doesn’t, and what you’d want to see next. If you find it interesting, an upvote on Product Hunt would also help a lot.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or discuss how it works. Thanks for reading.",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nI just launched [https://www.producthunt.com/products/appspeaker](https://www.producthunt.com/products/appspeaker) I originally built it for myself and decided to finally share it more publicly.\n\n[www.appspeaker.io](https://reddit.com/link/1pzj3i4/video/ikt57z4amcag1/player)\n\nThe idea came from a very real problem I had as an indie developer. As my apps and games grew, replying to Google Play reviews stopped being manageable. More users, more reviews, multiple languages - but I still didn’t want to ignore them, because replies clearly affect ratings, trust, and overall app quality.\n\nSo I built a tool [www.appspeaker.io](http://www.appspeaker.io)  that helps developers handle Google Play reviews at scale. It reads only new reviews, understands what they’re about, and drafts replies in your own tone instead of generic AI answers. During testing on my own apps and games, I spent a lot of time refining custom instructions so the replies actually sound like the developer, not a bot.\n\nIt’s built mainly for developers with growing or popular apps who care about user communication but don’t want to spend hours every day answering the same questions.\n\nIf you’re dealing with review overload and want to see how it works, I’m happy to show it. Feedback from other developers is very welcome. \n\nThank You!   \nWojciech",

      "text": "Quick story: I used to believe in astrology heavily. Consulted multiple pandits about my life—some said I was doomed, others said I was blessed. I was confused as hell about who to trust.\n\nDuring a rough phase, I started asking ChatGPT about my birth chart. It was surprisingly accurate and consistent. That's when I thought—what if I could build a personal AI astrologer that actually sits in your phone 24/7?\n\nSo I built **OrbitPro**.\n\nPitched this idea 1.5 years ago. Nobody believed it could work. But I had this gut feeling this could be something real.\n\n**What we built:**\n\n* Available in 6 global languages\n* Orbit can TALK in 70+ international languages\n* Orbit TALKS and CHATS based on your natal chart\n* We trained a whole engine specifically for this\n* **Powered by Google**\n\n**Here's what I want you to do:**\n\n1. Generate your report on OrbitPro\n2. Ask the same questions to ChatGPT, Gemini, or any other LLM\n3. Compare the accuracy\n\nI hope we won't disappoint you. Try talking to Orbit. Try chatting with Orbit. I'm sure you won't regret it.\n\n**Going live:** 30 hours (January 1, 2026)  \n**BETA :** [**https://global-mvp-1-8.vercel.app/**](https://global-mvp-1-8.vercel.app/)\n\n**LIVE :** [orbitpro.ai](http://orbitpro.ai/)  \n**Code for Reddit fam:** **HEYORBIT** \\- gets you 80% off ($2/month)  \n**Valid:** First 1,000 users, 1 month only\n\n\n\n**Follow the journey:** [https://www.instagram.com/orbitpro.ai/](https://www.instagram.com/orbitpro.ai/)\n\n on Instagram\n\n\n\nDrop your honest feedback. That's all I ask.\n\nIf you vibe with it, share with **#HeyOrbit**\n\n**Credits:** Massive thanks to Google and all the tech influencers who believed in this vision and helped me build OrbitPro.\n\n* theorbitguy (Founder)\n\nLet's see where this goes. 🚀",

With Hard Mode (Screen Time API), the block is system-wide. So, if a user tries to doom-scroll, they literally can't open the app without killing their session and losing their progress. That friction is usually enough to break the loop. I like the idea of 'session goals' and 'community challenges'—definitely something I'm looking into for the roadmap.

Try 1) focus replies that invite specific next steps to turn profile views into signups, that helps close the loop between streaks and users, 2) diversify engagement beyond PH so you don't depend on being featured, that spreads attention across subs. I built SignalScouter to find posts where users ask for solutions and generate founder-style replies, it helped me get 89 waitlist signups in 2 days and 10k post views, would love feedback or to connect if you try it out, good luck.",

Would really appreciate your help!\n\n\n\nMost of us spend hours every day jumping between X, LinkedIn, news, newsletters, group chats - scrolling, saving, reopening tabs - and still end the day wondering: what actually mattered today? Did I miss something important?The problem isn’t lack of information. It’s too much noise and no clear signal. That’s why we built NBot.NBot acts like a personal AI radar. You tell it what you care about - a company, trend, topic, or market - and it continuously tracks updates for you. Instead of endless scrolling, you get a clear view of what changed, why it matters, and what’s worth paying attention to.\n\nIf this resonates, I’d really appreciate your support here: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/nbot](https://www.producthunt.com/products/nbot). Happy to support your projects as well!",
