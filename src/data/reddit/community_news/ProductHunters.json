      "text": "Heyy,\n\nWe just went live on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/figr-design-research-simplified) today and super excited to share this.\n\nWe built Figr AI because every AI design tool out there just builds what you tell it. No product context, no edge cases, no memory. You re-explain everything every single time.\n\nFigr is different. Feed it your live web app via Chrome extension, Figma files, Notion docs, screen recordings and it remembers your product. Then it actually thinks through UX before designing, surfaces edge cases, runs UX reviews, generates A/B variations and builds prototypes that match your real product. All grounded in 200k+ screen patterns.\n\nProduct thinking first. Design execution second.\n\nWould love your support and feedback 🙏\n\nSupport the launch here: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/figr-design-research-simplified](https://www.producthunt.com/products/figr-design-research-simplified)",

We crossed **100 signups**. A week in. That's honestly more than I could have hoped for.\n\nTo everyone who checked it out and signed up thank you, it genuinely means a lot and keeps me motivated to keep building.\n\nIf you haven't seen it yet: [https://launchtry.com/product/copsty](https://launchtry.com/product/copsty)\n\nMore updates to come. 🚀\n\nCheers! 👋",

          "text": "Every company shipping AI agents hits the same wall. The agent works great in testing. Passes all the evals. Ships to production. And then, slowly, it starts drifting. Maybe it hallucinates a feature that doesn't exist. Maybe it starts giving slightly off answers. No error. No crash. No alert. Your monitoring says everything is green. You find out when a customer complains. Or you never find out at all.\n\nThe tools that exist today -- LangSmith, Langfuse, Braintrust -- they're all observability. They tell you what happened after something goes wrong. That's useful, but it's a rearview mirror. Nobody is actually intervening in real time.\n\n**What Vex does:**\n\nVex is a runtime reliability layer for AI agents. You add 3 lines of code to your agent, and Vex continuously verifies every output in production. When it detects drift, hallucinations, or policy violations, it doesn't just alert you. It auto-corrects the output before your user ever sees it.\n\nThink of it as spell-check for AI agents, running in production, in real time.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nThree layers. First, observation -- Vex watches every LLM call, tool use, and decision your agent makes. Second, correction -- when something goes wrong, Vex blocks bad output and replaces it with a corrected response, mid-flight. Third, optimization -- Vex learns from every failure pattern and automatically tunes your agent's behavior over time.\n\n**Where we are:**\n\nVex is open source, Apache 2.0. Python and TypeScript SDKs are live. We have our first paying customer in production. We're onboarding more design partners this month and seeing strong pull from teams running multi-agent pipelines in production.",

          "text": "**Vex** is the runtime reliability layer for AI agents -- we detect when agents silently break in production and auto-correct before users notice.\n\nEvery company shipping AI agents hits the same wall. The agent works great in testing. Passes all the evals. Ships to production. And then, slowly, it starts drifting. Maybe it hallucinates a feature that doesn't exist. Maybe it starts giving slightly off answers. No error. No crash. No alert. Your monitoring says everything is green. You find out when a customer complains. Or you never find out at all.\n\nThe tools that exist today -- LangSmith, Langfuse, Braintrust -- they're all observability. They tell you what happened after something goes wrong. That's useful, but it's a rearview mirror. Nobody is actually intervening in real time.\n\n**What Vex does:**\n\nVex is a runtime reliability layer for AI agents. You add 3 lines of code to your agent, and Vex continuously verifies every output in production. When it detects drift, hallucinations, or policy violations, it doesn't just alert you. It auto-corrects the output before your user ever sees it.\n\nThink of it as spell-check for AI agents, running in production, in real time.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nThree layers. \n\nFirst, observation -- Vex watches every LLM call, tool use, and decision your agent makes. \n\nSecond, correction -- when something goes wrong, Vex blocks bad output and replaces it with a corrected response, mid-flight. \n\nThird, optimization -- Vex learns from every failure pattern and automatically tunes your agent's behavior over time.\n\n**Where we are:**\n\nVex is open source, Apache 2.0. Python and TypeScript SDKs are live. We have our first paying customer in production. We're onboarding more design partners this month and seeing strong pull from teams running multi-agent pipelines in production.",

Solo founder.\n\nProblem: 88% of business cards get trashed in a week. Digital card tools (Popl, HiHello, Blinq) fixed the card — but not what happens after. 48% of salespeople never follow up once. 80% of sales need 5+ touches. The gap between \"nice to meet you\" and \"deal closed\" is a graveyard.\n\nSolution: Vinc = digital card + native CRM + automated follow-up in one product. Tap the card → lead captured → intro email fires in 10 seconds → follow-up sequence runs → everything tracked. No Zapier. No manual entry. No leads lost to inertia.\n\nWhy it's different: Built on open-source ERP,  not stitched together from APIs. The CRM and automation are native, not bolted on. \n\nBusiness model: SaaS subscriptions + high-margin NFC hardware (dropship, zero inventory)\n\nAsk: Feedback, intros to enterprise pilots (real estate, sales orgs, events), early-stage investors into capital-efficient SaaS.\n\nHappy to demo.",

It scans ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI to see what they say when someone asks a buying question in your space.\n\nAfter scanning 50+ sites, here's what surprised me:\n\nMost businesses score below 30 out of 100. AI either doesn't mention them at all, or mentions competitors instead. The business owners had no idea.\n\nThe bigger problem is that these answers change constantly. A site that scored 70 last month can drop to 40 after a model update. Nobody's checking.\n\nWhat the tool actually does:\n\n* Scans all three major AI platforms for your domain\n* Shows you the exact questions where AI mentions competitors but not you\n* Generates fix pages — structured content that AI can actually parse and cite\n* Tells you which trust platforms (G2, Capterra, etc.) you need to get listed on\n* Weekly action plan so you know what to do next\n\nFree scan available. No signup, takes 10 seconds. You'll see your score across all three platforms.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h65mv1l7nujg1.png?width=2940&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a0cff2b507e40e92c496b7b24174f3bab33f4a6\n\nIf anyone here has a SaaS or local business, curious what you score.",

SO yeah it probably looks like rank tracking from the outside, but the idea is less about “ranking” and more about understanding how models talk about your category and giving founders feedback loops instead of guessing in the dark.",
