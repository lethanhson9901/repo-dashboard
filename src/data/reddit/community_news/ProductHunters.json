The default media engine is DirectShow which supports more advanced options such as frame interpolation, higher quality scalers, proper HDR support, etc.\n\nSome of the premium features include a much more modern and highly customizable user interface, a media library, browsing content and streaming from PLEX, Emby, Jellyfin media servers. TV/VOD streaming with EPG support (from a provider of your choice). Dual UI modes (Windowed and Home Theater) and much much more.\n\nOh... and me, a responsive developer who listens to what people wants and tries to act upon it (within what my resources as an Indie dev. allow).",

Just me, the code, and a belief that if the product is genuinely good, it can speak for itself.\n\nA few things I think helped this launch:\n\n  \n🎯**Extreme clarity in the tagline**\n\nI cut all the buzzwords. “Tab-to-complete everywhere” is it. If someone can’t understand what a product does in a couple seconds, they’re gone. Clarity beats cleverness every time.\n\n🙂 **Putting a face to it**\n\nSo many AI tools feel anonymous. I wanted the opposite. I showed my face in the demo and thumbnail because I want people to know there’s a real person behind this, and that I stand behind what I’m building.\n\n✨ **Treating design as trust**\n\nPeople decide fast. I spent a lot of time on the gallery images because screenshots are the first signal of quality. If it looks thoughtful and polished, people assume the product is too.\n\n\n\nI’ll be around in the comments, so happy to answer anything or hear what resonated.\n\n— Jared",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nWe launched **Echo** on Product Hunt today and wanted to share it here to get real, unfiltered feedback.\n\nEcho is a voice first notes app. You speak, it records, transcribes, summarizes, and lets you ask questions about what you said later. The goal is to make voice notes actually useful instead of turning into audio files you never revisit.\n\n**What Echo does:**\n\n* Records voice notes, meetings, or quick ideas\n* Automatically turns audio into text\n* Creates short summaries from long recordings\n* Lets you ask questions about past notes\n* Keeps everything searchable and organized\n\nWe built this because typing during meetings or when ideas hit feels slow and distracting. Voice is faster, but raw recordings are messy. Echo tries to close that gap by making voice structured and easy to work with.\n\nIf this sounds interesting, we are live on Product Hunt today and would really appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or criticism:  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/echo-35?launch=echo-fd149df1-a337-4f81-9665-8ff9e426ac4f](https://www.producthunt.com/products/echo-35?launch=echo-fd149df1-a337-4f81-9665-8ff9e426ac4f)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the product, the build process, or why we chose to focus on voice notes in the first place.",

Try focused community outreach where you answer threads with real value to build trust, run short targeted ads toward anxiety/sleep keywords to drive interested users, and collect quick in-app feedback prompts to iterate fast; each moves awareness, converts curious folks, and sharpens messaging. If scaling outreach becomes a headache you could try a service that finds Reddit posts asking for solutions and drafts founder style replies for your OK, would love feedback or to connect if you try it, and good luck with Plesso launch!",

          "text": "How are you measuring whether Hard Mode actually reduces doom scrolling? I'm a founder too and hated boring timers that felt robotic, so made something to help founders reach folks where they ask for help. Try adding a quick goal setup per session to make wins tangible, that can boost focus and retention, and run small community challenges for accountability to make sessions feel less lonely. I built SignalScouter, a founder led Reddit outreach service that can find posts where users seek solutions and reply founder style to cut through doom scrolling, it got 89 signups and 10k+ views in days, would love feedback or to connect if you try it, good luck with Focus Cab",

              "text": "Great question! Since Focus Cab is a privacy-first app, I don't track what users do outside the app. However, the measure of success is the **'Session Completion Rate'**. With Hard Mode (Screen Time API), the block is system-wide. So, if a user tries to doom-scroll, they literally can't open the app without killing their session and losing their progress. That friction is usually enough to break the loop. I like the idea of 'session goals' and 'community challenges'—definitely something I'm looking into for the roadmap. Congrats on SignalScouter, sounds like a solid tool for finding leads. Thanks for the feedback",

One feedback - when I have (in my stats page) a top scenario with two particular scenarios for equal time, in my case read and code, the top scenario section keeps flickering, you could consider adding a comma when theres a tie for the top spot.
