      "text": "Look, I know this isn't some $50k MRR flex... but hear me out.\n\nI see you grinding at 2 AM, convincing yourself that \"one more feature\" will finally get you customers. It won't.\n\nI wasted 6 months building shit nobody asked for before I realized something - as a solo founder stuck at $0, your problem isn't your product. It's everything else. Here's exactly what changed:\n\n**1. I Stopped \"Building\" and Started Talking**\n\nBig mistake: I spent 5 months coding in isolation thinking \"build it and they will come.\"\n\nThey didn't come.\n\nThen I forced myself to do something uncomfortable - I started cold messaging 50 people on LinkedIn every single day. Not copy-paste spam. Actually personalized messages to people who engage with top posts in my niche.\n\nResponse rate: 15-20%.\n\nThese people told me what they actually wanted. \n\nYour obsession with coding is just avoiding rejection.\n\n**2. Fuck Your Feature List**\n\nThis one hurt but... I deleted 7 features I spent weeks building.\n\nTurned out 3% of users ever clicked on them.\n\nStripped everything down to ONE thing: AI content that sounds like you, not ChatGPT.\n\nMade that 10x better instead of adding more mediocre features.\n\nYour feature bloat is killing you. Pick one thing and make it unfairly good.\n\n**3. The Pricing Move That Felt Insane**\n\nStarted at $19/month to \"compete\" with bigger tools at $39.\n\nConversion rate: 6%.\n\nThen I did something that felt stupid - raised it to $29/month.\n\nConversions went UP to 11%.\n\nPlus the customers who complained about the $10 difference:  \n  \nThey were going to be nightmare support tickets anyway.\n\nStop racing to the bottom.   \n  \nYour low price isn't helping you.\n\n**4. Reddit Became My Unfair Advantage**\n\nWhile everyone's trying to hack the algorithm on X, I did the most unsexy thing possible...\n\nWrote ONE valuable post per day on Reddit.   \n  \nNo promo links in the post. (Just let people ask)\n\nOne post drove 50+ qualified visitors. That's more than weeks of \"viral\" tweets with 50k impressions ever did.\n\nNow I repurpose that one post across 5-10 relevant subreddits.\n\nCost: $0. Time: 60 minutes per day.\n\n**5. SEO But Make It Actually Smart**\n\nEveryone told me: \"Write about LinkedIn growth tips!\"\n\nCool, I'd be competing with HubSpot, Neil Patel, and every marketing blog with DA 80+.\n\nI'd never rank.\n\nSo I went bottom-of-funnel instead:\n\n* \"Brandled vs \\[competitor\\]\" comparison pages\n* \"Best \\[competitor\\] alternatives\"\n* \"\\[competitor\\] review\"\n\nThese get 50-200 searches per month. But everyone searching is ready to buy.\n\nAnd I can actually rank for them.\n\nOne comparison page drives more revenue than 10 \"tips and tricks\" articles ever did.\n\n**6. I Stopped Pretending to Be a Big Company**\n\n**The Solo Founder's Actual Edge**\n\nYou can't outspend funded competitors. You can't out-hire them. You can't out-build them.\n\nBut you can out-care them.\n\nEvery customer gets a personal response from me. Every feature request gets a Loom video (even if it's a \"no\"). Every cancelled user gets a real email asking what I could've done better.\n\nBig companies can't do this. Their support team doesn't even know their founder.\n\nYou ARE the founder. That's your moat.\n\n**Why I Almost Quit (And Why You Shouldn't)**\n\nMonth 3: $0. Thought about quitting. Month 4: $0. Definitely thought about quitting. Month 5: $0. Wrote my \"I'm shutting down\" post. Month 6: Changed everything. Hit $126 in 4 days.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you: most founders quit right before things work.\n\nNot because their idea was bad. Because they ran out of patience.\n\nThe difference between $0 and $126 isn't talent. It's just refusing to quit when everything feels pointless.\n\n**The Truth About \"Making It\"**\n\nI'm not at $20k MRR. I'm not at $10k. I'm at $126.\n\nBut you know what? I went from \"this will never work\" to \"holy shit, people are actually paying me.\"\n\nThat mental shift is worth more than the money.\n\nBecause now I know the model works. Now it's just about repetition.\n\nKeep doing outreach. Keep writing content. Keep talking to users. Keep shipping.\n\n$126 becomes $500. $500 becomes $2k. $2k becomes $10k.\n\nBut only if you don't quit at $0.\n\nLook, I'm not some guru. I'm just a solo founder who wasted 6 months doing everything wrong.\n\nBut if you're stuck at $0 like I was, maybe my mistakes can save you some time.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share more details.\n\n(And yeah, the tool is Brandled - helps founders grow on LinkedIn & X without sounding like ChatGPT. But more importantly: just keep building. Most people quit right before it works.)",

The idea is simple: recognition is easier than recall. You don’t memorize strings, you recognize something personal.\n\nThe second controversial part: passwords are never stored.\nNot encrypted. Not hashed. Not in a vault.\n\nPasswords are regenerated on demand using cryptographic primitives, on-device checks and end-to-end encryption. If there’s a breach, there’s literally no password database to dump.\n\nThis raises a real question: If you were designing password security from scratch today, would you still use a master password at all?\n\nLooking forward to hearing honest takes… supportive or critical. 🙏🏻 \n",

          "text": "Cryptography and Security in Computing are quite complex sciences. Be careful of not making security claims if you cannot prove them. You don't want to be sued for false advertising in the event of a breach.\n\nFor instance, if you don't store passwords but store a way to re-generate them (a seed, an image, anything that allows you to to recognize the user and restore their passwords), you are indeed storing the passwords. Not in a plain-text or encrypted way, but in a \"function, argument\" pair. The function is how you generate the passwords (your algorithm), and the arguments are the URLs, images, user choices, etc.\n\nThe only way to not store passwords is to not store them. In which case, the user has to provide them, and hence your password manager has no functionality. It seems mathematically impossible for a password manager to not store the passwords.\n\nThen for the images: be careful of brute-force attacks. If you show 3 images to the user and they have to recognize which one is theirs, any attacker has a 1/3 probability of guessing right. Same, if the user has to take a photo of something personal, any attacker who guesses what that object is, or gets their hands on one of the past photos, will gain access to all the passwords. If you store the photos in an aim to implement \"you cannot use the same photo twice\", then any attacker stealing your photos gets access to the passwords of every user.\n\n**Complex stuff. I would recommend you don't do this.** Current password managers and 2FA tech comes out of government agencies, universities and big-budget companies (Microsoft, Google). There is a reason: you need a few post-doc level cryptographers working for several months or years to produce a password manager that does its job: don't lose the passwords, don't reveal them to anyone else but the user.",

quit.\n\nBut then I changed my approach and suddenly I hit $126 mrr within 4 days and linearly growing since than.\n\n# The real reason you're stuck at $0\n\nyou're not stuck because your product sucks or the market is saturated.\n\nyou're stuck because you're solving the wrong problem.\n\nthat problem isn't your product. it's your approach to getting the first dollar.\n\n# The psychology of $0 (and why it destroys you)\n\nwhen you're at $0, you have zero momentum.\n\nevery action feels pointless. your brain is literally wired to quit because it sees no evidence that effort leads to reward.\n\ni'd code for 12 hours thinking \"once this feature is done, product will be better than competitors and users will naturally come and pay.\" they didn't. so i'd add another feature and tried to perfect my tool. still $0.\n\nthe problem was i was trying to build momentum through building, when **building doesn't create momentum at $0.**\n\n**what actually creates momentum:**\n\n* talking to customers\n* making sales\n* getting rejected 50 times and learning from it\n\n# Why most founders fail\n\n97% of solo founders never break $10k mrr. not because they don't work hard. because they build their go-to-market strategy around their product instead of their customer's buying journey.\n\n**you think:** \"my tool saves 10 hours per week, so people will obviously pay $29/month.\"\n\n**reality:** people buy when they're actively looking for a solution right now.\n\ni wasted months writing \"how to grow on linkedin\" blog posts trying to rank for high traffic keywords.\n\nrevenue driven: zero.\n\nthen i wrote comparison pages. \"brandled vs taplio.\" \"best hypefury alternatives.\"\n\nthese get 50-200 searches per month. but everyone searching is literally in buying mode right now.\n\n# The $0 to $1 playbook\n\nforget \"building an audience\" for now. at $0, you need proof that someone will pay you.\n\n**Step 1: find where your customers are making buying decisions**\n\nnot where they hang out. where they're actively solving the problem you solve.\n\n**for me:** linkedin and x posts where top creators share content tips. commenters are my exact customers.\n\nspend 2 hours finding 5-10 of these places. that's your entire market for the next month.\n\n**Step 2: have 50 real conversations (not pitches)**\n\ni sent 50 personalized messages per day.\n\nresponse rate: 15-20%. half led nowhere. the other half told me exactly what people would pay for.\n\nhere's the key: you're not selling. you're validating. ask things like:\n\n\"what's the most annoying part of \\[their problem\\]?\"\n\n\"how are you solving this now?\"\n\n\"if you could wave a magic wand, what would the perfect solution look like?\"\n\nthese conversations tell you what to build and who will actually pay.\n\n**Step 3: build based on feedback (not competition)**\n\nnow that you've validated the idea, it's time to build.\n\nbut you don't have to build a better product than your competitors.\n\n**you just have to build one core feature that's 10x better.**\n\nthat's it.\n\nmax time you should spend here: one week.\n\nresist the urge to add \"just one more feature.\" ship it.\n\n**Step 4: build a system that compounds daily**\n\nnow you need to systematize how you got those customers so you can repeat it every single day.\n\n**my daily system:**\n\n**distribution:**\n\n* document my journey on x and linkedin (i use brandled, but you can do it manually)\n* outreach to warm leads (people who reply to tweets or engage with you, message them like a friend and offer a trial)\n* write one valuable reddit post (value first, not product first)\n* publish one high-intent blog article (comparison/alternative/review pages)\n\n**product:**\n\n* improve existing features based on user feedback\n* fix bugs and issues users report\n* only build new features if users are desperately asking AND it's a no-brainer\n\n**operations:**\n\n* one-on-one call with every user on day 7 of their trial\n* email everyone who cancels or goes quiet, ask for honest feedback\n* use that feedback to improve onboarding or product\n\nthis isn't glamorous. but it's systematic customer acquisition.\n\n# Why most founders optimize the wrong thing\n\n**the only question that matters at this stage:** \"how do i get someone to pay me this week?\"\n\nat $0, spend **80% of your time on distribution and talking with users** and 20% building what they'll pay for.\n\nnot the other way around.\n\n# What to do tomorrow\n\nif you're at $0 right now:\n\n**day 1:** stop building features. close your code editor.\n\n**day 2-3:** spend 3 hours finding where your customers discuss their problems.\n\n**day 4-7:** send 20-50 personalized messages daily. just conversations, not pitches.\n\nby end of week, you'll have talked to 100 people.\n\n# The hard truth\n\n**your job at $0 isn't to be a developer. your job is to be a salesperson who can code.**\n\nonce you make that mental shift, being stuck at $0 becomes impossible.\n\nI’m not at $10k mrr now. not life changing. but i went from \"this will never work\" to \"holy shit this actually works.\"\n\nnow i know the playbook. talk to customers. build what they'll pay for. repeat.\n\ni'm documenting everything as i build brandled to $10k mrr minimum. not the highlight reel. the real shit.\n\nif you're stuck at $0, i hope this helps. happy to answer questions.\n\n  \n",

      "text": "Hey, I went into SaaS last year with my tool Brandled (helps founders grow on X & LinkedIn) in a pretty competitive space with $0 and 0 audience and ended up wasting six months straight on the wrong things.\n\nSpent half a year stuck at $0 MRR.\n\nThen I became obsessed with one question: what separates SaaS products that make it from those that die at zero.\n\nSo I went down a rabbit hole. Studied 47 founders who went from $0 to $10k+ MRR in the last year. Watched their podcasts, red their tweets, and everything i could get my hands on.\n\nHere's what I learned from all of them, and what I was doing catastrophically wrong.\n\n**1. Frictionless signup isn't optional**\n\nEvery successful product had one-click social login. Google OAuth mostly.\n\nThe ones that died had email verification flows, password requirements, multi-step forms asking questions before showing any value.\n\nThe math is brutal. If you lose 30% of people at signup and you're getting 1000 visitors a month, that's 300 potential customers gone. At a 10% trial-to-paid conversion, that's 30 paying customers per month lost to signup friction alone.\n\nI started with magic link only. Completion rate was 45%. Added Google login. Jumped to 78% the next day.\n\nEvery percentage point of friction at signup costs you real revenue. Most founders don't even measure this.\n\n**2. They launched in weeks, not months**\n\nNone of them spent 6 months building in secret.\n\nAverage time from idea to first paying customer: 3-6 weeks. They launched with ONE core feature. Then spent most of their time marketing it.\n\nI did the opposite. Spent 3 months building features before launching. Content generation, analytics, scheduling, competitor tracking, everything. Got 12 signups. Zero paying customers.\n\nConvinced myself the product wasn't good enough. Spent another month adding features. Still nothing.\n\nThe problem wasn't my product. Nobody knew it existed.\n\nAfter I stopped building and started marketing, posting on Reddit, doing LinkedIn outreach, documenting on X, I hit $126 MRR in 4 days.\n\nSame product. Different approach.\n\nPost-launch is 90% marketing, 10% product.\n\n**3. They were shameless about promotion**\n\nThe successful ones talked about their product everywhere. Not spammy. Just never hiding it.\n\nReddit threads. Twitter replies. Forum comments. Anywhere their audience hung out.\n\nThey'd give genuinely helpful advice first, then naturally mention their tool when relevant.\n\nStarted being shameless. Every relevant conversation where someone complained about the problem I solved, I'd help them first, then mention I built something for this.\n\nA few people definitely get mad but I feel the upside is worth it.\n\nYour product won't discover itself.\n\n**4. They asked churned users what went wrong**\n\nEvery successful product had a system for this. Automated email going out when someone cancels asking what didn't work.\n\nI was doing none of this. Saw cancellations in Stripe, felt rejected, moved on. Never asked why. Never learned anything.\n\nNow every cancelled user gets emails through and automated email sequence and the replies are done by me personally.\n\nResponse rate is 40%. The feedback is literally gold.\n\nEvery single one is fixable. But I only learned because I asked.\n\nChurned users tell you the real truth about your product.\n\n**5. They used their own product religiously**\n\nNot one successful founder was building something they didn't use daily. They were their own heaviest users.\n\nI wasn't doing this. Used my tool occasionally to \"test\" but wasn't relying on it daily.\n\nForced myself to create all my content through my own product for a week. Found 7 bugs in 30 minutes that never showed up in testing.\n\nGenerate button didn't work on mobile. Analytics took 8 seconds to load. Onboarding skipped steps if you refreshed.\n\nMy users were experiencing this and not telling me. They were just leaving.\n\nIf you're not using your product daily as a real user, you're building blind.\n\n**6. They fixed retention before scaling acquisition**\n\nBiggest strategic difference.\n\nFailed products: 30-50% monthly churn, constantly chasing new users to replace ones leaving.\n\nSuccessful products: Fixed retention first, got churn to 10-20%, then scaled acquisition.\n\nThe math: At 40% churn, you acquire 40 customers to net 24. At 15% churn, you acquire 40 and net 34. Same effort, 42% better results.\n\nI was obsessed with new signups. Ignored my 40% churn rate. Got 10 new customers, lost 4. Net: 6.\n\nStopped all acquisition. Fixed onboarding from 8 steps to 3. Added email sequences. Built features retained users asked for. Churn dropped to 15%.\n\nSame acquisition effort, now net 8-9 customers instead of 6.\n\nRetention is the foundation. Acquisition is the multiplier.\n\n**7. They shipped MVPs with one feature**\n\nEvery successful product launched stupidly lean. One core feature done exceptionally well.\n\nI launched with 7 features: content generation, analytics, scheduling, competitor tracking, SWOT, comments, hashtags.\n\nCodebase was a nightmare. Users were confused. I was maintaining features 3% of users touched.\n\nShould've launched with one thing: AI content that sounds human. Made that 10x better. Everything else later based on what paying customers asked for.\n\nYour MVP should make people say \"this solves my exact problem\" even if ugly and missing features.\n\nNot \"wow, so many features\" while solving nothing particularly well.\n\n**8. They priced based on value, not competition**\n\nNone of them raced to the bottom on pricing.\n\nThey looked at the value delivered. Hours saved. Revenue generated. Pain eliminated.\n\nThen priced a fraction of that value.\n\nI priced at $19/month because competitors were at $29-39. Thought I'd win on price. Just looked cheap and inferior.\n\nNeeded 263 customers to hit $5k MRR at $19 versus only 128 at $39.\n\nRaised price to $29-39. Conversions didn't drop. They improved slightly.\n\nHigher price signaled solving a valuable problem.\n\nPeople who care about $10 differences aren't your best customers. They'll churn for anything $3 cheaper.\n\n**9. They automated relationship building**\n\nEvery successful product had email sequences from day one. Not promotional. Actual value and engagement.\n\nWelcome emails. Feature education. Check-ins. Re-engagement for quiet users. Win-back for churned users.\n\nI was sending nothing after signup. Users signed up, got busy, forgot, churned.\n\nEngagement doesn't happen by accident. You engineer it.\n\n**10. They validated with money, not words**\n\nThe problem with feedback: it's free. People say nice things because it costs them nothing.\n\nI built features based on \"that would be helpful\" comments from users who weren't even paying. Wasted weeks on features nobody used.\n\nNow I only build what paying customers explicitly request.\n\nMoney is the only validation that matters. Words are cheap. Credit card numbers are truth.\n\n**The one thing they all had**\n\nThey didn't quit when it felt hopeless.\n\nThey all hit $0 for months. Got depressed. Questioned everything. Wanted to shut it down.\n\nBut didn't.\n\nThe difference between $0 and success wasn't talent or luck. It was not quitting before they figured out what works.\n\n90% of SaaS products die not because they couldn't work. Because the founder quit too early.\n\nIf you're stuck at $0, study the people who've made it. Not the outliers. The normal founders who went from $0 to $10k.\n\nThey're not special. They just did specific things that compound and didn't quit when it got hard.\n\nThe playbook is right there. You just have to execute it.\n\nHappy to answer questions or go deeper on any of this.",

      "text": "Hey everyone👋\n\nSuper excited to share that Atoms just went live on Product Hunt. This update might be one of the biggest leaps for AI builders this year.\n\nAtoms is not just another AI coding assistant. Atoms acts like a complete AI software team, with architects, developers, and researchers all working together to take your idea from concept to a fully running product.\n\n* **End-to-end app creation:** You describe what you want, and Atoms breaks it down, plans it, codes it, and ships a running full-stack app.\n* **Multi-agent collaboration:** Different AI agents specialize in research, coding, debugging, or design, and they actually collaborate in real time.\n* **Deep Research:** Before any code is written, Iris does in-depth research, comparing frameworks, APIs, and architectures.\n* **Best of N (Race Mode) :** Atoms runs multiple versions of your task in parallel and picks the best performing one automatically.\n* **Multi-language and mobile optimized:** Sites run fast on mobile and adapt to multiple languages natively.\n* **Reusable backend templates with full backend capabilities:** Atoms now ships backend templates that are production-level, not demos. It's basically giving you a reusable backend foundation you can extend, saving days of setup.\n\nIf you've ever used tools like Lovable, Bolt, or Relevance AI, this feels like the next step, more engineering team and less AI toy. You can literally build an MVP or startup prototype without switching tools halfway.\n\nAtoms is live today on Product Hunt, and I'd love to know what you think of it:\n\n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/atoms-2](https://www.producthunt.com/products/atoms-2)\n\nIf you're into AI agents, multi-agent systems, or the next-gen dev workflow, it's definitely worth checking out.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and feedback. I'm curious if others are seeing the same AI team feel I did!\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qbpdqf/video/4buukz5lt3dg1/player\n\n",

      "text": "When we launched on Product Hunt, one of the biggest lessons wasn’t about traffic or upvotes, it was about timing and financial readiness. Launching takes more time and energy than expected, and if your runway isn’t clear, that pressure becomes very real very fast.\n\nWhile working on **Startup Runway**, a tool focused on helping founders calculate runway and plan cash properly, we saw firsthand how many teams launch without really knowing how long they can sustain momentum after launch. It’s easy to focus on visibility and ignore the financial side until it becomes urgent.\n\nThe experience reinforced that a launch isn’t just a marketing moment. It’s a financial decision too. Knowing your burn rate and how much room you have to experiment changes how confidently you show up and engage with the community.\n\nI’m curious for those who’ve launched on Product Hunt, did you feel financially prepared going in, or did you figure things out as you went?",
