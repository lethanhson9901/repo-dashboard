You can even upload your own knowledge base, customize everything, and shape the book exactly how you want it.  \n  \nIf this sounds interesting, I'd be incredibly grateful if you could check it out and support our launch.  \n  \nProduct Hunt link:  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/aivolut-books](https://www.producthunt.com/products/aivolut-books)  \n  \nAnd if you're launching something soon too (Product Hunt or anywhere else), DM me or drop your link - more than happy to support you back.  \n  \nThank you all so much",

My recent experience with Product Hunt.  \nSo - if you are an early stage founder - should you \\[not\\]launch on Product Hunt?   \nIt depends.  \nNot on your product.  \nOn your goal.  \n  \nAfter launching [modaal.dev](http://modaal.dev) \\[ business grade ios apps on Swift with AI\\] -  this week, my conclusion is simple:  \nProduct Hunt is mostly a re-engagement engine - not a discovery engine.  \n  \n1) If your goal is re-engagement → launch.  \nPH is great when you already have:  \nan audience  \ncustomers  \na network  \nBecause the real PH loop is:  \nYou ship → you email / post / DM → your people show up → they engage → you re-activate the market around you.  \nSo yes — if you’re Miro / Mistral AI / Vercel / Webflow **-**level, Product Hunt is perfect. \\[that's exactly who played yesterday\\]  \n  \n2) If your goal is new users → usually don’t overinvest.  \nIf you want fresh leads or new early adopters, PH is often a weak time → outcome bet.  \nUnless you’re a very broad product that “anyone wish/can try fast”.   \nExample: whispeflow  \n  \n3) The evolution of Product Hunt nobody likes to say out loud  \nI’ve been watching PH for \\~7 years.  \nIt evolved from:  \nindie makers shipping MVPs  \ninto:  \nbig companies shipping features  \nAnd that’s fine.  \nIt’s just a different game now.  \nBut if your goal is: “I want the world’s early adopters to discover me”…  \nPH is no longer the best place to bet your time.  \n  \n4) The uncomfortable reality about ranking  \nWant #1?  \nOn average you need 300–600 upvotes for this.  \nBig companies can do it with their built-in reach.  \nSmall teams have 2 options:  \n\\* accept a realistic rank (still valuable)  \nor \\* pay (and that usually means low-quality voting)  \nYes, vote services is service.  \nMarket reality: 300–500 votes can cost \\~$3–5k.  \nIt may buy you a good screenshot. It rarely buys you users.  \n  \n5) My launch results (and why I’m happy)  \nI sent \\~600 personal messages.  \nWe got 218 votes.  \nWe got 5 very interesting VC/Angel convos leads.  \nAnd I call it a success.  \nBecause my goal wasn’t installs or #1.  \n  \nMy goal was:  \nawareness inside my circle + credibility in the exact communities where my product belongs. For that → PH worked. For me.  \n  \nMy wish  \nI hope vibecoding tools like Lovable / Bolt / v0 by Vercel Base44 create a new “maker arena” again — a place where brand-new products can be showcased and get first adopters without competing with enterprise feature drops.  \n",

We are launching **Supaboard AI** on Product Hunt today, and when I opened the leaderboard this morning I genuinely laughed: we’re basically “competing” for attention on the same day / feed as **Vercel, GitHub, and Webflow**.\n\nObviously we’re not pretending we’re that size — but it’s a pretty wild reminder of what Product Hunt is: one page where a tiny product can show up beside giants, and you still get a shot at being noticed if your story and value are clear.\n\nSince most people here launch on PH (or want to), I thought of sharing my two cents of what we are doing that is helping us get moving:\n\n* **Tight one-liner > long pitch.** We rewrote our tagline to be instantly understandable to someone who is scrolling through.\n* **Ask for feedback, not “upvotes.”** People are way more willing to help when you’re genuinely asking “what’s unclear?”\n* **Have a “comment plan.”** Engagement in the comment section, matters more than people think. That's why, we had everyone in the office reply fast to every question/comment.\n* **DMs > mass posting.** The best support came from personal messages to builders who’ve launched before (and we offered to return the favor on their day).\n\nIf you’re open to helping: I’d love honest feedback on the PH page (what’s confusing / what would make you bounce). And if you think it’s worthy, an upvote really helps us survive the “Vercel/GitHub/Webflow” gravity today.\n\nPH Link: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/supaboard-ai](https://www.producthunt.com/products/supaboard-ai)\n\nAlso — if you’re launching soon, drop your link and your launch date. I’ll support you on your day, and if you want, I can share the exact outreach/comment checklist we used. 🙌",

      "text": "First UP, I didn't went from idea to $1300 in 28 days.\n\nFor the first three months I didn't knew that you have to market your product too.\n\nI just kept building.\n\nThen when I had 0 users after having a brutally failed PH launch.\n\nI just went down on researching on how apps really grow from \"0\"\n\nWatched endless starter story videos, reddit threads, podcasts, articles and what not.\n\nThen finally formulated a marketing strategy and went all in on it since 1st January.\n\nIt's been a month now since going all in on [my SaaS](https://brandled.app/) and I now have 35 paying users or about $1.3k in MRR\n\nIt's not millions but atleast a proof that my stuff is working.\n\nNow here's what worked:\n\n1. **Building in public to get initial traction:** I got my first users by posting on X (build in public and startup communities). I would post my wins, updates, lessons learned, and the occasional meme. In the beginning you only need a few users and every post/reply gives you a chance to reach someone.\n2. **Warm DMs:** Nope I didn't blasted thousands of cold dms and messages instead I engaged with my ICPs posts and content and then warm dm them asking them to try out my product and give me some feedback (this was the biggest growth lever)\n3. **Word of mouth:** I always spend most of my time improving the product. My goal is to surprise users with how good the product is, and that naturally leads to them recommending the product to their friends. More than 1/3 of my paying customers come from word of mouth.\n4. **SEO:** I went into SEO from day 1, not targeting broad keywords and instead focussed on Bottom of Funnel keywords (alternatives pages, reviews pages, comparision pages), it basically allows you to steal traffic from your competitors\n5. **Removing all formatting from my emails:** I thought emails that use company branding felt impersonal and that must impact how many people actually read them. After removing all formatting from my emails my open rate almost doubled. Huge win.\n\n**What didn’t work:**\n\n**1. Building free tools:** The tools that received most traffic are usually pretty generic (posts downloader, video extractor etc.) so the audience is pretty cold and it's almost impossible to convert them\n\n**2. Affiliate system:** I’ve had an affiliate system live for months now and I get a ton of applications but it’s extremely rare that an affiliate will actually follow through on their plans. 99% get 0 sign ups.\n\n**3. Building features no one wants (obviously):** I’ve wasted a few weeks here and there when I built out features that no one really wanted. I strongly recommend you to talk to your users and really try to understand them before building out new features.\n\nNext steps:\n\nDoing more of what works. I’m not going to try any new marketing channels until I’m doing my current ones really well. And I will continue spending most of my time improving product (can’t stress how important this has been).\n\nAlso working on a big update but won’t talk about that yet.\n\nBest of luck founders!",

That 'proof of concept' feeling is better than any lottery win.\n\nyour point about removing email formatting is such an underrated gem. People underestimate how much a plain-text email feels like a real conversatin rather than a marketing blast. Also, 'stealing' competitor traffic via BoFu keywords (alternatives pages) is a top-tier move for a 28-day sprint.\n\ndon't sweat the PH launch - most of us have ben there.It’s the consistent daily distribution that builds the empire.

Also you need to maintain result schema (like json structure with filled answers from llms) that moves through your pipeline. It can be also done async in queue/ event bus architecture.",

I used exactly zero of them to write anything.\n\nThe problem wasn't finding good content — it was actually turning it into something I could publish without starting from scratch every time.\n\nSo I built a small Chrome extension for myself.\n\nIt's a Chrome extension that works directly inside Twitter. You save tweets or full threads with one click, it captures the engagement metrics (views, likes, RTs), and organizes everything into lists.\n\nThen you can:\n\n* **Generate new tweets or threads with AI** — based on the viral posts you saved.\n* **Export everything to Markdown** if you want to use it elsewhere.\n* **Build a personal library** of what actually works in your niche.\n\nIt's not a scheduler. It's not a generic AI writer. It's a way to turn the content you already consume into content you can publish.\n\nJust launched it on Product Hunt today: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/ghostframe](https://www.producthunt.com/products/ghostframe)\n\nIf you write on Twitter and you're tired of the blank page problem, I'd appreciate you checking it out.\n\nHappy to answer questions.",

A simple “idea inbox” view with filters by niche + engagement bands (e.g., 1–10k likes, 10–100k) would help pick the right source for the right day. \n\n\n\nOn the research side, I bounce between Typefully and Hypefury, and use Pulse for Reddit mostly to mine real questions and language that I then mirror in Twitter hooks, so a tight capture/remix loop like this really matters.",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’ve spent the last two months promoting my project on Reddit. Went viral, got removed by moderators, and everything in between.\n\nHere’s a recap of what I did, what works, and what doesn’t:\n\n* **Launch posts (work)**: there are a ton of communities that let you showcase your product without getting banned, I made a list of subreddits with my target audience -> read the community guidelines on self-promotion -> checked if they have a dedicated flair or a designated day (usually on Saturday) -> shared my product. The first time it didn’t get any views/upvotes but I continued working on the copy until I found one that goes viral regularly. My best tips?\n   1. *Match the tone of the community*: this is what makes the difference between going viral and getting ignored (or banned).\n   2. *Subreddit size doesn’t matter that much*: people ignore smaller communities, but I had the same post go viral in a 95K subreddit and in a 9.5K one and got nearly the same visits to my project.\n   3. *Let Reddit help you*: if you’re struggling to find subreddits that match your product go to Reddit ads page -> setup your account -> click \"create campaign\" -> insert keywords related to your product and Reddit will auto suggest the most relevant subreddits.\n* **Shameless plugs (work, but probably I shouldn’t say it)**: general advice to write a comment to promote your product is something along the lines of *\"I had the same problem last year. Tried a bunch of solutions but found \\[tool\\] worked best for my use case. The key was \\[specific feature\\]. Went from \\[before state\\] to \\[after state\\] in about \\[timeframe\\]\"*. That’s a lot of work and not always needed. If your product is a direct answer to the question just share it, but make sure to disclose you’re the founder (proof: one of my shameless plugs got 25 upvotes and a couple hundred visitors to my project).\n* **“What are you building?” posts (don’t work)**: I’ve shared my project in a few “what are you building” posts. Results? Crickets. People are there to write comments, not to read the comments.\n* **Tracking conversations (works)**: I regularly track the visitors coming from reddit and their conversion rates. I don’t always have the time to leave a reply but just scrolling trought the comments helps me better understand users (I’ve already stolen a couple of ideas to improve my copy). If you have no idea about what to track, start with competitor mentions, keywords related to the problem/pain point you solve, or mentions of specific features.\n* **DMs (don’t scale)**: I’m not really a fan of DMs, Reddit is great at getting views and moving the conversation in 1vs1 won’t get you any. They only make sense when you fear your comment could be downvoted into oblivion.\n* **Content Strategy (not sure)**: I’ve shared me journey or growth experiments or just posts I thought would be interesting for my audience. (7 months of \"vibe coding\" a SaaS and here's what nobody tells you, You WILL Reach $10K MRR (If You Follow This Simple SaaS Routine),I studied 47 SaaS products that went from 0 to 10k MRR last year. Here's what they all did right),\n* for context my project is a [saas tool](https://brandled.app/) sometimes adding a link at the end or a softfer CTA inviting to check out my project. Some got a few thousand views, others were so bad that they didn’t even get AI-generated comments. However, none of them brought a significant spike in visitors (probably a skill issue on my side).\n\nThere you have it, nothing fancy, nothing controversial. This strategy got me 550k+ impressions in my first month.\n\nI’d love to hear if you’ve tried something similar or if you have other tips on marketing on Reddit.",
