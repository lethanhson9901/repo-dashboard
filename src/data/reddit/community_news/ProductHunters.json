      "text": "I’ve been sitting on this for months. Kept telling myself I’d do it “when it’s ready” or “when I feel more confident”. Today I just stopped thinking and posted it on Product Hunt.\n\nResult so far: 7 upvotes, zero users.\n\nI don’t really know how I feel about it yet. Part of me is disappointed. Part of me is relieved. Mostly I just feel… less tense than I did yesterday.\n\nThis is my second company and I think the first one failing made me overthink everything this time. Launching felt like opening myself up to judgement again, which is probably why I kept delaying it.\n\nI don’t know if anything will come from this launch. It might be nothing. But at least it’s out there now, and I’m not hiding from it anymore.\n\nFor people who’ve been through this, what did you do *after* your first quiet launch day? Did you push harder, change direction, or just let it sit for a bit?\n\nNot promoting anything. Just sharing where I’m at.\n\n[Link](https://www.producthunt.com/products/inbox-party/) for anyone curious.",

      "text": "TrendEdge pulls in Reddit and all social sentiment in real time, mixes it with stuff like insider trades and macro events, and gives you a 1-10 score on momentum potential. We've been running it since early 2024, and the alerts line up with actual moves: NVDA scored a 9/10 and went up 124% after, PLTR hit 8/10 for 87%, and SMCI's 9/10 led to 156% in a few months. Everything's timestamped and public so you can check it yourself.\n\nThe new mock trading part is what I'm excited about. You can set up a mock portfolio right in the platform - pick stocks based on our signals and data, decide your position size and stops, and see how it plays out with alerts if sentiment shifts or price hits your levels. It ties back to the exact data that triggered the trade, so you learn what works without any real risk.\n\nTraders tell me it helps cut down on noise and build better habits, like using stops instead of guessing. \n\nWe're live on Product Hunt today, so if you trade momentum or follow Reddit chatter, an upvote, comment or quick trial would mean a lot. \n\nHere's the page: [TrendEdge](https://www.producthunt.com/products/trendedge?utm_source=other&utm_medium=social)   \n  \nThank you!\n\n",

Different approach tho, we focus more on alerts when things cross thresholds rather than scoring. Use my API to validate your data if you want 😛\n\nGood luck on PH! 🚀​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I learned a lot, but I also carry that weight.\n\nFor the last 6 months, I’ve been coding a new product alone. No audience. No hype. No waitlist. Just me, my laptop, and way too much time to overthink.\n\nAnd now my brain is doing this fun thing where it keeps asking:\n\n* What if nobody signs up?\n* What if I built something nobody actually needs?\n* What if launching makes it “real”, and real means rejection?\n\nSome days I’m confident.  \nOther days I’m like… who even needs another lead gen tool? Why did I think *this* was a good idea?\n\nI didn’t think this through perfectly. I didn’t have a big plan. I just kept building because stopping felt worse.\n\nSo yeah, I don’t know if I should post about my tool.  \nI don’t know what will happen when I post on PH.  \nI don’t even know if I’ll get my first real user.\n\nBut I do know this: hiding forever guarantees nothing happens.\n\nPosting this mostly to say, if you’re also scared, spiralling, or sitting on something unfinished and judging yourself for it… you’re not alone.\n\nIf you’ve launched while feeling like this, I’d genuinely love to hear how it went.  \nEven if it flopped.\n\nThanks for reading. 🙏\n\nUpdate Guys: Thanks a lot for all the motivation, I finally did it - launching on PH in 1.5 hours\n\nI did it: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/inbox-party?utm\\_source=other&utm\\_medium=social](https://www.producthunt.com/products/inbox-party?utm_source=other&utm_medium=social)\n\nPlease upvote 🙏🙏",

A lot of PH launches stall because people treat launch day as the marketing plan.\n\nIf you want a quick next step, I would turn your best demo into 3-5 short clips and start posting them daily for a couple weeks (same hook, different angles). It compounds way better than one big announcement.\n\nAlso worth picking one ICP to start (ops teams at small agencies, CS teams, etc.) so your messaging lands.\n\nI have a small list of early SaaS marketing plays that might help after the PH push: https://www.promarkia.com\n\nGood luck this week.",

I mean you can also save your to-do‘s, habits, calender etc. on the Notes app in your mobile device but most people dont, because they want to keep a good structure and dont mix the purpose of apps with other ones. Correct me if im wrong.",

Imagine \n\nWe built Imagine because we believe software creation shouldn’t be limited to people who already know how to code, set up infrastructure, or glue together dozens of tools just to get something working.\n\nWith Imagine, you can go from an idea to a real product in minutes, whether that’s a prototype, a landing page, an internal tool, or a full app you want to share with the world. Just describe what you want to build, and Imagine helps you create real working products.\n\n**Imagine is the alternative to Lovable, Supabase, and Vercel, in a single platform.**  \nThat means **no need to**:\n\n\\- Integrate multiple vendors  \n\\- Manage multiple subscriptions  \n\\- Worry about security across a scattered stack  \n  \nWith Imagine, you can go from **prompt → working app**, and still have the fundamentals builders care about: a real backend, real data, real auth, real deployments, without the glue code and setup overhead.\n\nImagine is built on top of Appwrite’s cloud infrastructure, so it’s designed for builders who want to move fast, but still want things like security, scalability, and production-ready foundations from day one.\n\nWe’d love your feedback. We’re here all day to help you answer any questions!\n\nLearn more on our PH launch page:   \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/imagine-2](https://www.producthunt.com/products/imagine-2)",

But lately, I see more and more founders launching products themselves as Makers.\n\nMy question to those who launched recently: Does having a Hunter actually impact your visibility or ranking today? Or has the algorithm changed enough that self-hunting is just as effective?\n\nI would prefer to post it myself to share my personal story, but I don't want to miss out on potential distribution if Hunters still carry extra weight.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!",

That assumption didn’t hold up.\n\nLately, instead of brainstorming or running discovery calls, I’ve been studying what already works. I spent time going through StartupIdeas-DB which I found on google, looking only at products that were already live and making money.\n\nOne of those ideas stuck with me enough that I’m now actively building something inspired by it. What’s funny is how plain it looked at first glance. No hype. No vision-heavy positioning. Just a very specific problem and a group of users willing to pay to make it go away.\n\nThat alone answered the validation question. Once people are paying, the conversation shifts. It’s no longer about whether the idea works, it’s about whether you can execute better, focus tighter, or distribute smarter.\n\nI still see value in talking to users, but I’ve found those conversations often surface opinions, not urgency. Payment is a much clearer signal. These days, when I evaluate ideas, I don’t ask whether they sound impressive.  \n  \nI ask whether someone is already paying for a solution. More often than not, the best ideas aren’t flashy. They’re obvious, boring, and already proven.\n\nHow do you usually validate, through conversations, or through existing revenue?",

Our first product grew through organic channels and reached a stable user base without ever doing a launch, so we are now feeling \"newbies\" when it comes to the PH ritual. I’m curious to know what specifically makes a PH launch worth the effort for you—is it the community validation, the feedback, or something else entirely?\n\nWe are also trying to figure out which pre-launch preparations are truly essential and what post-launch actions actually help with long-term growth. In your honest opinion, what does the actual success of a launch depend on most, and are there common pitfalls that people usually overlook? Is it quite effective?

PH is great for compressed feedback + visibility in a very specific crowd (makers, early adopters, loud opinions), but it rarely translates into sustained growth on its own unless you already have momentum or distribution lined up.\n\nThe launches I’ve seen work best treat PH less like a growth hack and more like a stress test. Tight positioning, a clear *aha* in the first 10 seconds, and being super active in comments matter way more than fancy pre-launch checklists. Biggest pitfall IMO is expecting PH to validate the business… it mostly validates your messaging and timing.",

You can log mileage manually from the odometer or via GPS, see the route on a map, and track fuel plus a basic “fuel balance” based on your car’s average consumption. No account, no ads, no subscription. Data stays on your device.\n\nIf anyone feels like taking a quick look, I’d really appreciate blunt feedback on the app itself: what feels confusing, clunky, or missing in the first couple minutes?\n\nPH link: [DriveLog - Mileage Tracker](https://www.producthunt.com/products/drivelog-mileage-tracker-gps-fuel?utm_source=other&utm_medium=social)",

But even with organized notes, I often feel like I’m starting from scratch every time I revisit a topic. I’ve tried RSS feeds, bookmarking systems, and spreadsheets to track sources, but maintaining continuity still feels impossible.\n\nInformation is fragmented and constantly evolving. New research, news, and discussions appear daily, and I can’t realistically check every source manually. By the time I do, I’ve already lost the context from the previous week, so I end up re-learning the same things over and over. It’s mentally exhausting and feels like wasted time instead of building knowledge.\n\nRecently, I started using nbot ai, a tool I found on Product Hunt. It tracks topics continuously instead of giving one-off results, automatically summarizes changes, highlights important updates, and keeps a persistent knowledge base. Essentially, it remembers what I’ve already learned so I don’t have to. I’ve only been using it for a few weeks, but it’s already saved me hours and made my understanding feel much more coherent.",
