I’ve seen too many stories like \"raised $700K pre-seed → burned through it → now stressed out trying to raise again.\" Meanwhile, I just fix bugs, ship small features, talk to customers and grow at my own pace.\n\nWith micro SaaS, you can get to $5K–$20K MRR with high margins, no pressure and total control over your time. You don’t need a team of 20 or a slide deck for every decision. Just a useful product, a few customers who pay and a feedback loop that actually works.\n\nWould love to hear from others building solo or small- how’s it going for you? And if you’re still debating startup vs micro SaaS, happy to share more behind the scenes if helpful",

It's actually a bit of a vibe really. Knowing that you can technically stop whenever and still have cash coming in. The problem is when you raise early, that's a lot of pressure for zero to non-existent traction. I feel like it's bullshit for anyone that says they found pmf pre-seed or seed or that they achieved $1M ARR in X months. It's kind of the saying from 20VC podcast where it's not about how quick you get to your first  1 or 5 million arr but the time it takes to go from 0 to 50. That's where you can say you found pmf. So coming back to the point is I would agree that $10K MRR feels much better than $2m seed because it's 100% your cash, working for yourself, and no vc's pressuring you. That's just my take at least.",

We wanted something *different* — something that really understands the lived experience of chronic illness. So we built Juno: an AI clinical specialist you can talk to daily about symptoms, sleep, medications and more — and she automatically tracks everything and spots connections you might miss.\n\n🔹 Built on real research: 1,000+ patient interviews and Oxford-level insights  \n🔹 Meaningful tracking: Juno links patterns over time (e.g., new meds → symptoms)  \n🔹 Actionable insights: Users have used her insights to get earlier diagnoses  \n🔹 Loved by users: 20k+ downloads, 400+ 5-star reviews in 3 months\n\nWe’re launching on Product Hunt today — and would *really* appreciate your support. If you or someone you know lives with a chronic condition (or cares for someone who does), Juno is designed for you.\n\n👇 Upvote and share your thoughts here:  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/juno-13?launch=juno-12](https://www.producthunt.com/products/juno-13?launch=juno-12&utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’ve spent the last two months trying to grow on X(twitter) and use it to promote my product.\n\nHere’s a recap of what I did, what works, and what doesn’t:\n\n• **0 Followers SETUP:** If you're starting out with 0 followers and even if you write the best piece of content out there you'll not get any results. Here's what to **do first:**\n\n1. **Buy X premium (ASAP)**, it's just 8 bucks and not only X boosts your replies with it but people trust you more so they follow and engage.\n2. Pick a mission: Pick some cool mission (like i picked growing [my app](https://brandled.app/) from 0→$1k mrr)> this will create a good storyline for your content and will make people remember you\n3. Optimize your profile: Add a good headshot, good banner (not like linkedin), bio that shows your mission and progress and a pinned tweet that showcases what you're building\n\n• **Replies Strategy:** Initially your posts won't work so you need to be a reply guy in order to grow. Here's how to be one:\n\nWhat you need to do is pick 40-50 creators in your niche (<5000 followers) and add them to a list on X itself and regularly engage with their posts, not \"Good Post\" and \"best of luck\" replies but replies that adds some value, they should be either funny, controversial or value adding.\n\n• **Content Strategy:** If you have a small account, then pick a big X community like you can pick buildinpublic if you're in SaaS and just post in that instead of posting to everyone. You should be posting 3-5 times per day.\n\n• **Writing Good Posts:** Here's the checklist you should follow for writing good posts:  \n\\- Show your FACE 🚨  \n\\- Never text-only posts (image + video 📸)  \n\\- Post between 9am - 5pm EST -  \n\\- Write short sentences (no long paragraphs!)\n\n• **REPLY to everyone who engages with your posts.**\n\n• **How to get users:** Document your journey of building your product, showcase its features in a cool way, that's how you'll be getting the inbound. Pro tip: warm DM the people who regularly engage with your posts and invite them to try out your product.\n\n**What Don't Work:**  \n\\> Posting one-liners and \"let's connect\" tweets, yes they can get you followers but they won't engage with your future posts which will make your account die as X algo first push your posts to the followers and then to rest of the people\n\n\\> Cold DMS; Don't ever try it.\n\nOne more pro tip: When a tweet used to get some traction, I used add a reply with link of [my product](https://brandled.app/), this way I was able to turn that traffic into visitors.\n\nThere you have it, nothing fancy, nothing controversial. This strategy got me 50k+ impressions in my first month.\n\nI’d love to hear if you’ve tried something similar or if you have other tips for X.",

Just launched [NewCV.ai](http://NewCV.ai) on Product Hunt today. 🤞🏼\n\n  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/newcv-ai](https://www.producthunt.com/products/newcv-ai)\n\n  \nIt’s an AI tool that turns any job link into a tailored, ATS-ready CV + cover letter.\n\n\n\nWould genuinely appreciate any feedback from this community — especially around positioning or clarity.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions here too. 🥹\n\n",

I myself rarely visit the site to see what's in the top 5/10, and even then I often see the same \"TODO\" application remade with AI.\nMost of the products at the top of the list are not even worth your attention or time. Once, out of curiosity, I looked at more products, about 100 of them, and most of them are either clones that are the same but think they are different, or AI slop made over the weekend and released on Product Hunt to make a quick buck.\nIf you want users, you definitely won't get them on ProductHunt.\n\nBesides, anyone who sees ads on ProductHunt can see them, but I don't even see the promoted ones, and it's very clear.",

It's been super helpful for building those decision-making muscles before an actual interview. The AI feedback is pretty insightful too, it's helped me spot some blind spots I didn't even know I had.

Literally chatting. You can log expenses naturally as you spend, or dump everything later in the day. It organizes them into categories with budgets, and then you can ask real questions — like where you’re paying more for the same items, how prices changed over time, or which categories spike on weekends.\n\nNo apps. No spreadsheets. No signup.  \nJust ask Costman about your money and get clarity when you need it.\n\nIf you want to support, you can do it here: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/costman/launches](https://www.producthunt.com/products/costman/launches)",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been active on Product Hunt for the last 179 days straight. Not just scrolling, but following launches daily, analyzing rankings, talking with founders, and helping on launches.\n\nOver time, I started noticing patterns, clear similarities between successful launches: some launches clearly perform better than others: based on timing, category, competition, and other signals. It made me realize that Product Hunt launches are driven far more by data than intuition.\n\nThat’s what led me to build PHSimulator: [https://www.producthunt.com/products/producthunt-simulator-2?launch=producthunt-simulator-2](https://www.producthunt.com/products/producthunt-simulator-2?launch=producthunt-simulator-2)\n\nIt’s a platform that let you simulate you ProductHunt Launch, meant to help founders launch on ProductHunt, predict their ranking, understand their launch context, optimize it to improve their chances of reaching the top5.\n\nLooking for honest feedback. Planning to launch very soon on ProductHunt 🙏\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1r170en)",

Lock the aspect ratios you need behind $12/month paywalls\n4. Upload your videos to their servers (privacy concern)\n\nSo I built FreeCropper. However the result was not that good - I’m seeing single visitors per day basically no backlinks, and almost no returning users.\n\nI’ve tried targeting “free video cropper” SEO, keeping the UX extremely simple, and leaning hard into the free + privacy angle.\n\nIf you were in my position, what should you do? would you double down, monetize, or walk away?",

The unfortunate thing about today’s audience is they want things that are super specific and walk them through the process.
