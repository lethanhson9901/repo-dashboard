The default media engine is DirectShow which supports more advanced options such as frame interpolation, higher quality scalers, proper HDR support, etc.\n\nSome of the premium features include a much more modern and highly customizable user interface, a media library, browsing content and streaming from PLEX, Emby, Jellyfin media servers. TV/VOD streaming with EPG support (from a provider of your choice). Dual UI modes (Windowed and Home Theater) and much much more.\n\nOh... and me, a responsive developer who listens to what people wants and tries to act upon it (within what my resources as an Indie dev. allow).",

Just me, the code, and a belief that if the product is genuinely good, it can speak for itself.\n\nA few things I think helped this launch:\n\n  \n🎯**Extreme clarity in the tagline**\n\nI cut all the buzzwords. “Tab-to-complete everywhere” is it. If someone can’t understand what a product does in a couple seconds, they’re gone. Clarity beats cleverness every time.\n\n🙂 **Putting a face to it**\n\nSo many AI tools feel anonymous. I wanted the opposite. I showed my face in the demo and thumbnail because I want people to know there’s a real person behind this, and that I stand behind what I’m building.\n\n✨ **Treating design as trust**\n\nPeople decide fast. I spent a lot of time on the gallery images because screenshots are the first signal of quality. If it looks thoughtful and polished, people assume the product is too.\n\n\n\nI’ll be around in the comments, so happy to answer anything or hear what resonated.\n\n— Jared",

I'm the founder of Lection, a Chrome extension that allows you to build scrapers for any site just by chatting!\n\nYou install the extension, go to a page, and enter the data you'd like. After the AI analyzes the page, you have a script you can run infinite times to give you the data! You can even then take that data and host it to run it at regular intervals and use it as a webhook or with automation software. If you want to test it out with a free trial of the higher tiers, DM me and let me know how you'd want to use it!\n\nI'm around and would love to answer any questions on the development experience and the kinds of things AI might be capable of in webscraping. The project is still in its early stages, so I'd love feedback, feature ideas, or critiques! Check us out here: https://www.lection.app/ or on the chrome webstore.",

The goal is to make voice notes actually useful instead of turning into audio files you never revisit.\n\n**What Echo does:**\n\n* Records voice notes, meetings, or quick ideas\n* Automatically turns audio into text\n* Creates short summaries from long recordings\n* Lets you ask questions about past notes\n* Keeps everything searchable and organized\n\nWe built this because typing during meetings or when ideas hit feels slow and distracting. Voice is faster, but raw recordings are messy. Echo tries to close that gap by making voice structured and easy to work with.\n\nIf this sounds interesting, we are live on Product Hunt today and would really appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or criticism:  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/echo-35?launch=echo-fd149df1-a337-4f81-9665-8ff9e426ac4f](https://www.producthunt.com/products/echo-35?launch=echo-fd149df1-a337-4f81-9665-8ff9e426ac4f)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the product, the build process, or why we chose to focus on voice notes in the first place.",

I was confused as hell about who to trust.\n\nDuring a rough phase, I started asking ChatGPT about my birth chart. It was surprisingly accurate and consistent. That's when I thought—what if I could build a personal AI astrologer that actually sits in your phone 24/7?\n\nSo I built **OrbitPro**.\n\nPitched this idea 1.5 years ago. Nobody believed it could work. But I had this gut feeling this could be something real.\n\n**What we built:**\n\n* Available in 6 global languages\n* Orbit can TALK in 70+ international languages\n* Orbit TALKS and CHATS based on your natal chart\n* We trained a whole engine specifically for this\n* **Powered by Google**\n\n**Here's what I want you to do:**\n\n1. Generate your report on OrbitPro\n2. Ask the same questions to ChatGPT, Gemini, or any other LLM\n3. Compare the accuracy\n\nI hope we won't disappoint you. Try talking to Orbit. Try chatting with Orbit. I'm sure you won't regret it.\n\n**Going live:** 30 hours (January 1, 2026)  \n**BETA :** [**https://global-mvp-1-8.vercel.app/**](https://global-mvp-1-8.vercel.app/)\n\n**LIVE :** [orbitpro.ai](http://orbitpro.ai/)  \n**Code for Reddit fam:** **HEYORBIT** \\- gets you 80% off ($2/month)  \n**Valid:** First 1,000 users, 1 month only\n\n\n\n**Follow the journey:** [https://www.instagram.com/orbitpro.ai/](https://www.instagram.com/orbitpro.ai/)\n\n on Instagram\n\n\n\nDrop your honest feedback. That's all I ask.\n\nIf you vibe with it, share with **#HeyOrbit**\n\n**Credits:** Massive thanks to Google and all the tech influencers who believed in this vision and helped me build OrbitPro.\n\n* theorbitguy (Founder)\n\nLet's see where this goes. 🚀",

The results have been pretty mixed. Sometimes I get a few hundred upvotes, sometimes just a handful.\n\nWhat I consistently notice after a launch is that my Linkedin gets flooded with connection requests from people offering to \"guarantee\" hundreds of upvotes for my next ProductHunt launch, which is basically selling bot or vote farm services. That alone already make me question how much signal there really is in upvotes.\n\nMore importantly, even on launches that did relatively well in terms of upvotes, I don't see many real users coming from ProductHunt. Traffic spikes briefly, but conversions are usually minimal.\n\nSo I'm wondering has ProductHunt actually been a meaningful user acquisition channel for founders.",

Try adding a quick goal setup per session to make wins tangible, that can boost focus and retention, and run small community challenges for accountability to make sessions feel less lonely. I built SignalScouter, a founder led Reddit outreach service that can find posts where users seek solutions and reply founder style to cut through doom scrolling, it got 89 signups and 10k+ views in days, would love feedback or to connect if you try it, good luck with Focus Cab",

With Hard Mode (Screen Time API), the block is system-wide. So, if a user tries to doom-scroll, they literally can't open the app without killing their session and losing their progress. That friction is usually enough to break the loop. I like the idea of 'session goals' and 'community challenges'—definitely something I'm looking into for the roadmap.

Parents today are paying for apps ($), courses ($$) and sleep consultants ( $$$)  aimed to help their child sleep better, but few options offer on-demand personalized guidance and emotional support, as well as simple tools to complete sleep training.  \n\n### Proof it's real\n\n- **TikTok #sleeptraining** (78k posts) - Top posts are about tips for sleep training, getting over the shame sleep training and vlogs showing “realistic” sleepless nights.\n- **Google Trends**: \"sleep training help\" spikes between 4:30am-5:30am EST consistently.\n- **Reddit r/sleeptrain** (152k members) - Recent posts include users finding significant value in using ChatGPT for emotional support and hyper-personalized recommendations.\n\n### Who's doing it\n\n**Primary user**: First-time mothers, ages 28-38, middle to upper-middle class, college-educated, back at work or returning soon. High anxiety about \"doing it right,\" exhausted from sleep deprivation, feeling isolated during overnight hours. \n\n### Market landscape\n\n**Macro trends:**\n\n- Delayed parenthood = older, higher-income first-time parents with more disposable income\n- Erosion of extended family support (grandparents living farther away)\n- Increasing parental anxiety and information overload creating paralysis\n\n**Existing competitors:**\n\n- Sleep trainer- Ferber method ($2.99) - provides timers and tracking tools specifically for sleep training,  but guidance is  unpersonalized.\n- Subscription based apps like Huckleberry and Napper, which aren’t specifically for sleep training, but aimed to help improve a baby’s sleep through predictions,  and extensive logging and tracking of daytime sleep & feeds , which often in turn can create more anxiety.\n- Huckleberry Plus ($14.99)  offers  24/7 guidance with a expert-vetted AI chat, but users report paying for Plus mainly to get personalized sleep recommendations suggesting their version of an AI chat is not adding any clear value for subscribers.\n- *Taking Cara Babies* (2.8M followers)($179 courses): Pre-recorded content, must pay an extra $75 for  40min of real-time support. \n- *Local sleep consultants* ($300-$800): Cost prohibitive for most parents.\n\n**Gap in market**:Parents want sleep training guidance, tools, and emotional support *in the moment* without the overhead of daily tracking or the cost of a personal consultant.",

I spent weeks just getting basic playback to work smoothly across devices.\n\nUser testing with parents is... unique. Unlike testing with other adults, you're essentially testing with someone while they're managing chaos most of the times. Got real feedback like \"this is great but can you make it work while my toddler is screaming?\"\n\nThe AI integration learning curve was steep. Turns out getting consistent, quality output that actually sounds good took way more engineering and fine-tuning than expected.\n\nMobile-first isn't just nice-to-have - it's essential. Parents are on their phones constantly. \n\nThe biggest breakthrough: Realizing that the technical solution was only 30% of the problem. Understanding the actual user context (distracted kids, multitasking chaos) changed everything about how I designed the experience.\n\nIs there anyone here developing a product that solves a parental issue or a product for kid’s entertainment? would love to hear your experiences\n\n  \n",
