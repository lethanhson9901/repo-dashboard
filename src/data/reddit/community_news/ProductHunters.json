      "text": "Look, I know this isn't some $50k MRR flex... but hear me out.\n\nI see you grinding at 2 AM, convincing yourself that \"one more feature\" will finally get you customers. It won't.\n\nI wasted 6 months building shit nobody asked for before I realized something - as a solo founder stuck at $0, your problem isn't your product. It's everything else. Here's exactly what changed:\n\n**1. I Stopped \"Building\" and Started Talking**\n\nBig mistake: I spent 5 months coding in isolation thinking \"build it and they will come.\"\n\nThey didn't come.\n\nThen I forced myself to do something uncomfortable - I started cold messaging 50 people on LinkedIn every single day. Not copy-paste spam. Actually personalized messages to people who engage with top posts in my niche.\n\nResponse rate: 15-20%.\n\nThese people told me what they actually wanted. \n\nYour obsession with coding is just avoiding rejection.\n\n**2. Fuck Your Feature List**\n\nThis one hurt but... I deleted 7 features I spent weeks building.\n\nTurned out 3% of users ever clicked on them.\n\nStripped everything down to ONE thing: AI content that sounds like you, not ChatGPT.\n\nMade that 10x better instead of adding more mediocre features.\n\nYour feature bloat is killing you. Pick one thing and make it unfairly good.\n\n**3. The Pricing Move That Felt Insane**\n\nStarted at $19/month to \"compete\" with bigger tools at $39.\n\nConversion rate: 6%.\n\nThen I did something that felt stupid - raised it to $29/month.\n\nConversions went UP to 11%.\n\nPlus the customers who complained about the $10 difference:  \n  \nThey were going to be nightmare support tickets anyway.\n\nStop racing to the bottom.   \n  \nYour low price isn't helping you.\n\n**4. Reddit Became My Unfair Advantage**\n\nWhile everyone's trying to hack the algorithm on X, I did the most unsexy thing possible...\n\nWrote ONE valuable post per day on Reddit.   \n  \nNo promo links in the post. (Just let people ask)\n\nOne post drove 50+ qualified visitors. That's more than weeks of \"viral\" tweets with 50k impressions ever did.\n\nNow I repurpose that one post across 5-10 relevant subreddits.\n\nCost: $0. Time: 60 minutes per day.\n\n**5. SEO But Make It Actually Smart**\n\nEveryone told me: \"Write about LinkedIn growth tips!\"\n\nCool, I'd be competing with HubSpot, Neil Patel, and every marketing blog with DA 80+.\n\nI'd never rank.\n\nSo I went bottom-of-funnel instead:\n\n* \"Brandled vs \\[competitor\\]\" comparison pages\n* \"Best \\[competitor\\] alternatives\"\n* \"\\[competitor\\] review\"\n\nThese get 50-200 searches per month. But everyone searching is ready to buy.\n\nAnd I can actually rank for them.\n\nOne comparison page drives more revenue than 10 \"tips and tricks\" articles ever did.\n\n**6. I Stopped Pretending to Be a Big Company**\n\n**The Solo Founder's Actual Edge**\n\nYou can't outspend funded competitors. You can't out-hire them. You can't out-build them.\n\nBut you can out-care them.\n\nEvery customer gets a personal response from me. Every feature request gets a Loom video (even if it's a \"no\"). Every cancelled user gets a real email asking what I could've done better.\n\nBig companies can't do this. Their support team doesn't even know their founder.\n\nYou ARE the founder. That's your moat.\n\n**Why I Almost Quit (And Why You Shouldn't)**\n\nMonth 3: $0. Thought about quitting. Month 4: $0. Definitely thought about quitting. Month 5: $0. Wrote my \"I'm shutting down\" post. Month 6: Changed everything. Hit $126 in 4 days.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you: most founders quit right before things work.\n\nNot because their idea was bad. Because they ran out of patience.\n\nThe difference between $0 and $126 isn't talent. It's just refusing to quit when everything feels pointless.\n\n**The Truth About \"Making It\"**\n\nI'm not at $20k MRR. I'm not at $10k. I'm at $126.\n\nBut you know what? I went from \"this will never work\" to \"holy shit, people are actually paying me.\"\n\nThat mental shift is worth more than the money.\n\nBecause now I know the model works. Now it's just about repetition.\n\nKeep doing outreach. Keep writing content. Keep talking to users. Keep shipping.\n\n$126 becomes $500. $500 becomes $2k. $2k becomes $10k.\n\nBut only if you don't quit at $0.\n\nLook, I'm not some guru. I'm just a solo founder who wasted 6 months doing everything wrong.\n\nBut if you're stuck at $0 like I was, maybe my mistakes can save you some time.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share more details.\n\n(And yeah, the tool is Brandled - helps founders grow on LinkedIn & X without sounding like ChatGPT. But more importantly: just keep building. Most people quit right before it works.)",

The idea is simple: recognition is easier than recall. You don’t memorize strings, you recognize something personal.\n\nThe second controversial part: passwords are never stored.\nNot encrypted. Not hashed. Not in a vault.\n\nPasswords are regenerated on demand using cryptographic primitives, on-device checks and end-to-end encryption. If there’s a breach, there’s literally no password database to dump.\n\nThis raises a real question: If you were designing password security from scratch today, would you still use a master password at all?\n\nLooking forward to hearing honest takes… supportive or critical. 🙏🏻 \n",

          "text": "Cryptography and Security in Computing are quite complex sciences. Be careful of not making security claims if you cannot prove them. You don't want to be sued for false advertising in the event of a breach.\n\nFor instance, if you don't store passwords but store a way to re-generate them (a seed, an image, anything that allows you to to recognize the user and restore their passwords), you are indeed storing the passwords. Not in a plain-text or encrypted way, but in a \"function, argument\" pair. The function is how you generate the passwords (your algorithm), and the arguments are the URLs, images, user choices, etc.\n\nThe only way to not store passwords is to not store them. In which case, the user has to provide them, and hence your password manager has no functionality. It seems mathematically impossible for a password manager to not store the passwords.\n\nThen for the images: be careful of brute-force attacks. If you show 3 images to the user and they have to recognize which one is theirs, any attacker has a 1/3 probability of guessing right. Same, if the user has to take a photo of something personal, any attacker who guesses what that object is, or gets their hands on one of the past photos, will gain access to all the passwords. If you store the photos in an aim to implement \"you cannot use the same photo twice\", then any attacker stealing your photos gets access to the passwords of every user.\n\n**Complex stuff. I would recommend you don't do this.** Current password managers and 2FA tech comes out of government agencies, universities and big-budget companies (Microsoft, Google). There is a reason: you need a few post-doc level cryptographers working for several months or years to produce a password manager that does its job: don't lose the passwords, don't reveal them to anyone else but the user.",

      "text": "i'm the founder of brandled (helps founders grow on X & LinkedIn),\n\nPretty competitive space,\n\nI entered with $0 and 0 followers.\n\ni spent 6 months at $0 and was about to quit.\n\nBut then I changed my approach and suddenly I hit $126 mrr within 4 days and linearly growing since than.\n\n# The real reason you're stuck at $0\n\nyou're not stuck because your product sucks or the market is saturated.\n\nyou're stuck because you're solving the wrong problem.\n\nthat problem isn't your product. it's your approach to getting the first dollar.\n\n# The psychology of $0 (and why it destroys you)\n\nwhen you're at $0, you have zero momentum.\n\nevery action feels pointless. your brain is literally wired to quit because it sees no evidence that effort leads to reward.\n\ni'd code for 12 hours thinking \"once this feature is done, product will be better than competitors and users will naturally come and pay.\" they didn't. so i'd add another feature and tried to perfect my tool. still $0.\n\nthe problem was i was trying to build momentum through building, when **building doesn't create momentum at $0.**\n\n**what actually creates momentum:**\n\n* talking to customers\n* making sales\n* getting rejected 50 times and learning from it\n\n# Why most founders fail\n\n97% of solo founders never break $10k mrr. not because they don't work hard. because they build their go-to-market strategy around their product instead of their customer's buying journey.\n\n**you think:** \"my tool saves 10 hours per week, so people will obviously pay $29/month.\"\n\n**reality:** people buy when they're actively looking for a solution right now.\n\ni wasted months writing \"how to grow on linkedin\" blog posts trying to rank for high traffic keywords.\n\nrevenue driven: zero.\n\nthen i wrote comparison pages. \"brandled vs taplio.\" \"best hypefury alternatives.\"\n\nthese get 50-200 searches per month. but everyone searching is literally in buying mode right now.\n\n# The $0 to $1 playbook\n\nforget \"building an audience\" for now. at $0, you need proof that someone will pay you.\n\n**Step 1: find where your customers are making buying decisions**\n\nnot where they hang out. where they're actively solving the problem you solve.\n\n**for me:** linkedin and x posts where top creators share content tips. commenters are my exact customers.\n\nspend 2 hours finding 5-10 of these places. that's your entire market for the next month.\n\n**Step 2: have 50 real conversations (not pitches)**\n\ni sent 50 personalized messages per day.\n\nresponse rate: 15-20%. half led nowhere. the other half told me exactly what people would pay for.\n\nhere's the key: you're not selling. you're validating. ask things like:\n\n\"what's the most annoying part of \\[their problem\\]?\"\n\n\"how are you solving this now?\"\n\n\"if you could wave a magic wand, what would the perfect solution look like?\"\n\nthese conversations tell you what to build and who will actually pay.\n\n**Step 3: build based on feedback (not competition)**\n\nnow that you've validated the idea, it's time to build.\n\nbut you don't have to build a better product than your competitors.\n\n**you just have to build one core feature that's 10x better.**\n\nthat's it.\n\nmax time you should spend here: one week.\n\nresist the urge to add \"just one more feature.\" ship it.\n\n**Step 4: build a system that compounds daily**\n\nnow you need to systematize how you got those customers so you can repeat it every single day.\n\n**my daily system:**\n\n**distribution:**\n\n* document my journey on x and linkedin (i use brandled, but you can do it manually)\n* outreach to warm leads (people who reply to tweets or engage with you, message them like a friend and offer a trial)\n* write one valuable reddit post (value first, not product first)\n* publish one high-intent blog article (comparison/alternative/review pages)\n\n**product:**\n\n* improve existing features based on user feedback\n* fix bugs and issues users report\n* only build new features if users are desperately asking AND it's a no-brainer\n\n**operations:**\n\n* one-on-one call with every user on day 7 of their trial\n* email everyone who cancels or goes quiet, ask for honest feedback\n* use that feedback to improve onboarding or product\n\nthis isn't glamorous. but it's systematic customer acquisition.\n\n# Why most founders optimize the wrong thing\n\n**the only question that matters at this stage:** \"how do i get someone to pay me this week?\"\n\nat $0, spend **80% of your time on distribution and talking with users** and 20% building what they'll pay for.\n\nnot the other way around.\n\n# What to do tomorrow\n\nif you're at $0 right now:\n\n**day 1:** stop building features. close your code editor.\n\n**day 2-3:** spend 3 hours finding where your customers discuss their problems.\n\n**day 4-7:** send 20-50 personalized messages daily. just conversations, not pitches.\n\nby end of week, you'll have talked to 100 people.\n\n# The hard truth\n\n**your job at $0 isn't to be a developer. your job is to be a salesperson who can code.**\n\nonce you make that mental shift, being stuck at $0 becomes impossible.\n\nI’m not at $10k mrr now. not life changing. but i went from \"this will never work\" to \"holy shit this actually works.\"\n\nnow i know the playbook. talk to customers. build what they'll pay for. repeat.\n\ni'm documenting everything as i build brandled to $10k mrr minimum. not the highlight reel. the real shit.\n\nif you're stuck at $0, i hope this helps. happy to answer questions.\n\n  \n",

One prompt and it:\n\n\t∙\tScrapes businesses from Google Maps\n\n\t∙\tBuilds custom websites\n\n\t∙\tRecords video walkthroughs\n\n\t∙\tSends personalized outreach\n\nYou just wait for replies.\n\nLaunching a product is always a learning experience, so I’d appreciate any honest feedback, thoughts, or lessons learned from fellow makers who’ve launched before.\n\nIf you’re also building something, feel free to share - always down to check out other projects.\n\nHere’s the Product Hunt page:\n\n👉 https://www.producthunt.com/products/unloopa\n\nThanks for taking a look 🙏",

We launched on Product Hunt as a small team (3 people) and ended up Top-2 of the Month in December btw ✌🏼\n\n**What was the most confusing or stressful decision before launch?**  \nHonestly — none. We started preparing 2–3 weeks before with a PH consultant who helped us stay on track. We followed a clear plan:\n\n* prepared all launch materials\n* warmed up our PH accounts (commenting, voting, posting) so they looked natural and passed verification\n* did everything we could to get featured\n\n**What did you underprepare?**  \nOne stressful thing was totally out of our control — someone tried to launch our product before us. We contacted PH support and they fixed it pretty fast. Tip: check in advance if someone already posted your product without you 🥲 and don’t be afraid to message PH support.\n\n**If I had 7 days to relaunch, what would I do differently?**  \nI’d build a bigger list of people who could support the launch. Every vote really matters — with a bigger support crew we might have taken #1 for the month.\n\n**One small hack:**  \nIn the first 4 hours after launch, comments are just as important as upvotes. Votes aren’t visible at first, but comments are! So even your own team leaving supportive comments helps a lot.\n\nJust make sure your team’s PH profiles are verified in advance. Usually It takes about 2 weeks and you need to be active, but not spammy!",

Was it mostly execution once the plan was set, or were there still moments where you had to pause and decide what really mattered?\n\nAlso, the “bigger support list” takeaway is useful, but it raises a question I keep running into: how much of that list was pre-existing versus intentionally built just for the launch?\n\nTrying to understand what’s genuinely repeatable for a small team without external help, versus what depends on experience and networks.",

I was responsible for all the launch copy, and I spent most of my time figuring out what to highlight — which benefits actually matter, how to tell our story in a way that’s interesting and easy to follow, and how to naturally show that our product fits Product Hunt values without it sounding forced.\n\nEven with a plan, we still thought through different scenarios:  \nwhat if we don’t get featured, what if we’re not in the top 10, what if traction is slower or faster than expected. So it wasn’t just blind execution — we were constantly adjusting based on how things could play out.\n\nAbout the support list — it was a mix. Some people were already in our network, and some we reached out to specifically for the launch. I’d love to know what % of votes came from that list vs organic users, but unfortunately PH doesn’t give you that kind of data.",

      "text": "Hey everyone👋\n\nSuper excited to share that Atoms just went live on Product Hunt. This update might be one of the biggest leaps for AI builders this year.\n\nAtoms is not just another AI coding assistant. Atoms acts like a complete AI software team, with architects, developers, and researchers all working together to take your idea from concept to a fully running product.\n\n* **End-to-end app creation:** You describe what you want, and Atoms breaks it down, plans it, codes it, and ships a running full-stack app.\n* **Multi-agent collaboration:** Different AI agents specialize in research, coding, debugging, or design, and they actually collaborate in real time.\n* **Deep Research:** Before any code is written, Iris does in-depth research, comparing frameworks, APIs, and architectures.\n* **Best of N (Race Mode) :** Atoms runs multiple versions of your task in parallel and picks the best performing one automatically.\n* **Multi-language and mobile optimized:** Sites run fast on mobile and adapt to multiple languages natively.\n* **Reusable backend templates with full backend capabilities:** Atoms now ships backend templates that are production-level, not demos. It's basically giving you a reusable backend foundation you can extend, saving days of setup.\n\nIf you've ever used tools like Lovable, Bolt, or Relevance AI, this feels like the next step, more engineering team and less AI toy. You can literally build an MVP or startup prototype without switching tools halfway.\n\nAtoms is live today on Product Hunt, and I'd love to know what you think of it:\n\n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/atoms-2](https://www.producthunt.com/products/atoms-2)\n\nIf you're into AI agents, multi-agent systems, or the next-gen dev workflow, it's definitely worth checking out.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and feedback. I'm curious if others are seeing the same AI team feel I did!\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qbpdqf/video/4buukz5lt3dg1/player\n\n",

We're planning several Product Hunt launches throughout 2026 and I'm doing research on what actually resonates with the PH community these days.\n\nI've noticed the platform has evolved quite a bit—what used to work (another productivity tool, Chrome extension) feels saturated now. With AI being slapped on everything and spatial computing starting to gain traction, I'm curious:\n\n**What types of products are you seeing crush it on Product Hunt lately?**\n\nSpecifically interested in:\n\n* Categories that consistently hit top 5\n* What makes a product \"Product Hunt worthy\" vs just another launch\n* Are developer tools still dominating, or has the meta shifted?\n* Do niche, focused tools outperform broad platforms now?\n\n**Why I'm asking:** As a builder, I'm not married to any one idea—I want to create products people actually need and use. With multiple launches planned throughout the year, I want to understand where the real opportunity is and what the community actually gets excited about in 2026.\n\nWould love to hear from fellow founders who've launched recently or anyone who actively hunts products daily.",

If you compare other tools like docusign it costs you $40 or 60 per month very costly. And you don't even use the whole thing for what you are paying. This is what we are providing cost-effective tool. When you think of integrating, just let me know. I am just away a message :)",
