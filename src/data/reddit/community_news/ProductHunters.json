The default media engine is DirectShow which supports more advanced options such as frame interpolation, higher quality scalers, proper HDR support, etc.\n\nSome of the premium features include a much more modern and highly customizable user interface, a media library, browsing content and streaming from PLEX, Emby, Jellyfin media servers. TV/VOD streaming with EPG support (from a provider of your choice). Dual UI modes (Windowed and Home Theater) and much much more.\n\nOh... and me, a responsive developer who listens to what people wants and tries to act upon it (within what my resources as an Indie dev. allow).",

      "text": "Hey, I went into SaaS last year with my tool Brandled (helps founders grow on X & LinkedIn) in a pretty competitive space with $0 and 0 audience and ended up wasting six months straight on the wrong things.\n\nSpent half a year stuck at $0 MRR before I figured out what actually matters.\n\nHere's everything I learned the hard way. Wish someone had told me this on day one.\n\n**1. Offer Google/social login. Seriously.**\n\nI started with the magic link only. (cause i adopted ship fast mentality on the wrong things)\n\nMy signup completion rate was 45%.\n\nAdded Google OAuth. It jumped to 78% overnight.\n\nFriction at signup is invisible revenue loss. Every extra step costs you 20-30% of potential users.\n\nTakes like 1 hour to implement. \n\n**2. Post-launch is 80% marketing, 20% product. Maybe even 90/10.**\n\nI spent 3 months building features.\n\nThen I \"launched.\"\n\nGot 12 signups. 0 paying customer.\n\nI thought: \"The product isn't good enough yet. Let me add more features.\"\n\nSpent another week building.\n\nBut still got no results.\n\nThe problem wasn't my product. The problem was nobody knew it existed.\n\nHere's the truth: your product only needs to solve ONE problem well. That's it. Everything else is marketing.\n\nI know founders with worse products than mine making $50k MRR because they're good at marketing.\n\nI know founders with better products than mine making $0 because they suck at marketing.\n\nPost-launch, you should spend 80% of your time getting eyeballs on your product and 20% improving it based on paying customer feedback.\n\nNot the other way around.\n\n**3. Market shamelessly. Talk about your product everywhere.**\n\nI was terrified of being \"salesy.\"\n\nSo I'd post about \"building in public\" but never actually mention my product.\n\nI'd write valuable content on Reddit but never link to my tool.\n\nSo I was staring $0 MRR every day.\n\nThen I started being shameless and mentioning my product everywhere.\n\nNobody will discover your product by accident. You have to put it in their face. Repeatedly.\n\nThe people who get offended by promotion weren't going to buy anyway.\n\n**4. Respect the ones who churn. They're giving you honest feedback.**\n\nWhen users churn, I used to feel rejected.\n\nNow I have an automated email that asks: \"What made you unsubscribe?\"\n\nThe responses are gold.  \n  \nA lot of times, I was able to get them back by just guiding them or fixing some minor issue in the tool.\n\n**5. Use your own product every single day. Not once a week. Every. Day.**\n\nI built Brandled but wasn't using it consistently for my own content.\n\nOne day I forced myself to use it like a real user would.\n\nFound 7 bugs in 30 minutes. Things I never noticed in testing.\n\nMy users were experiencing all of this and not telling me. They were just leaving.\n\nNow I use Brandled for everything.\n\nI catch problems before my users do. And I understand their workflow because I live it.\n\nIf you're not using your own product daily, you're building blind.\n\n**6. Retention > acquisition.**\n\nI was obsessed with getting new signups.\n\nRan ads. Did outreach. Posted everywhere.\n\nMeanwhile, my churn rate was 40% per month.\n\nI'd get 10 new customers and lose 4 old ones.\n\nNet growth: 6.\n\nI was filling a leaky bucket.\n\nThen I focused on retention:\n\n* Fixed onboarding\n* Added email sequences to keep users engaged\n* Built features existing customers actually asked for\n* Checked in with users who went quiet\n\nChurn dropped to 15%.\n\nNow when I get 10 new customers, I only lose 2-3.\n\nNet growth: 7-8.\n\nSame marketing effort, but better results.\n\n\n\n**7. Your MVP should only have the must-haves. Actually stick to MoSCoW.**\n\nI know everyone says this. But I didn't listen.\n\nMy \"MVP\" had:\n\n* Content generation\n* Analytics dashboard\n* Post scheduling\n* Competitor tracking\n* SWOT analysis\n* Comment assistant\n* Hashtag research\n\nThat's not an MVP.\n\nI should've launched with ONE feature: AI content generation that sounds like you.\n\nThat's it.\n\nEverything else should've come after people paid for that one thing.\n\nHere's how MoSCoW actually works:\n\n* **Must have:** The ONE thing that solves the core problem\n* **Should have:** Stuff you add after the first 10 paying customers ask for it\n* **Could have:** Nice-to-haves that you build if you have extra time (you won't)\n* **Won't have:** Everything else (most of your ideas belong here)\n\nYour MVP should make people go \"holy shit, this solves my problem\" even if it's ugly and missing features.\n\nNot \"wow, this has so many features\" while not solving anything particularly well.\n\n**8. Price based on value, not competition.**\n\nI looked at my competitors:\n\n* Taplio: $39/month\n* SuperX: $29/month\n* Hypefury: $29/month\n\nI priced Brandled at $19/month to \"undercut the market.\"\n\nBig mistake.\n\nLow price signals low value. People assumed I was inferior.\n\nPlus, at $19/month, I needed 263 customers to hit $5k MRR.\n\nAt $39/month, I need 128.\n\nHalf the customers for the same revenue.\n\nThen I realized: my tool saves people 10+ hours per week. That's worth $500-$700/month atleast for most founders.\n\nI wasn't competing on price. I was competing on value.\n\nRaised my price to $29/month - $39/month. Conversions actually IMPROVED.\n\nBecause the people who care about $10 differences aren't your best customers anyway.\n\nYour best customers care about results, not price.\n\nPrice for the value you deliver, not for what your competitors charge.\n\n**The Truth Most SaaS Founders Don't Want to Hear:**\n\nMost SaaS founders don't fail because of bad ideas.\n\nThey fail because they give up too early.\n\n90% of SaaS products are gone within 2 years.\n\nNot because they couldn't work.\n\nBecause the founder quit before they figured out what works.\n\nI almost quit at month 5. I was depressed. Burnt out. Convinced I was wasting my time.\n\nThen I changed my approach and hit $126 MRR in 4 days.\n\nStill small. But it's proof the model works.\n\nNow it's just about staying consistent and not quitting when shit gets hard (which it will).\n\n**Here's my commitment:**\n\nI'm building this to $10k MRR minimum. No matter how long it takes.\n\nI'm documenting everything on X and LinkedIn.\n\nNot the highlight reel. The real shit. The mistakes. The failures. The small wins.\n\nIf you're building something, my advice: stay in the game.\n\nMost people quit right before things start working.\n\nDon't be most people.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share more details on any of this.\n\n",

Once they launch… they kinda disappear.\n\nNot judging, I genuinely get that people are busy, tired, burned out, whatever. But it made me think: if someone showed up for you during your launch, isn’t it just good karma to show up for others too?\n\nIt takes like 30–60 seconds to throw an upvote or a quick comment.\n\nWhy do you think this happens? Post-launch burnout? People only show up when they need something? Too many asks?",

That’s why I created SafeAfter, a way to keep passwords private today, while making sure trusted people can access them when it’s truly needed.\n\nSecurity was a top priority from day one. SafeAfter doesn’t connect to the internet at all. There’s no cloud, no servers, no accounts. Everything is stored locally on the device and encrypted using system-level security. Even the app itself can’t “see” your data unless access conditions are met.\n\nTo make setup easy, you can also import passwords from popular browsers and password managers, so you don’t have to start from scratch!\n\nI’m really curious what you think! Feedback, questions, concerns, or ideas are more than welcome. I’ll be here answering comments and I genuinely hope SafeAfter can help you plan for situations we rarely want to think about, but probably should.",

The passwords are not plain text, they're in a password protected 7 zip file, the password to that is in a readme and involves references that only my relatives would know - noone with access to dglegacy (hackers, employees, etc.) can access the 7 zip file. The crypto is protected with a physical key that my parents and partner are in possession of (but they still need the password from dglegacy).\n\nOP not to put shade on your idea, it's a valid problem with not many good solutions.

Most users won't go through the hassle of creating an encrypted 7zip archive. They expect to type secrets into a ui, but they (rightfully) refuse to trust a non famous saas with that input. Unless the platform uses verifiable client side zero knowledge encryption (where the server literally never sees the key), the \"unknown app\" factor is a dealbreaker for anyone with significant assets.\n\nDo you think a non technical relative would actually be able to open or decrypt that 7zip file without your help?",

No servers, nothing - user data stays only on their device and nowhere else.\n\nAs for pricing, up to 5 passwords is free, which covers the most important ones. If someone wants to add more, there’s a one-time payment of $9.99 (or the local equivalent). And if someone truly falls in love with the app, there’s also a \"Donate\" button that just opens an email to me.

The barrier to entry for a \"trust-based\" app is massive; knowing users can test the waters without pulling out a credit card significantly lowers that friction.\n\nI respect the commitment to stripping out RevenueCat and Analytics. Verifying \"No Internet Access\" in the OS permissions is indeed the gold standard for privacy, and that definitely solves the \"Data Exfiltration\" fear.\n\nBut this brings me back to the architecture question: **If the app has no internet access, how does the \"Switch\" actually work?** A Dead Man's Switch usually implies an automated trigger (email/SMS) sent *externally* when I stop checking in. If the data lives 100% locally on the device, does this mean the beneficiary needs **physical access** to this specific phone (and its passcode) to retrieve the legacy info?",

A friend of mine was struggling to motivate their 3-year-old to do basic things like brushing teeth, cleaning up toys, etc. The songs and content out there were either too generic or got repetitive really fast.\n\nHere's what caught me off guard during development:\n\nAudio processing is WAY harder than I thought. I spent weeks just getting basic playback to work smoothly across devices.\n\nUser testing with parents is... unique. Unlike testing with other adults, you're essentially testing with someone while they're managing chaos most of the times. Got real feedback like \"this is great but can you make it work while my toddler is screaming?\"\n\nThe AI integration learning curve was steep. Turns out getting consistent, quality output that actually sounds good took way more engineering and fine-tuning than expected.\n\nMobile-first isn't just nice-to-have - it's essential. Parents are on their phones constantly. \n\nThe biggest breakthrough: Realizing that the technical solution was only 30% of the problem. Understanding the actual user context (distracted kids, multitasking chaos) changed everything about how I designed the experience.\n\nIs there anyone here developing a product that solves a parental issue or a product for kid’s entertainment? would love to hear your experiences\n\n  \n",

Just me, the code, and a belief that if the product is genuinely good, it can speak for itself.\n\nA few things I think helped this launch:\n\n  \n🎯**Extreme clarity in the tagline**\n\nI cut all the buzzwords. “Tab-to-complete everywhere” is it. If someone can’t understand what a product does in a couple seconds, they’re gone. Clarity beats cleverness every time.\n\n🙂 **Putting a face to it**\n\nSo many AI tools feel anonymous. I wanted the opposite. I showed my face in the demo and thumbnail because I want people to know there’s a real person behind this, and that I stand behind what I’m building.\n\n✨ **Treating design as trust**\n\nPeople decide fast. I spent a lot of time on the gallery images because screenshots are the first signal of quality. If it looks thoughtful and polished, people assume the product is too.\n\n\n\nI’ll be around in the comments, so happy to answer anything or hear what resonated.\n\n— Jared",

The goal is to make voice notes actually useful instead of turning into audio files you never revisit.\n\n**What Echo does:**\n\n* Records voice notes, meetings, or quick ideas\n* Automatically turns audio into text\n* Creates short summaries from long recordings\n* Lets you ask questions about past notes\n* Keeps everything searchable and organized\n\nWe built this because typing during meetings or when ideas hit feels slow and distracting. Voice is faster, but raw recordings are messy. Echo tries to close that gap by making voice structured and easy to work with.\n\nIf this sounds interesting, we are live on Product Hunt today and would really appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or criticism:  \n[https://www.producthunt.com/products/echo-35?launch=echo-fd149df1-a337-4f81-9665-8ff9e426ac4f](https://www.producthunt.com/products/echo-35?launch=echo-fd149df1-a337-4f81-9665-8ff9e426ac4f)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the product, the build process, or why we chose to focus on voice notes in the first place.",

Try focused community outreach where you answer threads with real value to build trust, run short targeted ads toward anxiety/sleep keywords to drive interested users, and collect quick in-app feedback prompts to iterate fast; each moves awareness, converts curious folks, and sharpens messaging. If scaling outreach becomes a headache you could try a service that finds Reddit posts asking for solutions and drafts founder style replies for your OK, would love feedback or to connect if you try it, and good luck with Plesso launch!",

I was confused as hell about who to trust.\n\nDuring a rough phase, I started asking ChatGPT about my birth chart. It was surprisingly accurate and consistent. That's when I thought—what if I could build a personal AI astrologer that actually sits in your phone 24/7?\n\nSo I built **OrbitPro**.\n\nPitched this idea 1.5 years ago. Nobody believed it could work. But I had this gut feeling this could be something real.\n\n**What we built:**\n\n* Available in 6 global languages\n* Orbit can TALK in 70+ international languages\n* Orbit TALKS and CHATS based on your natal chart\n* We trained a whole engine specifically for this\n* **Powered by Google**\n\n**Here's what I want you to do:**\n\n1. Generate your report on OrbitPro\n2. Ask the same questions to ChatGPT, Gemini, or any other LLM\n3. Compare the accuracy\n\nI hope we won't disappoint you. Try talking to Orbit. Try chatting with Orbit. I'm sure you won't regret it.\n\n**Going live:** 30 hours (January 1, 2026)  \n**BETA :** [**https://global-mvp-1-8.vercel.app/**](https://global-mvp-1-8.vercel.app/)\n\n**LIVE :** [orbitpro.ai](http://orbitpro.ai/)  \n**Code for Reddit fam:** **HEYORBIT** \\- gets you 80% off ($2/month)  \n**Valid:** First 1,000 users, 1 month only\n\n\n\n**Follow the journey:** [https://www.instagram.com/orbitpro.ai/](https://www.instagram.com/orbitpro.ai/)\n\n on Instagram\n\n\n\nDrop your honest feedback. That's all I ask.\n\nIf you vibe with it, share with **#HeyOrbit**\n\n**Credits:** Massive thanks to Google and all the tech influencers who believed in this vision and helped me build OrbitPro.\n\n* theorbitguy (Founder)\n\nLet's see where this goes. 🚀",

My take: This feels \"honest,\" but isn’t it just a recipe for spending 6 months building something nobody wants?\n\nOption B: The \"Sell First\" approach (The Pre-sale/MVP model). You run ads, set up a landing page, or even hop on sales calls for a product that doesn't exist yet. My take: This is \"efficient\" for validation, but honestly, isn't it just selling vaporware? It feels like lying to your customers and burning your reputation before you’ve even started.\n\nI’m torn. One side says, \"Don't waste time building what doesn't sell.\" The other side says, \"If you sell what you haven't built, you're a fraud.\"\n\nFounders of Reddit: Which side are you on?

The results have been pretty mixed. Sometimes I get a few hundred upvotes, sometimes just a handful.\n\nWhat I consistently notice after a launch is that my Linkedin gets flooded with connection requests from people offering to \"guarantee\" hundreds of upvotes for my next ProductHunt launch, which is basically selling bot or vote farm services. That alone already make me question how much signal there really is in upvotes.\n\nMore importantly, even on launches that did relatively well in terms of upvotes, I don't see many real users coming from ProductHunt. Traffic spikes briefly, but conversions are usually minimal.\n\nSo I'm wondering has ProductHunt actually been a meaningful user acquisition channel for founders.",

I'd write a LinkedIn post, realize it was too long, paste it back into Claude to shorten it, then format it... you get the idea.\n\nZunno lets you chain multiple AI prompts together into a single workflow. Set character limits, connect steps, and execute everything with one click.\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Research topic → 2. Write post → 3. Generate hook (all with proper character limits)\n\nWe have a free tier (10 runs/month) to try it out.

I'm a founder too and hated boring timers that felt robotic, so made something to help founders reach folks where they ask for help. Try adding a quick goal setup per session to make wins tangible, that can boost focus and retention, and run small community challenges for accountability to make sessions feel less lonely. I built SignalScouter, a founder led Reddit outreach service that can find posts where users seek solutions and reply founder style to cut through doom scrolling, it got 89 signups and 10k+ views in days, would love feedback or to connect if you try it, good luck with Focus Cab",

              "text": "Great question! Since Focus Cab is a privacy-first app, I don't track what users do outside the app. However, the measure of success is the **'Session Completion Rate'**. With Hard Mode (Screen Time API), the block is system-wide. So, if a user tries to doom-scroll, they literally can't open the app without killing their session and losing their progress. That friction is usually enough to break the loop. I like the idea of 'session goals' and 'community challenges'—definitely something I'm looking into for the roadmap. Congrats on SignalScouter, sounds like a solid tool for finding leads. Thanks for the feedback",

If anyone is interested I can also provide some guidance on how to validate further with real users. \n\n## On-Demand Nighttime Sleep Training Support\n\n### What the behavior is\n\nParents of babies (4-18 months) are desperately seeking non-judgmental real-time , middle of the night, guidance  and support during sleep training. Parents today are paying for apps ($), courses ($$) and sleep consultants ( $$$)  aimed to help their child sleep better, but few options offer on-demand personalized guidance and emotional support, as well as simple tools to complete sleep training.  \n\n### Proof it's real\n\n- **TikTok #sleeptraining** (78k posts) - Top posts are about tips for sleep training, getting over the shame sleep training and vlogs showing “realistic” sleepless nights.\n- **Google Trends**: \"sleep training help\" spikes between 4:30am-5:30am EST consistently.\n- **Reddit r/sleeptrain** (152k members) - Recent posts include users finding significant value in using ChatGPT for emotional support and hyper-personalized recommendations.\n\n### Who's doing it\n\n**Primary user**: First-time mothers, ages 28-38, middle to upper-middle class, college-educated, back at work or returning soon. High anxiety about \"doing it right,\" exhausted from sleep deprivation, feeling isolated during overnight hours. \n\n### Market landscape\n\n**Macro trends:**\n\n- Delayed parenthood = older, higher-income first-time parents with more disposable income\n- Erosion of extended family support (grandparents living farther away)\n- Increasing parental anxiety and information overload creating paralysis\n\n**Existing competitors:**\n\n- Sleep trainer- Ferber method ($2.99) - provides timers and tracking tools specifically for sleep training,  but guidance is  unpersonalized.\n- Subscription based apps like Huckleberry and Napper, which aren’t specifically for sleep training, but aimed to help improve a baby’s sleep through predictions,  and extensive logging and tracking of daytime sleep & feeds , which often in turn can create more anxiety.\n- Huckleberry Plus ($14.99)  offers  24/7 guidance with a expert-vetted AI chat, but users report paying for Plus mainly to get personalized sleep recommendations suggesting their version of an AI chat is not adding any clear value for subscribers.\n- *Taking Cara Babies* (2.8M followers)($179 courses): Pre-recorded content, must pay an extra $75 for  40min of real-time support. \n- *Local sleep consultants* ($300-$800): Cost prohibitive for most parents.\n\n**Gap in market**:Parents want sleep training guidance, tools, and emotional support *in the moment* without the overhead of daily tracking or the cost of a personal consultant.",

Built it because I kept mindlessly opening social media without realizing it.\n\nI've got the product page ready, screenshots finalized after way too many iterations, description written, and some early users ready to support. Launch time is set for 12:01 AM PST.\n\nBut I'm unsure about a few things. Should I be super active in comments or let the product speak? Is there anything I'm probably forgetting that first-time launchers always mess up? What's the best way to engage with the community throughout the day?\n\nWould genuinely appreciate any tips from people who've launched before. What worked for you? What didn't? What do you wish you'd known before your first launch?",

I’ve been building this based on the idea that productivity shouldn't feel like a second job or a privacy trade-off.\n\n**What makes Habit Stack stand out:**\n\n* **Total Privacy:** 100% offline. No accounts, no data leaves your phone.\n* **Zero-Stress Gamification:** Hatch and level up pets through your progress without social pressure or complex 'guilds'.\n* **GitHub-style Analytics:** Beautiful heatmaps to visualize your consistency throughout the year.\n* **Fair Monetization:** You can unlock everything and remove ads just by earning 'discipline points' through actual consistency.\n\nI’ve been updating the app frequently based on user feedback to streamline the UX and improve performance. I'm now looking for the Product Hunt community's keen eyes to help me take it to the next level for 2026.\n\n**Find it on** [https://www.producthunt.com/products/habit-stack-gamified-habit-tracker](https://www.producthunt.com/products/habit-stack-gamified-habit-tracker)\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on the concept and the onboarding experience.

      "text": "Three weeks ago, someone asked: \"Should you keep building Notion templates?\"\n\nI froze.\n\nI'd launched 13 products. Had systems tracking everything, tasks completed, hours worked, post engagement, free downloads. I could tell you my exact productivity metrics for any given week.\n\nBut I couldn't answer their actual question with any confidence.\n\n**What my data showed me**\n\nI finally sat down and calculated what actually mattered:\n\n* HealthOS: $0.56 revenue per view (12 sales / 379 views / $19.98 price)\n* PolymathOS: $0.07 revenue per view (22 sales / 1,393 views / $4.99 price)\n* InfluencerOS: $0.30 revenue per view (8 sales / 231 views / $8.99 price)\n\nHealthOS had 1/4 the traffic but made 2.2X more money than PolymathOS.\n\nThe product I'd barely promoted was my best performer. By a lot.\n\nBut I'd been celebrating PolymathOS because it had more views.\n\n**The gap I didn't see**\n\nI had systems for everything:\n\n* WritersOS for my novels\n* PoetryOS for my poems\n* PolymathOS for managing learning across 12 different interests\n* HealthOS (built after my asthma diagnosis last July)\n\nEach solved a real problem in my life. Each helped me survive my own chaos.\n\nBut none of them told me which offers were actually profitable. Which marketing channels had real ROI. Whether I was building a business or just staying busy.\n\nI could track what I *did*. I couldn't see what *worked*.\n\n**What I actually needed**\n\nNot another productivity system. I needed to answer economic questions:\n\n* Which offers are profitable after I account for time and delivery costs?\n* Should I price at $4.99 or $19.98? (Turns out higher price converted better)\n* Is my email funnel working or am I just collecting addresses?\n* Where should I actually spend my time today? What moved the needle?\n\nMy systems gave me activity metrics. I needed business intelligence.\n\n**What I built instead**\n\nSpent the last two months building SolopreneurOS — not as another template to sell, but as the instrumentation I desperately needed.\n\nIt's structured around 11 interconnected modules that work together through Notion relations and rollups:\n\n* **Business Architect** \\- Map your business model, unit economics per offer, and growth roadmap so every decision ties back to strategy and margins\n* **Execution Engine** \\- Auto-score tasks by impact/effort/energy and track execution velocity so you work on what actually moves revenue\n* **Offer Development Lab** \\- Systematize validation experiments with decision rules before you scale, plus post-launch optimization tracking\n* **Marketing Command** \\- Campaign planning with channel-level ROI (CTR, CPA, ROAS) so you see which marketing actually converts to revenue, not just engagement\n* **Content Engine** \\- Score ideas by opportunity, track content through production pipeline, measure performance by platform and conversion (would've shown me which Reddit posts drove sales)\n* **Client & Partner CRM** \\- Lead scoring based on fit/intent/engagement, revenue forecasting, partnership commission tracking, and client churn-risk formulas\n* **Finance Hub** \\- Real P&L with revenue recognition, COGS tracking per offer, expense categorization, burn rate, and runway calculation (this is what showed me HealthOS's actual margins)\n* **Knowledge Hub** \\- Track learning with application records and measured impact ROI so you know which courses or skills actually paid off\n* **Reflection & Optimization** \\- Weekly review system with KPI monitoring, anomaly detection for spikes/drops, and prioritized improvement planning\n* **Founder Operating System** \\- Energy logging with recovery metrics, habit tracking with consistency scores, and life domain balance visibility\n* **Legal & Compliance Hub** \\- Contract vault with expiry tracking, compliance calendar, policy library, and IP protection management\n\nEverything connects through Notion relations and rollups. Your offers feed your finance hub. Your marketing rolls up to revenue. Your tasks tie to actual business outcomes.\n\n**The moment I knew it worked**\n\nLast week, same question: \"Should you keep building templates?\"\n\nThis time I had an answer in 30 seconds:\n\n\"Yes. Double down on HealthOS and anything solving urgent pain. Cut vanity products. HealthOS converts at 3.2% vs 1.6% industry average and commands 4X the price. The margin story is clear.\"\n\nZero hesitation. Zero guessing.\n\nThat's what changed.\n\n**What makes this different from my other templates**\n\nMy other systems help you manage parts of your life, writing, learning, health, poetry.\n\nSolopreneurOS is business infrastructure. It's the system that tells you if your other systems (or offers, or marketing, or time allocation) are actually working.\n\nIt's not pretty dashboards. It's economic truth:\n\n* Profit margins per offer (with COGS calculations)\n* Task priority scores based on actual business impact\n* Marketing ROI by channel (email, Reddit, X, ProductHunt)\n* Burn rate and runway visibility\n* Client health scores and churn risk\n\nAll the metrics I needed to stop flying blind.\n\n**What I'm uncertain about**\n\nLaunching on ProductHunt today and honestly nervous about a few things:\n\nIs this too niche? Most people want productivity systems. This specifically solves for solopreneurs who need economic clarity.\n\nIs 11 modules overwhelming? It's comprehensive because businesses are complex, but does it feel like too much at first glance?\n\nDoes anyone else feel this gap? Productive but economically blind?\n\n**The uncomfortable pattern**\n\nI spent 6 months optimizing for:\n\n* Post engagement (thousands of views)\n* Free downloads (2,294 on Notion Marketplace)\n* Content output (13 products shipped)\n\nBut I was blind to:\n\n* Unit economics (which offers were actually profitable)\n* True conversion rates (views that became revenue)\n* Time ROI (was I working on high-leverage activities?)\n\nI was measuring activity. I needed to measure outcomes.\n\nSolopreneurOS is what I built when I realized my productivity systems were lying to me about what mattered.\n\n**The question I'm still asking**\n\nIf you've ever frozen when someone asked \"how's the business actually doing?\" or worked incredibly hard without knowing if it mattered economically, I'm genuinely curious how you think about measurement.\n\nBecause I built 13 products before I realized I was optimizing the wrong metrics. And it took building an entirely different kind of system to see it.\n\nLaunching on ProductHunt tomorrow if anyone wants to check it out. Thank you very much for dropping by and reading till the end!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jctb68ey1vbg1.png?width=1897&format=png&auto=webp&s=83bd5ceb0bc99ca25fe3dc1943889aded9ca3702\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1q66vhc/video/wj2xzbks1vbg1/player\n\n\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1q66vhc/video/wyn7vw1v1vbg1/player\n\n",

But they do matter—a lot.\nSo no, ‘being the fastest’ isn’t a problem.\nThe problem is thinking that performance is a detail when it’s what unlocks the future of the product.”",
