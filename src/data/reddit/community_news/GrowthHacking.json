Most people clicking into your app from ads are hitting terrible in-app browsers that kill signup rates.\n\nInstagram and Facebook browsers are conversion poison. No credit card autofills, no Apple Pay, super slow load times. My last product saw 1.2% conversion in those browsers vs 4% in Safari.\n\nQuick fix is routing users to their native browser before checkout. Saw a 15% revenue boost just from that redirect. Definitely check your analytics by browser type.\n\nIf Instagram or Facebook traffic converts way lower than Safari, that's your growth leak. https://tryhoox.com handles this automatically if you want to test it out.\n\nSolid work on the app btw. Mobile editing is a killer problem to solve.",

Then slice it by source (ASO vs Instagram/TikTok vs referrals) and by device. You’ll quickly see which step is leaking for which channel.\n\n\n\nOn paid traffic, the in-app browser thing is real for web flows, but for an app like this I’d lean hard into deep links that jump straight to the App Store instead of a landing page when coming from IG/FB/TikTok. If you ever spin up a separate web paywall or pro plan, then something like tryhoox, Branch, and even Pulse for Reddit come in handy: Branch for sane deep links, tryhoox for redirecting trash browsers, and Pulse for Reddit to spot threads where people complain about mobile editing pain and reply with real examples.\n\n\n\nThe main point: instrument everything around that first export and fix drops step by step instead of guessing from top-line downloads.",

      "text": "  \n\n\nGoogle search results are shifting toward AI-generated answers. If ChatGPT or Perplexity doesn't mention your brand, you're losing traffic.\n\nMy team looked at 1,000 pages ranking for high-intent keywords like \"pricing,\" \"vs,\" and \"alternatives.\" We found a clear pattern for winning AI citations. [Here's data proof](https://youtu.be/ZvpNEPWVzCI), the breakdown and how to automated.\n\n**Real people get the clicks.**\n\nAI bots crave trust. They're programmed to avoid making things up (well, they try not to anyways lol), so they look for verified experts. 72.4% of top-ranking pages have a clear author byline. Use Author Schema. It tells the bot exactly who wrote the piece and why they're qualified.\n\n**Feed the bot its favorite format.**\n\nLLMs love questions and answers. It's how they learn. Pages ranking for \"pricing\" terms use FAQ blocks twice as often as other sites. Don't hide your data in long paragraphs. Use FAQ Schema. This gives the AI a clean snippet to copy-paste into an answer.\n\n**Build a map.**\n\nA Table of Contents helps. It sounds simple. Yet, 27% of top \"Alternatives\" pages use them to organize complex data. This structure helps a crawler understand how your sections relate to each other. If the AI can't map your page, it won't summarize it.\n\n**The clock is ticking.**\n\nAI search tools prioritize recent data. Over 43% of winning \"Alternatives\" pages show a recently updated date. If your post looks old, the AI will skip it for a newer source. Update your timestamps.\n\n**Every intent has a fingerprint.**\n\nEach keyword type requires a different layout. \"Pricing\" pages need CTAs above the fold—89% of them do. \"Review\" pages need massive authority. The average one we studied has 93,000 backlinks. You can't use one template for every keyword and expect to win.\n\nStop optimizing for a list of blue links. Optimize for the context window. If you make it hard for the AI to find your data, it'll just cite your competitor.",

If your profile makes it clear what you do, the right ones reach out on their own.

Not \"helpful as a strategy\" but genuinely useful. People can smell the difference. If your comment could be replaced with a link to your landing page it's not good enough.\n\nBiggest lesson so far: one real conversation in a DM with a founder who told me exactly when he'd pay for my service taught me more about my market than 6 months of guessing.

That keeps the signal high and avoids chasing karma.\n\nI’d start tagging DMs in a simple sheet (problem, budget, urgency, how they found you). After 20–30 of those, patterns jump out: phrases people repeat, trigger events, how they frame success. That’s gold for refining your offer and future replies.\n\nTool-wise, I’ve used F5bot and Mention for keyword alerts, and lately Pulse for Reddit on top to catch high-intent threads fast without camping in search all day.\n\nMain point again: dial in a tiny set of pains and show up consistently with real answers; the right leads find you.",

The companies I've seen actually generate pipeline from Reddit are engaging in 3-5+ relevant conversations every single day, which is where it becomes a real time sink.  \n  \nThe math works out though. Even in smaller B2B subreddits you've got maybe 10-15 solid opportunities daily during business hours. If you're leaving genuinely helpful comments with a subtle link where it makes sense, you're looking at 2-5% click-through rates.  \n  \nThat compounds to like 50-200 qualified visits monthly, and those convert way better than cold traffic because the person literally asked for help with teh exact problem you solve. The tricky part is most marketers try this for a few weeks, realize it's a grind, and either burn out or start cutting corners and get banned. Some companies just outsource the whole thing to a done-for-you service instead of trying to manage it in-house.  \n  \nI came across Community Mentions (https://communitymentions.com) recently and they basically handle the research, posting, and making sure you don't get flagged for self-promo. Makes sense for teams that don't have bandwidth to stay on top of Reddit daily but still want the organic visibility.",

SEO is the rare channel that compounds, content you publish today keeps generating leads in month 6, month 12, month 24\n\nthe founders making this work are running it like a proper growth system:\n\nthey hunt low-competition, high-intent keywords from day one. not \"what is X\" vanity traffic — \"best X alternative\" and \"X pricing\" buying-intent stuff\n\nthey use AI to scale content production. yeah... \"AI content is bad\" but paired with real expertise it works. Claude, ChatGPT, whatever. programmatic SEO (pSEO) lets you rank for hundreds of long-tail keywords without writing each one manually — that's a growth hack in itself\n\nthey build free tools as link magnets. Bhanu Teja from India scaled his SaaS to **$13k MRR** using SEO + free tools. people share and link to useful free tools organically\n\nlinks → domain authority → rankings → inbound leads → revenue\n\n**the compounding math:**\n\n* month 1: almost nothing\n* month 6: a trickle\n* month 12: hundreds of qualified visitors/day with zero ongoing CAC\n\nthe CAC for a lead coming from a 12-month-old article is basically $0. that's a unit economics story that's hard to beat\n\nthe disadvantage is the feedback loop is slow. most growth teams optimize for speed and that's fair. but if you're early stage and don't have budget to outspend competitors on paid, this is the asymmetric bet\n\nyou're trading time upfront for a moat later. most of your competitors won't have the patience. that's the actual growth hack\n\nNico, [zignalify](https://zignalify.com) founder",

      "text": "Everyone says \"just build something.\" Spent 2 years testing 9 different product types to see what actually generates revenue for solo builders. Directories, templates, newsletters, courses, blogs, boilerplates, services, micro SaaS, and communities. Only 2 consistently made money without burning out. The rest either took too long or had terrible margins. Tested curated directories first after seeing Cyberleads make $500K annually and Theresanaiforthat monetize through listing fees. Built 3 directories in different niches. Revenue after 6 months was $340 total. The problem is everyone can copy your curation in hours. No moat. Listings dried up fast. Moved on.\n\nTried Notion templates next because Easlo makes over $1M annually selling them. Created 12 template packs. Made $890 in 4 months then sales stopped. Canva and Notion's built-in galleries made discovery impossible. Template marketplaces are saturated. Unless you have massive audience, templates don't work anymore. Started newsletter thinking I'd get sponsorships like others making $2K monthly. Grew to 2,400 subscribers over 8 months. Got zero sponsorship offers. Realized you need 10K+ subscribers minimum for brands to care. Quit because effort-to-revenue ratio was terrible. Built online course because Max Haining runs successful ones. Spent 6 weeks creating content. Sold 8 copies for $1,120 total. Course creation takes forever and selling requires huge audience or paid ads budget I didn't have. Not viable for bootstrappers starting from zero.\n\nWhat actually worked was micro SaaS and productized services. Built simple micro SaaS solving specific problem using boilerplate from FounderToolkit in 4 weeks. Hit $4,200 monthly revenue by month 3. Launched productized design service at fixed $2,500 per project. Booked 5 projects in 2 months making $12,500. Both had clear value propositions and customers willing to pay immediately.​ [Studied patterns in FounderToolkit database comparing 1,000+ builders across these product types](http://foundertoolkit.org). Micro SaaS and productized services had highest success rates for solo builders because they solve immediate painful problems, customers pay real money upfront, margins stay high, and moats exist through execution quality. Directories and templates are races to the bottom.​\n\nThe controversial truth is most product types work only if you already have audience. Micro SaaS and services work even starting from zero because you're selling solutions, not attention. Build products that solve problems customers pay for today, not products hoping for traffic someday.​\n\nStop copying product types that work for influencers with 50K followers. Build what works for solo builders with zero audience.\n\nWhat product type are you building? Does it actually work without existing audience?",

Do 3–5 done-for-you projects, write down every single boring step, then ask: what can be turned into a button, what can be turned into a script, what should stay service? That way you don’t waste 4 weeks building features nobody pays for.\n\nFor distribution, I’d double down on where people complain in public: Reddit, niche Slack/Discords, comments under competitor tools. Stuff like Apollo + simple cold email for services, a basic landing page on Tally/Gumroad for pre-sales, and tools like TweetHunter or Pulse for Reddit to surface live pain-convos make this repeatable.\n\nCore point stands: sell painful fixes, not formats that only work once you’re internet-famous.",

      "text": "For the past few months, I’ve been building my SaaS product completely solo. That means nights and weekends spent coding, marketing, and everything in between. No team, no virtual assistants, and no agencies, just me, my laptop, and plenty of coffee.\n\nThis past month felt like a real turning point for me. I got 2,150 organic visitors to my site, which led to 31 trial signups and ultimately 7 paying customers. That brought in $2,795 in revenue, which averages out to about $1.3 per visitor. And the best part is, I didn’t spend a single dollar on ads.\n\nSo, what made the difference? Let me walk you through the tools and strategies that really moved the needle.\n\nI used [Typedream](http://typedream.com/) to build my homepage and pricing pages quickly. It only took me about two hours, and everything was SEO-friendly and mobile responsive without any complicated coding or design headaches.\n\nFor backlink building, I relied on [GetMoreBacklinks.org](http://getmorebacklinks.org/). Manually submitting my website to hundreds of startup directories would have taken me around 20 hours, but with this tool, I did it in one click. My domain rating jumped from zero to six, and Google indexed my site in just four days, which gave me some crucial early momentum.\n\nTo support content marketing, I used [PostKit](http://postkit.pro/) to post two blog articles targeting keywords with low competition. One of those posts ranked in the top 30 search results within 10 days. I also kept a public changelog to show that the project is alive and active, which helped build trust and conversions.\n\nFor onboarding, I set up a simple five-step drip email sequence using [MailMaestro](https://www.maestrolabs.com/). I welcomed new users, shared helpful tips on features, highlighted testimonials, showcased a mini case study, and asked for feedback. This sequence played a big role in turning 31 trial users into paying customers.\n\nThe biggest lessons I learned are not to chase flashy tools but to pick simple, reliable ones that help you work without friction. Despite not being glamorous, directory backlinks are still effective. Slow and consistent growth beats flashy viral hacks. And most importantly, your goal should be revenue per visitor, not just traffic.\n\nIf you want, I’m happy to share email templates, blog outlines, and even the keywords I focused on. This month was my first time making real profit as a solo founder, and I’m finally starting to feel momentum.",

The $1.3 per visitor number is interesting because it highlights something most people overlook -- when you're not spending on ads, your traffic quality tends to be much higher because those visitors are finding you through intent-based searches.\n\n\n\nCouple things I'd add from similar experience:\n\n\n\nThe drip email sequence is doing more heavy lifting than most people realize. Seven paying customers from 31 trials is a 22% conversion rate, which is actually quite strong for SaaS. That tells me your onboarding emails are probably nailing the timing on when to showcase value vs when to ask for the upgrade. Would be curious what your email open rates look like across the sequence.\n\n\n\nOn the SEO side, the low competition keyword strategy is exactly right at this stage. Too many founders waste months trying to rank for competitive terms when there are hundreds of specific long-tail queries nobody is targeting. Two posts ranking in top 30 within 10 days is proof of that.\n\n\n\nOne thing I'd think about as you scale: the directory backlink approach works great for the initial authority boost, but it has diminishing returns. As you hit DA 10-15, you'll want to shift toward earning links from content partnerships and guest contributions on industry blogs. That's where the compounding really kicks in.",

Traditional SEO won't disappear but it's definitely not the whole game anymore.\n\nFrom what I've been researching, the key difference is that Al models pull from a much wider context than just meta descriptions and backlinks. They're synthesizing information from multiple sources to form recommendations, so your brand needs to be consistently represented across the web in ways that Al can understand and trust. That means authoritative content, third-party mentions, clear positioning, all that stuff.\n\nBut here's the kicker: you have no idea what these LLMs are actually saying about you unless you're actively monitoring them. I came across Brandlight (https://brandlight.ai) while digging into this exact problem. They specifically help you track how your brand shows up in Al-generated answers and alert you when something's off or missing.\n\nSeems like a good fit for what you're trying to solve since you mentioned wanting visibility into LLM mentions. Way more focused than the general SEO tools that are just bolting on Al features as an afterthought. As for the \"\"how do I get noticed\" question, it's less about pumping out blog posts and more about making sure your existing content is structured in a way that Al can cite confidently.\n\nThink FAQs, comparitive content, clear use cases, customer stories. Make it easy for the model to understand who you are and why you're relevent to specific queries. measuring success is tricky right now since there's no PageRank equivalent yet, but tracking share of voice in Al responses is probably the closest analog.",

      "text": "I sold my previous startup after growing it to 7 figures with Facebook ads.\n\nNow I am doing it again with my new project\n\nWe just hit $321,000 ARR.\n\nThe secret wasn't a complex algorithm hack or a magical audience list.\n\nIt was the offer.\n\nMost SaaS founders are stuck on the standard 14 day free trial.\n\nI think that is a mistake because there is no urgency.\n\nIn my previous company I used a free plus shipping model.\n\nI gave away crafting supplies and charged small shipping fees.\n\nThen I upsold them immediately.\n\nIt is easier to convince 10 people to pay a small amount than to get users to convert from a boring free trial.\n\nIt changes the relationship from a user to a buyer.\n\nFor Rebelgrowth I adapted this into two types of offers.\n\nThe first is the price hook: a 3 day free trial and the first month for just $9.\n\nThe regular price is $97 and kicks in on month two.\n\nThis works because it stops the scroll and catches people off guard.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be about discounting. In most cases you will actually want to avoid discounting because it attracts lower quality customers.\n\nThe second approach is a key differentiator.\n\nOur platform repurposes content into 13 social media platforms automatically. Something none of our competitors do.\n\nWhen your product solves a massive pain point like that, your ad becomes an easy sell.\n\nWhile we use programmatic SEO and YouTube influencers, Meta ads are our main engine.\n\nBut I see people overcomplicating them every day.\n\nHere is my exact setup.\n\nFirst, get your tracking right.\n\nYou need the Conversion API setup with a score of at least 6 out of 10.\n\nOptimize for the Subscription Paid event so Facebook finds actual buyers.\n\nSecond, stop messing with targeting.\n\nYour creative is your targeting.\n\nThe algorithm is smart enough to find your people if your ad speaks to them.\n\nI target broad.\n\nI start with the US and Tier A countries like the UK, Australia and Canada.\n\nI run only two campaigns.\n\nOne main campaign for cold traffic and one retargeting campaign to address specific objections.\n\nThe best ads for us are UGC style, 15 to 30 seconds max.\n\nThe hook is everything.\n\nI use AI tools to iterate on the hooks and reuse the core video.\n\nIf you have a winning ad just change the first 3 seconds.\n\nI have upsells in place like a $299 plan for higher service levels.\n\nEnough people take the upsell to cover the cost of the ads.\n\nYou need to know your numbers.\n\nI track everything in a spreadsheet: CPM, CPC, conversion rates, and churn.\n\nThis gives me the confidence to spend money because I know exactly when I will make it back.\n\nMost founders focus on the product and treat marketing as an afterthought.\n\nI think the offer and the funnel are king.\n\nFix the offer and the ads will work.\n\nCheers,  \nBorja from [rebelgrowth.com](http://rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit)\n\nP.s. if you need help figuring out a good offer or differentiating angle drop your project and I'll do my best to give some ideas",

Think: “here’s the pain that pushed me to build this,” “here’s what almost killed it,” “here’s the one moment I almost quit.” Then I reuse the same core story across channels but tune the angle: more emotional on LinkedIn, more tactical on Reddit, more data-driven in email. That way it still feels human but not like I’m trauma-dumping for clicks.\n\n\n\nTactically, two things moved the needle: 1) a small DM list of “day-one champions” I’d helped before launch, with clear asks and assets; 2) jumping into every live convo that mentioned our problem space instead of screaming into the void. I’ve used things like SparkToro and manual Twitter/X searches for that, and lately tools like PhantomBuster and Pulse for Reddit help surface the handful of threads actually worth showing up in.\n\n\n\nSo yeah: lead with a real story, then systemize how you place it in front of the right conversations.",

      "text": "Posting for eleven months straight. 330 videos live. Every one stuck between 210 and 380 views. Never breaking through. Started thinking maybe growth on this platform just isn't meant for me.\n\nI'm completely exhausted. Eleven months of daily effort and nothing's changed. Started believing maybe I'm missing some critical understanding that everyone else has.\n\nConvinced myself my account was permanently suppressed. That the algorithm flagged me as low quality early on. That maybe wiping everything and starting over was my only shot.\n\nThen I stopped guessing randomly and learned what actually kills retention. Went from 295 average to 84k in just under three weeks. These are the things I learned that made me improve my content:\n\n**Technical:**\n\n* Lighting has to be really good for the video to look professional. I was using natural light from windows thinking it was fine. It wasn't. Invested in actual lighting equipment and the quality difference was massive.\n* Clean audio is essential for credibility. Fuzzy or inconsistent audio makes people click away immediately. Upgraded my recording setup and people started watching longer.\n* Something visual needs to change every few seconds. I was using static shots for way too long. People got disinterested and scrolled. Started adding constant visual variety and they stayed engaged.\n\n**Social:**\n\n* Your first 2 seconds determine everything. I was starting with intros and context. People scrolled before I said anything worthwhile. Led with immediate value and they stayed.\n* Cut every pause shorter than comfortable. I was leaving gaps that felt natural in conversation. People lost interest during those moments. Tightened everything and retention jumped.\n* Deliver your point within the first 10 seconds. I was taking too long to get there. People didn't stick around. Front-loaded the value and they watched through.\n\n**Algorithmic:**\n\n* More uploads don't fix broken retention. I was posting twice daily hoping volume would help. It didn't change anything. Fixed retention first and then frequency started working.\n* Hashtags are nearly useless compared to retention. I researched tags carefully every time. Total waste. If the test audience doesn't watch your video hashtags can't save it.\n* The algorithm tests every video on a small batch first. If they leave early it stops there. Everything else you optimize is pointless until that batch watches.\n\nWhat helped me the most was using [this app](https://taap.it/liyjQBu). In 30 seconds, it tells me exactly what's wrong with my videos and what to change to get more views. Changed everything for me. Regular analytics showed problems but never how to actually solve them.\n\nLast 9 videos all over 81k. Same content style. Just fixed what was actually breaking retention.\n\nIf you've been stuck at low views for nearly a year you're solving the wrong problems.",

Otherwise none of this will work.\n\nWe run a cold email for a few Saas and service businesses, Ycom funded as well.\n\nIf done right, cold email can be the most reliable and predictable sales channel. Would love to share my lessons/tips if they can give anyone a head start.\n\nSome of this was obvious, a lot less so.\n\n**Offer**\n\nFriction is the death - reduce as much as possible. Dont as for people time - give them value. Something like \"Here's a free tool that solves your exact problem. Reply 'yes' and I'll send you the signup link\"\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\nBuy 6-10 separate domains just for outreach. Use variations of your brand. Warm them up on Instantly (keep this simple) - for more scale run 2 separate infrastructure sets, odd set and even set - they send on alternate days- but each has the ability to take on the full load if needed.\n\nWithout good deliverability - all the other effort goes to zero\n\n**Data**\n\nYou need good data and a lot of it.\n\nA. Export large set of filtered data from data source (e.g. Pitchbook, Crunchbase)  \nB. Identify key decision makers via Apollo  \nC. Cleanse email data with Reoon\n\nThen scrape each website and give it to ai to check ICP fit for the company and your offering - more than 10% of companies in your list will be mis-tagged by Apollo - it's important to weed them out at this stage to better deliverability and PMF. You can use clay here.\n\n**Some Quirks**\n\nThese are not make or break, rather they are all good to have - \n\nPlain text only. No HTML, no images, no fancy formatting.\n\nUse spintax for variety: {Hey|Hi|Hello} {{first\\_name}},\n\nTesting insight: Subject lines matter way less than you think for cold email, the first line matters 10x more.\n\nOnly metrics that matter - +ve reply rate and Inbox delivery rate\n\n**Start small. Test. Scale what works.**\n\nhopefully this helps (please upvote and comment so others can see)",

          "text": "This is a masterclass in reducing **'Systemic Noise.'** Most people think cold email is a volume game, but your 500k send-run proves it’s actually a **Digital Logistics** problem.\n\nThe most underrated point here is using AI to verify ICP-fit by scraping websites. In my research on the **'Retrieval Loop,'** I’ve found that over 10% of entities are 'misunderstood' by automated databases (like Apollo) because their **Summary Integrity** has collapsed. By using AI to check the *actual* site content vs. the database tag, you’re essentially performing a manual **'Entity Triangulation'** before hitting 'send.' This is why your deliverability stays high—the relevance is mathematically solid.\n\nAlso, your 'Plain Text' rule is a great nudge toward **Asymmetric Firmness**. AI-driven inbox filters are becoming as sophisticated as LLM search engines; they’re trained to sniff out 'marketing posture' (HTML/images). Factual, boring, declarative text isn't just a choice—it’s a survival strategy to stay out of the 'Spam/Ignored' bucket.\n\n**Quick question on the 'Mis-tagged' data:** When the AI flags a company as a bad fit despite the database saying otherwise, is it usually because of **'Adjective Creep'** (the company uses vague language on their site) or just outdated 'dark data' in the source?\n\nAppreciate the 500k-scale reality check!",

Most people obsess over clever lines while sending junk data from a burnt domain to a half–relevant ICP.\n\n\n\nOne thing I’d add to your data flow: after Apollo + Reoon, tag prospects by “moment in time” (just raised, just hired X role, just launched feature, etc.) and tailor the offer to that trigger. Same script, different angle, reply rates jump.\n\n\n\nAlso worth building a ruthless disqualification loop: if a segment underperforms after 2–3 micro-tests, kill it and re-route volume instead of “fixing” copy forever.\n\n\n\nFor finding fresh pockets of pain to turn into offers, I’ve used Clay plus LinkedIn Sales Nav, and lately tools like PhantomBuster; Pulse for Reddit is handy for surfacing threads where target buyers are already ranting about the exact problem you’re solving, which makes the “here’s a free tool” angle land way harder.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, ops + data discipline beats clever writing here.",

Start at 50/day for 2 weeks, then scale. We've seen teams burn through domains by going 0→500/day immediately.\n\nAlso: reply detection matters more than opens.

In practice, many people overestimate \"new AEO tools\" - a basic stack like GSC + Bing Webmaster + log analysis + brand mention/citation tracking already gives you strong monthly views without spending $500+. Paid trackers now sell \"narrative\" more than unique data, so first build your own visibility metrics in AI responses, and only then decide if you need expensive software",

It's specifically designed for tracking brand mentions in AI responses and gives you visibility into what chatbots are actually saying about you.\n\nFrom what I've read it also shows you where you're missing from answers you should be in, which is huge for figuring out your content gaps.

Most people build 'prisons' because their business relies 100% on their manual labor.\nTo be direct, the strategy is built on three core pillars that move you from 'Prison' to 'Scale' within the Digital Real Estate sector:\n * Asset Acquisition: We don't trade hours for dollars. We build or acquire digital assets (like high-traffic websites, automated lead-gen properties, or niche platforms) that hold value and generate income 24/7.\n * Systemization: We strip away the manual tasks. Once a digital property is set up, we use automation and AI to manage the 'upkeep,' so you aren't stuck behind a desk.\n * High-Margin Leverage: Unlike physical real estate, there are no 'pipes to fix' or physical tenants to manage. We focus on digital assets with 90%+ profit margins.\nSince you mentioned you’ll have the capital ready in a few days, I’m happy to give you the specific roadmap for how I'm scaling my Digital Real Estate portfolio now.\nAre you ready to see the exact breakdown of how we execute this, or do you have a specific question about one of those three pillars first?",

Knowing well myself how difficult it is to get people to visit your profile on X, these are some pretty good results. Today the impressions are maxing out, but over time, the algorithm will place the content where it should go, and it's going to show it to people even after some time has passed. Combine all of this with also creating some threads, even though OP thinks it's not a good idea, and then you have a very good strategy. When people actually do visit your profile, they should be able to see something else, something different. Preferably also something useful for them. But that's, you know, besides the point. If you are unable to get impressions, you won't be able to get visits. If you're unable to get visits, you won't be able to get traffic.

Here’s the short version after comparing the common options.\n\n**ZoomInfo**  \nBest if you’re running a more enterprise GTM/ABM motion and want deeper company intel.  \nDownside: pricing and contracts can be heavy for smaller teams.\n\n**Apollo**  \nGood if you want something that’s easy for reps to use and you also want outreach in the same place.  \nDownside: data quality can be hit or miss depending on market, and per-seat costs add up as you grow.\n\n**People Data Labs (PDL)**  \nStrong if you’re technical and want an API-first data source for automation, custom ICP filters, enrichment, and building your own workflows.  \nDownside: not really a “nice UI” tool. You need engineering/automation to get the most value.\n\n**Cognism**  \nWorth a look if you sell in EU/UK and care a lot about compliance and verified phone numbers.  \nDownside: tends to be priced for bigger teams.\n\n**Lusha**  \nUseful for quick enrichment when you already have a lead and want contact details fast (often via extension).  \nDownside: not ideal for building large lists from scratch.\n\n**Breeze Intelligence (Clearbit/HubSpot)**  \nMakes sense if you live inside HubSpot and want inbound enrichment and scoring.  \nDownside: less useful if your main goal is outbound list building.\n\nQuick rule of thumb I ended up with:  \n\\- Enterprise ABM: ZoomInfo  \n\\- Outbound + reps want a simple workflow: Apollo  \n\\- API + automation + custom filters: PDL  \n\\- EU/UK phone data: Cognism  \n\\- Quick enrichment: Lusha  \n\\- HubSpot inbound enrichment: Breeze\n\nSmall note: there are tools starting to sit on top of these providers and combine sources so you can do ICP search, enrichment, and scoring in one flow. Starnus is one of those and the one I've been using in the past few weeks.\n\nCurious to know about your perspective and which data sources you use for your outbound sourcing?",
