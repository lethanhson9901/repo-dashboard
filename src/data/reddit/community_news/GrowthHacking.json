I started treating documentation as part of the experiment loop. I’ve been keeping hypotheses, results, and decisions in one place using **Notion**, and I also have access to a **free 3-month startup trial that includes Notion AI**, which I mainly use to summarize experiment outcomes and clean up thinking between iterations.\n\nThis didn’t magically create growth.  \nBut it stopped us from wasting cycles.\n\nIf you’ve run experiments that didn’t move the needle, what do you think actually broke?  \nI’d like to hear how others make learnings compound.",

Dedicated domain, SPF, DKIM, DMARC aligned, low complaint rate, zero list risk. Look into SMTP services like Mailtrap, Mailgun, SMT2Go, etc. \n\n\\-Cold outreach is inherently risky. Even if you do it “right,” complaints and bounces happen. Keep that blast radius isolated so it never touches critical emails. Use a different email service provider for that. \n\n\\-Warm up of email: especially if you self-host or use providers that allow custom IPs. Warm transactional slowly and never mix it with promos during warm-up.  \n\nSo, protect transactional at all costs, and assume cold will eventually get you in trouble.",

      "text": "Spent January through June testing every growth tactic from blogs and Twitter threads. Tracked every dollar and hour invested with actual ROI calculations. Out of 9 tactics, only 1 was profitable. The other 8 were negative ROI or break-even at best. Here's the honest breakdown nobody shares.\n\nWhat failed with actual numbers: Facebook ads spent $2,100 getting 12 customers at $175 CAC, LTV is $140 = negative $420 total. Referral program built for $400 and 20 hours, generated 3 referrals in 5 months = negative ROI. Growth loops took 30 hours to build, 8% of users engaged, zero viral growth = wasted time. Twitter posting daily for 4 months, grew 890 followers, converted 1 customer = negative ROI counting time. Partnership outreach sent 140 emails, closed 2 partnerships bringing 4 customers over 3 months = barely break-even.​\n\nWhat actually worked: SEO blog content. Invested $0 cash, 60 hours writing 18 posts over 6 months. Started ranking month 3, now brings 15-20 signups weekly growing monthly. Customer acquisition cost is $0, return is infinite. Currently at $4.1K MRR with 78% from organic search.\n\nThe growth hacking reality: most tactics sound good but have terrible economics for bootstrapped startups. They work at scale with budgets and teams, not at $0-5K MRR with solo founders. Everyone shares what they're trying, nobody shares what actually made money versus lost money.​\n\nPulled data from [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) comparing growth tactics across 180 bootstrapped SaaS to validate my experience. Pattern was clear: 73% of successful ones under $10K MRR relied primarily on SEO and organic community engagement. Only 12% made paid acquisition work profitably before $15K MRR. Tactics that require budget or scale don't work until you have budget and scale.\n\nThe controversial truth: stop growth hacking and just do boring SEO consistently for 6 months. One profitable channel beats nine break-even tactics. Most growth hackers are broke because they chase tactics instead of ROI.​\n\nWhat's your actual ROI on growth tactics? Be honest with real numbers.",

Tried all the \"sexy\" growth hacks first Product Hunt launch, cold outreach, paid communities. Got some initial traffic spikes but nothing stuck.\n\n\n\nThen we did something most growth hackers skip because it's not exciting. Directory submissions. Sounds outdated but here's what actually happened.\n\n\n\nWeek 1-2 was pure setup. Got our site submitted to 200+ active SaaS and startup directories. Not the spammy 2015 directories, modern ones that Google actually crawls regularly. Used [GetMoreBacklinks](http://getmorebacklinks.org) to automate the bulk work since manual submission would've killed an entire week.\n\n\n\nWeek 3-6 was the waiting game. Nothing dramatic happened immediately which is why most people give up. But our crawl frequency in Search Console started increasing. Google was discovering our pages faster because we had legit inbound signals.\n\n\n\nWeek 7-12 is when it clicked. Domain authority went from 0 to 28. Started ranking for 47 longtail keywords we weren't ranking for at all before. Organic traffic hit 800 visits per month and it's still climbing weekly.\n\n\n\nThe growth hack nobody wants to hear is that boring systematic work beats clever tactics. Directory submissions gave us the authority baseline that made everything else work faster. Our content now ranks in days instead of months because Google already trusts our domain.\n\n\n\nIf you're starting from zero authority, stop chasing viral moments. Build your foundation first.

I've definitely been there, trying the latest tactic only to see a tiny blip and then back to crickets.\n\n\n\nThat whole directory submission thing sounds almost too simple, but your results speak for themselves. It's wild how much of a difference those \"boring\" backlinks can make in terms of domain authority and how Google views your site. Makes complete sense though – if Google sees legit sites linking to you, it starts to trust you more, and then your content gets a much better shot at ranking.\n\n\n\nIt’s a good reminder that sometimes the most effective strategies are the ones that require patience and consistent effort, rather than a quick, clever trick.\n\n\n\nDid you notice any particular types of directories that seemed more effective than others, or was it really just the sheer volume of quality submissions that did the heavy lifting?

Really, it’s not a ranking system we’re finding to be useful, but rather source of influence. I think in the future we’ll care less about where our client’s sites rank, and more about being a site that these AI models trust enough to pull answers from.

You're essentially trying to measure a black box.\nWhat seems to matter more (based on what people are finding) is whether your brand shows up in the training data and gets cited in authoritative sources that LLMs pull from.

They’re optimized for crawling, not for extraction and synthesis.\n\nThis is why AEO is emerging alongside SEO. You’re optimizing for how machines understand and frame you, not just where you rank.\n\nIt feels uncomfortable because we’re used to dashboards and exact numbers. But early SEO felt the same way before Search Console existed. The teams learning how AI “sees” them now will have a massive edge when real analytics finally arrive.",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI wanted to share a comprehensive price comparison of LinkedIn automation tools to help everyone make informed decisions. As a Botdog founder, we obviously research the market constantly to see how our tool stacks up and ensure we're delivering the best value. My goal is to give you an honest rundown of what's on the market, but this analysis will naturally have some bias.\n\n**TLDR: Prices range from $8.25 to $1,499/month. Linked Helper remains cheapest at $8.25/mo (with caveats), we believe Botdog offers the best value at $35/mo annually (especially for founders, individual reps, and small teams), HeyReach is arguably the best and most cost-effective option for agencies needing 30+ accounts, and CoPilot AI is still the most expensive at $203+/mo.**\n\n# Average cost of LinkedIn automation in 2026\n\nMost reliable tools now charge between $55-$165/month per user. The market has matured with clearer tier separation: budget tools ($8.25-$50/mo), mid-tier ($50-$100/mo), high ($100-$200/mo) and enterprise ($200-$1,499/mo).\n\n# Quick price rundown (annual pricing)\n\n**Budget ($8.25-$50/mo):**\n\n* **Botdog:** $35-$49/mo - Cloud-based, unlimited campaigns, best value, $49/month includes AI\n* **Linked Helper:** $8.25-$24.75/mo - Desktop-based (your computer must stay on for campaigns to run)\n* **Waalaxy Pro:** $21-$43/mo - Limited to 300 connection requests, $21/month without inbox feature\n* **Meet Alfred:** $29-$49/mo - Limited to 3 campaigns on cheaper tiers, only 3.4/5 G2 rating\n\n**Mid ($50-$100/mo):**\n\n* **Phantombuster Starter:** $56/mo - 20-hour execution limit (most need Pro at $128)\n* **HeyReach:** $59/mo - Agency-focused, overkill for solo users\n* **Dripify Pro:** $59/mo - LinkedIn + Email, unlimited campaigns\n* **Waalaxy Advanced:** $66/mo - Unlimited LinkedIn requests finally\n* **La Growth Machine Basic:** $60/mo - Only 3 campaigns, templates only\n* **Expandi Business:** $79/mo - add $118/mo for visual features = $197 total\n* **Lemlist Multichannel Expert:** $79/mo - LinkedIn + Email, 400 enrichment credits\n\n**High ($100-$200/mo):**\n\n* **La Growth Machine Pro:** $110/mo - Limited to 6 campaigns\n* **Phantombuster Pro:** $128/mo - 80-hour execution limit\n* **La Growth Machine Ultimate:** $165/mo - Unlimited campaigns finally\n* **HeyReach Agency (50 accounts):** $749/mo total ($15/account)\n\n**Enterprise ($200-$500/mo):**\n\n* **CoPilot AI:** $203-$294/mo - AI-powered, most expensive option, limited to 10 campaigns\n* **Phantombuster Team:** $352/mo - 300-hour execution limit\n* **HeyReach Unlimited:** $1,499/mo - Unlimited accounts (perfect for agencies)\n\n# My take…\n\nIf you need **LinkedIn-only automation** and want the best value: **Botdog at $35/mo** gives you unlimited campaigns, 3-minute setup, and 4.9/5 reliability at a price that won’t break the bank (but obviously I’m biased 😉).\n\n* If you need **multi-channel (LinkedIn + Email)** and want simplicity: Dripify at $59/mo or Lemlist at $79/mo (if you're email-focused) provide solid value without La Growth Machine's complexity.\n* If you're an **agency managing 50+ accounts**: HeyReach is purpose-built for your use case.\n* If you're **extremely budget-conscious** and can tolerate bugs: Meet Alfred at $49/mo is the cheapest multi-channel option, though reliability might suffer.\n* If you’re happy to **keep your computer running 24/7**: Linked Helper at $8.25-$24.75/mo might make sense.\n\nScreenshots below 👇\n\n[Botdog - $35\\/mo annually with unlimited campaigns and 3-minute setup.

Your computer has to stay on constantly, it slows everything down, and the interface feels ancient. Easy to misconfigure and accidentally spam yourself into a ban. Phantombuster is cool for scraping but gets expensive fast once you stack workflows, and you're constantly debugging why something broke. Neither feels like something I'd trust long-term on a main account.HeyReach I've seen used in a couple agency setups and that's really where it shines. Managing like 10+ accounts from one dashboard without losing your mind is the main selling point. It's also way more conservative by default, which sounds boring but probably keeps people out of trouble. You can't just crank the dials to max and hope for the best like you can with Waalaxy or Dripify.Feature-wise, the stuff that's actually useful isn't the AI gimmicks or fancy personalization tokens. It's the boring safety stuff. Clear daily limits, auto-slowdowns when engagement tanks, account health warnings. One thing I wish more tools had is smarter adaptive throttling that reacts to how LinkedIn's behaving in real time, not just static caps. That's what actually keeps accounts alive.",

Instead of reps spending half their time researching, automated that layer with tapistro.

The fastest path is anchoring the group to an existing pain point and seeding it from somewhere with built-in intent, like comments on related posts or a waitlist tied to a specific outcome. Generic groups stall fast because there is no reason to join today. What usually works is one strong hook, very tight topic scope, and visible early activity so new members do not feel like they are joining a ghost town.

Everyone’s chasing the same handful, which makes scaling campaigns a nightmare.\n\nMid-tier creators are often overlooked – Higgsfield works with \\~2,000 creators worldwide, but providing personalized support at that scale is nearly impossible. There’s a lot of talent out there, but finding the right fit is a huge challenge.\n\nFake metrics everywhere – bots, inflated views, and fake engagement are rampant. Even the old “views-to-comments” ratio doesn’t reliably indicate quality anymore. Alex calls it a social media trust crisis, and it’s easy to see why: you can’t fully verify the authenticity of most metrics on IG, TikTok, or Twitter.\n\nContext beats categories – Instead of filtering creators by broad tags like “Tech” or “SaaS,” Alex looks at what creators are actually talking about. He’s focused on intent and real engagement, not just vanity metrics.\n\nFor anyone managing influencer campaigns right now, this rings painfully true. Finding creators who actually drive conversions feels like a game of whack-a-mole—with bots, oversaturated top-tier talent, and noisy metrics everywhere.\n\nI’m curious—how is everyone else navigating this? How do you identify creators who genuinely resonate with your audience without wasting your budget chasing the obvious top-tier names?",

We were bleeding budget like everyone else, right?\n\nThen something weird happened in November. Sales guy comes to our weekly and goes \"Yo, had three demos yesterday. All three said they found us through ChatGPT.\" We're like... what? Checked the previous week. Same thing. People literally typing questions like \"best PM tool for creative teams\" into ChatGPT and our name keeps popping up in the responses.\n\nWe weren't even trying. We just existed on the internet.\n\nSo obviously I went down the rabbit hole. Spent two weeks testing every AI engine I could find - ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini. Asked hundreds of variations of buyer-intent questions in our niche.\n\nThe companies getting recommended aren't always the ones dominating Google and it blew my mind. Sometimes they're on page 2 or 3. What matters is completely different signals - how you're referenced across the web, your structured data, even how other sites contextualize your brand.\n\nThis is what people are starting to call LLM visibility - when your brand's discoverability in AI-generated responses. And right now? It's the wild west. Most companies have NO idea they're even being recommended (or ignored) by these engines.\n\nThe growth hack part. We started deliberately optimizing for this channel. Not throwing money at ads. Just strategic content + technical tweaks to make our brand \"legible\" to AI systems.\n\nAnd in 60 days our ChatGPT referral traffic went from basically zero to our third-highest demo source. CAC: $23. Yeah, you read that right.\n\nThe best part? Your competitors probably aren't even tracking this yet. They're still dumping budget into the same saturated channels while this blue ocean is sitting wide open.\n\nHas anyone else stumbled into this, or am I just getting lucky with timing?",

      "text": "I just went through Tobin Tang’s breakdown of how Wispr Flow scaled creator marketing. 80 creators, 500M+ views, ~$0.74 CPM. All in three months.\nWhat stood out wasn’t the scale, but who they worked with for product growth.\n\n- He wasn’t looking for polished UGC creators\n- He wasn’t prioritizing existing audiences\n- Many of the top performers had never posted content before\n\nInstead, he focused on people who genuinely liked the product, had time, and showed good taste.\nMost were students. Many were starting from zero. The bet was that authenticity + execution would beat “experience.” That part makes sense to me.What’s still hard is the step before any of this works.\n\n- How did he actually find these people in the first place?\n- Not creators as a category, but individuals who:\n\n  - might never have posted content\n  - don’t self-identify as “creators”\n  - could care deeply about the product\n  - have the taste and energy to grow into the role\n\n\nManually, this usually means digging through posts, comments, side projects, random mentions, and trying to infer intent from very weak signals. It’s slow, and it’s noisy.\n\nFor people here who’ve had a similar experience to Tobin’s growth hack, or who’ve tried to recruit creators from zero:\n\n- Where do you even look?\n\n- What early signals do you trust when there’s no content history?\n\n- How do you avoid relying purely on gut feeling?\n\n\nCurious how others approach this, especially when the goal is to build something long-term, not just run a one-off campaign.",

It doesn’t just find creators who already post content — it can identify complete beginners or even students with potential, by analyzing their public social media behavior and interests to see who might genuinely engage with or promote a product.\n\nYou still need to judge taste and execution in the trial phase, but it massively speeds up early-stage sourcing, letting you focus on mentoring and testing.",

Trials got a bit shorter, but not dramatic.\n\nWhere it got painful: trying to build bespoke flows for every persona/segment. Maintenance killed us after each release.

The demo exists to answer one question: “Is this worth a real conversation?” Anything beyond that belongs in onboarding or a live call.\n\nAlso agree on measuring outside the platform dashboards. Demo tools will tell you clicks and completion, but pipeline quality and sales cycle length only show up once you stitch it into your broader analytics stack.\n\nIf I were doing it again, I’d ship one narrow demo, wire it tightly to CRM outcomes, and resist the urge to keep polishing it unless it’s directly moving revenue.",
