I started treating documentation as part of the experiment loop. I’ve been keeping hypotheses, results, and decisions in one place using **Notion**, and I also have access to a **free 3-month startup trial that includes Notion AI**, which I mainly use to summarize experiment outcomes and clean up thinking between iterations.\n\nThis didn’t magically create growth.  \nBut it stopped us from wasting cycles.\n\nIf you’ve run experiments that didn’t move the needle, what do you think actually broke?  \nI’d like to hear how others make learnings compound.",

Dedicated domain, SPF, DKIM, DMARC aligned, low complaint rate, zero list risk. Look into SMTP services like Mailtrap, Mailgun, SMT2Go, etc. \n\n\\-Cold outreach is inherently risky. Even if you do it “right,” complaints and bounces happen. Keep that blast radius isolated so it never touches critical emails. Use a different email service provider for that. \n\n\\-Warm up of email: especially if you self-host or use providers that allow custom IPs. Warm transactional slowly and never mix it with promos during warm-up.  \n\nSo, protect transactional at all costs, and assume cold will eventually get you in trouble.",

      "text": "Spent January through June testing every growth tactic from blogs and Twitter threads. Tracked every dollar and hour invested with actual ROI calculations. Out of 9 tactics, only 1 was profitable. The other 8 were negative ROI or break-even at best. Here's the honest breakdown nobody shares.\n\nWhat failed with actual numbers: Facebook ads spent $2,100 getting 12 customers at $175 CAC, LTV is $140 = negative $420 total. Referral program built for $400 and 20 hours, generated 3 referrals in 5 months = negative ROI. Growth loops took 30 hours to build, 8% of users engaged, zero viral growth = wasted time. Twitter posting daily for 4 months, grew 890 followers, converted 1 customer = negative ROI counting time. Partnership outreach sent 140 emails, closed 2 partnerships bringing 4 customers over 3 months = barely break-even.​\n\nWhat actually worked: SEO blog content. Invested $0 cash, 60 hours writing 18 posts over 6 months. Started ranking month 3, now brings 15-20 signups weekly growing monthly. Customer acquisition cost is $0, return is infinite. Currently at $4.1K MRR with 78% from organic search.\n\nThe growth hacking reality: most tactics sound good but have terrible economics for bootstrapped startups. They work at scale with budgets and teams, not at $0-5K MRR with solo founders. Everyone shares what they're trying, nobody shares what actually made money versus lost money.​\n\nPulled data from [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) comparing growth tactics across 180 bootstrapped SaaS to validate my experience. Pattern was clear: 73% of successful ones under $10K MRR relied primarily on SEO and organic community engagement. Only 12% made paid acquisition work profitably before $15K MRR. Tactics that require budget or scale don't work until you have budget and scale.\n\nThe controversial truth: stop growth hacking and just do boring SEO consistently for 6 months. One profitable channel beats nine break-even tactics. Most growth hackers are broke because they chase tactics instead of ROI.​\n\nWhat's your actual ROI on growth tactics? Be honest with real numbers.",

Tried all the \"sexy\" growth hacks first Product Hunt launch, cold outreach, paid communities. Got some initial traffic spikes but nothing stuck.\n\n\n\nThen we did something most growth hackers skip because it's not exciting. Directory submissions. Sounds outdated but here's what actually happened.\n\n\n\nWeek 1-2 was pure setup. Got our site submitted to 200+ active SaaS and startup directories. Not the spammy 2015 directories, modern ones that Google actually crawls regularly. Used [GetMoreBacklinks](http://getmorebacklinks.org) to automate the bulk work since manual submission would've killed an entire week.\n\n\n\nWeek 3-6 was the waiting game. Nothing dramatic happened immediately which is why most people give up. But our crawl frequency in Search Console started increasing. Google was discovering our pages faster because we had legit inbound signals.\n\n\n\nWeek 7-12 is when it clicked. Domain authority went from 0 to 28. Started ranking for 47 longtail keywords we weren't ranking for at all before. Organic traffic hit 800 visits per month and it's still climbing weekly.\n\n\n\nThe growth hack nobody wants to hear is that boring systematic work beats clever tactics. Directory submissions gave us the authority baseline that made everything else work faster. Our content now ranks in days instead of months because Google already trusts our domain.\n\n\n\nIf you're starting from zero authority, stop chasing viral moments. Build your foundation first.

I've definitely been there, trying the latest tactic only to see a tiny blip and then back to crickets.\n\n\n\nThat whole directory submission thing sounds almost too simple, but your results speak for themselves. It's wild how much of a difference those \"boring\" backlinks can make in terms of domain authority and how Google views your site. Makes complete sense though – if Google sees legit sites linking to you, it starts to trust you more, and then your content gets a much better shot at ranking.\n\n\n\nIt’s a good reminder that sometimes the most effective strategies are the ones that require patience and consistent effort, rather than a quick, clever trick.\n\n\n\nDid you notice any particular types of directories that seemed more effective than others, or was it really just the sheer volume of quality submissions that did the heavy lifting?

Really, it’s not a ranking system we’re finding to be useful, but rather source of influence. I think in the future we’ll care less about where our client’s sites rank, and more about being a site that these AI models trust enough to pull answers from.

You're essentially trying to measure a black box.\nWhat seems to matter more (based on what people are finding) is whether your brand shows up in the training data and gets cited in authoritative sources that LLMs pull from.

They’re optimized for crawling, not for extraction and synthesis.\n\nThis is why AEO is emerging alongside SEO. You’re optimizing for how machines understand and frame you, not just where you rank.\n\nIt feels uncomfortable because we’re used to dashboards and exact numbers. But early SEO felt the same way before Search Console existed. The teams learning how AI “sees” them now will have a massive edge when real analytics finally arrive.",

      "text": "So I went down a rabbit hole this week after hearing a marketer friend mention that **fishing enthusiasts convert incredibly well on insurance offers.**\n\nMy first thought: \"That makes zero sense.\"\n\nMy second thought: \"Wait... does it though?\"\n\nTurns out there's a mountain of documented cases where advertisers discovered their highest-converting audiences had absolutely nothing to do with their product category. And honestly, some of these findings are wild.\n\n\n\n**The George Foreman Grill was supposed to be for boxing fans.**\n\nMakes sense, right? Boxing legend endorses a grill, target male boxing enthusiasts. Except when they actually tested it, 60-70% of buyers were college-educated women. They completely retooled the infomercials to show family grilling scenes instead of boxing references. Result: 100+ million units sold.\n\nThe audience that \"should\" convert wasn't even close to the audience that actually did.\n\n\n\n**A bicycle company's best customers were music fans.**\n\nState Bicycle Company started targeting people who liked specific music genres on Facebook — zero connection to cycling whatsoever. $500K in incremental annual sales. Their cost-per-click was 1/5th of other platforms. Music taste predicted bicycle purchases better than interest in... bicycles.\n\n\n\n**Luxury travel converts better when you target Chanel fans, not travel enthusiasts.**\n\nLuxury Link discovered that targeting people interested in Chanel, Prada, and Fendi drove a 100% increase in travel package sales versus targeting people who liked travel pages. Cross-category luxury affinity was the signal, not the product category itself.\n\n\n\n**Chicago Cubs fans convert on everything apparently.**\n\nBonobos (men's pants) ran ads to Cubs fans that said \"Pants for Wrigley\" — 10% of entire site traffic. Arizona Office of Tourism targeted Cubs fans (spring training angle) — 27% conversion rate on visitor guide requests, 8x more clicks than paid search.\n\nSports team loyalty as an identity signal is weirdly powerful.\n\n\n\n**Here's the one that really got me:**\n\nA real estate company running Gmail campaigns for apartment rentals found that targeting \"luxury travelers\" and \"green-living enthusiasts\" delivered the lowest cost-per-lead — **better than targeting people actually looking for apartments.**\n\nPeople with certain lifestyle affinities who weren't actively searching converted better than high-intent searchers.\n\n\n\n**The pattern I keep seeing:**\n\n* Lifestyle identity > product interest\n* Life stage > purchase intent (people moving or getting married convert better on mattresses than people searching \"best mattress\")\n* Algorithms find audiences humans never would have picked (Google's auto-generated audiences hit 3x higher engagement than manually selected ones)\n* Gender assumptions invert constantly (products with male endorsers often convert better with women)\n\n\n\nI'm not saying throw out your customer personas entirely. But maybe the fishing → insurance thing isn't that weird after all.\n\nPeople are complex. A 45-year-old guy who fishes on weekends might also be a homeowner thinking about his family's financial security. The fishing interest is a signal about lifestyle, values, and life stage — not just \"this person likes fish.\"\n\nThe takeaway for me: test audiences that feel completely unrelated. The \"logical\" targeting might be leaving money on the table.\n\nAnyone else discovered weird audience overlaps that worked way better than expected? Would love to hear what's worked for you.\n\n",

Everyone’s chasing the same handful, which makes scaling campaigns a nightmare.\n\nMid-tier creators are often overlooked – Higgsfield works with \\~2,000 creators worldwide, but providing personalized support at that scale is nearly impossible. There’s a lot of talent out there, but finding the right fit is a huge challenge.\n\nFake metrics everywhere – bots, inflated views, and fake engagement are rampant. Even the old “views-to-comments” ratio doesn’t reliably indicate quality anymore. Alex calls it a social media trust crisis, and it’s easy to see why: you can’t fully verify the authenticity of most metrics on IG, TikTok, or Twitter.\n\nContext beats categories – Instead of filtering creators by broad tags like “Tech” or “SaaS,” Alex looks at what creators are actually talking about. He’s focused on intent and real engagement, not just vanity metrics.\n\nFor anyone managing influencer campaigns right now, this rings painfully true. Finding creators who actually drive conversions feels like a game of whack-a-mole—with bots, oversaturated top-tier talent, and noisy metrics everywhere.\n\nI’m curious—how is everyone else navigating this? How do you identify creators who genuinely resonate with your audience without wasting your budget chasing the obvious top-tier names?",

We’ve run into the same issue—top creators are either booked forever or insanely expensive, and the results don’t always justify it.  \nWhat’s worked a bit better for us is looking at *how* creators talk about tools, not how big they are. Small to mid creators who clearly use the product in their own workflow tend to convert way better than polished “AI educator” accounts.  \nMetrics are honestly a mess right now, so we rely more on content depth + comment quality than views.

For example, I’ve been using Lessie AI to crawl public social content and identify people—sometimes creators, sometimes regular users—who are genuinely talking about specific pain points or product areas. It helps uncover “hidden” talent that standard influencer databases often miss.\n\nIt’s slower upfront, but the results feel much more authentic and aligned with actual user intent.

We were bleeding budget like everyone else, right?\n\nThen something weird happened in November. Sales guy comes to our weekly and goes \"Yo, had three demos yesterday. All three said they found us through ChatGPT.\" We're like... what? Checked the previous week. Same thing. People literally typing questions like \"best PM tool for creative teams\" into ChatGPT and our name keeps popping up in the responses.\n\nWe weren't even trying. We just existed on the internet.\n\nSo obviously I went down the rabbit hole. Spent two weeks testing every AI engine I could find - ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini. Asked hundreds of variations of buyer-intent questions in our niche.\n\nThe companies getting recommended aren't always the ones dominating Google and it blew my mind. Sometimes they're on page 2 or 3. What matters is completely different signals - how you're referenced across the web, your structured data, even how other sites contextualize your brand.\n\nThis is what people are starting to call LLM visibility - when your brand's discoverability in AI-generated responses. And right now? It's the wild west. Most companies have NO idea they're even being recommended (or ignored) by these engines.\n\nThe growth hack part. We started deliberately optimizing for this channel. Not throwing money at ads. Just strategic content + technical tweaks to make our brand \"legible\" to AI systems.\n\nAnd in 60 days our ChatGPT referral traffic went from basically zero to our third-highest demo source. CAC: $23. Yeah, you read that right.\n\nThe best part? Your competitors probably aren't even tracking this yet. They're still dumping budget into the same saturated channels while this blue ocean is sitting wide open.\n\nHas anyone else stumbled into this, or am I just getting lucky with timing?",

Many were starting from zero. The bet was that authenticity + execution would beat “experience.” That part makes sense to me.What’s still hard is the step before any of this works.\n\n- How did he actually find these people in the first place?\n- Not creators as a category, but individuals who:\n\n  - might never have posted content\n  - don’t self-identify as “creators”\n  - could care deeply about the product\n  - have the taste and energy to grow into the role\n\n\nManually, this usually means digging through posts, comments, side projects, random mentions, and trying to infer intent from very weak signals. It’s slow, and it’s noisy.\n\nFor people here who’ve had a similar experience to Tobin’s growth hack, or who’ve tried to recruit creators from zero:\n\n- Where do you even look?\n\n- What early signals do you trust when there’s no content history?\n\n- How do you avoid relying purely on gut feeling?\n\n\nCurious how others approach this, especially when the goal is to build something long-term, not just run a one-off campaign.",

      "text": "Something I’ve been thinking about more after watching how people around me actually use AI now.\n\nNot for broad stuff like **“best android phone.”**  \nFor **specific questions**. Things like:\n\n* “Are there ride-on lawn mowers in a mid-range price?”\n* “Which standing desk brands will ship replacement parts?”\n* “Is there a version of this product that works without a subscription?”\n\nThese are **narrowing questions**, not discovery.  \nThe kind people used to answer by opening 10 tabs but now just ask AI directly.\n\nAnd in a lot of those cases, **the user never clicks anything**.  \nThey just get an answer.\n\nThat’s where my head starts hurting a bit, because almost all of our KPIs assume a click happens somewhere.\n\nCTR, impressions, sessions, bounce rate. All of that only exists if someone lands on your site.  \n  \n**With AI in the mix:**\n\n* You can be evaluated without being visited.\n* You can be compared without being clicked.\n* You can be excluded without ever knowing.\n\nIf an AI decides your pricing is unclear, your variants are confusing, or your policies aren’t explicit, **you just don’t show up**.\n\nThere’s no obvious drop in impressions.  \nNothing looks broken in GA.\n\nThere’s a **selection step happening before traffic exists at all**.\n\nSo if SERP matters less here, **what the hell am I supposed to be looking at instead?**\n\nHonestly, I don’t have a great answer yet.\n\nMost of what I’m doing right now feels like rough spot checks and none of it scales well:\n\n* Asking very specific buyer-style questions and seeing if the store shows up at all\n* Checking whether pricing, shipping, or returns get stated clearly or come back as “unclear”\n* Noticing whether the product is framed as a real option or just mentioned as an alternative\n\nIt’s easy to read too much into a handful of examples, so I don’t love any of this as a metric.\n\nThe only thing that’s felt even mildly concrete is looking at **server logs**.\n\nNot as a performance KPI, more as a sanity check.  \nThings like a weekly or monthly look at:\n\n* Are AI-related crawlers hitting the site at all?\n* Which URLs are they actually requesting?\n* Do they reach product and category pages, or mostly bounce off JS-heavy routes?\n\nIt doesn’t tell you what the model understood.  \nBut if those crawls dry up, or never touch the pages that matter, that could be an early sign before it shows up in traffic or revenue.\n\nIn one case we noticed AI crawlers hitting blog pages regularly but never touching product pages.\n\nRight now this feels like the only experiment I can run before traffic actually moves.\n\nObviously traffic will always be important, humans still buy things.\n\nBut it seems like there’s now a **layer above SEO** that is separate from being clicked.\n\n**How are others handling this?**\n\n* Are you guys introducing new KPIs for this?\n* What else can I do to make sure this doesn't become the reason traffic drops in 3 months?\n\nPosting mostly because it feels like we’re still measuring the wrong part of the funnel and acting like nothing changed.",

AI, if prompted correctly, doesn't care about your feelings.\n\nCurious about how you structured your personas: did you feed them specific 'pain points' and 'friction thresholds' to make them drop off, or did you give them a goal and let them find the friction themselves?\n\nI feel like the next stage of growth hacking is definitely going to be about these pre-code simulations to protect the brand's 'trust equity'.",
