I started treating documentation as part of the experiment loop. I’ve been keeping hypotheses, results, and decisions in one place using **Notion**, and I also have access to a **free 3-month startup trial that includes Notion AI**, which I mainly use to summarize experiment outcomes and clean up thinking between iterations.\n\nThis didn’t magically create growth.  \nBut it stopped us from wasting cycles.\n\nIf you’ve run experiments that didn’t move the needle, what do you think actually broke?  \nI’d like to hear how others make learnings compound.",

      "text": "January through June: tried viral loops, referral programs, gamification, growth Twitter threads, partnership outreach, influencer collaborations, every tactic from growth blogs. Revenue fluctuated between $400-700 monthly. Constant effort, zero compound effect. Each tactic worked briefly then died.\n\nJuly: gave up on growth hacks, went all-in on the most boring channel possible SEO blog content. Published 3 posts weekly targeting specific long-tail keywords. Nothing clever, just solving actual problems people search for. First 6 weeks got maybe 200 total visitors. Almost quit because growth hacks felt more exciting.​\n\nEight months later: SEO brings 15-20 signups daily on autopilot, zero ongoing effort. Revenue at $3,600 monthly, up 800% from growth hacking phase. All from boring consistent content compounding. Best part: can stop writing new posts and traffic keeps growing. Growth hacks required constant effort, SEO compounds.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth: growth hacks feel productive but rarely compound. SEO feels boring but creates sustainable growth. Viral loops need existing users. Referrals need happy customers you don't have yet. Partnerships take months negotiating. SEO just requires showing up consistently for 3-6 months while seeing zero results.​\n\nMost growth hackers fail because they lack patience for compound channels. They want this week's tactic to work this week. Real growth comes from boring consistency over months. Found this studying [FounderToolkit's](http://foundertoolkit.org) growth data successful founders dominated 1-2 boring channels, failed founders tried everything weekly.\n\nWhat's your compound channel?

Same keyword cluster, same pain points, same call to action.

The first few months look like failure. Then suddenly past work starts doing the heavy lifting.\n\nI also agree that most people fail here because they mix channels too early.

Dedicated domain, SPF, DKIM, DMARC aligned, low complaint rate, zero list risk. Look into SMTP services like Mailtrap, Mailgun, SMT2Go, etc. \n\n\\-Cold outreach is inherently risky. Even if you do it “right,” complaints and bounces happen. Keep that blast radius isolated so it never touches critical emails. Use a different email service provider for that. \n\n\\-Warm up of email: especially if you self-host or use providers that allow custom IPs. Warm transactional slowly and never mix it with promos during warm-up.  \n\nSo, protect transactional at all costs, and assume cold will eventually get you in trouble.",

It was who I was sending it to.\n\nOnce I started filtering leads by actual role and buying relevance, reply quality improved almost immediately. Same copy, same volume, better conversations.\n\nTo support this, I started using SalesTarget  because it lets me narrow leads by real job roles instead of guessing from company size or industry alone. I still test copy and timing, but targeting turned out to be the biggest lever for us.\n\nFor people using outbound as a growth channel, I am curious.\n\nWhat experiments have actually worked for you lately?

      "text": "Spent January through June testing every growth tactic from blogs and Twitter threads. Tracked every dollar and hour invested with actual ROI calculations. Out of 9 tactics, only 1 was profitable. The other 8 were negative ROI or break-even at best. Here's the honest breakdown nobody shares.\n\nWhat failed with actual numbers: Facebook ads spent $2,100 getting 12 customers at $175 CAC, LTV is $140 = negative $420 total. Referral program built for $400 and 20 hours, generated 3 referrals in 5 months = negative ROI. Growth loops took 30 hours to build, 8% of users engaged, zero viral growth = wasted time. Twitter posting daily for 4 months, grew 890 followers, converted 1 customer = negative ROI counting time. Partnership outreach sent 140 emails, closed 2 partnerships bringing 4 customers over 3 months = barely break-even.​\n\nWhat actually worked: SEO blog content. Invested $0 cash, 60 hours writing 18 posts over 6 months. Started ranking month 3, now brings 15-20 signups weekly growing monthly. Customer acquisition cost is $0, return is infinite. Currently at $4.1K MRR with 78% from organic search.\n\nThe growth hacking reality: most tactics sound good but have terrible economics for bootstrapped startups. They work at scale with budgets and teams, not at $0-5K MRR with solo founders. Everyone shares what they're trying, nobody shares what actually made money versus lost money.​\n\nPulled data from [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) comparing growth tactics across 180 bootstrapped SaaS to validate my experience. Pattern was clear: 73% of successful ones under $10K MRR relied primarily on SEO and organic community engagement. Only 12% made paid acquisition work profitably before $15K MRR. Tactics that require budget or scale don't work until you have budget and scale.\n\nThe controversial truth: stop growth hacking and just do boring SEO consistently for 6 months. One profitable channel beats nine break-even tactics. Most growth hackers are broke because they chase tactics instead of ROI.​\n\nWhat's your actual ROI on growth tactics? Be honest with real numbers.",

Tried all the \"sexy\" growth hacks first Product Hunt launch, cold outreach, paid communities. Got some initial traffic spikes but nothing stuck.\n\n\n\nThen we did something most growth hackers skip because it's not exciting. Directory submissions. Sounds outdated but here's what actually happened.\n\n\n\nWeek 1-2 was pure setup. Got our site submitted to 200+ active SaaS and startup directories. Not the spammy 2015 directories, modern ones that Google actually crawls regularly. Used [GetMoreBacklinks](http://getmorebacklinks.org) to automate the bulk work since manual submission would've killed an entire week.\n\n\n\nWeek 3-6 was the waiting game. Nothing dramatic happened immediately which is why most people give up. But our crawl frequency in Search Console started increasing. Google was discovering our pages faster because we had legit inbound signals.\n\n\n\nWeek 7-12 is when it clicked. Domain authority went from 0 to 28. Started ranking for 47 longtail keywords we weren't ranking for at all before. Organic traffic hit 800 visits per month and it's still climbing weekly.\n\n\n\nThe growth hack nobody wants to hear is that boring systematic work beats clever tactics. Directory submissions gave us the authority baseline that made everything else work faster. Our content now ranks in days instead of months because Google already trusts our domain.\n\n\n\nIf you're starting from zero authority, stop chasing viral moments. Build your foundation first. The compound effect is real but you need something to compound from.",

It's wild how much of a difference those \"boring\" backlinks can make in terms of domain authority and how Google views your site. Makes complete sense though – if Google sees legit sites linking to you, it starts to trust you more, and then your content gets a much better shot at ranking.\n\n\n\nIt’s a good reminder that sometimes the most effective strategies are the ones that require patience and consistent effort, rather than a quick, clever trick.\n\n\n\nDid you notice any particular types of directories that seemed more effective than others, or was it really just the sheer volume of quality submissions that did the heavy lifting?

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI wanted to share a comprehensive price comparison of LinkedIn automation tools to help everyone make informed decisions. As a Botdog founder, we obviously research the market constantly to see how our tool stacks up and ensure we're delivering the best value. My goal is to give you an honest rundown of what's on the market, but this analysis will naturally have some bias.\n\n**TLDR: Prices range from $8.25 to $1,499/month. Linked Helper remains cheapest at $8.25/mo (with caveats), we believe Botdog offers the best value at $35/mo annually (especially for founders, individual reps, and small teams), HeyReach is arguably the best and most cost-effective option for agencies needing 30+ accounts, and CoPilot AI is still the most expensive at $203+/mo.**\n\n# Average cost of LinkedIn automation in 2026\n\nMost reliable tools now charge between $55-$165/month per user. The market has matured with clearer tier separation: budget tools ($8.25-$50/mo), mid-tier ($50-$100/mo), high ($100-$200/mo) and enterprise ($200-$1,499/mo).\n\n# Quick price rundown (annual pricing)\n\n**Budget ($8.25-$50/mo):**\n\n* **Botdog:** $35-$49/mo - Cloud-based, unlimited campaigns, best value, $49/month includes AI\n* **Linked Helper:** $8.25-$24.75/mo - Desktop-based (your computer must stay on for campaigns to run)\n* **Waalaxy Pro:** $21-$43/mo - Limited to 300 connection requests, $21/month without inbox feature\n* **Meet Alfred:** $29-$49/mo - Limited to 3 campaigns on cheaper tiers, only 3.4/5 G2 rating\n\n**Mid ($50-$100/mo):**\n\n* **Phantombuster Starter:** $56/mo - 20-hour execution limit (most need Pro at $128)\n* **HeyReach:** $59/mo - Agency-focused, overkill for solo users\n* **Dripify Pro:** $59/mo - LinkedIn + Email, unlimited campaigns\n* **Waalaxy Advanced:** $66/mo - Unlimited LinkedIn requests finally\n* **La Growth Machine Basic:** $60/mo - Only 3 campaigns, templates only\n* **Expandi Business:** $79/mo - add $118/mo for visual features = $197 total\n* **Lemlist Multichannel Expert:** $79/mo - LinkedIn + Email, 400 enrichment credits\n\n**High ($100-$200/mo):**\n\n* **La Growth Machine Pro:** $110/mo - Limited to 6 campaigns\n* **Phantombuster Pro:** $128/mo - 80-hour execution limit\n* **La Growth Machine Ultimate:** $165/mo - Unlimited campaigns finally\n* **HeyReach Agency (50 accounts):** $749/mo total ($15/account)\n\n**Enterprise ($200-$500/mo):**\n\n* **CoPilot AI:** $203-$294/mo - AI-powered, most expensive option, limited to 10 campaigns\n* **Phantombuster Team:** $352/mo - 300-hour execution limit\n* **HeyReach Unlimited:** $1,499/mo - Unlimited accounts (perfect for agencies)\n\n# My take…\n\nIf you need **LinkedIn-only automation** and want the best value: **Botdog at $35/mo** gives you unlimited campaigns, 3-minute setup, and 4.9/5 reliability at a price that won’t break the bank (but obviously I’m biased 😉).\n\n* If you need **multi-channel (LinkedIn + Email)** and want simplicity: Dripify at $59/mo or Lemlist at $79/mo (if you're email-focused) provide solid value without La Growth Machine's complexity.\n* If you're an **agency managing 50+ accounts**: HeyReach is purpose-built for your use case.\n* If you're **extremely budget-conscious** and can tolerate bugs: Meet Alfred at $49/mo is the cheapest multi-channel option, though reliability might suffer.\n* If you’re happy to **keep your computer running 24/7**: Linked Helper at $8.25-$24.75/mo might make sense.\n\nScreenshots below 👇\n\n[Botdog - $35\\/mo annually with unlimited campaigns and 3-minute setup.

Your computer has to stay on constantly, it slows everything down, and the interface feels ancient. Easy to misconfigure and accidentally spam yourself into a ban. Phantombuster is cool for scraping but gets expensive fast once you stack workflows, and you're constantly debugging why something broke. Neither feels like something I'd trust long-term on a main account.HeyReach I've seen used in a couple agency setups and that's really where it shines. Managing like 10+ accounts from one dashboard without losing your mind is the main selling point. It's also way more conservative by default, which sounds boring but probably keeps people out of trouble. You can't just crank the dials to max and hope for the best like you can with Waalaxy or Dripify.Feature-wise, the stuff that's actually useful isn't the AI gimmicks or fancy personalization tokens. It's the boring safety stuff. Clear daily limits, auto-slowdowns when engagement tanks, account health warnings. One thing I wish more tools had is smarter adaptive throttling that reacts to how LinkedIn's behaving in real time, not just static caps. That's what actually keeps accounts alive.",

Actually,\n\n* Make a new folder, maybe called \"Claude Workspace\"\n* Copy files into it (do not move them)\n* Think about it as a playground where mistakes are okay\n\nPeople usually forget to make backups. But if asked to intentionally copy files to a new folder, easy-peacy! People will do it\n\n# Method 2: Be Very Specific\n\n**Being polite with AI can be dangerous.**\n\n❌ Bad: \"Could you organize these files?\"\n\n✅ Good: \"Sort these 47 PDFs by date. DO NOT delete anything. Make folders named by year.\"\n\nWhen you are more specific, Claude Cowork does not need to guess, and **guessing is where problems happen.**\n\n# Method 3: Check Before You Approve\n\nWhen Claude Cowork wants to delete/move/rename something:\n\n* Wait 2 seconds\n* Ask: \"Do I understand WHY Claude wants to do this?\"\n* No? Refuse and do it yourself\n\nBe cautious on what Claude Cowork is about to do before you choose\n\n# A Simple Smart-Intern Mindset \n\nClaude Cowork is fast & useful for people. But like driving a fast car, you want to drive it carefully. \n\nGood news is all these protections are basically just asking you to think a bit differently:\n\n**Think of Claude Cowork as a smart intern who understands words literally, and has the key to your office.**\n\n**You would not tell an intern \"figure out my files by yourself.\" Same thing here.**",

Ads brought us people who didn't care. Outbound brought us people already talking about the problem we solve - way easier conversations, way higher close rates.\n\nNot saying ads never work, but for us at this stage they were just burning cash on the wrong audience.

Everyone’s chasing the same handful, which makes scaling campaigns a nightmare.\n\nMid-tier creators are often overlooked – Higgsfield works with \\~2,000 creators worldwide, but providing personalized support at that scale is nearly impossible. There’s a lot of talent out there, but finding the right fit is a huge challenge.\n\nFake metrics everywhere – bots, inflated views, and fake engagement are rampant. Even the old “views-to-comments” ratio doesn’t reliably indicate quality anymore. Alex calls it a social media trust crisis, and it’s easy to see why: you can’t fully verify the authenticity of most metrics on IG, TikTok, or Twitter.\n\nContext beats categories – Instead of filtering creators by broad tags like “Tech” or “SaaS,” Alex looks at what creators are actually talking about. He’s focused on intent and real engagement, not just vanity metrics.\n\nFor anyone managing influencer campaigns right now, this rings painfully true. Finding creators who actually drive conversions feels like a game of whack-a-mole—with bots, oversaturated top-tier talent, and noisy metrics everywhere.\n\nI’m curious—how is everyone else navigating this? How do you identify creators who genuinely resonate with your audience without wasting your budget chasing the obvious top-tier names?",

Pushback is a good sign the audience isn’t botted to hell.\n\nThen I run small, structured tests: same brief, same CTA, 10–20 creators, capped spend, and judge them on cost per qualified lead, not views. Rinse and double down only on the top 10–20%.\n\nI’ve rotated through Aspire and Modash for discovery, experimented with Grin for workflows, and lately Pulse for Reddit to find high-intent Reddit creators and threads where people are already asking “what should I buy” instead of just doom-scrolling.\n\nMain point: design a test rig around your funnel, then let data, not fame, tell you who actually sells.",

The other ones got +20k views each, but they weren’t reels that were meant ti be viral. They were made to increase the follow rate of the people who were coming from the 700k views one. (only posted 10 reels on this account)\n\nNow the thing is this. I realised that what I’ve learned  can be applied to get views in any niche and I also realised what I truly like: analysing why and how things work + teaching others how to do so. \n\nI already got some people that know me irl asking for my advice and since I don’t want to launch a course, my question is this:\n\nWhat would you offer to people that want your guidance? \n\n•consultancy: pretty much helping them and guiding them step by step (would have to charge more)\n\n•social media analysis + fixes and perhaps some sort of planning for their content?
