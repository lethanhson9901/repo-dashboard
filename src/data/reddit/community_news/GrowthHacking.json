      "text": "I wanted to share our story, because the last year has been one of the hardest of my life.\n\n  \nBack in 2023, things were looking great. We'd raised a $7M Series A for our IoT business. I’m the non-technical founder (my background is in finance and comms), and my co-founder is the tech lead. We had a solid product, real revenue, and happy customers. I thought we were on the right track.\n\n  \nThen, in late 2024, the market just... changed.\n\n  \nEvery investor meeting suddenly became an interrogation about our AI strategy. We didn't have one. We were an infrastructure company, and overnight, that wasn't interesting anymore. The excitement for what we were building just vanished.\n\n  \nWe looked at our burn rate and the bank account: 8 months of cash left.  \nThe toughest part of being the non-technical founder in a situation like this is the specific kind of helplessness you feel. I can't jump into the code. I can't help build our way out of the problem. My job is to find the answers and steer the ship, but I was watching the clock tick down, feeling like I was failing my team.\n\n  \nTo make it worse, we couldn't just shut down the old business. We have long-term contracts with enterprise clients, and walking away would mean getting sued into oblivion. So we had to do this crazy balancing act: keep the old lights on to pay the bills, while pivoting the entire team to build a new AI hardware product for devs.\n\n  \nI honestly thought we wouldn't make it.\n\n  \nWe didn't raise a single dollar in 2025. VCs wouldn't touch us. We had to cut costs brutally. I had to tell the team: look, we have until August, if this new thing doesn't work, we're done.\n\n  \nSomehow, we’re still here. It’s Jan 2026 and we're about to launch the new product. I’m currently trying to figure out how to spin this off into a new entity so our original investors don't get screwed, which is a whole other nightmare.\n\n  \nJust wanted to share this for anyone else who feels like they're drowning in this AI shift. Pivoting a 40-person company with no new money is the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\n  \nIf anyone has experience spinning off a new product while keeping legacy investors happy, I’d love to hear how you handled the equity split.\n\n",

You should also be looking to leverage these relationships to increase your recurring revenue through upsells and new pipeline.\n\nAI-assisted development can also help the velocity and productivity of your team massively.  I’m not saying to rely solely on AI to develop your products, but it sounds like you still need to make cuts to remain viable in addition to your new product launch.",

          "text": "Damn, this is one of the clearest “AI whiplash” stories I’ve seen. Appreciate you sharing it.\n\nA few things you actually did right (that most founders in your position don’t):\n\nYou didn’t nuke the legacy business even though investors stopped caring. You kept the contracts and cashflow instead of “burn the boats” LARPing.\nYou were honest with the team about the August deadline instead of pretending everything was fine.\nYou didn’t chase some vague “AI strategy deck” – you picked a specific new product (AI hardware for devs) and moved the org, which is insanely hard with ~40 people.\nStill, there are some brutal lessons in here for the rest of us:\n\nTheme risk is real. You built a legit infra company, real revenue, happy customers – and the narrative still killed your ability to raise. Anyone building now needs to assume the market mood can flip again in 12–18 months.\n\nBurn is the gun to your head. 40 people + 8 months of runway is a ticking time bomb. The real constraint wasn’t “no AI story”; it was lack of optionality. With a 10-person team and the same revenue, this is a very different story.\n\nNon-technical founders need a “crisis plan”. You described that helplessness perfectly. In calm times it’s fine; in a pivot, it’s a tax. The counter-move is:\n\nKeep the team as small and senior as possible.\nBuild direct customer access + distribution as your superpower so you’re not “just” steering.\nOn the spin-out / equity split question (the nightmare you’re in now):\n\nNot legal advice, but patterns I’ve seen that don’t blow everything up:\n\nSpin-out NewCo, but don’t pretend OldCo never existed.\nLegacy investors usually get some carry into NewCo (e.g. a small % of common or a “shadow” class) in exchange for:\n\nLetting the team move over.\nNot blocking IP transfer / license.\nAgreeing not to sue when you basically starve OldCo.\nTie economics to who’s actually doing the work now.\nFounders & team building the new product should own the bulk of NewCo. Legacy investors participate, but they don’t get to double-dip at the same price as before. Typical levers:\n\nNew option pool heavily weighted to the current/lean team.\nLegacy investors get a discounted SAFE or a fixed % that reflects risk they already took, not “we own 60% again.”\nClean story for future investors.\nNew investors will ask: “Who controls what, and what obligations does NewCo have to OldCo?”\nRed flags that kill deals:\n\nIP is ambiguous (OldCo maybe owns everything).\nLegacy investors have veto rights / weird ratchets.\nCap table is so crowded that there’s no room for new equity.\nPractically, if I were in your shoes and had to keep everyone (team + legacy investors) minimally sane:\n\nGet a brutally honest board-level meeting.\nPut three options on the table in writing:\n\nA) Run OldCo to cashflow + modest growth, no spin-out.\nB) Spin-out NewCo with clear cap table, legacy investors get X% and first check rights.\nC) Wind down in an orderly way.\nForce everyone to confront reality instead of hand-waving “we’ll see after launch.”\nDesign NewCo like you learned from this.\n\nMinimal team.\nRuthless burn controls.\nDon’t build “AI infra for infra’s sake” – pick a wedge devs would actually miss.\nProtect your own time and sanity.\nYou’re effectively running:\n\nA distressed infra business,\nA seed-stage deep-tech startup,\nAnd a legal/structuring mess. That’s three full-time jobs. Decide what only you can do (likely: narrative, key customers, and the spin-out deal) and delegate or kill everything else.\nIf you’re willing to share anonymously: I’d be very curious what you wish you’d done differently in 2023 when things looked great. My guess: slower hiring, tighter burn, and a product wedge closer to the AI/dev stack earlier.\n\nEither way, respect for fighting through this. Most companies just quietly die and pretend it was “a soft landing.” You actually tried to steer the ship while the market moved the ocean underneath you.",

It’s a trap. It burns time, money, and emotional energy without getting you any closer to product–market fit. And as a technical founder, I’ve been there.\n\nInvestors asking about AI may not actually be about AI.  It can be their way of testing your understanding of where your market is headed, your ability to articulate long-term strategy, and your sense of future moat. It’s a question about vision, not features. A vision test, not a buzzword test.\n\nIf you’re still figuring out who you’re serving and why they’d pay, building won’t magically solve that. Strategy, customer discovery, and positioning are the uncomfortable parts — and they’re the things that determine whether anything you build actually matters.\n\nTBH, the risk here isn’t that the product is obsolete — it’s that you, the founder, might be reacting to investor pressure by building instead of thinking. And that’s the wrong direction to double down on.\n\nFrom your post, it’s not even clear that your product is “obsolete.”  It actually sounds like you’ve had some traction with customers, and some traction with fundraising - which means the foundation is there. What you’re feeling now is the pressure of needing to steer, not code.\n\nDon’t get lost in the noise. Don’t follow the sirens.

Decided to build a second product within the same company, which was also an initial success (Enterprise B2B SaaS). We had to raise more money for sales and marketing, but the complexity of having 2 products with different target groups in a relatively early stage company (60 people) spooked all future investors. \nMy advice is: don't do it. Close the first business by giving money back to investors or just resign and let someone else lead that one. Start the second business with a small trusted team, clean cap table and new investors. Old investors won't trust you anymore and your goal should be to avoid any litigation (which will wear you down). \nHappy to talk and share my advice!",

Revenue fluctuated between $400-700 monthly. Constant effort, zero compound effect. Each tactic worked briefly then died.\n\nJuly: gave up on growth hacks, went all-in on the most boring channel possible SEO blog content. Published 3 posts weekly targeting specific long-tail keywords. Nothing clever, just solving actual problems people search for. First 6 weeks got maybe 200 total visitors. Almost quit because growth hacks felt more exciting.​\n\nEight months later: SEO brings 15-20 signups daily on autopilot, zero ongoing effort. Revenue at $3,600 monthly, up 800% from growth hacking phase. All from boring consistent content compounding. Best part: can stop writing new posts and traffic keeps growing. Growth hacks required constant effort, SEO compounds.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth: growth hacks feel productive but rarely compound. SEO feels boring but creates sustainable growth. Viral loops need existing users. Referrals need happy customers you don't have yet. Partnerships take months negotiating. SEO just requires showing up consistently for 3-6 months while seeing zero results.​\n\nMost growth hackers fail because they lack patience for compound channels. They want this week's tactic to work this week. Real growth comes from boring consistency over months. Found this studying [FounderToolkit's](http://foundertoolkit.org) growth data successful founders dominated 1-2 boring channels, failed founders tried everything weekly.\n\nWhat's your compound channel?

SEO isn’t just “write content”. It’s aligning with how search engines interpret intent over time.\n\nWhat surprised me most was how boring consistency feels while it’s working. The first few months look like failure. Then suddenly past work starts doing the heavy lifting.\n\nI also agree that most people fail here because they mix channels too early. One compound engine, fully understood, beats five half-tested hacks.\n\nCurious. When you doubled down on SEO, did you focus more on informational queries first or jump straight into commercial intent?",

      "text": "A lot of growth tactics chase volume: more content, more links, more hacks. The biggest organic win for my project came from going in the opposite direction ruthless relevance.​\n\nInstead of pumping out 30 shallow posts a month, I chose a handful of high-intent topics and built deep, semantically rich pages around them. Think \"best standing desk for small apartments\" instead of just \"standing desk,\" with every relevant angle covered: height range, weight capacity, space constraints, price brackets, real photos, and FAQs.​\n\nEach page was designed to rank for an entire cluster of queries, not a single keyword. That meant long-tail, mid-tail, and even some broader terms started to fall into place over time.\n\nI paired this with a simple authority foundation rather than aggressive link schemes. Started with a [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) getting the site listed on 200+ relevant business and niche directories. Over 60 days this added 42 indexed backlinks moving DA from 0 to 14. That baseline authority meant my comprehensive content pages could actually compete instead of sitting invisible even when they were better than what was ranking.​\n\nThen I watched Search Console like a growth dashboard: which queries was I almost ranking for, which posts were starting to pop, and where adding 20% more depth could move me onto page 1. Added a few curated mentions and \"best of\" list placements for high-quality editorial links once content proved its value.​\n\nThe result: fewer URLs, but each one pulling in traffic from dozens of relevant searches and converting better because the content was truly aligned with what users wanted.\n\nIf you're tired of \"publish more\" advice, try this: pick 5-10 high-intent topics, make those pages embarrass your competitors' content, build baseline authority through systematic citation building, and measure growth at the cluster level not just per keyword. It's a very different way to think about SEO as a growth channel.​",

Pick one surface where your users already hang out, ship one tight use case, and manually watch how the first 50 to 100 people use it. The patterns there usually tell you what content or loop is worth scaling.\n\nFounder content works when it documents learning, not when it tries to perform growth. Short clips or posts showing real prompts, outputs, or mistakes tend to land better than polished launches. X is hard unless you already have a signal, so I would not force it yet.\n\nIf you want virality later, it usually comes from a built-in sharing reason tied to output, not from posting more.

Needed a complete system covering validation through growth, not just coding tutorials.\n\nWhat finally worked was following a structured loop instead of random hustle: start with validated idea from actual customer conversations, use framework for picking good microSaaS problems, ship fast using boilerplate so I'm not rebuilding auth for the tenth time, launch across 20+ directories systematically not just Product Hunt, start SEO content immediately for compound growth. Repeatable process, not hoping each attempt magically works.\n\nResults following the system: went from $600 MRR stuck for months to $2.4K in 3 months by focusing on distribution instead of features, now at $5.1K after 7 months. Added maybe 2 small features total, spent 80% of time on content and launches instead of coding. Revenue grew from distribution, not from better product. The product was already good enough, just invisible.\n\nFound this systematic approach studying successful indie hackers in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) who documented their exact playbooks from idea to $10K MRR. They all had systems covering validation, fast shipping with boilerplates, systematic launches, and SEO as repeating loops. Failed founders (past me included) just built better products hoping customers appeared magically.\n\nFor those stuck at $0-1K MRR: what actually moved you to stable revenue, or what's blocking you if still stuck? Features, distribution, something else?",

Actually,\n\n* Make a new folder, maybe called \"Claude Workspace\"\n* Copy files into it (do not move them)\n* Think about it as a playground where mistakes are okay\n\nPeople usually forget to make backups. But if asked to intentionally copy files to a new folder, easy-peacy! People will do it\n\n# Method 2: Be Very Specific\n\n**Being polite with AI can be dangerous.**\n\n❌ Bad: \"Could you organize these files?\"\n\n✅ Good: \"Sort these 47 PDFs by date. DO NOT delete anything. Make folders named by year.\"\n\nWhen you are more specific, Claude Cowork does not need to guess, and **guessing is where problems happen.**\n\n# Method 3: Check Before You Approve\n\nWhen Claude Cowork wants to delete/move/rename something:\n\n* Wait 2 seconds\n* Ask: \"Do I understand WHY Claude wants to do this?\"\n* No? Refuse and do it yourself\n\nBe cautious on what Claude Cowork is about to do before you choose\n\n# A Simple Smart-Intern Mindset \n\nClaude Cowork is fast & useful for people. But like driving a fast car, you want to drive it carefully. \n\nGood news is all these protections are basically just asking you to think a bit differently:\n\n**Think of Claude Cowork as a smart intern who understands words literally, and has the key to your office.**\n\n**You would not tell an intern \"figure out my files by yourself.\" Same thing here.**",

      "text": "Hey folks 👋\n\nWe’ve been working on a password manager that takes a very different approach, and we’re genuinely curious what this community thinks.\n\nInstead of a text-based master password, users authenticate with a photo they choose, combined with a visual layer. The idea is simple: recognition is easier than recall. You don’t memorize strings, you recognize something personal.\n\nThe second controversial part: passwords are never stored.\nNot encrypted. Not hashed. Not in a vault.\n\nPasswords are regenerated on demand using cryptographic primitives, on-device checks and end-to-end encryption. If there’s a breach, there’s literally no password database to dump.\n\nThis raises a real question: If you were designing password security from scratch today, would you still use a master password at all?\n\nLooking forward to hearing honest takes… supportive or critical. 🙏🏻",

The moment a system requires a long explanation to prove it is safe, trust gets harder, not easier.\n\nThe photo based auth is interesting, but I would worry less about recall vs recognition and more about threat models. What happens with device compromise, screen recording, backups, or social engineering around that image choice. Regenerating passwords instead of storing them can work, but only if the regeneration inputs are truly isolated and auditable.\n\nI am not attached to master passwords as a concept, but I am very attached to clarity. If users and reviewers cannot easily answer what an attacker gets at each failure point, adoption is going to be rough no matter how elegant the crypto is.",

          "text": "There are basically two ways to find micro-influencers. If you have a $0 budget for tools and plenty of time, you can do it manually. Keyword search, scrolling, checking profiles. It works, but it’s slow and messy. You don’t see any performance data, so you end up DM/email’ing everyone, asking for stats, dumping everything into a spreadsheet, and only then figuring out who’s actually a fit.\n\nThat’s why brands that run micro-influencer campaigns at scale usually switch to special platforms. There are two types of tools - influencer marketplaces and influencer marketing platforms.\n\nA marketplace is a platform where creators register themselves. As a brand, you either post a collaboration brief and wait for creators to apply, or you reach out to creators already on that platform. It’s fast and easy to start, but the trade-off is that many of these creators built their content around ads and paid collabs. That doesn’t make them bad, but there’s usually more competition for audience attention because their followers are used to seeing sponsored posts all the time.\n\nAn influencer marketing platform works differently. It doesn’t rely only on creators who signed up. Instead, it’s built on a large discovery database where you search creators directly using filters. Big platforms have hundreds of millions of accounts in their databases. \n\nI work at HypeAuditor, so I can explain how this looks in practice. We have a database of 207M+ creators, mostly nano and micro. You can search by location, audience demographics, performance metrics (e.g., engagement), and keywords in bios and content to find highly niche creators that would be almost impossible to discover manually.\n\nIf you’re doing a couple of one-off collabs, marketplaces can be fine. If you’re running campaigns with lots of micro-influencers, discovery-based platforms usually make way more sense.",

Currently at $30K MRR with 340 paying customers.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Total ad spend: $0\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Channel 1: Building in Public (40% of customers)\\*\\*\n\n\n\nThis was the game changer. I started sharing everything on Twitter/X:\n\n\\- Weekly revenue updates\n\n\\- Feature launches\n\n\\- Failed experiments\n\n\\- Actual screenshots of our dashboard\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Why it works:\\*\\* People trust transparency. When you share your failures alongside wins, you become relatable, not salesy.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Tactics:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Posted 4-5x per week minimum\n\n\\- Replied to every comment\n\n\\- Engaged with others in the space (not competitors, adjacent tools)\n\n\\- Used Crescitaly to track which content drove actual signups\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Channel 2: Strategic Reddit & Community Engagement (35% of customers)\\*\\*\n\n\n\nNOT spamming links. Actually providing value.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The approach:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Found 5-6 subreddits where our ICP hangs out\n\n\\- Spent 2 weeks just answering questions, no mentions of our product\n\n\\- Built genuine karma and reputation\n\n\\- Mentioned our product ONLY when directly relevant to someone's problem\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Key insight:\\*\\* Reddit users have incredible BS detectors. If you're here to sell, they'll know. If you're here to help, they'll convert themselves.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Channel 3: Integration Partnerships (15% of customers)\\*\\*\n\n\n\nBuilt integrations with 3 popular tools in our space. Got listed in their marketplaces/directories.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Why it works:\\*\\* You're borrowing their distribution. Their users are already looking for solutions.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Channel 4: Cold DMs That Don't Suck (10% of customers)\\*\\*\n\n\n\nNot pitching. Starting conversations.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Template that worked:\\*\\*\n\n\"Hey \\[name\\], saw your post about \\[specific thing\\]. Had a similar experience with \\[relate\\]. Curious how you ended up solving \\[their problem\\]?\"\n\n\n\nThat's it. No pitch. Just genuine curiosity. The conversation naturally leads to what you do.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What I'd add if starting over:\\*\\*\n\n\\- YouTube content (long-form is underrated for B2B)\n\n\\- Newsletter from day 1\n\n\\- More IRL networking\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What didn't work:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Cold email (2% reply rate, waste of time)\n\n\\- Product Hunt (got 30 upvotes, 2 customers)\n\n\\- LinkedIn posts (maybe our ICP isn't there)\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Questions for the community:\\*\\*\n\n1. Anyone had success with YouTube for B2B SaaS?\n\n2. How do you measure organic attribution accurately?\n\n3. What's your best $0 CAC channel?",

One hero topic per ICP pain, then slice that into shorts for X and community posts. Don’t chase volume, chase 10–20 videos that become evergreen answers you can link in DMs and Reddit comments.\nOn attribution, I treat it like triangles not straight lines: last touch (what they clicked), first touch (where they first heard), and “self-reported” (“how did you hear about us?” free text in signup + a required field in onboarding). I log Reddit/X/organic in a simple sheet, then compare with GA/Search Console. I’ve used F5bot and Hypefury, tried GummySearch too, but Pulse for Reddit ended up as the thing I keep open because it surfaces the exact threads where my ICP is talking and drafts a first-pass reply I can humanize fast.\nNet: keep doing exactly this, but convert your best plays into reusable proof and content so every new customer pulls in the next one.",

I know this audience exists, I just struggle with finding their actual email addresses in a clean, legit way.\n\nSo I wanted to ask people who’ve been around longer than me:\n\n* Where do you usually get email lists for *specific roles* like cold emailers or lead gen folks?\n* Do you rely more on LinkedIn → enrichment tools?\n* Communities, directories, marketplaces?\n* Or is it mostly manual + scraping + enrichment?\n\nI’m not trying to spam random people, I’m trying to understand what a **reasonable, ethical workflow** looks like for reaching this niche.\n\nAny guidance, tools, or real-world processes would help a lot!\n\nAppreciate it.",

          "text": "Kinda ironic that you're trying to cold email the cold emailers tbh. Those people have the most finely tuned spam filters and skepticism of anyone.\n\nLinkedIn Sales Nav plus enrichment is the standard workflow. Find people with titles like outbound manager, lead gen specialist, growth marketer, then run them through an enrichment tool to get emails. Just know that this audience gets hammered with pitches constantly so your messaging better be damn good.\n\nCommunities are actually your best bet here. Cold email Twitter, outbound focused Slack groups, subreddits like this one, Facebook groups for agency owners. These people self-identify and hang out in specific places. Building presence there beats scraping emails because you get warm inbound instead of fighting through their filters.\n\nOur users who sell to this market usually find that cold email ironically performs the worst. The audience is too savvy and too annoyed by bad outreach. What works better is content that demonstrates you actually understand their problems, then letting them come to you.\n\nIf you're set on outbound though, keep your list tiny and hyper-relevant. Maybe 50-100 people max that you actually research individually. Personalization needs to be real, not merge field crap they'll spot instantly. Reference something specific they posted or a problem you know they have.\n\nThe ethical workflow you're asking about is basically just don't buy lists, verify everything before sending, and accept that small targeted batches beat mass blasting every time. Especially with this audience.",

Most teams I’ve seen start with LinkedIn role + behavior signals (titles, posts, tools in bio), then enrich selectively instead of buying lists. The cleaner path tends to be communities/directories → opt-in → email later, with cold email used sparingly for validation, not scale. Buying “lead gen” lists almost always creates more deliverability problems than traction.",
