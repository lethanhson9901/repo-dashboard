      "text": "Hey everyone\n\nI've been working on a tool called [LeadsByLocation](https://leadsbylocation.com) and I'm looking for honest feedback from people who actually do client outreach to local businesses.\n\nThe problem it solves: if you sell web design, SEO, or any digital service to local businesses, you know how tedious prospecting is. Browsing Google Maps, clicking through listings one by one, checking if they have a website, testing how bad it is, copying contact info into a spreadsheet. It takes hours before you have anyone worth calling.\n\nLeadsByLocation lets you search a keyword and city (like \"plumber in Denver\") and instantly pulls up a list of businesses with their ratings, reviews, contact info, and the part I think is most useful — a website performance score with specific reasons like \"no SSL, 6 second load time, not mobile friendly.\" So you're not just getting a list of names, you're getting a built-in pitch angle for each one.\n\nI'm giving out a  free Solo plan for a full month COUPON to anyone who wants to try it. No credit card, no strings. All I'm asking for is real feedback, what's useful, what's confusing, what's missing.\n\nCOUPON: BETATEST\n\nYou can sign up the page and pick the solo plan, input your promo code and you should have the solo plan 100% free.\n\nNote: this is limited to only 30 people\n\nHappy to answer any questions here too.",

How fresh are the site checks and performance scores? If I call someone out on a 6s load time and they fixed it last week, that kills credibility fast.\n\nAlso curious how you handle niches where a simple site is intentional, like solo contractors who don’t care about SEO. Do you filter by signals that suggest they actually value inbound?",

A plumber with 200 reviews and a terrible website clearly cares about their reputation and has real customers, they just haven't invested in their site yet. That's a great lead. A solo contractor with 3 reviews and no website is probably living off referrals and won't care about your pitch. You can filter by min reviews to focus on businesses that are actually active and engaged online. That said, adding more intent signals (Google Ads presence, claimed GMB profile, posting frequency) is definitely on the roadmap",

A small note here is that in my area quite a lot of businesses - especially restaurants - list their facebook pages as websites, but the app still shows a score for that, and then builds the outreach recommendations based on wrong assumptions. Would be cool to add detection to see if it's actually a website or if it's a social media page, as that changes outreach strategy and customer profile (i.e shit website means they at least care a little because they had it made, a social media page means you'd likely need to also sell \\*why\\* having a website is important in the first place, and \\*how\\* it would drive up their business.",

      "text": "I launched [this tool](https://tryrebelgrowth.com) in August, and we generated approximately 27,000 USD in the last 30 days\n\nHere's what worked\n\nFacebook ads: optimize for Purchase, then obsess over your Conversion API plumbing until your event match quality sits above 6.\n\nIf Meta can’t confidently match the purchase back to a person, your “learning” is basically a blindfold.\n\nGet Pixel + CAPI working with deduping, send the right fields (email, phone, external\\_id), make sure your domain is verified, AEM is set, and your purchase event fires cleanly. Then stop spraying 40 adsets.\n\nConsolidate so you get real volume per adset. If your match score is like a 3, you’re paying extra just to confuse the algo. Fix tracking first, then test creative.\n\nGoogle Ads: bid on competitor terms.\n\nMake a separate campaign for competitor names only. Exact match, tight negatives (like the word free), low daily budget, and a landing page that compares in plain English (pricing, features, who it’s for).\n\nYour goal is to catch high intent people who are already shopping.\n\nWatch CPCs, they can get spicy.\n\nAlso, don’t get cute with trademark stuff in ad copy unless you know the rules. You can win this channel with a tiny campaign if your page doesn’t suck.\n\nSEO: target high buying intent keywords and skip the “what is…” fluff\n\nGo after queries that smell like a credit card: “best”, “pricing”, “alternatives”, “vs”, “review”, “software for”, “tool for”, “agency for”, “near me” (if local).\n\nWrite pages that answer the decision. Put the pricing, the screenshots, the comparison table, the objection handling. Update the page every month or two so it stays fresh.\n\nMost people write SEO content like a school essay. That’s why it ranks for nothing and converts like trash.\n\nWe use our own product for this.\n\nOutreach: keep the message stupid simple, no links, and send a guide after the prospect agrees\n\n\"Hey I built a resource on how we achieve XYZ, want to check it out?\" that's it\n\nThen once they resply, you send the guide where your company is mentioned or the \"hero of the guide\n\nSocial: win the first 2 seconds with a real hook, then borrow distribution from bigger accounts.\n\nMost “content strategy” is just posting into the void. You need hooks that slap, and you need existing attention.\n\nComment on big accounts where your buyers already hang out.\n\nReply fast, be helpful, be a little polarizing, and pull people back to your profile. Remix their topics with your angle. Turn one strong idea into 10 posts across formats. Social rewards gravity. If you’re posting great stuff from a dead account with no interactions, it’s like yelling in the garage.\n\nThat's it, it's better to focus on the 80/20 for each growth channel than trying to do everything perfect\n\nCheers!",

That's your list builder.\n\nThe distribution sequence after building: launch on Product Hunt targeting top 5, submit to AI directories the same day, post on Reddit and HackerNews, start daily short videos showing the tool in action.\n\nFull side project marketing playbook with Dan Kulkov's, Marc Lou's, and Sveta Bay's frameworks three different approaches that complement each other is [inside foundertoolkit](http://unicornmaking.com)..\n\nWithin 3 weeks of this sequence, AI influencers typically discover and feature tools organically. That generates free backlinks that compound for months. Within 3 months, the whole thing runs without active promotion.\n\nSveta Bay's addition that makes a measurable difference: put a CTA button on every single page of your free tool pointing to your paid product. Every visitor is a potential conversion not just an email subscriber.\n\nHas anyone here successfully used a free tool to drive signups for a paid product? What was the conversion rate?",

Sometimes a small amount of friction — like capturing an email before showing full results — can actually increase perceived value and help build a stronger long-term relationship with users.\n\n\nA free tool alone doesn’t guarantee growth. If users don’t see real value or don’t feel connected to the product, they won’t come back — no matter how smooth the funnel is.\n\n\nI think it’s less about “no friction” and more about “intentional friction” — being strategic about when and why you ask for something.\n\n\nIf you’d like, I can also make it:\nMore direct and debate-style\nMore supportive but nuanced\nOr shorter and punchier for Reddit/Twitter tone.",

As a small business owner dabbling in the realm of paid media, I'm constantly weighing the costs and benefits and not sure what to do next. \n\nWe sell bedding in US and Canada and are actively trying to expand within these markets. Right now, I really believe in Google and Facebook ads, but I understand that this is a place where you can spend a crazy amount of money on SEO and PPC services without seeing any clear results, and I would like to avoid that at any cost. The first thing that comes to mind is a paid media agency, but wouldn't that be overkill for a small company with a dozen employees and no million-dollar turnover? I also thought about freelancers and SaaS solutions, but see a number of serious difficulties with both so idk.  \n  \nI'm not asking you to recommend any specific names (pls no namedropping here), but I'd like to know what you would trust first when it comes to digital marketing for startups: Google & Facebook ads with pay-per-click or something else? (So far, we don't have much except word of mouth, a poster in Austin, and a couple of spots on local radio stations). If vector is correct and PPC will work well in my situation, would you advise me to look into turnkey performance marketing services from large agencies, or would a freelancer be enough?\n\nThank you.",

El problema de fondo es que Google usa los backlinks como proxy de reputación, y sin masa crítica de autoridad externa, el contenido solo llega hasta cierto punto.\n\n\n\nEn cuanto a los envíos a directorios: funcionan, pero como base de diversificación, no como solución principal. Lo que realmente mueve el ranking en nichos competitivos son los enlaces contextuales de sitios de autoridad media-alta en tu sector, los que viene de artículos en publicaciones especializadas, round-ups, colaboraciones editoriales o digital PR bien ejecutado.\n\n\n\nEl outreach manual tiene tasas de respuesta baísimas porque el 90% se hace mal: correos genéricos, propuestas sin valor claro, sin personalización. Lo que sí funciona es el enfoque de \"link insertion\" (ofrecer actualizar un artículo existente con tu recurso relevante) y las estrategias de broken link building en nichos con contenido desactualizado. Ambas tienen tasas de éxito significativamente mejores que el outreach estándar.\n\n\n\nLo de las agencias que dan ubicaciones sobrevaloradas es el problema más común del mercado. Antes de contratar cualquier servicio, exige ver una muestra de sus ubicaciones recientes: DR real (no manipulado), tráfico orgánico del dominio en Ahrefs, y que el contenido tenga relevancia temática real con tu nicho. Si no pueden mostrarte eso, es una señal de alarma clara.",

Even with perfect 301s, we noticed our AI visibility and citations were lagging. What eventually clicked was focusing on that internal linking (point 3) and structuring content (point 2, 7) not just for humans or traditional bots, but for an AI doing a multi-step research journey, like u/o1got mentioned. \n\n\n\nWe started treating internal links like breadcrumbs for an AI agent, making sure related topics were clearly connected. We also broke down complex topics into shorter, self-contained sections. It sounds simple, but seeing our content start appearing in AI overviews and getting cited over competitors who only focused on basic keyword stuffing was a game-changer. Took about 3-4 months of consistent effort to see those results, but it was worth it.",

AI agents are doing multi-step research journeys. They'll hit your homepage, follow internal links based on context they're building, sometimes circle back to pages they visited earlier when they find new info. Your internal linking structure matters way more than it used to because you're not just passing PageRank around, you're literally guiding an agent through a research process.\n\nThe other big thing I'm seeing: structured content wins, but not in the schema markup way everyone assumes. It's more about information hierarchy. AI models are really good at extracting from clean HTML with proper heading structures, lists, and tables. The fancy JavaScript-heavy sites that look great to humans are a mess for LLM parsing. I've seen sites with identical content get cited completely differently based purely on how clean their DOM structure is.",

It forces you to really understand the language your buyers use, which then powers everything else (landing pages, outbound, even pricing).\n\nI’d also layer in community listening no matter which playbook you pick.

They're already logged into the app, have saved payment info, Prime shipping showing — it's frictionless. The browser version is the opposite.\n\nI switched to magic links that open directly in apps (Amazon, YouTube, Shopify) and my conversion rates went up 300%. Not exaggerating. Same content, same audience, just the link changed.\n\nThe tool I use is https://tryhoox.com — they do app-to-app deep links so your followers land inside the native app instead of some broken mobile web page. Works for basically any platform where you're trying to drive action.\n\nIf you're building SaaS or doing affiliate marketing and using regular links, you're probably losing 2/3 of your potential conversions.

What helped me with a similar audience was treating “trust” like a funnel, not a vibe.\n\nInstead of chasing big influencers, I went after 10–15 mid-sized creators and newsletters whose readers matched my ICP. I offered them something very specific: a custom walkthrough, a co-branded checklist, or a data deep-dive they could share. The goal wasn’t installs, it was: can we get 20–30 of their readers into a small Zoom session where I demo and answer uncomfortable questions live?\n\nFrom those calls, I pulled two things that moved the needle: 1) exact language they used about fears and goals, which became my landing page and paywall copy; 2) 3–5 anonymous mini case studies with screenshots of how they used the product.\n\nMain point: stack a few high-trust micro-audiences plus live interactions, then recycle that proof (quotes, screenshots, outcomes) everywhere else before touching broader traffic.",

What actually works: become genuinely useful in the communities where your ICP hangs out. For investing tools, that means r/investing, r/stocks, r/algotrading, finance Twitter/X, specific Discord servers. Answer questions with depth. No links, no self-promotion. After 2-3 weeks of this, you will have DMs asking what tools you use.\n\n**Product-led conversion optimization before you acquire more.** You said free-to-paid conversion is decent but not optimized. Before spending energy getting more free users, define exactly what the \"aha moment\" is. What action correlates most with paying? Get free users to that moment faster. Even small conversion improvements at this stage are worth more than new acquisition.\n\n**Targeted outreach to your existing paying customers' networks.** Ask your current paid users: who else should know about this? Most founders are afraid to ask. Paying customers are already pre-sold on your value — they have friends who invest. A referral incentive (1 month free, extended trial) turns your 100 paid users into a distribution channel.\n\n**Niche content + SEO:** Investing tool users search for things. \"Best stock screener for X\", \"how to find undervalued stocks\", etc. One good piece of content ranking can bring 50-100 qualified visitors/day permanently.\n\nWhat's your current free-to-paid conversion rate? That number determines which of these to prioritize.",

When people searched for things like retro fashion or sustainable clothing, they were stuck on page 3-4. Traffic was around **4,900/mont**, and sales were inconsistent.\n\n\n\nAfter digging in, the main issue was obvious: **their backlink profile was weak and mostly irrelevant**, while competitors were getting links from fashion blogs, magazines, and industry sites.\n\n\n\nInstead of publishing more random content, we focused on building authority.\n\n\n\nWe created content around topics that were already trending in their niche things like sustainable fashion guides, ethical wardrobe tips, and commentary on fast fashion. Then we focused on getting those pieces featured on relevant fashion blogs and publications. For execution and outreach scale, we used **a** [**link-building service**](http://getmorebacklinks.org) **alongside internal content efforts to secure placements on niche-relevant sites.**\n\n\n\nNothing changed overnight, but within about two quarters the impact became clear:\n\n\n\n\\- **Traffic grew from** \n\n4,900 to 6,800/month (+38.8%)\n\n\n\n\\- **Overall search visibility increased by** \n\n80%\n\n\n\n\\- **Keywords in** \n\npositions 1-3 increased by 30%\n\n\n\n**- Keywords in** \n\npositions 4-10 increased by 50%\n\n\n\n**The biggest takeaway for me is that content alone wasn’t enough.

Here’s the framework I’m using now:\n\n1. Stop keyword stuffing, start entity mapping. LLMs don't care about keyword density. They care about relationships between concepts. You need to explicitly define terms and link them to known entities.\n\n2. Fix your structure. AI crawlers are lazy. If your page doesn't have flawless JSON-LD schema, clear H2/H3 hierarchies, and a tight FAQ section, they won't pull from you.\n\n3. Update your tool stack. I used to live in Surfer and Semrush, but they are still heavily optimized for the \"10 blue links\" era (mostly just giving you keyword counts to hit). I tested a few alternatives and have been using Nuwtonic a lot lately. It pulls live GSC data to find exact technical gaps and builds entity-first content briefs rather than just vomiting keyword lists. It just seems slightly more aligned with how LLMs actually parse and retrieve data compared to the older tools.\n\n4. Information Gain is non-negotiable. If your post just regurgitates the current top 3 results, the AI will ignore you and just cite the consensus source. You have to include a unique data point, original quote, or specific use-case.\n\nIs anyone else actively tracking referral traffic from AI bots yet?

      "text": "\nI used to think a flatlined business meant I needed more features. When my directory submission SaaS sat at four hundred MRR for three straight months, I opened VS Code by default. New reports. New filters. New onboarding tweaks. Nothing moved the needle. Traffic was low. Conversions were average. I was polishing a product nobody was really seeing.\n\nThe uncomfortable shift started when I forced myself to stop building for a month and just study how other small founders actually grew. I went through a [bunch of case studies on FounderToolkit](http://unicornmaking.com) and the common thread was brutal. The winners were not the best products. They were the ones that had one or two channels completely dialed in and an offer that made saying yes feel cheap compared to the pain.\n\nSo I treated my business like a growth lab instead of a feature factory. First step was picking a main channel. I chose Reddit because my customers already hang out there. Instead of link dropping, I behaved like a regular user. Answered questions, shared numbers, told exactly what worked and what failed in my own launches. Only after building some trust I started mentioning the product in context. The crazy part was people asked for the link themselves.\n\nAt the same time I realized my “we are on a few sites” directory strategy was a joke. I went all in and listed on every relevant directory and niche showcase I could find, using curated lists instead of guessing. Most of them send tiny trickles individually but stacked together they turned into a predictable stream of visitors. A couple of them hit and keep sending signups months later without me doing anything.\n\nThe last sacred cow was pricing. I stopped pricing based on what felt safe and started thinking like my buyers. Indie founders will try a tool if it is obviously worth more than it costs and the decision feels low risk. Tiny tweaks there had more impact than any feature I shipped last year.​\n\nThe controversial part is this. For a stalled business, opening your editor is often the worst growth move you can make. You probably do not need a better product yet. You need more people seeing it and a clearer reason to buy right now.",

I kept it simple and boring just to understand and learn the process.\n\nPart of the process was learning sales. I had zero idea how to market or grow. So I spent money on ads, tried social media marketing, etc. And nothing really worked. I didn't have a single sale.\n\nFor the first 8 months, I had around 1,500 users come and go, with no sales. [Link for proof](https://imgur.com/MmMbfZ4). This was spending so many hours each month working to get users with no sales. I basically burned out and gave up on the site and pivoted to a new tool.\n\nThe new tool automatically created blog posts targeting keywords to grow SEO/GEO presence. I figured why not, and set it up for my PDF site. All I did was target keywords I figured people might search for around PDFs. The system publishes 3 posts per day.\n\nThat setup was the last time I touched it. No promotion, not new features, nothing.\n\nSince that setup in Oct 2025, my site averages around 600 users per month - [link to proof](https://imgur.com/VJ5xW3p)\n\nThe best part of it, I've made three sales. I know it isn't groundbreaking, but it covers the cost of the site and is very cool to see still new to building and shipping. It is very ironic that when I stopped working day and night for users is when I got actual paying users lol.\n\nHappy to answer any questions, but figured a post like this might help some of you that are stuck with no customers.

In my experience, the real value of AI right now is in making the *right* work faster, not necessarily automating everything.\n\nFor example, I've been using AI to personalize my outreach emails, and I've seen a bump in response rates. But that only works if the offer is solid to begin with. If the underlying product-market fit isn't there, AI just gets you to \"no\" faster.\n\nAnd yeah, I think there's definitely some marketing fluff around the term \"AI employee.\" It's easy to get caught up in the hype and forget the fundamentals.

And then I spend the rest of the day working on products. \n\nSo I guess yes, it's speeding up busywork - but so much of marketing is just busywork, that it can be truly wildly valuable. \n\nNow I'm driving just as much revenue as I was from paid ads, by just spending a few hrs per day - and I expect I can improve and speed up the agents even more.",

What surprised me most is how different it feels compared to traditional SEO.Some pages that barely rank on Google still show up consistently in AI answers, while some high‑ranking sites almost never get mentioned. A few patterns that seem to matter:1. Clear, direct answers: AI tends to reference pages that answer directly without filler.2. Structured content: Headings, bullet lists, and short sections help AI parse and reference.3. Community context: Pages mentioned in forums or niche discussions often get more traction in AI responses.4. Consistency over time: Pages that remain accurate and focused tend to be referenced more when patterns are tracked.Manual tracking across models gets messy quickly. I’ve been organizing observations with a small workflow helper (AnswerManiac), which makes trends easier to spot.Has anyone else noticed this disconnect between AI visibility and Google rankings?
