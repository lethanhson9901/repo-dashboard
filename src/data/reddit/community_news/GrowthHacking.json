      "text": "Hey everyone\n\nI've been working on a tool called [LeadsByLocation](https://leadsbylocation.com) and I'm looking for honest feedback from people who actually do client outreach to local businesses.\n\nThe problem it solves: if you sell web design, SEO, or any digital service to local businesses, you know how tedious prospecting is. Browsing Google Maps, clicking through listings one by one, checking if they have a website, testing how bad it is, copying contact info into a spreadsheet. It takes hours before you have anyone worth calling.\n\nLeadsByLocation lets you search a keyword and city (like \"plumber in Denver\") and instantly pulls up a list of businesses with their ratings, reviews, contact info, and the part I think is most useful — a website performance score with specific reasons like \"no SSL, 6 second load time, not mobile friendly.\" So you're not just getting a list of names, you're getting a built-in pitch angle for each one.\n\nI'm giving out a  free Solo plan for a full month COUPON to anyone who wants to try it. No credit card, no strings. All I'm asking for is real feedback, what's useful, what's confusing, what's missing.\n\nCOUPON: BETATEST\n\nYou can sign up the page and pick the solo plan, input your promo code and you should have the solo plan 100% free.\n\nNote: this is limited to only 30 people\n\nHappy to answer any questions here too.",

A plumber with 200 reviews and a terrible website clearly cares about their reputation and has real customers, they just haven't invested in their site yet. That's a great lead. A solo contractor with 3 reviews and no website is probably living off referrals and won't care about your pitch. You can filter by min reviews to focus on businesses that are actually active and engaged online. That said, adding more intent signals (Google Ads presence, claimed GMB profile, posting frequency) is definitely on the roadmap",

      "text": "\nNo AI-generated fluff. No $2,000 course upsell. Just the actual stuff that moved the needle.\n\n**Background:** Mid-2024 I launched a B2B SaaS content site in a competitive niche (marketing analytics). By late 2025, we hit 130K monthly organic sessions and it now drives 80% of our qualified pipeline. Here's what actually worked — and a few things I wasted months on.\n\n\n**1. We killed our blog strategy and rebuilt it around pain points, not keywords**\n\nOur first 3 months we did what everyone does: plugged seed keywords into Ahrefs, sorted by volume, and started writing.\n\nThe result? 40 posts. Almost zero conversions. Decent traffic on a handful, but the wrong people.\n\nThe shift: We started interviewing our sales team and pulling questions from customer support tickets. We built content around what people were *actually confused about* — not what a tool told us had volume.\n\nExample: \"how to track competitor share of voice\" had almost no search volume. We published it anyway. It's now our #2 converting page because the people searching it are exactly who we sell to.\n\n**Takeaway: Low-volume, high-intent keywords will outperform high-volume vanity keywords almost every time for business outcomes.**\n\n\n**2. Internal linking is stupidly underrated**\n\nI'm not talking about throwing random links in your posts. I mean building a disciplined topic cluster architecture.\n\nWe created 6 pillar pages (2,500-4,000 words each) and linked 8-15 supporting articles to each one. Every supporting article links back to the pillar and to 2-3 siblings.\n\nAfter restructuring our internal links, one pillar page went from position 14 to position 3 in about 6 weeks — with zero new backlinks. Google could finally understand what we were actually about.\n\n**Takeaway: Before you build more backlinks, audit your internal linking. It's the highest-ROI SEO activity most people ignore.**\n\n\n**3. We stopped publishing 3x/week and started publishing 1x/week at 3x the quality**\n\nHot take: publishing frequency is a vanity metric.\n\nWe cut our output from 12 posts/month to 4. But each one got:\n\n- A custom diagram or chart (made in Figma, takes 30 min)\n- Real examples, not hypothetical ones\n- An original data point or survey stat when possible\n- A genuinely helpful structure (not just H2s stuffed with keywords)\n\nOur average time-on-page went from 1:20 to 4:45. Pages started ranking faster. And we stopped cannibalizing our own keywords.\n\n**Takeaway: One post that becomes THE resource on a topic > four forgettable posts that rank on page 3.**\n\n\n**4. Technical SEO basics compound more than you think**\n\nNot the sexy stuff. The boring stuff:\n\n- Fixed 400+ broken internal links (Screaming Frog, took a weekend)\n- Compressed images site-wide (saved 2.1s avg load time)\n- Added proper schema markup to all posts (FAQ, HowTo, Article)\n- Fixed orphan pages — 30+ posts had ZERO internal links pointing to them\n- Submitted a clean XML sitemap and pruned 80 thin/outdated pages\n\nNone of this individually was a game-changer. Together, over 3-4 months, we saw a ~25% lift in indexed pages ranking in the top 20.\n\n**Takeaway: Technical SEO isn't a one-time audit. Treat it like hygiene — do a little every month.**\n\n\n**5. Distribution > creation (the thing I learned way too late)**\n\nFor the first 6 months, we'd hit publish and... wait. Maybe share it on LinkedIn once.\n\nNow every piece of content gets:\n\n- Repurposed into a LinkedIn carousel (our best channel for B2B reach)\n- Submitted to 2-3 relevant niche communities (not spam — genuine answers that link to the full post)\n- Turned into a short email to our list with a \"here's why this matters to you\" angle\n- Quoted in responses on Quora/Reddit where someone is asking exactly what the post answers\n\nThis alone 3x'd our first-week traffic on new posts and improved early engagement signals that (I believe) helped ranking velocity.\n\n**Takeaway: If you're spending 8 hours writing and 0 hours distributing, flip that ratio to at least 50/50.**\n\n\n**6. Things that were a waste of time (for us)**\n\nBeing honest here:\n\n- **Obsessing over DA/DR scores** for link building. Some of our best-converting referral traffic comes from niche sites with DA 25.\n- **Programmatic SEO** before we had topical authority. We tried auto-generating 500 location pages. Google ignored most of them.\n- **Hiring cheap freelance writers** to scale output. We burned ~$6K on content we either rewrote entirely or unpublished.\n- **Chasing featured snippets specifically.** They came naturally once the content was genuinely the best answer. Trying to reverse-engineer them was a time sink.\n\n\n**The honest truth about timelines**\n\nMonths 1-3: Basically nothing. A few posts trickling in 10–50 visits/month.\n\nMonths 4-6: Slow compounding. A couple posts hit page 1 for long-tails. ~5K/month.\n\nMonths 7-10: The hockey stick starts. Pillar pages climb. Internal linking kicks in. ~40K/month.\n\nMonths 11-14: Everything compounds. New content ranks faster because site authority is there. Hit 130K.\n\n**SEO is a slow game that rewards patience and consistency. If you need results in 30 days, run ads. If you're building for 12+ months, SEO will be the single best investment you make.**\n\n\nHappy to answer questions about any of this. What's working (or not working) for you all right now? Drop your biggest SEO challenge and I'll give you my honest take.\n",

      "text": "Im gonna be honest this experiment humbled me.\n\n\n\nI run a small online business. Been at it for a few years now. Things are going okay, growing steadily, but i always had this nagging feeling that im busy but not productive. Like im running on a treadmill.\n\n\n\nSo last month i decided to track literally everything. Every task, every hour, every \"quick check\" on analytics, every time i opened instagram to \"monitor engagement,\" every email i wrote, every call i took. All of it. I used a simple spreadsheet, nothing fancy. Just timestamp, what i did, and how long it took.\n\n\n\nAfter 30 days i sat down and categorized everything into three buckets:\n\n\n\n1. Revenue generating - things that directly led to money coming in\n\n2. Foundation building - things that dont make money today but build something for tomorrow (systems, relationships, content)\n\n3. Busywork - everything else\n\n\n\nThe results were honestly embarrassing.\n\n\n\nOut of roughly 240 working hours that month:\n\n\n\n\\- Revenue generating activities: about 28 hours (12%)\n\n\\- Foundation building: about 20 hours (8%)\n\n\\- Busywork: about 192 hours (80%)\n\n\n\nEighty percent. I spent 80% of my time on stuff that didnt matter.\n\n\n\nThe biggest time killers:\n\n\n\n\\- Checking analytics dashboards multiple times a day when nothing was going to change between checks. This alone was eating 1-2 hours daily.\n\n\\- Responding to emails that didnt need a response or could have waited.\n\n\\- \"Researching\" competitors which was really just scrolling their social media.\n\n\\- Redesigning things that were already working fine because i got bored of how they looked.\n\n\\- Attending networking calls that went nowhere.\n\n\n\nThe 20% that actually moved the needle:\n\n\n\n\\- Direct outreach to potential partners and clients\n\n\\- Creating actual content (not planning content, not researching content, actually making it)\n\n\\- Improving the parts of my funnel where people were dropping off\n\n\\- Having real conversations with existing customers about what they needed\n\n\n\nAfter seeing this data i restructured my entire week. Now i block the first 4 hours of every day exclusively for revenue generating or foundation building work. No email, no analytics, no social media. Those things get a 1 hour window in the afternoon.\n\n\n\nIts been 3 weeks since i made the switch. Revenue is up about 15% and i actually feel like i have more free time even though im technically working the same hours.\n\n\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is most of us are addicted to feeling busy because it feels like progress. But activity is not achievement.\n\n\n\nAnyone else done something similar? Curious what other peoples ratios look like. I have a feeling 80/20 busywork might actually be generous compared to some people.",

It was that only 28 hours were directly tied to money. That’s basically one week out of a month actually pushing revenue.\n\nIf someone forced you to only work 2 hours a day, you’d immediately cut 90 percent of that busywork without thinking. That’s usually the test I use. If I had to make money in 14 days or I’m broke, what do I do? It’s never redesigning a landing page.\n\nAlso worth tracking next month: which specific revenue actions actually closed. Not all outreach is equal. Not all content is equal. You might find 10 of those 28 hours did almost all the lifting.\n\nMost people don’t have a time problem. They have a courage problem. Revenue work feels exposed. Busywork feels safe.",

Instead of manually digging through data or typing out routine emails the AI handles the plumbing in the background.

When I finally audited my own time, the results were uncomfortable. What changed everything wasn't discipline or better habits. It was automation. Removing the tasks that didn't need me and protecting the hours that did.\n\nWhat you've essentially done is a manual time audit that surfaces exactly what automation is designed to solve. The items on your busywork list, analytics checks, routine email responses, repetitive admin, those aren't just time wasters. They're automation candidates. The reason they ate your time isn't a discipline problem. It's a systems problem.\n\nThe ratio you found is also telling you something about where your real value lives. 28 hours of revenue-generating work produced your current results. What happens when that becomes 50 hours because the other 22 are automated away? Your 15% revenue increase in three weeks came from attention, not more hours. That's the proof of concept. Automation just makes it permanent.",

The ratio was almost identical at every level — most people confused motion with progress.\n\nThe dashboard checking habit you mentioned is one of the worst offenders. At IBM we had managers who spent 2 hours every morning reviewing dashboards that updated weekly. They were looking at the same numbers they saw yesterday. The fix was simple — set a specific day and time for data review and stick to it. Once a week for most metrics, once a day maximum for anything time-sensitive.\n\nYour three-bucket framework is solid. The one thing I'd add is that the busywork category usually disguises itself as urgent. Emails feel urgent. Tweaking your website feels productive. Reorganising your project board feels like progress. None of it moves revenue.\n\nThe blocking strategy you landed on is what every high-performer I ever managed figured out eventually. Protect your first hours for the work that actually generates money. Everything else fits into whatever time is left. Not the other way around.\n\nYour 80/20 ratio is probably generous.

Then stop spraying 40 adsets.\n\nConsolidate so you get real volume per adset. If your match score is like a 3, you’re paying extra just to confuse the algo. Fix tracking first, then test creative.\n\nGoogle Ads: bid on competitor terms.\n\nMake a separate campaign for competitor names only. Exact match, tight negatives (like the word free), low daily budget, and a landing page that compares in plain English (pricing, features, who it’s for).\n\nYour goal is to catch high intent people who are already shopping.\n\nWatch CPCs, they can get spicy.\n\nAlso, don’t get cute with trademark stuff in ad copy unless you know the rules. You can win this channel with a tiny campaign if your page doesn’t suck.\n\nSEO: target high buying intent keywords and skip the “what is…” fluff\n\nGo after queries that smell like a credit card: “best”, “pricing”, “alternatives”, “vs”, “review”, “software for”, “tool for”, “agency for”, “near me” (if local).\n\nWrite pages that answer the decision. Put the pricing, the screenshots, the comparison table, the objection handling. Update the page every month or two so it stays fresh.\n\nMost people write SEO content like a school essay. That’s why it ranks for nothing and converts like trash.\n\nWe use our own product for this.\n\nOutreach: keep the message stupid simple, no links, and send a guide after the prospect agrees\n\n\"Hey I built a resource on how we achieve XYZ, want to check it out?\" that's it\n\nThen once they resply, you send the guide where your company is mentioned or the \"hero of the guide\n\nSocial: win the first 2 seconds with a real hook, then borrow distribution from bigger accounts.\n\nMost “content strategy” is just posting into the void. You need hooks that slap, and you need existing attention.\n\nComment on big accounts where your buyers already hang out.\n\nReply fast, be helpful, be a little polarizing, and pull people back to your profile. Remix their topics with your angle. Turn one strong idea into 10 posts across formats. Social rewards gravity. If you’re posting great stuff from a dead account with no interactions, it’s like yelling in the garage.\n\nThat's it, it's better to focus on the 80/20 for each growth channel than trying to do everything perfect\n\nCheers!",

      "text": "For the past few months, I’ve been building my SaaS product completely solo. That means nights and weekends spent coding, marketing, and everything in between. No team, no virtual assistants, and no agencies, just me, my laptop, and plenty of coffee. \n\nThis past month felt like a real turning point for me. I got 2,150 organic visitors to my site, which led to 31 trial signups and ultimately 7 paying customers. That brought in $2,795 in revenue, which averages out to about $1.3 per visitor. And the best part is, I didn’t spend a single dollar on ads. \n\nSo, what made the difference? Let me walk you through the tools and strategies that really moved the needle. \n\nI used [Typedream](http://typedream.com/) to build my homepage and pricing pages quickly. It only took me about two hours, and everything was SEO-friendly and mobile responsive without any complicated coding or design headaches. \n\nFor backlink building, I relied on the [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/). Manually submitting my website to hundreds of startup directories would have taken me around 20 hours, but with this tool, I did it in one click. My domain rating jumped from zero to six, and Google indexed my site in just four days, which gave me some crucial early momentum. \n\nTo support content marketing, I used [PostKit](http://postkit.pro/) to post two blog articles targeting keywords with low competition. One of those posts ranked in the top 30 search results within 10 days. I also kept a public changelog to show that the project is alive and active, which helped build trust and conversions. \n\nFor onboarding, I set up a simple five-step drip email sequence using [MailMaestro](https://www.maestrolabs.com/). I welcomed new users, shared helpful tips on features, highlighted testimonials, showcased a mini case study, and asked for feedback. This sequence played a big role in turning 31 trial users into paying customers. \n\nThe biggest lessons I learned are not to chase flashy tools but to pick simple, reliable ones that help you work without friction. Despite not being glamorous, directory backlinks are still effective. Slow and consistent growth beats flashy viral hacks. And most importantly, your goal should be revenue per visitor, not just traffic. \n\nIf you want, I’m happy to share email templates, blog outlines, and even the keywords I focused on. This month was my first time making real profit as a solo founder, and I’m finally starting to feel momentum.",

      "text": "Most growth strategies require either money or an existing audience. This one requires neither.\n\nThe approach is called side project marketing. Build a free tool that solves a small problem connected to your paid product. The free tool gets organic traffic, builds your email list, and funnels users toward your main product without ad spend.\n\nDan Kulkov's exact sequence:\n\nFind a problem connected to your paid product with at least 1,000 monthly searches. Build a 2-screen AI wrapper input on screen one, results on screen two. Use GPT-3.5 with a detailed prompt for fast results. Critical: don't gate the results behind an email. Let people use it freely. More trials means more organic sharing. On the results screen, offer a valuable resource that requires an email to unlock. That's your list builder.\n\nThe distribution sequence after building: launch on Product Hunt targeting top 5, submit to AI directories the same day, post on Reddit and HackerNews, start daily short videos showing the tool in action.\n\nFull side project marketing playbook with Dan Kulkov's, Marc Lou's, and Sveta Bay's frameworks three different approaches that complement each other is [inside foundertoolkit](http://unicornmaking.com)..\n\nWithin 3 weeks of this sequence, AI influencers typically discover and feature tools organically. That generates free backlinks that compound for months. Within 3 months, the whole thing runs without active promotion.\n\nSveta Bay's addition that makes a measurable difference: put a CTA button on every single page of your free tool pointing to your paid product. Every visitor is a potential conversion not just an email subscriber.\n\nHas anyone here successfully used a free tool to drive signups for a paid product? What was the conversion rate?",

That part makes sense.\n\n\nBut I don’t think removing all friction is always the answer. Sometimes a small amount of friction — like capturing an email before showing full results — can actually increase perceived value and help build a stronger long-term relationship with users.\n\n\nA free tool alone doesn’t guarantee growth. If users don’t see real value or don’t feel connected to the product, they won’t come back — no matter how smooth the funnel is.\n\n\nI think it’s less about “no friction” and more about “intentional friction” — being strategic about when and why you ask for something.\n\n\nIf you’d like, I can also make it:\nMore direct and debate-style\nMore supportive but nuanced\nOr shorter and punchier for Reddit/Twitter tone.",

Even with perfect 301s, we noticed our AI visibility and citations were lagging. What eventually clicked was focusing on that internal linking (point 3) and structuring content (point 2, 7) not just for humans or traditional bots, but for an AI doing a multi-step research journey, like u/o1got mentioned. \n\n\n\nWe started treating internal links like breadcrumbs for an AI agent, making sure related topics were clearly connected. We also broke down complex topics into shorter, self-contained sections. It sounds simple, but seeing our content start appearing in AI overviews and getting cited over competitors who only focused on basic keyword stuffing was a game-changer.

          "text": "good tips!  \nI've analyzed a ridiculous amount of AI agent crawl data and one thing that's not talked about enough: the crawl patterns are completely different from traditional search bots.  \nTraditional SEO assumes a bot hits your page, parses it, and leaves. AI agents are doing multi-step research journeys. They'll hit your homepage, follow internal links based on context they're building, sometimes circle back to pages they visited earlier when they find new info. Your internal linking structure matters way more than it used to because you're not just passing PageRank around, you're literally guiding an agent through a research process.\n\nThe other big thing I'm seeing: structured content wins, but not in the schema markup way everyone assumes. It's more about information hierarchy. AI models are really good at extracting from clean HTML with proper heading structures, lists, and tables. The fancy JavaScript-heavy sites that look great to humans are a mess for LLM parsing. I've seen sites with identical content get cited completely differently based purely on how clean their DOM structure is.",

The items I'd double down on from experience with B2B SaaS clients:\n\nEntity optimization (your point 5) is doing more heavy lifting than most people realize. It's not just about on page context. LLMs cross reference your brand information across your site, schema, directories, and third party profiles. Inconsistencies get you filtered out regardless of content quality. Cleaning up entity signals alone has moved the needle more than any single content change we've made.\n\nOriginal insights (point 6) are where real differentiation lives. LLMs don't need another version of generic advice they can already synthesize. They need content that fills gaps they can't cover on their own: judgment calls, experience based comparisons, genuinely novel data. That's what earns citations.\n\nOne addition I'd make: structure content for extraction specifically. Clear, concise answers positioned in the first few sentences of a section before going deeper. LLMs pull from the most direct statement they can find, so burying your best insight deep in a paragraph means it might never get surfaced.\n\nWe break down how these elements work together at [www.exaltgrowth.com](http://www.exaltgrowth.com). The biggest takeaway from running integrated SEO+GEO strategies is that no single tactic on this list moves results dramatically in isolation. The compound effect of getting several of them right simultaneously is where the real gains come from.",

Paid acquisition is eating budget and we need organic to start pulling its weight.\n\n\n\nContent and on-page SEO are in decent shape. The bottleneck is clearly authority, we're getting outranked by competitors who have weaker content but stronger backlink profiles. Tried a couple of outreach campaigns in-house and the response rates were terrible. Tried one agency and got overpriced placements that moved nothing.\n\n\n\nRecently started seeing [Link-Building tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org) come up in growth communities, specifically around building foundational authority through directory submissions. The positioning makes sense to me establish baseline credibility first, then layer more aggressive outreach on top. But I haven't seen many growth hackers talk about directory submissions specifically.\n\n\n\nHas anyone used directory submissions as part of a broader growth strategy and seen measurable ranking impact? And what link building approach has genuinely moved organic growth numbers for you rather than just looking good in a report?",

El problema de fondo es que Google usa los backlinks como proxy de reputación, y sin masa crítica de autoridad externa, el contenido solo llega hasta cierto punto.\n\n\n\nEn cuanto a los envíos a directorios: funcionan, pero como base de diversificación, no como solución principal. Lo que realmente mueve el ranking en nichos competitivos son los enlaces contextuales de sitios de autoridad media-alta en tu sector, los que viene de artículos en publicaciones especializadas, round-ups, colaboraciones editoriales o digital PR bien ejecutado.\n\n\n\nEl outreach manual tiene tasas de respuesta baísimas porque el 90% se hace mal: correos genéricos, propuestas sin valor claro, sin personalización. Lo que sí funciona es el enfoque de \"link insertion\" (ofrecer actualizar un artículo existente con tu recurso relevante) y las estrategias de broken link building en nichos con contenido desactualizado. Ambas tienen tasas de éxito significativamente mejores que el outreach estándar.\n\n\n\nLo de las agencias que dan ubicaciones sobrevaloradas es el problema más común del mercado. Antes de contratar cualquier servicio, exige ver una muestra de sus ubicaciones recientes: DR real (no manipulado), tráfico orgánico del dominio en Ahrefs, y que el contenido tenga relevancia temática real con tu nicho. Si no pueden mostrarte eso, es una señal de alarma clara.",

What actually works: become genuinely useful in the communities where your ICP hangs out. For investing tools, that means r/investing, r/stocks, r/algotrading, finance Twitter/X, specific Discord servers. Answer questions with depth. No links, no self-promotion. After 2-3 weeks of this, you will have DMs asking what tools you use.\n\n**Product-led conversion optimization before you acquire more.** You said free-to-paid conversion is decent but not optimized. Before spending energy getting more free users, define exactly what the \"aha moment\" is. What action correlates most with paying? Get free users to that moment faster. Even small conversion improvements at this stage are worth more than new acquisition.\n\n**Targeted outreach to your existing paying customers' networks.** Ask your current paid users: who else should know about this? Most founders are afraid to ask. Paying customers are already pre-sold on your value — they have friends who invest. A referral incentive (1 month free, extended trial) turns your 100 paid users into a distribution channel.\n\n**Niche content + SEO:** Investing tool users search for things. \"Best stock screener for X\", \"how to find undervalued stocks\", etc. One good piece of content ranking can bring 50-100 qualified visitors/day permanently.\n\nWhat's your current free-to-paid conversion rate? That number determines which of these to prioritize.",

The point is to pick one that matches your product, price, and founder skills, then go uncomfortably deep on it.\n\nFor early-stage B2B, I’ve seen “Weightless” plus “AI Search” work best together: long-form problem content that feeds both Google and ChatGPT/Perplexity, then a very tight CTA into either a waitlist or a demo. It forces you to really understand the language your buyers use, which then powers everything else (landing pages, outbound, even pricing).\n\nI’d also layer in community listening no matter which playbook you pick. I use SparkToro to find where people hang out, F5Bot to track keywords, and Pulse for Reddit to catch those specific threads where your exact ICP is complaining in public so you can join the convo with something useful, not pitchy.\n\n",

Those strategies are gold - especially the Wave Surfer approach.\n\nReal talk though, the thing that changed my online monetization wasn't a launch strategy. It was something WAY more tactical: deep linking. \n\nThe thing nobody tells you is that when someone clicks a regular affiliate link from social media, they land on this clunky mobile web browser — not the actual app. And people just don't buy there. They're already logged into the app, have saved payment info, Prime shipping showing — it's frictionless. The browser version is the opposite.\n\nI switched to magic links that open directly in apps (Amazon, YouTube, Shopify) and my conversion rates went up 300%. Not exaggerating. Same content, same audience, just the link changed.\n\nThe tool I use is https://tryhoox.com — they do app-to-app deep links so your followers land inside the native app instead of some broken mobile web page. Works for basically any platform where you're trying to drive action.\n\nIf you're building SaaS or doing affiliate marketing and using regular links, you're probably losing 2/3 of your potential conversions.

I kept it simple and boring just to understand and learn the process.\n\nPart of the process was learning sales. I had zero idea how to market or grow. So I spent money on ads, tried social media marketing, etc. And nothing really worked. I didn't have a single sale.\n\nFor the first 8 months, I had around 1,500 users come and go, with no sales. [Link for proof](https://imgur.com/MmMbfZ4). This was spending so many hours each month working to get users with no sales. I basically burned out and gave up on the site and pivoted to a new tool.\n\nThe new tool automatically created blog posts targeting keywords to grow SEO/GEO presence. I figured why not, and set it up for my PDF site. All I did was target keywords I figured people might search for around PDFs. The system publishes 3 posts per day.\n\nThat setup was the last time I touched it. No promotion, not new features, nothing.\n\nSince that setup in Oct 2025, my site averages around 600 users per month - [link to proof](https://imgur.com/VJ5xW3p)\n\nThe best part of it, I've made three sales. I know it isn't groundbreaking, but it covers the cost of the site and is very cool to see still new to building and shipping. It is very ironic that when I stopped working day and night for users is when I got actual paying users lol.\n\nHappy to answer any questions, but figured a post like this might help some of you that are stuck with no customers.

Suddenly, we were reaching exactly the kind of audience we had been chasing: people who were genuinely interested, highly engaged, and responsive to our campaigns. The best part was how efficient and accessible it felt. Campaigns launched faster, reporting made sense, and we could see which placements were actually driving results. It wasn’t magic targeting and creative still mattered but finally, it felt like our message wasn’t just floating in the void. \n\n",

I wake up and theres replies in my inbox and meetings in my calendar that I didnt manually set up\n\nnow heres the thing people get wrong about this. they think the AI part is the hard part. its not. the hard part is the ICP doc. its the thinking. its sitting down for half a day and really figuring out who your ideal client is, what keeps them up at night, what words they use to describe their problems, what makes them say yes vs what makes them ghost you\n\nI've seen people build incredible automation workflows with terrible ICPs and then wonder why nobody replies. garbage in garbage out. doesnt matter how good your tech stack is.\n\nthe other thing is you still need to know how to sell. the bot books the meeting. I still need to show up and close. if you cant sell on a call the best outreach system in the world wont help you. I've been selling since I was in my early 20s working retail and honestly thats the skill that made everything else possible. not the tech\n\nalso quick note for people wondering about deliverability. if you're sending 500 cold emails a day from one domain you're gonna get destroyed. warm up your domains, rotate them, keep volume reasonable per domain. the bot handles this but you need to set it up properly or you'll burn your reputation in a week\n\nanyway not trying to sell anything here I dont even have a product lol. just wanted to share because I spent years doing outreach manually and I cant believe how long I waited to automate this. the roi on the time I spent building it was probably the best investment I made this year\n\ncurious if anyone else built their own outreach system from scratch vs using an off the shelf tool. what are you using and hows it working",

LeadsRover has been pretty helpful for finding those high-intent leads on Reddit and drafting responses that sound natural, which saves a ton of time. You still need to guide it with a good ICP, but it handles a lot of the initial legwork.\n\nI think the key is really committing to that upfront research.

Finally sat down and wrote out like 5 pages... pain points by role, specific objections, even the language they use on linkedin. Night and day difference.\n\nOne thing I'd add on the deliverability side since you mentioned it briefly - the domain rotation stuff is where most people completely screw themselves. I was burning through domains before I started using maildoso to handle that whole setup, the SPF/DKIM/DMARC stuff was killing me trying to do it manually across like 12 domains. Not saying everyone needs that but if you're running volume it saves a lot of headaches.\n\nCurious about your enrichment step though - are you using clay for that or something custom? Thats the part of my workflow that still feels janky tbh. Like sometimes the data is just... wrong, and then the personalization sounds dumb because its referencing a job posting from 8 months ago or whatever.",

      "text": "I’ve noticed that a lot of growth marketing tools look amazing on paper but fall apart once you actually try to use them in a real campaign. Fancy dashboards, huge feature lists, and glowing testimonials don’t always translate into better conversions or easier workflows.\n\nAfter wasting budget on tools that didn’t fit my process, I started being more deliberate about validation. Before committing, I look for repeated patterns across different sources. I read Reddit threads to see real complaints, watch walkthrough videos to understand actual workflows, and check independent review platforms like reSoftview to see how features, pricing, and user feedback are summarized in one place.\n\nEven then, I’ve learned the real test is running a small experiment first. A short campaign or limited trial usually tells you more than any review ever will. If the setup takes too long or integrations break, it’s a sign to move on early.\n\nFor people here who test growth tools regularly, what’s your process before committing to a new SaaS product? Do you have a checklist or framework you follow so you don’t waste time and budget on tools that look great in reviews but don’t deliver in practice?",

For example, try using it for one week while keeping everything else the same, then switch back to your original process and compare results. If you see significant improvements in efficiency or ROI, that's a good sign the tool is worth adding to your stack.",

Quick setup, and easy to validate with a real test instead of a sales call.\n\nmy rule now: if I can’t prove impact in 14 days, I don’t add it to the stack.",
