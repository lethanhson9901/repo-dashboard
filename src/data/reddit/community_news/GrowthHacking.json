To the average user, the differentiation isn't always obvious at first.\n\n3. Advice: Release as soon as possible. Seriously.

No credit card autofills, no Apple Pay, super slow load times. My last product saw 1.2% conversion in those browsers vs 4% in Safari.\n\nQuick fix is routing users to their native browser before checkout. Saw a 15% revenue boost just from that redirect. Definitely check your analytics by browser type.\n\nIf Instagram or Facebook traffic converts way lower than Safari, that's your growth leak. https://tryhoox.com handles this automatically if you want to test it out.\n\nSolid work on the app btw.

Then slice it by source (ASO vs Instagram/TikTok vs referrals) and by device. You’ll quickly see which step is leaking for which channel.\n\n\n\nOn paid traffic, the in-app browser thing is real for web flows, but for an app like this I’d lean hard into deep links that jump straight to the App Store instead of a landing page when coming from IG/FB/TikTok. If you ever spin up a separate web paywall or pro plan, then something like tryhoox, Branch, and even Pulse for Reddit come in handy: Branch for sane deep links, tryhoox for redirecting trash browsers, and Pulse for Reddit to spot threads where people complain about mobile editing pain and reply with real examples.\n\n\n\nThe main point: instrument everything around that first export and fix drops step by step instead of guessing from top-line downloads.",

Interesting, because it feels like SEO is shifting from chasing rankings on search engines to actually influencing the way language models generate their responses (and probably trying to deceive them). And, TBH, that's quite terrifying...\n\nIn my small research for my own startup I also came across some AI marketing tools (like Snoika / SemRush / etc.), which used for tracking LLM-related mentions and optimizing content strategies specifically for AI output, but still being curious what shall I do to improve my positions. Just post blog content? How shall LLM notice me in this huge ocean of information?...   \n  \nHas anyone else started to pivot their marketing towards AI SEO?

Traditional SEO won't disappear but it's definitely not the whole game anymore.\n\nFrom what I've been researching, the key difference is that Al models pull from a much wider context than just meta descriptions and backlinks. They're synthesizing information from multiple sources to form recommendations, so your brand needs to be consistently represented across the web in ways that Al can understand and trust. That means authoritative content, third-party mentions, clear positioning, all that stuff.\n\nBut here's the kicker: you have no idea what these LLMs are actually saying about you unless you're actively monitoring them. I came across Brandlight (https://brandlight.ai) while digging into this exact problem. They specifically help you track how your brand shows up in Al-generated answers and alert you when something's off or missing.\n\nSeems like a good fit for what you're trying to solve since you mentioned wanting visibility into LLM mentions. Way more focused than the general SEO tools that are just bolting on Al features as an afterthought. As for the \"\"how do I get noticed\" question, it's less about pumping out blog posts and more about making sure your existing content is structured in a way that Al can cite confidently.\n\nThink FAQs, comparitive content, clear use cases, customer stories. Make it easy for the model to understand who you are and why you're relevent to specific queries. measuring success is tricky right now since there's no PageRank equivalent yet, but tracking share of voice in Al responses is probably the closest analog.",

If ChatGPT or Perplexity doesn't mention your brand, you're losing traffic.\n\nMy team looked at 1,000 pages ranking for high-intent keywords like \"pricing,\" \"vs,\" and \"alternatives.\" We found a clear pattern for winning AI citations. [Here's data proof](https://youtu.be/ZvpNEPWVzCI), the breakdown and how to automated.\n\n**Real people get the clicks.**\n\nAI bots crave trust. They're programmed to avoid making things up (well, they try not to anyways lol), so they look for verified experts. 72.4% of top-ranking pages have a clear author byline. Use Author Schema. It tells the bot exactly who wrote the piece and why they're qualified.\n\n**Feed the bot its favorite format.**\n\nLLMs love questions and answers. It's how they learn. Pages ranking for \"pricing\" terms use FAQ blocks twice as often as other sites. Don't hide your data in long paragraphs. Use FAQ Schema. This gives the AI a clean snippet to copy-paste into an answer.\n\n**Build a map.**\n\nA Table of Contents helps. It sounds simple. Yet, 27% of top \"Alternatives\" pages use them to organize complex data. This structure helps a crawler understand how your sections relate to each other. If the AI can't map your page, it won't summarize it.\n\n**The clock is ticking.**\n\nAI search tools prioritize recent data. Over 43% of winning \"Alternatives\" pages show a recently updated date. If your post looks old, the AI will skip it for a newer source. Update your timestamps.\n\n**Every intent has a fingerprint.**\n\nEach keyword type requires a different layout. \"Pricing\" pages need CTAs above the fold—89% of them do. \"Review\" pages need massive authority. The average one we studied has 93,000 backlinks. You can't use one template for every keyword and expect to win.\n\nStop optimizing for a list of blue links. Optimize for the context window. If you make it hard for the AI to find your data, it'll just cite your competitor.",

The post just had too much upvote history to move. \n\nThen we tried something different. What if we just made Reddit love us instead? Not shilling, but actually being helpful in subs related to their industry. We fired up our own tools to find the right subs and topics, and started posting like crazy-real answers to questions, solid advice, quick guides. For about a month, we put up 40-50 posts. \n\nOnly mentioned the client when it honestly made sense, maybe in a fifth of the posts. It was kind of nuts: \n\n* All our posts combined got over 700k reads \n* Four of them went to the top in their subs \n* The negative post got pushed to page 2 on Google after three weeks \n* Now, three of our Reddit posts are on the front page for their brand name \n\nAnd this part blew my mind: I was messing with ChatGPT last week to see what it \"knew\" about the company, and it was literally quoting our Reddit posts. So now even the AI picked up the new, accurate story. Their conversion rate for branded traffic tripled in two months. \n\nHas anyone else had to battle old negative stuff that refused to die in search results? Would love to hear what worked for you (or if there are tricks we haven’t thought of yet).",

That keeps the signal high and avoids chasing karma.\n\nI’d start tagging DMs in a simple sheet (problem, budget, urgency, how they found you). After 20–30 of those, patterns jump out: phrases people repeat, trigger events, how they frame success. That’s gold for refining your offer and future replies.\n\nTool-wise, I’ve used F5bot and Mention for keyword alerts, and lately Pulse for Reddit on top to catch high-intent threads fast without camping in search all day.\n\nMain point again: dial in a tiny set of pains and show up consistently with real answers; the right leads find you.",

The companies I've seen actually generate pipeline from Reddit are engaging in 3-5+ relevant conversations every single day, which is where it becomes a real time sink.  \n  \nThe math works out though. Even in smaller B2B subreddits you've got maybe 10-15 solid opportunities daily during business hours. If you're leaving genuinely helpful comments with a subtle link where it makes sense, you're looking at 2-5% click-through rates.  \n  \nThat compounds to like 50-200 qualified visits monthly, and those convert way better than cold traffic because the person literally asked for help with teh exact problem you solve. The tricky part is most marketers try this for a few weeks, realize it's a grind, and either burn out or start cutting corners and get banned. Some companies just outsource the whole thing to a done-for-you service instead of trying to manage it in-house.  \n  \nI came across Community Mentions (https://communitymentions.com) recently and they basically handle the research, posting, and making sure you don't get flagged for self-promo. Makes sense for teams that don't have bandwidth to stay on top of Reddit daily but still want the organic visibility.",

That way you can see if your changes are even getting you mentioned before tanking more pages. For your current situation tho I'd probably roll back the changes and get your rankings back first, then test more incrementally instead of overhauling the whole thing at once.",

If you keep tightening the onboarding + showcasing real success stories (like “X app gained Y users after Z tests”), that could compound fast.\n\nCurious what % of users come back to test again vs one-and-done? That retention number is probably your real growth lever now.",

SEO is the rare channel that compounds, content you publish today keeps generating leads in month 6, month 12, month 24\n\nthe founders making this work are running it like a proper growth system:\n\nthey hunt low-competition, high-intent keywords from day one. not \"what is X\" vanity traffic — \"best X alternative\" and \"X pricing\" buying-intent stuff\n\nthey use AI to scale content production. yeah... \"AI content is bad\" but paired with real expertise it works. Claude, ChatGPT, whatever. programmatic SEO (pSEO) lets you rank for hundreds of long-tail keywords without writing each one manually — that's a growth hack in itself\n\nthey build free tools as link magnets. Bhanu Teja from India scaled his SaaS to **$13k MRR** using SEO + free tools. people share and link to useful free tools organically\n\nlinks → domain authority → rankings → inbound leads → revenue\n\n**the compounding math:**\n\n* month 1: almost nothing\n* month 6: a trickle\n* month 12: hundreds of qualified visitors/day with zero ongoing CAC\n\nthe CAC for a lead coming from a 12-month-old article is basically $0. that's a unit economics story that's hard to beat\n\nthe disadvantage is the feedback loop is slow. most growth teams optimize for speed and that's fair. but if you're early stage and don't have budget to outspend competitors on paid, this is the asymmetric bet\n\nyou're trading time upfront for a moat later. most of your competitors won't have the patience. that's the actual growth hack\n\nNico, [zignalify](https://zignalify.com) founder",

      "text": "For the past few months, I’ve been building my SaaS product completely solo. That means nights and weekends spent coding, marketing, and everything in between. No team, no virtual assistants, and no agencies, just me, my laptop, and plenty of coffee.\n\nThis past month felt like a real turning point for me. I got 2,150 organic visitors to my site, which led to 31 trial signups and ultimately 7 paying customers. That brought in $2,795 in revenue, which averages out to about $1.3 per visitor. And the best part is, I didn’t spend a single dollar on ads.\n\nSo, what made the difference? Let me walk you through the tools and strategies that really moved the needle.\n\nI used [Typedream](http://typedream.com/) to build my homepage and pricing pages quickly. It only took me about two hours, and everything was SEO-friendly and mobile responsive without any complicated coding or design headaches.\n\nFor backlink building, I relied on [GetMoreBacklinks.org](http://getmorebacklinks.org/). Manually submitting my website to hundreds of startup directories would have taken me around 20 hours, but with this tool, I did it in one click. My domain rating jumped from zero to six, and Google indexed my site in just four days, which gave me some crucial early momentum.\n\nTo support content marketing, I used [PostKit](http://postkit.pro/) to post two blog articles targeting keywords with low competition. One of those posts ranked in the top 30 search results within 10 days. I also kept a public changelog to show that the project is alive and active, which helped build trust and conversions.\n\nFor onboarding, I set up a simple five-step drip email sequence using [MailMaestro](https://www.maestrolabs.com/). I welcomed new users, shared helpful tips on features, highlighted testimonials, showcased a mini case study, and asked for feedback. This sequence played a big role in turning 31 trial users into paying customers.\n\nThe biggest lessons I learned are not to chase flashy tools but to pick simple, reliable ones that help you work without friction. Despite not being glamorous, directory backlinks are still effective. Slow and consistent growth beats flashy viral hacks. And most importantly, your goal should be revenue per visitor, not just traffic.\n\nIf you want, I’m happy to share email templates, blog outlines, and even the keywords I focused on. This month was my first time making real profit as a solo founder, and I’m finally starting to feel momentum.",

The $1.3 per visitor number is interesting because it highlights something most people overlook -- when you're not spending on ads, your traffic quality tends to be much higher because those visitors are finding you through intent-based searches.\n\n\n\nCouple things I'd add from similar experience:\n\n\n\nThe drip email sequence is doing more heavy lifting than most people realize. Seven paying customers from 31 trials is a 22% conversion rate, which is actually quite strong for SaaS. That tells me your onboarding emails are probably nailing the timing on when to showcase value vs when to ask for the upgrade. Would be curious what your email open rates look like across the sequence.\n\n\n\nOn the SEO side, the low competition keyword strategy is exactly right at this stage. Too many founders waste months trying to rank for competitive terms when there are hundreds of specific long-tail queries nobody is targeting. Two posts ranking in top 30 within 10 days is proof of that.\n\n\n\nOne thing I'd think about as you scale: the directory backlink approach works great for the initial authority boost, but it has diminishing returns. As you hit DA 10-15, you'll want to shift toward earning links from content partnerships and guest contributions on industry blogs. That's where the compounding really kicks in.",

I’d double down by:\n\n1) Tagging trial users by source (directory vs blog vs direct) so you can see which channel actually produces those 7 payers.\n\n2) Testing one small upgrade in the drip: a “day 2” email that asks a single question like “what were you hoping this would fix?” – I’ve seen that one reply turn into better onboarding and upsell ideas.\n\n3) Spinning your best-performing email into a short Reddit-style post and seeing if it pulls similar intent here.\n\nI’ve used F5bot and SparkToro for this kind of “find people already in motion” approach, and pairing those with something like Pulse has helped me catch and reply to threads where folks are describing the exact pain my product solves.\n\nMain thing: you’ve got a working engine now, so it’s about instrumenting it, not adding more shiny stuff.",

I felt really excited about it, but after 60 days, I had only gained 9 customers, of which just 4 were paid, while the others were using free editing tools.   \n  \nTo increase visibility, I started posting daily in subreddits and X communities, gaining some traction. I then decided to double down on my efforts and began working on search engine optimization (SEO).   \n  \nI developed a blogging agent using [chatgpt.com](http://chatgpt.com/) and [n8n.io](http://n8n.io/), which automatically uploads 2 blogs daily featuring top-quality content.    \n  \nFurthermore, I focused on building backlinks and improving visibility through a [directory submission tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org/). I created a variety of content, including FAQs, comparison pages, and use case examples.   \n  \nI also improved the website structure for better crawling by language models, utilizing a tool I found on X, though I can’t remember its name.   \n  \nDuring this period, I launched on Product Hunt, created social media accounts, and utilized [postbridge.com](http://postbridge.com/) for scheduling posts.   \n  \nMy ongoing efforts resulted in traffic increasing from 300 to 2,000 daily visitors. Now, I am focusing on improving conversion rates.\n\n",

Heatmaps, session recordings, and A/B tests on your landing pages can help, but it gets tricky to figure out what actually works in your space.\n\n\n\nOne proven approach is to study the full funnels of your competitors: see what ads they're running, where they're sending people, and how they move users from landing page to checkout. You can use [DataDripper](https://datadripper.ai) to map out those journeys end to end and spot conversion tricks or layouts you might be missing. Other tactics: try segmenting your signup flow for different traffic sources, test new CTAs above the fold, and experiment with social proof throughout the user journey.\n\n\n\nAlso, don't overlook triggered email or notification sequences for new signups, they can move the needle on free-to-paid conversions. Sometimes just offering a clear, time-limited bonus for paid users right after signup can bump things up. It's all about testing, learning, and iterating fast.",

If every answer conveniently points back to your product, people will check your profile and connect the dots fast.\n\nThe safer approach is to separate goals. Use Reddit first to learn, not grow. Join niche subs where your users hang out. Answer questions deeply without mentioning your startup at all. Share lessons, mistakes, industry insight. Build karma and history.\n\nWhen it is directly relevant, you can disclose clearly. Something like “I’m building in this space” and then give real value in the comment itself. No links unless explicitly allowed. No DMs. No funnels.\n\nAlso, Reddit is usually better for feedback than distribution. You might get sharper product insights than raw signups.

The trick is you need consistent presence without it looking like drive-by marketing, which is basically impossible to do yourself while also running a startup. Here's what actually works for B2B on Reddit: post 3-5 genuinely helpful comments per day in your niche subs (for you that's music production, audio engineering, maybe indie musician communities).\n\nDon't mention your product in 80% of them. Just be useful. The other 20% can include a subtle mention if it truly solves the exact problem someone posted about.\n\nThe key is volume and consistency, not one-off promotional hits. That said, a lot of B2B founders I've seen just hire a done-for-you service to handle this because it's time-intensive and risky. I came across Community Mentions (https://communitymentions.com) recently when researching this exact problem.\n\nThey basically find the conversations for you and handle the posting so you don't have to worry about account bans or looking spammy. Makes sense if you're already stretched thin as a COO. Other route is using a tool like GummySearch or Brandwatch to monitor keywords, then you handle teh engagement yourself.\n\nGives you more control but requires daily effort.",

Do that for a few weeks and you'll start to notice patterns in what people need.\n\nWhen you eventually do mention your product, the framing matters. \"I built something that does this\" lands completely differently than \"check out our tool.\" One sounds like a person, the other sounds like a brand account. And make sure it's maybe 1 out of every \\~10-15 comments.\n\nBut really, with 1,100 signups and no PMF, I'd spend the time talking to your existing users instead.

          "text": "You nailed the main problem. Most people either over-promote and get banned, or try to avoid any kind of explicit promotion and don't get any real traction.  \n  \nI've been growing on Reddit consistently over the past year, and here are the only 3 repeatable ways I've used to keep getting traction on Reddit:  \n  \n1) Create posts - this one is obvious, and most founders default to this one, but it's very easy to get wrong. You need create posts that BRING VALUE first (unique insight, sharing your journey, what worked, what didn't, etc.) and only then mention your product. If your post lacks in any real value, it will be obvious that you've only created it to promote. Products that solve real problems are a good fit for creating posts since your value prop directly brings value to readers. Products that are fun and don't bring value might not be an ideal fit for CONSISTENTLY getting traction from posting.  \n  \n2) Comment on existing posts where people either explicitly ask for tool suggestions or describe problems your product solves - founders don't usually make the most out of this method, but this can bring crazy traffic too. The reason is because Reddit posts rank on Google, so lots of people can come upon your comment and then check out your product. The strategy here is the same, BRING VALUE first. Only then mention your product since it ties directly to what they're asking. Most founders don't use this strategy consistently because searching for new high-intent posts is time-consuming, but there are tools now that help with this.  \n  \n3) DM leads that showed interest in your product - this one is the most underrated, but it's also quite powerful, especially if you're early stage since this allows you to actually talk 1:1 with your target audience, ask questions, get feedback and iterate on your product. Also DMs can bring you traffic immediately (you DM, they get back to you in \\~1 day), while replying to posts is more of a long-term, compounding game.  \n  \nThese are pretty much the only strategies you need to grow on Reddit. It's not flashy, and it's not immediate. It's an every day commitment to show up and do this consistently. And it's really hard to show up everyday, but there are tools that can help you create a system, and I highly recommend you use one like Bazzly if you're serious about growing on Reddit.\n\nTLDR: Don't pitch, bring value.",

Think: “here’s the pain that pushed me to build this,” “here’s what almost killed it,” “here’s the one moment I almost quit.” Then I reuse the same core story across channels but tune the angle: more emotional on LinkedIn, more tactical on Reddit, more data-driven in email. That way it still feels human but not like I’m trauma-dumping for clicks.\n\n\n\nTactically, two things moved the needle: 1) a small DM list of “day-one champions” I’d helped before launch, with clear asks and assets; 2) jumping into every live convo that mentioned our problem space instead of screaming into the void. I’ve used things like SparkToro and manual Twitter/X searches for that, and lately tools like PhantomBuster and Pulse for Reddit help surface the handful of threads actually worth showing up in.\n\n\n\nSo yeah: lead with a real story, then systemize how you place it in front of the right conversations.",

Would love to share my lessons/tips if they can give anyone a head start.\n\nSome of this was obvious, a lot less so.\n\n**Offer**\n\nFriction is the death - reduce as much as possible. Dont as for people time - give them value. Something like \"Here's a free tool that solves your exact problem. Reply 'yes' and I'll send you the signup link\"\n\n**Warm-Up**\n\nBuy 6-10 separate domains just for outreach. Use variations of your brand. Warm them up on Instantly (keep this simple) - for more scale run 2 separate infrastructure sets, odd set and even set - they send on alternate days- but each has the ability to take on the full load if needed.\n\nWithout good deliverability - all the other effort goes to zero\n\n**Data**\n\nYou need good data and a lot of it.\n\nA. Export large set of filtered data from data source (e.g. Pitchbook, Crunchbase)  \nB. Identify key decision makers via Apollo  \nC. Cleanse email data with Reoon\n\nThen scrape each website and give it to ai to check ICP fit for the company and your offering - more than 10% of companies in your list will be mis-tagged by Apollo - it's important to weed them out at this stage to better deliverability and PMF. You can use clay here.\n\n**Some Quirks**\n\nThese are not make or break, rather they are all good to have - \n\nPlain text only. No HTML, no images, no fancy formatting.\n\nUse spintax for variety: {Hey|Hi|Hello} {{first\\_name}},\n\nTesting insight: Subject lines matter way less than you think for cold email, the first line matters 10x more.\n\nOnly metrics that matter - +ve reply rate and Inbox delivery rate\n\n**Start small.

In my research on the **'Retrieval Loop,'** I’ve found that over 10% of entities are 'misunderstood' by automated databases (like Apollo) because their **Summary Integrity** has collapsed. By using AI to check the *actual* site content vs. the database tag, you’re essentially performing a manual **'Entity Triangulation'** before hitting 'send.' This is why your deliverability stays high—the relevance is mathematically solid.\n\nAlso, your 'Plain Text' rule is a great nudge toward **Asymmetric Firmness**. AI-driven inbox filters are becoming as sophisticated as LLM search engines; they’re trained to sniff out 'marketing posture' (HTML/images). Factual, boring, declarative text isn't just a choice—it’s a survival strategy to stay out of the 'Spam/Ignored' bucket.\n\n**Quick question on the 'Mis-tagged' data:** When the AI flags a company as a bad fit despite the database saying otherwise, is it usually because of **'Adjective Creep'** (the company uses vague language on their site) or just outdated 'dark data' in the source?\n\nAppreciate the 500k-scale reality check!",

Same script, different angle, reply rates jump.\n\n\n\nAlso worth building a ruthless disqualification loop: if a segment underperforms after 2–3 micro-tests, kill it and re-route volume instead of “fixing” copy forever.\n\n\n\nFor finding fresh pockets of pain to turn into offers, I’ve used Clay plus LinkedIn Sales Nav, and lately tools like PhantomBuster; Pulse for Reddit is handy for surfacing threads where target buyers are already ranting about the exact problem you’re solving, which makes the “here’s a free tool” angle land way harder.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, ops + data discipline beats clever writing here.",

In most cases you will actually want to avoid discounting because it attracts lower quality customers.\n\nThe second approach is a key differentiator.\n\nOur platform repurposes content into 13 social media platforms automatically. Something none of our competitors do.\n\nWhen your product solves a massive pain point like that, your ad becomes an easy sell.\n\nWhile we use programmatic SEO and YouTube influencers, Meta ads are our main engine.\n\nBut I see people overcomplicating them every day.\n\nHere is my exact setup.\n\nFirst, get your tracking right.\n\nYou need the Conversion API setup with a score of at least 6 out of 10.\n\nOptimize for the Subscription Paid event so Facebook finds actual buyers.\n\nSecond, stop messing with targeting.\n\nYour creative is your targeting.\n\nThe algorithm is smart enough to find your people if your ad speaks to them.\n\nI target broad.\n\nI start with the US and Tier A countries like the UK, Australia and Canada.\n\nI run only two campaigns.\n\nOne main campaign for cold traffic and one retargeting campaign to address specific objections.\n\nThe best ads for us are UGC style, 15 to 30 seconds max.\n\nThe hook is everything.\n\nI use AI tools to iterate on the hooks and reuse the core video.\n\nIf you have a winning ad just change the first 3 seconds.\n\nI have upsells in place like a $299 plan for higher service levels.\n\nEnough people take the upsell to cover the cost of the ads.\n\nYou need to know your numbers.\n\nI track everything in a spreadsheet: CPM, CPC, conversion rates, and churn.\n\nThis gives me the confidence to spend money because I know exactly when I will make it back.\n\nMost founders focus on the product and treat marketing as an afterthought.\n\nI think the offer and the funnel are king.\n\nFix the offer and the ads will work.\n\nCheers,  \nBorja from [rebelgrowth.com](http://rebelgrowth.com/?utm_source=reddit)\n\nP.s. if you need help figuring out a good offer or differentiating angle drop your project and I'll do my best to give some ideas",

I'd start by just tracking whether your content shows up in AI overviews manually, and use something like Semrush or Ahrefs (which you probably already have) to monitor featured snippet performance since there's a lot of overlap.

      "text": "Influencers are still one of the most efficient ways to grow your customer base.\n\nHowever, they’re expensive. An average YouTuber with 10,000 subscribers may ask for up to $500 per mention, depending on the niche and their level of trust with their audience.\n\nWhat they usually don’t tell you is that most influencer deals turn out to be bad investments. In my experience, around 60% generate no meaningful revenue, 20% hover around break-even, and only 20% actually make you money.\n\nAt the time, we were doing around $15k in net profit per month, so we obviously couldn’t shell out tens of thousands of dollars just to watch most of it disappear.\n\nThe only viable option was to offer a generous cut of the profit they generated. The problem? Influencers hate this with a passion. Most of them want a fixed fee upfront, paid immediately after the mention, which makes total sense on their end. \n\nHere’s what I did to close them anyway and eventually generate over $400,000 in monthly recurring revenue:\n\n1. I eliminated all YouTubers who worked with talent agencies. They will not, under any circumstances, accept a 100% commission deal. I focused only on independent creators.  \n2. I targeted small YouTubers, ideally those who hadn’t yet done integrated ads. They’re usually excited that someone wants to partner with them and tend to be more flexible. Smaller communities are also tighter-knit. Viewers interact directly with the creator through comments, Reddit, livestreams, or Discord. That increases trust significantly.  \n3. During negotiations, I clearly explained the risks on our side and gradually reframed why a fixed-fee model didn’t make sense initially.  \n4. I suggested a trial. Typically, they would upload one to three integrations, and then we’d evaluate the results together before discussing a longer-term partnership.  \n5. If the results were strong, a fixed fee became feasible. If someone is generating $40,000 per month in revenue for you, paying them $2,000 fixed is completely reasonable, especially if the relationship is solid.  \n6. Tracking is crucial. Since our product was an app and building a full referral system wasn’t a priority at first, we launched Creator Codes with uncapped, lifetime commissions. Referring a customer once and earning from them indefinitely sounds attractive, even if some users forget to enter the code.  \n7. Beyond commission, we added extra value wherever possible. For example, we offered website design help or business advice. With each creator, we looked for something additional we could include to move them toward a yes. There’s almost always something you can bundle.  \n\nThe best part about strong small YouTubers is that they grow. Many go from 10k to 100k subscribers relatively quickly. That gave us exposure we would have had to pay a massive amount for through other channels.\n\nOver time, the numbers compounded. Even though we were giving away 40% of the profits, it was still worth it because it allowed us to scale.\n\nIf you haven’t tested this approach yet and your ideal customers spend time on YouTube, I highly recommend experimenting with it.\n\n",

That's why I'm focusing on social media. Specifically, I use a lot of cookbooks, recipe files, and Excel spreadsheets, etc., on openai. I get ideas and prompts from there for Sora, who takes the photos. I use a carousel of 6-8 photos (I tried videos, but I'm not very good at it, haha). And that's it. Basically, openai and Sora2",

I've seen a lot of sites get hit recently for relying too heavily on AI, even if it's \"humanized.\" Google seems to be getting better at detecting it.\n\nThe heavy internal linking is interesting. +30 per page is a lot. Make sure they're contextually relevant and not just stuffed in there, that can also trigger a penalty. I'd experiment with dialing that back to see if it impacts indexing or rankings.",
