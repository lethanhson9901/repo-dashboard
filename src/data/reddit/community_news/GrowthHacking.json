      "text": "If you want to scale your marketing with influencers but dont want to burn cash on bad deals, get scammed by fake bot views, or waste months listening to \"gurus\" who have never actually booked a sponsorship... then you might enjoy this.\n\nI work as a Marketing Director for a pretty big brand and I also run my own SaaS on the side. \n\nBetween the two, I've hired over a thousand influencers and spent millions in partnership dollars.\n\nHere is the brain dump on what actually works:\n\nYouTube longform first until you max out on youtube longform, dont do any other format. \n\nNothing beats the power of the attention spam and the direct CTA with link in description as longform does. \n\nIgnore all the gurus telling you to hire one million micro influencers on TikTok, even if you’re target audience is on TikTok/Reels, I guarantee there are also channels on youtube with longform videos for that same audience, dont waste your time don’t lose your sanity, do longform until there’s none else to partner with on that format.\n\nYou need to have a solid proven offer before you try influencers. Have scarcity in the CTA, like “First 1,000 people to click the link get this special offer”\n\nTest 60 second integrations vs fully dedicated videos (more expensive). Have them put the 60 second promo in the first 5 minutes of the video to maximize eyeballs on your offer.\n\nBeware of scammers, several channels inflate their views and engagement with bots, look for suspiciously consistent high views across all videos, look for repeated and sometimes identical comments praising the influencer, too many emojis, and celebrities in the profile pictures even.\n\nIf you’re a startup strap for cash, you will want to push for commission only deals, for my startup Rebelgrowth, that’s 30% on every generated subscription for life, but in my experience most influencers don’t like performance deals even when they would be making more money in the long term, they dont know this so its your job to explain the math on why this is the case, make a simple spreadsheet, make a loom video, praise their last video, explain why you think your startup would be a great fit and explain why the commission offer is better than flat rate.\n\nHowever, if you’re an established startup/company with a budget, you’ll want to do flat rate deals because YOU will make more money in the long term as opposed to having to pay 30% of your revenue forever.\n\n30% of deals will succeed, those are the channels you will want to nurture and repeat and that will carry the whole effort, another reason why you need to stay away from flat rate as a bootstrapped startup, you can’ afford to have your first 10 deals fail looking for the 3 that will work. This is a numbers game.\n\nWhat I look for in a channel (this is less important when doing performance deals): Audience affinity; how relevant is the topic to your business, what are audience demographics (age, location, genre), how consistent are views across the last 12 videos, how often does the channel publish, what’s the engagement rate (high engagement = high conversions), I can afford more on a channel with 7,000 views but 15% engagement rate than a channel with 10,000 views but 5% engagement rate. Engagement is comments to subs (or views) rate.\n\nOn flat rates, always negotiate down aggressively, argue why with the channels using your analysis from the above paragraph. I personally look for sub $50 CPMs when doing flat rate (irrelevant when doing commission deals).\n\nTo find channels, ask your favorite AI chat to do “Deep Research” and find the top 100 channels that meet your preferred criteria. If doing commissions, aim for small channels to improve your chances of getting a “yes”, so channels with under 10k subs. You can also simply search youtube, or one of the millions of apps out there that have a youtubers database. Gather the list and then it's time to find the emails. I pay a guy on upwork $50 per 100 researched channels because youtube only lets you unlock 5 emails per day. This guy has a bunch of accounts he uses to unlock emails quicker.\n\nOnce you have the emails, use your favorite outreach tool to schedule 4 - 7 emails (the money is in the followups). Keep it simple, lead with “Paid sponsorhip?...” in the subject and first line of email copy so the influencer knows you’re down to business.\n\nHave dedicated landing pages per influencer or dedicated coupon codes or if you’re doing affiliate commissions it doesn’t really matter since they will have their affiliate link to your product anyways.\n\nYou’ll want to stay compliant if you’re a big company, which means making sure the influencer clearly discloses its a sponsorship when the Ad begins, have them put your logo as soon as they say the video is sponsored by your company.\n\nCheers,  \nBorja",

The “max out longform before you touch other formats” rule lines up with what I’ve seen: one solid 60–90s mid-roll with a tight CTA in the first 5 minutes can beat a whole swarm of scattered shorts.\n\nOne thing I’d add is to track creator-level LTV, not just ROAS on the first campaign. The 30% of channels that work usually keep working if you treat them like a true sales channel: share conversion data back with them, test new hooks together, let them see which angles land.\n\nFor discovery, I’ve used things like Grin and Upfluence plus AI helpers like Pulse for Reddit to surface niche communities and talking points before I ever reach out, so the pitch feels way more “I get your audience” and way less copy-paste. This is all a volume game, but the compounding effect of a small stable of proven creators is where the real upside lives.",

One thing I would add from the agency side is that the format matters less once creators stop being treated only as distribution.\n\nI work in growth at Darkroom, and a big shift we see is using creators as performance inputs, not just influencer placements. We run creator programs where UGC is produced specifically for paid media, TikTok Shop, and social commerce, not just posted once on a channel and forgotten. The same creator video can live as a YouTube integration, a TikTok Spark Ad, a Shop PDP asset, and a retargeting unit. That changes the math entirely.\n\nThis is why our work at Darkroom ends up sitting between influencer, creative, and paid media. We help brands build creator programs that are designed for scale, not one off posts. That includes sourcing and managing creators, producing UGC that is optimized for performance, integrating it into paid media and TikTok Shop flows, and using AI systems to speed up testing without removing human judgment. It does not feel like influencer marketing when it is done right. It feels like a growth engine that compounds over time.\n\nYouTube longform is still powerful for direct response, agreed. But TikTok creators become extremely valuable when they are paired with a strong offer, fast iteration, and paid amplification. That is where AI actually helps. We use it to scale creator sourcing, test hooks, and analyze which creators convert, but humans still decide who to double down on and why.\n\nThe biggest mistake brands make is thinking influencer marketing is about reach. The brands that win treat it like a performance channel with creative systems, repeatable creators, and tight feedback loops. Whether that starts on YouTube, TikTok Shop, or UGC for ads depends on the business model, not the trend.",

And I still don't know if I'm reaching out to the right people.\n\nSomeone told me about AI tools like Starnus that can automate this research part. Has anyone used something like that for investor outreach?\n\nOr are you all just grinding through the manual research? What's working for you?",

We built it for sales/outbound automation, but you're right that the same mechanics work for investor research we dound our Angel investors like this.\n\nThe platform finds and enriches leads based on your criteria, personalizes outreach, and tracks responses. If you're treating investors as \"leads,\" the workflow is basically the same: define your ICP (stage, sector, check size) then find matching VCs and then personalized outreach.\n\nWe haven't marketed it for fundraising, but a few users have mentioned doing this. The signal-based research and enrichment part translates pretty well.\n\nHappy to answer questions if you go this route. Good luck with your raise!",

      "text": "\nEveryone wants the viral growth hack that 10x's their traffic overnight. Tried all the sexy tactics first. Product Hunt launch, viral Twitter threads, Reddit posting, influencer outreach. Got some spikes but nothing sustainable. The problem with sexy growth hacks is they produce one-time results. You get a spike, then you're back to grinding for the next spike. I needed something that would compound week over week without constant effort. Switched to the unsexy approach that most growth hackers skip because it's boring. Built SEO foundation through directory submissions and consistent content. Used [backlink agency to handle 200+ directory submissions](http://getmorebacklinks.org) in week one while I focused on finding actual growth levers.\n\nWeek one through three looked like nothing was happening. Directory listings went live slowly and traffic stayed flat around 50 visitors. This is why most growth hackers abandon SEO, no immediate dopamine hit like a viral post provides. Week four is when the compound effect started. Domain authority moved from zero to 16. A few blog posts started appearing on page two for longtail keywords. Traffic hit 180 visitors, small but growing consistently without any new effort from me.\n\nWeek five through eight the growth accelerated. Domain authority reached 22 and traffic climbed to 850 visitors. Published 6 blog posts total but the bigger factor was older content moving up in rankings as authority increased. Each post produced more value over time instead of spiking then dying. The growth rate is what changed my thinking. Viral tactics gave me 500 visitors one day then 20 the next. SEO foundation gave me 120 visitors week one, 180 week two, 340 week three. The trajectory was predictable and sustainable. Now eight weeks in and traffic keeps climbing without me chasing new growth hacks. The foundation work compounds while I focus on product and conversion optimization. The visitors coming through organic search convert better too because they have real intent.\n\nThe growth hacking lesson is that boring systematic work beats clever one-time tactics. Directory submissions and content creation aren't exciting to talk about but they produce predictable compounding growth. Viral moments are lottery tickets, foundation work is compound interest. If you're burned out chasing growth hacks that produce temporary spikes, try building something that compounds. It's slower to start but way less exhausting than constantly hunting for the next viral moment.",

You hit a Product Hunt feature or get lucky with a Reddit post, celebrate the traffic bump, then wake up three days later back at baseline wondering what to do next. It's like running on a treadmill where the speed keeps resetting.\n\nWhat shifted things for me was treating growth like infrastructure instead of events. SEO foundation work, consistent publishing, and actual optimization of what was already working. Boring, yes. But predictable.\n\nOne thing that helped me bridge the gap between content and conversions was using Thrive Leads to capture visitors once the traffic started building. SEO brings people in, but if you're not capturing emails or pushing them toward action, you're leaving a ton on the table. I set up targeted opt-in forms based on which posts people were reading, and that turned organic traffic into an actual asset instead of just a number in analytics.\n\nThe compounding effect you're describing is real, but only if you're also compounding the value of each visitor. Traffic that disappears without converting is just a vanity metric. Pairing SEO with lead capture and nurture made the foundation work actually produce revenue, not just charts that go up.",

Directories, templates, newsletters, courses, blogs, boilerplates, services, micro SaaS, and communities. Only 2 consistently made money without burning out. The rest either took too long or had terrible margins. Tested curated directories first after seeing Cyberleads make $500K annually and Theresanaiforthat monetize through listing fees. Built 3 directories in different niches. Revenue after 6 months was $340 total. The problem is everyone can copy your curation in hours. No moat. Listings dried up fast.

Canva and Notion's built-in galleries made discovery impossible. Template marketplaces are saturated. Unless you have massive audience, templates don't work anymore.​ Started newsletter thinking I'd get sponsorships like others making $2K monthly. Grew to 2,400 subscribers over 8 months. Got zero sponsorship offers. Realized you need 10K+ subscribers minimum for brands to care. Quit because effort-to-revenue ratio was terrible.​ Built online course because Max Haining runs successful ones. Spent 6 weeks creating content. Sold 8 copies for $1,120 total. Course creation takes forever and selling requires huge audience or paid ads budget I didn't have. Not viable for bootstrappers starting from zero.​\n\nWhat actually worked was micro SaaS and productized services. Built simple micro SaaS solving specific problem using boilerplate from FounderToolkit in 4 weeks. Hit $4,200 monthly revenue by month 3. Launched productized design service at fixed $2,500 per project. Booked 5 projects in 2 months making $12,500. Both had clear value propositions and customers willing to pay immediately.​ [Studied patterns in FounderToolkit database comparing 1,000+ builders across these product types](http://foundertoolkit.org). Micro SaaS and productized services had highest success rates for solo builders because they solve immediate painful problems, customers pay real money upfront, margins stay high, and moats exist through execution quality. Directories and templates are races to the bottom.​\n\nThe controversial truth is most product types work only if you already have audience. Micro SaaS and services work even starting from zero because you're selling solutions, not attention. Build products that solve problems customers pay for today, not products hoping for traffic someday.​\n\nStop copying product types that work for influencers with 50K followers. Build what works for solo builders with zero audience.\n\nWhat product type are you building? Does it actually work without existing audience?",

      "text": "Launched our startup in Amsterdam three months ago with typical EU bootstrap constraints. Small budget, no funding yet, competing against established players with years of SEO investment. Had maybe €500 total for marketing in Q1. Couldn't afford paid ads at European CPCs. Couldn't hire an agency at €2K+ monthly retainers. Needed a growth channel that would work on a tiny budget and compound over time instead of requiring constant spend. Put €100 into SEO foundation as the only realistic option. Used [directory submission tool to establish domain authority through directory submissions](http://getmorebacklinks.org) across EU and country-specific business directories. This was the cheapest way to build baseline trust without months of manual outreach. Then created 12 blog posts targeting problem-based searches in English and our local market language. Not promotional content but actual answers to questions our target customers were searching for. Things like \"how to solve X in Netherlands\" or \"best way to handle Y for EU businesses.\"\n\nMonth one looked discouraging. Directory listings went live slowly and no traffic appeared. This is the scary part of bootstrapping because you're watching your entire budget produce zero visible results while competitors are running ads. Month two is when things shifted. Domain authority moved from zero to 19. A few blog posts started appearing on page two for longtail keywords. Got our first 8 customers from organic search without spending another euro on acquisition.\n\nMonth three hit 700 organic visitors and 22 total customers from search. The €100 investment created a channel that keeps producing without ongoing spend. Compare that to paid ads where €100 might get 30 clicks that disappear immediately. The unit economics work completely differently. Customer acquisition cost from organic is basically zero after initial setup. Lifetime value is higher too because they found us through research instead of being interrupted by ads they didn't trust. Now four months in and organic is the primary growth channel. Still bootstrapped and lean but the SEO foundation means new content gets discovered without paid promotion. The budget constraint forced us into a channel with better long-term economics.\n\nThe EU startup lesson is you can't out-spend competitors but you can out-patience them. Work on channels that compound even if they're slower to start. When bootstrapping in Europe, optimize for leverage over immediate gratification.",

Directories and templates are races to the bottom.​\n\nThe controversial truth is most product types work only if you already have audience. Micro SaaS and services work even starting from zero because you're selling solutions, not attention. Build products that solve problems customers pay for today, not products hoping for traffic someday.​\n\nStop copying product types that work for influencers with 50K followers. Build what works for solo builders with zero audience.\n\nWhat product type are you building? Does it actually work without existing audience?",

      "text": "I came across this breakdown and it completely flipped how I thought about YouTube. Figured it might be valuable for you as well.\n\nMost founders assume YouTube only works if you go big. Massive subscriber counts, viral videos, influencer-level reach. But this case study proves that's wrong, well at least for B2B.\n\nThere's a small company in immigration + tax optimization. Nothing sexy. Their average client pays around $2,000 though. Their YouTube channel has maybe 1,000 to 1,500 subscribers. And from that channel alone, they've booked 500+ sales calls. That's easily seven figures in revenue from what most people would call a \"dead\" channel.\n\nBut it gets crazier… They get only around 350 to 400 views per day. About 30 videos total. But they close roughly half their calls. They even spun up a second channel in another language with under 30 subscribers, and it already brought in multiple paying clients.\n\nThis is why B2B YouTube is a completely different game.\n\nSubscriber count is a vanity metric. What actually matters:\n\n* Who's watching: are they decision-makers or random browsers?\n* Why they're watching: are they actively looking for a solution?\n* How much one customer is worth: if a client pays $2k, $10k, or more, you don't need scale\n\nThe videos that drive revenue on this channel aren't flashy. They're boring, high-intent, search-driven stuff: \"how to get residency in X,\" \"best tax residency for digital nomads,\" country comparisons etc. These aren't entertainment videos. They're decision-stage videos, which means the viewer is already problem-aware and actively searching for a solution. That's why they convert.\n\nIf you're selling something where one customer is worth a few thousand dollars or more, obsessing over subscriber count makes no sense. A small channel with the right topics can outperform a larger audience watching for entertainment. The leverage comes from intent, not scale.\n\nI’d love to hear form other founders to see if you’ve had similar results? Have any of you tried YouTube as an acquisition channel? What results did you see?",

Thought I’d share a quick, practical list so you can audit your outreach and start getting better results.\n\nSharing a condensed version here so it’s easy to audit your own outreach:\n\n* Targeting the wrong accounts On paper they fit the ICP. In reality, they had no real reason to care.\n* Not segmenting within the ICP A 20-person SaaS and a 200-person company shouldn’t get the same message, even if they buy the same product.\n* Ignoring buyer personas Sending identical outreach to a CEO, a technical decision-maker, and an end user almost always backfires.\n* Generic messaging No context, no relevance. Recent events, tech stack, or actual KPIs make a huge difference.\n* Relying on one channel Cold email alone rarely carries the whole load. LinkedIn and light calls help more than people expect.\n* Volume over fit More messages didn’t help. Better-targeted ones did.\n* Letting the ICP go stale Markets shift. Teams change. If your ICP hasn’t been revisited in a year, it’s probably wrong.\n* Pitching too early Pushing a solution before the buyer recognises the problem kills otherwise good outreach.\n\nOutbound still works, but only when execution is smart and relevant. Let me know which of these you’ve seen most in your own outreach or what fixes helped you the most!",

      "text": "Ten months of daily posting. 300 videos. Every single one stuck between 200 and 400 views. Not one breakthrough. Not one that performed differently. Just the same dead result 300 times in a row.\n\nI'm completely burned out. Ten months of consistent effort and I'm still in the exact same place I started. Started thinking maybe I'm just fundamentally not cut out for content creation.\n\nWhat's destroying me is not understanding what's wrong. I watch my videos and they look fine. I watch successful creators and mine doesn't look drastically worse. But they're hitting 50k and I'm dying at 300 and I cannot see the difference.\n\nStarted thinking maybe the algorithm hates my account. Maybe I'm shadowbanned. Maybe I need to delete everything and start fresh because this account is clearly broken.\n\nTried changing everything over ten months. Different topics. Different formats. Different niches. Different editing styles. Nothing broke the pattern. Still 300 views regardless of what I changed.\n\nTen months of daily content with zero breakthrough and I couldn't identify what was actually killing me. Finally figured it out two weeks ago and everything changed. Now averaging 21k views. Here's what I learned.\n\n**300 failures means one pattern repeated 300 times not 300 different mistakes.** You have an execution issue you keep repeating because you can't see it. Mine was pausing for 2 seconds at second 9 in every video. That's one problem done 300 times. Find your one repeating pattern.\n\n**The algorithm isn't suppressing you your execution pattern is creating suppression-level results.** The algorithm would push your content if people watched it. People don't watch because something specific you're doing makes them leave. Fix that thing and distribution comes back immediately. You're not shadowbanned. Your execution is broken.\n\n**What you're repeating feels invisible because it's your natural creation rhythm.** Those 2 second pauses were just how I naturally spoke. My cadence. I couldn't see them as problems because they felt like me. To viewers they felt like the video stopping or dead air. That's your blind spot. What feels natural to you reads as broken to viewers.\n\n**Changing topics or styles doesn't fix execution timing issues.** I spent ten months changing content strategy when I needed to fix content execution. My topics were fine. My pause timing was broken. Changing topics 50 times didn't fix pause length. I was solving the wrong layer of the problem.\n\n**This is what finally broke me out after ten months and 300 failures.** I found [this app](https://taap.it/3WSYvTJ) and it showed me what I couldn't see for ten months. It analyzes your videos and tells you what's broken at exact timestamps with specific fixes. Second 9 pause 2.0 seconds visual static people left cut to under 1 second add movement. That diagnostic precision is what changed everything after ten months of guessing. Regular analytics showed retention dropping. It showed me the 2 second pause was why and exactly how to fix it. That's when I went from 300 views to 21k overnight.\n\n**One micro-execution fix can undo ten months of plateau.** Cut my pauses to under 1 second. Everything else stayed identical. Same topics. Same style. Just fixed the pause timing. Breakthrough happened immediately. Those 300 failures weren't wasted. They taught me everything except the one broken thing. Fixed that and everything clicked.\n\nLast 9 videos all over 19k. Same person who failed 300 times over ten months. Just stopped repeating the execution flaw I was blind to.\n\nIf you've been stuck for months with hundreds of failed videos you have one execution blind spot. Find it and everything shatters.",

      "text": "I've been in growth for 8 years, and I just realized something that should be obvious but isn't: we've been solving the wrong problem.\n\nEveryone talks about driving more traffic. More ads, more content, more channels. But the real bottleneck isn't traffic, it's intent. You can drive 10,000 visitors to a landing page and get a 1% conversion rate. Or you can build something that makes people want to give you their email.\n\nHere's what changed my perspective: free tools convert 5-10x better than landing pages.\n\nI'm not talking about lead magnets (PDFs, guides, etc.). I'm talking about actual tools that solve a real problem and deliver value before asking for anything.\n\n# The Problem with Static Landing Pages\n\nLet's be honest. A landing page is a promise. \"Use our product and you'll get X result.\" But people don't trust promises anymore. They trust proof.\n\nWhen you land on a page that says \"We'll help you optimize your landing pages,\" you scroll. You're skeptical. You've heard it before.\n\nBut when you land on a page that says \"Enter your landing page URL and we'll audit it in 30 seconds,\" something shifts. You're not reading a pitch, you're experiencing the value.\n\nThat's the gap. And it's massive.\n\n# The Free Tool Framework\n\nThe pattern I've seen work repeatedly follows this sequence:\n\nValue → Proof → Data → Relationship\n\nYou start by delivering something useful immediately. No signup required. The user gets a report, a score breakdown, an action plan based on their data. Something tangible.\n\nThen, you gate the detailed results behind an email. Now you have a lead who has already experienced the value of what you do. They're not a cold email—they're a warm, intent-rich prospect.\n\nFinally, you have enriched data about them (what they searched for, what their results were, what problems they have). This becomes your sales conversation starter.\n\n# Two Case Studies That Prove This Works (which I built for clients)\n\nCase Study 1: ai-pact.com (Compliance Audit Tool)\n\nI built a tool for a compliance consulting firm that audits websites for regulatory risks. Users enter their business email, the tool scans their site, and delivers a report in 30 seconds.\n\nResults:\n\n•1,000+ leads generated in 3 months\n\n•20%+ conversion rate (vs. 1-3% on their landing page)\n\n•30+ daily organic views (the tool became a SEO asset)\n\nThe tool was so useful that people started sharing it. Organic growth kicked in. The firm didn't need to pay for traffic because the tool became the traffic driver.\n\nCase Study 2: GrowthTrack.ai (Performance Audit)\n\nAn agency built a tool that analyzes landing page speed, revenue and conversion potential. It's a simple input (URL) → output (performance score + recommendations).\n\nResults:\n\n•1,500+ leads in 6 months\n\n•25% conversion rate\n\n•$0 spent on marketing\n\nThe tool was so useful that it became their #1 lead source. They didn't build it to make money—they built it to prove their expertise and capture high-intent leads.\n\n# Why This Works (And Why Most Companies Don't Do It)\n\nThe reason this isn't more common is psychological. It feels risky to give away value for free. But here's the thing: you're not giving away your product. You're giving away a sample of your expertise.\n\nWhen someone uses your free tool and gets real value, they understand what you're capable of. They've experienced your thinking. They trust you more than any sales pitch could ever create.\n\nThe second reason is execution. Most companies think \"free tool\" and immediately think \"lead magnet.\" They build a calculator or a template. But those don't work because they don't deliver real value—they deliver information.\n\nA real tool delivers an outcome. It solves a problem. It gives you something you didn't have before.\n\n# The Mechanics\n\nHere's what makes a free tool work:\n\n1. It solves a real, specific problem. Not \"improve your marketing\" but \"find out if you're underfunding maintenance\" or \"see how your landing page compares to competitors.\"\n\n2. It delivers value immediately. No signup required to see results. The user gets something useful before you ask for anything.\n\n3. It captures enriched data. You're not just getting an email—you're getting behavioral data about what they care about, what their problems are, what their metrics look like and you can send that all into your CRM.\n\n4. It's built to be shared. If the tool is genuinely useful, people will share it. This becomes your organic growth engine.\n\n5. It creates a natural sales conversation. Once someone has used your tool and seen their results, they want to know \"what do I do about this?\" That's your sales opening.\n\n# The Growth Flywheel\n\nOnce you have a tool, you can distribute it through multiple channels:\n\n•Launch: Product Hunt, Hacker News, relevant communities\n\n•Owned: Your email list, your website, your blog\n\n•Earned: People share it because it's useful (organic growth)\n\n•Paid: Retargeting people who bounced on your site, stale leads, or paid ads to drive initial traffic\n\nThe beautiful part is that each channel feeds the others. Organic growth reduces your paid costs. Paid traffic increases organic reach. Your email list becomes a distribution channel.\n\n# The Math (Conservative Estimate)\n\nLet's say you build a tool that gets 100 visitors per month (very conservative for something useful).\n\n•Conversion rate: 20% (people who use it and give their email)\n\n•Leads per month: 20\n\n•Leads per year: 240\n\nNow, let's say 10% of those leads eventually become customers (also conservative for warm, intent-rich leads).\n\n•Customers per year: 24\n\nThat's 24 customers from a single tool. If your average deal is $10K, that's $240K in annual revenue. If your average deal is $50K, that's $1.2M.\n\nAnd this is from a single tool. Most companies could build 2-3 of these.\n\n# Why This Matters Right Now\n\nThe growth landscape has changed. Paid acquisition costs are up. Ad platforms are less effective. Organic reach is harder to come by.\n\nBut the one thing that hasn't changed is that people will engage with something that's genuinely useful. A free tool that solves a real problem is one of the few things that still breaks through the noise.\n\n# The Challenge\n\nHere's the challenge: building a free tool requires a different skillset than running ads or writing content. It requires product thinking. It requires understanding your customer's problem deeply enough to build a solution.\n\nBut if you can do it, the payoff is enormous. You're not just acquiring customers—you're building a permanent asset that generates leads on its own.\n\n# Final Thought\n\nThe best growth hacks aren't about finding a new channel or a clever tactic. They're about understanding what people actually want and giving it to them.\n\nA free tool that solves a real problem is the closest thing to a growth hack that actually works long-term.\n\nWhat free tools have you built or seen work?

Sending surveys later didn’t help much either since response rates were low and the context was gone.\n\nWhile digging into alternatives, I came across Mopinion and it made me reconsider real-time feedback. Asking a short question right when a user is about to leave or stalls on a key page sounds simple, but it could explain hesitation in a way metrics alone can’t.\n\nThat said, I’m always cautious about adding anything that might hurt conversions.\n\nFor those deep into CRO and experimentation, how are you uncovering the motivation behind user behavior?

Session replays + exit intent surveys (combo)\\*\\*\n\n\n\nI use session recordings to spot \\*where\\* the hesitation happens (cursor hovering, scroll rage, back-and-forth behavior), then trigger a micro-survey only at those specific friction points. Generic exit surveys get ignored; contextual ones don't.\n\n\n\nKey: Keep it to ONE question. \"What's stopping you from \\[specific action\\]?\" with 3-4 preset answers + \"Other.\"\n\n\n\n\\*\\*2. The \"almost converter\" segment\\*\\*\n\n\n\nPeople who got 80%+ through your funnel but didn't convert are gold. They wanted it enough to invest time. I'll sometimes reach out directly via email: \"Hey, noticed you got close to \\[action\\] - curious what held you back?\" Surprisingly high response rate, and the answers are brutally honest.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*3. Support ticket mining\\*\\*\n\n\n\nYour support team is sitting on a goldmine of \"why\" data. I built a simple tagging system for support tickets by funnel stage. After 30 days, patterns emerge: \"People at checkout consistently ask about X\" = obvious fix.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*4. Fake door testing for feature validation\\*\\*\n\n\n\nIf I'm not sure \\*why\\* a feature isn't getting adoption, I'll create a \"coming soon\" version of a hypothetical improvement and see who clicks. High click rate = the current version is the problem. Low click rate = people don't care about that feature at all.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*On the Mopinion approach:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nIn-the-moment feedback is powerful but I've found the \\*timing\\* of the prompt matters more than the tool. Triggering on time-on-page or scroll depth alone misses context. Triggering on behavioral signals (rage clicks, form abandonment, etc.) gets much better signal.\n\n\n\nWhat type of funnel are you optimizing? B2B SaaS vs. e-commerce vs. content have pretty different \"why\" investigation playbooks.",

I stumbled onto SMB Sales Boost (https://smbsalesboost.com/) which gives you contacts for newly registered businesses.\n\nIt's basically a database of fresh SMB leads so you're reaching people who just started and are actively building their stack. The targeting becomes way tighter because you know they're in setup mode rather than just guessing based on job titles. Combining that kind of lifecycle timing with the intent signals you mentioned sounds like it would be pretty powerful.\n\nWay better than spray and pray for sure.",

The deliverability challenges are real as hell, but they're not unsolvable. Our clients who succeed with agencies picked ones that manage the full technical stack including domain rotation, proper warmup, and constant deliverability monitoring.\n\nThe fragility you're describing usually comes from rushing infrastructure or cutting corners on list quality. Agencies that know what they're doing don't burn domains every few weeks because they're not blasting shit data at maximum volume. They ramp slowly, verify everything, and target tightly so the campaigns actually perform without trashing sender reputation.\n\nDIY automation stacks can work too but you're taking on all the complexity yourself. Most growth focused founders waste more time troubleshooting deliverability than the agency cost would've been. The decision comes down to whether your time is better spent building product or managing email infrastructure. If cold email is a core channel for you, paying experts usually makes more sense than becoming an expert yourself while trying to run everything else.",

          "text": "If you’re starting from zero like I did with my own web services and early SaaS products, the first thing I learned was that user acquisition isn’t a magic channel, it’s a process you build slowly by learning about your users. You can read all the frameworks and funnels you want, but until you start talking directly to people who actually use or might use your product, you’re guessing. I’d start by having simple conversations with users or potential users, even if it’s just a few short calls or messages, asking what problem they’re trying to solve, what they expected when they signed up, and where they dropped off.\n\nOnce you have that insight, you can start experimenting with specific tactics rather than random popups or ads. Segmenting users based on what content they consume or behavior they show on your site helps tailor offers instead of treating everyone the same, and that often improves acquisition and retention. Growth isn’t just about traffic, it’s about turning people who interact with what you built into people who stick around and tell others about it. The sooner you validate your assumptions with real feedback, the faster you’ll see what actually works for your funnel.",

Start with one MMP (AppsFlyer or Adjust) and learn how postbacks work. That's the gap between running ads and doing UA. For IronSource, Mintegral, Unity Ads - those are mostly relevant for gaming apps with rewarded ads or offerwall monetization. Don't learn them unless your app is in that space. GTM in the UA context means: pick 2-3 channels, set up proper attribution, optimize toward one clear downstream event (not installs - something like purchase or Day 7 retention), and scale what works. Reforge has the best structured content on this if you want frameworks instead of random YouTube tutorials.",

The next step is turning that into a real “growth stack,” not just more channels.\n\nMain thing: learn measurement. Set up one simple funnel first: ad click → install → key action (signup, level 3, first payment). Use Firebase or AppsFlyer docs to understand how events/attribution work, then map your current FB + YouTube flow onto that.\n\nFor GTM, don’t overthink it. Take one app or web landing page and just track 3 events with tags: pageview, CTAclick, and signup\\_complete. Once you see them in GA4, it’ll click why everyone obsesses over tracking.\n\nOn UA networks (ironSource, Mintegral, Unity/Applovin), start by reading their playbooks on creative formats and event optimization. Run tiny tests, one variable at a time. I use Meta’s Ads Library and Sensor Tower for ideas; friends lean on Similarweb, and one uses Pulse alongside those to mine Reddit for real user language that turns into better hooks. Main point: build a basic analytics + event setup first, then spread into more networks off that foundation.",
