      "text": "Hated the idea of cold email. Felt spammy. Felt desperate. Avoided it for years because it seemed beneath what a \"real\" company should do. Then I ran out of other ideas and needed customers.\n\nWrote 50 personalized cold emails. Not templates. Actually researched each company and wrote something specific to them. Mentioned something from their website or recent news. Explained specifically why I thought we could help their situation. Took about 2 hours total for all 50 because I batched the research.Created a simple one-pager in Gamma that I could attach showing exactly what we do for companies like theirs.\n\n48 people didn't respond at all. Expected and fine. 2 people responded. Both turned into calls. Both turned into customers. One became a $29K annual contract. The other started at $8K and has expanded twice since then. Those 2 hours of writing cold emails generated more revenue than months of content marketing and social media combined. I was so worried about bothering people that I missed out on helping people who actually needed what we offered.\n\nCold email isn't spam if it's relevant and personalized and offers real value. Spam is irrelevant mass messaging. Taking time to understand someone's situation and explaining how you might help is just sales. And sales is how businesses grow. I still don't love doing it but I stopped pretending it's beneath me.\n\n  \n",

      "text": "Launched my SaaS in March last year after 4 months of building. Did the whole Product Hunt thing, got 127 upvotes which felt amazing, 34 signups, 2 people actually paid. Then just crickets for months. By August I had maybe 50 total users and was making $180/month, barely enough for my tool costs. Started thinking maybe the market just wasn't there.\n\nI was complaining about it in a Discord group and someone asked if I was doing any content marketing. I said no because I'm not a writer and didn't think anyone would care. They suggested I just answer questions in communities where my target users hang out, be helpful without pitching anything. Seemed pointless but I had nothing to lose.\n\nStarted spending 30 minutes most days just browsing r/freelance and r/solopreneurs looking for questions I could actually answer about the problem my tool solves, which is managing client projects. Wrote genuine helpful comments, shared what worked for me when I was freelancing, mentioned tools I'd used. Didn't mention my product for probably 3 weeks, just helped people. Got some upvotes, people DMing follow-up questions, felt good honestly.\n\nAfter a month of that, someone asked for tool recommendations and I mentioned mine along with two competitors, trying to be honest about when each makes sense. That post got some traction, had 6 signups that week from Reddit. That felt like progress. So I kept doing it, got more comfortable sharing my own experience. Started writing longer posts about specific problems like \"How I organize client feedback without losing my mind\" and people seemed to find them useful.\n\nAround month 4 of doing this consistently, something clicked. SEO started working, my helpful posts were ranking for random searches. Some weeks I'd get 15-20 signups without doing anything new. Built an email list of like 400 people just from those posts who wanted updates. Now 11 months later I'm at $5.6K MRR, most of it from organic search and community referrals. Still adding maybe 25-35 signups weekly. The approach came from reading case studies in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) about founders who grew through content, seeing their actual timelines which were months not weeks, their struggles with consistency, the fact that most of them almost quit before it started working. Made me realize patient consistency beats desperate promotion every time. Not sexy advice but it's what actually worked after launches and paid ads failed.",

      "text": "I've been trying to build a profitable one-person business for almost 4 years now. First three attempts completely failed, lost about $9K total between them and wasted probably 18 months of nights and weekends. Fourth attempt is working though, been running it for 16 months and currently making $6.8K monthly as the only person. First attempt was a task management app I built because I personally wanted it. Spent 5 months coding, launched it, got maybe 30 users total, zero revenue. Second was a Chrome extension for managing tabs, similar story. Third was a freelance marketplace specifically for designers, spent $3K on development, could never get enough supply or demand to make it work. Pattern was always the same, I built what I thought was cool without checking if anyone actually had that problem.\n\nFourth attempt started completely differently. I'm a content marketer at a SaaS company and kept hearing our sales team complain about tracking conversations across email, Slack, and LinkedIn. They'd lose context about prospects, forget what was discussed, waste time searching old messages. I asked 8 sales people at different companies if they had the same issue over coffee chats, 6 said yes and described almost identical problems. One was paying $80/month per person for a CRM they barely used just to track conversations.\n\nBuilt the simplest possible version in 3 weeks, just a Chrome extension that captures conversations from different tools and organizes them by contact. Showed it to those 6 people, 3 started using it immediately. Asked if they'd pay $25/month, two said yes, one said maybe $20. Set up Stripe, got my first $45 MRR in week 4. That felt more real than anything from my previous three products. Growth was slow but steady. Posted in sales communities on Reddit and LinkedIn just helping people with conversation tracking problems, mentioned my tool when relevant. Hit $800/month by month 4, $1.9K by month 8. Started writing blog posts about sales productivity in month 6, took until month 10 before those started bringing organic signups. Now at month 16 making $6.8K with 289 paying users, working maybe 10-12 hours per week on support and small updates.\n\nThe shift wasn't learning better technical skills, it was building something people were already complaining about instead of what I thought they might need. Found that insight reading successful solopreneur stories in [Founder Toolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) where everyone said the same thing, solve real problems you discover through conversations not shower thoughts. Took me three failures and 4 years to actually listen though.",

That’s basically a repeatable script: (1) list pains from your day job, (2) talk to 5–10 peers, (3) get them to rank pains and say what they’d cancel to pay for this, (4) build only the workflow they describe, nothing extra.\n\n\n\nThe other killer move is hanging out where the pain shows up (sales communities) and answering questions first, mentioning the product second. I’d add two things: track which community threads actually convert (simple UTM + spreadsheet), and double down on 1–2 tiny features that your power users mention in every call.\n\n\n\nFor anyone doing similar B2B stuff: I’ve used Notion and Zapier for quick workflows, and DreamFactory when I needed to slap a real API on top of messy databases without wasting weeks.\n\n\n\nSolving the loudest, already-proven problem with a boring, focused tool is the whole game here.",

      "text": "\nGrowth hacker tracking customer acquisition across all channels for 14 months. Started with standard growth playbook of paid ads, referral loops, and viral tactics. Realized compound SEO economics beat all the clever hacks. Sharing complete channel comparison with month-by-month CAC progression.​ Business context is workflow automation SaaS at $89/month pricing. Launched using typical growth hacking playbook. Referral program with incentives, product-led growth mechanics, paid ads for scale. After 6 months realized $487 blended CAC was unsustainable even with viral coefficients. Started investing in organic backlink foundation to fix economics.​\n\nMonths 1-6 was growth hack experimentation spending $31,200 acquiring 64 customers. Referral program added 12% uplift to signups. Viral mechanics worked but didn't compound. Product-led growth helped conversion but didn't solve top-of-funnel. Blended CAC was $487 per customer. At $89/month pricing that's 5.5-month payback with 9-month average LTV barely profitable.​\n\nMonth 7 started backlink foundation while continuing growth experiments. Used [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) establishing domain authority through 200+ directories. Published 3 blog posts weekly targeting buyer-intent keywords like \"workflow automation for X\" and comparison content. Domain authority went from 0 to 15 first month. Growth hacks continued but organic building alongside.​\n\nMonths 7-12 showed organic momentum building while growth hacks plateaued. Domain authority reached 26. Started ranking for 42 keywords. Getting 880 monthly organic visitors by month 12. First organic customers appeared month 9. By month 12 organic delivered 14 customers monthly while referral program and paid continued at similar levels. Growth hacks still working but not scaling.​\n\nMonths 13-14 showed organic scaling past all growth hacks. Traffic reached 1480 monthly visitors. Ranking for 58 keywords with 24 in top 10. Delivering 26-32 organic customers monthly. These customers had better retention with 12-month average LTV versus 9-month for paid and referral suggesting better product fit from organic channel.​\n\nThe CAC comparison after 14 months shows organic economics beat growth hacks. Paid plus growth experiments: $54,800 spent acquiring 112 customers equals $489 CAC. Organic backlinks: $1,380 invested acquiring 148 customers equals $9.32 CAC. Organic is 52x more efficient than growth hacking tactics that stop working when effort stops.​\n\nThe unit economics tell complete story about compound versus one-time tactics. Growth hack customers: $487 CAC, 9-month LTV, $801 lifetime value equals $314 profit per customer. Organic customers: $9 CAC, 12-month LTV, $1068 lifetime value equals $1059 profit per customer. Organic delivers 3.4x more profit per customer with way better margins.​ What worked for sustainable growth economics was targeting buyer-intent keywords not vanity traffic, optimizing conversion since organic visitors were qualified, creating comparison and use case content that converts, building email nurture for prospects not ready immediately, tracking cohort retention showing organic customers stay longer, and being patient through months 7-10 when organic investment wasn't yet paying off.​\n\n\nInvestment breakdown over 14 months was GetMoreBacklinks directory service $127 one-time, Ahrefs $99/month for 6 months then free tools, hosting $22/month, content tools $38/month average. Total $1,380 versus $54,800 on paid ads and growth experiments. The 40x cost difference creates completely different business economics.​ For other growth hackers the strategic lesson is compound tactics beat clever one-time hacks. Referral programs and viral loops provide short-term lift but don't scale sustainably. Backlink foundation built in month 7 still generates customers in month 14 with zero additional spend. Start building organic alongside growth experiments from day one.​ The mistake we made was treating SEO as boring and growth hacks as exciting. Reality is growth hacks are expensive treadmill requiring constant new tactics. Organic is boring compound machine that gets stronger monthly. The economics clearly favor boring fundamentals over sexy hacks.​",

One example in this space is Laiel.co.\n\nWhat stands out about tools like this is that they focus on AI-generated business assessments rather than classic growth dashboards. Instead of telling you how to grow a channel, they aim to surface higher-level constraints, positioning issues, or strategic gaps that might affect downstream growth outcomes.\n\nFrom a growth hacking perspective, this raises an interesting distinction between execution tools and decision-framing tools. The latter don’t replace experiments, but they can influence which experiments get prioritized and why.\n\nIt’s an interesting direction to watch as AI becomes more embedded earlier in the growth planning process rather than only at the optimization stage.",

In early stage, most growth failure isn’t channel inefficiency, it’s misprioritized bets based on incomplete understanding of constraints.\n\nWhere these tools fit best is before experimentation, not instead of it.\n\nThey’re most useful when they narrow the hypothesis space so teams run fewer experiments with higher expected value.\n\nThe risk is when they become static assessments rather than living inputs that update as the company learns.\n\nWhen they stay dynamic, they can meaningfully change what gets tested and why.\n\nCurious whether you’re looking at this more from a founder, operator, or builder perspective.",

Free plans are great for testing, but the real pain usually shows up when you have to rip everything out and migrate once you hit their limits. I’d map out what you realistically need over the next 12–24 months (team size, channels, volume) and pick a tool that fits that journey even if it starts paid, rather than optimizing only for free today and paying in switching costs later.",

No spam blasts. No pitch-first messages.\n\n**What surprised us**\n\n1. **Reply rates were 3–5× higher** than our previous outbound\n2. Sales conversations felt collaborative, not adversarial\n3. Many users literally replied with “Thanks, this is exactly what I needed”\n4. We spent *less time* selling and more time qualifying\n\n**What didn’t work**\n\n* Generic keyword alerts → too noisy\n* Automated replies → killed trust instantly\n* Jumping in too early → users hadn’t fully articulated the pain yet\n\n**The key insight**\n\nGrowth doesn’t come from louder distribution — it comes from **better timing**.\n\nPeople announce intent *before* they ever hit your landing page. If you can detect that moment, growth becomes less about persuasion and more about relevance.\n\nWe ended up building internal tooling to systemize this (which later evolved into a product), but the core lesson applies even if you do this manually.\n\n**Curious to hear from the community:**\n\n* Have you experimented with intent-based outreach vs traditional outbound?\n* Where have you found the highest-quality buying signals?\n* Do you think this scales, or is it only effective early-stage?\n\nWould love to compare notes.",

Focusing on expressed pain points makes conversations far more productive and less like pulling teeth.\n\nFor monitoring public conversations, I've tried a few options like Awario for general social listening, some custom scripts, and more recently LeadsRover for Reddit specifically. They all have different strengths, but I've found LeadsRover pretty effective for drilling down into active problem-solving discussions on Reddit.\n\nThe biggest challenge is consistently identifying genuine intent versus just general complaining, so really refining your \"problem-first language\" filters is crucial.",

You eventually need tools to listen for those signals automatically or you will burn out reading forums all day.\n\nFor the signals themselves, I find the best ones are hiring posts and \"tech stack\" questions in niche communities. If a founder asks \"what CRM connects to X\", they are ready to buy right now.\n\nI use a good data enrichment tool to close the loop on this. Once I find the person asking for help on LinkedIn, I use it to pull their verified work email. It is helpful here because it lets me take the conversation off a noisy comment section and into a professional inbox where B2B deals actually get signed.",

Group them by positioning (premium vs cheap, niche vs generalist), then test DM angles that flip that exact positioning: “we’re the hands-on version of X,” “we focus only on Y use case,” etc.\n\n\n\nOn my side I’ve used tools like SignalScouter and GummySearch to catch the same prospects when they complain or ask for help on Reddit, then sent super short, practical replies instead of pitches. Pulse for Reddit just helps me not miss those threads and draft faster, but the real win is keeping the message painfully specific to the problem they’re already talking about.\n\n\n\nSo instead of “which brands,” think “which positioning clusters” and build DMs around those.",

The downside It was incredibly time consuming I would literally F5 search constantly most days I wouldnt even be able to go through all the notifications.\n\n  \nI actually built an internal tool to solve this for myself which has now become my main project. It automatically finds relevant conversations across Reddit X and LinkedIn. Its what brought me here. It lets you engage with your target audience directly and Reddits great because users there are often deep into their niches.\n\n  \nIf you think that kind of thing could help you scale your SaaS Im happy to let you try it out.",

Felt stuck between scale and quality.\n\nThe breakthrough was separating data work from personalization work. Instead of reps spending half their time researching companies and building context, we automated that entire layer with tapistro.\n\nNow the system automatically pulls company info, tracks all their digital signals, monitors news and team changes, surfaces the relevant context for each account. Reps just get a dossier with everything they need to write intelligent outreach.\n\nCut research time from 25 min per account down to maybe 5 min of reviewing the automated brief. Reps can now hit their 500 account quota in the same amount of time they used to spend on 150 accounts.\n\nReply rates actually went up 31% because the outreach is still personalized and thoughtful, we just automated all the grunt work that was eating our time.

I know the tools, have problem solving mindset, and have a proven record of improving KPIs.  \n  \nDespite this, I’m getting no interview callbacks, which is confusing and honestly frustrating.  \n  \nLooking for advice, especially from Startup founders and hiring PMs:  \n  \n\\- How do you evaluate PMs while hiring?  \n\\- Is this a resume/portfolio/branding issue?  \n\\- Should I prioritize networking & cold outreach over job boards?  \n\\- What makes you say, “Yes, let’s talk” to a PM profile?  \n  \nAny honest feedback is appreciated. 🙌\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "**Getting Your Founder Story Published on Startup Sites (Where to pitch and how to get featured easily)**\n\nAfter launch, most founders obsess over features, pricing, and traffic. Very few think about storytelling — which is ironic, because stories are often the fastest way to build trust when nobody knows your product yet.\n\nStartup and founder-focused sites exist for one simple reason: people love reading *how* things started. And early-stage SaaS stories perform especially well because they feel real, messy, and relatable. This episode is about turning your journey into visibility without begging editors or paying for PR.\n\n# 1. What “Founder Story” Sites Actually Look For\n\nThese platforms aren’t looking for unicorn announcements or fake success narratives. They want honest stories from people building in the trenches.\n\nMost editors care about:\n\n* Why you started the product  \n* What problem pushed you over the edge  \n* Mistakes, pivots, and lessons learned  \n* How real users reacted early on  \n\nIf your story sounds like a press release, it gets ignored. If it sounds like a human learning in public, it gets published.\n\n# 2. Why Founder Stories Work So Well Post-Launch\n\nRight after MVP launch, you’re in a credibility gap. You exist, but nobody *trusts* you yet.\n\nFounder stories help because:\n\n* They humanize the product behind the UI  \n* They explain context features alone can’t  \n* They create emotional buy-in before conversion  \n\nPeople may forget features, but they remember *why you built this*.\n\n# 3. This Is Not PR — It’s Distribution With Personality\n\nMany founders assume they need a PR agency to get featured. You don’t.\n\nFounder-story sites are content machines. They need new stories constantly, and most are happy to publish directly from founders if the story is clear and honest.\n\nThink of this as:\n\n* Content distribution, not media coverage  \n* Relationship building, not pitching  \n* Long-tail visibility, not viral spikes  \n\n# 4. Where Founder Stories Actually Get Published\n\nThere are dozens of sites that regularly publish founder journeys. Some are big, some are niche — both matter.\n\nCommon categories:\n\n* Startup interview blogs  \n* Indie founder platforms  \n* Bootstrapped SaaS communities  \n* Product-led growth blogs  \n* No-code / AI / remote founder sites  \n\nThese pages often rank well in Google and keep sending traffic long after publication.\n\n# 5. How to Choose the Right Sites for Your SaaS\n\nDon’t spray your story everywhere. Pick platforms aligned with your audience.\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n* Do their readers match my users?  \n* Do they publish SaaS stories regularly?  \n* Are posts written in a conversational tone?  \n* Do they allow backlinks to my product?  \n\nFive relevant features beat fifty random mentions.\n\n# 6. The Anatomy of a Story Editors Say Yes To\n\nYou don’t need to be a great writer. You need a clear structure.\n\nStrong founder stories usually include:\n\n* A relatable problem (before the product)  \n* A breaking point or frustration  \n* The first version of the solution  \n* Early struggles after launch  \n* Lessons learned so far  \n\nProgress matters more than polish.\n\n# 7. How to Pitch Without Sounding Desperate or Salesy\n\nMost founders overthink pitching. Keep it simple.\n\nA good pitch:\n\n* Is short (5–7 lines max)  \n* Mentions why the story fits *their* site  \n* Focuses on lessons, not promotion  \n* Links to your product casually, not aggressively  \n\nEditors care about content quality first. Traffic comes later.\n\n# 8. Why These Stories Are SEO Gold Over Time\n\nFounder story posts often live on high-authority domains and rank for:\n\n* Your brand name  \n* “How X started”  \n* “Founder of X”  \n* Problem-based keywords  \n\nThis creates a network of pages that reinforce your brand credibility long after the post is published.\n\n# 9. Repurposing One Story Into Multiple Assets\n\nOne founder story shouldn’t live in one place.\n\nYou can repurpose it into:\n\n* A Founder Story page on your site  \n* LinkedIn or Reddit posts  \n* About page copy  \n* Sales conversations  \n* Investor or partner context  \n\nWrite once. Reuse everywhere.\n\n\n\n# 10. The Long-Term Benefit Most Founders Miss\n\nFounder stories don’t just bring traffic — they attract *people*.\n\nOver time, they help you:\n\n* Build a recognizable personal brand  \n* Attract higher-quality users  \n* Start conversations with peers  \n* Earn trust before the first click  \n\nIn early SaaS, trust compounds faster than features.\n\nIf there’s one mindset shift here, it’s this:  \n **People don’t just buy software — they buy into the people building it.**\n\n👉 **Stay tuned for the upcoming episodes in this playbook—more actionable steps are on the way.**\n\n",

Instead of keeping everything closed until launch, we’re opening an **invite-only community** for builders who want to be closer to the process.\n\nInside the community:\n\n* live access to how our products are being built\n* early beta access to test prototypes before release\n* direct conversations with the team\n* other perks we’re still shaping with early members\n\nThis isn’t for everyone, and it’s intentionally small.\n\nIf you’re curious and want an invite, **comment “interested”** and we’ll share the link.\n\nHappy to answer questions here as well.",

      "text": "not sure if this'll help anyone but figured i'd share.\n\nso a few months back, we noticed something weird clients suddenly started saying:\n\n\"i found you guys on chatgpt, Grok suggested me, AI recommended me\"\n\nand that's when it clicked.\n\nOur team then updated our calendar page with AI option 2 months ago, and we were shocked to see 30% of the people who scheduled a meeting put \"AI recommended\" option.\n\nAI search is the new SEO, we at [u/offshorewolf](https://www.reddit.com/user/offshorewolf/)  Wolf gave it a fancy name, we call it LMO - Language Model Optimization, nobody's talking about it yet, so just wanted to share what we changed to rank.\n\nhere's how we started ranking across all the big LLMs: chatgpt, claude, grok\n\n\\#1 We started contributing on communities\n\nEvery like, comment, share, links to our website increased the number of meetings we get from AI SEO,\n\nso we heavily started contributing on platforms like quora, reddit, medium and the result? Way more organic meetings - all for free.\n\n\\#2 We wrote content like we were talking to AI\n\n* clear descriptions of what we do\n* mentioned our brand + keywords in natural language\n* added tons of Q&A-style content (like FAQs, but smarter)\n* gave context LLMs can latch onto: who we help, what we solve, how we're different\n\n\\#3 we posted content designed for AI memory\n\nwe used to post for humans scrolling. now we post for AI\n\nstuff like:\n\n* Reddit posts that mention our brand + niche keywords (this post helps AI too)\n* Twitter threads with full company name + positioning\n* guest posts on forums and blogs that ChatGPT scans\n\nwe planted seeds across the internet so LLMs could connect the dots.\n\n\\#4 we answered questions before people even asked them\n\non our site and socials, we added things like:\n\n* \"What companies provide VAs for under $500 a month?\"\n* \"How much do VAs cost in 2025?\"\n* \"Who are the top remote hiring platforms?\"\n\nturns oout, when enough people see that kind of language, AI starts using it too.\n\n\\#5. we stopped chasing google, we started building trust with LLMs\n\nour Marketing Manager says,Google SEO will be cooked in 5-10 years\n\nits crazy to see chatgpt usage growth, in the past 1/2 years, there's some people who now use chatgpt for everything, like a personal advisor or assistant\n\nto rank, we created:\n\n* comparison tables\n* real testimonials (worded like natural convos)\n* super clear \"who we're for / who we're not for\" copy\n\nLLMs love clarity.\n\ntl,dr\n\nWe stopped writing for Google. We started writing for GPTs.\n\nNow when someone asks:\n\n\"Who's the best VA company under $500/month full time?\"\n\nWe come up 50% of the time.\n\nWe have asked our team members in Ukraine, Philippines, India, Nepal to try searching, with cookies disabled, VPN, and from new browsers, we come up,\n\nThank you for staying till the end.\n\nHappy to make a part 2 including a LMO content calendar that we use at our company.",
