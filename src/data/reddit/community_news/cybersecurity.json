      "text": "[https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/cisa-madhu-gottumukkala-chatgpt-00749361](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/cisa-madhu-gottumukkala-chatgpt-00749361)\n\n>  \nThe interim head of the country’s cyber defense agency uploaded sensitive contracting documents into a public version of ChatGPT last summer, triggering multiple automated security warnings that are meant to stop the theft or unintentional disclosure of government material from federal networks, according to four Department of Homeland Security officials with knowledge of the incident.\n\n>The apparent misstep from Madhu Gottumukkala was especially noteworthy because the acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had requested special permission from CISA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer to use the popular AI tool soon after arriving at the agency this May, three of the officials said. The app was blocked for other DHS employees at the time.\n\n>None of the files Gottumukkala plugged into ChatGPT were classified, according to the four officials, each of whom was granted anonymity for fear of retribution. But the material included CISA contracting documents marked “for official use only,” a government designation for information that is considered sensitive and not for public release.\n\n>Cybersecurity sensors at CISA flagged the uploads this past August, said the four officials. One official specified there were multiple such warnings in the first week of August alone. Senior officials at DHS subsequently led an internal review to assess if there had been any harm to government security from the exposures, according to two of the four officials.\n\n>It is not clear what the review concluded.\n\n>In an emailed statement, CISA’s Director of Public Affairs Marci McCarthy said Gottumukkala “was granted permission to use ChatGPT with DHS controls in place,” and that “this use was short-term and limited.” McCarthy added that the agency was committed to “harnessing AI and other cutting-edge technologies to drive government modernization and deliver on” Trump’s executive order [removing barriers to America’s leadership in AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/).\n\n>The email also appeared to dispute the timeline of POLITICO’s reporting: “Acting Director Dr. Madhu Gottumukkala last used ChatGPT in mid-July 2025 under an authorized temporary exception granted to some employees. CISA’s security posture remains to block access to ChatGPT by default unless granted an exception.”\n\n>",

Probably what happened was a random user came up with something amazing, OpenAI siphoned it, (as they do, through cybersecurity methods) it turned out to be extremely important.\n\nSo now the official narrative is “Trump’s cyber security Chief uploaded it accidentally.”\n\nI don’t trust this for a second. People come up with amazing things using AI and it gets swiped. STOLEN.\n\nAsk Suchir Balaji. Oh wait, that’s right, Suchir Balaji is dead.\n\nSomeone should connect these dots before the elite destroy this planet…\n\nElla Cook. Nuno Loureiro, Feng Yanghe, TANG XIAOOU, HE ZHI, ZHANG DAIBING, QUAN YUHUI.\n\nAll dead. All working on high value, high target things. Once their work was completed… DEAD.\n\nIt’s all right there. Nobody cares. People make silly AI pictures and complain about small things like AI stole their pictures, and novels, and videos... It’s sickening.\n\nAI companies steal BIG things.\n\nSuchir Balaji knew that. He was a whistleblower. Now he’s dead. Everyone on this list is dead. How did that happen? Uh, maybe… the government had them murdered?!",

We show an adversary can extract gigabytes of training data from open-source language models like Pythia or GPT-Neo, semi-open models like LLaMA or Falcon, and closed models like ChatGPT. Existing techniques from the literature suffice to attack unaligned models; in order to attack the aligned ChatGPT, we develop a new divergence attack that causes the model to diverge from its chatbot-style generations and emit training data at a rate 150x higher than when behaving properly. Our methods show practical attacks can recover far more data than previously thought, and reveal that current alignment techniques do not eliminate memorization.",

If you disable biometric unlock:\n\n\n\n1. You MUST use a strong passphrase (15+ chars, mixed case). A simple PIN can be brute-forced in seconds during custody.\n\n\n\n2. Consider enabling a \"Duress PIN\" feature if available (newer Android/iOS). This logs you in without alerting the device they cracked it.\n\n\n\n3. Backup authentication factors (security keys, TOTP apps) should be stored separately from your primary device.\n\n\n\n4. The WaPo case highlights law enforcement's legal uncertainty here - they used biometrics in a warrantless seizure, which may not hold up under 5th Amendment challenges (unlike passcodes, which courts treat differently).\n\n\n\nThe real security posture: Layered authentication + understanding your threat model. If LEA is your primary threat, yes disable biometrics. If it's account takeover, keep them enabled with strong backup auth.",

Weigh that against being able to police your people 24/7, 7 days a week, for the full year without any technological roadblocks. The benefit of having all that data to solve/investigate the most pressing immediate issues: domestic terrorism, groups you don't like, criminals, every police investigation with an encrypted device/application. Those benefits far exceed the cost of losing some info to China every once in a while. The truly important state secrets can be kept off the internet entirely, in secure facilities.\n\nYou can point at instances where adversaries benefit all you want.

      "text": "I've been working for 2 years as a mid-level manager for a medium-sized fintech company based somewhere in Asia. I work as an individual contributor reporting directly to the CISO though my tasks require me to work a lot cross-functionally with other team members.\n\nI accomplished a lot with our previous CISO before he left the company mid last year. Then around 6 months ago, a new chief came in. It turns out that he was previously a CISO of one of the largest fintech companies globally which I'm sure everyone here has heard of. Apparently, the CEO knew him when they worked together in the previous conpany.\n\nWe worked in different regional offices and barely spoke in the first 2-3 months despite me actively reaching out to him several times. He didn't set any weekly meetings with me or the broader team, nor he even tried to understand what my tasks were and learn about the current state of things.\n\nOftentimes, I would DM him to get an approval or an update, but he wouldn't respond until a day or two. He would just reply 'OK' or totally ignore my messages. Naturally, I was pissed but I just continued my daily BAU tasks.\n\nHe's Chinese (which I don't speak), but he understood and spoke English well enough on a conversational level.\n\nAround 3 months in, he started becoming a bit more active. We started having weekly updates with him, however, he also asked me and his other direct reports to report directly to the president. He let us do the updates on our own per team and sometimes he wouldn't speak a single word throughout the call. This pissed a lot of us since we all understood that it should be his job as CISO. All directives came from the president and he never started any initiatives on his own. Basically, he just let us do whatever we want.\n\nAt the start of the year, the audit from our regulator began. Our team was asked to do an overview presentation and he asked us to fill in the slides though the auditor required that it should be him to present it. All he had to do was understand and explain the slides.\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon before the presentation, he sent a group message to all us his direct reports that we should do a write up for him on the slides and we should complete it before the day ends so he can review it (mind you, the presentation was still on Wednesday). I was in utter disbelief when I read this. I was out with my family at the time and won't be back until after dinner. Of course, the rest of the team and I did it for him.\n\nOn the day of the presentation, I was sitting in the office room together with our regulators. He was put on call as he was allowed to do it remotely. To no surprise, he read the write-up word per word like an AI voice-over. It was painfully obvious for everyone in the room, but since we're behind schedule, they just let him be. I could've summarized and explained all the slides by heart.\n\nTo this day, I don't think he understands what the team is doing. They say a CISO's first 100 days should be enough to build a roadmap for the team. We're way past that and we're still nowhere near any semblance of one, and my colleagues already started leaving one by one.\n\nThat's all he is to me -- a decorative wallflower.\n\nAny ideas on how to deal with this situation?",

A man who claims to be a realist has to challenge the whole of the ancient faith. If it does not stand the onslaught of reason it crumbles down.\"\n\nSimilarly, if you, the cyber professional, cannot answer 5 Whys about your policies, security controls, or your security solutions, people stop paying attention to you, your voice loses value. If the only thing that comes to your mind is \"this is policy\", you are the problem.\n\n\nNow that you have identified the problem, start working towards a solution. Develop some empathy, walk a mile in the opposite person's shoes, understand what they are trying to do, how can you help to make their job/task/activity safe. If you don't know, be honest. I do not know everything. Nobody is putting a gun to your head and demanding an answer right away.

That gives a false sense of security. \n\nBut as we know, that couldn't be farther from reality. You may be secure just because you haven't become a prominent target. But that can change fast as well as your exposure.\n\nSo unfortunately, sometimes you need to wait until something really bad happens in order to make security relevant.",

One statement he made was close to \"I'm security and you are going to do this and do it right away.\"  He had a really bad rep with just about everyone.\n\nMore often than not the cybersecurity teams I've been on have mostly people with that attitude.  I have built a very good relationship with just about everyone I work with.  For me it comes down to \"know before no\".\n\nSometimes our conversation lets me understand why they want to do something against policy and we can figure out a better solution.  Sometimes it's just fundamentally wrong and I work to make sure that teammate understands the reasoning behind the policy.\n\nIt's also in the area of vulnerbility scanning.  Far too many teams only go off the CVE or similar score and tell the support teams to fix everything with a high/critical rating.  Want to tick off teammates, blindly tell them it needs to be fixed.\n\nThere is a fair amount of technical issue but people skills are a must.",

The only calculus is in \"best practices\", \"vibes\", or thoughtlessly following NIST 800-53 or other frameworks (e.g., mandating password changes in 2026 when paired with strong MFA -- assuming no evidence of compromise).\n2. Skills: A lot of cyber guys simply don't have enough engineering skills to earn the respect of developers, also related to #1. This also goes the other way, too. How many cyber teams out there are staffed with glorified sysadmins who on;y know how to manage vendor solutions, not real hackers? How many cyber engineers don't really know linux, or deep network internals, etc?\n3. Culture: The team of \"no\", instead of \"yes, and\" - or better stated - allow us to derisk where you are trying to go. A world of bureaucracy and process, instead of paved roads with guiderails. tl;dr, too much friction, not enough consideration of the \"user experience\" - be it for developers, endusers, customers, etc.\n\nIn a world where cyber professionals were more calculated about risk and had deeper skills across the stack, I think they would be a lot more respected.\n\nSource: used to own cyber function in a smaller org, now don't work in cyber in a large org and see it from both sides.",

I mean, the responsibility has always been on individual organizations to secure themselves, but organizations like NIST and MITRE have made it cheaper and easier for them by vetting, centralizing, and prioritizing crucial information.

Now that it's being dismantled, things will get worse for our colleagues on the ground trying to defend organizations like your local hospitals, schools and utilities.\n\nThis is everything that foreign threat actors could have hoped for. Life is going to be more chaotic and IT and OT systems will be less reliable. It will put people at risk, and it will definitely cost the economy.

That isn't to say that there aren't some particular specialisations you can't excel in early, but they're typically risky fields to play in without a solid head screwed on, and unless you're the Electron or Phoenix type, you're typically not getting hired by the agencies you end up probing anyway.\n\nGet experience in networking, get experience in servers, databases, some coding if possible, and expose yourself to as much different types of technologies, brands and stacks as possible til you can instinctively tie anything you look at to a particular layer of OSI or other model with complete comprehension how they cross interact. Then get into cyber.\n\nOr sit at a SOC watch logs scroll on your screen all day and pass alerts to the senior security engineers for the same amount of time on the hopes that someone will take you under their wing.\n\nEdit: To add, Cybersecurity has to have some of the worst work/life balance ratios in an industry notorious for terrible work/life balance as it is. It is NOT a walk in the park, and you are assuming so much more responsibility and liability for negligent actions when you claim \"cybersecurity\".",

Most low level and entry level type positions in cyber are gone.  People with beginner skills are not really needed…..  AI has taken a vast majority of low skilled or straight out of college positions.  Yes there are jobs available but realistically the number of low skilled positions are very limited.  On most job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) if you don’t know someone at the company that is hiring you have a nearly a 0% chance at getting even an interview.  A new job gets posted and within 2 hours more than 500 people submit an application.  From those everything is scanned by AI to find the top 5 candidates for an interview. Federal workers with 10+ years are being laid off and then are applying to 100 jobs over 8+ months before getting rehired.  Top analysts at major companies like Crowdstrike, big accounting and consulting firms are all being let go as nearly every company is restructuring positions and replacing many bodies with AI.",

We use Canaries and I find them quite good at what they do and feeling more like a real asset.\n\nWe don’t put honeypots on all VLANs, only generally in the higher value areas. Pair that with well segmented VLANs that separate device types, I can have some comfort in knowing those lower grade IoT networks don’t pose much of a threat to me so I don’t necessarily honeypot those.  You’d probably get most of the noise from those IoT and guest type networks. But if they just cannot get to other more valuable things, then good!\n\nSo in the early days of honeypot deployment we may have had a few hits like a print server doing a broadcast, or a license server doing a broadcast. You can quickly tune (or stop!) those. After than the alerts are quite quiet and when we do get one we take full notice of it.",

They should be set up in such a way that it's basically guaranteed that you are compromised if they go off.

If they log in as admin, they hacked the prod server and that's a crime, a good reason to fire them. If someone else logs in, that's a compromise.

It's mostly just the hyperscalers, three-letter-agencies, and dedicated security companies who can justify the resources for that kind of thing. It's not a profit center, after all. The most common pattern I've seen is that honeypots are a hobby project that gets abandoned when the creator gets bored or moves jobs. And then you've get a poorly maintained machine out in the wild to manage risk around. Fun!",
