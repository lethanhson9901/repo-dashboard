Assuming a normal distribution, that means you'll have 33,554,432 '1' or 'l'.\n\nYou then have to generate a new 'attempted file' for each 33,554,432 to cover each '1' or 'l'. That's a 2\\^n problem. 2\\^33554432 is....\n\n3.3x10\\^10,100,890\n\nYou have to run that many passes against the original 1GB - That's... a lot. Each pass is dirt cheap but the scaling's an issue. Simple problems to code and there's some clever things to improve the average time to hit (don't generate '1' and 'l' sequentially but randomly) but it's still a wild amount to crunch.\n\nOf course - that's assuming a multimedia, MASSIVE pdf. Assuming 1MB PDF, it's 1.4X10\\^9864. That's probably doable even on consumer hardware.\n\nWould be interesting for someone to benchmark it.\n\nAn LLM can make the code easily though:\n\n\"Generate python code to go through an array of characters, find all positions that are a '1' or an 'l', and then generate a an array of new arrays of characters, generating one new character array for each possible permutation of the original array where '1' and 'l' are replaced with either '1' or 'l'\n\nex. 'alcdl' + \\[1,4\\]\n\nOutput: alcdl, a1cdl, alcd1, a1cd1\"\n\nOf course that's the dumb version, you don't want to blow your memory up my storing all the intermediate attempt generations (you'd attempt a decode on the fly and break the loop if the API succeeded). And as mentioned you'd want to randomize the generation instead of keeping it linear. But, doable. Probably take an hour or two to hack together.",

Perhaps we could generate a set of manually labeled characters, train a lightweight network to recognize and classify characters based on that manual set, and then apply the network to the base64. I don’t expect that the network will produce an accurate classification of all l and 1’s but it does give us a place to start a search. Suppose that we use the network to spit out a list of only l/1’s with less than 60% classification certainty. We could attempt a brute force search on the reduced space of indeterminate characters to find the raw text in a reasonable time.\n\nWhile we’re on it there’s a couple of journals in epstein’s emails that appear to use either substitution or permutation ciphers for handwritten notes. \n\nhttps://www.jmail.world/drive/vol00012-efta02731433-pdf\n\nhttps://www.jmail.world/drive/vol00012-efta02731260-pdf",

Currently we manually sync branch “version/v4.5” while the big rework in “main” is still in development and will only be synced when it’s released.\n2. v4.5 only receives cosmetic changes and supporting libraries updates (which are pretty substantial though). The libraries that implement the actual app logic are SafariConverterLib, DnsLibs, AdguardAssistant. They are all also open source, available on Github, and used by many other ad blockers.\n\n>I learned that the way they fix up ads is by executing 20,000+ lines of javascript on EVERY SINGLE WEBSITE you load\n\nI wouldn’t agree with the exact number of lines, but yes, modern ad blocking requires executing a lot of JavaScript.\n\n>I kept digging and learned that Adguard is registered in Cyprus but all the developers live in Moscow.\n\nThat’s simply not true. After 2022 a large part of the team was relocated and nowadays, most of the team does not live there, especially key personnel.   \nThat said, there is no “ban” on ru. Moreover, since this is open source, we will be happy to have contributions from anywhere, be it Russia, US, China, etc.\n\n",

      "text": "OpenClaw is already scary from a security perspective..... but watching the ecosystem around it get infected this fast is honestly insane.\n\nI recently interviewed **Paul McCarty** (maintainer of **OpenSourceMalware**) after he found **hundreds of malicious skills** on **ClawHub**.\n\nBut the thing that really made my stomach drop was **Jamieson O’Reilly** detailed post on how he gamed the system and built malware that became the number 1 downloaded skill on ClawHub -> [https://x.com/theonejvo/status/2015892980851474595](https://x.com/theonejvo/status/2015892980851474595) (Well worth the read)\n\nHe built a **backdoored (but harmless) skill**, then used bots to inflate the download count to **4,000+**, making it the **#1 most downloaded skill on ClawHub**… and real developers from **7 different countries** executed it thinking it was legit.\n\nThis matters because Peter Steinberger (the creator of OpenClaw) has basically taken the stance of:\n\n>use your brain and don't download malware \n\n(Peter has since deleted his responses to this, see screen shots here [https://opensourcemalware.com/blog/clawdbot-skills-ganked-your-crypto](https://opensourcemalware.com/blog/clawdbot-skills-ganked-your-crypto)\n\n…but Jamieson’s point is that **“use your brain” collapses instantly when the trust signals are fakeable.**\n\n# What Jamieson provedClawHub’s download counter could be manipulated with unauthenticated requests\n\n* There was **no rate limiting**\n* The server trusted **X-Forwarded-For**, meaning you can spoof IPs trivially\n* So an attacker can go:\n   1. publish malicious skill\n   2. bot downloads\n   3. become “#1 skill”\n   4. profit\n\nAnd the skill itself was extra nasty in a subtle way:\n\n* the ClawHub UI mostly shows **SKILL .md**\n* but the real payload lived in a referenced file (ex: `rules/logic.md`)\n* meaning users see “clean marketing,” while Claude sees “run these commands”\n\n# Why ClawHub is a supply chain disaster waiting to happen\n\n* **Skills aren’t libraries, they’re executable instructions**\n* **The agent already has permissions**, and the skill runs *inside that trust*\n* **Popularity is a lie** (downloads are a fakeable metric)\n* **Peter’s response is basically “don’t be dumb”**\n* **Most malware so far is low-effort** (“curl this auth tool” / ClickFix style)\n* Which means the serious actors haven’t even arrived yet\n\nIf ClawHub is already full of “dumb malware,” I’d bet anything there’s a room of APTs right now working out how to publish a “top skill” that quietly steals, credentials, crypto... all the things North Korean APTs are trying to steal.\n\nI sat down with paul to disucss his research, thoughts and ongoing fights with Peter about making the ecosystem some what secure.  [https://youtu.be/1NrCeMiEHJM](https://youtu.be/1NrCeMiEHJM)\n\nI understand that things are moving quickly but in the words of Paul \"You don't get to leave a loaded ghost gun in a playground and walk away form all responsibility of what comes next\"",

The agent doesn’t have a concept of “this file looks suspicious.” It has a concept of “I was told to use this skill and here are the instructions.”\n\nWhat makes this structurally worse than traditional supply chain attacks (npm, PyPI, etc.) is the permission model inversion. With a malicious npm package, the payload runs with whatever permissions the consuming application has, and in most deployments that’s scoped. With ClawHub skills, the payload runs inside an agent that likely already has filesystem access, shell execution, browser control, messaging credentials, and API keys. The skill doesn’t need to escalate privileges — it inherits them.\n\nAnd Peter’s “use your brain” response (deleted or not) reveals a fundamental architectural philosophy: security is the user’s responsibility, not the platform’s. That works when your users are security engineers. It doesn’t work when you have 149K GitHub stars and Codecademy is writing onboarding tutorials for beginners.\nWhat’s missing from OpenClaw — and what nobody in the ecosystem is really building yet — are the structural controls that make “use your brain” unnecessary:\n\n\t∙\tSkill allowlisting — nothing executes unless it’s on a vetted list, not a popularity-ranked marketplace\n\t∙\tStatic analysis gates — AST scanning for dangerous patterns (os.system, subprocess, eval, network calls) before a skill is ever eligible\n\t∙\tPer-agent budget ceilings — so even a compromised skill can’t run up unlimited API costs\n\t∙\tCryptographic signing — so you can verify a skill hasn’t been tampered with between publish and install\n\t∙\tAudit trails with layer enforcement traces — so you can forensically reconstruct what a skill actually did vs. what it claimed to do\n\nI’ve been building these as an open-source framework at SammaSuit.com — eight enforced security layers specifically designed around the gaps OpenClaw leaves open. The allowlist-based skill gating (what we call SANGHA) is the direct answer to the ClawHub trust problem: instead of “download what’s popular and hope it’s not malware,” it’s “nothing runs unless you’ve explicitly approved it.” Not a marketplace — a gate.\n\nJamieson and Paul are doing critical work surfacing these issues. The uncomfortable next step is building the infrastructure that makes the exploitation paths they’ve documented structurally impossible rather than just documented.",

Hell, they have staff who've leaked logs before.\n\nChina has been selling its GFW technology for quite a while now and going through brokers in the EU to do it. I'm sure we'll see it soon enough in Europe. Personally, I'm hoping for hand-rolled solutions (as the best case worst case scenario) because I don't think my government (UK) in its present state is capable of creating anything as difficult to work around as the GFW (which had a huge headstart, co-evolved with the web, and has decades of iterative upgrades and real-world pen testing).\n\nI do find it tragicomic that people saw - and largely still see - internet censorship as \"that thing that happens in China and third-world dictatorships\" without recognising that the West (esp. Europe) has been creeping in that direction for 15 years now and rapidly accelerating. Now that people can't access sites as innocuous, even vacuous, as Imgur in the UK, they're starting to wake up to it. I find myself saying, \"Yes, that's the OSA you were so excited about and never read. Thanks.\"\n\nBTW, where's the source on Musk/X performing that function in the US? In much of Europe, it often seems to many people like he's providing the mainstream bulwark against the OSA/DSA/etc. Personally, I'm wishing Wyoming the best with its plan to become the anti-OSA state. The law's drafters say that it'll free the net for the entire world due to their resistance to pressure from all other nation states, though it remains to be seen if they can do that.

      "text": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\nTLDR: we've had a lot of red teams performed against our org by third parties. Those performed by well-known US consultancies have been extremely poor quality. In contrast, we have recently finished up our first RT provided by a UK firm and the difference in quality was a chasm. Why is this the case and has anyone else noticed this.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nA quick bit about me: I'm a SOC manager at a large US financial, I have over a decade of experience in defense and have seen all sorts of interesting incidents. These days my role is all about skilling up our next generation of analysts, for which I heavily rely on Red Team engagements (adversary simulations, not pentests).\n\nTo get to the point, over the last 5 years we have had yearly Red Team engagements performed against us. I won't name names of who we've used (and I'm not part of the procurement process - for now....) but they have all been performed by well-known consultancies based in the US, with the exception of the most recent assessment which was a UK firm. We cycle through vendors so each assessment has been performed by different companies.\n\nEvery single one of the US Red Teams have failed miserably. I'd consider us a mature environment, we have to be, but I'm not naive enough to think we are inpenetrable. Having said that, I honestly don't understand how people are recommended these companies and constantly hyping them up as \"hardcore Red Teamers\". Some highlights over the years:\n\nFor example, on last years assessment they tried phishing users by sending a mass email campaign without any setup or social engineering. Just an email to 50 users with a link. Immediately got caught by our ESG. They then immediately went to assumed breach by requesting a laptop and vpn. They then did the entire assessment from the laptop without even attempting to get an implant running on it (and got caught the moment they tried to RDP to a host they shouldn't have). \n\nMost of the US teams we have used don't even bother with phishing, they almost always go straight to assumed breach, and regularly request exceptions made for their implants. It's so low effort I don't understand the point. All of them use completely out-dated techniques, which on its own isn't a bad thing, but they don't even try and adapt them to bypass signature based detections - like the team the year before who got caught using impacket without any alterations.\n\nIn contrast, the UK team we used (who I think are quite well known in those parts but maybe less so over here) were on a completely different level. They got in through a phishing campaign they had built up over 3 weeks of social engineering. Once inside they barely made any noise and reading the report it feels like every single tool they used was either completely custom or heavily adapted. We did detect them twice, but they had executed their techniques and built their payloads in such a way that they blended in with the environment and as a result both detections got marked FP. The whole engagement was eye opening, especially for our board who had a false sense of security from previous assessments.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm making this post. It might be out of frustration more than anything. I have seen post after post about how amazing X is, or how Y's team are the gold standard, and yet we have seen RTs done by all of these companies and to me they seem completely overhyped. Has anyone else had similar experiences? Does any from the UK (and maybe EU) understand why there is such a difference?\n\nFinal note: please don't ask about specific companies, you can guess all you want I won't answer. ",

Exposure to that/those greatly assists with the maturity of Red Teams and how they will approach the scenario. \n\nI would guess that the cost of the RT from a US supplier was lower than the UK one (once you’ve converted to a common currency). Would cost have been a factor in the previous decision making process?\n\nFrom the conversations we have as a sales team with our US & APAC sales colleagues, the US is quite immature by comparison (not having a pop at you or yours) and the lack of centralisation for standards won’t help that mature quickly. \n\nHow are CREST doing on their global march?",

For one of our last engagements we didn’t need a full blown beacon, we only required a Socks proxy, which we then injected and persisted through a beign process. \n\nFinally, having beacons white listed is a debate among the red team community. Some teams (like ours) spend a lot of time in R&D to bypass EDR. However, imagine if this time was instead spent looking for problems in our corporate environment. It may some reduce the companies risk in the long run.

When I was a detection engineer and the company brought in their own red team, they were given two VMs inside the core server network with no logging, EDR, or other telemetry. They still struggled with being successful but they did eventually get into a server (via PW guessing against user passwords). They tripped my alarms over 500 times and we were never allowed to contain or eradicate them.\n\nPersonally, I don’t consider what they did to be a true pen test. It’s not white box (full vulnerability and config insight) nor black box (no insights). I personally consider this type of engagement to be more of a vulnerability test / confirmation than a pen test. I think management assumes this approach saves money and if it satisfies auditors then I think that’s all they care about.\n\nImagine assuming breach, giving pen testers a foothold, and then being surprised they got in; well no shit they got in, you let them in. The only thing worse would be giving them an internal foothold and then having them fail to successfully “get in”. Never used a UK or EU firm but it sounds like they’re doing it right.",

I can't really talk about the specifics of what I'm working on because of NDAs, but they will be lifted shortly I'll post our experiences to ostif.org.\n\nGenerally, and this speaking on eight different products that all have the same goals (findings bugs in open source software, and generating fixes automagically), these tools need a LOT of human assistance by a senior researcher to be effective, as their findings are inconsistent and it takes human triage time to sift through the issues. There is a 0% chance that a new version of Opus fundamentally changes that. It may improve or even dramatically improve the rates of meaningful findings, but you still have to comb through every single candidate result and verify that it's actually a security problem.\n\nThere's a lot of reasons for this, but namely, LLMs don't understand threat models well and they also don't have a grasp on complex topics like exploit-ability.\n\nI can give you a real world example from some of my own personal research that isn't under NDA. Claude 4.5 consistently calls out anything that wraps malloc as exploitable because it can overflow. You tell it that the function only handles trusted data inputs directly from malloc, and it will call it out again even when you tell it not to. The problem is that in the hands of someone who doesn't understand what they're looking at, they're going to report the 500,000+ times this happens in open source to every maintainer. You need a human sanity check to stop this from happening.\n\nPre-triage efforts using LLMs to sift through the output of the other LLM is a multi-faceted problem as well, because it will also make errors and let through some false positives still, but also it will take out genuine bugs and has a deterministic rate of false negatives as well. Not to mention that every time you add another layer of agents, and using Opus, you're talking a lot of tokens/electricity/cash burned for a solution that's still largely unusable.",

That's nice, how many agents were you running in parallel? I'm guessing they spent millions in tokens.\n\n\\-They specifically mention using \"human experts\" to review every bug before reporting them. Again they don't disclose the size of the team required to do this, nor the number of findings that were false positives. THIS is the key limitation to these tools right now. In open source no one has the resources to do this sifting. Claude also generated patches and they were also reviewed by engineers. Again, this is crucial to understand.\n\n  \n\\-They also call out Claude as not using SAST or fuzzing and simply using out of the box analysis. The error rates for this would be insanely high. They likely spent thousands of engineer-hours to review this all.\n\n\\-They also imply that the projects tested has SAST and fuzzing \"running for years\" which is kind of irrelevant. The strategy of any security research team is to look where the existing tools can't reach. You look to expand fuzzing coverage, add SAST rules that are relevant, and do manual analysis for logic bugs. It doesn't make sense to check for the same types of bugs that testing would have already found.\n\n\\-They then play the narrative of putting more tools in the hands of defenders. That's good and all. Actually it's fantastic that they spend enormous resources to do find and fix these bugs. It's great for open source and literally all of us. However, the entire post is based on this series of half-truths about how this was achieved, and it's written to get people and companies convinced that Claude is now a security research tool with zero drawbacks.\n\nAgain, it's great that Anthropic did this for open source. I'm also confident that these tools will continue to improve over time, and we may reach the summit someday where minimal human intervention is needed. But Anthropic burning millions of dollars worth of tokens and thousands of hours of engineer research time to achieve this doesn't give the message that they want. They had to tilt it like this and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nAlso, it's not just Anthropic doing this. See Zeropath, Aisle, and others doing the exact same thing, and not mentioning the false positive rates, the engineering costs of triage, and so on.",

The supply chain angle is different enough from the integration angle that it probably warrants a standalone pattern rather than trying to cram it into SP-027.\n\nFor suggesting patterns, GitHub issues on osa-data works well (github.com/opensecurityarchitecture/osa-data). But honestly threads like this work too -- we're tracking all the feedback.\n\nCheers, Russ",

We spend a great deal of time together and  able to just put up with someone is not going to cut it.   I have hired less jr, people with less skill because the simple fact I enjoy working with them.

During my initial interview for a job as a pentester, I had brought up my documentation method for every job I was applying to, the OSINT I would perform on each company to better understand them, and a timeline showing when any communication took place, regardless if it was from me or from them. I did this more for my benefit to better gauge my interactions with the organizations I was applying to and would then find myself not following back up on, holding myself accountable and also being able to recall hope I was treated by those organizations in the past. I offered to show the interviewer an example of what I did on them and they were incredibly impressed with it enough to ask if he could get a screenshot of it to share with the others.\n\nI've been with the company just a little over a year now and I can say it's been the skill that I benefit the most from. Being able to document things well and then translate that documentation into a report is so much more critical than your technical skills. If you can't convey what you did, the client either won't take what you're saying seriously or think you didn't do anything. Good documentation ensures that you can deliver on that. Technical skills can always be taught later with enough time and effort, assuming you're sufficiently motivated to learn.\n\nFor context to this, I spent a year and a half before I got this position trying to pivot from IT as a systems admin to information security as a pentester. My timing was terrible because just when I realized where my skillset made the most sense for my career, everyone and their grandmother had also bought into the hype about following in all those roles the cybersecurity industry was allegedly being to fill so badly. I was effectively competing with a flood of new college kids, which no doubt got me lost in the noise of so many applicants in a role that's already pretty saturated.",

In reality, those call backs are few and far between these days so I highly recommend finding somewhere or some people to practice with so you can make the nost of the callbacks you do get. Look online for interview workshops in your area or online. Take notes when you come across a new question that trips you up. \n\n\nNo amount of interview prep is going to help if you can't speak the language of networking and security so you gotta have your fundamentals down. This part is a lifelong journey though.\n\n\nAnd lets not forget a fair amount of luck.\n\n\nYou're right this sub like to wallow in doom and gloom... for good reason.

      "text": "Ring just rolled out a new AI feature called “Search Party” that helps people find lost dogs by scanning footage from nearby Ring cameras. When someone posts a missing-pet alert in the Neighbors app, the system looks for animals in recent clips from participating outdoor cameras. If there’s a possible match, the camera owner gets notified and can decide whether to share the video. Nothing is “automatically” sent to the person searching.\n\nRight now, the official use case is pets, and Ring says sharing is always optional. But the part that makes some people uneasy is the scale: a network of neighborhood cameras, combined with AI that can search across large areas. Some users have also said the feature was enabled by default, which raises questions about consent and awareness, even if you can turn it off.\n\nThat leads to the bigger discussion: if the tech can scan for dogs, it could theoretically be adapted to look for stolen property, missing people, or other targets in the future. That doesn’t mean it is being used that way today, but once the infrastructure exists, pressure to expand it usually follows especially from governments or law enforcement agencies looking for new tools.\n\nSo this isn’t proof of some secret program to track people, and there’s no indication that agencies like ICE are using this feature right now. But it is an example of how systems built for friendly, community uses can evolve into much more powerful surveillance tools over time. The real questions are about defaults, transparency, opt-in vs. opt-out, and what limits get set before those expansions ever happen.\n\nI feel like their Super Bowl ad was basically an advertisement to major organizations to get ideas they could work with RING on, and it’s not finding dogs.. lol\n\nEdit: have been in lunch demos of “think tanks” in DC who pitch to agencies and who else comes for the food. That commercial on the Super Bowl just stood out significantly because it was not for a consumer product. They call this a “proof point”\n\nAnyways just a warning to journalist and the public",

Coveware said that the program encrypts files with the wrong public key, making it impossible for the criminals to decrypt them, even if the victim pays for a decryption tool.\n\nNitrogen's malware makes the error of loading a new variable, a QWORD, into memory so that it overlaps with the public key.\n\nBecause the malware loads the public key at offset rsp+0x20 and the 8-byte QWORD at rsp+0x1c, it overwrites the first four bytes of the public key, meaning that an attacker-supplied decryptor would fail.\n\n\"Normally, when a public-private Curve25519 keypair is generated, the private key is generated first, and then the public key is derived subsequently based on the private key,\" Coveware said.\n\n\"The resulting corrupted public key wasn't generated based on a private key, it was generated by mistakenly overwriting a few bytes of another public key. The final outcome is that no one actually knows the private key that goes with the corrupted public key.\"\n\nNitrogen has been around since 2023. According to Coveware, it began as one of the various offshoots that borrowed code from the leaked Conti 2 builder.\n\nBarracuda Networks previously reported that it evolved into a ransomware group slowly over time. It first developed malware to facilitate initial access for others, although its operators didn't work as initial access brokers, but began extorting organizations in or around September 2024.\n\nWhile it is not one of the most prolific groups in operation, it is also not to be underestimated.\n\nEven with this latest finding, which will go down alongside other epic own goals by ransomware gangs, it's hard to see the funny side with this one.\n\nThe coding error takes this financially-motivated ransomware gang into the realm of pure destruction, where both parties walk away losers.\"",

A few reasons: First, the sheer number of lines of code is constantly growing. Second, there will always be new computing paradigms that need to be figured out (to name a few hot topics: edge device security, Zero Trust, Operational Technology), which means \"moving target,\" which means, \"needs security professionals.\" Third, AI is always going to be fallible and incomplete and need humans to supplement it. Incidentally, a fully automated 100% correct catch-all bug-finding program is impossible by Rice's theorem. It's my belief, if not a fact, that this implies AI security tools will always require human guidance at a minimum. Fourth, it's entirely possible the next global war (God forbid) will involve true \"I'm going to shut off your power grid\" cyber warfare. This is actually a terrifying thought if you consider it seriously, but I think you will see and are seeing more people take this seriously. The more governments take this seriously, the more they will mandate security standards in law, and the migrations involved will require big teams of skilled people.  \nMaybe none of this speaks to your question about pen-testing specifically, but like I said: long-term, the cybersecurity career in general will not go away.",

                  "text": "I'll try to be more precise: I don't think a computer can faithfully emulate a human brain (that's the part covered under \"It's my belief.\") Two separate points here. First, even if it could do it purely theoretically and incredibly slowly, the absolute numbers matter. If simulating a human brain requires the power of 1,000 suns, then that effectively prevents a computer from doing the same things a human can within a Type I civilization on the Kardashev scale. Second, my personal belief is that human cognition isn't strictly computable. I haven't tried to fully formalize this part, but to a first approximation, suppose humans have access to a \"silly goose\" oracle that almost always generates noise, but sometimes generates astonishingly useful bits of information. Say, bits that encode the set of halting TMs. There are conditions you can set on this (I don't have them off the top of my head) that would escape computability, and in my view correspond to the viewpoint that \"humans sometimes have access to true inspiration that can't be understood computably.\"\n\nFor this type of noisy oracle, there is a classic argument that you could repeatedly run the TM+oracle combination until you have enough information to solve the halting problem with 99.999% probability or some such. But, you can't just \"run\" a real human brain a billion times, at least not very quickly, so this doesn't mean would could solve the halting problem in practice. Well, now suppose we find out that this allegedly divine inspiration actually has some kind of actual quantum-mechanical randomness explanation somewhere deep inside neurons that we don't fully understand, but plausibly could understand one day, meaning it's not a true noisy oracle, just a useful but computable heuristic that uses random bits to navigate a massive search space. That still leaves the possibility that to effectively simulate that physical process, we could need enormous computing power we couldn't actually obtain unless we had access to more liquid helium that we could ever harvest on Earth, or some type of yet unknown \"wet computer\" that isn't a human brain but faithfully computes the same physical (hypothetical) process inside neurons that some of us today call \"divine inspiration.\"\n\nI'm sorry this explanation isn't super precise and by its nature difficult to falsify. But there are certainly avenues by which a human brain could seem computable unless you look really, really closely.",

They then claim they use AI as a sales tool, which is seen as a positive by those who don't know how it works. \n\nThe other issue being that technical people/engineers are looking at AI too closely and not from far enough back. They are right that technical expertise probably won't be replaced by AI, at any level, but it doesn't matter if it is or isn't. What matters is how the consumer perceives it. If all these companies keep promoting AI as fixing or optimizing security, most customers don't understand what the limits are, and they make purchasing decisions based on their inaccurate perception. In other words, it doesn't matter how good or bad it is technically, only how people perceive what it is capable of. This goes back decades long before AI and applies to basically every security tool sold since I started, it's just slightly worse now because it's wrapped up in a multi-industry trend. \n\nAI has been sold as a solution to a lot of problems. The customer is buying what is being sold because they don't know differently and are receiving it from a lot of directions. The end result being that pentesters will be replaced by AI, not because AI can do the work, but because there is little accountability for subpar work and using AI makes scaling a lot easier even if the results suck",

But, if I were forced to do the age verification. i might consider the face recognition because honestly, my face is not a secret and you can find it on linkedin or facebook too.

So you give a signature to discord that discord can then turn around and send to a national database that confirms \"this person is above/below the age of 18\" and on the database end all they're seeing is a bunch of random tokens that each represent a person but it's impossible to determine who beyond the limited demographic info that key was made to represent. \n\nAt least that's the implementation you would take if they motive behind this was really just to provide better age verification, and not something more sinister.",
