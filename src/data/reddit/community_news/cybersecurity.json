British MPs are now asking why their due diligence came to such a different conclusion.\n\nSwitzerland chose not to take the risk.\n\nIf a country known for caution and data security decided these risks were unacceptable, what are others seeing differently?What do you think?\n\n[Source](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/war-peace/why-palantir-is-becoming-a-risky-bet-for-switzerland/90666335).",

It started as a set of scripts to tie together a set of isolated databases to achieve the goal of \"Total Information Awareness\". They pushed it to the cloud to ride that wave, but there's no AI in this.  More to the point, though, it allows a malevolent government to outsource domestic surveillance to a private company. That's their value to certain sovereigns; they are a way out of the problem of creating a Stasi w/o it being a government application. ",

Is it just Adobe Reader being weird in VMs (font handling, crash reporting, etc.), or could the file have been tampered with before upload? Or maybe a false positive from how evidence photos get scanned/embedded?\n\nNot claiming it’s malware – just weird that a “simple photo PDF” from official DOJ drops looks like this dynamically. Thoughts?\n\n[Source file](https://filebin.net/5yo5jl18d97uo7uv)",

Instead, it makes use of ordinary WiFi devices already communicating with each other nearby. As radio waves move through a space and interact with people, they create distinctive patterns that can be captured and analyzed. These patterns are comparable to images produced by cameras, but they are formed using radio signals rather than light. The research team argues that this emerging capability highlights the urgent need for stronger privacy protections.",

Still to this very moment, they are trying to \"clear up things that people are getting wrong\" and trying to magically explain away the inherent issues with this whole situation by somehow thinking the fact *AI was used to infer usage pattern is what will reassure people*, and that they'll *\"regain back the users anyways\"* [cit.].\n\nWhether due to incompetence, ignorance, IPO, difference of opinion or malice, it does not matter.

Vehicle intelligence is the perfect example.\n\nYeah, this is probably one of the most scary applications of AI technology. Take every bit of information about browsing activities, cell phone data, marketing information... feed it as much data as you can. Feed it even the stuff that would usually be waaaaay too hard to use. Eventually you'll have very thorough profiles on every person, you'll have unbelievable leverage over them.\n\nThis is what US and Israeli intelligence and some private companies like Palantir are trying to do. They basically want to run something like a SIEM, except the logging is about people and they have the best AI analyzing all the data for them. Scary stuff. Doubly so when you realize just how in bed many of the private companies that have your data are with the US government and just how many of the people working in them are ex-Israeli intelligence.",

So… we’re polishing the same turd, just with a bigger GPU.\n\nWhat I *have not* heard\n\n“Here’s how we get in front of adversaries and make them bleed time/money.”\n\n“Here’s a new defense-in-depth model where hunting is built-in, not a vibes-based afterthought.”\n\n“Here’s how we make attackers’ iteration loop slower than ours.”\n\nInstead it’s: make your silo shinier. Make your dashboard calmer. Make your weekly metrics prettier. (make me look better!)\n\nAnd if you’ve ever been hired to “combat threat actors across the whole company,” you know the brick wall - we all hit it head first\n\nSo the org keeps doing what it can measure today: more triage, better filtering, fancier scoring.\n\nAI could actually break the wall. But breaking walls doesn’t sell as clean as “30% less noise.”\n\nAm I wrong? You know what? F it. I know I'm not wrong.  \nIt's all turd polishing",

Not anything we wanted, but okay cool whatever. \n\nIs anyone getting any real value from AI? I've found the best use case is having it write little tools that are fairly simple, but more effort than I would have put into making them. It breaks as soon as you ask for anything novel though. It's kind of okay for asking questions for new tech you haven't encountered before, but I could have just found an explanation online for 99% of it.

The problem you run into is some vendors don’t retrain enough and over time the model becomes obsolete from an ML perspective.\n\nNow if you mean generative AI, then some of the nicer features I’ve seen are things like “type in your question and our MCP server will build out the query via natural language” which seems to vary greatly based on the vendor.\n\nAlso some of the early functionality that lowers the barrier of entry or allows you to interact with knowledge bases via MCP are nice but nothing insane. \n\nI think you are tired of this hype cycle and it’s justified.

The signal-to-noise ratio on most SIEM alerts is so bad that even a good model just learns to replicate the same fatigue.\n\nWhere I have seen it actually work well is in mobile/application security testing -- specifically in automating the exploratory phase. Dynamic analysis of a mobile app requires navigating through authentication flows, triggering edge cases, testing how the app reacts to a modified environment, and correlating runtime behavior with static findings. That workflow maps well to an agent-based approach because the LLM can reason about what it is observing (e.g. \"the app crashed when I toggled this setting, let me check the logs and try to reproduce with instrumentation\"). The feedback loop is tight and the action space is constrained enough to be useful.\n\nThe actual turd polishing IMO is: AI-generated compliance reports, AI vulnerability descriptions that just rephrase the CVE text, and any product that claims to \"autonomously remediate\" findings by generating code patches. The liability alone makes that a non-starter for anything serious.\n\nThe real question is whether AI gets good enough at reasoning about program behavior to find novel vulnerabilities. Current models can identify known bad patterns, but finding a new logic bug in auth flow requires understanding developer intent vs actual behavior. That is still very much a human skill.",

Initial applications focused on noise reduction and workflow automation; however, current advancements demonstrate strategic superiority. For example, AI-driven deception networks such as Cymmetria or TrapX actively influence attacker decision-making, hence elevating their cost per engagement, an explicit challenge to attacker economics. Likewise, automated red teaming systems (such as Microsoft’s Security Copilot and DARPA’s AI cyber agents) simulate adversarial behavior in real time to predict exploit chains prior to human intervention.  \n  \nCross-silo integration is emerging via AI-enhanced telemetry systems that amalgamate endpoint, identity, and network data, such as Google’s BeyondCorp or AWS’s GuardDuty Correlation Engine, establishing cohesive defensive strategies that actively hinder enemy persistence and lateral movement. AI-augmented malware creation and detection feedback loops are accelerating defenders' iteration cycles faster than many attacker frameworks can adapt.  \n  \nIndeed, a significant portion of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity has focused on metrics-driven operational improvement. However, categorically rejecting the entire domain as “turd polishing” overlooks a significant transformation: the evolution from static automation to autonomous deterrent systems that shift the attacker’s cost curve rather than merely alleviating the analyst’s labor.",

      "text": "I recently started my career as a cybersecurity specialist. Currently, I stay up to date with cybersecurity news mostly via Linkedin and other social media posts, like, if something pops up, I read about it. But I don't feel this is a good way to stay updated. I've bookmarked a few blogs, but still, I dont regularly visit them. I'm seeking for a system that helps me stay updated without me remembering to read a blog everyday.\n\nWhat is your method of staying in the loop? I am not asking for only sources (blogs, youtube, etc.) you seek information from, but, what does an average day in your professional life look like to stay in the loop?\n\nI dont think I did a good job explaining my question, but, thanks in advance for your inputs.",

I also rely on a well curated RSS feed and a few trusted practitioners for analysis instead of headlines.

      "text": "The Feb 16, 2026 standoff between the Department of War (formerly DoD) and Anthropic signals a major escalation. This isn’t a simple contract dispute—it’s the construction of a **federated AI engine** that merges domestic and foreign intelligence, creating unprecedented attack surfaces.\n\n#### 1. The Blueprint: Artificial Intelligence Strategy for the Department of War\nThe Jan 9, 2026 memo [Artificial Intelligence Strategy for the Department of War](https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/12/2003855671/-1/-1/0/ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-STRATEGY-FOR-THE-DEPARTMENT-OF-WAR.PDF) establishes the **Wartime CDAO** with “Barrier Removal Authority,” allowing the legal bypass of any non-statutory privacy or safety protocols. This creates a single point of operational authority over highly sensitive data systems—an obvious **high-value target**.\n\n#### 2. The Mandate: DoD Data Decrees\nPage 4 of the memo centralizes all siloed data across the military into a **federated catalog** for “AI exploitation.” This merging of domestic and foreign intelligence eliminates natural segregation, increasing **insider risk**, **data leakage potential**, and the **blast radius of a compromise**.  \n\n#### 3. The Surveillance Engine: Project Grant (PSP #5)\nProject Grant is designed for **Pattern-of-Life correlation** and real-time predictive intervention. Its deployment means that **compromised models or data flows could allow automated targeting of individuals or infrastructure**, turning AI-driven analysis into a potential vector for **national-scale cyber operations**.\n\n#### 4. Legal Shield: TRUMP AMERICA AI Act (Jan 2026)\nThe Act (Sen. Blackburn) includes **Section 5 Federal Preemption**, eliminating state-level AI privacy protections. By operating on **federal land under NEPA exclusions**, the Department of War effectively removes standard legal oversight, creating **shadow operational networks** that bypass traditional security governance.\n\n#### 5. The Ultimatum: Anthropic as a Supply Chain Risk\nLabeling Anthropic a “supply chain risk” is a warning to all AI labs: **ethical refusal is not permitted**. Only AI models compliant with “all lawful purposes” survive. This **forces a homogenization of AI with zero safety checks**, creating systemic vulnerabilities across critical infrastructure.\n\n**Cybersecurity TL;DR:** The government is deploying a centralized, federated AI system with automatic Pattern-of-Life correlation, legal immunity from oversight, and enforced compliance from private labs. This is not just a privacy issue—it’s a **national-scale cyber risk** with enormous operational attack surfaces.\n\n**Verification Sources:**\n* [Memo Serial 2003855671](https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/12/2003855671/-1/-1/0/ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-STRATEGY-FOR-THE-DEPARTMENT-OF-WAR.PDF)  \n* TRUMP AMERICA AI Act (Jan 2026, Sen.

If so this means that the rest of these ai models likely have ways to jailbreak them into allowing the government to get what they want.\n\n\n\n\nTime to go role-play some ai models.",

Adversaries are trading \"loud\" ransomware for silent, long-term data extortion to stay undetected.\n* **80% of the top ten techniques** are now dedicated to evasion and persistence. If your security controls aren't hunting for **Process Injection (#1 for three years running)**, you're likely blind to persistent malware.\n* Sandbox evasion rose to **#4**. Modern malware like **LummaC2** now uses **trigonometry** to calculate the Euclidean distance of mouse movements to prove a human is present before execution.\n\n**Participants:**\n\n* **Dr. Suleyman Ozarslan**, Co-founder and VP of Picus Labs ([u/malware\\_bender](https://www.reddit.com/user/malware_bender/))\n* **Sıla Ozeren Hacioglu**, Security Research Engineer ([u/sila-ozeren](https://www.reddit.com/user/sila-ozeren/))\n* **Huseyin Can Yuceel**, Research Lead ([u/hcyuceel\\_picus](https://www.reddit.com/user/hcyuceel_picus/))\n\n[Proof Photos](https://imgur.com/a/jeKFo9a)\n\nWe'll be here on February 19, 2026, answering your questions.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* [Red Report 2026](https://7048931.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/7048931/Picus-RedReport2026.pdf)",

              "text": "**TL;DR:** Trigonometry isn’t required for malware to run, but it’s a clever anti-analysis upgrade that makes sandbox evasion much harder to fake by verifying realistic human behavior before dropping the payload.  \n  \nHi!! I would be overstating it if I said malware needs math to escape virtualization environments or sandboxes :)). What we are seeing now is that some families are starting to use trigonometry and similar calculations to make user-activity checks more granular and harder to mimic.\n\nWe are all familiar with the classic sandbox evasion tricks (I am pretty sure many of you have seen them before): checking for VM artifacts, looking at suspicious process names, validating system uptime, inspecting user directories, or simply waiting for basic mouse movement. *That part isn’t new.* The difference is the refinement. Instead of checking for movement, it checks for believable movement. It’s not about math for the sake of math, it’s just making sandbox evasion harder to realistically fake :)).\n\nHere is how LummaC2 executed this technique.\n\nThe malware repeatedly queries Windows for the cursor position using the `GetCursorPos()` function. It waits until the cursor moves at least once. Then, within a short time window, it records several cursor positions in sequence, pausing briefly between each check.\n\nEach recorded position is simply an `(x, y) coordinate` on the screen. When two consecutive points are connected, they form a line segment. The malware calculates the length of that segment using the standard `Euclidean distance formula` used to measure the distance between two points on a graph:\n\n`√((x₂ − x₁)² + (y₂ − y₁)²)`\n\nIt then calculates the angle between consecutive movement vectors using the dot product formula:\n\n`cos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A||B|)`\n\nThe resulting angle is converted to degrees and compared against a hardcoded threshold. If the directional changes between movement segments are small and consistent, the motion is considered smooth and human-like. If the angles are sharp or inconsistent, it suggests scripted or synthetic input.\n\nAutomated sandboxes often generate straight-line or low-complexity cursor paths. Human motion, even when attempting to move in a straight line, naturally contains micro-curves and gradual directional transitions. By mathematically evaluating curvature and smoothness, LummaC2 effectively adds a probabilistic filter to determine whether it is operating in a real user environment.\n\nSorry for the long reply!! :)",

As you pointed out in RR26, attackers have continued to rely heavily on infostealers in 2025 as well.\n\nThe strategy shift is pretty clear. Instead of encrypting everything and going straight to a ransom demand, many actors are staying inside the environment, quietly exfiltrating targeted data, and coming back with solid proof of theft as leverage. With that model working so well for them, we’ll likely keep seeing infostealers play a major role.",

Signature-based detection has always been effective when the artifact is stable and observable.\n\nThe challenge, as the report points out, is that modern malware activity increasingly prioritizes evasion and persistence over traditional payload delivery (with 80% of the top 10 now focusing on stealth, it is safe to say we are facing a **stealth epidemic** right now).\n\nTechniques like process injection, defense impairment, credential abuse (observed in 1 out of every 4 malware samples), and cloud/API misuse for stealthy data exfiltration, not to mention that 19% of malware now relies on application-layer protocols, *do not always leave static artifacts* that file-based rules can reliably match. \n\nBecause of that shift, relying *primarily* on YARA-style matching creates visibility gaps.\n\nRR26’s key findings favor a behavior-centric model, with a strong emphasis on *continuous validation*. It is not just about detecting techniques rather than samples or incorporating memory and identity telemetry, but about systematically and repeatedly validating implemented security controls against the most prevalent TTPs to clearly identify where they fail. That continuous validation component is critical, as it ensures defenses are not assumed to work but are actively proven against real-world adversary behavior.\n\nSo it is *less about YARA being obsolete* and more about it *being insufficient as a standalone practice* in the current threat landscape.",

You know, by intentionally manipulating environmental artifacts or user-activity signals (*creating a perfect honeypot*), defenders can fingerprint malware, force it into dormancy, or route it into deeper analysis.",

Quick edits, log file reviews, config cleanup. It's just been part of the workflow.\n\nThey're pushing VS Code as the approved alternative but honestly it feels like overkill for quick text edits. Takes longer to load, more resource heavy. Just need something simple for day-to-day stuff.\n\nFor those who already made the switch - what are you using now that's actually comparable? Need something lightweight that doesn't slow down basic tasks.\n\nAny suggestions?",

What is the target context of the remote code execution?\n\nThe malicious code would execute in the security context of the user who opened the Markdown file, giving the attacker the same permissions as that user.\n```",

Hopefully your company has good documentation, if they already have established SOC playbooks, SOPs, etc, start by reviewing those. You should at least know which playbook to execute when. Build the bigger picture from there with your team's Security Incident Response plan, and then your company's overall Incident Response plan.\n\nYour manager probably has specific skills that he will want you to develop, maybe even a whole training plan already created. If he leaves it open to you, there's really two paths you can choose. Hands-on virtual labs like Let's Defend or THM/HTB SOC learning paths. Or traditional certifications that might be a mix of labs and lecture like CySA+, BTL1, or SC-200 (if you are a Microsoft shop).",

Whether or not it's worth the trade-off, well that's probably more personal. Fast charging and a small battery pack, achieve a similar goal as having extra batteries to be swapped.  \nIn a security sense, I'm sure this sucks quite a bit. But, there's more to the story.  \nI sure as shit wouldn't want these mass produced things going to the dump just because of a little water. So, unfortunately, this isn't necessarily a bad thing either.  \nNot everyone bothered with the battery replacements; at least that wouldn't take one of the current phones in to have it done.\n\nBecause we don't really control where these devices are built since it's often in countries like China. It has gotten to the point on a hardware security level that Apple won't allow an exact battery, swapped from another brand new phone.  \nThis sounds horrible, because for a corporation like Apple it pretty much is.  \nBut, this implies they are taking action against attacks on the supply chain.\n\nSo, these things are double edge swords unfortunately.\n\nWhat kind of security do we want?  \nEspecially considering a direct attack, via the LTE chip or otherwise is nothing in comparison to implanted hardware somewhere along the supply chain.  \nWhich has certainly been reported. Thankfully, not for main brand phones.\n\nBut, heck I believe this sort of thing impacted cisco switches, so what is even the concern of the phones..",
