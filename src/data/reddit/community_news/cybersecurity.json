British MPs are now asking why their due diligence came to such a different conclusion.\n\nSwitzerland chose not to take the risk.\n\nIf a country known for caution and data security decided these risks were unacceptable, what are others seeing differently?What do you think?\n\n[Source](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/war-peace/why-palantir-is-becoming-a-risky-bet-for-switzerland/90666335).",

Is it just Adobe Reader being weird in VMs (font handling, crash reporting, etc.), or could the file have been tampered with before upload? Or maybe a false positive from how evidence photos get scanned/embedded?\n\nNot claiming it’s malware – just weird that a “simple photo PDF” from official DOJ drops looks like this dynamically. Thoughts?\n\n[Source file](https://filebin.net/5yo5jl18d97uo7uv)",

          "text": "\"Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter aircraft can be jailbroken \"just like an iPhone,\" the Netherlands' defense secretary has claimed. Gijs Tuinman made the comments during a podcast interview after being asked whether the aircraft's software could be modified by European forces without permission from the US should it withdraw as an ally.\n\n\"The F-35 is truly a shared product,\" Tuinman told BNR's Boekestijn en De Wijk show (translated from Dutch). \"The British make the Rolls-Royce engines, and the Americans simply need them too. And even if this mutual dependency doesn't result in software updates, the F-35, in its current state, is still a better aircraft than other types of fighters.\"\n\n\"If you still want to upgrade despite everything, I'm going to say something I should never say, but I will anyway: you can jailbreak an F-35 just like an iPhone.\"\n\nTuinman did not elaborate on what he meant by this, but his comments suggest that European forces currently managing a fleet of F-35s would be capable of maintaining their aircraft's software, with or without the help of US manufacturer Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe Register contacted the aerospace engineering company for its take on Tuinman's words, but it referred us to the US government, which did not immediately reply.\n\nOne person who has experience in tinkering with aircraft tech is Ken Munro, whose company Pen Test Partners has poked under the hood of commercial planes many times.\n\nHe told us that while he was not familiar with the F-35 specifically, Tuinman's comments and what the Dutch defense secretary implied did not surprise him. However, without physical access to a fighter jet, the chance of a jailbreak becoming public knowledge is highly unlikely.\n\n\"Unlike consumer devices, such as the iPhone, which is easily accessed by the research community, and therefore subject to their 'attention,' one can't go buy an F-35 on eBay,\" he said.\n\n\"The barrier to entry for researchers and hackers is simply too high for military hardware. Hence, we rely on defense contractors getting security right the first time. That lack of a community doing its own research means that accidental and unintentional security issues aren't likely to be as easily found. Indeed, innovative attacks aren't likely to be carried out, as researchers can't access the required hardware.\"\n\n\"There is also a commercial motivation to discovering jailbreaks on consumer devices such as the iPhone.\"\n\nAnother reason why jailbreaking an F-35 won't be nearly as easy as commercial gadgets is the way in which its software is managed.\n\nAccording to a video published by Lockheed Martin in 2017, the F-35 Lightning II is updated through the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS).\n\nALIS has several applications devoted to various fleet management tasks, as well as for accessing an aircraft's technical data. Updates are delivered through service packs, much like any other major software update, every year or two.\n\nIsrael is the only country to have negotiated a deal with Lockheed Martin, allowing it to run its own software on its F-35I fleet.\n\nTuinman's comments come nearly a year after Joachim Schranzhofer, head of comms at German defense contractor Hensoldt, stoked fears that the US could remotely disable all European fleets.\n\nSpeaking to Bild, within the context of the US pausing military aid to Ukraine – to which it supplied F-16 aircraft – Schranzhofer said the idea of a remote \"kill switch\" was \"more than just a rumor.\"\n\nAt the time, wider fears of the US's power over F-35 aircraft and their updates spread across Europe.\n\nPortugal had already announced that its procurement plans for F-35s had been dropped following US political concerns, while Tussell data showed the UK's defense budget was being directed ever closer to Europe and away from the US.\"",

Feed it even the stuff that would usually be waaaaay too hard to use. Eventually you'll have very thorough profiles on every person, you'll have unbelievable leverage over them.\n\nThis is what US and Israeli intelligence and some private companies like Palantir are trying to do. They basically want to run something like a SIEM, except the logging is about people and they have the best AI analyzing all the data for them. Scary stuff.

That's why the story is being covered up and partly why VIPs aren't being arrested. \n\nFor some basic background: Ehud Barak co-founded cyber intelligence company Toka, with retired IDF cyber chief, Brig. Gen. Yaron Rosen. \n\nEhud Barak had his own apartment on the 11th floor of 301 East 66th st. - Jeffrey Epstein's notorious townhouse.  The building was 1st owned by Leslie Wexner and also owned by Jeffrey Epstein's brother Mark. Ehud Barak and his bodyguards were seen regularly in the building. \n\nAround 2015 Epstein needed a favor from his high up Russian agent source named Belyakov, in return Epstein promised to help by linking them with Ehud Barak, and other VIPs. \n\n\"Epstein's end of the deal was recruiting Western elites to Putin's forums.\n\nHe promised to bring LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, Microsoft's Nathan Myhrvold, billionaire Thomas Pritzker, and former Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak.\"      Source: https://www.kyivpost.com/post/65602?\n\nArchived (free) link to Haaretz article: https://archive.ph/20260217155625/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2026-02-16/ty-article-magazine/.premium/your-car-is-spying-on-you-and-israeli-firms-are-leading-the-surveillance-race/0000019c-6651-d2f0-a19c-7fdd81920000",

I'm seeking for a system that helps me stay updated without me remembering to read a blog everyday.\n\nWhat is your method of staying in the loop?

Then prompted claude to create the following:\n\nDprk bot:\nI had claude create a bot that would \n1. poll my bluesky feed every hour for new intel report links (found bluesky was way better than X for this)\n2. extract IOCs \n3. list the threat actor \n4. List the campaign \n5. List the techniques used\n6. Map them to mitre’s attack framework\n7. Push to dprk discord channel\n8. Push to notion (claude can connect and create the pages/database or you can do it yourself)\n\n\nGeneral threat intel bot:\n1. Connect to my feedly account\n2. Look at any article marked unread\n3. Analyze them and mark them as read afterwards\n4. Group them by ctitical vulnerabilities, active campaigns, new tools and techniques, and “worth reading”\n5. Push to my discord “general intel” channel with links\n\nFew other bots i had it create was a cve tracker. then created a discord bot that i send slash commands to with a specific cve and it searches and monitors for public POCs, nuclei templates, information, whether its being actively exploited, etc and pushes that info to notion with links\n\nAd hoc discord bot that i feed ad hoc report links and gives me the same info as the DPRK bot.\n\nThis has worked great for me to get a grasp on the crazy amount of information I have to ingest daily and the cost for the ongoing use of claude comes out to like 4 bucks a month or some shit. Deffinately worth it. Small investment up front but likely to pay dividends in the long run if it helps you in your career.",

      "text": "The Feb 16, 2026 standoff between the Department of War (formerly DoD) and Anthropic signals a major escalation. This isn’t a simple contract dispute—it’s the construction of a **federated AI engine** that merges domestic and foreign intelligence, creating unprecedented attack surfaces.\n\n#### 1. The Blueprint: Artificial Intelligence Strategy for the Department of War\nThe Jan 9, 2026 memo [Artificial Intelligence Strategy for the Department of War](https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/12/2003855671/-1/-1/0/ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-STRATEGY-FOR-THE-DEPARTMENT-OF-WAR.PDF) establishes the **Wartime CDAO** with “Barrier Removal Authority,” allowing the legal bypass of any non-statutory privacy or safety protocols. This creates a single point of operational authority over highly sensitive data systems—an obvious **high-value target**.\n\n#### 2. The Mandate: DoD Data Decrees\nPage 4 of the memo centralizes all siloed data across the military into a **federated catalog** for “AI exploitation.” This merging of domestic and foreign intelligence eliminates natural segregation, increasing **insider risk**, **data leakage potential**, and the **blast radius of a compromise**.  \n\n#### 3. The Surveillance Engine: Project Grant (PSP #5)\nProject Grant is designed for **Pattern-of-Life correlation** and real-time predictive intervention. Its deployment means that **compromised models or data flows could allow automated targeting of individuals or infrastructure**, turning AI-driven analysis into a potential vector for **national-scale cyber operations**.\n\n#### 4. Legal Shield: TRUMP AMERICA AI Act (Jan 2026)\nThe Act (Sen. Blackburn) includes **Section 5 Federal Preemption**, eliminating state-level AI privacy protections. By operating on **federal land under NEPA exclusions**, the Department of War effectively removes standard legal oversight, creating **shadow operational networks** that bypass traditional security governance.\n\n#### 5. The Ultimatum: Anthropic as a Supply Chain Risk\nLabeling Anthropic a “supply chain risk” is a warning to all AI labs: **ethical refusal is not permitted**. Only AI models compliant with “all lawful purposes” survive. This **forces a homogenization of AI with zero safety checks**, creating systemic vulnerabilities across critical infrastructure.\n\n**Cybersecurity TL;DR:** The government is deploying a centralized, federated AI system with automatic Pattern-of-Life correlation, legal immunity from oversight, and enforced compliance from private labs. This is not just a privacy issue—it’s a **national-scale cyber risk** with enormous operational attack surfaces.\n\n**Verification Sources:**\n* [Memo Serial 2003855671](https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/12/2003855671/-1/-1/0/ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-STRATEGY-FOR-THE-DEPARTMENT-OF-WAR.PDF)  \n* TRUMP AMERICA AI Act (Jan 2026, Sen.

Adversaries are trading \"loud\" ransomware for silent, long-term data extortion to stay undetected.\n* **80% of the top ten techniques** are now dedicated to evasion and persistence. If your security controls aren't hunting for **Process Injection (#1 for three years running)**, you're likely blind to persistent malware.\n* Sandbox evasion rose to **#4**. Modern malware like **LummaC2** now uses **trigonometry** to calculate the Euclidean distance of mouse movements to prove a human is present before execution.\n\n**Participants:**\n\n* **Dr. Suleyman Ozarslan**, Co-founder and VP of Picus Labs ([u/malware\\_bender](https://www.reddit.com/user/malware_bender/))\n* **Sıla Ozeren Hacioglu**, Security Research Engineer ([u/sila-ozeren](https://www.reddit.com/user/sila-ozeren/))\n* **Huseyin Can Yuceel**, Research Lead ([u/hcyuceel\\_picus](https://www.reddit.com/user/hcyuceel_picus/))\n\n[Proof Photos](https://imgur.com/a/jeKFo9a)\n\nWe'll be here on February 19, 2026, answering your questions.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* [Red Report 2026](https://7048931.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/7048931/Picus-RedReport2026.pdf)",

              "text": "**TL;DR:** Trigonometry isn’t required for malware to run, but it’s a clever anti-analysis upgrade that makes sandbox evasion much harder to fake by verifying realistic human behavior before dropping the payload.  \n  \nHi!! I would be overstating it if I said malware needs math to escape virtualization environments or sandboxes :)). What we are seeing now is that some families are starting to use trigonometry and similar calculations to make user-activity checks more granular and harder to mimic.\n\nWe are all familiar with the classic sandbox evasion tricks (I am pretty sure many of you have seen them before): checking for VM artifacts, looking at suspicious process names, validating system uptime, inspecting user directories, or simply waiting for basic mouse movement. *That part isn’t new.* The difference is the refinement. Instead of checking for movement, it checks for believable movement. It’s not about math for the sake of math, it’s just making sandbox evasion harder to realistically fake :)).\n\nHere is how LummaC2 executed this technique.\n\nThe malware repeatedly queries Windows for the cursor position using the `GetCursorPos()` function. It waits until the cursor moves at least once. Then, within a short time window, it records several cursor positions in sequence, pausing briefly between each check.\n\nEach recorded position is simply an `(x, y) coordinate` on the screen. When two consecutive points are connected, they form a line segment. The malware calculates the length of that segment using the standard `Euclidean distance formula` used to measure the distance between two points on a graph:\n\n`√((x₂ − x₁)² + (y₂ − y₁)²)`\n\nIt then calculates the angle between consecutive movement vectors using the dot product formula:\n\n`cos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A||B|)`\n\nThe resulting angle is converted to degrees and compared against a hardcoded threshold. If the directional changes between movement segments are small and consistent, the motion is considered smooth and human-like. If the angles are sharp or inconsistent, it suggests scripted or synthetic input.\n\nAutomated sandboxes often generate straight-line or low-complexity cursor paths. Human motion, even when attempting to move in a straight line, naturally contains micro-curves and gradual directional transitions. By mathematically evaluating curvature and smoothness, LummaC2 effectively adds a probabilistic filter to determine whether it is operating in a real user environment.\n\nSorry for the long reply!! :)",

As you pointed out in RR26, attackers have continued to rely heavily on infostealers in 2025 as well.\n\nThe strategy shift is pretty clear. Instead of encrypting everything and going straight to a ransom demand, many actors are staying inside the environment, quietly exfiltrating targeted data, and coming back with solid proof of theft as leverage. With that model working so well for them, we’ll likely keep seeing infostealers play a major role.",

Signature-based detection has always been effective when the artifact is stable and observable.\n\nThe challenge, as the report points out, is that modern malware activity increasingly prioritizes evasion and persistence over traditional payload delivery (with 80% of the top 10 now focusing on stealth, it is safe to say we are facing a **stealth epidemic** right now).\n\nTechniques like process injection, defense impairment, credential abuse (observed in 1 out of every 4 malware samples), and cloud/API misuse for stealthy data exfiltration, not to mention that 19% of malware now relies on application-layer protocols, *do not always leave static artifacts* that file-based rules can reliably match. \n\nBecause of that shift, relying *primarily* on YARA-style matching creates visibility gaps.\n\nRR26’s key findings favor a behavior-centric model, with a strong emphasis on *continuous validation*. It is not just about detecting techniques rather than samples or incorporating memory and identity telemetry, but about systematically and repeatedly validating implemented security controls against the most prevalent TTPs to clearly identify where they fail. That continuous validation component is critical, as it ensures defenses are not assumed to work but are actively proven against real-world adversary behavior.\n\nSo it is *less about YARA being obsolete* and more about it *being insufficient as a standalone practice* in the current threat landscape.",

As a result, many organizations strengthened their backup strategies and resilience, especially those that implemented proper segmentation :)). In many cases, the traditional ransomware business model became less effective.\n\nNow, it is often more profitable to remain inside the environment than to disrupt it. Instead of taking everything at once, attackers increasingly extract **small amounts of high-value data** over time while staying under the radar. Once they have gathered enough, they return with **proof of access** such as specific files, records, or samples, and use the threat of public exposure as leverage.\n\nDon't get me wrong, encryption can still occur, but it is frequently no longer the first step. :)",

Many attackers now prioritize stealing sensitive information and extorting victims by threatening to leak it, without necessarily encrypting systems.

Then hold a conversation with the moderators until they felt comfortable letting you in. The user registration had to be manually approved by the moderators.\n\nSo many spam bots were stopped at the registration page because they would immediately spam when the only people who could see their post was themselves and the moderators; no one else. Regular users couldn't see who was allowed or blocked, and the blocked users' subsequent posts in the registration page were ignored by mods sorta like Reddit's shadow ban mechanism.\n\nWe banned a couple toxic people who lost their patience at our lengthy review timeline (because we were all volunteers doing this on our free time) and insulted us, ensuring that they never met the rest of the website users. I recall one seemly passed the sniff test, only to be banned by the admin because the admin recognized that person (I think it was their email address?) had been trolling on other websites and he was friends with those website owners.\n\nIf that website was still running today, almost none of its content would be in the LLMs' databases as all of the AI agents would have ran straight into the registration wall, unless a registered user scraped it themselves.\n\nIt would be a serious whiplash to see websites return to that gated entry method to avoid the flood of automated web scraping.",

There are also plans to create a mobile app in a couple of months. So when I got the job they didn’t specify my role exactly, they just told me that I’d be cybersecurity guy. I’m also the only security guy. I asked for access to everything (code and AWS credentials) so that I can be like an Application Security Engineer/ DevSecOps, but they don’t want that. They just want me to just test their security from what’s visible on the outside. I used to work as a pentester in my previous company, which was basically a contracting firm. We would get short term contracts to pentest the network, cloud and applications of various companies. The engagements lasted like a month and was done mostly once a year for each company. So now I have a full time role at this startup and they want me to do pentesting, which I think takes just a few weeks then I’ll be free for some time till they fix the issues I found or add new features and I have to retest. This means I’ll have a lot of free time on my hands. So I wanted advice from this sub on what I should do on my company time or just the best advice in this situation. I’m fairly new to cybersecurity with just 2 years experience in pentesting\n\nTLDR; I’m the only security person at a startup. They don’t want to give me code access or AWS access. I expect pentesting will take a few weeks, leaving me with downtime while waiting for fixes and retests. With \\~2 years of pentesting experience, what should I focus on during that time to provide the most long-term value? Or what other advice would you give me?",

It’s not that they don’t care, it’s that if they don’t sell, the company might not exist long enough for perfect security to matter. A lot of companies harden things later when enterprise deals or compliance become a blocker.\n\nIf they just want external testing, do that well. With your downtime, build a lightweight roadmap toward something like SOC 2 or basic compliance readiness. Map gaps, outline phases, define quick wins like IAM hygiene, logging, backups, and basic policies.\n\nThat shifts you from potentially turning into “the pentest guy” to them thinking of you like their CISO.",

Security is typically an afterthought because \"nothing has happened yet\" which necessarily frames your job as preventative (except for in the case of red teaming where there is a bit more salient urgency) rather than something which will profit the company directly. Framing things this way shifts the mindset of people who don't think in the same way you do. To this end you can also begin framing any changes or processes as a path toward various certifications (SOC, ISO, Etc.) Which can have a direct relationship to company profit by opening up the TAM for the company quite a bit.\n\nHope this helps!",

Think vulnerability management process, incident response playbook, security awareness training. These are things they’ll eventually need, especially if they want enterprise customers or go through SOC 2, and right now nobody is doing them.\nOn the access issue, push back on this professionally. Not having code access as the only security person is genuinely limiting. You can’t do threat modeling, you can’t catch vulns before they ship, you can’t bake security into the CI/CD pipeline. Frame it as “I can find bugs after the fact or I can help prevent them from being introduced in the first place.” The second option saves them money. With the mobile app coming in a few months that’s a good opportunity to get involved earlier and propose being part of the process from the start.\nUse the free time to skill up too. AWS security specifically since that’s what they’re running on, AppSec tooling like SAST/DAST/SCA, maybe start studying for AWS Security Specialty or OSCP if you don’t have it yet. Two years in pentesting is a solid base but startups reward people who can wear multiple hats.",

Don't fight it. Not yet. You're new, they don't know you, and honestly? That's fine. Earn it. Do brilliant work with what you've got, present your findings in a way that actually helps the devs rather than just dropping a scary report on their desk, and watch what happens. That access conversation comes back around on its own once they see you're not just ticking boxes. Pushing for it now when you've barely started will just make people nervous.\n\nThe downtime thing. Ok this is where it gets interesting because most people would see this as a problem and it's actually the biggest opportunity you're going to get.\n\nHere's what I've learned about startups. Nobody is coming to give you a roadmap. Nobody is going to tap you on the shoulder and say \"hey here's what you should do next.\" That's not how it works. You either figure out where the gaps are and fill them, or you sit around waiting for instructions that never come. One of those people gets promoted. The other one gets made redundant at the next funding crunch.\n\nSo use that time. Talk to the devs. Talk to the founders. Understand what's actually being built and where it's heading. If there's a mobile app coming in a couple months, go figure out what that means for your work and come back with a simple one pager. Nothing fancy. Just \"here's what I think we should be thinking about.\" That one document will change how they see you overnight. You go from \"pentest guy\" to someone they actually want in the room when decisions get made.\n\nYour job title means nothing at this stage. Genuinely. It becomes whatever you make it. And you've got a real shot at building something way bigger than what you were hired for.\n\nDon't waste it 🏴‍☠️",

          "text": "Since they mentioned a mobile app is coming in a few months, that is where I would invest your downtime. Start building your mobile security testing methodology now so you are ready when it ships. Get comfortable with the OWASP MAS project -- specifically the MASVS for defining what to test and the MASTG for the actual testing procedures. Set up an Android testing environment with a rooted device or emulator, install Frida and objection, and practice on intentionally vulnerable apps like DIVA or InsecureBankv2. When the mobile app does land, you will want to cover the full surface: decompile the APK with jadx to review hardcoded secrets and API endpoints, test for certificate pinning (or the lack of it), check how they handle token storage (SharedPreferences vs EncryptedSharedPreferences vs the Android Keystore), and verify root/jailbreak detection if applicable. Most startups ship their first mobile app with almost no security controls, so you will likely find plenty to report. If you can demonstrate that value early, that is also your leverage to argue for code access and a proper AppSec role down the line.",

Right now you're doing point-in-time testing, but what the business actually needs is continuous visibility into their exposure.\n\n  \nStart simple:\n\n\\- Run external scans of your attack surface weekly. Know what's exposed before someone else finds it.\n\n\\- Build a basic asset inventory. You can't secure what you don't know about.\n\n\\- Track every finding somewhere — even a spreadsheet — just make sure nothing falls through the cracks between pentests.\n\n  \nOn the access issue, push back on it professionally. Frame it as: \"I can find maybe 20% of the issues from the outside, or 80% with read access to the code and infrastructure. Which would you prefer?\" Most startups come around once they see the first pentest report and realize how much faster you could have caught those issues with visibility.\n\n  \nAnd if there's a mobile app coming in a few months, now is the time to write down your security requirements for it. Getting those in front of the dev team before they write code is worth more than any pentest after the fact.",

Hopefully your company has good documentation, if they already have established SOC playbooks, SOPs, etc, start by reviewing those. You should at least know which playbook to execute when. Build the bigger picture from there with your team's Security Incident Response plan, and then your company's overall Incident Response plan.\n\nYour manager probably has specific skills that he will want you to develop, maybe even a whole training plan already created. If he leaves it open to you, there's really two paths you can choose. Hands-on virtual labs like Let's Defend or THM/HTB SOC learning paths. Or traditional certifications that might be a mix of labs and lecture like CySA+, BTL1, or SC-200 (if you are a Microsoft shop).",

NSO maintained zero-click exploit chains for both iOS and Android simultaneously for years, which means they had persistent access to vulnerabilities in the most heavily audited codebases on the planet.\n\nFrom a defensive standpoint, the hard lesson is that traditional endpoint security does not work on mobile. You cannot install a kernel-level EDR on a locked-down iOS device. The detection methods that actually caught Pegasus infections -- like Amnesty International's Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) -- work by analyzing forensic artifacts after the fact: anomalous process names, suspicious iCloud backup metadata, and known indicator domains in network logs.\n\nFor anyone doing mobile security assessments, the takeaway is not \"you cannot defend against nation-state tools\" -- it is that your app-level protections (certificate pinning, runtime integrity checks, jailbreak detection) are the actual front line, because the OS-level guarantees might already be compromised. Defense in depth at the application layer matters more on mobile than anywhere else.",
