Also, doesn't sound like there's going to be any formal seating, so have fun holding your laptop up while you're standing in a crowd. \n\nMy real answer: they probably don't want any amateurs being disruptive with electronic devices there that they can't track down. Normal cell phones can be tracked and identified. They could never stop an actual attacker with proper covert gear, but they can stop a bunch of children from DoS'ing equipment and being annoying.",

The political atmosphere around this election was charged to say the least, and it stands to reason that Mamdani’s inauguration could be a more interesting target for disruption than others. From the perspective of a naïve event coordinator, banning devices like F0 takes little effort and appears to have the effect of removing a large amount of possible disruptions, regardless of the reality that almost no one in any random crowd of 10,000 would ever have such a device with them. Unfortunately, like you said, it also doesn’t stop someone with actual ill intent.",

E.g., while you might run a little home lab or mini K8s server at home on your RPi, there's very few reasons you would need to bring a RPi with you into a convention center for a political event.",

It is questionable to claim it validated a continental system collapse.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. has been using similar electrical system blackouts in similar situations since at least the Korean War. Forcing air defense and other adversary forces to switch off the main grid has numerous advantages to the attacker. I don’t have any evidence that anything nuclear nor exotic was used in Caracas.

It's often easier to simply walk into substations and destroy some capacitors.\n\nI've traditionally interpreted claims like this more as a PR stunt to sow FUD. It is theoretically possible, but low probability and likely not the most effective tool at your disposal if you're actually seeking to cause a blackout. What if the cyber attack had failed? Why not use the military to walk in and trigger the isolators, or blow it up? Kinetic options were definitely on the table here!",

      "text": "I've spent the last decade in incident response, working across everything from 5-person joinery shops to multi-national retail enterprises. After cleaning up roughly 1,000 incidents, I naturally developed a bit of an intuition for knowing the difference between \"good security\" and \"good control coverage\".\n\nThe firms that survive incidents (and prevent them) are almost never the ones with the most tools or the biggest budgets. They were the ones who understood their resilience - where they'd actually break under pressure, and what that would cost them.\n\nA few things I've learned that changed how I approach assessments:\n\n**1. Compliance framing creates false confidence**\n\nCyber Essentials, SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc - you must understand that their sole purpose is to make it easier to do business with other companies. Executives sponsor these programmes because it will make them more money.\n\nThat might be by making their onboarding quicker, or shortening deal cycles when responding to RFPs, or just increasing consumer confidence.\n\nNone of it actually helps an organisation be more secure. At the best, I think it's fair to say that there's a small correlation between certifications and resilience, but it's absolutely not a casual relationship, just a pattern.\n\n**2. Clients respond to money, not maturity scores**\n\nNobody outside of security knows what \"Level 3 maturity\" means. But say \"you have a high insolvency risk from a major incident\" and suddenly you've got board-level attention. I frame all my assessments this way, even for small businesses.\n\nThe key principle to consider is that security programmes cost money. And for any commercial venture, money MUST provide a return on investment. If your recommendations don't make your client more money then they cost, why would they do it? I've known many enterprises that simply accept that they will have a major incident every 1-2 years, because the cost of transforming their security architecture would cost more than the impact of the incidents.\n\nThis is a totally valid position! And if you can help your client weigh up exactly what the pros and cons are, then you will quickly become one of their most trusted and valuable partners.\n\nThe trick, of course, is having the data and vocabulary to model the commercial implications.\n\n**3. The \"time to low risk\" metric changes the conversation**\n\nExecutive audiences don't understand CVSS scores, and are not going to read your 47 technical findings. Include them for context and for technical readers, but stick them in an appendix, and instead, lead with the programme required to get from their current state into an acceptable state.\n\nHow many months will it take? How much will it cost? Who will do the work? How do they measure success?\n\nThis completely changes the conversation, and transforms a scary report into an actionable project plan that your client will have confidence in sponsoring. You want your client to feel like they've been handed a solution, not a problem.\n\n**4. Periphery systems are where organisations actually die**\n\nCore infrastructure is usually fine - everyone's got M365, EDR, and MFA on their main systems now. If they've put one iota of effort into changing the defaults or have an MSP that does this for them, by and large they are in a great position.\n\nThe reason organisations like this still get hacked is because of the exceptions. Machines that don't have DfE on. Servers that have been missed from your asset register. An SSL VPN that no-one knew about.\n\nFixing these are often quick wins. Migrating might be a pain, but it's ultimately a short programme of work with a high reduction in risk.\n\n\\----\n\nI've put together a sample report that captures everything I've discussed above with a fictitious client. Here's the link: [https://analystengine.io/msp-assessment-sample](https://analystengine.io/msp-assessment-sample)\n\n**Transparent disclosure:** The site above does link to my cybersecurity startup focused on generating content like the above. That being said, the link above contains no CTA or sales material. I'm making the sample freely available as a resource for others to use how they see fit - and have added the required corporate flair to this post.\n\nI would love any advice or feedback on the report structure if anyone has thoughts on how to improve it!\n\n\\----\n\nEDIT: Overwhelmed with all the support this post got! For those asking for follow-up materials and my playbook for delivering cybersecurity assessments, I've typed it all up here: [How to deliver cybersecurity assessments](https://www.analystengine.io/how-to-deliver-cybersecurity-assessments?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=cybersecurity)\n\nI've included lots of resources, including the sample questionnaire I use for all new engagements, and a checklist of items to go through during your technical interviews.

Some enterprises really want to be more secure, in which case GRC efforts provide a roadmap and a yardstick for measuring progress. What most enterprises wish for, however, is a checkmark as a sales qualification, so they can sell into specific markets where security is a concern. For example, I can't tell you how many companies might say, \"We'll buy from you, but you need your SOC 2\" for enterprises where a SOC 2 isn't even appropriate, or they don't understand the difference between a SOC 2 Type I and II. Still, they will take a well-documented list of security controls over adequate security.",

I agree on the SDLC front, but I included it in the sample because if a company does do it they always request it and I wanted to evidence that we do capture this. If you read the business context section of the executive summary, there is reference to the fact that ACME develops a small internal portal. But I agree that this will apply to very few SMBs.\n\nIf you take just the Overview sections (exec summary, compliance status, recommendations), would you find that more condensed? The only people I would expect to read further than that are technical people who need to action specific findings.",

Most of the time the SMB is just the owner that doesnt really know what to do, so they hire the MSP to do this stuff. So, if the context is that you are the MSP doing a security evaluation, then a lot of this seems kinda unnecessary. Like, you are reporting to the owner on your own security work, etc. - and that could be drastically summarized in my opinion.   \nOtherwise, I'd ask who is this meant for? An IT manager, the owner? or the MSP if you are just the external security evaluator/auditor?    \nWhat is the high level overview of the findings, and some details on each category evaluated - then maybe some technical stuff to help guide whoever might actually implement changes/fixes. The rest seems like fluff that I wouldn't expect anyone to read and seems to bog down the report.",

I can tell you what services you provide and how they compare to what your competitors are doing. But risk is not addressed by NIST CSF.\n\nClient: So what have I paid for then?!\n\nThe security domains I've included in this sample (SecOps, Resilience, Growth) are all aligned/mapped to NIST in the backend. But especially for the SMB audience where the buyer is a little less mature, I think it's important we can go beyond service maturity and actually present improvement roadmaps aligned to risk - because really that's what they care about.\n\nPeople may disagree on that, and that's fair.

And if you tell them that 2-3 incidents a year costs the company $5 and an investment of $10 would reduce that annual cost to $2... there's a strong argument for them to say \"Let's wait a few years\".  \n  \nAll I am really saying is you will get more achieved and further your agenda better if you work within this way of thinking. CEOs and CFOs hate it when security feels like it's a sunken cost.",

We should be the ones empowered to push back against this type of thinking, not advocating for the acceptance of this type of risk. The commercial benefit security provides should be the ability to continue to do business, unfortunately existing laws are incredibly weak in many ways and there is little to no accountability for executives who prioritize profit margin over protecting their customers’ data.",

          "text": "Interesting post, says a lot of truisms but I’m not sure some of this is practical, I’ve got two comments: \n\n**Firstly on “talking money” in incident reports**\n\n> say “you have a high insolvency risk from a major incident” and suddenly you’ve got board-level attention. I frame all my assessments this way, even for small businesses.\n\n> The trick, of course, is having the data and vocabulary to model the commercial implications.\n\nYes, of course, dollar figures can raise urgency; but you talk about “modelling” risk in financial terms. Anyone who’s been through this exercise knows it’s an exercise in choosing which variables to multiply together. Very Often, in practice, best case is $0 and worst case is the sky has fallen. \n\nDay to day does this boil down to maturing finding severity ratings + canned copy in the report? \n\nIn my experience this requires more restraint be exercised than vocabulary. Very easy to scaremonger and kick up urgency. Not so easy to scale (aka show true granular relative risk and help the business to prioritise over time). \n\nLong story short: Talking “insolvency” or business outcomes with execs who (should) know 100x more than you about the business is a minefield, don’t you think? \n\n**secondly: on providing rich, end to end remediation plans to the business** \n\nThe “time to low risk” metric as you call it. Another no brainer: yes execs would love this - but how do you do it at scale? \n\nAs you describe incidents are rarely simple and can have many compound causes. \n\nYou have, say, 30 findings. Just to make up an example, they’re across: Appsec issues flagged by sast (plus some old ancillary risk for good measure), container rehydration issues with several modules, EOL components in use, legacy internally developed library dependencies flagged by sca, architecture review shows some red flags, auth is not blueprint standard but risk is unclear, an api not discovered by inventory, and to top it off external risk rating agencies are starting to ding you. (Now, your post talks about IR, but your template talks about general risk posture assessment. If it’s the latter I’ve kept things very very simple in this example). \n\nYou ask all the questions, like it’s a lack of business consideration that causes security to not hand this information over: \n\n> How many months will it take? How much will it cost? Who will do the work? How do they measure success?\n\nBut how do you, as cyber, answer them systematically before even issuing a report? Is that even possible for nontrivial orgs you are not embedded in (I mean, I’m sure there’s some people much smarter than me who could infer a tonne and get pretty far - but I assume this template is for the average responder?) \n\nAre just just giving generic canned solutions/plans to symptoms of generic problems? In which case the “actionable plan” sales pitch is a bit overhyped. \n\nAt scale: Answering these questions - actually answering them - is more work than responding to the incident in the first place. Much more work. Often it is also work that security absolutely cannot do in isolation - so you find yourself needing buy in from business long before you can give them these answers with any confidence at all. \n\nObviously an end to end project plan would be easier to action but if it was as simple as just doing that, it would be the default already.\n\n> You want your client to feel like they’ve been handed a solution, not a problem.\n\nYes obviously but the reason IR doesn’t hand the business fully fledged solutions on a silver platter are, in short, doing so scales very slowly and comes with many built in challenges.",

When we're dealing with security assessments, we only have several finite tools with which to deal with assessments of any kind.\n\n\\- We can look at control effectiveness  \n\\- We can look at service maturity  \n\\- We can look at governance  \n\\- We can look at risk\n\nEach of these domains is highly specalised, and with mature buyers like enterprises, they will almost always be very separate engagements with different stakeholders.\n\nBut for smaller organisations, it's impractical. So instead you have to squish multiple concepts together - because ultimately, what we want to do is best advise the organisation and ensure their business has strong margins (not weighed down by unnecessary cybersecurity cost centres) and can remain functional even if a disaster happened with their technology. That's the quintessence of our job.\n\nI accept basically all your points, I guess my only response is that we still have to do SOMETHING, and this is probably one of the best things you can do with the budget, resourcing, and buyer requirements that we most often have,",

SSL VPNs have seen some of the most 0day vulnerabilities on record, and these issues simply have not affected IPSEC implementations. \n\nHowever - in all the cases I’m aware of, adding MFA to the SSL VPN has been a mitigating measure. The vulnerabilities have only affected standard accounts with no second factor. This makes sense of course because your second factor will always involve a non-SSL identity component that’s much harder to spoof or break. \n\nThis means that the cheapest and most effective thing a client can do is just add MFA. Removing the implementation completely is a huge project and highly disruptive to working practices that are already comfortable with the current process. \n\nIn principle, I agree that IPSEC is the more secure implementation out of the two. But it doesn’t mean it’s the best advice to give a client if they’re stuck with an alternative solution.",

We have lost the internet, let’s be honest,” De Bruycker said. “If I want my information 100 per cent in the EU . . . keep on dreaming,” he added. “You’re setting an objective that is not realistic.”\n\nThe Belgian official warned that Europe’s [cyber defences](https://archive.ph/o/Z27fR/https://www.ft.com/cyber-security) depended on the co-operation of private companies, most of which are American. “In cyber space, everything is commercial. Everything is privately owned,” he said.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nEurope needed to build its own capabilities to strengthen innovation and security, said De Bruycker, adding that legislation such as the EU’s AI Act, which regulates the development of the fast-developing technology, was “blocking” innovation.\n\nHe suggested that EU governments should support private initiatives to build scale in areas such as cloud computing or digital identification technologies.\n\nIt could be similar to when European countries jointly set up the planemaker Airbus, he said: “Everybody was supporting the Airbus initiatives decades ago. We need the same initiative on \\[an\\] EU level in the cyber domain.”",

And they act to maintain the US owned walled gardens by preventing adversarial interoperability. Any real digital sovereignty seems impossible until we end these anti-circumvention laws.\n\nAcross the world, anti-circumvention laws could usually just be repealed at the national level, although some EU rules push them too, and must be repealed.\n\nEurope's only companies who profit from anti-circumvention laws should be treated as organized crime rings : Volkswagen and other car companies, who kill thouands via the diesel gate; Medtronic, whose vender lock-ins killed people by bricking ventilators during covid, Newag, whose vender lock-in makes repairing trains expensive and difficult.\n\n\\> *The Belgian official warned that Europe’s cyber defences depended on the co-operation of private companies, most of which are American.*\n\nYou cannot really buy \"cyber defence\" from any foreign company, not closed source tool anyways.  Instead, you need to take cyber defence seriously yourselfs, which firstly means making data unobtainable, either through encryption or through destruction.  \n\nEurope had a sane-ish first step under GDPR, but now they have started doing the opposite via [Chat Control](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1nb2hnr/perceptual_hashing/) and [data retention](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1pkq6qy/eu_revives_plan_for_yearlong_data_retention/).   European nations even hires foreign companies for wiretapping like Palantir and Huawei, meanwhile the FBI now endorses end-to-end encryption like Signal because they discovered they'd never remove Chinese spies from [their CALEA mandated wiretapping infrastructure](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/calea-was-a-national-security-disaster-waiting-to-happen)\n\nIn fact, Europe's idiot leaders signed the [UN cybercrime convention](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Unlimited-Evidence-Gathering-EU-Ratifies-Controversial-UN-Cybercrime-Convention-10752328.html) which effectively promises to criminalize developing \"cyber defence\" (hint: It's written by Russia).",

Would you have preferred to do anything different?\n\n2) do you have a strategy for splitting your team's time on actual IR work, forensics, report writing and responding to clients who are demanding updates every few minutes?\n\n3) the stories I've heard from incident responders is that they get burnt out and develop mental health issues, after years of being on call and undergoing repeated intense periods of stress. How do you keep yourself and your team from burning out?\n\n4) when you first get thrown into the chaos of an attack investigation, what are your usual steps for getting a sense of what's happening?\n\n5) what are the unique observations during an investigation that made you go \"woah guys come and look at this finding!\"\n\n6) how do you deal with having to learn so much, in so little time across different investigations? Like, one day it would be DNS hijacking across the world, then a vendor's hardware that's compromised in a supply chain attack, then hundreds of devices infected with ransomeware, then a customer's kubernetes cluster is infected. It always amazes me how IR teams can do this.\n\n7) Do you have a strategy for your team on keeping track of previous investigations and revisiting that information during new incidents?\n\n8) I've personally experienced first hand, incident investigators being treated in a hostile and unhelpful manner from clients who engaged them. Do you have similar stories about these kinds of behaviours and tips on how to overcome this?\n\n9) any stories on investigations where you just went \"sigh, this really isn't worth my/my team's time\"?",

Most groups don't use sophisticated tactics, they are home-made but not sophisticated. Tradecraft is an art, and only a few groups took this seriously and had good operational procedures.",

As otherwise it couldn’t function. But that kind of thing tends to require serious consideration for RMM script execution, as they write the scripts onto disk ad-hoc (hopefully they handle signed scripts correctly).\n\nBut don't exclude RMM tools from on-access or behavioural scanning of your EDR, that'd be silly. Supply chain compromises can and do happen, and allow listing directories that the RMM resides within is a really good way to be compromised. If you allow-list the individual hashes of the program, that would be extra work every time there's an agent update, and also means RMM script execution likely would not be possible to exclude by hash or signature alone.\n\nAnd then from the attacker perspective, if I want somewhere to execute further code without anyone stopping me, I would enumerate all installed programs and look up their documented paths the vendor recommends be excluded from EDR. If whoever admins those systems has added those exclusions, surely one of those directories is a perfect place for a persistent backdoor.",

This would not be vendor-driven, just real-world habits and resources from folks doing the work.\n\nRather than reinventing the wheel or turning this into a promo, I would love to keep it simple.\n\nIf you are willing, drop a message at the [collection\\_point](http://www.cyops.com.au) covering:\n\n* Your fav way to stay current (on-the-job learning, specific podcasts, blogs, newsletters, books, conferences, etc.)\n* Why this method works well for you\n* Who you think it is most useful for\n* Anything you wish you had found earlier in your career\n\nIf there is enough interest, the goal would be to summarize the responses into a resource such as an article, web site or similar where we can guide others in our field and more importantly, back here for the community.\n\nAppreciate all the thoughtful input so far. This sub consistently delivers.\n\n**Note:** The “collection point” is simply a link to a website. I’m using that wording deliberately, rather than the website name, to avoid any self-promo or advertising. The goal is to give back to this sub and, hopefully, be useful to the wider community.",

The script then detects who controls the IP address, and if it's Microsoft, it emails a report to [abuse@microsoft.com](mailto:abuse@microsoft.com) when an IP hits 100 404 errors across all websites on the server. I have this script running every 15 minutes.\n\nI've never received any responses for the emails sent to [abuse@microsoft.com](mailto:abuse@microsoft.com).\n\nIn the past 24 hours, 56 Microsoft identified IPs were conducting probing attacks. The problem is that this never ends. The IPs constantly shift.\n\nPreviously, I was manually blocking by /24 blocks, but it was too much work to constantly be adding blocks to the firewall, so the script is supposed to handle this, but the attacks and high server load continue.\n\nI literally just temporarily blocked 4.0.0.0/8 and 20.0.0.0/8 just to kill off an attack. MS has many blocks in those two subnets.\n\nUsually, about five times a day, my server is unavailable or degraded due to these probing attacks. A couple days ago, that was ten times that the server was bogged down with these attacks.\n\nThis wasn't a problem a couple years ago, but now it's a major issue.\n\nConversely, when I report these to AWS or Google, they are dealt with quickly.\n\nI've tried to figure out a way to speak with someone at MS about this. I called the number listed with ICANN and managed to figure out how to search by name, and by trying common last names found actual extensions to call (as well as conference rooms). I have yet to actually connect with a human doing this, even when calling someone's direct extension.\n\nI've found others complaining on Microsoft's help forums, and the MS response completely got it wrong, thinking that the their Azure server was being attacked, not that Azure IPs were attacking an outside server. When corrected on this, the MS rep said that they needed an Azure account for help in that matter (completely sidestepping the issue).\n\nHow best to handle this situation?",

My aim is to automate this such that reporting is done automatically to any data center, not just MS. I'm targetting MS because presently that's where 90% of the probing attacks are coming from now.\n\nIf this works well enough, I might push it to github and encourage other server admins to install in hopes to shut the bad actors down as fast as possible.",

Like $500k/year is a “reasonable” price. I can definitely see it being impossible, but if you can afford it, it’s worth it. \n\nEven with cloudflare you’re going to see bad traffic. Cloudflare just gives you more tools to block what you need to without breaking real traffic.\n\nBefore cloudflare it was a constant flood of ddos attacks in the range of ~250k unique ips. Vultr, digital ocean, and azure were the worst. In order. Probing is constant from everywhere.\n\nA few things I’ve done that work without cloudflare, but do require some work to put together.\n\n- identify bad requests in your logs, and filter by unique IP addresses, and block all requests. I’ve used memcached with ingress-nginx (rip) access_by_lua to check for banned IPs. It was reasonable to about 100k rps per instance on 6-8y old hardware. \n\n- fail2ban. It doesn’t work with billions of ips, but it’s easy to set up. It’s possible someone has an ebpf method that performs better than iptables, but I haven’t looked in a while. \n\n- properly set up robots.txt\n\n- block requests that you know are bad. I.e specific user agents, invalid hostnames, etc.\n\n- set up reasonable rate limits\n\n- just leave client connections hanging. Instead of returning a 403/429, just don’t send a response. (Nginx 444, it works fantastically for botnets in my experience, and ties up at least some resources on the client for a while.)\n\n- appropriate syn flood thresholds on your edge firewalls.",

Hiring someone else is not carte blanche to not give a fuck. Ubisoft has enough technical resources to be expected to vet a contractors processes and policies for handling data, more than enough technical know-how to be held liable in the case of a breach. It might be different for small businesses or solo, non-technical workers who don't have the capacity or knowledge to assess a vendor's security practices. But Ubisoft is not such an organization.\n\nIn this case it's probably not relevant unless actual consumer data or payment methods are shown to be compromised due to the outsourcing, but your statement is just wrong.",

          "text": "\"A new sample of the ToneShell backdoor, typically seen in Chinese cyberespionage campaigns, has been delivered through a kernel-mode loader in attacks against government organizations.\n\nThe backdoor has been attributed to the Mustang Panda group, also known as HoneyMyte or Bronze President, that usually targets government agencies, NGOs, think tanks, and other high-profile organizations worldwide.\n\nSecurity researchers at Kaspersky analyzed a malicious file driver found on computer systems in Asia and discovered that it has been used in campaigns since at least February 2025 against government organizations in Myanmar, Thailand, and other Asian countries.\n\nEvidence showed that the compromised entities had prior infections with older ToneShell variants, PlugX malware, or the ToneDisk USB worm, also attributed to state-sponsored Chinese hackers.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, the new ToneShell backdoor was deployed by a mini-filter driver named ProjectConfiguration.sys and signed with a stolen or leaked certificate valid between 2012 and 2015 and issued to Guangzhou Kingteller Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nMini-filters are kernel-mode drivers that plug into the Windows file-system I/O stack and can inspect, modify, or block file operations. Security software, encryption tools, and backup utilities typically use them.\n\nProjectConfiguration.sys embeds two user-mode shellcodes in its .data section, each executed as a separate user-mode thread to be injected into user-mode processes.\n\nTo evade static analysis, the driver resolves required kernel APIs at runtime by enumerating loaded kernel modules and matching function hashes, rather than importing functions directly.\n\nIt registers as a mini-filter driver and intercepts file-system operations related to deletion and renaming. When such operations target the driver itself, they are blocked by forcing the request to fail.\n\nThe driver also protects its service-related registry keys by registering a registry callback and denying attempts to create or open them. To ensure priority over security products, it selects a mini-filter altitude above the antivirus-reserved range.\n\nAdditionally, the rootkit interferes with Microsoft Defender by modifying the configuration of the WdFilter driver so it is not loaded into the I/O stack.\n\nTo shield injected user-mode payloads, the driver maintains a list of protected process IDs, denies handle access to those processes while the payloads are executing, and removes protection once execution completes.\n\n\"This is the first time we’ve seen ToneShell delivered through a kernel-mode loader, giving it protection from user-mode monitoring and benefiting from the rootkit capabilities of the driver that hides its activity from security tools,\" says Kaspersky.\n\nThe new variant of the ToneShell backdoor that Kaspersky analyzed features changes and stealth enhancements. The malware now uses a new host identification scheme based on a 4-byte host ID market instead of the 16-byte GUID used previously, and also applies network traffic obfuscation with fake TLS headers.\n\nIn terms of the supported remote operations, the backdoor now supports the following commands:\n\n0x1 — Create a temporary file for incoming data\n\n0x2 / 0x3 — Download file\n\n0x4 — Cancel download\n\n0x7 — Establish a remote shell via a pipe\n\n0x8 — Receive operator command\n\n0x9 — Terminate shell\n\n0xA / 0xB — Upload file\n\n0xC — Cancel upload\n\n0xD — Close connection\n\nKaspersky advises that memory forensics is key in uncovering ToneShell infections backed by the new kernel-mode injector.\n\nThe researchers have high confidence in attributing the new ToneShell backdoor sample to the Mustang Panda cyberespionage group. They assess that the threat actor has evolved its tactics, techniques, and procedures to gain operational stealth and resilience.\n\nThe cybersecurity company provides in its report a short list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) to help organizations detect Mustang Panda intrusions and defend against them.\"",

It was inside for months undetected, pulling admin credentials, network maps, traffic flows… the stuff defenders dread. \n\nWhat’s weird to me is how often these 'state-sponsored' attacks aren’t about some sci-fi exploit no one’s ever seen. They’re about living off existing holes, stale configurations, and systems that are just way too hard to update or monitor well enough to notice someone walking around inside. \n\nThe headlines talk strategy and geopolitics, but the real problem feels like we still trust giant interconnected systems to stay invisible until the bad guys decide to leave. That rarely works out well.\n\nIs the cybersecurity community freaking out about 'nation state mastery' or are these breaches really just exposing how fragile our critical networks already are?",

Forget solutions that cost money, I have just enough budget to pay annual licensing fees and whatever annual increase I get is invariably eaten up by vendor price increases. \n\nAnd that's not even mentioning c-suite members that are concerned (for whatever base reason) with the learning curve of moving from network shares to cloud storage with DLP and App Protection Policies.  I've been fighting that battle since mid 2023 and feel I've made no positive progress.  \n\nWell, at least rumor is the biggest naysayer is retiring this Summer, so :fingers crossed: maybe, just maybe I'll be able to get it pushed through afterwards.",

That is pre-2013 thinking and really does not work anymore.  If someone wants to get into your system, they will.  It is not even about being interconnected, it is about the capabilities of newer systems to find vulnerabilities.  They might be software related or even process related.   Your helpdesk used Employee ID as a validator for users making password resets, but now the employee ID is part of the username and you did not remove that validator.  Those type of process issues crop up over time and are hard to find.    \n  \nWhat you need to do is build your security to say \"when they get in, how will I detect them\".  Things like ingesting all the logs you can, finding anomalies and reporting on them or using time based reviews to say \"This user does not normally work at this time\" is how you catch these things now.  And, in 10-15 years, that will change.  That is the process of cyber.  Threat actors find new ways in and SOCs find how to find them and eliminate the issue.",

I looked past that then during the conversation, he asked me what is my long term plan , I said I love cybersecurity and would love to become an expert, he goes like ‘then this role is not for you’…\n\nWth? , I was mad but I explained that in order to reach my goal I definitely need to start somewhere..\n\nLong story short , after waiting for a month with repeated calls and emails to ask of feedback ( I got no answers by the way ), they just got back to me that the role has been given to someone else and that I was the second best so they will contact me when a new position opens up by the end of Q1 this year.\n\nTo be fair life has been really tough and I’m giving up on my IT and cybersecurity dreams … I just got my SIA badge , I’ll rather take my chances on there done deal with these cooperate stuff.",

They can provide a foot in the door somewhere.  \n\n2.  TL/DR Break the ice and make it a conversation about the job vs an interview for the job.  The bad vibes thing is never fun.  Sometimes it's just the person has had a crappy day, other times it's them just going through the motions to satisfy some quota of \"I interviewed 3 people\".  That said, I'm not sure if you were in a sterile meeting area or in his office, but one of the first things I do is look around the office to see what stuff the person has on the walls, on a bookcase, desk, etc., and if I can I'll make a call out about it to try and make a connection.  For example, if I see a baseball on someone's desk I'll say something like, \"Who's your team?\" and motion/nod towards the baseball.  (make sure you know something about baseball, however, and don't talk family stuff..way to many landmines there)  \n  \n3.  Know something about the company and the job before you walk in the door.  If working with a Head Hunter ask about who you'll be interviewing with (your success puts money in their pocket).  If via their HR dept, know some of what they do, who they are, even check out linked in (It has to be good for something, after all).  \n  \n4.  One thing I've responded a few times to the \"where do you want to be in X # of years?\" (and you have to read the room for this) is \"I want your job, and I know that to get that I'll have to promote you out of yours\".  A less bold statement and safer statement might be \"I want to learn the business and move into a senior engineer or leadership role.\"  The point being you need to make the person doing the hiring and firing that you're looking to be on his team and have his back.  \n  \nBest of luck and keep trying!",

Plenty of people start in IT support and move into security later, that’s normal.\n\nFive months of unemployment messes with your head, so don’t beat yourself up for feeling done. Taking a security job to pay bills isn’t “giving up”, it’s just survival.\n\nIf you do decide to keep one foot in IT/cyber, focus less on interviews and more on building confidence again. Hands-on stuff helps a lot with that. Blue-team labs where you actually investigate alerts and incidents are closer to real work than just studying. Platforms like CyberDefenders are good for that because they’re built around SOC workflows, not theory.\n\nEven if you step away for a bit, your interest in cyber doesn’t disappear.

I start a new gig later this month, here's what I had to do. \n\nLinkedin full of all the right words, nobody is going to actually read it, but it has to scan well enough for both bot or person to see what they want. \n\nI searched every single technology recruitment firm (not corporate recruitment as part of their HR) and messaged each and every one of them with my resume. Some only communicate on linkedin via messaging, some have their own web page with a form you fill and some just have email. Write an introductory blurb you can recycle and use it for your email or forms. I could hit about 30 in about two hours if I were focused. I filtered based on US location (but you may do it differently) and more than 10k followers. You'll hit some duds and dead ends, but it is a numbers game. Remember 3rd party recruiters only get paid when they fill a spot. You don't have to be the best person for the role, you just have to be easy to sell and most importantly AVAILABLE immediately. They are incentivized to pump you up for the interview. This approach got me the most traction. I had quite a few interviews with this approach, I got my last job using this method. Sadly, I couldn't close any positions I interviewed for, probably close to a dozen calls. \n\nOf all the irony, I got my current role by doing the thing I've NEVER in my life done. I applied on the company website, interviewed and got the role. Seriously, this approach has gotten me the fewest number of interviews and has never, until now, resulted in a job. \n\nI did not waste my time redoing my resume for each and every job. If you're applying to similar roles, there should be no reason to do this. I bought a subscription to Teal, I didn't find it very useful. It was slow and clunky, there was no button that would just tune your resume. It would just show you what was wrong and tell you to fix it. Would not recommend. I bought another that literally robo-filled applications for you on a select number of websites. It worked REALLY well, so if you're going for straight numbers, you might want to do it. You populated your data, gave it search criteria and just let it run. It seriously just auto-fills EVERYTHING for you, never got hung up or stuck and just ran as long as you let it run. You have to buy credits to fuel it, but they were cheap. I think it was called LiftMyCV.",

GRC/compliance roles are pretty specialized and a lot of businesses are not looking to expand roles that aren't directly product focused or direct revenue impacting. Compliance and grc can greatly impact finances if something goes wrong, but it's often a backburnered position. \n\nThe battle you're facing is one of being unique in your field. This is going to require things like making your resume a bit more modern. Try looking at different resume templates on places like canva for ideas on that front. You'll also need individualized cover letters for each position you apply for. Since 90% of the resumes your sending out are filtered through ai before they even get to a person, cover letters add extra bs to the like that may satisfy the rubric they're grading applicants on. \n\nLastly, networking is going to be your friend. You're going to need to use LinkedIn or go to some in person conferences and \"expand your professional network\" to get your resume and skills in front of more people. My success rate on blind applications is far lower than jobs referred by someone in my network. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Hey r/cybersecurity,\n\nA few months ago, I shared a beta project on Reddit to index OSINT tools. The goal was to stop bookmarking dead GitHub repos and create a searchable, filterable database.\n\nSince then, the list has grown from \\~100 to **930+ tools**.\n\n**What changed:**\n\n* **Search & Filtering:** You can now filter specifically by category (e.g., \"Social Media\", \"Dark Web\", \"People Search\") to cut through the noise.\n* **Community Submission:** The biggest request was the ability to add tools. I’ve added a submission engine so if you maintain a repo or find a new tool, you can add it to the index yourself.\n* **Availability Status:** We are tracking which tools are free vs. paid (and those that are \"freemium\" traps).\n\n**The Directory:** You can browse the full list here: [**https://think-pol.com/tools**](https://think-pol.com/tools)\n\n**No login required.** No paywall. Just a clean index.\n\nI’m currently doing a manual review to tag the \"Risk Level\" of the new batch (flagging tools that are aggressive scrapers vs. passive lookups). If you see a tool that is miscategorized or broken, please use the report/submit button so I can fix it.\n\nHope this helps in your work.",

May I suggest a toggle in the top right corner that persists between the different web pages?\n\nThis may be only on my end but at 1080p in mozilla the Social media   intel button is cut off and only showing \"Social me\"  \n\nOnly other thought I had was:  Is there any way to flag non USA centric tools?(E.g.  most of the people search tools are USA only, but some aren't and include Canada.  In some cases like Canada 411/UK specifically mentioned in the description that's pretty obvious, but not the case for most of them).

Add columns for \"alternative question 1\", \"alternative question 2\" to make keyword searching more effective. (free [Notion template here](https://www.notion.so/2cf8369439288046911cff236e8eecb7?v=2cf836943928809ba494000c5462467b&source=copy_link))\n* Use ChatGPT / LLM with care. Using your exported knowledge base from above + an LLM can be effective but you need to check each answer to make sure it ties back to KB entry or is empty if there is nothing relavent.\n* Use a dedicated tool. There are a few out there: Vanta and Drata have them as a bundled add on. Conveyor is great for larger orgs with dedicated compliance teams. I'm building ResponseHub specifically for smaller teams (self-serve, PAYG pricing, built in explainers).",

This is one of those problems that looks operational on the surface but is actually structural.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, the real-time sink isn’t the volume of questions; it’s the lack of a *single source of truth*. Most teams have policies, audits, past questionnaires, and risk decisions scattered across tools, so every new questionnaire becomes a manual reconciliation exercise. That’s where inconsistencies creep in.\n\nA few patterns I keep noticing:\n\n* Teams start with spreadsheets because they’re flexible, then they collapse under version control and ownership issues.\n* GRC tools help with compliance tracking, but they’re often rigid when it comes to narrative, context-heavy questionnaires.\n* Notion works for early-stage teams, but it doesn’t scale well once audits, vendors, and regulators get involved.\n\nThe teams that suffer less are the ones that standardize *how* answers are governed, assign clear ownership, map controls, and agree on a shared language before worrying about tooling. Automation helps, but only after that foundation exists.\n\nYour AI approach makes sense to me, especially for search and consistency. The bigger question is how teams ensure answers stay aligned with actual controls and risk posture over time, not just fast responses.\n\nCurious to see how others here are balancing speed vs accuracy as well.",

The commonality among governance, risk, and compliance is they are all strategic in nature, meaning they are mostly in the hands of the senior level of an organization (e.g., board or ownership). While there are components that are operational, that's mostly the box checking, the data collection. Translating that data into an actionable strategy, however, takes a lot of experience and general business acumen.  Whether addressing GRC in a third-party role (auditing or consulting) or internally, it can be very challenging because you end up sandwiched between a senior level that might not respect your strategic insight and operational employees who don't think you have the technical chops. This is why, in my experience, the people who are effective in the job tend to have pretty deep resumes.",

          "text": "Would you trust an E1 to lead you into battle?\n\nA long time ago, people on LinkedIn tried to argue that you didn't need technical experience or a home lab to make it in cybersecurity. And now, I am going to grab an excerpt from an article I wrote in response to this:\n\nYou need to see what it really takes to get your compliance initiative off the ground, so that you can be sure that your team of engineers can actually pull off what you're going to put on them.\n\nWhat will you have to say when a customer asks you a tough question that requires actual hands-on knowledge? Ask the engineers you tasked with an assignment without actually knowing whether or not the job was done correctly? I couldn’t fathom being responsible for building or managing (and attesting to the deliverables from) a team of cybersecurity professionals if I didn’t have some form of hands-on experience in what I was managing. Most people work their way up to management from said trenches; whereas they have developed, through trials and tribulation, the skills necessary to guarantee a good job is done.\n\nHaving hands-on experience sifting through logs or applying procedure to policy hints at a much deeper degree of understanding and capability. This is what companies are really looking for today. Not a master of theory. Not a pencil pusher. A practitioner. A doer. They want someone they can trust.\n\nWhen you are getting a job in cyber, you are being trusted to handle the most sensitive aspects of a business. If all you have is some theory and limited experience with online lab exercises, but you’ve “never actually touched a router” or applied a ZTA framework to a network design (or even used a console cable) then how can you expect a business to take you seriously and entrust the physical routers and their actual IT infrastructure to you when you are supposed to “know this stuff” inside and out? Are they supposed to just trust that you can provide legitimate attestation of compliance that would stand up to scrutiny or hold up in a court of law? Audits must be verified, because there are times when automated scans will come back missing key information about infrastructure or services, or cannot be performed on sensitive architecture.\n\nYes, we have jobs that don’t require you to physically touch things, but these all require skills that in of themselves will expose you to what you would have seen in your own lab anyways. Being prepared; knowing what you are looking at; is worth gold. With hands-on experience, you won't just know what it really takes to get a stack up to snuff, you'll know how to prove it was done correctly. You won't be able to do that otherwise.\n\nEnd excerpt. With all that being said, GRC is not a beginner-friendly job because, as I mentioned in the trials and tribulations bit, you need to know what it really looks like to take a system, harden it, apply policy that aligns with an organizational goal, and provide legitimate attestation of compliance. It is more suited for people that value a desk job more than the thrill of the chase, and people tend to loathe auditors. Orin Thomas  of Microsoft famously refers to them during his seminars as \"The Guys With Ties,\" and frames them as  villains.",

I started 8 years ago with a group of contractors and only had a CS degree with no prior job experience that was relevant. Now you’re competing against people with masters degrees at minimum along with 5+ years experience. I would say the threshold to meet to get a job in GRC is low relative to other more technical roles. It’s competing with other people for positions that makes it hard.

You will have almost zero opportunity to fix something that isn't a process or procedure.

My main friend in TPRM sends me messages almost every day about how he didn't wake up until noon and no one came looking for him.

Feel free to correct me or add something in the comments!\n\nDisclaimer 2: This post is hand-crafted! Don’t make my immaculate formatting skills fool you into thinking it’s AI!\n\nSome time ago, my [post about children as young as seven ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1pi3ipq/children_as_young_as_seven_are_being_referred_to/)being referred to Britain's national cybercrime intervention programme blew up. The discussion in the comments (particularly around parental responsibility) inspired me to compile this list of beginner-friendly cybersecurity resources you can share with your kids or anyone who wants to start their career in the industry.  \n  \n========\n\n**Hands-On Learning Platforms:**\n\n[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) \\- Needs no introduction.

AI *is*  helping in a lot of ways. \n\nBut the more I dig into it the more it feels like ai is also creating just as many problems as it’s solving.\n\nSome reports say 13% of companies have already experienced AI related security incidents and 97% of them admitted they dont even have proper ai access controls in place.

Most of the agent tools like Copilot and Claude offer sandboxing and allowing/disallowing certain tools, for example file modification and such, and enabling requiring-approvals, but that's all disabled by default and has to be configured by the user. \n\nThere exists a need to apply preventative controls to all users, and I'm not sure what the answer is.",

LLM is prone to hallucinations and Symbolic is logic based and needs constant rules updating. \n\nBoth so far are generalist and don't understand nuance or your operating environment. \n\nAn action done by customer service could be a compromised account but if it was done by engineering or done in a test environment would be completely legitimate. \n\nI like symbolic because I can understand what logic is being applied and can quickly rule in or rule out an alert. The black box nature of LLM leaves me questioning why an alert went off. Like why does it compute that this is malicious. \n\nI think that AI could have a possibility of helping if it is augmented with all the relevant information such as employee dept and title and if it was baselined with about 5 years of normal activity within your environment. \n\nSo far I have seen a lot of sloppy AI work. I believe that it still needs humans to check what it's doing. \n\nIf anything it's helped the offense more than the defense. Fixing the grammar and spelling for phishing emails but there's still things that I spot in phishing that AI hasn't fixed yet. Most common is using \"kindly\" and \"regards\" just aren't common in normal emails but are in 50% of the Phish that I see. Probably jinxing myself by mentioning it.",

Better writing, more persuasive emails, etc. Video and voice emulation is probably going to start changing the way we trust videoconferencing, but it'll mostly be at the whaling level since it requires real-time attention by the attacker.\n\nOn the employment side of things, expect to see companies trying to get by with fewer low-end analyst jobs. My advice there is essentially unchanged, however, which is that trying to get an \"entry level cybersecurity job\" is generally a bad idea. Get a helpdesk position, develop a thorough understanding of how computers and networking works when it's not under attack, then pivot into cybersecurity once you have a few years under your belt.\n\nFrom a product perspective, expect every company to claim AI is now powering their software. That will mean wildly differing things and should mostly be ignored. Consider whether the resultant product functions well or not, same as ever.\n\nIn terms of \"how will companies allow their employees to interact with LLMs?\", expect places to settle on single solutions that they pay to not incorporate queries into training data.

When we say AI powered it is implementing inline ML engines for detection, analysis and prevention in addition to packet filtering and DPI.  \n\nBut based on my ML experience, a large dependency is on the model chosen, and the prediction accuracy. Did not dive into the details, but it does not guarantee 100% accuracy.\n\n Also the two key factors of a firewall is efficacy and performance, so if there is an inline ML engine in the datapath, it should be high performance. \n\nBut yes, AI has hallucinations, and raises both false positives and negatives. This is new and exciting, but integrating in NGFW requires careful handling, which the majority of the vendors have taken care of I believe.\n\nAlso AI agents to implement FW configs is what most vendors have done, and is a cool feature.",

      "text": "I work on the internal security team at a regulated payments company. We process card transactions for other businesses, so outages immediately hit revenue and compliance nerves at the same time. The incident response bridge was opened when a supplier that handles part of our transaction routing began timing out during peak volume.\n\nAt the beginning it was framed as an availability issue, with transactions backing up and pressure building to provide a clear restoration timeline to the business. I joined because the integration touches regulated data, but the expectation was still that security would stay in the background unless something obviously malicious surfaced.\n\nAbout half an hour in, while people were debating rollback options, I started looking at the logs we were sharing. The retry traffic looked wrong. Requests were hitting endpoints that are not part of the documented production path. The supplier kept repeating that nothing had changed and that they were failing over internally to keep service alive.\n\nWhat they did not mention until later was that the failover path routes through an older service we thought was decommissioned. It still worked, which is why no alarms fired, but it bypasses one of our monitoring layers and handles data differently. We never designed it to run under load, let alone during an incident.\n\nAt that point I said out loud that this stopped being a clean outage. The response was immediate pushback. Procurement jumped in to say the supplier had already been reviewed and approved. Someone referenced the third-party record and said Panorays showed no active issues, like that settled the question. The score had not changed, so in their minds the risk had not either.\n\nI am watching live traffic move through a path we do not actively control while the incident is still in progress and recovery speed has become the dominant concern. Everyone else wants to keep the scope narrow so the bridge can be closed and the issue treated as resolved. I am stuck trying to explain why a system behaving exactly as it was never meant to behave cannot just be dismissed as operational noise.\n\nHow do I push to reclassify this without being remembered as the person who delayed recovery and forced old approval decisions back into active dispute?",

          "text": "\"an older service we thought was decommissioned. It still worked\"...that right there would be considered a security incident, that's a huge change control failure.  You mentioned \"regulated data\", so if this data is now passing through a service that cannot legally support those regulatory requirements...really, this is out of your hands.  This is how I would frame it; this would be considered a data leak, or in more strict NIST 800-53 language an active \"information leakage\" event. Right now you should be preparing to contact whatever regulatory authorities are over this data, at a minimum you should file a report via CISA so you have a solid third-party evidence artifact.  At my workplace, I would be calling DC3 as it would be some CUI data flow going through a service that was never assessed or given ATO to handle that data.\n\nThe bad part: you will be remembered as the guy who delayed recovery, maybe.  Honestly, that is just part of the job of cyber security. We always make everything more complicated. My email signature is literally \"security is directly proportional to inconvenience\".  I am always that guy saying \"wait, not so fast, what about XYZ regulation?\" or \"that cloud vendor isn't FedRAMP so we can't send them that type of data\"...I've even argued with senior VIPS and pulled the whole \"if the company does X, that will border on potential wilful negligence that has actual criminal potential under DFARS\" and have had to stick to my guns. That VIP no longer works for my company, not because of that (probably? I didn't report them or anything but...) but this is the hard part of the job.  Or the fun part, depending on your personality LOL.\n\nBut you don't HAVE to delay anything; just keep record of the data leak; contact the appropriate regulatory authorities NOW, but let everyone else get it resolved. Let them know there WILL be an after-action report follow-up on this, and that the failures WILL be addressed and systems WILL be decommissioned. Use the power that comes from the regulations to push the needed fix; that's why they exist.  Remember, ALL REGULATIONS ARE WRITTEN IN BLOOD.  Something bad happened in the past, this regulation is part of the fix. Preserve your evidence. \n\nI would also say that something is amiss with the Panorays stuff.  I'm not familiar with it, but a system that was SUPPOSED to be decommissioned but wasn't and is now flowing regulated data should 100% be increasing whatever risk assessment system it uses.  If it's not, that means that probably it has ZERO visibility of the actual data flow path endpoints.",

Understanding what your TL and manager need you to complete for projects to be successful. If that requires more expertise in a specific security domain, then learn more there. Since you have a SWE background I’m guessing your role will be focused on building things, where you’ll be more successful in learning how to be an engineer in that company’s ecosystem. Not necessarily in learning more about “security” in general or worrying about certs. \n\nYou can have a conversation with your manager and ask things like “how do I make sure I’m successful here? What do you need to see from me, what can I do to grow into the role?”\n\nReddit can offer general advice but your manager knows exactly what they need from you. \n\nCongrats on the role, happy to answer more questions.",

In the workplace, your knowledge of X might get you into conversations where you know nothing about Y and Z. For example, you might be hired for your competence at secure application development, but then you'll find yourself pulled into a conversation about managing privileged access in Windows environments.\n\n\nYou kind of have to roll with it. I find that assuming good intentions from co-workers and leaders helps. \n\n\nIn a wider context, security is risk-based decision making, so try to approach security problems by identifying risks, vulnerabilities, threats, potential impacts, and then controls to help mitigate or avoid those risks. Breaking problems down by this will help you rely less on a product-oriented or reactive approach to risks where you first look for product features to turn on to solve the problem.\n\n\nAnd personally, focusing on security fundamentals has helped me develop general confidence. Widely-accepted certs like Sec+ and CySA+ have helped me learn and study these. (Pick the certs yourself, though; I don't love what I've heard about CompTIA lately.)",

These agents screenshot challenges, send to GPT-4V/Claude, and get exact click coordinates back. reCAPTCHA and Turnstile weren't built for this.\n\nThis statement suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of reCAPTCHA and Turnstile.\n\nBoth reCAPTCHA and Turnstile can be configured to operate invisibly, both have made the decision whether or not to issue a token before the user ever interacts with it, and in case the site operator decides to make them display a widget or an interactive challenge, it is mostly for cosmetic/UX reasons and doesn’t meaningfully change the results. \n\nModern CAPTCHAs primarily use signals from your browser, your IP reputation history, your browsing activity (including on other websites) as seen by their network, and for Google, whether you’re logged into a Google account and the internal reputation score of that account. \n\nThat is also why any self-hosted CAPTCHA will never be as good, because you simply don’t have access to the same kind of signals across millions of different websites that Cloudflare and Google do.\n\nIf you don’t believe me, just try it for yourself on a known tainted IP address/blocked browser signals: simply Tor browser and try to pass a reCAPTCHA. Good luck.\n\nOr alternatively, look at it from an economic POV: the prices of bulk reCAPTCHA or Turnstile solves hasn’t meaningfully gone down with the introduction of vision AI or LLMs.",

There is no way to really block it entirely because it’s still a real person solving the captcha, all you can do is make it expensive enough that the attacker moves onto another target.\n\nResidential IPs can’t be recycled infinitely, it is a finite resource. Residential IP reputation like any other IP can be tainted too, if a particular residential IP is seen solving an abnormally large amount of captchas eventually you’ll get blocked.\n\nAttackers don’t have an infinite amount of aged Google accounts.

AI isn't Cortana from Halo.  But AI does have the potential to eliminate a lot of the (please no I'm not insulting anyone) low value skills to a business like scripting.\n\nWe no longer live in a world where some entry level guy gets hired and then is going to get 2 weeks of paid company time to learn how to make a script to do something simple.\n\nWithin the next 10 years or so I imagine that a lot of \"business\" employees are going to start taking on a lot of the Cyber responsibilities like auditing, system administration, etc. especially with the continuing migration to cloud and the continuing ease of use cloud provides. \n\nI would never tell my children to get into cyber. I would tell them to get a computer engineering degree, pick up a few certifications. This way they would be able to work as an engineer or do IT/IS.\n\nBut overall in my opinion I think we're seeing the last 10 years of this field. \n\nI'm not old but I've witnessed this field transition from cybersecurity actually being a huge concern to transitioning to being a theoretical concern that's only done because of government requirements. \n\nThe moment government stop requiring companies to do cybersecurity this field is going to die.",
