      "text": "The Swiss government has ended its contract with Palantir after federal agencies reportedly rejected the company at least nine times over seven years.\n\nThe reason is security concerns that should probably make other countries pause:\n\n* Risk of US intelligence gaining access to sensitive data\n* Potential loss of national sovereignty\n* Dependence on foreign specialists in crisis situations\n\nSwiss authorities essentially decided they don’t want Palantir software anywhere near core government work.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK has signed contracts worth over £800 million with Palantir Technologies for systems within the National Health Service and the Ministry of Defence. British MPs are now asking why their due diligence came to such a different conclusion.\n\nSwitzerland chose not to take the risk.\n\nIf a country known for caution and data security decided these risks were unacceptable, what are others seeing differently?What do you think?\n\n[Source](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/war-peace/why-palantir-is-becoming-a-risky-bet-for-switzerland/90666335).",

      "text": "Hey all, stumbled across something odd while digging into the Epstein DOJ releases.\n\nThe file EFTA01133110.pdf (from Data Set 9, the one with the raw meat slabs photo in a freezer that got pulled pretty quick) has this SHA-256 hash:\n\nbbbe03b56d9e47fdc5ffeb73a5c50a70e694af12f14566075fa283fb61fc7ee4\n\nI ran it on VirusTotal (public page: [ https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bbbe03b56d9e47fdc5ffeb73a5c50a70e694af12f14566075fa283fb61fc7ee4/behavior ](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bbbe03b56d9e47fdc5ffeb73a5c50a70e694af12f14566075fa283fb61fc7ee4/behavior))\n\n•  Static detections: 0/XX – totally clean on AV side.\n\n•  But the Behavior tab (sandboxes like CAPE, Jujubox, Zenbox) shows a bunch of red flags:\n\n•  Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203) + Process Injection (T1055)\n\n•  Anti-analysis stuff: IsDebuggerPresent, Sleep calls, GetTickCount/GetTickCount64 timing checks\n\n•  Drops temp files/logs/JS-related items, weird registry mods (mostly Adobe/Office paths), spawns Acrobat crash processors + system stuff like svchost/dllhost\n\n•  Network to adobe.com/Akamai/MSN domains (legit-looking but in context…)\n\n•  Mutexes like “Global\\\\\\\\AdobeCrashProcessor ocall\\\\\\_owl\\\\\\_ork” and “Global\\\\\\\\ARM Update Mutex”\n\nHighlighted text in sandbox: “EFTA01133110.pdf - Adobe Acrobat Reader (32-bit)”, dimensions like “1.488 x 20.28 in” at 319% zoom – clearly it’s rendering that meat photo.\n\nFrom what I read, the photo is just big steaks on a tray in a kitchen/freezer setup (people say it’s beef, maybe from Epstein’s properties?), but the PDF itself behaves like it has some exploit code or malformed junk that trips sandboxes.\n\nAnyone else upload/analyze this one? Is it just Adobe Reader being weird in VMs (font handling, crash reporting, etc.), or could the file have been tampered with before upload? Or maybe a false positive from how evidence photos get scanned/embedded?\n\nNot claiming it’s malware – just weird that a “simple photo PDF” from official DOJ drops looks like this dynamically. Thoughts?\n\n[Source file](https://filebin.net/5yo5jl18d97uo7uv)",

Then hold a conversation with the moderators until they felt comfortable letting you in. The user registration had to be manually approved by the moderators.\n\nSo many spam bots were stopped at the registration page because they would immediately spam when the only people who could see their post was themselves and the moderators; no one else. Regular users couldn't see who was allowed or blocked, and the blocked users' subsequent posts in the registration page were ignored by mods sorta like Reddit's shadow ban mechanism.\n\nWe banned a couple toxic people who lost their patience at our lengthy review timeline (because we were all volunteers doing this on our free time) and insulted us, ensuring that they never met the rest of the website users. I recall one seemly passed the sniff test, only to be banned by the admin because the admin recognized that person (I think it was their email address?) had been trolling on other websites and he was friends with those website owners.\n\nIf that website was still running today, almost none of its content would be in the LLMs' databases as all of the AI agents would have ran straight into the registration wall, unless a registered user scraped it themselves.\n\nIt would be a serious whiplash to see websites return to that gated entry method to avoid the flood of automated web scraping.",

Meaning, they won't take the time to learn how drawing, creative writing, or coding works - but they'll happily ask an AI to produce something and then take credit for it. \"It just takes a little googling\" is clearly something they don't have the patience for.\n\nThis means, they'll never actually use curl and APIs for automation and will very easily be convinced that the current type of AIs are safe, even when it's blatantly obvious for a technical person to see they're not.\n\nThe worst part (to me) is: at the time of writing, these types of people are often seen as \"early adopters\" or \"tech pioneers\", so businesses who are afraid of being left behind in the AI space race will happily pay these prompt kiddies to produce slop and start up more LLM-agents.

With AI agent skills/plugins, the attack surface is massively expanded because the skill can contain natural language instructions that redirect agent behavior at runtime. It's not just code execution, it's prompt injection as a delivery mechanism.\n\n\n\nThe [SKILL.md](http://SKILL.md) vector described here is particularly nasty. The malicious instruction isn't in executable code that static analysis tools can flag, it's in documentation that the AI agent reads and acts on. Traditional security scanning is essentially blind to this class of attack.\n\n\n\nWhat ClawHub needed from day one: behavioral sandboxing where new skills run in isolation with network egress monitoring before general availability, provenance requirements (verified publisher accounts, not 1-week-old GitHub accounts), and automated testing that actually exercises skill instructions rather than just checking for obvious malware signatures.\n\n\n\nThe ranking manipulation to get malicious content to #1 is the part that should be a wake-up call for every AI agent platform. Popularity metrics are trust signals, and they're trivially gameable. Any platform treating download counts as a quality signal without independent verification is building a ready-made distribution channel for this exact attack.\n\n\n\nExpecting this to become much more common across every agent marketplace in the next 12 months.",

Since I'm from Germany and you are as well, I'll give you my perspective from a german point of view with absolutely *zero* knowledge about Maltese jurisdiction.\n\nGetting the CSIRT involved immediately was correct and everyone who insists otherwise is... not particularly connected to reality.\n\nYou really, *really*, **really** should not have written that script. You also shouldn't have ran the script. If you had to run the script, you really should have used a VPN. You also really shouldn't have told them about the script.  \nThat wasn't smart, sorry. You should have either created a few accounts and tested on them, or gotten explicit written consent from some of your students to test with their accounts. In the end, you accessed private information about non-consenting individuals.\n\n30 days disclosure time is fine for such a simple vulnerability.\n\nTheir response was as (unfortunately) expected.\n\nSince I have no clue about maltese law, I can't comment on anything there.\n\nFrom a german perspective: Next time you find something disclose it anonymously via the [CCC](https://www.ccc.de/disclosure), [Heise](https://www.heise.de/investigativ/) or [BSI](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/IT-Sicherheitsvorfall/Unternehmen/Ich-moechte-einen-IT-Sicherheitsvorfall-melden/ich-moechte-einen-it-sicherheitsvorfall-melden_node.html). I'd probably go with CCC personally.\n\nI can also recommend to watch [this talk](https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-sicherheitslcke-gefunden-und-nun).\n\nAttention, hot take: You could also just anonymously publicly disclose it. Sucks for the company and the users, but there are good reasons for it, especially here in Germany.\n\nIn the end, the issue got fixed and you didn't get sued, so good job on making the internet a tad safer place.\n\nAlso, the comments under this reddit post kind of shock me.\n\nUnrelated: I like the style of your blog.

EU folks saying the CSIRT step was exactly right, North American folks acting like it was wildly hostile — nobody's wrong, they're just operating from different legal environments where the \"correct\" path actually differs.\n\nThe part I'd gently push back on is the script though. One account was already proof. Running a loop to enumerate everyone else doesn't change the severity of the vuln — it just adds surface area for the argument that you conducted deliberate bulk access to PII. \"I wanted to quantify scope\" is a much harder intent to defend than \"I stumbled across this on my own account and stopped there.\"\n\nI work on AI tooling and this comes up in a different form more than you'd think — you find something you have no business accessing, and the instinct is to poke at it to understand the full extent. But the moment you script it and iterate through records, you've crossed from accidental discovery into deliberate access. That line matters legally.\n\nVuln's fixed, data's no longer actively exposed, company got away with threatening the person who helped them. The legal letter is almost certainly just intimidation. But the lesson for next time: prove it on your own account or a dummy account, stop, disclose — ideally through the regulator first if that's your jurisdiction's expected path.",

          "text": "\"Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter aircraft can be jailbroken \"just like an iPhone,\" the Netherlands' defense secretary has claimed. Gijs Tuinman made the comments during a podcast interview after being asked whether the aircraft's software could be modified by European forces without permission from the US should it withdraw as an ally.\n\n\"The F-35 is truly a shared product,\" Tuinman told BNR's Boekestijn en De Wijk show (translated from Dutch). \"The British make the Rolls-Royce engines, and the Americans simply need them too. And even if this mutual dependency doesn't result in software updates, the F-35, in its current state, is still a better aircraft than other types of fighters.\"\n\n\"If you still want to upgrade despite everything, I'm going to say something I should never say, but I will anyway: you can jailbreak an F-35 just like an iPhone.\"\n\nTuinman did not elaborate on what he meant by this, but his comments suggest that European forces currently managing a fleet of F-35s would be capable of maintaining their aircraft's software, with or without the help of US manufacturer Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe Register contacted the aerospace engineering company for its take on Tuinman's words, but it referred us to the US government, which did not immediately reply.\n\nOne person who has experience in tinkering with aircraft tech is Ken Munro, whose company Pen Test Partners has poked under the hood of commercial planes many times.\n\nHe told us that while he was not familiar with the F-35 specifically, Tuinman's comments and what the Dutch defense secretary implied did not surprise him. However, without physical access to a fighter jet, the chance of a jailbreak becoming public knowledge is highly unlikely.\n\n\"Unlike consumer devices, such as the iPhone, which is easily accessed by the research community, and therefore subject to their 'attention,' one can't go buy an F-35 on eBay,\" he said.\n\n\"The barrier to entry for researchers and hackers is simply too high for military hardware. Hence, we rely on defense contractors getting security right the first time. That lack of a community doing its own research means that accidental and unintentional security issues aren't likely to be as easily found. Indeed, innovative attacks aren't likely to be carried out, as researchers can't access the required hardware.\"\n\n\"There is also a commercial motivation to discovering jailbreaks on consumer devices such as the iPhone.\"\n\nAnother reason why jailbreaking an F-35 won't be nearly as easy as commercial gadgets is the way in which its software is managed.\n\nAccording to a video published by Lockheed Martin in 2017, the F-35 Lightning II is updated through the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS).\n\nALIS has several applications devoted to various fleet management tasks, as well as for accessing an aircraft's technical data. Updates are delivered through service packs, much like any other major software update, every year or two.\n\nIsrael is the only country to have negotiated a deal with Lockheed Martin, allowing it to run its own software on its F-35I fleet.\n\nTuinman's comments come nearly a year after Joachim Schranzhofer, head of comms at German defense contractor Hensoldt, stoked fears that the US could remotely disable all European fleets.\n\nSpeaking to Bild, within the context of the US pausing military aid to Ukraine – to which it supplied F-16 aircraft – Schranzhofer said the idea of a remote \"kill switch\" was \"more than just a rumor.\"\n\nAt the time, wider fears of the US's power over F-35 aircraft and their updates spread across Europe.\n\nPortugal had already announced that its procurement plans for F-35s had been dropped following US political concerns, while Tussell data showed the UK's defense budget was being directed ever closer to Europe and away from the US.\"",

      "text": "I had an unexpected cybersecurity interview today and I’m honestly feeling very frustrated about how it went and the feedback I received.\n\ni have trimmed my answer to fit here, but i use much more example and words to explain everything \n\nThis wasn’t a scheduled interview. I went to meet a relative’s friend who works in a placement cell just to ask about opportunities, and suddenly he called someone to take my interview on the spot. I had not revised networking or fundamentals for about 6 months because recently I’ve been focused mainly on attack workflows and hands-on labs.\n\n\n\nHere are the questions he asked and what I answered:\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is TCP/IP?\n\nI explained that it’s a way devices communicate over the internet. I described the TCP handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and mentioned the four layers of the TCP/IP model.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is DNS cache flooding?\n\nI told him honestly that I didn’t know that part.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is the Data Link Layer?\n\nI said it converts data into frames and handles source and destination MAC addresses.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is the Physical Layer?\n\nI explained it converts data into electrical signals in cables and radio waves in WiFi.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is MITM and how is it performed?\n\nI said it’s when someone intercepts communication between two parties. I gave an example of public WiFi, explained how attackers can read or modify data if communication is not secure (like HTTP), and mentioned Wireshark for capturing network traffic.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is cryptography?\n\nI said it’s a method of protecting data using encryption. I explained symmetric and asymmetric encryption and gave examples like AES, DES, 3DES, and RSA.\n\n\n\nHe asked: Name web application vulnerabilities.\n\nI mentioned XSS, SSRF, and race conditions. When he asked to explain race conditions, I gave a banking example where multiple requests are sent before balance updates. For prevention, I said locking mechanisms or synchronization.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What tools are used in web app testing?\n\nI explained a workflow: recon with Nmap, directory fuzzing with Gobuster, subdomain discovery with ffuf, checking CMS vulnerabilities in Exploit-DB, and exploiting using Metasploit.\n\n\n\nHe said automated scanners can do everything. I responded that automation consumes more resources and cannot detect business logic flaws, which is why manual pentesting is needed.\n\n\n\nHe asked: How would you block a DDoS attack?\n\nI said using firewalls, temporary IP blocking, rate limiting, and monitoring through SIEM tools.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is Cloudflare?\n\nI said it works as a DNS service and proxy and mentioned its public DNS IP.\n\n\n\nHe asked: Do you know cloud security?\n\nI said no.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is SYN flooding and how to prevent it?\n\nI explained sending multiple SYN packets and mentioned prevention like rate limiting, IDS/IPS, and firewalls.\n\n\n\nHe asked: If many users share the same WiFi IP, how would you stop DDoS?\n\nI struggled with a precise answer.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is CSP and security headers?\n\nI said it’s a server policy header but didn’t know details. I also mentioned X-Forwarded-For and explained it tracks the original client IP behind proxies.\n\n\n\nAt the end, he said: “You only know the names, not the details.”\n\n\n\nThis is what frustrated me because I genuinely tried to explain concepts with examples wherever I could i even said fuck you(in my mind).\n\nI had applied for jr penetration testing role.",

It's pretty similar to what the job would be like if your company provides IR services to other customers/clients. You won't know wtf you're looking at. I've had maybe 5 clients out of hundreds proactively send us a network diagram and full picture of their environment including security relevant applications that are in use. It's almost always here's a few server images, we do our forensics and find XYZ, and then have to ask them if use XYZ, then they tell us XY is used, but Z isn't recognized, then we find Z on a few other hosts and everything keeps going from there. Theres a lot of back and forth between us as we slowly piece together findings, particularly for things where there can be both a legitimate and malicious use case and we don't know whether they're using it legit or not. \n\nI expect that part of those interviews involves you asking the interviewer questions of your own where you need additional context. But I would only expect someone aiming for a mid-senior level role to go through an IR interview like this. Entry level without prior industry experience would struggle with this kind of interview cos they lack actual hands on experience with real cases.

I'm more interested in hearing how they approach the problem as a whole. What do they consider? What don't they consider? What dont they know, and how do they tackle a problem they're not 100% sure how to solve?\n\nIMO, after establishing a baseline knowledge level, it's more important to see how someone handles a complex, unknown problem. Therefore I'll try to gauge where someone's skill level ends, then intentionally ask them questions beyond their capabilities. I'm not looking for the right answer; I'm looking for the right thought process even if it ends in the wrong or incomplete answer. You're going to run into a completely new-to-you problem eventually in this field. Therefore the problem solving process matters more than someone's ability to recall an answer perfectly.\n\nSo going back to my question earlier:\n\nIf they answer the question perfectly, I'll follow up with a harder question until we get to an area they're unfamiliar with. I do also tell them openly why I'm asking what I do and that I'd rather them try and give me the wrong answer than not try at all.\n\nIf they don't know how to answer the question perfectly, I'd want to see what they think about. I'll see if/how they try to approach things like network segmentation, hardening methods for the web server itself, IDS/IPS implementation, and most importantly the why and how of it all. \n\nFor me the worst answer is \"I don't know\", and the best answer is \"I don't know but I'd like to take a stab at it. I know x, and I think I can translate it to y using z...\" Again even if they're wrong, I get to see how they tackle a new problem to them.\n\nI'm of the opinion it's much easier to teach someone technical skills or knowledge they're missing than it is to teach someone how to think, research, or solve problems.",

I understand why–its part of the field.\n\nBut–from what you posted–I don't believe that person knew what they were doing. Sure you need to know the basics and you seem like you do and you are ready to admit when you don't know certain details. But to know everything from THEORY(which is stupid to begin with), on the spot (which let's be fair we all get some blanks when we're under pressure), and cannot prepare in advance? Yeah, not happening.\n\nMy guess? That person probably went on chatGPT or something similar and gave the prompt \"what questions should I ask as a interviewer for this job\" and there.\n\nAnyways, don't let this interview get you down. It's probably won't be the last one like it but eventually you'll get a nice job. Took me almost 4months before I finally got something good. So don't give up!",

Vehicle intelligence is the perfect example.\n\nYeah, this is probably one of the most scary applications of AI technology. Take every bit of information about browsing activities, cell phone data, marketing information... feed it as much data as you can. Feed it even the stuff that would usually be waaaaay too hard to use. Eventually you'll have very thorough profiles on every person, you'll have unbelievable leverage over them.\n\nThis is what US and Israeli intelligence and some private companies like Palantir are trying to do. They basically want to run something like a SIEM, except the logging is about people and they have the best AI analyzing all the data for them. Scary stuff. Doubly so when you realize just how in bed many of the private companies that have your data are with the US government and just how many of the people working in them are ex-Israeli intelligence.",

That's why the story is being covered up and partly why VIPs aren't being arrested. \n\nFor some basic background: Ehud Barak co-founded cyber intelligence company Toka, with retired IDF cyber chief, Brig. Gen. Yaron Rosen. \n\nEhud Barak had his own apartment on the 11th floor of 301 East 66th st. - Jeffrey Epstein's notorious townhouse.  The building was 1st owned by Leslie Wexner and also owned by Jeffrey Epstein's brother Mark. Ehud Barak and his bodyguards were seen regularly in the building. \n\nAround 2015 Epstein needed a favor from his high up Russian agent source named Belyakov, in return Epstein promised to help by linking them with Ehud Barak, and other VIPs. \n\n\"Epstein's end of the deal was recruiting Western elites to Putin's forums.\n\nHe promised to bring LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, Microsoft's Nathan Myhrvold, billionaire Thomas Pritzker, and former Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak.\"      Source: https://www.kyivpost.com/post/65602?\n\nArchived (free) link to Haaretz article: https://archive.ph/20260217155625/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/security-aviation/2026-02-16/ty-article-magazine/.premium/your-car-is-spying-on-you-and-israeli-firms-are-leading-the-surveillance-race/0000019c-6651-d2f0-a19c-7fdd81920000",

      "text": "The Feb 16, 2026 standoff between the Department of War (formerly DoD) and Anthropic signals a major escalation. This isn’t a simple contract dispute—it’s the construction of a **federated AI engine** that merges domestic and foreign intelligence, creating unprecedented attack surfaces.\n\n#### 1. The Blueprint: Artificial Intelligence Strategy for the Department of War\nThe Jan 9, 2026 memo [Artificial Intelligence Strategy for the Department of War](https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/12/2003855671/-1/-1/0/ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-STRATEGY-FOR-THE-DEPARTMENT-OF-WAR.PDF) establishes the **Wartime CDAO** with “Barrier Removal Authority,” allowing the legal bypass of any non-statutory privacy or safety protocols. This creates a single point of operational authority over highly sensitive data systems—an obvious **high-value target**.\n\n#### 2. The Mandate: DoD Data Decrees\nPage 4 of the memo centralizes all siloed data across the military into a **federated catalog** for “AI exploitation.” This merging of domestic and foreign intelligence eliminates natural segregation, increasing **insider risk**, **data leakage potential**, and the **blast radius of a compromise**.  \n\n#### 3. The Surveillance Engine: Project Grant (PSP #5)\nProject Grant is designed for **Pattern-of-Life correlation** and real-time predictive intervention. Its deployment means that **compromised models or data flows could allow automated targeting of individuals or infrastructure**, turning AI-driven analysis into a potential vector for **national-scale cyber operations**.\n\n#### 4. Legal Shield: TRUMP AMERICA AI Act (Jan 2026)\nThe Act (Sen. Blackburn) includes **Section 5 Federal Preemption**, eliminating state-level AI privacy protections. By operating on **federal land under NEPA exclusions**, the Department of War effectively removes standard legal oversight, creating **shadow operational networks** that bypass traditional security governance.\n\n#### 5. The Ultimatum: Anthropic as a Supply Chain Risk\nLabeling Anthropic a “supply chain risk” is a warning to all AI labs: **ethical refusal is not permitted**. Only AI models compliant with “all lawful purposes” survive. This **forces a homogenization of AI with zero safety checks**, creating systemic vulnerabilities across critical infrastructure.\n\n**Cybersecurity TL;DR:** The government is deploying a centralized, federated AI system with automatic Pattern-of-Life correlation, legal immunity from oversight, and enforced compliance from private labs. This is not just a privacy issue—it’s a **national-scale cyber risk** with enormous operational attack surfaces.\n\n**Verification Sources:**\n* [Memo Serial 2003855671](https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/12/2003855671/-1/-1/0/ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-STRATEGY-FOR-THE-DEPARTMENT-OF-WAR.PDF)  \n* TRUMP AMERICA AI Act (Jan 2026, Sen.

We're the Picus Labs Research Team, and we're here for an AMA.\n\nFor the **Red Report 2026**, we analyzed **1.1 million malware samples** and mapped 1**5.5 million malicious action**s to **MITRE ATT&CK** to understand what actually worked for attackers in the last year.\n\nThe headline shift is what we call the “**Digital Parasite**,” a move toward silent persistence, stealthy execution, and living longer in real environments, with credential theft now appearing in nearly 1 in 4 attacks and ransomware-style encryption trending down. \n\nWe are here to share what the data says, what surprised us, and what defenders can do next week. **Ask us anything about the methodology, top techniques, trends, or practical prevention and detection ideas.**\n\n**Key Technical Findings from the 2026 Research:**\n\n* We observed a **38% decrease** in encryption (T1486). Adversaries are trading \"loud\" ransomware for silent, long-term data extortion to stay undetected.\n* **80% of the top ten techniques** are now dedicated to evasion and persistence. If your security controls aren't hunting for **Process Injection (#1 for three years running)**, you're likely blind to persistent malware.\n* Sandbox evasion rose to **#4**. Modern malware like **LummaC2** now uses **trigonometry** to calculate the Euclidean distance of mouse movements to prove a human is present before execution.\n\n**Participants:**\n\n* **Dr. Suleyman Ozarslan**, Co-founder and VP of Picus Labs ([u/malware\\_bender](https://www.reddit.com/user/malware_bender/))\n* **Sıla Ozeren Hacioglu**, Security Research Engineer ([u/sila-ozeren](https://www.reddit.com/user/sila-ozeren/))\n* **Huseyin Can Yuceel**, Research Lead ([u/hcyuceel\\_picus](https://www.reddit.com/user/hcyuceel_picus/))\n\n[Proof Photos](https://imgur.com/a/jeKFo9a)\n\nWe'll be here on February 19, 2026, answering your questions.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* [Red Report 2026](https://7048931.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/7048931/Picus-RedReport2026.pdf)",

              "text": "**TL;DR:** Trigonometry isn’t required for malware to run, but it’s a clever anti-analysis upgrade that makes sandbox evasion much harder to fake by verifying realistic human behavior before dropping the payload.  \n  \nHi!! I would be overstating it if I said malware needs math to escape virtualization environments or sandboxes :)). What we are seeing now is that some families are starting to use trigonometry and similar calculations to make user-activity checks more granular and harder to mimic.\n\nWe are all familiar with the classic sandbox evasion tricks (I am pretty sure many of you have seen them before): checking for VM artifacts, looking at suspicious process names, validating system uptime, inspecting user directories, or simply waiting for basic mouse movement. *That part isn’t new.* The difference is the refinement. Instead of checking for movement, it checks for believable movement. It’s not about math for the sake of math, it’s just making sandbox evasion harder to realistically fake :)).\n\nHere is how LummaC2 executed this technique.\n\nThe malware repeatedly queries Windows for the cursor position using the `GetCursorPos()` function. It waits until the cursor moves at least once. Then, within a short time window, it records several cursor positions in sequence, pausing briefly between each check.\n\nEach recorded position is simply an `(x, y) coordinate` on the screen. When two consecutive points are connected, they form a line segment. The malware calculates the length of that segment using the standard `Euclidean distance formula` used to measure the distance between two points on a graph:\n\n`√((x₂ − x₁)² + (y₂ − y₁)²)`\n\nIt then calculates the angle between consecutive movement vectors using the dot product formula:\n\n`cos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A||B|)`\n\nThe resulting angle is converted to degrees and compared against a hardcoded threshold. If the directional changes between movement segments are small and consistent, the motion is considered smooth and human-like. If the angles are sharp or inconsistent, it suggests scripted or synthetic input.\n\nAutomated sandboxes often generate straight-line or low-complexity cursor paths. Human motion, even when attempting to move in a straight line, naturally contains micro-curves and gradual directional transitions. By mathematically evaluating curvature and smoothness, LummaC2 effectively adds a probabilistic filter to determine whether it is operating in a real user environment.\n\nSorry for the long reply!! :)",

As you pointed out in RR26, attackers have continued to rely heavily on infostealers in 2025 as well.\n\nThe strategy shift is pretty clear. Instead of encrypting everything and going straight to a ransom demand, many actors are staying inside the environment, quietly exfiltrating targeted data, and coming back with solid proof of theft as leverage. With that model working so well for them, we’ll likely keep seeing infostealers play a major role.",

This allows us to observe how malware behaves at scale without manually stepping through every binary.\n\nAfter collection, the core work is structured data analysis. We normalize behaviors, cluster similar patterns, and map recurring techniques to MITRE ATT&CK based on consistent procedural evidence. This is where experience in threat analysis and methodology matters more than raw tooling.\n\nLLMs play little to no role in the malware analysis itself. While they are useful for language tasks, they tend to overgeneralize and lack the procedural precision required for technique-level mapping. For the examples included in the report, we manually extract representative procedures and explain them step by step to ensure technical accuracy and clarity.\n\nIn short, automation for scale and traditional analytical methods for rigor.

Signature-based detection has always been effective when the artifact is stable and observable.\n\nThe challenge, as the report points out, is that modern malware activity increasingly prioritizes evasion and persistence over traditional payload delivery (with 80% of the top 10 now focusing on stealth, it is safe to say we are facing a **stealth epidemic** right now).\n\nTechniques like process injection, defense impairment, credential abuse (observed in 1 out of every 4 malware samples), and cloud/API misuse for stealthy data exfiltration, not to mention that 19% of malware now relies on application-layer protocols, *do not always leave static artifacts* that file-based rules can reliably match. \n\nBecause of that shift, relying *primarily* on YARA-style matching creates visibility gaps.\n\nRR26’s key findings favor a behavior-centric model, with a strong emphasis on *continuous validation*. It is not just about detecting techniques rather than samples or incorporating memory and identity telemetry, but about systematically and repeatedly validating implemented security controls against the most prevalent TTPs to clearly identify where they fail. That continuous validation component is critical, as it ensures defenses are not assumed to work but are actively proven against real-world adversary behavior.\n\nSo it is *less about YARA being obsolete* and more about it *being insufficient as a standalone practice* in the current threat landscape.",

          "text": "\"Spanish police arrested a hacker who allegedly manipulated a hotel booking website, allowing him to pay one cent for luxury hotel stays. He also raided the mini-bars and didn't settle some of those tabs, police say.\n\n\"This cyberattack was specifically designed to alter the payment validation system, and this is the first time we have detected a crime using this method,\" Spain's National Police told media outlets.\n\nThe man, a 20-year-old Spanish national, was arrested while staying at a Madrid hotel with a four-night reservation that carried a €4,000 ($4,716) price tag – unless you hacked the payment system, as this fraudster did.\n\nAccording to the cops, he stayed at this hotel several times, costing the business more than €20,000 ($23,608) in losses.\n\nPolice began investigating the suspect earlier this month after an unnamed online booking website reported suspicious activity. The transactions appeared normal, indicating the man paid the full amount – at first.\n\nDays later, however, when the site transferred the actual amount paid to the hotel, the payment-validation scam surfaced, indicating that the crook paid just one cent for rooms costing €1,000 ($1,179) per night.\n\nAdding insult to injury, police said that the man also consumed mini-bar bottles and sometimes left those bills unpaid, too. \n\nWhile he may be facing a free stay at a mini-bar free, unluxurious facility for his alleged crimes, we have an idea for his next big vacay, post-prison: an inflatable moon hotel.\n\nThe definitely-going-to-happen hotel, slated to open in 2032, requires a deposit of either $250,000 or $1 million. No word on whether GRU Space, the hotel's operators, have received any one cent deposits – yet.\"",

There are also plans to create a mobile app in a couple of months. So when I got the job they didn’t specify my role exactly, they just told me that I’d be cybersecurity guy. I’m also the only security guy. I asked for access to everything (code and AWS credentials) so that I can be like an Application Security Engineer/ DevSecOps, but they don’t want that. They just want me to just test their security from what’s visible on the outside. I used to work as a pentester in my previous company, which was basically a contracting firm. We would get short term contracts to pentest the network, cloud and applications of various companies. The engagements lasted like a month and was done mostly once a year for each company. So now I have a full time role at this startup and they want me to do pentesting, which I think takes just a few weeks then I’ll be free for some time till they fix the issues I found or add new features and I have to retest. This means I’ll have a lot of free time on my hands. So I wanted advice from this sub on what I should do on my company time or just the best advice in this situation. I’m fairly new to cybersecurity with just 2 years experience in pentesting\n\nTLDR; I’m the only security person at a startup. They don’t want to give me code access or AWS access. I expect pentesting will take a few weeks, leaving me with downtime while waiting for fixes and retests. With \\~2 years of pentesting experience, what should I focus on during that time to provide the most long-term value? Or what other advice would you give me?",

It’s not that they don’t care, it’s that if they don’t sell, the company might not exist long enough for perfect security to matter. A lot of companies harden things later when enterprise deals or compliance become a blocker.\n\nIf they just want external testing, do that well. With your downtime, build a lightweight roadmap toward something like SOC 2 or basic compliance readiness. Map gaps, outline phases, define quick wins like IAM hygiene, logging, backups, and basic policies.\n\nThat shifts you from potentially turning into “the pentest guy” to them thinking of you like their CISO.",

Security is typically an afterthought because \"nothing has happened yet\" which necessarily frames your job as preventative (except for in the case of red teaming where there is a bit more salient urgency) rather than something which will profit the company directly. Framing things this way shifts the mindset of people who don't think in the same way you do. To this end you can also begin framing any changes or processes as a path toward various certifications (SOC, ISO, Etc.) Which can have a direct relationship to company profit by opening up the TAM for the company quite a bit.\n\nHope this helps!",

Think vulnerability management process, incident response playbook, security awareness training. These are things they’ll eventually need, especially if they want enterprise customers or go through SOC 2, and right now nobody is doing them.\nOn the access issue, push back on this professionally. Not having code access as the only security person is genuinely limiting. You can’t do threat modeling, you can’t catch vulns before they ship, you can’t bake security into the CI/CD pipeline. Frame it as “I can find bugs after the fact or I can help prevent them from being introduced in the first place.” The second option saves them money. With the mobile app coming in a few months that’s a good opportunity to get involved earlier and propose being part of the process from the start.\nUse the free time to skill up too. AWS security specifically since that’s what they’re running on, AppSec tooling like SAST/DAST/SCA, maybe start studying for AWS Security Specialty or OSCP if you don’t have it yet. Two years in pentesting is a solid base but startups reward people who can wear multiple hats.",

That access conversation comes back around on its own once they see you're not just ticking boxes. Pushing for it now when you've barely started will just make people nervous.\n\nThe downtime thing. Ok this is where it gets interesting because most people would see this as a problem and it's actually the biggest opportunity you're going to get.\n\nHere's what I've learned about startups. Nobody is coming to give you a roadmap. Nobody is going to tap you on the shoulder and say \"hey here's what you should do next.\" That's not how it works.

The other one gets made redundant at the next funding crunch.\n\nSo use that time. Talk to the devs. Talk to the founders. Understand what's actually being built and where it's heading. If there's a mobile app coming in a couple months, go figure out what that means for your work and come back with a simple one pager. Nothing fancy.

Start building your mobile security testing methodology now so you are ready when it ships. Get comfortable with the OWASP MAS project -- specifically the MASVS for defining what to test and the MASTG for the actual testing procedures. Set up an Android testing environment with a rooted device or emulator, install Frida and objection, and practice on intentionally vulnerable apps like DIVA or InsecureBankv2. When the mobile app does land, you will want to cover the full surface: decompile the APK with jadx to review hardcoded secrets and API endpoints, test for certificate pinning (or the lack of it), check how they handle token storage (SharedPreferences vs EncryptedSharedPreferences vs the Android Keystore), and verify root/jailbreak detection if applicable. Most startups ship their first mobile app with almost no security controls, so you will likely find plenty to report. If you can demonstrate that value early, that is also your leverage to argue for code access and a proper AppSec role down the line.",

According to researcher “Celeste” the exposed code, which has now been removed, sat at a US government-authorized endpoint that appears to have been isolated from its regular work environment.\n\n> In those files, the researchers found details about the extensive surveillance Persona software performs on its users. Beyond checking their age, the software performs 269 distinct verification checks, runs facial recognition against watchlists and politically exposed persons, screens “adverse media” across 14 categories (including terrorism and espionage), and assigns risk and similarity scores.\n\n> Persona collects—and can retain for up to three years—IP addresses, browser and device fingerprints, government ID numbers, phone numbers, names, faces, plus a battery of “selfie” analytics like suspicious-entity detection, pose repeat detection, and age inconsistency checks.\n\nInformation leakage aside, it is depressing to see countries barrel towards China's mandatory identity link with online accounts.\n\nI had a friend back in college who said one of their friends in the PRC once criticized a local government official on social media. Police showed up at his doorstep the next day and took him away for several days of interrogation.",

It might not even be outright dismantling freedom of speech (or other rights), all it takes is spreading enough worries for people to self-censor and avoid discussing day-to-day societal issues.\n\nTime and time again we see examples of data breaches or badly built infrastructure, which means no single entity can be trusted to keep data safe, to not exploit the data, to not have bad actors access it, to not result in future harm.\n\nIt might be low risk to share your personal opinion today. In 10 years, someone might track you down because of that and drag you in front of a court. \n\nIt's never about today, it's about tomorrow. It's not about \"what if\", it's about \"when\".\n\nDiscord especially is very popular among various political groups and social movements. Not all of them are pedophiles or neo-nazis, I would even argue the vast majority are left leaning groups. \n\nBest worst case would be people being targeted for their political opinions in the near future, as governments turn their agencies into vindictive oppressive tools. Worst worst case would be people being executed.\n\nSociety is way too naive imho. Which is why we can't back down and allow such developments to happen and infiltrate our lives continuously. \n\nEven if there is a slight chance to improve and save lives thanks to complete surveillance, the sacrifice are still immense. So many innocent people are currently and will suffer just because the wrong people are in positions of power and are using every possibility to silence and dispose of anyone who isn't supporting human rights violations.\n\nWe are absolutely setting up a dystopian future if we continue down this path and there will be few options left to fight it, the more ground is lost.",

I mean, whoever wrote the FinSec portion either has a huge pile of resentment towards his early level CS teachers who taught him sorting or something shady is at least going on company side.\n\n I'm not saying necessarily that they're feeding the government shadow information, but definitely it's really concerning to see it implemented where it is. Data is valuable, and I wouldn't put it past a company to build themselves around a product only to find true value in the data they gained along the way.
