Worms and Trojans were widespread at every printing kiosk. One time, my classmate erased my homework from my thumb drive by inserting it into a PC I'd told him not to use because everyone knew it was full of encryption viruses. Both of us learned something that day.\n\nNow, almost everywhere you go is sterile. Even websites with pirated movies look like Netflix. \n\nYou're not exposed to small threats that were teaching you a lesson. And because of that, you don't build your immunity step by step. So when a real threat comes (nowdays they are much more serious since your entire life is online now), you don't recognize it anymore because you haven't seen anything like it before. And the damage done by the security breach is higher. \n\nAnyway, would be cool to see any research articles on the topic (all that I've seen before contradict each other lol)",

              "text": "This! I agree and I'll add that the 'appified' generations grew up mostly in environments with built-in guardrails (ie, iOS, Chromebooks in schools, etc) and encouragement to use them -- as children a tablet is the babysitter, the entertainmentin the car, time to 'keep them quiet when mom/dad need a break, story time before bed, etc. \n\nI was born in late 70's, been in IT my entire career, and did grow up with a brother and father that were into computers. Hell, we had a Commodore PET in early 80's -- that thing took cassette tapes!! Same as music cassettes, and took a good hour + to load a basic program. So I've seen the full evolution of home pc's and laptops, and an IT career that spanned military, banking, biotech, manufacturing, automation, and a few other sectors.\n\nI direct a few IT teams, including Cybersecurity and my employees run from mid 20's to early 60's. There is of course, generational differences, and I've observed that they do approach security very differently... the older guys (myself included) have a strong foundation in IT, so understanding how a security 'risk' (just using that as a general, catch-all term) functions and how an attack can traverse the network, etc. The fundamentals and in-depth knowledge are lacking... in part they don't have the historical knowledge, but they're not focused on gaining that. \n\nThe younger folks know that security is critically important, however, they lack the foundation and want to 'pass go' and get right into security and advanced concepts and leverage security tools. Their attention to security trends to drop off and fluctuate... granted these guys in particular are IT Support Engineers. In the Cybersecurity team, the younger guys tend to look at a more narrow scope -- for example, say the tool is priv-mgr/PAM, so they're not thinking about the big picture of Cybersecurity for the entire dept, company, etc. IMO that stems from early development using devices with those guardrails and closed environment. The older security guys tend to do the opposite and worry a lot about the entire infrastructure (even when not merited), lol. It's a different mindset entirely.",

IMHO, it's about having a (common) know-how in also related technologies.\n\nI'm born at the beginning of the 70's and has started as child with home-computers. And it was necessary to learn programming in Z80A-Asm, Basic, K&R C by it's own as well to learn how a computer, electronics works. And than I've studied higher electronics and communications technologies, specialized on programming. Later I've added IT-Management, Embedded Systems and applied math's.\n\nIMHO, it's awful for me that young engineers think that they know all about IT because they have grown up with this technology, but no longer interested in understanding how it works at all. I.e., what are the basics of communication technologies or know that distributed processing and databases are based on very old concepts (most from the 60's) or what is the math of cryptology, encipherment ...\n\nLike E.W. Dijkstra: ... with a few weak computers programming was a mild problem. Now, with strong and giant computers, programming bcomes a strong problem.",

Music and movies were not easily available like they are today so people pirated through p2p like Limewire, leading to a huge exploit vector for malicious actors, so you had to learn quick or get burned, and if you got burned you knew it instantly. Now, Trojans are more stealth stealing cookies or swapping clipboard for bitcoin stealing, back then it was more malicious or you’d be put into a botnet since there weren’t as many ways to make money off of the Trojans.\n\nAlso a huge thing that turned the tide I believe was Windows Defender, their anti virus actually became “decent” if not better than most, especially with the cloud analysis part, leading to most people being protected a lot better than before. Essentially, you do not need to open yourself up to opening possible executables anymore (since you can stream everything now), and if you do, it gets scanned by Windows Defender. \n\nPeople do not need to be as smart now as the attack vectors are less, built in anti virus that’s actually decent, and as long as you keep your stuff updated you likely won’t get a drive by download unless it’s a 0day. Now the biggest threat is phishing id say.\n\nI miss the days when you’d code an AOL/AIM booter to mess with your friends while your Metallica mp3s finished downloading. Simpler times.",

Nowadays, you can literally do anything in the cloud cheap or free, nearly every amazing technology is open source, you can \"hack\" to your heart's content in CTFs, etc. \n\nThis generation has an abundance that would have been completely incomprehendable to me. Younger generations (y/z/alpha) just don't have the same amount of dogged determination to get good at tech for techs sake. Not universally true of course, I absolutely worship some of the most wildly elite folks 20 years younger than me who have mad chops, but in sweeping generalities, I just wish younger generations were more proficient at tech and interested in deep learning.",

You might want to steer away from the freebies, though.\n\nInitially, many bought dozens of packs and emptied out the store with their billions in celebration of the hack, but Ubisoft has now shut down the marketplace to prevent players from potentially being banned for using illegal currency. It's the first step in putting out the wildfire spreading through the game right now, but popular content creators urge players to stay completely offline until the problem has been resolved.\n\n\"Do not log into your game, do not spend Renown, do not spend Rainbow Credits - that is my early warning to you,\" Twitch streamer and former pro player KingGeorge said in a new video. \"They have banned people in the past for their own screw ups. So, I would definitely recommend just not even logging into the game.\" Likewise, official Discord moderators suggest that you \"DO NOT spend\" any credits, as this could \"be interpreted as a breach of Terms of Service\".\n\nWhile the specifics on the hack are hazy, Ubisoft also issued an official statement earlier today, explaining that \"Our teams are working on a resolution\" and that it \"will share further updates once available\", so it's worth keeping an eye on the Rainbow Six Siege socials to stay in the loop.\n\nIt's unclear how much the hackers have access to, so it would be prudent to update passwords and remove any payment details affiliated with your Ubisoft account. At the very least, you should avoid the game until the problem has been resolved.\"",

Also, doesn't sound like there's going to be any formal seating, so have fun holding your laptop up while you're standing in a crowd. \n\nMy real answer: they probably don't want any amateurs being disruptive with electronic devices there that they can't track down. Normal cell phones can be tracked and identified. They could never stop an actual attacker with proper covert gear, but they can stop a bunch of children from DoS'ing equipment and being annoying.",

The political atmosphere around this election was charged to say the least, and it stands to reason that Mamdani’s inauguration could be a more interesting target for disruption than others. From the perspective of a naïve event coordinator, banning devices like F0 takes little effort and appears to have the effect of removing a large amount of possible disruptions, regardless of the reality that almost no one in any random crowd of 10,000 would ever have such a device with them. Unfortunately, like you said, it also doesn’t stop someone with actual ill intent.",

      "text": "I've spent the last decade in incident response, working across everything from 5-person joinery shops to multi-national retail enterprises. After cleaning up roughly 1,000 incidents, I naturally developed a bit of an intuition for knowing the difference between \"good security\" and \"good control coverage\".\n\nThe firms that survive incidents (and prevent them) are almost never the ones with the most tools or the biggest budgets. They were the ones who understood their resilience - where they'd actually break under pressure, and what that would cost them.\n\nA few things I've learned that changed how I approach assessments:\n\n**1. Compliance framing creates false confidence**\n\nCyber Essentials, SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc - you must understand that their sole purpose is to make it easier to do business with other companies. Executives sponsor these programmes because it will make them more money.\n\nThat might be by making their onboarding quicker, or shortening deal cycles when responding to RFPs, or just increasing consumer confidence.\n\nNone of it actually helps an organisation be more secure. At the best, I think it's fair to say that there's a small correlation between certifications and resilience, but it's absolutely not a casual relationship, just a pattern.\n\n**2. Clients respond to money, not maturity scores**\n\nNobody outside of security knows what \"Level 3 maturity\" means. But say \"you have a high insolvency risk from a major incident\" and suddenly you've got board-level attention. I frame all my assessments this way, even for small businesses.\n\nThe key principle to consider is that security programmes cost money. And for any commercial venture, money MUST provide a return on investment. If your recommendations don't make your client more money then they cost, why would they do it? I've known many enterprises that simply accept that they will have a major incident every 1-2 years, because the cost of transforming their security architecture would cost more than the impact of the incidents.\n\nThis is a totally valid position! And if you can help your client weigh up exactly what the pros and cons are, then you will quickly become one of their most trusted and valuable partners.\n\nThe trick, of course, is having the data and vocabulary to model the commercial implications.\n\n**3. The \"time to low risk\" metric changes the conversation**\n\nExecutive audiences don't understand CVSS scores, and are not going to read your 47 technical findings. Include them for context and for technical readers, but stick them in an appendix, and instead, lead with the programme required to get from their current state into an acceptable state.\n\nHow many months will it take? How much will it cost? Who will do the work? How do they measure success?\n\nThis completely changes the conversation, and transforms a scary report into an actionable project plan that your client will have confidence in sponsoring. You want your client to feel like they've been handed a solution, not a problem.\n\n**4. Periphery systems are where organisations actually die**\n\nCore infrastructure is usually fine - everyone's got M365, EDR, and MFA on their main systems now. If they've put one iota of effort into changing the defaults or have an MSP that does this for them, by and large they are in a great position.\n\nThe reason organisations like this still get hacked is because of the exceptions. Machines that don't have DfE on. Servers that have been missed from your asset register. An SSL VPN that no-one knew about.\n\nFixing these are often quick wins. Migrating might be a pain, but it's ultimately a short programme of work with a high reduction in risk.\n\n\\----\n\nI've put together a sample report that captures everything I've discussed above with a fictitious client. Here's the link: [https://analystengine.io/msp-assessment-sample](https://analystengine.io/msp-assessment-sample)\n\n**Transparent disclosure:** The site above does link to my cybersecurity startup focused on generating content like the above. That being said, the link above contains no CTA or sales material. I'm making the sample freely available as a resource for others to use how they see fit - and have added the required corporate flair to this post.\n\nI would love any advice or feedback on the report structure if anyone has thoughts on how to improve it!",

          "text": "Nice stuff there. For the GRC compliance issue in general, related to maturity levels, it really depends on the enterprise's tenor. Some enterprises really want to be more secure, in which case GRC efforts provide a roadmap and a yardstick for measuring progress. What most enterprises wish for, however, is a checkmark as a sales qualification, so they can sell into specific markets where security is a concern. For example, I can't tell you how many companies might say, \"We'll buy from you, but you need your SOC 2\" for enterprises where a SOC 2 isn't even appropriate, or they don't understand the difference between a SOC 2 Type I and II. Still, they will take a well-documented list of security controls over adequate security.",

But the assessment sample is hard to follow and I have a hard time wondering when, why, and how I'd actually put it to use. If it is for SMB, then stuff like software developent will most likely not be an item. I like the control assessment, compliance (if it applies), and findings section. But idk.. on the whole it seems very long and too wordy. In my experience SMB dont have the attention span for most of this stuff. Great as a deliverable if your trying to demonstrate value with a very long document, but how useful is it is what I always ask myself. How does any of this translate to the client to take action on? Feel free to disagree, but thats just my initial take.",

Most of the time the SMB is just the owner that doesnt really know what to do, so they hire the MSP to do this stuff. So, if the context is that you are the MSP doing a security evaluation, then a lot of this seems kinda unnecessary. Like, you are reporting to the owner on your own security work, etc. - and that could be drastically summarized in my opinion.   \nOtherwise, I'd ask who is this meant for? An IT manager, the owner? or the MSP if you are just the external security evaluator/auditor?    \nWhat is the high level overview of the findings, and some details on each category evaluated - then maybe some technical stuff to help guide whoever might actually implement changes/fixes.

SSL VPNs have seen some of the most 0day vulnerabilities on record, and these issues simply have not affected IPSEC implementations. \n\nHowever - in all the cases I’m aware of, adding MFA to the SSL VPN has been a mitigating measure. The vulnerabilities have only affected standard accounts with no second factor. This makes sense of course because your second factor will always involve a non-SSL identity component that’s much harder to spoof or break. \n\nThis means that the cheapest and most effective thing a client can do is just add MFA. Removing the implementation completely is a huge project and highly disruptive to working practices that are already comfortable with the current process. \n\nIn principle, I agree that IPSEC is the more secure implementation out of the two. But it doesn’t mean it’s the best advice to give a client if they’re stuck with an alternative solution.",

Since media site accounts are often older and less secured than banking accounts, users frequently reuse these passwords on more sensitive platforms, making this a prime source for Credential Stuffing attacks.\n\n\n- Sustained Threat (“Drip Feed”): The actor’s statement about future releases indicates an ongoing threat. This tactic is often used to extort the victim organization or to keep the hacker group in the news cycle. It means the initial leak may just be a “proof of concept,” with more sensitive data (like subscription billing details) potentially held back for later.\n\n\n- Web Infrastructure Vulnerabilities: The claim of “exploiting vulnerabilities” suggests that Wired’s public-facing websites—often running complex Content Management Systems (CMS) with numerous plugins for ads and tracking—contained unpatched security holes (e.g., SQL Injection or XSS) that allowed database enumeration.”\n\nFrom a link another commenter shared",

Or perhaps they have already completely remediated it and are just not disclosing yet.\n\n In my article, I included a screenshot of what my entry for WIRED showed.  \n\nI would note that, as far as I know, the security of the data is a Condé Nast responsibility, not a WIRED responsibility.

Interesting.\n\nIt seems that Bitwarden's alerts are backed by Have I Been Pwned and Bitwarden’s own breach-report logic, and they're designed to show up right where you’re working rather than waiting for you to open a reports screen.\n\n1Password's Watchtower’s Compromised websites list is driven by a curated breach database (heavily influenced by Have I Been Pwned and other feeds), not by every raw leak that shows up in threat‑intel or dark‑web scraping tools. It appears that new breaches are generally showing up in Watchtower only after they're confirmed, structured, and added to those feeds, which might lag days, weeks, or longer.\n\nLooks like Bitwarden has the edge on this one.",

No alerts from them, no stories on Krebs/The Record/Hacker News, nothing on dark web dumps either.\n\nThose \"digital footprint scanners\" (especially the free or cheap ones) are notorious for false positives—they sometimes scrape old unrelated leaks, misattribute domains, or just flag anything with \"wired.com\" in credential dumps (which could be reused creds from totally different breaches).\n\nSince you already rotated creds, you're good. If you're really worried, keep an eye on HIBP (it updates pretty fast for real leaks) and maybe toss your Wired email into their notification list.\n\nProbably just a scanner glitch, but better safe than sorry!",

Hiring someone else is not carte blanche to not give a fuck. Ubisoft has enough technical resources to be expected to vet a contractors processes and policies for handling data, more than enough technical know-how to be held liable in the case of a breach. It might be different for small businesses or solo, non-technical workers who don't have the capacity or knowledge to assess a vendor's security practices. But Ubisoft is not such an organization.\n\nIn this case it's probably not relevant unless actual consumer data or payment methods are shown to be compromised due to the outsourcing, but your statement is just wrong.",

          "text": "\"A new sample of the ToneShell backdoor, typically seen in Chinese cyberespionage campaigns, has been delivered through a kernel-mode loader in attacks against government organizations.\n\nThe backdoor has been attributed to the Mustang Panda group, also known as HoneyMyte or Bronze President, that usually targets government agencies, NGOs, think tanks, and other high-profile organizations worldwide.\n\nSecurity researchers at Kaspersky analyzed a malicious file driver found on computer systems in Asia and discovered that it has been used in campaigns since at least February 2025 against government organizations in Myanmar, Thailand, and other Asian countries.\n\nEvidence showed that the compromised entities had prior infections with older ToneShell variants, PlugX malware, or the ToneDisk USB worm, also attributed to state-sponsored Chinese hackers.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, the new ToneShell backdoor was deployed by a mini-filter driver named ProjectConfiguration.sys and signed with a stolen or leaked certificate valid between 2012 and 2015 and issued to Guangzhou Kingteller Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nMini-filters are kernel-mode drivers that plug into the Windows file-system I/O stack and can inspect, modify, or block file operations. Security software, encryption tools, and backup utilities typically use them.\n\nProjectConfiguration.sys embeds two user-mode shellcodes in its .data section, each executed as a separate user-mode thread to be injected into user-mode processes.\n\nTo evade static analysis, the driver resolves required kernel APIs at runtime by enumerating loaded kernel modules and matching function hashes, rather than importing functions directly.\n\nIt registers as a mini-filter driver and intercepts file-system operations related to deletion and renaming. When such operations target the driver itself, they are blocked by forcing the request to fail.\n\nThe driver also protects its service-related registry keys by registering a registry callback and denying attempts to create or open them. To ensure priority over security products, it selects a mini-filter altitude above the antivirus-reserved range.\n\nAdditionally, the rootkit interferes with Microsoft Defender by modifying the configuration of the WdFilter driver so it is not loaded into the I/O stack.\n\nTo shield injected user-mode payloads, the driver maintains a list of protected process IDs, denies handle access to those processes while the payloads are executing, and removes protection once execution completes.\n\n\"This is the first time we’ve seen ToneShell delivered through a kernel-mode loader, giving it protection from user-mode monitoring and benefiting from the rootkit capabilities of the driver that hides its activity from security tools,\" says Kaspersky.\n\nThe new variant of the ToneShell backdoor that Kaspersky analyzed features changes and stealth enhancements. The malware now uses a new host identification scheme based on a 4-byte host ID market instead of the 16-byte GUID used previously, and also applies network traffic obfuscation with fake TLS headers.\n\nIn terms of the supported remote operations, the backdoor now supports the following commands:\n\n0x1 — Create a temporary file for incoming data\n\n0x2 / 0x3 — Download file\n\n0x4 — Cancel download\n\n0x7 — Establish a remote shell via a pipe\n\n0x8 — Receive operator command\n\n0x9 — Terminate shell\n\n0xA / 0xB — Upload file\n\n0xC — Cancel upload\n\n0xD — Close connection\n\nKaspersky advises that memory forensics is key in uncovering ToneShell infections backed by the new kernel-mode injector.\n\nThe researchers have high confidence in attributing the new ToneShell backdoor sample to the Mustang Panda cyberespionage group. They assess that the threat actor has evolved its tactics, techniques, and procedures to gain operational stealth and resilience.\n\nThe cybersecurity company provides in its report a short list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) to help organizations detect Mustang Panda intrusions and defend against them.\"",

Also, I have been at this company for about 6 months now which is also why I am little hesitant on trying to move in general lol\n\nHere are some of the things I did.\n\nSetting up Microsoft Defender EDR, AV, whitelist softwares all from scratch for each department.   \nAutomation of user being assign to a device in Intune/Entra.\n\nAccess control(IAM + PIM), Sharepoint, Teams are all my domain as well within Microsoft GCCHIGH. \n\nSet up Purview's DLP, labeling policy, etc as well. I also do remediation through Huntress SIEM etc. \n\nNow this MSP will be taking over most of the Microsoft related things. Defender EDR will be fully removed(which I am kind of sad about since that was my first solo project and was my baby)and MSP is brining in Sentinel one. I will not have access nor will I get the alerts. We will still run Huntress for internal things.\n\nThe only thing that MSP won't be able to touch are things that will be touching CUIs. Currently, I am setting up a shrepoint where CUIs will live and users will not be allowed to download or screenshot the document.   \nWith that said, sharepoint, exchange, and Teams will remain as my domain, which is not enough to keep me as a M365 sysadmin so they are willing to move me laterally. \n\nGiven my experience, what do I even move to? Am I just kicking the can of being let go down the road by moving lateral?   \n",

          "text": "Big oof all around - but it sounds like your company is running headlong into being fucked. \n\nFor context, my role is as the Compliance Officer at an MSP focusing on CMMC. We have our Level 2 and have taken multiple clients through their own respective journeys. \n\nQuestion - is that Sharepoint library in the 365 tenant your new MSP is in? \n\nUnless you're building an enclave with VDI, conforming to the VDI requirements in the Level 2 scoping guide, as clarified in the DoD CMMC FAQ from November, those endpoints are still in scope. Per the scoping guide, that MSP, assuming they have admin to the tenant and/or those CUI endpoints is ALSO in scope. Knowing the MSP industry, they're likely not adhering to the CMMC requirements as an ESP which will tank your audit, and when 171 Rev 3 eventually becomes the backbone of CMMC, they outright get required to meet 800-171. \n\nNot only that, but the documentation package the org will need is extensive. Our 365 baseline config documents solely for the 365 tenant is dozens of pages, not to mention endpoint baselines, procedures, policies, etc. Hell, the SSP I just had assessed for a 3 person enclave was over 200 pages. Your average MSP sucks at documentation to begin with, much less documentation that meets all 320 assessment objectives of 171.\n\nNow here's where you have options - you can deff leverage the cert program to upskill and bounce, but if you like your org and culture, you can attempt a pivot to GRC. An MSP is simply not able to deliver CMMC to an organization without someone in the organization taking point on key items (policies, ensuring org responsible procedures are in place, etc.) Any MSP that says otherwise is full of shit. \n\nIf you go the GRC route - the fast track to being your internal CMMC point person would be to try to get the CCP certification from the Cyber AB. This covers the CMMC program with enough depth to fill the role as a SME on the topic, without getting into technical specifics and leaving some room for interpretation. \n\nIf you decide to bounce - your experience in IAM and 365 within the DiB is a hot item and gives you potential leverage with other DiB contractors (or even other MSPs within the DiB.)",

They're the official CMMC ecosystem conference and have CCP trainings as an add on. The wealth of info there is significant and a great way for you to dive into the ecosystem. This can help you build some connections (aka future job prospects) but also give you some killer knowledge to help your org. \n\nYou can also suggest this to your MSP as there are always MSPs there who have done what they're trying to do.

I've spoken to a few auditors about this. Very easy for metadata containing CUI to end up in a SIEM, and if Huntress isn't using SentinelOne's FedRamp tenant then that is going to be a painful audit. Not to mention ticketing, which is also often overlooked. There are some MSP's that I've talked to that were going to move their ticketing system back to on-prem just because of the CUI that was leaking into it.\n\nI don't think it would be good for you to start throwing stones in this glass house to point out the above, but it would be good for you to position yourself to be the technical SME for the audit. There will be plenty to do before you get certified, and the experience will be invaluable. DLP in itself seems like it would take up some time with investigations, unless your company is only touching CUI sporadically.\n\nI would love to know what the Huntress SOW states as it seems there are some major gaps in how this is supposed to work. In the end they will be using you to learn a very expensive lesson.",

Or look for programs that will take your work.\n\nYet, remember: getting paid is not the only reason to do what you do. There is challenge, fun or because it's just a good thing to do.

              "text": "So I think you are misunderstanding how this works in tech and art.\n\nThe tech world runs on work that is not directly compensated, and has from the beginning. The most important pieces are created and distributed to everyone for free. Incredibly talented people with incredibly specialized skills spend massive amounts of time and effort working without any direct payment to create the stuff that makes the internet and most computing possible.\n\nBut it is incorrect to think about this as unpaid labor, or even as volunteer work. Because the flipside of people doing this is that the ones doing this work are the ones who control how this stuff works. In other words, contributing in this way gives you a level of ownership over this tech that the world uses.\n\nAnd that is a form of workers owning the means of production.\n\nNow, a person doesn't have to care about that or place value in that. But the people who produce this stuff *do* value it, and they are the ones doing the work to create and maintain the stuff we all use, and so long as that is the case this is the way it will work. So that is why so much tech work is uncompensated -- nobody owns it because it is maintained collectively, so there isn't anybody who has money to pay someone or the authority to uplift someone for their contribution the way OP seems to want.\n\nNote: this applies to open source stuff. In terms of proprietary tech, it is a little different. If a company does indeed own something, and benefits from any work that increases the value of the thing they own (and fixing vulns definitely increases the value of something), then I would agree that people should get paid for that (either via fee or via equity in the thing whose value they improved). \n\nBut unfortunately the way the law currently works gives those companies ownership over their tech, and ownership gives the owner the right to do even very stupid and wasteful things with their tech. Thus, there are companies that decide that they aren't willing to pay for vulns, and in that case you can choose what you want to do instead, but you really can't force them to pay you for it. This is one of the weaknesses of proprietary tech vs open source -- proprietary tech can be run by a handful of idiots in a much more foolish fashion, whereas open source can be used however anyone wants to use it, and because most people are cool and smart the consensus tends to be much better on average than what a handful of rich assholes decide to do.\n\nI think the reason so many people still tend to default to disclosure for free and have formed a system of ethics on that is because the line between \"open source\" and \"proprietary\" really is quite thin in a lot of cases. Also, a lot of the people who work on this stuff also have jobs at companies that themselves use the open source tech, and so it is often in their interest to fix the open source tech for everyone as well as themselves, and the culture of tech has arrived at a sort of reciprocal understanding on this -- you may not get paid for one specific contribution, but you also won't have to pay for all kinds of future benefits you will receive from other people doing the same, and ultimately everybody gets more by just giving and trusting then by trying to keep track of each individual little thing.\n\nAnd this is where we see the actual comparison to the art world: when you contribute for free to tech products, you aren't contributing to the owners of the tech but rather to your colleagues / fellow tech workers. Like, a vulnerability in Exchange has the potential to cause massive problems for lots of tech workers, and so if you can find and fix that vuln you are saving them a *lot* of work.\n\nSimilarly, artists are generally pretty supportive towards each other, and willing to share leads and techniques and information and collaboration between themselves because they know they all benefit. Like, if I have the chance to share a technique of mine with someone else, that isn't me \"working for exposure\" -- that is me doing a favor for a peer. And if that becomes the expectation in the professional culture then I stand to learn *lots* of techniques from others for free. Also, because I helped that person, there is a good chance that they will try to return the favor at some point in the future. And even if one person doesn't, if you give relatively freely you will get enough benefit back to make it worth your while because people are, overall, more good than bad.\n\nAnother way to look at it: artists are artisans, who make things via their craft and sell it to customers, and who have a mutual interest in supporting each other and the profession as a whole because it helps *everyone*.\n\nThis is different from a servant style job, like a factory worker, where you are performing tasks at somebody's request but don't have any kind of ownership of the product or the process. You are just doing what you're told to do.\n\nAnd in this fashion, tech workers are and should think if themselves as artisans, not servants. We own our craft and sell our services to clients (aka employers), but *we* own the tech. We aren't just blindly doing what bosses tell us do, or surrendering everything we make to them and letting decide how much we get for it or what is and is not valuable -- we decide that for ourselves.\n\nAnd when you think of it that way, responsible disclosure (even for free) isn't just a nice thing to do -- it is actually in your material interest because it supports your craft and colleagues, who also support you, in your mutual goal of getting companies to pay you for tech services.",

It's much more ethical in a bounty format than, say, how internships are structured.

The commonality among governance, risk, and compliance is they are all strategic in nature, meaning they are mostly in the hands of the senior level of an organization (e.g., board or ownership). While there are components that are operational, that's mostly the box checking, the data collection. Translating that data into an actionable strategy, however, takes a lot of experience and general business acumen.  Whether addressing GRC in a third-party role (auditing or consulting) or internally, it can be very challenging because you end up sandwiched between a senior level that might not respect your strategic insight and operational employees who don't think you have the technical chops. This is why, in my experience, the people who are effective in the job tend to have pretty deep resumes.",

And now, I am going to grab an excerpt from an article I wrote in response to this:\n\nYou need to see what it really takes to get your compliance initiative off the ground, so that you can be sure that your team of engineers can actually pull off what you're going to put on them.\n\nWhat will you have to say when a customer asks you a tough question that requires actual hands-on knowledge? Ask the engineers you tasked with an assignment without actually knowing whether or not the job was done correctly? I couldn’t fathom being responsible for building or managing (and attesting to the deliverables from) a team of cybersecurity professionals if I didn’t have some form of hands-on experience in what I was managing. Most people work their way up to management from said trenches; whereas they have developed, through trials and tribulation, the skills necessary to guarantee a good job is done.\n\nHaving hands-on experience sifting through logs or applying procedure to policy hints at a much deeper degree of understanding and capability. This is what companies are really looking for today. Not a master of theory. Not a pencil pusher. A practitioner. A doer. They want someone they can trust.\n\nWhen you are getting a job in cyber, you are being trusted to handle the most sensitive aspects of a business. If all you have is some theory and limited experience with online lab exercises, but you’ve “never actually touched a router” or applied a ZTA framework to a network design (or even used a console cable) then how can you expect a business to take you seriously and entrust the physical routers and their actual IT infrastructure to you when you are supposed to “know this stuff” inside and out? Are they supposed to just trust that you can provide legitimate attestation of compliance that would stand up to scrutiny or hold up in a court of law? Audits must be verified, because there are times when automated scans will come back missing key information about infrastructure or services, or cannot be performed on sensitive architecture.\n\nYes, we have jobs that don’t require you to physically touch things, but these all require skills that in of themselves will expose you to what you would have seen in your own lab anyways. Being prepared; knowing what you are looking at; is worth gold. With hands-on experience, you won't just know what it really takes to get a stack up to snuff, you'll know how to prove it was done correctly. You won't be able to do that otherwise.\n\nEnd excerpt. With all that being said, GRC is not a beginner-friendly job because, as I mentioned in the trials and tribulations bit, you need to know what it really looks like to take a system, harden it, apply policy that aligns with an organizational goal, and provide legitimate attestation of compliance. It is more suited for people that value a desk job more than the thrill of the chase, and people tend to loathe auditors.

A lot of companies 15-20 years ago had the bare minimum to perform audits and coordinate with regulatory bodies. Since then a lot of places built out whole departments for GRC or hired groups of contracts to lay the groundwork. I started 8 years ago with a group of contractors and only had a CS degree with no prior job experience that was relevant. Now you’re competing against people with masters degrees at minimum along with 5+ years experience. I would say the threshold to meet to get a job in GRC is low relative to other more technical roles. It’s competing with other people for positions that makes it hard. Plus a lot of positions get filled internally since they already know the company.  If I had to do it over again I would probably start with general IT support and transition to networking or sysadmin work before getting into GRC.",

You will have almost zero opportunity to fix something that isn't a process or procedure.

They often won't be trained very well on whatever tool they're using, they'll often claim that \"managing\" the vulnerability is on the owners of the system, not on their team as they just report them.   I've been at numerous big orgs at this point and it's the same story - vuln management just reports, doesn't fix.   And they'll almost never be able to do the report you want.  \n\nThird Party Risk Management - no offense to the TPRM folks in the crowd, but I've never met another team that acts like managing the relationship with a vendor through surveys is the most grueling thing they've ever done in their life.  My main friend in TPRM sends me messages almost every day about how he didn't wake up until noon and no one came looking for him.  The other people on his team show up and leave at all hours and no one cares.  It's absolutely fucking mind blowing to me.

I lied and taught myself basic risk management about15 years ago and got near cybersecurity for a few years before finally getting into one of the biggest and most advanced info sec groups in Fintech. I got into is ass backwards and by never turning down an opportunity. It is not easy an easy role. You are judging your company and colleagues. Some places are more check the box than others. Even those places aren’t easy. Some places turn you into an ethical hacker (your best places will do this).\n\nGRC requires an understanding of network security, cloud, threat intel, vulnerability management, IAM, firewall, and so much more. Now add on AI that nobody understands - On top of that, you have to work within a framework like NIST or ISO. Now add any government regulations that may apply - and if you’re a global company add in things like GDPR or DORA. \n\nEvery shop I’ve been at, we’ve hired GRC people with at least 10 yrs of experience in the info sec including CPAs (they have a great skill set of sniffing out BS and scrutinizing and may come into the field by way of audit). Most come to it, in my experience, by way of Audit or being on a small risk management team. At least in FinTech. \n\nWant any more information, reach out.",

As well as watching webinars and the like I participate in formal discussions, speak at conferences, contribute papers and editorial articles, and the like. I did a two-hour training session for my Board a few weeks ago, for instance, and as well as providing valuable insight for them it also counts to my CPE.\n\nI do advise cyber professionals to “socialise” (terrible jargon, sorry) with senior management the concept of the need to retain your professional qualifications. They won’t think twice about their HR director or CFO needing to retain their memberships/fellowships of their professional bodies, so gently point out to them that it’s just as important in our industry and that to allow you some time to develop yourself is just as valuable to them as it is to you.",

          "text": "They would show a baseline, but it is an important baseline.\n\nIn the last company I worked for, I was part of the hiring team, and I designed the technical interview process. A lot of times, when you are hired with a company, you will see a requirement in the JD to be certified for a given technology or process within 90-180 days of hire. This means those of us on the hiring team cannot expect every single employee to hold an active certification for a given thing, so we have to find a way to ensure the candidates in front of us know what they are doing.\n\nHere is how I did it:\n\n* Question 1: Do you hold an active certification for \\[thing\\]\n* Question 2: Do you have any experience with \\[concept\\], and how confident are you with that skill?\n\nI would then proceed to ask questions based on those answers. The point of asking about the cert first is because the questions I asked were structured in a way where the employee could use their direct experience with a product or process to solve a real problem we were facing, without us giving away what that problem might be. But what if they were certified for something unrelated to what you use? Or worse, what if they were certified for what you do use but had no real experience with it? How could you tell?\n\nLet's say they come from a background that uses a type of technology in a different way, such as an AWS architect being hired in a company that has a focus on Azure, or a tech support rep that has used Solarwinds but has never used ServiceNow. A Helpdesk technician would not need to tell me how to submit a ticket in ServiceNow, but they would know how the ticket submission and escalation process works. I use general words like \"I have a ticketing system, and I have an irate employee that claims they got an email saying their ticket was completed but the work wasn't done. What would you do next?\"   \n  \nA certification doesn't teach you something like that.\n\nConversely, a cloud architect wouldn't need to know product names or license types in Azure as much as they would need to understand what concepts are used to solve real problems. Things you learn about through exposure to a real problem, or by having to find a solution. You learn the \"tricks of the trade\" and you can describe not only the what the thing is, but why or how it is used in a certain way; and that is precisely what we want. Have you ever been asked a trick question and felt embarrassed afterwards?\n\nThis is why I always asked the second question about experience. The benefit of doing it this way is you can find good candidates even of they don't hold a certification, and you can find bad candidates that have illustrious credentials but don't actually know how to manage the thing they hold a cert for. By asking trick questions, you create a hostile environment in an interview. By posing your questions in the two-part format like this, the trick is hidden behind a requirement to apply their knowledge in a practical way.\n\nA lot of folks will have a certification for something, but not always a lot of practical experience, so when I hit them with the next round of questions, it would require that they understood how to solve a problem in whatever way they understood how to, or by using a method they were familiar with. It proves whether or not you understand the fundamental concepts of how something works or how something is done, and didn't just memorize a cert dump. It also means you would not need to be certified to prove you know it!\n\nIf I ask you a question related to a product or license type, you might rattle off something you learned in a cert prep. But if I ask you how you would use that same thing in a creative way to solve a problem, or hit you with a question that required you to know how it is used and what for, your answer would tell me whether or not you actually understand what you hold a cert for, and vice versa. A person who answers correctly but does not hold a cert can still be hired, and a person who holds a cert but answers incorrectly will not.\n\nTo answer your question: I know this was wordy, but I did it like this on purpose. HR treats a resume like a filter; so even though I don't require you to be certified to be interviewed for a role, a lot of times that is the only way you will get in front of the hiring team in the first place.\n\nHope this helps.",

I have the full CompTIA cyber stack, the CISSP, several Microsoft azure certs, responsible disclosures, and director-level experience in security architecture. Just because HTB claims their products help you meet a supposed standard, it doesn't mean the company you're applying to will care.\n\nIn reality it is just like you said; great foundations, probably won't help you shine on a job application. The Ec-Council ECIH used to be a shoe-in for DF roles, but the court of public opinion and the mob sought to tear them down over the last few years. Most companies have defaulted to putting something from GIAC in their preferred qualifications list.\n\nWe have painted ourselves into quite the corner with our \"cybersecurity skills gap\" bellyaching. Ever since the headlines began to circulate, people looked at the gap as a way to make money, not as an opportunity to solve a problem. This is where the bootcamp-for-a-buck programs popped up, and everyone began scraping each other's YouTube videos and rebranding it as their own. Even HTB did this; it is how their certs started. \n\nHTB used to just be black boxes and hacker ranks. That was it. And it was good. But when they saw the community's response, where anyone that offered a paid cyber certification did so with the same promise of success and turned the skills gap into a money grab, they followed suit and  today the industry is saturated with a billion people that have a good amount of experience across a multitude of platforms and technologies but cannot find a job.",

Some people use test dumps and it devalues the experience of studying for the certification test and the certification itself. Doing whatever it takes to pass the exam is losing sight of the purpose of the cert.\n\nIn my opinion the trifecta’s weight depends on the individual’s amount of experience in the IT field. I think it’s a huge point of pride for newbies and junior technicians to get their certs but past a certain point it’s moot. CompTIA’s certs are largely geared for entry/junior level with one or two geared closer to mid-level professionals. Mid-level professionals should have their foundational knowledge pretty well solidified so the trifecta won’t do too much in regards to helping the certificate holder unless it’s a job role requirement, like in government IT positions. \n\nA few years ago I took CASP+ on a whim to validate my knowledge and it helped a bit when it came to my job at the time, but now it’s largely a piece of paper posted behind my desk. It was a huge point of pride when I passed and I think that was the biggest positive impact it had for me, well that and lessening my imposter syndrome.",

They are very foundational, but if you learn the material, I would definitely know that you could sit in a meeting/call with more advanced folks and be able to keep up. May not know everything they're talking about or the how/why, but you'll be able to know what's going on. I feel that's a huge deal and great for learning and growing. I've had IT Directors that really should have taken those certs so they didn't embarrass themselves and our team trying to talk to other people. Just knowing the basics (and your own limits that you don't know everything) can really help you communicate and be a part of the conversation and understanding things.\n\nPlus, it's a great start to a career.

AI *is*  helping in a lot of ways. \n\nBut the more I dig into it the more it feels like ai is also creating just as many problems as it’s solving.\n\nSome reports say 13% of companies have already experienced AI related security incidents and 97% of them admitted they dont even have proper ai access controls in place. That’s… not great.\n\nAnd i feel like most ai security features still seem like slightly improved versions of what we already have.\n\nSo I keep asking myself: what ai capability would actually change the game for cybersecurity?\n\nwhat's your suggestion on this?",

The black box nature of LLM leaves me questioning why an alert went off. Like why does it compute that this is malicious. \n\nI think that AI could have a possibility of helping if it is augmented with all the relevant information such as employee dept and title and if it was baselined with about 5 years of normal activity within your environment. \n\nSo far I have seen a lot of sloppy AI work. I believe that it still needs humans to check what it's doing. \n\nIf anything it's helped the offense more than the defense. Fixing the grammar and spelling for phishing emails but there's still things that I spot in phishing that AI hasn't fixed yet.

Better writing, more persuasive emails, etc. Video and voice emulation is probably going to start changing the way we trust videoconferencing, but it'll mostly be at the whaling level since it requires real-time attention by the attacker.\n\nOn the employment side of things, expect to see companies trying to get by with fewer low-end analyst jobs. My advice there is essentially unchanged, however, which is that trying to get an \"entry level cybersecurity job\" is generally a bad idea. Get a helpdesk position, develop a thorough understanding of how computers and networking works when it's not under attack, then pivot into cybersecurity once you have a few years under your belt.\n\nFrom a product perspective, expect every company to claim AI is now powering their software. That will mean wildly differing things and should mostly be ignored. Consider whether the resultant product functions well or not, same as ever.\n\nIn terms of \"how will companies allow their employees to interact with LLMs?\", expect places to settle on single solutions that they pay to not incorporate queries into training data. So, you'll have Microsoft shops that require you to use Copilot, Google shops are 100% in on Gemini, etc.",

It's functionality that's only recently been released and is only available for now through the web-based Gemini, though I expect it will be rolled out to the app in time. I'm still learning how to get the most out of it but so far I'm loving it. It took me a bit of time to populate my notebooks with the content I want (e.g. NIST frameworks & SPs, ISO-2700X, relevant regulations, CISA advisories, articles/white papers from organisations like Mandiant, Dragos etc, YouTube video transcripts from the likes of SANS and a few books by trusted authors. So now when I ask Gemini something I know it's using resources that I trust and hallucinations are pretty much a thing of the past. I can also get Gemini to use my notebooks in combination with wider Internet research if I want to.",

These agents screenshot challenges, send to GPT-4V/Claude, and get exact click coordinates back. reCAPTCHA and Turnstile weren't built for this.\n\nThis statement suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of reCAPTCHA and Turnstile.\n\nBoth reCAPTCHA and Turnstile can be configured to operate invisibly, both have made the decision whether or not to issue a token before the user ever interacts with it, and in case the site operator decides to make them display a widget or an interactive challenge, it is mostly for cosmetic/UX reasons and doesn’t meaningfully change the results. \n\nModern CAPTCHAs primarily use signals from your browser, your IP reputation history, your browsing activity (including on other websites) as seen by their network, and for Google, whether you’re logged into a Google account and the internal reputation score of that account. \n\nThat is also why any self-hosted CAPTCHA will never be as good, because you simply don’t have access to the same kind of signals across millions of different websites that Cloudflare and Google do.\n\nIf you don’t believe me, just try it for yourself on a known tainted IP address/blocked browser signals: simply Tor browser and try to pass a reCAPTCHA. Good luck.\n\nOr alternatively, look at it from an economic POV: the prices of bulk reCAPTCHA or Turnstile solves hasn’t meaningfully gone down with the introduction of vision AI or LLMs.",

That's not what FCaptcha is designed for.\nVision AI agents (Claude Computer Use, OpenAI Operator, etc.) are a different beast:\n\n-They control real browsers, not headless instances\n\n-They run from clean residential IPs or the user's own machine\n\n-They have no automation fingerprints - no webdriver flag, no Puppeteer artifacts\n\n-They can be logged into real Google accounts\n\nIt's a totally different game.

Usually the spammer or bot developer isn’t trying to do it themselves. There are browser plugins that will simply replace the widget code with a form element containing a valid solution token. There is no way to really block it entirely because it’s still a real person solving the captcha, all you can do is make it expensive enough that the attacker moves onto another target.\n\nResidential IPs can’t be recycled infinitely, it is a finite resource. Residential IP reputation like any other IP can be tainted too, if a particular residential IP is seen solving an abnormally large amount of captchas eventually you’ll get blocked.\n\nAttackers don’t have an infinite amount of aged Google accounts. If one Google account is seen solving a large captchas in a short period of time you’ll stop getting solution tokens.",

      "text": "I have been having a thought for several months now that has so far not left my mind, and it may go a long way in explaining the recent lack of security that Dark Web Marketplaces have been facing.\n\nCurrently, some sources estimate that between 25% - 60% of TOR relay nodes are run by the US government or other allied states and their respective intelligence agencies. Some nodes are run in Russia or China, but these nodes, while unlikely to be tracked by US or EU authorities, are less common. \n\nIn addition to this most exit nodes are in known and controlled locations such as universities, and as such should be assumed to be under surveillance at all times. \n\nThis means that the only real line of defense, is the user's selection of an entry node, which can be selected manually, but more often than not is randomly selected, and therefore we can assume that it has the same security as a relay node.\n\nLet us therefore do some math to determine how likely it is that any given connection to the TOR network would result in the user being completely deanonimized:\n\nEntry Node: 25% Compromised\nRelay Node: 25% Compromised\nExit Node: 90% Compromised\n\nUser Compromise Chance: 5.6%\n\nUsing this basic napkin math we can assume that a user who connects 20 times to the TOR network is almost certain to have been deanonimized during one of those connections. It only takes once for an identity to be revealed.\n\nThere are further protections that can be placed here, such as bridges. But bridges are limited and severely slow down connections.\n\nPossible Solution:\n\nWebtunnels are a new feature that was introduced only in July of 2025. It allows a webserver to be configured in a way so as to disguise TOR traffic from ISPs. But it also opens up a new possibility, by creating a larger network of Webtunnels, especially by basing these webtunnels in China, Hong Kong, Russia, Belarus, and other countries that have especially low rates of intelligence sharing, we can not only allow a much greater level of bandwidth than we currently get from bridges, but we can also  create a final buffer to protect the end user from deanonimization, as the final 'node' in our system, is now guaranteed to be located in a place that will not allow easy access to nation-state level adversaries. It also has the added bonus of doing what web tunnels are designed to do, which is conceal TOR traffic from the ISP of the end user.\n\nWhat do you all think about this idea? Is there currently a critical flaw in TOR architecture, and can webtunnels provide a solution to this security flaw?\n\nI think this subject is really important to discuss and bring to the attention of all users, so I ask that mods will please sticky this thread so that we can drive useful discussion.

Generally such sites use tor hidden services to anonymize their location, which if implemented correctly are pretty solid.\n\nBut, it only takes one mistake, like having an alternate means of access to the server that is not via a hidden service or a vulnerability of the service itself for smart operators to de-anonymize the server IP & thus its location.\n\nAlso many a dark market has fallen for reasons unrelated to tor entirely, often they fail because their operator was identified or their financial operations were traced.\n\nIn almost all cases such failures are unrelated to any theoretical weakness of the tor protocol or implementation.",

That’s why many criminals have left tor and gone to telegram. Plus we haven’t even spoken about PIB person identifiable behavior. With nation states you have assume you hide something small in plain site for a short amount of time. There is push for steganography but there is most certainly no perfected or preferred way.

There's many built in integrations to make integrating and parsing logs into Elastic from common commercial products easily. It's also a polished tool to use and the built in features are leagues ahead of Wazuh (things like having functionality for easy tuning and rule exceptions, or even the ability to create custom rules in a GUI as opposed to writing raw XML rule files). I've worked extensively with both and Elastic is a much more polished product than Wazuh and easier to work with.\n\n\nAny SIEM will need significant configuration, testing and validation to ensure the alerting picks up what you want it to. E.g you will likely need to write a rule that alerts where X happens followed by Y followed by Z. Or if the native integration for Platform A doesn't have relevant detection rules, you'll need to write a query to trigger an alert where X happens. Any SIEM has quirks but Elastic has excellent documentation and works as described.\n\n\nYou will also need to tune built in rules or disable them if they are not relevant - otherwise it will become noisy. Someone, ideally several people, need to be responsible for maintaining the SIEM. It's not set and forget.",

You need dedicated people to tune it, maintain it, and fix it when Elasticsearch decides to have a bad day. The \"free\" part evaporates real quick when you factor in enginnering hours.\n\nWazuh is similar story. Great tool, but complex. If OP already said its too big and complex, Graylog is gonna feel the same way.\n\nLogZilla is different in that it deploys via Docker in like, seconds, has an app store with pre-built parsers for something like 50 vendors out of the box (so you're not writing regex for every log source), and the alerting already set up with the apps. They also have AI built in so you can literally ask it questions instead of learning yet another query language. I even ingested the \"Epstein\" dataset one weekend just to have fun and it blew my mind. You can see that post here\" [https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1p5xken/comment/nqpppfq/](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1p5xken/comment/nqpppfq/)\n\nIt's not bloated like QRadar or Splunk, which, based on what OP described is actaully a good thing. Sometimes you just need something that works without requiring a team of admins to babysit it and also not costing a fortune",

Off the shelf integrations and if possible - detection sets - will be one of your biggest time savers. Assign the testing phase project to one or two of your best engineers with strict requirement to track their time. \n \nYou will find a SIEM is a bigger time and resource commitment than you think, but in the right environment and with proper investment it will be invaluable to you and your team.",

In what world is it a normal thing that an AI can run an executable it's never seen before, without permissions? \n\nFinally: If you want your coding AI to browse random websites for you before coding...

Are they among the top 50?

And there is currently virtually no AI regulation anywhere in the world, but especially in the US, so that's a purely theoretical one.\n\nThe real risks that are out there are the same as they've been for the past few years.\n\nWeak passwords.

I honestly didn’t expect this much interest about my personal project, and the suggestions and discussions have been really valuable.\n\nI’m taking notes and will use this feedback to improve the project step by step.

Then I spent 8 months trying to get interviews and finally got a dev job at a bank. From there, I discovered and got the Sec+ cert.\n\n\nTimes have changed and coding bootcamps are not a sure ticket to employment. You sound like you're on a good path though-- the certs you mentioned are good. CCNA is worth it, and I would recommend Azure certs if you want to get into GRC and you're looking for your next block of certs. Azure because enterprise orgs with compliance needs are gonna be using Windows machines. \n\n\nRegarding brainpower and capped earnings-- been there! I know the feeling. That was one of my biggest motivators to find something else I liked. I'd say keep going with the certs and also focus on getting job interviews.",

This is my first job in a SOC environment and I had no prior SOC experience before starting.\n\nTo be honest, when I first joined my basics weren’t great. Since then I’ve been putting in a lot of personal time to learn and improve, and I’m still doing that every day.\n\nOne thing I’m trying to wrap my head around is how security tools and log sources are usually laid out inside an organization, and how traffic normally flows between them.\n\nI understand what a lot of log sources do individually (firewalls, EDR, email security, proxies, etc.), but I’m missing the bigger picture. Things like where firewalls are typically placed, how traffic usually moves (for example email gateway → firewall → proxy → endpoint), where forward vs reverse proxies sit, which systems tend to see traffic first and which see it later, and what kind of logs each layer usually generates in real environments.\n\nI don’t want to limit this to just those questions though. If there are other log sources, architectural pieces, or general concepts that you think a new SOC analyst should understand, I’d really appreciate hearing about them. General advice is also very welcome.\n\nThe reason I’m asking is practical. When I open an alert and see it was generated by a specific source, I want to be able to think “okay, this traffic probably passed through X and Y before getting here” and reason about how it actually happened.\n\nI know every organization is different and that I ultimately need to understand my own company’s environment, but I still feel like hearing how things are usually set up in most orgs would help me build a solid baseline.\n\nAny explanations, examples, diagrams, or advice would be really appreciated.

Besides this, you can also get some http/https traffic from reverse proxy or WAF\n\nforward/reverse proxy just depends on what you need.. usually, since reverse just exposes internal service for clients, it sits in DMZ ... forward proxy, in my experience you can often just have NGFW with PAT.\n\nNowadays, you also usually get some azure ad (entra) logs, which you need to ingest (unless you use sentinel) .. and traffic would be just internal -> egress to internet -> your azure tenant in MS. \n\n \n\nI guess best way to learn would actually be to ask your network team if you could have a peak at their diagrams, at least the high level overview. If you are MSSP..good luck. Besides that, you can google some network security architecture for X, this should get you diagrams so you can picture how stuff can be at least.\n\n  \nI agree with MailNinja, if you are getting EDR alerts or notice something malicious on an endpoint thats immediate high risk and needs attention, since it had to traverse the network from internet and is sitting on the endpoint. If you see some FW/WAF alerts, that can be some scanning etc. which can be nothing or someone looking for a way in",

You learn what each tool does on its own, but nobody really explains how they fit together in real environments.  \nWhat helped me most was realizing there isn’t one clean flow. Most orgs are messy and layered over time. Tools exist because of past incidents or audits, not because someone designed a perfect diagram. Roughly, think in layers instead of a straight line. Perimeter firewall / gateways see north-south traffic. User traffic often looks like endpoint → proxy → firewall → internet, but sometimes the proxy *is* the firewall, or it’s agent-based and skips network gear entirely. Email is its own path and usually hits multiple tools before the endpoint ever sees it.\n\nEndpoints are where things become “real” for the SOC. EDR alerts are usually late in the chain but high signal. Network and email logs are earlier and noisier, but they tell you how something got there. The mental model that helped me most was asking: *if this alert is real, what had to happen before it?* Follow one alert all the way back a few times and the architecture starts to make sense.  \nFeeling lost a month in is normal. If you’re already thinking about traffic paths and log relationships, you’re doing fine.",

My CISO is largely disengaged, so strategy, execution, incident ownership, board prep, tooling decisions, and team direction all fall on me. I’m working long hours and carrying the accountability, but without the CISO title or compensation.\n\nThere are positives: I have significant autonomy, real influence over the department’s future, and the ability to shape the company’s security posture with minimal interference. From a growth and experience standpoint, it’s been valuable.\n\nThe negatives are harder to ignore. When something goes wrong, the responsibility lands on me. There’s no corresponding pay, title, or formal authority, and the workload is well beyond what my role is supposed to be. Overtime is constant, and the risk exposure feels asymmetrical.\n\nI’m trying to assess whether this is a strategic career opportunity I should continue leveraging, or a situation where I’m being unintentionally (or intentionally) taken advantage of.

If your CISO is \"hands-off\" then either you or the CISO is superfluous (sounds like the CISO)\n\nAs is, CISOs are often misplaced (despite the title, rarely are they corporate officers) and often have strange reporting lines to other \"chiefs\" (COOs, CFOs, CIOs). What a lot of that points to is that for boards, the easy thing to do is create a job title, but it takes some thought and knowledge to create a sensible org chart. The end result is we end up with all these figurehead tech/security \"chiefs\" but the real work gets done a layer or two beneath them.\n\nThis also speaks to how security has become its own silo over the years. There was a time when even very large organizations did not have dedicated security professionals. It was just all IT. Then, in the 1990s, you had CitiCorp respond to being hacked by naming a CISO, and suddenly everyone else felt they needed to do the same (again, the job title is easy, the job description and context is not). While this works in some environments, in many, it has fractured security away from IT to the point where it is almost satirical. As this dysfunction moves down the corporate ladder, it induces frustration and burnout. And so the board response is to just throw more management at the problem (again, more chiefs).",

The role generally exists to have more control and ownership over the tactical operations of the security team -- leading day-to-day operations and making sure that projects are completed. The reporting aspects come with that territory.\n\nWhat the CISO should be doing is upwards and outwards communication. Working with other C-Suite folks, handling the politics at that higher level, and working on things like contract negotiations with customers or even doing sales sessions. Other people mention speaking engagements and that's also part of the deal.\n\nThe one thing that I'd say sounds like is mis-placed is strategy. If the CISO really isn't even directing strategy and providing guidance on how to build the team, then I think they might be either overwhelmed at the moment or actually checked out (to your point).\n\nMy next steps for you would be to take stock of what services, projects, and tasks you have on your plate that you and your team are doing, focusing specifically on things that require a lot of your attention. You likely shouldn't be doing any of those -- your staff should be handling and distributing that stress for you. Make sure to document ownership of those items within your organization and hold your team accountable for making it happen. Then one of two things will happen: either you will feel less stressed and things will run smoother, or things will fall apart and you might need to re-think your skillset and headcount within the team (and THAT conversation is one to have with the CISO).\n\nJust as an FYI, the job market SUCKS right now. Especially at our level, there are tons of people competing for a very scarce number of open seats. I've been in-seat at my current position about four months now, and it honestly took a full year (six months passively applying and looking, six months actively applying and interviewing) to land the new gig. And that's with previous CISO experience on the resume. If you are really fed up and want to move, I'd recommend to start casually applying to open roles as you see them come across your feed.

I would look for other opportunities personally, then if your company wants to keep you, make sure they know what your limits are. \n\n> Is your CISO hands off?\n\nMine is very technical, which I find to be rare.  Former operator for a 3 letter agency, and really knows his stuff.  One of those where when he’s asking a question, he knows the answer, but is testing you.  Very disliked by the organization because he actually knows how APTs operate and wasn’t interested in box checking compliance or if a scan says it’s secure.  I liked him because of that.   There’s no question our systems were more secure because he’s pushing back on the bean counters wanting the bare minimum.",

This is also why people are paranoid of supply chain issues (like SolarWinds a few years ago). These won't show on any offline scan of a drive (because they aren't on a drive).\n\nIn the more \"firm\" days of firmware, the place to hide malware was the master boot record. This is the code loaded before your OS. This is why a full reformat of your hard drive is/was a necessary step for recovering from an infection.\n\nThen as your OS loads, you can have malware pretend to be some system file. While easier to detect, the malware can detect and interfere with the launching of \"anti-virus\" software and the like. This is why a clean install is necessary.\n\nUsually what occurs is you encounter a series of malware. Something exploits a vulnerability and pulls down more code that grants higher privilege (e.g. access to the OS, MBR, or even firmware), which in turn installs some persistent compromise in a place that evades detection.",

      "text": "As title states, what is the false positive rate in your SOC?\n\nI ask this because I need a sanity check from the community. I'm experiencing severe burnout in my SOC role. I am a one man SOC. In the past four months, I've single-handedly resolved over 7,000 alerts.\n\nOur false positive rate exceeds 99.99%. Despite repeated tuning requests, the detection engineer deflects them, citing reasons why rules can't be refined. Detections are overly generic, leading to excessive noise, and they do not map accurately to MITRE ATT&CK framework.\n\nNew detections are deployed to production without notifying or briefing analysts. There is none of the following: \n\nKnowledge base defining true vs. false positives\n\nClear goals for each detection\n\nDetailed alert descriptions\n\nPlaybooks for investigation\n\nAs a result, I spend hours researching each new alert type and writing my own playbooks before triage.\n\nTo address these shortcomings, I proposed:\n\nImplementing an Alert Detection Strategy (ADS) framework\n\nCreating a detection catalog\n\nBuilding a reference knowledge base\n\nI even drafted internal documentation and a guide for engineers to complete the ADS framework for each detection. The engineer rejected it as \"too time and resource intensive.\"\n\nWhen I asked about the goal of weekly new detections, the engineer became upset, told me that \"a good analyst just knows,\" and escalated to politics. This led to mandatory redundant data entry across multiple ticket fields (who, what, when, where, and why are already present in my analysis) which has doubled ticket resolution times, increasing eye strain, and worsening my burnout. I have been vocal about my burnout, and I have been gaslit by the engineer that my burnout is not because of mandatory field filling or high ticket number but because I'm an incompetent analyst.\n\nManagement sides with the engineer. It's clear there's no interest in improving SOC efficiency.\n\nI'm trying to get an idea of what the false positive rate is in different SOCs for my own sanity.\n\nI have included the details to make newcomers to SOC aware of what goes on in a dysfunctional SOC.",

How many analysts do you have on your team for 150 clients?   \n  \nI have worked for a few MSSPs and their reporting to client is mainly over how many alerts triggered in clients environment. Basically showing clients how much \"work\" is done even though those alerts do not add any value for the most part. \n\nI have recently implemented a tuning process but there are too many artificial road blocks so I will be quiet quitting this week. I'll keep collecting the paycheck and do the bare minimum from this week. I have been proposing solutions every two weeks in my one-on-one with the manager because he asks me about it but none of those solutions have been implemented. I do not see any reason to continue proposing new solutions since they keep falling on deaf ears. I just cannot let my work ruin my peace anymore.",

                  "text": "I think it's about 12-14 L1 analysts (total, not on shift at once). 3 L2s, 3 L3s. Usually 3 L1 analysts manning the queues during busy periods (shift rotation, some overlapping timezones, just 2 analysts on overnight). Then we have 2 business hours L1s to support (other duties but also jump on alerts when it's busy, which is more often than not). L2s and L3s also do business hours with an on call rotation for escalations. We're aiming for less than 600 alerts total per day as 'normal', with a busy and bad day beeing 750 and 900 ish respectively.  When you break down the alerts per analyst per shift ratio it's still a huge volume for the team. I've (thankfully) been off work for a few weeks so my numbers might be off, but it's basically 1 alert per 20 minutes per analyst is the target. It's kinda fucked still. Not a lot of time to do high quality analysis, although our people still manage to do some amazing work. Testament to their own personal resilience and skills I think.\n\n\nIt's a solid team with good processes and procedures. But analyst burnout and alert fatigue is common, alert fatigue is common. We're in a position where if an analyst calls in sick we are immediately fucked. There isn't much operational resilience.\n\n\nWe could use a few more analysts and 2 more detection engineers to really level up and make things more mature, but there isn't much investment into the SOC despite it being a critical part of the businesses revenue.\n\n\nQuiet quitting kind of sucks because it's as demoralising as it is liberating, but I've also been there before. One thing I've gradually realised is it's not my role to make up for the shortcomings of management or the business as a whole. I can only do my best and what's reasonable within my 8.5 hr day. I want to improve things but sometimes I'm not supported in my role to do that. As much as I want to work on what I find interesting and believe would be most impactful for improving the quality of the work we do, I have to focus on what the business needs due to poor resourcing. Zzzzzz.\n\n\nIt's hard to communicate to people who don't understand or haven't been boots on the ground in a busy SOC, just how bad excessive alerts are. Alert fatigue is real and people will miss TPs in the noise. Clients will ask why things were missed and those questions are hard to answer . More mature clients also understand that a high volume of FPs is bad. You can't be expected to perform good analysis when you are swamped with alerts.\n\n\nFor us unfortunately it took a lot of analysts quitting/leaving (over 6 people in as many months) citing burnout , fatigue and poor management for things to really turn around. We still have a shit load of work to do but it's now more of a 'standard shitshow MSSP' rather than 'totally fucked hostile to staff MSSP'.\n\n\nCould you ask your manager for permission to put in rule exceptions yourself for some of the rules? If they need to now, you could come with a shortlist of top 10 worst alerts, explanation of why it's a FP/B-TP, and high level solutions (they don't need details, just 'tune out normal system activity'). If your DE is useless, you should advocate for the ability to improve detection fidelity yourself. Not only that, you'll learn more about DE yourself, rule logic, writing exceptions in query languages, etc. I find it a lot more fun and engaging than analysing alerts.",

Rules need to be high fidelity if they are going to turn into tickets. If it’s not high fidelity (which is fine) then it needs to be an informational as a supporting signal.

It was still a hard requirement and was still followed. \n\nLarge insurance, benefits, and banks most certainly DO NOT require data to be emailed. Like others, I would suggest doing a risk assessment. You could also include 3rd party security assessments of your vendors as well (depending on contract structure and policies).\n\nIF there is a case where you must use a particular vendor, then you need to get some form of risk acceptance written and documented from senior leadership that acknowledges the risk.

      "text": "I'm trying to get a better idea on what is the average analysts are getting paid at MSSPs. \n\nIn my current role at an MSSP, there’s been continued client growth, and it sometimes feels like team capacity hasn’t fully kept pace, which can make day-to-day SOC work more demanding.\n\nRecruiting experienced analysts has been challenging, as many potential candidates come with requirements that add complexity to the hiring process.\n\nWithout hiring any new analysts our workload has tripled over the last couple of months, and despite promises of raising the entire teams wages nothing has been done. Our whole soc is on the verge of complete burnout. \n\nOur SOC operates within a structure where larger decisions and approvals sit at a higher organizational level. While SOC leadership has advocated for things like compensation adjustments, progress on those fronts has been limited so far.\n\nRight now our wages vary but it's roughly\n\n* Jr. - $70k\n* Mid - $85-$90k\n* Senior - $100-$115k\n\nOur team is made up of roughly 16 analysts supporting over 350 clients, with only two senior analysts. We are consistently overwhelmed with alert volume, while also being expected to tune detection's for clients who have not been fully onboarded. At the same time, we are held to strict SLA and SLO expectations.\n\nThis year we've lost several analysts all leaving for significant bump in wages. \n\nThe sales team has added more people this year and continues to bring in new clients at a steady pace. These new clients are often handed off to the SOC with little context or preparation, which puts immediate pressure on the team. Over the past two years, the focus of the MSSP has gradually shifted toward sales growth rather than security work.\n\nThe job isn't all bad, the amount of experience I'm gaining here is invaluable. But I thought working at a MSSP I would be able to grow faster and make more money. \n\nCurious if others are seeing something similar, or if this tends to be a common challenge for MSSPs when it comes to putting resources back into the SOC.",

The SOC is the backbone of the business but there's been almost no investment into new roles that would greatly relieve burden across the team and deliver more value to clients. Lots of investment into sales team, little to no new roles for the SOC. Analyst burnout is common, most people leave when they get a better job elsewhere.\n\n\nI'd be interested to know from people perhaps higher up at MSSPs why this is the case. I guess you need more sales to fund everything else, but it's been client after client getting added without any meaningful improvements.\n\n\nPart of me thinks it's because SOCs usually just put up with it, staff turnover is accepted, and investment into the SOC isn't abundantly clearly linked to more profit. The quality of triage and alerting is accepted by low maturity clients so they're generally content, no need to 'do anything' to improve the team.",

          "text": "Detection and response is always going to be difficult -- if you can detect malicious activity you should be able to prevent it, and if you can't prevent it there is a good chance it's because you can't detect it. There are a small handful of ambiguous cases where detection and investigation and response can work...but even then the attacker is usually already on to bigger and better things by the time someone investigates the alert, concludes it is indeed malicious, and gets approval/works up the nerve to do something about it.\n\nThe best org I've ever seen in my career so far focused on creating very specific and enforced standards of user behavior and then, once those standards were established, they could be super hardcore about going after deviations. For example, they used CA to ensure that even valid creds were only granted access if they came from a domain joined machine loaded up with a formidable stack of endpoint controls, and only after successful 2FA. \n\nAlso, the security team had highly aggressive alerting and automated response on users logging in from multiple workstations or even from different workstations than normal. They would automatically quarantine any mismatched user / machine combo and freeze access pending a conversation with the user. Most cases were a person triggering it by accident, but it and policy required that users could only get work done if they logged into their own workstation with their user.\n\nThey also blocked by default all logins outside of business hours / days (besides certain IT users, of course, or those who had an approved off-hours login request).\n\nThis meant that attackers couldn't get anywhere even with valid creds. They needed creds *and* 2FA *and* a shell on the user's specific (and formidably protected) workstation *and* needed to do everything during normal work hours and days. And because the way the org structured work made it easy for legit users to do all this without issue (while still being quite flexible in terms of remote work), they could be extremely aggressive about quarantining, locking, and otherwise auto blocking any deviations by default. \n\nSo the second an attacker messed up, they would immediately lose that access. And because the alerting was all very high confidence, it became very fast and easy for the security team to identify source IPs and other correlating indicators to quickly find additional compromised accounts once the first one got busted and shut them down as well.\n\nI did a lot of pentesting in this environment, and it was a *massive pain in the ass* to operate in as an attacker, so it was definitely effective. And it definitely took a lot of upfront effort and planning for the defenders to set up...but once the norms of behavior were in place it was quite easy for security and users to operate without many issues going forward, and for them to expand the network in a secure and careful fashion (because they were starting from a controlled position, rather then scrambling to keep up).\n\nI think the key with doing behavior based detections and controls is you have to also establish pretty specific and rigid standards of behavior. A lot of orgs imagine they can do behavioral detections while also doing BYOD, logins at any time and from anywhere, and so on, and assume that AI can figure it all out...but then either get annoyed when their normal activity keeps getting flagged and investigated or get surprised when an attacker waltzes in without issue because people stopped investigating anomalous login alerts because of alert fatigue (or because there are so many that, by the time they investigate the true positive, the attacker has already done whatever they came there to do and either moved on or pivoted far enough away that the initial access alert is essentially meaningless).",

I'm talking about the hacker mindset in the old meaning of the word.  Then again, HR was a pain in the back. The only reason I started piling on certs is to bypass them. They all want to hire someone capable of \"thinking outside the box\", yet they apply the same hiring mould... I don't even want to think about how it's now with all the AI crap.\n\nI started focusing on switching mid 2020 during the first lockdown and switched careers in 2021, in my late 30s, from outside IT, and now I am a security engineer, part of an 8 man team that manages about 200 firewalls for a large corp. I was hired directly as a systems engineer, and then after 6 months, another company hired me as a security engineer. Then, 1 year after, for an even better job at the company I'm still working at.\n\nI always tinkered with computers, since before Windows 95. I remember bypassing the BIOS password when I was 7-8 years old (589589 or 655655 anyone? : ) ). My home setup could practically act as the infrastructure for a small company. Right now, I have about 15-20 IT certs (had about 5-7 at the time of the first job).  I feel it was all about luck.\n\nThe first job in 2021 (when everyone was changing jobs) was after the actual owner of a small company interviewed me, and liked my passion for toying with stuff. That was like the 20th interview out of god knows how many applications. That was a systems engineer job, and to be honest, I applied by mistake. I didn't read the ad properly, else I wouldn't have applied because I wouldn't have thought I had a chance of even getting an interview. The second job (the first security engineer) was after applying for a NOC position for a large VAR/CSP. The guy was impressed, and since at the time (although not advertised), they were hiring a security engineer, he asked me if I wanted to interview with the manager for the other job (the second interview was mostly formal)\n\nGood luck.",

I hope someone will correct my misapprehensions.\n\nFirst of all, good for you doing that. SELinux is a dark art that's been layered under by a lack of support for bundled tools most people use and more generic security technologies that box in processes to prevent errant software from jailbreaking out from a service into the wider operating system or network. \n\nMost analysts don't have the opportunity to work with SELinux configurations. The usual pattern is that someone in development will override the security defaults to get software working, and security only finds out about it after the fact, and attempts to fix it. That then becomes a political tug-of-war.\n\nThis is why secure operating systems these days are pushing Flatpak and other sandboxed security solutions. Security by abstraction, making the security of solutions a discrete software layer vs. using configuration hardening, is the panacea of today.",

Grades wise im doing really good so far.\n\nThis 4 years of uni are the first time I have ever done computer science and have learned quite a bit while in uni.\n\nAfter finishing uni, my plan was to find a job relating to IT (it technician, it helpservice desk etc.) for a few years while doing certifications (comptia etc.) And then loo for a job relating to my field ( aim to be networking admin/engineer)\n\nHowever, I am yet to find a job and am getting a little worried about the future even further now. \n\nI have done an IT internship for a month and have done some courses on udemy and cs50 courses to help boost my cv but still am unable to land some jobs. \n\nMy family and friends are trying to push me into doing a masters byt I feel like im just wasting money not to mention just delaying un employment. And also im quite burnt out from studying tbh.\n\nAm getting very worried about future prospects and feel like I haven't achieved alot and am feeling more of a failure. \n\nAm i screwed? And if so, what could I possibly do to improve my chances of getting my foot into the metaphorical doorstep?\n",

You think you know the answer, but a tiny twist in wording can totally change what they're asking.  \nI've noticed myself falling into a few patterns: assuming the first plausible answer is correct, skipping details in cloud security scenarios, or treating questions more like a memory quiz instead of actually thinking them through.  \nAnd yeah… procrastination, the holidays, all of it just piled up, ugh  \nWhat were your \"trap\" moments while prepping for CCSP?

          "text": "Always on exame I apply two rules. \n\nFirst, these types of exams always have similar structure: 1 awfully wrong answer, 1 wrong answer, and two kind-of correct answers. You always need to select the one that fits best to the scenario given, or if there's no enough context, to the more generalistic scenario. Never, ever, assume things. After I jump into the answers, I start by identifying the wrong ones. That gives me additional focus on analyzing the wording of the good ones.\n\nSecond, studying. Unfortunately, there's many answers that are vendor-related. What I mean is: there's answers that could not necessarily make 100% sense, but that's how that specific vendor teach it. So the answer should be focused on that vendor. I have found some discrepancies on terminology between different vendors.\n\nThird (I know, I said 2): if you don't know the concept, try to take a guess making sense with the answers. If even with that you don't know what the f##k is being talked about... skip it. You may come back later to check if your brain remembered something, or just select a random answer. Just don't lose a lot of time in a question. \n\nOut of those rules... the rest is pure experience or knowledge.",

Simplifying this as \"laziness\" is, at the very least, intellectual dishonesty.\n\nYour argument reduces a complex structural problem to \"try harder,\" which is laughable. The criticism here is about the monetization of hope and the technical irrelevance of many required certifications, not about work ethic.

          "text": "> I don't have any interest\n\nThen this field is going to be really hard for you. There is bifurcation in the job market these days. If you learned most of what you know from a book or a degree program or certifications, it's a pretty weak market and probably will be for the medium-term future. There is still strong demand for the self-taught hackers whose curiosity and persistence and cheeky approach to rules leads them to produce interesting outcomes.\n\nAI and security are inextricably linked. In part, that's because security tool vendors seem very intent on shoving AI into all their products, and in part because every other use of AI needs security and governance guardrails. If you're getting into the security field in 2025, you're also getting into the AI field. That will be a growth area and I suspect we'll see some pretty public security failures along the way to motivate companies. But it's also an area with a lot of bullshitters and trend chasers and it'll take the job market a little while to sort out who is contributing real value. It's wise to expect some turbulence along the way.\n\nMy tl;dr answer is go into the field if you love it. If you've already spent your youth hacking your environment and the technology and the societal rules around you, you'll find a good path. If you're just looking for a profession to learn to pay the bills, consider dentistry.",
