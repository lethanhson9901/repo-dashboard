To reduce the risk, \"we should look WIPS, NAC, etc and the rough estimate is $XXX\". They could have mentioned \"we can do it here, at Z we are going to run into compliance issues, and at Y we will not be able to do it due to known RF interference issues\". \n\nThey could have done all sorts of things but the OP gave the impression that they only said that the CEO is an idiot.

I don't really have a say on what we're paying them, however, it feels like we're paying a ton for resources that don't really fit our needs.\n\nHere's my experience so far: I explain my need, I'm given a few options, and then I'm \"forced\" to choose one of them and I am essentially being told that my feedback on why they wouldn't work for my team is \"wrong.\" This leaves me with a team of fresh grads with zero technical context to run the engagement. We’re stuck redoing half of their reports because they lack the hands on experience in our domain to understand our actual stack. I have received great resources from them in the past, but the quality drop has been insane over the last few months or so.\n\nIs anyone here been in a similar position as me?

The client had each of the Big 4 doing work for them in one part of their business. Each had an army and after 2 years, none of them had delivered on anything. So the client asked us to get involved. The Big 4 promptly got booted out and we were given the work. We ultimately scrapped everything (cheaper than figuring out how to salvage anything) and we got it all done in about 4 months. Afterwards we were at the corporate office and I joked with senior leadership that we offer cybersecurity janitorial services (we clean up others' messes). They chuckled and then complained about the rates we charged. I just asked them how much did they pay the Big 4 for 2 years with zero projects completed. I followed it up with they should just pay us to do the work going forward as it will be done on-time, on-budget, and done right. (Ah, the joys of youth). That was 13 years ago and the client still puts a significant amount of money in our pocket every single year. There is a significant amount of hard earned trust and respect between us. \n\nTLDR: Our rates may be a bit higher but we deliver.\n\nI do recommend considering boutique firms as you can get exceptional service and a quality product for usually a relatively competitive rate.",

They acqui-hired local specialists through the boom period, and anyone senior quit to go do the same thing, for better clients/engagements and more money either solo or for boutique’s.\n\nAI then made its way into every level of consulting at Big 4 and now even their audit function is cancerous, we’re just waiting for the eventual radiation to start once they’re found out. It’s happened to a few regional offices, who’ve completely gutted the function and lost hundreds of millions of contracts,m..\n\n.. But yeah, long story short; the big boys got hooked on cheap revenue through title inflation for juniors, created a culture of misrepresentation, which is now being propped up and accelerated by slop.\n\nBoutique, regional and independents are the only way to go now. If your partner is owned by private equity or big 4; run.\n\nMy only recommendation is to ask those in the field near you who they’d hire, and then go with the firm who’s over represented by SME’s in the field you’re hiring.

I work mostly in offensive security, penetration testing, etc. and almost all of the ones I've encountered are woefully sub-par when it comes to technical ability. \n\nThere are of course great people there, but given how many consultants they have it's unsurprising that the average is pretty low.  \n\nI own a offensive security company - and have worked in the industry for \\~20 years, and am from a very technical background (and still even do testing/VR), so feel that I have the ability to judge this pretty well. \n\nHaving said all that, almost all of the people I've met from big4 are very good consultants in general and while technically perhaps aren't super awesome, they really do blend a lot of parts into the package to be just that, consultants. From my friends who have worked at the big consultancy firms, I'm not surprised that all this seems to be the case as their job requirements also often involve soft-selling and other non-technical requirements too.\n\nTake everything I've said with a pinch of salt because I personally haven't worked at a big4.\n\nMy overall recommendation is to go with small-mid sized companies. Independent contractors - especially for penetration testing - are likely not a good idea. Pentesters will often use contractors/associates to do their work and naturally go through a selection process to ensure the standard is up to scratch and that reports/work is QA'd and meeting a particular standard too.\n\nMy general sense is that small-independent companies that have a good reputation are the best companies to go with - ideally before they've been bought out by bigger companies.\n\nAnother thing to note is that smaller/mid-sized companies are often very much more focused on establishing and keeping a good relationship with their clients - big4 can really take or leave any contracts that are not hitting the millions pretty easily and not sweat it too badly.\n\nI don't know if you're specifically talking about pentesting/offensive security stuff - but I guess my experience in this particular area is replicated across others too.\n\nHope this helps.",

They start as associates which do the vast majority of the work, supposedly under the direction of senior associates and managers.  The partners manage the client.  The associates are thrown under the bus and told to go support this client the day they start.  At another company, I worked with someone who had spent years with a Big 4.  He said the second day he was there he was told to fly to a client and one of the other people there would help him learn what he needed to do.\n\nThis model chews through associates at a very high rate of turnover, at most a couple of years.  Then they leave for places with less pressure and just an overall better culture.  \n\nThe ones that stay tend to have the goal of making partner as fast as they can, though a few choose to go down the senior non-partner path for things like director positions.

That is 100% malicious.\n\nTo answer your specific questions: yes, the ~800MB size is actually a massive IOC in itself.\n\nWhat you're seeing is called \"Binary Padding\" or \"File Pumping.\" Malware authors intentionally stuff the binary with hundreds of megabytes of junk data (usually just zeroes) to inflate the file size. They do this because almost all AV/EDR solutions (including Sophos) have a file-size limit for scanning to prevent CPU bottlenecks. If a file is over 500MB, the scanner often just skips it. That’s likely how it got past the initial defense.\n\nregarding the lock/hashing issue:\n\nThe interactions with hmpalert.dll (HitmanPro Alert, which is part of Sophos) suggest Sophos knows it's suspicious but is stuck in a weird state.\n\n• The EDR likely hooked the file or holds a kernel-level handle on it (which is why you can't calculate the hash or check ownership—it's locked by a driver).\n\n• It's basically a standoff: Sophos has it pinned but might be failing to quarantine it because of that massive file size.\n\nHow to unblock yourself:\nSince the OS won't let you touch the file to get a hash:\n\n1. The \"Easy\" Way: Boot into Safe Mode (Networking Disabled). This usually stops the malware and unloads the Sophos drivers locking the file. You should be able to hash or copy it then.\n\n2. The \"Live\" Way: Use a tool that leverages Volume Shadow Copies (like Hobocopy or RawCopy). This lets you copy the file from the shadow volume, bypassing the file lock entirely.\n\nOnce you get that hash, I guarantee it’s going to be a known baddie (or a heavily padded variant of one). Good catch on the \"svhost\" typo!",

Is a DBA in IT?  Yes.  Is the VoIP administrator in IT?  Yes.  Do they have much overlap?  No.  They intersect, but don't overlap very much.  The same goes for pen tester, malware engineer, incident responder, and digital forensics engineer.  IT and cybersecurity are incredibly wide fields, and certifications help distinguish a person's experience and skill set in slices of those huge spaces.  Even to the point of this vendor or that one.  An administrator may be responsible for a system that serves thousands of users, and the product has hundreds of developers that have been developing it for 10 years.  It is a huge thing, and something one could build a career around.  A lot of people would have the experience, knowledge, and aptitude to learn to manage it, but someone with a certificate from that vendor, or in that specific role, has evidence that they HAVE learned it, and can be productive very quickly in the role.",

          "text": "I’m not saying certifications are useless. They aren’t. But early in a career, they are often oversold, especially when compared to the long-term value of a solid four-year degree.\n\nI’m a director and manager of a small but highly capable DFIR cyber team that operates as part of a larger cyber organization. I’m directly involved in hiring, mentoring, and developing analysts. What I’m seeing today is very different from what the market looked like even three to five years ago.\n\nThere was a gold rush in cybersecurity. Organizations needed people quickly, and they needed them “good enough” to staff SOCs and respond to alerts. Bootcamps and entry-level certifications filled a real need at the time. They helped people get up to speed on basic tooling and workflows, and for a while that was enough to get hired.\n\nThat phase is over.\n\nThe market has matured. Much of the truly entry-level work has either been offshored, automated, or absorbed by better tooling, better processes, and more efficient teams. What remains are higher-expectation roles that require deeper understanding, better judgment, and the ability to adapt when things do not follow a playbook.\n\nDegrees matter again. Experience matters more. The bar is higher.\n\nWhat I still see, especially on Reddit and similar forums, is people clinging to the gold-rush mentality: get a few certs, land a SOC I role, and get catapulted into a cybersecurity career. That pathway is far less reliable today, and for many people it simply doesn’t work anymore.\n\nCertifications absolutely have a place, but they are not a replacement for a strong foundational education.\n\nA good four-year degree in computer science, computer information systems, or a well-designed cybersecurity program builds something certifications cannot: depth, context, and adaptability. When my team is hiring, I generally prefer candidates with CS or CIS degrees over narrowly focused cyber degrees. Those candidates consistently demonstrate broader technical understanding and stronger problem-solving skills.\n\nCS and CIS graduates tend to understand how systems actually work, not just how to operate tools. They are more comfortable with ambiguity. They reason better when something breaks in a way they haven’t seen before. They can pivot when a tool fails, logs don’t line up, or an incident doesn’t match a textbook scenario.\n\nThat matters in DFIR. It matters in mature cyber environments.\n\nI can teach the cybersecurity specifics, our workflows, our tools, our processes, relatively quickly if the person already has a solid technical foundation. I cannot easily teach systems thinking, troubleshooting intuition, or years of exposure to operating systems, networking, programming concepts, and data structures if those fundamentals were skipped.\n\nThis is where certifications fit best: continuing education.\n\nCerts are excellent for learning specific tools, platforms, or methodologies. They are valuable when someone already understands the underlying technology and has real-world experience to anchor that knowledge. Used that way, they are powerful. Used as a substitute for foundational education, they are fragile.\n\nHome labs, YouTube videos, and self-study are all useful, but they are not the same as being accountable in a real environment, working real incidents, under real constraints, with real consequences. A four-year degree, especially an in-person program done well, exposes students to that rigor over time and forces them to build habits that matter later in their careers.\n\nFaster is not always better.\n\nIf someone is early in their career and serious about cybersecurity as a long-term profession, not just landing their first job, the strongest path is still a solid four-year technical degree, followed by experience, and then certifications layered on top. That combination produces professionals who can grow, adapt, and remain relevant long after the latest tool or cert falls out of favor.\n\nThat’s what mature cyber teams are looking for now.",

I’m sure they had others, but the key point I think was that they were hiring a bunch of people at once, instead of adding a person to an existing team. Even the managers and their supervisors were coming in all at the same time, so politics/routines/preferences weren’t set in stone yet.\n\nThis is why I think that was important: while I have a *ton* of experience all across the board, I got hired *despite* these facts:\n\n    I hadn’t been getting paid at my prior job (I was basically just break even)\n    I’m pretty sure (based on more than one odd comment) I instantly failed a background check, because I owed student loans. \n    I had no certifications.\n    I needed relocation assistance\n    I was applying for an entry-level position with almost ridiculous proof that I have more experience (so…why?)\n    I omitted all programming/development experience on my resume.\n    Unusual education (and no bachelor’s)\n\nNone of that is mentioned to make you feel discouraged—like “wow, if I got hired with these problems…” …no: If I had applied to an established SOC I’m sure several of those would’ve gotten me hard-pass with prejudice, but they took a chance on me, and I literally got to see a major cost-is-no-object SOC get built from scratch.\n\nMy point is, and I really hope it’s a logical one—because there are many seasoned / career security folks here (I’m a career jack of all trades)—if you’re applying to established SOCs, perhaps you can get an angle on someone building a *new* one. I’m just one data point, but for the life of me “not yet established” is the best reason I can think of for why this risky proposition was hired.\n\n*(While there are probably some things that worked in my favor, they are probably typical and expected of anyone)*",

The most important skills to focus on are SIEM engineering, scripting, cloud security basics, detection engineering, and infrastructure knowledge. This usually takes 1-2 years.",

Recruiters often see \"SOC\" on a resume and their brain just autopilots to \"ticket closer\" rather than \"engineer.\"\n\nThe reality is that to make the jump, you have to fundamentally change your narrative from \"I monitor the tools\" to \"I build the tools.\"\n\nIf you want to break out, here is the specific stuff you need to start doing so you can slap \"Security Engineer\" on your resume without feeling like an imposter:\n\n1. Stop clicking, start coding\nThis is the biggest filter. You don't need to be a full-stack dev, but you need to be comfortable with Python. If you find yourself doing a task in the SOC more than twice (like checking an IP against VirusTotal), write a script to do it for you. Put that script on GitHub. That is now \"Security Tooling Development,\" not just analysis.\n\n2. Learn how the sausage is made (Infrastructure)\nEngineers need to know how the servers and logs actually get built. Pick up Terraform or Ansible. Learn how to deploy a cloud instance (AWS or Azure) using code rather than the web console. If you can explain how the logs get to the SIEM, you’re already ahead of 90% of analysts.\n\n3. The \"Detection Engineering\" Bridge\nThis is the easiest pivot. Instead of just triaging the alert, start writing the logic that creates the alert. Look into Sigma rules. If you can tell an interviewer, \"I don't just work tickets, I write the custom detection logic using Sigma and deploy it via a CI/CD pipeline,\" you are hired.\n\nYou got this. Just start building.",

Identity and access management, especially Active Directory and Entra ID, is a big one. Most breaches involve credential abuse, privilege escalation, or misconfigurations that have existed for years. People who truly understand identity, permissions, service accounts, and privilege boundaries tend to be extremely valuable in enterprise environments because those systems are everywhere and deeply trusted.\n\nAnother underrated area is internal exposure and security operations. Over-permissioned file shares, weak auditing, poor change visibility, and fragile backup or hardening practices cause far more damage than most zero-days. These topics are less visible online because they are messy and environment-specific, but mastering them makes you effective in the real world and hard to replace.",

          "text": "It is possible to get a somewhat 9-5 shift hour sort of SOC analyst job. \n\n1) Major MNCs utilising GSOC across the globe \n\nMajor MNCs with global presence tend to adopt a follow-the-sun strategy for their GSOC (global SOC). For this, they are likely to have 3 SOC teams at\n- GMT +8 (HK, SG time)\n- GMT +0 (UK time)\n- GMT -8 (US West Coast)\n\nSo each team works somewhat office hours and hand over to the next team as they end their work day. \n\nHowever, some GSOCs might also choose to operate 10-12 hours even if they do follow-the-sun. In such case, the team still takes the lead in managing the GSOC during their scheduled time. But the come in 1-2 hours early and stay 1-2 hours after the official shift for their team so that they can have meetings and do various tool development projects during those time. \n\nHowever, they still need people to work on weekends. Hence, it’s still some sort of “shift”. \n\nSo with the weekends and the 10-12 hour shifts model, some of these teams do a 4-days-on-3-days-off rotation format to even things out. \n\n2) Tier-2 SOC Analyst with MSSP supporting \n\nIn the somewhat-have-sufficient-money-but-not-too-much-money tier kind of companies… sometimes they engage MSSP to support as Tier-1 analysts. The MSSP will fulfil the role of 24 hours monitoring of alerts and carry out the initial triages. \n\nThen, when the MSSP discovers a likely-true-positive, they would forward it to the company’s tier 2 SOC analyst for investigation to confirm if IR is needed. \n\nAs the true positives are far and less… you don’t need these Tier-2 SOC Analyst to be on 24-hour shifts. But they are usually expected to be on “standby” somewhat and respond when needed (including in the wee hours). There will be a SLA (service level agreement) with regards to the expected response time. So if you are on “standby” on Xmas night… you can still spend time with your family and enjoy Christmas dinner… but you better not get drunk and should have your laptop with you at all times.",
