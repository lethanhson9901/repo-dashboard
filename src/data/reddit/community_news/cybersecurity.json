In managed Windows estates, recovery keys are escrowed to Active Directory or Entra ID for operational resilience, device replacement, and incident response. When keys live there, they are accessible through administrative workflows and, in some cases, lawful process. That isn't a BitLocker backdoor. It's the outcome of how key custody is designed.\n\nThe real question is not whether BitLocker is broken.\n\nIt is who controls recovery key access, under what authority, and with what oversight. \n\nIf an organization centralizes recovery keys, then identity security (the permission to access these keys) becomes part of the encryption boundary. Privileged access controls, role separation, approval workflows, and auditing determine whether those keys are protected or casually exposed.",

The app was blocked for other DHS employees at the time.\n\n>None of the files Gottumukkala plugged into ChatGPT were classified, according to the four officials, each of whom was granted anonymity for fear of retribution. But the material included CISA contracting documents marked “for official use only,” a government designation for information that is considered sensitive and not for public release.\n\n>Cybersecurity sensors at CISA flagged the uploads this past August, said the four officials. One official specified there were multiple such warnings in the first week of August alone. Senior officials at DHS subsequently led an internal review to assess if there had been any harm to government security from the exposures, according to two of the four officials.\n\n>It is not clear what the review concluded.\n\n>In an emailed statement, CISA’s Director of Public Affairs Marci McCarthy said Gottumukkala “was granted permission to use ChatGPT with DHS controls in place,” and that “this use was short-term and limited.” McCarthy added that the agency was committed to “harnessing AI and other cutting-edge technologies to drive government modernization and deliver on” Trump’s executive order [removing barriers to America’s leadership in AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/).\n\n>The email also appeared to dispute the timeline of POLITICO’s reporting: “Acting Director Dr. Madhu Gottumukkala last used ChatGPT in mid-July 2025 under an authorized temporary exception granted to some employees. CISA’s security posture remains to block access to ChatGPT by default unless granted an exception.”\n\n>",

There is a reason mailing lists like Full Disclosure existed and people used aliases to dump bugs they found. Eventually, the getting sued mostly stopped but basically your only reward for a long time was receiving credit on the patch announcement, which got street cred. The bug bounty thing came about after a lot of discussion about how to encourage researchers to report bugs responsibly and reward their efforts.\n\nBug bounty programs still pay very poorly relative to their real world value. You'll never see this change. The reality being that (software esp) security as a whole is viewed as a necessary burden, but budgets and timelines never reflect the real risks involved because it's all preventative. This applies to penetration testing / assessment efforts and bounty payouts. Most companies don't invest what they should to really make their products secure.\n\nThis is all compounded by the amount of work these programs require. People report junk bugs that aren't exploitable then start making demands. It's gotten worse with AI, because now they just run AI and report the bug without ever validating it is actually a bug. I saw several in the Linux kernel reported not long ago and ever single one was AI generated, none were real bugs. This creates a lot of work, but it also predates AI when people would run fuzzers and just report stuff without ever testing it. If people stopped reporting low effort crap then maybe these programs could improve as the cost to maintain them went down.",

The fence team on the other hand knows about dozen, hundreds of such holes. Some are small too, but many are pretty big. And the fence team is working tirelessly at fixing the bigger ones, and there are so many, and so many new are continuously added, they don't expect to ever fix them all.\n\nThat small hole you discovered is just another one, and is added to the pile. It may be important to address right now, but it may also be just a symptom of a bigger problem. You are fixated on your small hole because it's your hole, not because you have a good picture of all the holes there are.\n\nOne of easiest thing in cybersecurity is to find security issues.

The alternative is there is little incentive for you to report issues to the homeowner. No, you cannot expect everybody to just do this kind of work for free just because \"it's the right thing to do\". You cannot expect random people to come audit your home on a regular basis and provide free feedback for you.\n\nYou could decide that you don't care, and will not give out rewards regardless. But you will lose that aspect of security. You cannot expect that with a sufficiently good security program that you will completely mitigate all risks incurred from not having a bug bounty program. If things worked like that, no company would ever have a breach. That doesn't mean having a bug bounty will make you perfectly secure, its just another part of security, another layer in the swiss cheese model.\n\nSince bug bounty programs aren't easy to setup or maintain, lots of hours have to go into replicating and verifying the risk and impact of each submitted bounty, and theres gonna be a lot of bullshit, its not reasonable to expect all organizations of any size to run them.

But what has ended up happening is the creation of a perverse incentive system that rewards a different kind of bad actor - the scripted \"bug finder and reporter\" running on a VPS, with a conversion rate somewhere around 0.0001%, generating tens of thousands of wasted work hours per year.\n\nCollecting bug bounties was never meant to be *an industry*.",

I don't really have a say on what we're paying them, however, it feels like we're paying a ton for resources that don't really fit our needs.\n\nHere's my experience so far: I explain my need, I'm given a few options, and then I'm \"forced\" to choose one of them and I am essentially being told that my feedback on why they wouldn't work for my team is \"wrong.\" This leaves me with a team of fresh grads with zero technical context to run the engagement. We’re stuck redoing half of their reports because they lack the hands on experience in our domain to understand our actual stack. I have received great resources from them in the past, but the quality drop has been insane over the last few months or so.\n\nIs anyone here been in a similar position as me?

The client had each of the Big 4 doing work for them in one part of their business. Each had an army and after 2 years, none of them had delivered on anything. So the client asked us to get involved. The Big 4 promptly got booted out and we were given the work. We ultimately scrapped everything (cheaper than figuring out how to salvage anything) and we got it all done in about 4 months. Afterwards we were at the corporate office and I joked with senior leadership that we offer cybersecurity janitorial services (we clean up others' messes). They chuckled and then complained about the rates we charged. I just asked them how much did they pay the Big 4 for 2 years with zero projects completed. I followed it up with they should just pay us to do the work going forward as it will be done on-time, on-budget, and done right. (Ah, the joys of youth). That was 13 years ago and the client still puts a significant amount of money in our pocket every single year. There is a significant amount of hard earned trust and respect between us. \n\nTLDR: Our rates may be a bit higher but we deliver.\n\nI do recommend considering boutique firms as you can get exceptional service and a quality product for usually a relatively competitive rate.",

They acqui-hired local specialists through the boom period, and anyone senior quit to go do the same thing, for better clients/engagements and more money either solo or for boutique’s.\n\nAI then made its way into every level of consulting at Big 4 and now even their audit function is cancerous, we’re just waiting for the eventual radiation to start once they’re found out. It’s happened to a few regional offices, who’ve completely gutted the function and lost hundreds of millions of contracts,m..\n\n..

I work mostly in offensive security, penetration testing, etc. and almost all of the ones I've encountered are woefully sub-par when it comes to technical ability. \n\nThere are of course great people there, but given how many consultants they have it's unsurprising that the average is pretty low.  \n\nI own a offensive security company - and have worked in the industry for \\~20 years, and am from a very technical background (and still even do testing/VR), so feel that I have the ability to judge this pretty well. \n\nHaving said all that, almost all of the people I've met from big4 are very good consultants in general and while technically perhaps aren't super awesome, they really do blend a lot of parts into the package to be just that, consultants. From my friends who have worked at the big consultancy firms, I'm not surprised that all this seems to be the case as their job requirements also often involve soft-selling and other non-technical requirements too.\n\nTake everything I've said with a pinch of salt because I personally haven't worked at a big4.\n\nMy overall recommendation is to go with small-mid sized companies. Independent contractors - especially for penetration testing - are likely not a good idea. Pentesters will often use contractors/associates to do their work and naturally go through a selection process to ensure the standard is up to scratch and that reports/work is QA'd and meeting a particular standard too.\n\nMy general sense is that small-independent companies that have a good reputation are the best companies to go with - ideally before they've been bought out by bigger companies.\n\nAnother thing to note is that smaller/mid-sized companies are often very much more focused on establishing and keeping a good relationship with their clients - big4 can really take or leave any contracts that are not hitting the millions pretty easily and not sweat it too badly.\n\nI don't know if you're specifically talking about pentesting/offensive security stuff - but I guess my experience in this particular area is replicated across others too.\n\nHope this helps.",

Most have just finished their undergrad degree, more in the accounting side some went straight to a Master's.\n\nI'm fairly certain I remember the titles but I might be off.  They start as associates which do the vast majority of the work, supposedly under the direction of senior associates and managers.  The partners manage the client.  The associates are thrown under the bus and told to go support this client the day they start.  At another company, I worked with someone who had spent years with a Big 4.  He said the second day he was there he was told to fly to a client and one of the other people there would help him learn what he needed to do.\n\nThis model chews through associates at a very high rate of turnover, at most a couple of years.  Then they leave for places with less pressure and just an overall better culture.  \n\nThe ones that stay tend to have the goal of making partner as fast as they can, though a few choose to go down the senior non-partner path for things like director positions.  The main difference is they don't buy into the LLP.",

Is a DBA in IT?  Yes.  Is the VoIP administrator in IT?  Yes.  Do they have much overlap?  No.  They intersect, but don't overlap very much.  The same goes for pen tester, malware engineer, incident responder, and digital forensics engineer.  IT and cybersecurity are incredibly wide fields, and certifications help distinguish a person's experience and skill set in slices of those huge spaces.  Even to the point of this vendor or that one.  An administrator may be responsible for a system that serves thousands of users, and the product has hundreds of developers that have been developing it for 10 years.  It is a huge thing, and something one could build a career around.  A lot of people would have the experience, knowledge, and aptitude to learn to manage it, but someone with a certificate from that vendor, or in that specific role, has evidence that they HAVE learned it, and can be productive very quickly in the role.",

          "text": "I’m not saying certifications are useless. They aren’t. But early in a career, they are often oversold, especially when compared to the long-term value of a solid four-year degree.\n\nI’m a director and manager of a small but highly capable DFIR cyber team that operates as part of a larger cyber organization. I’m directly involved in hiring, mentoring, and developing analysts. What I’m seeing today is very different from what the market looked like even three to five years ago.\n\nThere was a gold rush in cybersecurity. Organizations needed people quickly, and they needed them “good enough” to staff SOCs and respond to alerts. Bootcamps and entry-level certifications filled a real need at the time. They helped people get up to speed on basic tooling and workflows, and for a while that was enough to get hired.\n\nThat phase is over.\n\nThe market has matured. Much of the truly entry-level work has either been offshored, automated, or absorbed by better tooling, better processes, and more efficient teams. What remains are higher-expectation roles that require deeper understanding, better judgment, and the ability to adapt when things do not follow a playbook.\n\nDegrees matter again. Experience matters more. The bar is higher.\n\nWhat I still see, especially on Reddit and similar forums, is people clinging to the gold-rush mentality: get a few certs, land a SOC I role, and get catapulted into a cybersecurity career. That pathway is far less reliable today, and for many people it simply doesn’t work anymore.\n\nCertifications absolutely have a place, but they are not a replacement for a strong foundational education.\n\nA good four-year degree in computer science, computer information systems, or a well-designed cybersecurity program builds something certifications cannot: depth, context, and adaptability. When my team is hiring, I generally prefer candidates with CS or CIS degrees over narrowly focused cyber degrees. Those candidates consistently demonstrate broader technical understanding and stronger problem-solving skills.\n\nCS and CIS graduates tend to understand how systems actually work, not just how to operate tools. They are more comfortable with ambiguity. They reason better when something breaks in a way they haven’t seen before. They can pivot when a tool fails, logs don’t line up, or an incident doesn’t match a textbook scenario.\n\nThat matters in DFIR. It matters in mature cyber environments.\n\nI can teach the cybersecurity specifics, our workflows, our tools, our processes, relatively quickly if the person already has a solid technical foundation. I cannot easily teach systems thinking, troubleshooting intuition, or years of exposure to operating systems, networking, programming concepts, and data structures if those fundamentals were skipped.\n\nThis is where certifications fit best: continuing education.\n\nCerts are excellent for learning specific tools, platforms, or methodologies. They are valuable when someone already understands the underlying technology and has real-world experience to anchor that knowledge. Used that way, they are powerful. Used as a substitute for foundational education, they are fragile.\n\nHome labs, YouTube videos, and self-study are all useful, but they are not the same as being accountable in a real environment, working real incidents, under real constraints, with real consequences. A four-year degree, especially an in-person program done well, exposes students to that rigor over time and forces them to build habits that matter later in their careers.\n\nFaster is not always better.\n\nIf someone is early in their career and serious about cybersecurity as a long-term profession, not just landing their first job, the strongest path is still a solid four-year technical degree, followed by experience, and then certifications layered on top. That combination produces professionals who can grow, adapt, and remain relevant long after the latest tool or cert falls out of favor.\n\nThat’s what mature cyber teams are looking for now.",

They are also important for advancing your career into management, but if that’s not of interest, they are not totally necessary. \n\nExperience is what rounds you out and understanding at least a base level of hands on networking and sysadmin is really beneficial when it comes to cybersecurity. \n\nThe trifecta is all three, with the degree gaining more ground in times like these when there are fewer and harder to get jobs.

I think another important aspect is that having the cert tells people that don't know you what you know. As someone who is new to this, if I see that someone has a high level cert AND relevant experience, that tells me that that's someone probably worth trying to network with and possibly learn something from.\n\nAre certs perfect representations of knowledge and experience?

Companies pay IT people to get certifications.. so someone with certifications is more likely to have experience... so you filter for people that have certifications and that knocks out inexperienced people. IT and cyber both have thousands of applicants per job due to the market collapse. Struggle is real.\n\nRegarding degrees, people without those dont really get hired often because degrees are also an easy filter. The job itself usually doesnt require deep theory knowledge unless you're the one automating the job away.",

It is a baseline that many people judge others as \"qualified\". \n\nOne problem I have seen with degrees is the information is often outdated even before the degree is issued. A textbook takes more than a year to be written and approved. Then a curriculum and tests take another year to produce. A textbook usually is only updated every 3-5 years so course work in practice can be 7 years old. For general subjects that is fine but for cutting edge IT like cyber security that is very outdated.\n\nA certificate shows a shorter duration in taking a specialized class and can pass a test. Some certificates are valuable in a specialized subject and others are basically worthless. \n\nWork experience in the field shows that an employee has shown up and actually has done the job.",

For example, if an application works fine and the design is useful, then you know that UX/UI and developers are doing their job. \n\nAnd people try to extrapolate the same premise to security. If you were never hacked, people assume your security is good (either because your employees have the proper awareness or your security team is doing a fine job). That gives a false sense of security. \n\nBut as we know, that couldn't be farther from reality. You may be secure just because you haven't become a prominent target. But that can change fast as well as your exposure.\n\nSo unfortunately, sometimes you need to wait until something really bad happens in order to make security relevant.",

You do it to make money. The part about doing things the right way inevitably costs more money than doing them the wrong but cheap way. So in the end, to a certain short-sighted mentality, we're the people making you make less money than you could. A cost center. We're not generating any revenue over here. We're not giving you new capabilities relevant to your mission. We're over here spending money, taking money, and occasionally butting in and telling you \"no dont do that\".",

The only calculus is in \"best practices\", \"vibes\", or thoughtlessly following NIST 800-53 or other frameworks (e.g., mandating password changes in 2026 when paired with strong MFA -- assuming no evidence of compromise).\n2. Skills: A lot of cyber guys simply don't have enough engineering skills to earn the respect of developers, also related to #1. This also goes the other way, too. How many cyber teams out there are staffed with glorified sysadmins who on;y know how to manage vendor solutions, not real hackers? How many cyber engineers don't really know linux, or deep network internals, etc?\n3. Culture: The team of \"no\", instead of \"yes, and\" - or better stated - allow us to derisk where you are trying to go. A world of bureaucracy and process, instead of paved roads with guiderails. tl;dr, too much friction, not enough consideration of the \"user experience\" - be it for developers, endusers, customers, etc.\n\nIn a world where cyber professionals were more calculated about risk and had deeper skills across the stack, I think they would be a lot more respected.\n\nSource: used to own cyber function in a smaller org, now don't work in cyber in a large org and see it from both sides.",

Now that it's being dismantled, things will get worse for our colleagues on the ground trying to defend organizations like your local hospitals, schools and utilities.\n\nThis is everything that foreign threat actors could have hoped for. Life is going to be more chaotic and IT and OT systems will be less reliable. It will put people at risk, and it will definitely cost the economy.

The one interesting thing about Stuxnet is that due to how sophisticated and how much patience it took at the time, most strategic level systems have adapted several layers of security controls to interrupt an attack like this occuring again.\n\nWannacry was likely the most impactful on a consumer basis and it definitely changed people's perception on how to protect their information.\n\nNotPetya was the most destructive\n\nThe eternalblue exploit that allowed both Wannacry and NotPetya to happen was really just par for course with regards to a big corporation giving a security agency backdoor access to devices. The 2 attacks that happened off the back of it really only served to validate the conspiracy theorists.\n\nBut Solarwinds changed the way security systems had to detect. Up until the solarwinds attack, security had been primarily a signature based detection system, and the only security tools that actually detected something was funky with what was going on with Orion were vendors implementing early heuristics based detection. This also changed the threat vector prioprioritisations worldwide. Realising suddenly that your greatest cybersecurity risk could be your most trusted vendor was a hard pill to swallow for everyone.\n\nThe Solarwinds attack compromised more government systems and critical infrastructure than any other attack, and not in a wanton destruction kinda way like NotPetya did. I believe that because of the solarwinds attack, we're unlikely to see attacks like Stuxnet succeed again, as the higher level attacks that do succeed to find a way in typically opt for a smash and grab style of attack more than any particular goal. This might also be due to advancements in things like bandwidth where prioritising large data sets over strategic targets makes more sense, but either way, Solarwinds attack caused the biggest individual shift in cybersecurity out of the big ones.",

Optus is a part of the big three mobile network providers in Australia, in fact, they almost hold a triopoly alongside telstra and vodaphone. Back in 2023, they had a massive data leak, which exposed really sensitive information. When they were investigated, they found records of Optus investing their funds into more bullshit rather than investing in their cybersecurity infrastructure, which pressured the CEO to step down. Optus was one of the main examples that brought in new cybersecurity laws regarding company negligence. Later last year, 3 emergency service outages happened, where Optus was the main company contracted by the government to maintain emergency service calls. This time it wasn't a cyberattack, but just pure negligence just like what happened back in 2023. Two of the main Optus executives resigned after this lmao. After this, new laws were also introduced that forced all telecommunications providers to have a supervisory firm to check if everything is up to date, and finding if certain systems meet certain criteria.",

Long enough that people assume I \"see it\". But there are still times when I'm looking at logs or network flows and thinking: I really don't know what this means.\"\n\nExample from lately:\n\nA sudden burst of approximately 1, 000 connection attempts in less than a second between internal servers, all over port 445. No payloads. No follow, up behavior that is obvious. Everything technically \"allowed.\"\n\nNothing triggered hard alerts. No malware signatures. No obvious lateral movement.\n\nAnd yet... it felt wrong.\n\nThis is what really shakes me up.\n\nI can tell the data, but I find it hard to adequately tell what it means.\n\nIs this normal service behavior? A configuration error? Backup chatter? A scanning artifact? Something benign that I simply haven't seen enough times?\n\nIm sufficiently informed to be concerned, not sufficiently informed to be sure.\n\nAnd that gap feels dreadful.\n\nFor those of you whove done this longer:\n\nDid it ever go away for you?\n\nWas there a time when network/security data suddenly \"clicked\"?\n\nOr is it just part of the job that never totally vanishes?\n\nBesides, if you did better at this:  \nWhat actually helped?

Yeah, all the time.\n\nHowever, ***knowing how to find the answer*** is what separates the good from bad. \n\nPort 445 is SMB, which is how machines in an AD envionment talk to each other. Common example, accessing a share drive, browsing folders, and opening a file; that's SMB traffic. If you didn't know that off the top of your head, you can google \"port 445 traffic\".\n\nSo, what you saw is probably just someone or something (maybe an application?) saving/reading/writing a bunch of files. \n\nNext step would be to figure out the owner of the device and just say \"hey you got any jobs that run at XYZ time?\". If no owner, go ahead and get on that device, use a traffic analyzer to figure out what process is sending what traffic, chances are it'll point you straight to the service/exe that's doing it.\n\nBeing able to do stuff like this comes naturally if you started your cybersecurity career in IT/sysadmin/networking roles, as you've configured/deployed/admin'd systems enough to know to do this. But you should always strive to find out the answer!",

In my SIEM I don't have non-malicious file system activity logged by every process (in a sysinternals process monitor/explorer fashion).  But SMB file activity on every server and endpoint **IS** logged.  So there's no guessing about wether that looks like human activity, surveillance, exfiltration...  Was it just file listing enumeration in the form of a directory search, or was content actually read.  Was the read, every file in directory list order in the style of search index reading, or selective....\nBut also when you have full process logging on the servers and endpoints... you can just read when End User X ran ```DIR [directory] *.* /s``` at the terminal, or some other expected productivity app in that time span with the expectation of bulk file activity.... or not.  And perhaps it's an exe with a familiar name but not where it's expected to be, running as System, with a low reputation score.  And then you corelate that with the DNS and inbound/outbound network activity (c2/shell etc).",

You can do some lanmanserver hardening, but if you don't need shares, it's safest to turn server service off. It takes simple adding of network to your own to mess with you from your own lan. You can even see networks added names if you install peerblock. And if uac isn't set to max, copying files doesn't require perms. If you're disabling server service, it might be wise to disable workstation and secondary logon services aswell.

          "text": "Oh, for sure. Part of the trick of working in security is getting comfortable with having no clue what you are looking at but being justifiably confident that you will learn and understand it after some research and review because you have done that enough times to prove to yourself that you can do it.\n\nIt can be a little disconcerting at first to pick up an alert or otherwise start working on something when you don't know what it is at the time you start...but eventually you will often come to *crave* the unknown like that, because if you *have* seen something before and know exactly what you are looking at from the beginning then it probably means it is going to be boring and tedious (like a false positive that can't yet be easily tuned out).\n\nIn terms of getting your head around something, one of the first things I always do when investigating is look for other examples of the traffic I'm analyzing across different time scales -- for example, if I see a burst of traffic I will isolate it and then look at the last week or two and see if there have been other similar instances. \n\nWith SMB traffic, it is quite common to see similar bursts of traffic at a regular time each week or each month because networks often have lots of automated jobs or other such routine activity, and it can sometimes look weird in isolation but when you see that it happens every week at 2 pm on Tuesday or whatever it becomes very obvious that it is some regular process (and you can often even find the team / calendar that documents it).\n\nIf you haven't already, I would definitely recommend making sure you have access / familiarity with the calendars / scheduling for IT changes and other such activity -- being able to tie weird traffic to these processes can help *tremendously* in figuring out what something is, because most anomalous activity in your network is going to be your own IT folks making changes and troubleshooting various things.\n\nAnother good rule of thumb: don't get spooked too quickly by an alert or something else you see if it's new -- like, if a new alert has been deployed, or if you just got access to a new log source. Because odds are whatever you're seeing has been going on for a while and you just haven't been watching it, so it is far more likely that it is routine and you just haven't yet understood it vs you just caught some horrible attack in progress in the nic of time! So take some time to look at it and understand it before getting too nervous about it.\n\nI used to work with someone who, without fail, would send urgent emails and run around aggressively demanding answers from people and otherwise stressing everyone out every time we deployed a new alert or got a new log source (or sometimes even because he found or remembered we had some source he hadn't looked at in a while). He would see something he didn't understand, quickly jump to the conclusion that it was suspicious, and before sitting with it and actually figuring out what it was he would start acting on it.\n\nDon't be that guy.\n\nFor one, he pissed everybody off for no reason. But more importantly, he also greatly undermined his own credibility on anything, because if the security guy (who is supposed to be watching everything and spotting malicious activity) randomly freaks out about a weekly file transfer that has been happening for 5 years it makes it painfully clear that he *isn't* watching everything, and *can't* spot malicious activity because he couldn't (or didn't take the time to) tell the difference between something malicious and something utterly routine.\n\nTake your time, think logically, do lots of research and googling, correlate network activity with scheduled changes and other such activity (ie don't get so fixated on just the technology that you forget that it is being used by people who are doing work stuff), and you'll figure it out!",
