      "text": "[https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/cisa-madhu-gottumukkala-chatgpt-00749361](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/cisa-madhu-gottumukkala-chatgpt-00749361)\n\n>  \nThe interim head of the country’s cyber defense agency uploaded sensitive contracting documents into a public version of ChatGPT last summer, triggering multiple automated security warnings that are meant to stop the theft or unintentional disclosure of government material from federal networks, according to four Department of Homeland Security officials with knowledge of the incident.\n\n>The apparent misstep from Madhu Gottumukkala was especially noteworthy because the acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had requested special permission from CISA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer to use the popular AI tool soon after arriving at the agency this May, three of the officials said. The app was blocked for other DHS employees at the time.\n\n>None of the files Gottumukkala plugged into ChatGPT were classified, according to the four officials, each of whom was granted anonymity for fear of retribution. But the material included CISA contracting documents marked “for official use only,” a government designation for information that is considered sensitive and not for public release.\n\n>Cybersecurity sensors at CISA flagged the uploads this past August, said the four officials. One official specified there were multiple such warnings in the first week of August alone. Senior officials at DHS subsequently led an internal review to assess if there had been any harm to government security from the exposures, according to two of the four officials.\n\n>It is not clear what the review concluded.\n\n>In an emailed statement, CISA’s Director of Public Affairs Marci McCarthy said Gottumukkala “was granted permission to use ChatGPT with DHS controls in place,” and that “this use was short-term and limited.” McCarthy added that the agency was committed to “harnessing AI and other cutting-edge technologies to drive government modernization and deliver on” Trump’s executive order [removing barriers to America’s leadership in AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/).\n\n>The email also appeared to dispute the timeline of POLITICO’s reporting: “Acting Director Dr. Madhu Gottumukkala last used ChatGPT in mid-July 2025 under an authorized temporary exception granted to some employees. CISA’s security posture remains to block access to ChatGPT by default unless granted an exception.”\n\n>",

Probably what happened was a random user came up with something amazing, OpenAI siphoned it, (as they do, through cybersecurity methods) it turned out to be extremely important.\n\nSo now the official narrative is “Trump’s cyber security Chief uploaded it accidentally.”\n\nI don’t trust this for a second. People come up with amazing things using AI and it gets swiped. STOLEN.\n\nAsk Suchir Balaji. Oh wait, that’s right, Suchir Balaji is dead.\n\nSomeone should connect these dots before the elite destroy this planet…\n\nElla Cook. Nuno Loureiro, Feng Yanghe, TANG XIAOOU, HE ZHI, ZHANG DAIBING, QUAN YUHUI.\n\nAll dead. All working on high value, high target things. Once their work was completed… DEAD.\n\nIt’s all right there. Nobody cares. People make silly AI pictures and complain about small things like AI stole their pictures, and novels, and videos... It’s sickening.\n\nAI companies steal BIG things.\n\nSuchir Balaji knew that. He was a whistleblower. Now he’s dead. Everyone on this list is dead. How did that happen? Uh, maybe… the government had them murdered?!",

We show an adversary can extract gigabytes of training data from open-source language models like Pythia or GPT-Neo, semi-open models like LLaMA or Falcon, and closed models like ChatGPT. Existing techniques from the literature suffice to attack unaligned models; in order to attack the aligned ChatGPT, we develop a new divergence attack that causes the model to diverge from its chatbot-style generations and emit training data at a rate 150x higher than when behaving properly. Our methods show practical attacks can recover far more data than previously thought, and reveal that current alignment techniques do not eliminate memorization.",

What to look out for:\n\n* gup.exe making network requests for other than: notepad-plus-plus.org, github.com and release-assets.githubusercontent.com.\n* gup.exe for unusual process subspawns — it should only spawn explorer.exe, and npp\\* themed Notepad++ installers. For 8.8.8 and 8.8.7 they should have valid digital signatures, and be signed by GlobalSign.\n* Files called update.exe or AutoUpdater.exe in user TEMP folder, where gup.exe has written and/or executed the files.\n* Use of curl.exe (bundled with Windows 10 and above) to call out to temp.sh for recon activity. [Example](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*c047T4mh0h5xOjl_ZiyL0A.png). You’ll notice AutoUpdater.exe — which isn’t a part of Notepad++, Notepad++ doesn’t use that filename at all — executing with the parameter /closeRunningNpp, which is called by the legit Notepad++ updater process — essentially, something else is in the update chain somehow in this example. The cause isn’t known in that case but it may be related to this blog.",

If you disable biometric unlock:\n\n\n\n1. You MUST use a strong passphrase (15+ chars, mixed case). A simple PIN can be brute-forced in seconds during custody.\n\n\n\n2. Consider enabling a \"Duress PIN\" feature if available (newer Android/iOS). This logs you in without alerting the device they cracked it.\n\n\n\n3. Backup authentication factors (security keys, TOTP apps) should be stored separately from your primary device.\n\n\n\n4. The WaPo case highlights law enforcement's legal uncertainty here - they used biometrics in a warrantless seizure, which may not hold up under 5th Amendment challenges (unlike passcodes, which courts treat differently).\n\n\n\nThe real security posture: Layered authentication + understanding your threat model. If LEA is your primary threat, yes disable biometrics. If it's account takeover, keep them enabled with strong backup auth.",

The benefit they get to see all data far outweighs the cost. Whats a few instances of China being able to snoop compared against having unimpeded access to all of your populace's data?\n\nEven if China benefits, lets say 1 time every 3 years, and is able to snoop into something they shouldn't have. Weigh that against being able to police your people 24/7, 7 days a week, for the full year without any technological roadblocks. The benefit of having all that data to solve/investigate the most pressing immediate issues: domestic terrorism, groups you don't like, criminals, every police investigation with an encrypted device/application. Those benefits far exceed the cost of losing some info to China every once in a while. The truly important state secrets can be kept off the internet entirely, in secure facilities.\n\nYou can point at instances where adversaries benefit all you want. But in the back of those government officials mind's, all they can think of is how useful this has been to establish control over information, despite a few instances where adversaries were able to benefit somewhat.",

The mandatory shortening of SSL cert lifetimes is 100% because the browser & CA vendors don't want to fix cert revocation, even though we have fixed the problem.\n\nWhat exact risk do short-lived certs address if not revocation?  There isn't one, because allowing 1 year certs (forgetting we used to have 2-5 years without issue) was never an issue.  They'll coo about \"Oh but what if your private key is compromised?\" which is, again, a revocation issue, and also a hypothetical scenario that has failed to be realized into a real issue.",

      "text": "I've been working for 2 years as a mid-level manager for a medium-sized fintech company based somewhere in Asia. I work as an individual contributor reporting directly to the CISO though my tasks require me to work a lot cross-functionally with other team members.\n\nI accomplished a lot with our previous CISO before he left the company mid last year. Then around 6 months ago, a new chief came in. It turns out that he was previously a CISO of one of the largest fintech companies globally which I'm sure everyone here has heard of. Apparently, the CEO knew him when they worked together in the previous conpany.\n\nWe worked in different regional offices and barely spoke in the first 2-3 months despite me actively reaching out to him several times. He didn't set any weekly meetings with me or the broader team, nor he even tried to understand what my tasks were and learn about the current state of things.\n\nOftentimes, I would DM him to get an approval or an update, but he wouldn't respond until a day or two. He would just reply 'OK' or totally ignore my messages. Naturally, I was pissed but I just continued my daily BAU tasks.\n\nHe's Chinese (which I don't speak), but he understood and spoke English well enough on a conversational level.\n\nAround 3 months in, he started becoming a bit more active. We started having weekly updates with him, however, he also asked me and his other direct reports to report directly to the president. He let us do the updates on our own per team and sometimes he wouldn't speak a single word throughout the call. This pissed a lot of us since we all understood that it should be his job as CISO. All directives came from the president and he never started any initiatives on his own. Basically, he just let us do whatever we want.\n\nAt the start of the year, the audit from our regulator began. Our team was asked to do an overview presentation and he asked us to fill in the slides though the auditor required that it should be him to present it. All he had to do was understand and explain the slides.\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon before the presentation, he sent a group message to all us his direct reports that we should do a write up for him on the slides and we should complete it before the day ends so he can review it (mind you, the presentation was still on Wednesday). I was in utter disbelief when I read this. I was out with my family at the time and won't be back until after dinner. Of course, the rest of the team and I did it for him.\n\nOn the day of the presentation, I was sitting in the office room together with our regulators. He was put on call as he was allowed to do it remotely. To no surprise, he read the write-up word per word like an AI voice-over. It was painfully obvious for everyone in the room, but since we're behind schedule, they just let him be. I could've summarized and explained all the slides by heart.\n\nTo this day, I don't think he understands what the team is doing. They say a CISO's first 100 days should be enough to build a roadmap for the team. We're way past that and we're still nowhere near any semblance of one, and my colleagues already started leaving one by one.\n\nThat's all he is to me -- a decorative wallflower.\n\nAny ideas on how to deal with this situation?",

A man who claims to be a realist has to challenge the whole of the ancient faith. If it does not stand the onslaught of reason it crumbles down.\"\n\nSimilarly, if you, the cyber professional, cannot answer 5 Whys about your policies, security controls, or your security solutions, people stop paying attention to you, your voice loses value. If the only thing that comes to your mind is \"this is policy\", you are the problem.\n\n\nNow that you have identified the problem, start working towards a solution. Develop some empathy, walk a mile in the opposite person's shoes, understand what they are trying to do, how can you help to make their job/task/activity safe. If you don't know, be honest. I do not know everything. Nobody is putting a gun to your head and demanding an answer right away.

For example, if an application works fine and the design is useful, then you know that UX/UI and developers are doing their job. \n\nAnd people try to extrapolate the same premise to security. If you were never hacked, people assume your security is good (either because your employees have the proper awareness or your security team is doing a fine job). That gives a false sense of security. \n\nBut as we know, that couldn't be farther from reality. You may be secure just because you haven't become a prominent target. But that can change fast as well as your exposure.\n\nSo unfortunately, sometimes you need to wait until something really bad happens in order to make security relevant.",

Skills: A lot of cyber guys simply don't have enough engineering skills to earn the respect of developers, also related to #1. This also goes the other way, too. How many cyber teams out there are staffed with glorified sysadmins who on;y know how to manage vendor solutions, not real hackers? How many cyber engineers don't really know linux, or deep network internals, etc?\n3. Culture: The team of \"no\", instead of \"yes, and\" - or better stated - allow us to derisk where you are trying to go. A world of bureaucracy and process, instead of paved roads with guiderails. tl;dr, too much friction, not enough consideration of the \"user experience\" - be it for developers, endusers, customers, etc.\n\nIn a world where cyber professionals were more calculated about risk and had deeper skills across the stack, I think they would be a lot more respected.\n\nSource: used to own cyber function in a smaller org, now don't work in cyber in a large org and see it from both sides.",

But once you have given yourself a little time, pick yourself up, brush yourself off, and get back out there. \n\nRemember the guys we're defending against have bad days too.

When talking to them its clear they want in because they think cyber is an easy field to get in that pays well. “I dont want to code” is a common response I see so instead of SWE they go for cyber. What is making people think you just need a pulse and a few book knowledge of a few network protocols and you should be golden? Its kinda insulting when the UPS driver says I dont want to code or go to school, but i want to get into cyber……what?\n\nEverybody get your money, but understand theres almost no shortcuts. This is why we see 200+ applicants on a job posted a hour ago. Idk how so many people adopted this belief.\n\nThis isnt a bash post, not my intention. Just pointing out its not easy, a degree is needed and the “ i dont want to code” mindset kind of points out the pretenders from those that are serious. Who wants to do something 100x when you can automate it",

That isn't to say that there aren't some particular specialisations you can't excel in early, but they're typically risky fields to play in without a solid head screwed on, and unless you're the Electron or Phoenix type, you're typically not getting hired by the agencies you end up probing anyway.\n\nGet experience in networking, get experience in servers, databases, some coding if possible, and expose yourself to as much different types of technologies, brands and stacks as possible til you can instinctively tie anything you look at to a particular layer of OSI or other model with complete comprehension how they cross interact. Then get into cyber.\n\nOr sit at a SOC watch logs scroll on your screen all day and pass alerts to the senior security engineers for the same amount of time on the hopes that someone will take you under their wing.\n\nEdit: To add, Cybersecurity has to have some of the worst work/life balance ratios in an industry notorious for terrible work/life balance as it is. It is NOT a walk in the park, and you are assuming so much more responsibility and liability for negligent actions when you claim \"cybersecurity\".",

Also, like other people have said here there was a ton of social media posts and YouTube videos that were constantly saying that you could break into the industry and make good money. On top of that there were a ton of recruiters recruiting for colleges and other courses that were telling everyone how much money they'd make as long as they got a degree or some certifications through them. With out all these together the industry exploded in visual appeal.",

AI has taken a vast majority of low skilled or straight out of college positions.  Yes there are jobs available but realistically the number of low skilled positions are very limited.  On most job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) if you don’t know someone at the company that is hiring you have a nearly a 0% chance at getting even an interview.  A new job gets posted and within 2 hours more than 500 people submit an application.  From those everything is scanned by AI to find the top 5 candidates for an interview. Federal workers with 10+ years are being laid off and then are applying to 100 jobs over 8+ months before getting rehired.  Top analysts at major companies like Crowdstrike, big accounting and consulting firms are all being let go as nearly every company is restructuring positions and replacing many bodies with AI.",
