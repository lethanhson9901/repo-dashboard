He currently serves as a Director at CrowdStrike following the sale of his company Iperlane in 2017. Vincenzo is also a Network Leader at Village Global, a seed stage VC fund based in Silicon Valley. In addition, Vincenzo is an Associate Researcher at the MIT Media Lab and serves as a committee member on the Black Hat Conference board. Vincenzo co-authored the “iOS Hacker’s Handbook” (Wiley, 2012) and was part of the winning teams that attacked Firefox, iOS and Blackberry OS at Pwn2Own between 2010-2012.\n\nhttps://cylonlab.com/mentors/vincenzo-iozzo/\n\n\nInteresting that this was from a confidential source that the FBI used more than once and is one of the few formerly classified released tip docs I’ve seen so far. That being said, it’s still not confirmed.",

We show an adversary can extract gigabytes of training data from open-source language models like Pythia or GPT-Neo, semi-open models like LLaMA or Falcon, and closed models like ChatGPT. Existing techniques from the literature suffice to attack unaligned models; in order to attack the aligned ChatGPT, we develop a new divergence attack that causes the model to diverge from its chatbot-style generations and emit training data at a rate 150x higher than when behaving properly. Our methods show practical attacks can recover far more data than previously thought, and reveal that current alignment techniques do not eliminate memorization.",

That doesn't excuse letting users know what is going on when you know more info. Considering that the software was vulnerable to hijacked updates since July, everyone needs more information to make sure there's not a dweller just sitting on their networks.\n\nResponsible disclosure is necessary - even for free and open-source software.

What to look out for:\n\n* gup.exe making network requests for other than: notepad-plus-plus.org, github.com and release-assets.githubusercontent.com.\n* gup.exe for unusual process subspawns — it should only spawn explorer.exe, and npp\\* themed Notepad++ installers. For 8.8.8 and 8.8.7 they should have valid digital signatures, and be signed by GlobalSign.\n* Files called update.exe or AutoUpdater.exe in user TEMP folder, where gup.exe has written and/or executed the files.\n* Use of curl.exe (bundled with Windows 10 and above) to call out to temp.sh for recon activity. [Example](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*c047T4mh0h5xOjl_ZiyL0A.png). You’ll notice AutoUpdater.exe — which isn’t a part of Notepad++, Notepad++ doesn’t use that filename at all — executing with the parameter /closeRunningNpp, which is called by the legit Notepad++ updater process — essentially, something else is in the update chain somehow in this example. The cause isn’t known in that case but it may be related to this blog.\n\nA more detailed report with [IOCs](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/#indicators-of-compromise-iocs-).",

Consider enabling a \"Duress PIN\" feature if available (newer Android/iOS). This logs you in without alerting the device they cracked it.\n\n\n\n3. Backup authentication factors (security keys, TOTP apps) should be stored separately from your primary device.\n\n\n\n4. The WaPo case highlights law enforcement's legal uncertainty here - they used biometrics in a warrantless seizure, which may not hold up under 5th Amendment challenges (unlike passcodes, which courts treat differently).\n\n\n\nThe real security posture: Layered authentication + understanding your threat model. If LEA is your primary threat, yes disable biometrics. If it's account takeover, keep them enabled with strong backup auth.",

If you're breached, the damage is done within, at most, days. Swapping that password every 90 days to shut the door on them accomplishes essentially nothing, since permanency (if relevant) is far more likely to be accomplished by using my creds to install something that gives access, rather than repeated direct logins that an IPS might raise an eyebrow over.

Defender signatures don’t save you when the execution path is signed, trusted, and user-assisted by design.\nAnd yeah, it hits harder knowing this cash-printing monopoly happily takes government contracts while bankrolling and politically enabling genocide, then turns around and lectures customers about “shared responsibility.” Spare us. You can’t virtue-signal security while shipping a productivity suite that’s still one malformed document away from domain compromise.\nPatch fast, disable Office macros for real, enforce ASR rules, block child process spawning, and assume every Office file is hostile. Microsoft won’t fix the incentives — only admins cleaning up their mess will.\nDammn feels like i talked so much but would a thing be changed real soon? Not particularly no..",

A lot of you are saying that that this is „old news“ - but from my understanding the big difference to the December reporting is that it was no attack via DNS/ISP with enormous manual effort but rather the NPP hosting infrastructure compromised for quite a long time.\n\nAre people still assuming that the victims were selectively targeted? I find it quite likely that a second wave could’ve been much broader.\n\nI see the rapid7 report mentioned often but even they are writing in their first few paragraphs that they were not able to determine the initial scope of infrastructure compromise. And the incident report from the NPP developer is vague at best.\n\nWhat are your actual strategies right now? With the info at hand we are looking at a full reinstall of clients using notepad++.\n\nEDIT: Does someone know the old hosting provider used by notepad++? We have a lot of update routines identified via our xdr and knowing what „legitimate“ would be really helpful.",

If you can't trust the update server you can't trust any code written on that machine.\n\nThis is why reproducible builds and signed binaries matter but also why we need better tooling to verify tool integrity post-install.

We'll have to wait for more info on what that looked like, though.\n\nRight now, most orgs I've heard from are forcing updates to the app, then sweeping devices for any sign of the rogue binaries and logs for any sign of weird outbound communications.  Of course, a lot of orgs have no way to force updates, and even more don't have logs to look at - so that's going to be painful and will probably result in re-imaging devices. \n\nOh, and the other big difference between the most recent report and the one we got yesterday was that this had been going on since June - \\*much\\* longer than the original report thought it had.  That meant a much larger number of versions that could have been compromised.  \n\nSo, partially old news, but also some pretty shocking new information.  The non-technical analogy is a news report about a massive fire at a manufacturing plant, then a follow-up story two months later about how investigators found that the plant was leeching toxic chemicals into the groundwater for years, but it never would have been discovered if the fire investigation hasn't uncovered it.

However, the attackers managed to maintain access to internal services until December 2025.\n\nReports indicate that the threat actors continuously changed server addresses to distribute malicious updates. In one of the campaigns, the actors caused the victim to download a malicious `.exe` file, which turned out to be an NSIS installer of approximately 1 MB named “Chrysalis.” Upon execution, the actor uses `cmd` and `curl` to send system information to the attackers. Chrysalis is a backdoor that executes several files in `%appdata%\\ProShow`; one of these corresponds to legitimate ProShow software, which is used to run the final payload.\n\nThe payload contains two shellcodes. One of them includes junk code; however, the second retrieves Metasploit, which then downloads a Cobalt Strike beacon designed to establish a connection with the threat actor’s Command and Control (C&C) server.\n\nIn another campaign, the attackers added several commands to gather information from the victim’s machine, such as `whoami`, `tasklist`, `systeminfo`, and `netstat`. In general, the campaigns show slight variations, such as the URL used to download the Chrysalis backdoor, its size, and the paths where executables are stored. However, their objective remains the same: to obtain Metasploit and download the Cobalt Strike beacon.",

The fact that you are discouraged means you actually care, which puts you ahead of a lot of people who coast. That feeling sucks right now but it is fuel if you channel it right.\n\n2. Coding assessments in security interviews are a weird filter. Most security engineers I have worked with are not developers - they are problem solvers who can script when needed. If this role requires heavy development, it might not be the right fit, and that is okay. If they are just using it as a general filter, that is a sign the hiring process is broken, not that you are broken.\n\nPractical suggestion: take note of every question you stumbled on and spend the next two weeks filling those specific gaps. Not generic \"study more\" but targeted practice on exactly where you fell short. That turns a bad interview into a free assessment of what to work on next.\n\nFour years in this field is solid.

It felt like the interviewer had read my mind and knew EXACTLY which weird little corner cases in my role I had the least experience in, and he went after my knowledge in those areas with laser-precision lol.  \n\nI felt like a complete fraud afterwards, but in time I realized that I just got unlucky and had a bad interview. It's hard to gauge someones ability in only an hour of awkward conversation with some coding puzzles. Just trust that in time, the negative feelings will fade.

      "text": "I've been working for 2 years as a mid-level manager for a medium-sized fintech company based somewhere in Asia. I work as an individual contributor reporting directly to the CISO though my tasks require me to work a lot cross-functionally with other team members.\n\nI accomplished a lot with our previous CISO before he left the company mid last year. Then around 6 months ago, a new chief came in. It turns out that he was previously a CISO of one of the largest fintech companies globally which I'm sure everyone here has heard of. Apparently, the CEO knew him when they worked together in the previous conpany.\n\nWe worked in different regional offices and barely spoke in the first 2-3 months despite me actively reaching out to him several times. He didn't set any weekly meetings with me or the broader team, nor he even tried to understand what my tasks were and learn about the current state of things.\n\nOftentimes, I would DM him to get an approval or an update, but he wouldn't respond until a day or two. He would just reply 'OK' or totally ignore my messages. Naturally, I was pissed but I just continued my daily BAU tasks.\n\nHe's Chinese (which I don't speak), but he understood and spoke English well enough on a conversational level.\n\nAround 3 months in, he started becoming a bit more active. We started having weekly updates with him, however, he also asked me and his other direct reports to report directly to the president. He let us do the updates on our own per team and sometimes he wouldn't speak a single word throughout the call. This pissed a lot of us since we all understood that it should be his job as CISO. All directives came from the president and he never started any initiatives on his own. Basically, he just let us do whatever we want.\n\nAt the start of the year, the audit from our regulator began. Our team was asked to do an overview presentation and he asked us to fill in the slides though the auditor required that it should be him to present it. All he had to do was understand and explain the slides.\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon before the presentation, he sent a group message to all us his direct reports that we should do a write up for him on the slides and we should complete it before the day ends so he can review it (mind you, the presentation was still on Wednesday). I was in utter disbelief when I read this. I was out with my family at the time and won't be back until after dinner. Of course, the rest of the team and I did it for him.\n\nOn the day of the presentation, I was sitting in the office room together with our regulators. He was put on call as he was allowed to do it remotely. To no surprise, he read the write-up word per word like an AI voice-over. It was painfully obvious for everyone in the room, but since we're behind schedule, they just let him be. I could've summarized and explained all the slides by heart.\n\nTo this day, I don't think he understands what the team is doing. They say a CISO's first 100 days should be enough to build a roadmap for the team. We're way past that and we're still nowhere near any semblance of one, and my colleagues already started leaving one by one.\n\nThat's all he is to me -- a decorative wallflower.\n\nAny ideas on how to deal with this situation?",

When talking to them its clear they want in because they think cyber is an easy field to get in that pays well. “I dont want to code” is a common response I see so instead of SWE they go for cyber. What is making people think you just need a pulse and a few book knowledge of a few network protocols and you should be golden? Its kinda insulting when the UPS driver says I dont want to code or go to school, but i want to get into cyber……what?\n\nEverybody get your money, but understand theres almost no shortcuts. This is why we see 200+ applicants on a job posted a hour ago. Idk how so many people adopted this belief.\n\nThis isnt a bash post, not my intention. Just pointing out its not easy, a degree is needed and the “ i dont want to code” mindset kind of points out the pretenders from those that are serious. Who wants to do something 100x when you can automate it",

That isn't to say that there aren't some particular specialisations you can't excel in early, but they're typically risky fields to play in without a solid head screwed on, and unless you're the Electron or Phoenix type, you're typically not getting hired by the agencies you end up probing anyway.\n\nGet experience in networking, get experience in servers, databases, some coding if possible, and expose yourself to as much different types of technologies, brands and stacks as possible til you can instinctively tie anything you look at to a particular layer of OSI or other model with complete comprehension how they cross interact. Then get into cyber.\n\nOr sit at a SOC watch logs scroll on your screen all day and pass alerts to the senior security engineers for the same amount of time on the hopes that someone will take you under their wing.\n\nEdit: To add, Cybersecurity has to have some of the worst work/life balance ratios in an industry notorious for terrible work/life balance as it is. It is NOT a walk in the park, and you are assuming so much more responsibility and liability for negligent actions when you claim \"cybersecurity\".",

On top of that there were a ton of recruiters recruiting for colleges and other courses that were telling everyone how much money they'd make as long as they got a degree or some certifications through them.

On most job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) if you don’t know someone at the company that is hiring you have a nearly a 0% chance at getting even an interview.  A new job gets posted and within 2 hours more than 500 people submit an application.  From those everything is scanned by AI to find the top 5 candidates for an interview. Federal workers with 10+ years are being laid off and then are applying to 100 jobs over 8+ months before getting rehired.  Top analysts at major companies like Crowdstrike, big accounting and consulting firms are all being let go as nearly every company is restructuring positions and replacing many bodies with AI.",
