Assuming a normal distribution, that means you'll have 33,554,432 '1' or 'l'.\n\nYou then have to generate a new 'attempted file' for each 33,554,432 to cover each '1' or 'l'. That's a 2\\^n problem. 2\\^33554432 is....\n\n3.3x10\\^10,100,890\n\nYou have to run that many passes against the original 1GB - That's... a lot. Each pass is dirt cheap but the scaling's an issue. Simple problems to code and there's some clever things to improve the average time to hit (don't generate '1' and 'l' sequentially but randomly) but it's still a wild amount to crunch.\n\nOf course - that's assuming a multimedia, MASSIVE pdf. Assuming 1MB PDF, it's 1.4X10\\^9864. That's probably doable even on consumer hardware.\n\nWould be interesting for someone to benchmark it.\n\nAn LLM can make the code easily though:\n\n\"Generate python code to go through an array of characters, find all positions that are a '1' or an 'l', and then generate a an array of new arrays of characters, generating one new character array for each possible permutation of the original array where '1' and 'l' are replaced with either '1' or 'l'\n\nex. 'alcdl' + \\[1,4\\]\n\nOutput: alcdl, a1cdl, alcd1, a1cd1\"\n\nOf course that's the dumb version, you don't want to blow your memory up my storing all the intermediate attempt generations (you'd attempt a decode on the fly and break the loop if the API succeeded). And as mentioned you'd want to randomize the generation instead of keeping it linear. But, doable. Probably take an hour or two to hack together.",

I don’t expect that the network will produce an accurate classification of all l and 1’s but it does give us a place to start a search. Suppose that we use the network to spit out a list of only l/1’s with less than 60% classification certainty.

It's ability to generate vulnerabilities will close, but then maybe new categories of issues will be created (see: prompt injection, or MCP vulnerabilities.)\n\nWhat's a bigger risk to AI is whether or not the bubble bursts before any value is extracted by the organizations using it.\n\nIt won't go away post-collapse - there will just be fewer players and consolidation amongst IP - but that doesn't mean understanding the underlying technologies, their weaknesses, or how to secure them will be any less relevant in five years: which is where our industry steps in.\n\nAt the end of the day, organizations using computers and running software will have a role for us to play. I don't think there will be an inflection point where we can trust the AI to monitor the AI.\n\n-----\n\nEdit: deleted my other comment now that I'm at a computer and stuff.",

Drip-feed patches across M365 channels, leave Semi-Annual and deferred tenants exposed for weeks, then act shocked when APTs weaponize the diff. Click-to-Run fragmentation is a feature, not a bug yet it keeps enterprises paying while attackers feast on version skew.. lol\nTechnically speaking, this is the same old Office mess: RCE chains + MotW/Protected View bypasses, HTML/RTF abuse, preview-pane shenanigans, and legacy COM/MSDT attack surface that should’ve been ripped out years ago. “Recently patched” just means red teams already reversed it and threat actors are farming orgs that aren’t on Current Channel because downtime = money. Defender signatures don’t save you when the execution path is signed, trusted, and user-assisted by design.\nAnd yeah, it hits harder knowing this cash-printing monopoly happily takes government contracts while bankrolling and politically enabling genocide, then turns around and lectures customers about “shared responsibility.” Spare us. You can’t virtue-signal security while shipping a productivity suite that’s still one malformed document away from domain compromise.\nPatch fast, disable Office macros for real, enforce ASR rules, block child process spawning, and assume every Office file is hostile. Microsoft won’t fix the incentives — only admins cleaning up their mess will.\nDammn feels like i talked so much but would a thing be changed real soon? Not particularly no..",

The other piece is fostering an environment where your kids are comfortable coming to you when they are exposed to things or get in situations that make them uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, we need to teach basic things like \"don't click on everything you see\" as early as possible.",

My high school, when I attended, offered nearly a dozen relevant courses like Information Systems, programming 1-2, webdev, Computer Science (three types of AP courses), and had just started a cybersecurity course, and accounting 1-2 (taught me a lot that I use in cyber). \n\nNowadays I think they’ve expanded to offer an AP Cybersecurity course, a cryptography course, and a computer engineering course. Virginia (and Maryland) has a massive amount of resources for K-12 computing education. \n\nThat said, even within the state there are schools that just don’t have the money or personnel to offer classes like this. \n\nImo the path forward is to expand efforts by CISA to offer virtual coursework for students to learn cyber KSAs, and opportunities like Air Force Association’s Cyber Patriot and NSA Codebreaker to practice this.",

[https://youtu.be/1NrCeMiEHJM](https://youtu.be/1NrCeMiEHJM)\n\nI understand that things are moving quickly but in the words of Paul \"You don't get to leave a loaded ghost gun in a playground and walk away form all responsibility of what comes next\"",

It’s the AI-native equivalent of a trojan — clean README, malicious payload — except the “user” reviewing the skill is an LLM that’s been instructed to follow the instructions it reads. The agent doesn’t have a concept of “this file looks suspicious.” It has a concept of “I was told to use this skill and here are the instructions.”\n\nWhat makes this structurally worse than traditional supply chain attacks (npm, PyPI, etc.) is the permission model inversion. With a malicious npm package, the payload runs with whatever permissions the consuming application has, and in most deployments that’s scoped. With ClawHub skills, the payload runs inside an agent that likely already has filesystem access, shell execution, browser control, messaging credentials, and API keys. The skill doesn’t need to escalate privileges — it inherits them.\n\nAnd Peter’s “use your brain” response (deleted or not) reveals a fundamental architectural philosophy: security is the user’s responsibility, not the platform’s. That works when your users are security engineers. It doesn’t work when you have 149K GitHub stars and Codecademy is writing onboarding tutorials for beginners.\nWhat’s missing from OpenClaw — and what nobody in the ecosystem is really building yet — are the structural controls that make “use your brain” unnecessary:\n\n\t∙\tSkill allowlisting — nothing executes unless it’s on a vetted list, not a popularity-ranked marketplace\n\t∙\tStatic analysis gates — AST scanning for dangerous patterns (os.system, subprocess, eval, network calls) before a skill is ever eligible\n\t∙\tPer-agent budget ceilings — so even a compromised skill can’t run up unlimited API costs\n\t∙\tCryptographic signing — so you can verify a skill hasn’t been tampered with between publish and install\n\t∙\tAudit trails with layer enforcement traces — so you can forensically reconstruct what a skill actually did vs. what it claimed to do\n\nI’ve been building these as an open-source framework at SammaSuit.com — eight enforced security layers specifically designed around the gaps OpenClaw leaves open. The allowlist-based skill gating (what we call SANGHA) is the direct answer to the ClawHub trust problem: instead of “download what’s popular and hope it’s not malware,” it’s “nothing runs unless you’ve explicitly approved it.” Not a marketplace — a gate.\n\nJamieson and Paul are doing critical work surfacing these issues. The uncomfortable next step is building the infrastructure that makes the exploitation paths they’ve documented structurally impossible rather than just documented.",

A lot of you are saying that that this is „old news“ - but from my understanding the big difference to the December reporting is that it was no attack via DNS/ISP with enormous manual effort but rather the NPP hosting infrastructure compromised for quite a long time.\n\nAre people still assuming that the victims were selectively targeted? I find it quite likely that a second wave could’ve been much broader.\n\nI see the rapid7 report mentioned often but even they are writing in their first few paragraphs that they were not able to determine the initial scope of infrastructure compromise. And the incident report from the NPP developer is vague at best.\n\nWhat are your actual strategies right now? With the info at hand we are looking at a full reinstall of clients using notepad++.\n\nEDIT: Does someone know the old hosting provider used by notepad++? We have a lot of update routines identified via our xdr and knowing what „legitimate“ would be really helpful.",

However, the attackers managed to maintain access to internal services until December 2025.\n\nReports indicate that the threat actors continuously changed server addresses to distribute malicious updates. In one of the campaigns, the actors caused the victim to download a malicious `.exe` file, which turned out to be an NSIS installer of approximately 1 MB named “Chrysalis.” Upon execution, the actor uses `cmd` and `curl` to send system information to the attackers. Chrysalis is a backdoor that executes several files in `%appdata%\\ProShow`; one of these corresponds to legitimate ProShow software, which is used to run the final payload.\n\nThe payload contains two shellcodes. One of them includes junk code; however, the second retrieves Metasploit, which then downloads a Cobalt Strike beacon designed to establish a connection with the threat actor’s Command and Control (C&C) server.\n\nIn another campaign, the attackers added several commands to gather information from the victim’s machine, such as `whoami`, `tasklist`, `systeminfo`, and `netstat`. In general, the campaigns show slight variations, such as the URL used to download the Chrysalis backdoor, its size, and the paths where executables are stored. However, their objective remains the same: to obtain Metasploit and download the Cobalt Strike beacon.",

But once you have given yourself a little time, pick yourself up, brush yourself off, and get back out there. \n\nRemember the guys we're defending against have bad days too.

Mine was blanking on basic SIEM correlation concepts during a senior engineer interview - stuff I literally did every day. Nerves are real.\n\nTwo things worth considering:\n\n1. The fact that you are discouraged means you actually care, which puts you ahead of a lot of people who coast. That feeling sucks right now but it is fuel if you channel it right.\n\n2. Coding assessments in security interviews are a weird filter. Most security engineers I have worked with are not developers - they are problem solvers who can script when needed. If this role requires heavy development, it might not be the right fit, and that is okay. If they are just using it as a general filter, that is a sign the hiring process is broken, not that you are broken.\n\nPractical suggestion: take note of every question you stumbled on and spend the next two weeks filling those specific gaps. Not generic \"study more\" but targeted practice on exactly where you fell short. That turns a bad interview into a free assessment of what to work on next.\n\nFour years in this field is solid.

      "text": "Throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\nTLDR: we've had a lot of red teams performed against our org by third parties. Those performed by well-known US consultancies have been extremely poor quality. In contrast, we have recently finished up our first RT provided by a UK firm and the difference in quality was a chasm. Why is this the case and has anyone else noticed this.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nA quick bit about me: I'm a SOC manager at a large US financial, I have over a decade of experience in defense and have seen all sorts of interesting incidents. These days my role is all about skilling up our next generation of analysts, for which I heavily rely on Red Team engagements (adversary simulations, not pentests).\n\nTo get to the point, over the last 5 years we have had yearly Red Team engagements performed against us. I won't name names of who we've used (and I'm not part of the procurement process - for now....) but they have all been performed by well-known consultancies based in the US, with the exception of the most recent assessment which was a UK firm. We cycle through vendors so each assessment has been performed by different companies.\n\nEvery single one of the US Red Teams have failed miserably. I'd consider us a mature environment, we have to be, but I'm not naive enough to think we are inpenetrable. Having said that, I honestly don't understand how people are recommended these companies and constantly hyping them up as \"hardcore Red Teamers\". Some highlights over the years:\n\nFor example, on last years assessment they tried phishing users by sending a mass email campaign without any setup or social engineering. Just an email to 50 users with a link. Immediately got caught by our ESG. They then immediately went to assumed breach by requesting a laptop and vpn. They then did the entire assessment from the laptop without even attempting to get an implant running on it (and got caught the moment they tried to RDP to a host they shouldn't have). \n\nMost of the US teams we have used don't even bother with phishing, they almost always go straight to assumed breach, and regularly request exceptions made for their implants. It's so low effort I don't understand the point. All of them use completely out-dated techniques, which on its own isn't a bad thing, but they don't even try and adapt them to bypass signature based detections - like the team the year before who got caught using impacket without any alterations.\n\nIn contrast, the UK team we used (who I think are quite well known in those parts but maybe less so over here) were on a completely different level. They got in through a phishing campaign they had built up over 3 weeks of social engineering. Once inside they barely made any noise and reading the report it feels like every single tool they used was either completely custom or heavily adapted. We did detect them twice, but they had executed their techniques and built their payloads in such a way that they blended in with the environment and as a result both detections got marked FP. The whole engagement was eye opening, especially for our board who had a false sense of security from previous assessments.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm making this post. It might be out of frustration more than anything. I have seen post after post about how amazing X is, or how Y's team are the gold standard, and yet we have seen RTs done by all of these companies and to me they seem completely overhyped. Has anyone else had similar experiences? Does any from the UK (and maybe EU) understand why there is such a difference?\n\nFinal note: please don't ask about specific companies, you can guess all you want I won't answer. ",

Are there good companies there? Yes, but if you want to hire them a lot of management/compliance teams wants a big name who hires people with zero talent because the big name looks better for auditors.",

For one of our last engagements we didn’t need a full blown beacon, we only required a Socks proxy, which we then injected and persisted through a beign process. \n\nFinally, having beacons white listed is a debate among the red team community. Some teams (like ours) spend a lot of time in R&D to bypass EDR. However, imagine if this time was instead spent looking for problems in our corporate environment. It may some reduce the companies risk in the long run.

Let me tell you, in order to be a red teamer fit for the uk team there are so many hoops you have to jump through in order the UK team to remotely consider you a red teamer. You need to past two of the most difficult crest exams, with 5 years of experience doing red teaming/pentest already. Then you have to shadow red teaming engagements for at least 6-12 months, while they evaluate you. And then they might consider you a red teamer. It’s pretty involved. In the US, the red teamers I work with basically yolo. They rely on a lot of self studying, external training and some common sense to get through engagements. They rely a lot on people skills, as these engagements tend to require a lot of hand holding with the client. The other thing I will mentioned is that the UK has regulation requirements that require certain industries to be red teamed, not pentested, red teamed. And they have very specific requirements of what that looks like. ( and it doesn’t help that certain companies will market red teaming engagements as pentest). US has nothing that comes close to it. \n\nAlso as people have mentioned already, the market is simply not ready for this type of red teaming. Most companies just want a check in the box test so they can tell regulators and insurance companies that they have been tested. What is considered tested is unfortunately too broad and loose, for most company to consider red teaming, and I would boldly say a lot of them don’t have the security maturity for it.",

I personally consider this type of engagement to be more of a vulnerability test / confirmation than a pen test. I think management assumes this approach saves money and if it satisfies auditors then I think that’s all they care about.\n\nImagine assuming breach, giving pen testers a foothold, and then being surprised they got in; well no shit they got in, you let them in.

No we did not call it an MSP 25 years ago. It was just Business IT Support. \n\n1. Use the Pomodoro method: 25 mins work 5 min break. Trust me, it works:\n\nhttps://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique\n\n2. You’ll need to manage your RSD: every comment can be taken as a personal attack if you’re not careful. People are not complaining to you about you. They ‘re usually expressing frustration with the event. \n\n3. If you are not going to write it down in the moment, take a picture with your phone. Use that for when you get around to the documentation in the year 2099 or later this week when your boss asks about it. \n\n4. Give yourself time away from computers. You will need to have some sort of delineation between your work and your personal life. If you don’t do this, you’ll wake up in 25 years and realize that your personal and business life has merged into a single entity, never allowing you respite (not that I’m talking from personal experience here /s)\n\n5. ADHD skills that are highly useful: situational awareness, pattern recognition, squirrel. \n\n6. Your medical conditions are not Office news. Tell your direct report and infer with your team… chances are you’re on a Neuro spicy team to begin with so all is good. \n\n7. No matter how easy, never lie. Never misinform. This doesn’t mean you need to make your boss’s office a confession booth (sometimes STFU is the right move).\n\n8. . Don’t beat yourself up too much. It doesn’t do any good and it can ruin your enjoyment of life.",

          "text": "I have ADHD and I absolutely excel in Cybersecurity.\n\nHowever, I am very well aware of what I need, what I cannot handle well and what will be damaging to me and my ability to work.\n\nNonetheless, I can list some typical happenings which require some executive functions - and you can see for yourself if they would be problematic \n\nThe best thing I can recommend in the work context considering \"what helped me\" is being honest with yourself, being honest enough with bosses and colleagues and build external structures where your internal structures are lacking.\nThe best thing in general is regularly evaluating medication and coaching or behavioural therapy to deliver workplace specific skill/toolsets when you find yourself running out of ideas.\n\nCybersecurity aspects with heavy executive functioning:\n\n- Task and environment switching; many roles require you to shift gears fast and potentially often - even in tasks you switch from analysis, to documentation, to reaction, back to analysis, then to social exchange \n\n- Emotionally loaded interactions - people will tell you (in friendly words) you're stupid, overly cautious or similar. In any job they will often be annoyed when you want something. If you do anything around incidents stress is high, sometimes also other emotions\n\n- Time restrictions; time blindness can be problematic in the sense that timeframes for reactions or communications can be short/exist even when diving in, it can also get problematic because a lot of task run longer and still can't be forgotten or need checking in. The first is more typical in anything with incidents, the latter more with engineering or policies \n\n- Completion / following through: connects to task switching, but there often are lose ends to tie which are not NECESSARILY required anymore. (Which is why I personally like playbooks or templates with steps)\n\n- Task organisation: There is a lot of smaller things to do, things that need to be done regularly but not often, and tasks broken between different systems - keeping track can be hard\n\n- Memory is often relevant: working memory can be crucial when doing incidents, knowing where everything is written is relevant, knowing policies can be important, and often meetings will not have protocols but need to be taken in.\n\n- Planning and prioritisation are often central parts of tasks - more relevant the more one goes IR / direct reaction (I think) \n\n- Appointments - the more you mesh with other departments, the more often this will be relevant\n\n- Demanding work environment - a lot of work in Cybersecurity has a lot of demands or stress. As self-assessment can be hard with ADHD, risk of burnout or accepting bad environments for too long are very real. The work also often does not naturally allow break at clever times, but god damn especially ADHD needs them \n\n- Documentation requirements: documentation is way more boring then IR (or even architecture etc). It's very required. That can be hard.\n\n- Overload: adjacent to task organisation - often enough one has a lot of, sometimes really different, tasks in cybersecurity. Even if you know them all, it can be overwhelming to see them and lead to not starting any\n\n- Content planning / creation: god it can be so freaking hard to get your non-linear thinking to words which work for linear thinking colleagues (be it your team or people in other departments)\n\n- Noise: the exact kind of noise depends highly on your work place, but there are so many chances for it: alerts, too many tools, so so many mails, noisy office spaces due to e.g. others in meetings, visual noise with tooling. It's good to know what you can and cannot tolerate\n\n- having to step back: continuous necessity in so many jobs in Cybersecurity - but at the same time usually requires when nearly in the middle of the deep dive. That's hard.\n\n- Sometimes it can feel like \"it\" never ends: many cybersecurity jobs are continuous - and require parallel work on more than one thing. So even when you finish something, it can be hard to actually feel the accomplishment\n\n- Clearing up a setup, technical debt etc needs to happen \"in between\". Similar to tidying up at home - similarly potentially difficult",

Every day, I make/have a quick breakfast and make myself a cup of pour over coffee. It may not sound like a lot, but having a routine can really help with starting your day off right.\n\nAnother example, I write a physical list of tasks that I need to work daily.

          "text": "Yep, it's fantastic.\n\nHonestly, executive disfunction is rarely a problem because I've got so much to hold my attention.  Not only that but I often see things other people don't and I can keep multiple trains of thought going at the same time, so long as they're related to the thing I'm currently working on, it's like my brain is automatically tracing the path through 50 different mazes at the same time when I'm trying to solve a problem.\n\nHowever, if you don't have strong leadership with clear direction, it can be extremely easy to fall into task paralysis.   If there's a clear problem that needs solving, i.e an incident, or a complex problem, I can literally spend my whole shift glued to my screen, completing work that takes most other people days to work through.\n\nI think the most critical thing that has made my work life infinitely easier is a simple notepad and pen.   I've got the left page intentionally blank for random notes, shit I need to jot down so I don't forget but has no direct relation to clearly defined tasks, followups I need to do that have ambiguous actions required etc, then the right page is always ruled, dated, and has the SPECIFIC tasks I need to complete for that day, along with any notes from meetings or instructions/guidance given.   That way I'm always able to refer back to a specific day and know exactly what happened and the context in which it was in, and at the end of each week, I flick through the last few pages over notes which cements it all in my long term memory.\n\nI strongly advise against using note taking APPs, because it's digital it's very easy as someone with ADHD to just forget it's there, a physical notepad doesn't have that problem, it's always in eyesight, and you have to physically manipulate it to do anything with it (which helps build more neural connections to solidify the memory).  But one type of app I will recommend that many companies use anyway, is some form of task board like [monday.com](http://monday.com) or Jira.  The main advantage of this is being able to copy paste important information, conversations, screenshots, URLs, hyperlink relevant documents, and share that information easily with others.",

During my initial interview for a job as a pentester, I had brought up my documentation method for every job I was applying to, the OSINT I would perform on each company to better understand them, and a timeline showing when any communication took place, regardless if it was from me or from them. I did this more for my benefit to better gauge my interactions with the organizations I was applying to and would then find myself not following back up on, holding myself accountable and also being able to recall hope I was treated by those organizations in the past. I offered to show the interviewer an example of what I did on them and they were incredibly impressed with it enough to ask if he could get a screenshot of it to share with the others.\n\nI've been with the company just a little over a year now and I can say it's been the skill that I benefit the most from. Being able to document things well and then translate that documentation into a report is so much more critical than your technical skills. If you can't convey what you did, the client either won't take what you're saying seriously or think you didn't do anything. Good documentation ensures that you can deliver on that. Technical skills can always be taught later with enough time and effort, assuming you're sufficiently motivated to learn.\n\nFor context to this, I spent a year and a half before I got this position trying to pivot from IT as a systems admin to information security as a pentester. My timing was terrible because just when I realized where my skillset made the most sense for my career, everyone and their grandmother had also bought into the hype about following in all those roles the cybersecurity industry was allegedly being to fill so badly. I was effectively competing with a flood of new college kids, which no doubt got me lost in the noise of so many applicants in a role that's already pretty saturated.",

That role dealt with security for technologies that I worked with for the rest of my career, plus degree and certs were in that field. So if you want cloud security, if you can get a cloud admin (or something that applies, say, AWS Cloud Practitioner, etc. skills) and then pivot to cloud security, that's the equivalent to what I did.\n\nMy current job, at first I wanted to say I have no idea what made me stand out, but I do have some similar tasks to what my previous role had, so that's probably it. I had time to do some studying during my search and I was enthusiastic about learning the tools we're using. I was working on a cert and didn't finish it by the time I got my offer, but I did take a class last year and I found that was responded positively to in interviews.",

In reality, those call backs are few and far between these days so I highly recommend finding somewhere or some people to practice with so you can make the nost of the callbacks you do get. Look online for interview workshops in your area or online. Take notes when you come across a new question that trips you up. \n\n\nNo amount of interview prep is going to help if you can't speak the language of networking and security so you gotta have your fundamentals down. This part is a lifelong journey though.\n\n\nAnd lets not forget a fair amount of luck.\n\n\nYou're right this sub like to wallow in doom and gloom... for good reason. But you've only lost when you've given up so keep at it, everyday. Make it your job. And make yourself ready when the opportunity comes.",

You aren't, its business first, operational IT second, then Security. We are an enablement grease and a pretty wrapper and bow. \n\nI know thats not encouraging for those without experience but you just have to start at the best place you can and work up.

          "text": "\"Cybersecurity experts usually advise victims against paying ransomware crooks, but that advice goes double for those who have been targeted by the Nitrogen group. There's no way to get your data back from them!\n\nAccording to Coveware, which peered under the hood of Nitrogen's ransomware program, a programming error prevents the gang's decryptor from recovering victims' files, so paying up is futile.\n\nThe finding specifically concerns the group's malware that targets VMware ESXi. Coveware said that the program encrypts files with the wrong public key, making it impossible for the criminals to decrypt them, even if the victim pays for a decryption tool.\n\nNitrogen's malware makes the error of loading a new variable, a QWORD, into memory so that it overlaps with the public key.\n\nBecause the malware loads the public key at offset rsp+0x20 and the 8-byte QWORD at rsp+0x1c, it overwrites the first four bytes of the public key, meaning that an attacker-supplied decryptor would fail.\n\n\"Normally, when a public-private Curve25519 keypair is generated, the private key is generated first, and then the public key is derived subsequently based on the private key,\" Coveware said.\n\n\"The resulting corrupted public key wasn't generated based on a private key, it was generated by mistakenly overwriting a few bytes of another public key. The final outcome is that no one actually knows the private key that goes with the corrupted public key.\"\n\nNitrogen has been around since 2023. According to Coveware, it began as one of the various offshoots that borrowed code from the leaked Conti 2 builder.\n\nBarracuda Networks previously reported that it evolved into a ransomware group slowly over time. It first developed malware to facilitate initial access for others, although its operators didn't work as initial access brokers, but began extorting organizations in or around September 2024.\n\nWhile it is not one of the most prolific groups in operation, it is also not to be underestimated.\n\nEven with this latest finding, which will go down alongside other epic own goals by ransomware gangs, it's hard to see the funny side with this one.\n\nThe coding error takes this financially-motivated ransomware gang into the realm of pure destruction, where both parties walk away losers.\"",
