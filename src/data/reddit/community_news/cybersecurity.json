Also, doesn't sound like there's going to be any formal seating, so have fun holding your laptop up while you're standing in a crowd. \n\nMy real answer: they probably don't want any amateurs being disruptive with electronic devices there that they can't track down. Normal cell phones can be tracked and identified. They could never stop an actual attacker with proper covert gear, but they can stop a bunch of children from DoS'ing equipment and being annoying.",

The political atmosphere around this election was charged to say the least, and it stands to reason that Mamdani’s inauguration could be a more interesting target for disruption than others. From the perspective of a naïve event coordinator, banning devices like F0 takes little effort and appears to have the effect of removing a large amount of possible disruptions, regardless of the reality that almost no one in any random crowd of 10,000 would ever have such a device with them. Unfortunately, like you said, it also doesn’t stop someone with actual ill intent.",

E.g., while you might run a little home lab or mini K8s server at home on your RPi, there's very few reasons you would need to bring a RPi with you into a convention center for a political event.",

Maybe the military is too efficient to be able to declare martial law.\n\nGreenland and the Praxis Project for POTUS'es billionaire buddies is next. Not for actual mining or defense reasons, but as a 0% tax haven. Gotta protect your assets for what comes after 2 years, right? Especially with all that sweet oil money coming in from Venezuela now.\n\n(also wanted to mention that the administration went super silent for Cayman island offshore companies since they got into power.

After doing that, I don’t see how this is being framed as “crippling” U.S. cyber defense.\n\nOur cyber defenses have never come from the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise or the Global Counterterrorism Forum. Those are policy and capacity-building forums, not operational defense bodies. They don’t provide sensors, threat intelligence feeds, incident response, or active defense. They don’t hunt adversaries, attribute attacks, or stop intrusions.\n\nU.S. cyber defense is rooted in NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, CISA, the FBI Cyber Division, Five Eyes intelligence sharing, bilateral agreements with allies, and massive private-sector telemetry from companies like Microsoft, CrowdStrike, and Mandiant. None of that goes away because we leave a multilateral policy forum.\n\nThere’s a fair debate to be had about diplomacy and influence, but saying this “opens us up to cyberattack” or that it proves someone is a foreign asset is a stretch that doesn’t match how cyber defense actually works. If leaving these forums truly crippled us, we’d have to believe they were quietly doing the core work of U.S. cyber defense — and they simply weren’t.\n\nDisagree with the policy if you want, but let’s keep the criticism grounded in reality instead of treating non-operational forums like they were the backbone of national cyber security",

It's often easier to simply walk into substations and destroy some capacitors.\n\nI've traditionally interpreted claims like this more as a PR stunt to sow FUD. It is theoretically possible, but low probability and likely not the most effective tool at your disposal if you're actually seeking to cause a blackout. What if the cyber attack had failed? Why not use the military to walk in and trigger the isolators, or blow it up? Kinetic options were definitely on the table here!",

In the past we have closed AMAs that are just 100% advertising with no discussion. \n\nChris hasn’t made a moderation decision in about four years but due to how Reddit manages moderator hierarchy he is stuck at the top of the queue because his account is still active.\n\nThe moderation team is mostly American, but so is the user base. I’m Australian. We specifically recruited at the end of the last year to bring on new moderators based in Europe and Asia.",

          "text": "There's a few posts recently here that are misleading framing to make things sound like the end of the world in the Cyber Security space. This is not true and framing like it is shows both a lack of understanding and devalues the legitimate concerns by association.\n\n* 899 people is a shutdown posture, there is no evidence to show that this is a permanent headcount.\n* The Cyber Safety Review board was disbanded, that's a transparency/learning-loss problem not the removal of day to day defensive operations.\n* the Cyber Info Sharing Act's protections lapsed in October of 2025, and were extended only temporarily to the end of this month. While from the outside that could chill voluntary sharing at the margins, it doesn't \"sever\" all government - industry coordination. In fact most transpires outside of these working groups. If you don't believe me, ask anyone that attended the Industry TTX (Chain Breaker) exercise how that went and what the situations were before and after.\n* Some states have claims that election security support they rely on has been cut, but that doesn't equate to \"No cyber defenses\" also it's largely the responsibility for each state to ensure cyber resiliency through many different means (including NSA / FBI relationships).\n\nNow the better approach would have been to preface it like this \"How do recent changes affect the warning to action cycle?\" There's a lot of organizations including ISACs that largely just push the same data around in circles and aren't very effective.\n\nThe private sector will continue to lead the charge. Key players like Microsoft, Amazon, Cloudflare, Crowdstrike, etc will continue to leverage their relationships within the government to enable a better security posture for the US and for the Globe.\n\nI will also add that there are still great people at CISA working just as hard as the have in the past, focused on enabling these relationships as well. We're not screwed in any way shape or form, we're just optimizing. \n\n\\-----\n\nHere's a great response from Chat GPT on all of this, I would concur.\n\n\"NSA, FBI, and CISA are still largely effective at what they do within their respective lanes: NSA and the Intelligence Community continue to generate foreign-intelligence-driven insight and technical guidance; FBI remains the lead for investigations, disruption, and prosecution; and CISA still sets civilian defensive priorities (e.g., KEV-driven patch urgency) and coordinates incident response and sector engagement—even if reduced resourcing can slow throughput and outreach. But it’s also important to be clear-eyed about where “cyber defense” actually happens day to day: the largest portion of prevention, detection, and recovery is executed by private-sector owners and operators and their security vendors (SOCs, MSSPs, EDR providers, cloud platforms, ISACs, insurers, and incident response firms). Federal agencies can sharpen prioritization, share intelligence, and help coordinate response, but they don’t run most enterprise networks—and they never have—so the nation’s baseline cyber resilience is fundamentally driven by private-sector posture and operational discipline, with the government acting as an enabling and backstopping layer rather than the primary security provider.\"",

You can't have two smart people working on an issue without a manager.  And those two people will probably need a project manager to keep them on target because the manager needs to meet with other managers.  And then you need an admin to facilitate emails between the manager, the PM, the techs, and anyone else.  And then you need an IT person to keep those systems everyone is using alive.  All this happens, and even though there are staff assigned to another group that are doing something similar, because they don't work for your group you can't/won't use them, even if they have plenty of cycles available to do what needs to be done, because they don't report to the one manager and therefore there is no accountability.\n\nThis also happens in large corporations and is why the occasional RIF is required.  I worked at a company where 5 people were dedicated, full time, to making sure that 5 cables were lit.  I've seen where 6 people were staffed 24/7/5 to send stats..and I wrote a quick program that did all of it within 30 minutes and was told to shelve my program and shut up about it.",

      "text": "I've spent the last decade in incident response, working across everything from 5-person joinery shops to multi-national retail enterprises. After cleaning up roughly 1,000 incidents, I naturally developed a bit of an intuition for knowing the difference between \"good security\" and \"good control coverage\".\n\nThe firms that survive incidents (and prevent them) are almost never the ones with the most tools or the biggest budgets. They were the ones who understood their resilience - where they'd actually break under pressure, and what that would cost them.\n\nA few things I've learned that changed how I approach assessments:\n\n**1. Compliance framing creates false confidence**\n\nCyber Essentials, SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc - you must understand that their sole purpose is to make it easier to do business with other companies. Executives sponsor these programmes because it will make them more money.\n\nThat might be by making their onboarding quicker, or shortening deal cycles when responding to RFPs, or just increasing consumer confidence.\n\nNone of it actually helps an organisation be more secure. At the best, I think it's fair to say that there's a small correlation between certifications and resilience, but it's absolutely not a casual relationship, just a pattern.\n\n**2. Clients respond to money, not maturity scores**\n\nNobody outside of security knows what \"Level 3 maturity\" means. But say \"you have a high insolvency risk from a major incident\" and suddenly you've got board-level attention. I frame all my assessments this way, even for small businesses.\n\nThe key principle to consider is that security programmes cost money. And for any commercial venture, money MUST provide a return on investment. If your recommendations don't make your client more money then they cost, why would they do it? I've known many enterprises that simply accept that they will have a major incident every 1-2 years, because the cost of transforming their security architecture would cost more than the impact of the incidents.\n\nThis is a totally valid position! And if you can help your client weigh up exactly what the pros and cons are, then you will quickly become one of their most trusted and valuable partners.\n\nThe trick, of course, is having the data and vocabulary to model the commercial implications.\n\n**3. The \"time to low risk\" metric changes the conversation**\n\nExecutive audiences don't understand CVSS scores, and are not going to read your 47 technical findings. Include them for context and for technical readers, but stick them in an appendix, and instead, lead with the programme required to get from their current state into an acceptable state.\n\nHow many months will it take? How much will it cost? Who will do the work? How do they measure success?\n\nThis completely changes the conversation, and transforms a scary report into an actionable project plan that your client will have confidence in sponsoring. You want your client to feel like they've been handed a solution, not a problem.\n\n**4. Periphery systems are where organisations actually die**\n\nCore infrastructure is usually fine - everyone's got M365, EDR, and MFA on their main systems now. If they've put one iota of effort into changing the defaults or have an MSP that does this for them, by and large they are in a great position.\n\nThe reason organisations like this still get hacked is because of the exceptions. Machines that don't have DfE on. Servers that have been missed from your asset register. An SSL VPN that no-one knew about.\n\nFixing these are often quick wins. Migrating might be a pain, but it's ultimately a short programme of work with a high reduction in risk.\n\n\\----\n\nI've put together a sample report that captures everything I've discussed above with a fictitious client. Here's the link: [https://analystengine.io/msp-assessment-sample](https://analystengine.io/msp-assessment-sample)\n\n**Transparent disclosure:** The site above does link to my cybersecurity startup focused on generating content like the above. That being said, the link above contains no CTA or sales material. I'm making the sample freely available as a resource for others to use how they see fit - and have added the required corporate flair to this post.\n\nI would love any advice or feedback on the report structure if anyone has thoughts on how to improve it!\n\n\\----\n\nEDIT: Overwhelmed with all the support this post got! For those asking for follow-up materials and my playbook for delivering cybersecurity assessments, I've typed it all up here: [How to deliver cybersecurity assessments](https://www.analystengine.io/how-to-deliver-cybersecurity-assessments?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=cybersecurity)\n\nI've included lots of resources, including the sample questionnaire I use for all new engagements, and a checklist of items to go through during your technical interviews. Good luck with your engagements!",

Some enterprises really want to be more secure, in which case GRC efforts provide a roadmap and a yardstick for measuring progress. What most enterprises wish for, however, is a checkmark as a sales qualification, so they can sell into specific markets where security is a concern. For example, I can't tell you how many companies might say, \"We'll buy from you, but you need your SOC 2\" for enterprises where a SOC 2 isn't even appropriate, or they don't understand the difference between a SOC 2 Type I and II. Still, they will take a well-documented list of security controls over adequate security.",

If it is for SMB, then stuff like software developent will most likely not be an item. I like the control assessment, compliance (if it applies), and findings section. But idk.. on the whole it seems very long and too wordy. In my experience SMB dont have the attention span for most of this stuff. Great as a deliverable if your trying to demonstrate value with a very long document, but how useful is it is what I always ask myself. How does any of this translate to the client to take action on? Feel free to disagree, but thats just my initial take.",

Most of the time the SMB is just the owner that doesnt really know what to do, so they hire the MSP to do this stuff. So, if the context is that you are the MSP doing a security evaluation, then a lot of this seems kinda unnecessary. Like, you are reporting to the owner on your own security work, etc. - and that could be drastically summarized in my opinion.   \nOtherwise, I'd ask who is this meant for? An IT manager, the owner? or the MSP if you are just the external security evaluator/auditor?    \nWhat is the high level overview of the findings, and some details on each category evaluated - then maybe some technical stuff to help guide whoever might actually implement changes/fixes.

I can tell you what services you provide and how they compare to what your competitors are doing. But risk is not addressed by NIST CSF.\n\nClient: So what have I paid for then?!\n\nThe security domains I've included in this sample (SecOps, Resilience, Growth) are all aligned/mapped to NIST in the backend. But especially for the SMB audience where the buyer is a little less mature, I think it's important we can go beyond service maturity and actually present improvement roadmaps aligned to risk - because really that's what they care about.\n\nPeople may disagree on that, and that's fair.

If it doesn't do that, this is how you get your budgets slashed and see a service regression.\n\nEven in organisations that have board-level CISO representation, your CEO and CFO are still critical stakeholders. And if you tell them that 2-3 incidents a year costs the company $5 and an investment of $10 would reduce that annual cost to $2... there's a strong argument for them to say \"Let's wait a few years\".  \n  \nAll I am really saying is you will get more achieved and further your agenda better if you work within this way of thinking.

          "text": "Interesting post, says a lot of truisms but I’m not sure some of this is practical, I’ve got two comments: \n\n**Firstly on “talking money” in incident reports**\n\n> say “you have a high insolvency risk from a major incident” and suddenly you’ve got board-level attention. I frame all my assessments this way, even for small businesses.\n\n> The trick, of course, is having the data and vocabulary to model the commercial implications.\n\nYes, of course, dollar figures can raise urgency; but you talk about “modelling” risk in financial terms. Anyone who’s been through this exercise knows it’s an exercise in choosing which variables to multiply together. Very Often, in practice, best case is $0 and worst case is the sky has fallen. \n\nDay to day does this boil down to maturing finding severity ratings + canned copy in the report? \n\nIn my experience this requires more restraint be exercised than vocabulary. Very easy to scaremonger and kick up urgency. Not so easy to scale (aka show true granular relative risk and help the business to prioritise over time). \n\nLong story short: Talking “insolvency” or business outcomes with execs who (should) know 100x more than you about the business is a minefield, don’t you think? \n\n**secondly: on providing rich, end to end remediation plans to the business** \n\nThe “time to low risk” metric as you call it. Another no brainer: yes execs would love this - but how do you do it at scale? \n\nAs you describe incidents are rarely simple and can have many compound causes. \n\nYou have, say, 30 findings. Just to make up an example, they’re across: Appsec issues flagged by sast (plus some old ancillary risk for good measure), container rehydration issues with several modules, EOL components in use, legacy internally developed library dependencies flagged by sca, architecture review shows some red flags, auth is not blueprint standard but risk is unclear, an api not discovered by inventory, and to top it off external risk rating agencies are starting to ding you. (Now, your post talks about IR, but your template talks about general risk posture assessment. If it’s the latter I’ve kept things very very simple in this example). \n\nYou ask all the questions, like it’s a lack of business consideration that causes security to not hand this information over: \n\n> How many months will it take? How much will it cost? Who will do the work? How do they measure success?\n\nBut how do you, as cyber, answer them systematically before even issuing a report? Is that even possible for nontrivial orgs you are not embedded in (I mean, I’m sure there’s some people much smarter than me who could infer a tonne and get pretty far - but I assume this template is for the average responder?) \n\nAre just just giving generic canned solutions/plans to symptoms of generic problems? In which case the “actionable plan” sales pitch is a bit overhyped. \n\nAt scale: Answering these questions - actually answering them - is more work than responding to the incident in the first place. Much more work. Often it is also work that security absolutely cannot do in isolation - so you find yourself needing buy in from business long before you can give them these answers with any confidence at all. \n\nObviously an end to end project plan would be easier to action but if it was as simple as just doing that, it would be the default already.\n\n> You want your client to feel like they’ve been handed a solution, not a problem.\n\nYes obviously but the reason IR doesn’t hand the business fully fledged solutions on a silver platter are, in short, doing so scales very slowly and comes with many built in challenges.",

When we're dealing with security assessments, we only have several finite tools with which to deal with assessments of any kind.\n\n\\- We can look at control effectiveness  \n\\- We can look at service maturity  \n\\- We can look at governance  \n\\- We can look at risk\n\nEach of these domains is highly specalised, and with mature buyers like enterprises, they will almost always be very separate engagements with different stakeholders.\n\nBut for smaller organisations, it's impractical. So instead you have to squish multiple concepts together - because ultimately, what we want to do is best advise the organisation and ensure their business has strong margins (not weighed down by unnecessary cybersecurity cost centres) and can remain functional even if a disaster happened with their technology. That's the quintessence of our job.\n\nI accept basically all your points, I guess my only response is that we still have to do SOMETHING, and this is probably one of the best things you can do with the budget, resourcing, and buyer requirements that we most often have,",

SSL VPNs have seen some of the most 0day vulnerabilities on record, and these issues simply have not affected IPSEC implementations. \n\nHowever - in all the cases I’m aware of, adding MFA to the SSL VPN has been a mitigating measure. The vulnerabilities have only affected standard accounts with no second factor. This makes sense of course because your second factor will always involve a non-SSL identity component that’s much harder to spoof or break. \n\nThis means that the cheapest and most effective thing a client can do is just add MFA. Removing the implementation completely is a huge project and highly disruptive to working practices that are already comfortable with the current process. \n\nIn principle, I agree that IPSEC is the more secure implementation out of the two. But it doesn’t mean it’s the best advice to give a client if they’re stuck with an alternative solution.",

The disparity here is genuinely insane. I remember back in 2023 when I asked a prof at NUS about the sysadmin cyber janitor grind to break into cybersec and he, I shit you not, genuinely laughed at me.

Certificates I've never really needed, but I am also in the more narrowly focused side of the house (AppSec) and being a Software Engineer was the most important thing.   \n  \n> It should be illegal to post junior job positions while asking for mid or senior level skills.  \n  \nCybersecurity isn't an entry level industry, I'm sorry people advertised it as such. I assume it was some blogger or YouTuber chasing clicks and sales for their Udemy course to pass a bullshit certification.",

          "text": "Hands-on experience as in, years of working in a related field such as Helpdesk, then SysAdmin/Networking? If not, that's where you should be starting. This is not entry-level work and someone with a degree and internship without industry experience is still entry-level in this world. It sucks because other fields are not like this, but the reality is labs cannot prepare you for real environments because they are wildly different and vary so much from employer to employer. Without seeing that first-hand, it's probably hard to picture because you put in all this effort and did come out with meaningful knowledge. Not taking any of that away, it's hard work to get to where you're at now and helpdesk or adjacent non-security work seems like a step in the wrong direction, but I assure you it's not. Some people are lucky enough to get SOC work to start out and if you can catch up and learn the context of those alerts without having the support experience, I'm all for it. I hired and trained some of these people for my own SOC company and some worked out really well, while others would likely benefit from a more solid foundation.\n\nI started my career at Geek Squad, so not even helpdesk. Then helpdesk for a few years. Then software dev for a few years where I also handled all my infra/devops/admin of said infra - part of that time for an anti-virus company. Then blue team for a few years also doing regular sysadmin work. Then pentesting for a few years. Then Director for a few years. Then CIO and co-founder/CIO for a few years. Currently an IC Security Administrator for a tech company.\n\nI cannot explain enough how important every aspect of my career has been in my current job. I am constantly expected to have deep knowledge of the systems that I am securing when working with other teams, and if I didn't, I'd be much less effective and likely lose political capital from other teams. That's not the case for every position in this field, but it's where I am today and it will be expected at more than you think, depending on what size companies you are expecting to work at. Larger ones will have more clearly defined roles, but for smaller and mid-sized companies, you will be expected to be a lot more flexible.\n\nToday's market sucks even for people at my level. With competition at your level being as fierce as it is, I could not imagine being in your position trying to start out. It's gotta be really tough and disheartening seeing comments like mine, which work more to solidify your assumptions that this is a very hard field to get into. Adding onto that, when you are looking for these adjacent roles, people are paying attention to your degree and experience and know full well that you aren't planning to stay unless there's a clear path to pivot to security internally, so that makes it even harder in many cases. Hiring someone is an investment and when people think you'll be gone inside of a year for a better opportunity, they're less likely to move forward. \n\nI wish I had some better advice or something more to add, but the bottom line is the market sucks right now and it's tough out there with so many people trying to get into the same field. Opening up a role that has decent pay and is remote gets a mind-boggling number of applications in a few short hours, and there are a lot of very solid candidates in that pile. It seems to me more and more, and I am basing this off of my own decision-making when it comes to hiring, you need some level of hands-on at a company to compete these days because you are competing against people who have what you do as well as that foundation in a lot of cases. Recent grads are in a very tough spot at the moment.\n\nOne piece of advice I will give to everyone looking to get into this field: network with others in the industry. Not on like LinkedIn, build actual relationships, make friends. There are a lot of great communities, I tend to like Discord for this more than anything these days, but Twitter and forums used to be where we did this before. If you have a recommendation from an internal employee, it's almost guaranteed that your resume will be at least looked at. The reality of that is if you can impress people after getting in the room with them for an interview, you may bypass some requirements that filter out other candidates. That's probably the best way to have mobility across the spectrum of experience right now, IMO. That said, it's no guarantee. I've had a few cases where I had recommendations and still wasn't what they were looking for, so it's not a silver bullet but it helps massively.",

A GitHub? any evidence of pushing into the field on your own without just being handed an occasional HTB lab?\n\nDo you use recruiters?\n\nI'm from UK and sometimes maybe don't appreciate the US job market, but I've hired and hire a lot of people and some of the CV red-flags aren't perhaps what you expect.\n\nIn my experience, (and I've only hired offensive security people/pentesters/etc.) it's hard to find good candidates. The other side of the coin is that I think a lot of people wanting employment in security are in it because \"it's a good, in vogue, career with good pay\" (which is fine, depending on context) and way way way too many know basically nothing and haven't really put any real work into getting good at the thing they're looking to get paid baller money for.\n\nWhile my tone does seem critical, it's not directed at you, it's mostly playing devil's advocate. I have found a lot of difficulty finding good people. It's also very annoying when there are people in roles who are part-timers, or slack, when there are so many very hungry people that would near on kill for similar opportunities.\n\nI'd say if you really are into cybersecurity, just start doing stuff and getting a job will become easier. I'd offer advice on how to proceed, but you've not indicated where in Security you want to direct your attention. (If you say GRC, I'm out, though I'm afraid)",

Yes, there are Security roles in companies large and small and some companies have HUGE CS teams, but that might not be the case everywhere.\n\nThe Educational industry has successfully marketed and sold the “Cyber Security” degree, both bachelors and masters degrees and people spent big money on these degrees with the promise of $150k per year jobs lining up at graduation. This happens every enrollment season and no one ever asks “how many graduating students are you placing and what companies are hiring from this school?” In most cases, the answer will be zero. Zero companies are going to be waiting to hire a graduate of these programs. I see many candidates with basic and outdated CS degrees (yes, they are outdated) that may help build a foundation, but no real modern technologies included in that education. What we need to see are the people that understand IT, in large, medium and small business. They need to understand that business has to work before security, security personnel need to understand how to adapt security to make business work as well.\n\nYou need experience. Experience coding, experience in networking- building and maintaining these networks too, experience in support, project management, budgeting, security domains and standards. You need to understand the market today and the market 10 years ago to recognize the new and legacy technology.\n\nIt’s unfortunate that these degrees are being sold (for so much $$$$$ too) and there is no promise of success for making this investment.",

We have lost the internet, let’s be honest,” De Bruycker said. “If I want my information 100 per cent in the EU . . . keep on dreaming,” he added. “You’re setting an objective that is not realistic.”\n\nThe Belgian official warned that Europe’s [cyber defences](https://archive.ph/o/Z27fR/https://www.ft.com/cyber-security) depended on the co-operation of private companies, most of which are American. “In cyber space, everything is commercial. Everything is privately owned,” he said.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nEurope needed to build its own capabilities to strengthen innovation and security, said De Bruycker, adding that legislation such as the EU’s AI Act, which regulates the development of the fast-developing technology, was “blocking” innovation.\n\nHe suggested that EU governments should support private initiatives to build scale in areas such as cloud computing or digital identification technologies.\n\nIt could be similar to when European countries jointly set up the planemaker Airbus, he said: “Everybody was supporting the Airbus initiatives decades ago. We need the same initiative on \\[an\\] EU level in the cyber domain.”",

And they act to maintain the US owned walled gardens by preventing adversarial interoperability. Any real digital sovereignty seems impossible until we end these anti-circumvention laws.\n\nAcross the world, anti-circumvention laws could usually just be repealed at the national level, although some EU rules push them too, and must be repealed.\n\nEurope's only companies who profit from anti-circumvention laws should be treated as organized crime rings : Volkswagen and other car companies, who kill thouands via the diesel gate; Medtronic, whose vender lock-ins killed people by bricking ventilators during covid, Newag, whose vender lock-in makes repairing trains expensive and difficult.\n\n\\> *The Belgian official warned that Europe’s cyber defences depended on the co-operation of private companies, most of which are American.*\n\nYou cannot really buy \"cyber defence\" from any foreign company, not closed source tool anyways.  Instead, you need to take cyber defence seriously yourselfs, which firstly means making data unobtainable, either through encryption or through destruction.  \n\nEurope had a sane-ish first step under GDPR, but now they have started doing the opposite via [Chat Control](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1nb2hnr/perceptual_hashing/) and [data retention](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1pkq6qy/eu_revives_plan_for_yearlong_data_retention/).   European nations even hires foreign companies for wiretapping like Palantir and Huawei, meanwhile the FBI now endorses end-to-end encryption like Signal because they discovered they'd never remove Chinese spies from [their CALEA mandated wiretapping infrastructure](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/calea-was-a-national-security-disaster-waiting-to-happen)\n\nIn fact, Europe's idiot leaders signed the [UN cybercrime convention](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Unlimited-Evidence-Gathering-EU-Ratifies-Controversial-UN-Cybercrime-Convention-10752328.html) which effectively promises to criminalize developing \"cyber defence\" (hint: It's written by Russia).",

Scraping isn't a breach, because that info is already public, there's no expectation of privacy from anyone. Probably counts as API use that is against the ToS, but that's not a breach event. \n\nBC even notes in the article that \"Instead, the information suggests the data may be a compilation of previously scraped information from multiple sources over several years.\"\n\nThe password reset issue was definitely an incident - and needs to be investigated (which it appears they're doing now).

Would you have preferred to do anything different?\n\n2) do you have a strategy for splitting your team's time on actual IR work, forensics, report writing and responding to clients who are demanding updates every few minutes?\n\n3) the stories I've heard from incident responders is that they get burnt out and develop mental health issues, after years of being on call and undergoing repeated intense periods of stress. How do you keep yourself and your team from burning out?\n\n4) when you first get thrown into the chaos of an attack investigation, what are your usual steps for getting a sense of what's happening?\n\n5) what are the unique observations during an investigation that made you go \"woah guys come and look at this finding!\"\n\n6) how do you deal with having to learn so much, in so little time across different investigations? Like, one day it would be DNS hijacking across the world, then a vendor's hardware that's compromised in a supply chain attack, then hundreds of devices infected with ransomeware, then a customer's kubernetes cluster is infected. It always amazes me how IR teams can do this.\n\n7) Do you have a strategy for your team on keeping track of previous investigations and revisiting that information during new incidents?\n\n8) I've personally experienced first hand, incident investigators being treated in a hostile and unhelpful manner from clients who engaged them. Do you have similar stories about these kinds of behaviours and tips on how to overcome this?\n\n9) any stories on investigations where you just went \"sigh, this really isn't worth my/my team's time\"?",

As otherwise it couldn’t function. But that kind of thing tends to require serious consideration for RMM script execution, as they write the scripts onto disk ad-hoc (hopefully they handle signed scripts correctly).\n\nBut don't exclude RMM tools from on-access or behavioural scanning of your EDR, that'd be silly. Supply chain compromises can and do happen, and allow listing directories that the RMM resides within is a really good way to be compromised. If you allow-list the individual hashes of the program, that would be extra work every time there's an agent update, and also means RMM script execution likely would not be possible to exclude by hash or signature alone.\n\nAnd then from the attacker perspective, if I want somewhere to execute further code without anyone stopping me, I would enumerate all installed programs and look up their documented paths the vendor recommends be excluded from EDR. If whoever admins those systems has added those exclusions, surely one of those directories is a perfect place for a persistent backdoor.",

That feels like something worth capturing more intentionally.\n\nI chatted with Info-Raptor via DM, and he is open to collaborating on pulling together a resource of how practitioners stay current in cybersecurity. This would not be vendor-driven, just real-world habits and resources from folks doing the work.\n\nRather than reinventing the wheel or turning this into a promo, I would love to keep it simple.\n\nIf you are willing, drop a message at the [http://www.cyops.com.au/](http://www.cyops.com.au/) covering:\n\n* Your fav way to stay current (on-the-job learning, specific podcasts, blogs, newsletters, books, conferences, etc.)\n* Why this method works well for you\n* Who you think it is most useful for\n* Anything you wish you had found earlier in your career\n\nIf there is enough interest, the goal would be to summarize the responses into a resource such as an article, web site or similar where we can guide others in our field and more importantly, back here for the community.\n\nAppreciate all the thoughtful input so far.

It was inside for months undetected, pulling admin credentials, network maps, traffic flows… the stuff defenders dread. \n\nWhat’s weird to me is how often these 'state-sponsored' attacks aren’t about some sci-fi exploit no one’s ever seen. They’re about living off existing holes, stale configurations, and systems that are just way too hard to update or monitor well enough to notice someone walking around inside. \n\nThe headlines talk strategy and geopolitics, but the real problem feels like we still trust giant interconnected systems to stay invisible until the bad guys decide to leave. That rarely works out well.\n\nIs the cybersecurity community freaking out about 'nation state mastery' or are these breaches really just exposing how fragile our critical networks already are?",

We haven't had a breach in the 25 years I've been here, so it's hard for me to get my c-suite to feel the sense of urgency I do when I look at our threat profile. Forget solutions that cost money, I have just enough budget to pay annual licensing fees and whatever annual increase I get is invariably eaten up by vendor price increases. \n\nAnd that's not even mentioning c-suite members that are concerned (for whatever base reason) with the learning curve of moving from network shares to cloud storage with DLP and App Protection Policies.  I've been fighting that battle since mid 2023 and feel I've made no positive progress.  \n\nWell, at least rumor is the biggest naysayer is retiring this Summer, so :fingers crossed: maybe, just maybe I'll be able to get it pushed through afterwards.",

That is pre-2013 thinking and really does not work anymore.  If someone wants to get into your system, they will.  It is not even about being interconnected, it is about the capabilities of newer systems to find vulnerabilities.  They might be software related or even process related.   Your helpdesk used Employee ID as a validator for users making password resets, but now the employee ID is part of the username and you did not remove that validator.  Those type of process issues crop up over time and are hard to find.    \n  \nWhat you need to do is build your security to say \"when they get in, how will I detect them\".  Things like ingesting all the logs you can, finding anomalies and reporting on them or using time based reviews to say \"This user does not normally work at this time\" is how you catch these things now.  And, in 10-15 years, that will change.  That is the process of cyber.  Threat actors find new ways in and SOCs find how to find them and eliminate the issue.",

And we should blame this administration for kneecapping CISA and dismantling the public-private sector partnership that was focused on investigating Chinese intrusions, but was ultimately dissolved, because why not right?",

It's especially frustrating coming from this background and work.\n\nAs a defender, this made a huge difference in how effective I could be. The public/private partnership stuff worked, and worked well enough to be effective. It wasn't without problems (stale data being a big one) but it was super helpful.",

Nation-state actors just happen to be very good at exploiting that drift patiently.\n\nIn my experience, the hard part isn’t deploying more tools, it’s sustaining basics over years: pruning privileges, validating assumptions, and detecting “normal” that slowly becomes dangerous.

The problem is that this never ends. The IPs constantly shift.\n\nPreviously, I was manually blocking by /24 blocks, but it was too much work to constantly be adding blocks to the firewall, so the script is supposed to handle this, but the attacks and high server load continue.\n\nI literally just temporarily blocked 4.0.0.0/8 and 20.0.0.0/8 just to kill off an attack. MS has many blocks in those two subnets.\n\nUsually, about five times a day, my server is unavailable or degraded due to these probing attacks.

I called the number listed with ICANN and managed to figure out how to search by name, and by trying common last names found actual extensions to call (as well as conference rooms). I have yet to actually connect with a human doing this, even when calling someone's direct extension.\n\nI've found others complaining on Microsoft's help forums, and the MS response completely got it wrong, thinking that the their Azure server was being attacked, not that Azure IPs were attacking an outside server. When corrected on this, the MS rep said that they needed an Azure account for help in that matter (completely sidestepping the issue).\n\nHow best to handle this situation?",

Like $500k/year is a “reasonable” price. I can definitely see it being impossible, but if you can afford it, it’s worth it. \n\nEven with cloudflare you’re going to see bad traffic. Cloudflare just gives you more tools to block what you need to without breaking real traffic.\n\nBefore cloudflare it was a constant flood of ddos attacks in the range of ~250k unique ips. Vultr, digital ocean, and azure were the worst. In order. Probing is constant from everywhere.\n\nA few things I’ve done that work without cloudflare, but do require some work to put together.\n\n- identify bad requests in your logs, and filter by unique IP addresses, and block all requests. I’ve used memcached with ingress-nginx (rip) access_by_lua to check for banned IPs. It was reasonable to about 100k rps per instance on 6-8y old hardware. \n\n- fail2ban. It doesn’t work with billions of ips, but it’s easy to set up. It’s possible someone has an ebpf method that performs better than iptables, but I haven’t looked in a while. \n\n- properly set up robots.txt\n\n- block requests that you know are bad. I.e specific user agents, invalid hostnames, etc.\n\n- set up reasonable rate limits\n\n- just leave client connections hanging. Instead of returning a 403/429, just don’t send a response. (Nginx 444, it works fantastically for botnets in my experience, and ties up at least some resources on the client for a while.)\n\n- appropriate syn flood thresholds on your edge firewalls.",

Good AS would get a high rate limit set *per AS* and unknown AS would get a low rate limit. Exceed the rate limit and the entire AS would get blocked. This way entire data centers would quickly get blocked. This drastic action was needed because the scrapers were down to using a unique IP for every single hit to circumvent rate limits.\n\nOh and auto whitelist IPs from valid search engines which support this with reverse lookups.\n\nThis helps against rented server farms (legit or not). Unfortunately scraping proxy services utilizing paid or exploited peoples personal IPs exist, too, and if numbers of those in your eyeball networks are high you'll have to resort to some sort of user verification.",

However, I would like to have an honest conversation about the reason behind it. I honestly don't know, but I'll give you an honest hiring manager's perspective. \n\nI'm a director at a big(ish) company with a security team of about 20 people. Over the last two years we've tried to fill four entry level roles on our SOC, but were only able to fill two of them. We haven't had a shortage of candidates, but rather a shortage of candidates who were ready for the job. A vast majority of them didn't have any basic networking, operating systems, scripting abilities, or any of the other fundamentals. When it came to \"security skills\" the most I saw was maybe a basic SIEM searching lesson with ELK and maybe a class that showered them Metasploit. However, you could tell the skills didn't really stick because the lack of the aforementioned fundamentals. \n\nMostly, their degrees seemed to be similar to what you would find in a Security+ or CISSP prep course. Mostly theory and risk/compliance. Almost none of them knew what Active Directory was, understood anything about Azure or Amazon's services, or any other common enterprise technology. I know it is harder in school to learn these things, but it wasn't like this a few years ago. Candidates used to know the a basics. \n\nThe two people we hired were students who went out of their way to learn more because they felt their degree wasn't helping too much. Both of them participated in CTFs, had GitHub repos that showed projects they were working on, and other similar initiatives. Almost none of the other candidates had anything besides their degree and a Security+. \n\nI'm not blaming the students, but I believe it's the quality of the programs they attend. These schools that teach them for FOUR YEARS and graduate them like this should be ashamed. I'm sure this isn't the only reason the entry level job market is the way it is, but I can tell you it's certainly part of it. ",

I feel as though I learned an immense amount, esp in the cisco courses,  but most ppl in the program don't really understand most concepts and can't even use operating systems well. \n\n\nI had years of DIY experience but no professional experience before starting the program. I loved most of the courses and tried to absorb as much as possible. \n\n\nAt least 50% of students are low effort tossers, who barely can conceive what virtual infrastructure does,  can't script in bash, and forget reading packets/ headers. They got into the program thinking they were on the easy street to being millionaires and missed the part where you have to know things and do stuff. \n\n\nIt was disheartening,  but there was a small group of awesome, dedicated,  nice individuals who made school great. \n\n\n90% of my class didn't get hired for  co-ops either. I hustled on my applications and got hired at a hospital IT dept. \n\n\nThe sea of mediocre flunkies makes it seem like no one is trying, however there are lots of great people who know the fundamentals,  want to work hard,  want to succeed,  want to contribute, but are getting left out in the cold. ",

If you don’t have the foundations in place,  how can you expect to build something secure on top?  \n\nIt’s a classic story that a lot of us have been preaching, but often get called gatekeepers for stating.    Cyber Security is not entry level.  It requires foundational understanding on how things work.  You don’t need to know every part,   But you need to have that foundation to build off of because so much of the job involves quickly learning and adapting and you need to have the strong base to build off of.   \n\nTheory is awesome,  but just because I understand the theory behind something doesn’t mean I understand how that theory translates to reality. \n\n\nAnother part of the issue I feel is the combination of schooling,  and the advance in technology.   It wasn’t THAT long ago that it was perfectly normal for many of the foundational skills to be learned by hobbyists before they even entered school.   Building a pc,   Setting up a functional home network or lan gaming,    Easy on-ramps.  Upgrading a pc or repairing a problem,  also easy ways to learn. \n\nBut as tech as evolved and become more app focused and disposable,   There are a lot of people entering the pipeline now who never had to resolve an OS/driver conflict,  or upgrade/fix a pc issue.    They are super comfortable with using technology and the internet,  but their experience as a use is much different than it was for people just 5/10yrs earlier.      \n\nAnd the education system has not evolved to account for the lost fundamentals being learned before entering the system.    They’ve build more advanced theory classes but don’t do any checks that people understand what all that theory is built on top of.

Hurdle #1 for both employees and employers is people have the wrong idea of \"cybersecurity.\" Part of that is the cert mills and academic programs that, at best, teach a lot of NIST-level concepts but they ignore the need to understand good IT fundamentals. Part too is media portrayals, and then a large part does fall on candidates who have unrealistic assessments of their skills, pay, or responsibility. Most of the real security jobs I filled came from internal candidates, people who knew our software, systems, policies etc. There are a lot of organization-specific elements to security roles that, if you can't hire internally, you have to be ready to train and bring people up to speed and that's always a bit of a gamble. There are lots of folks who can pass test with flying color, but they can't think on their feet, work with other departments, or cooperatively problem solve. Those soft skills are harder to find than degrees and certificates.",

The list goes on. \n\nI think this is a huge gap considering they all graduated with computer science. Programming isn’t worth jack unless you understand the underlying technologies you’re solving for. I’ll take anyone with domain knowledge and enterprise systems then teach them programming vs a programmer without domain or systems knowledge.",

I have known this for 30 years, my last CISO had a masters in CS, built a linux machine once.  I shit you not.  That's how he introduced himself to the IT dept.  He had never worked in IT, NEVER.  First job CISO.  WTF...\n\n I look at folks with degrees as retards, yep that includes you director of a biggish company.  You advertise for an entry level position with 5+ years experience.  Look entry level is the fry guy at micky d's.  That's someone who can distinguish a bell from all the other noise, just so you know BS in CS hiring manager.\n\nLet's get it straight, there is NO entry level in computer security.  \n\nQuit looking at college grads, let them migrate to help desk if they have a desire to be in IT, they will start there. \n\nThe biggest problem in this field is folks think they know it all because they have a degree and feel like they are owed a huge compensation, title, and a corner office for getting a piece of paper and starting life in 120k in debt.  That's a sign of a dumbass in my opinion.  In CS you are never going to know it all its a vast field, look for the guy that has a desire to learn something new everyday and can RTFM could possibly be the fry guy at micky d's.",

They let go most of their best engineers, and most were only jobless for a few months, because their salary was guaranteed for those months lol, but they all pretty much found just as good or better employment elsewhere as soon as they attempted to do so.",

Not sure if it was because the AI filters didn’t like my resume, if most of the job posts were not real, or if the job market is really this shitty… but your comment is making me believe that it is HR and AI doing a crappy job “filtering”.   If you have someone screening your candidates, ask them to send you all the candidates to verify they are not screwing you.",

              "text": "1) posting jobs online for IT/cybersecurity jobs is almost pointless now because the AI resume screening bots have caused the tech savvy people to create AI job application bots. Try recruiting AFK at literally any of the “hacker” conferences and you’ll find tons of highly qualified IT/tech/cybersecurity people available for work (if the company is willing to pay). Companies seem to think that seasoned cybersecurity people have become less valuable because there are “tons of cybersecurity people” now, but the pool of highly qualified candidates isn’t much bigger than it was before, and they’re still in high demand. They just don’t apply for jobs because they don’t have to.\n\n2) the resume screening bots seem to be very bad at screening resumes and often miss the actually qualified candidates.\n\n3) the vast majority of human HR people are incapable of identifying a competent cybersecurity professional because they discredit anyone with poor social skills.\n\nSource: part of my last two jobs was building IT/cybersecurity teams from scratch. It sucked, but it was easy once I hired via referral rather than job postings. If you tell a bunch of hackers you want to hire one of their friends AND you’ll pay them $2,500 if they send you the right person, you’ll be shocked at the extremely highly qualified candidates that will come out of the wood work. I do also want to point out that many of the experienced cyber people were also heavily involved with crypto early on, so many of them only work for the joy of working now because they’re still wired to do the work they love. So, sometimes it’s about creating the right opportunity, rather than waiting for the “right person.”",

Real estate agents. IT. Real estate agents. Cybersecurity. That is just the past 30 years. Every single time tons of folks quit their job, take a class or two, and chase their gold rush dream only to have reality smack them in their face because they did not perform their due diligence. Look at all of the people chasing red team and pen testing; genuine kudos to learning but folks should be looking at actual job opportunities. That too will likely be bursting in the not so far distant future.\n\nLots of stories of \"30%+ job growth...\". But they do not tell you that is over 10 years so its more like 3% per year. But the pipeline keeps churning out a massive number of folks every single year by people drinking the kool aid.",

The U.S. does not have the climate for rubber trees, so 100% of rubber would be tariffed. Again, this was in anticipation of the new policies - before the new President was even in office was when they felt it was best to close.\n\nThe stock market is growing mostly because the 5-6 big AI companies who keep funding each other. OpenAI said that to break even, they would need to charge clients $2k per month to use ChatGPT. Microsoft is already giving up on Copilot.

I looked past that then during the conversation, he asked me what is my long term plan , I said I love cybersecurity and would love to become an expert, he goes like ‘then this role is not for you’…\n\nWth? , I was mad but I explained that in order to reach my goal I definitely need to start somewhere..\n\nLong story short , after waiting for a month with repeated calls and emails to ask of feedback ( I got no answers by the way ), they just got back to me that the role has been given to someone else and that I was the second best so they will contact me when a new position opens up by the end of Q1 this year.\n\nTo be fair life has been really tough and I’m giving up on my IT and cybersecurity dreams … I just got my SIA badge , I’ll rather take my chances on there done deal with these cooperate stuff.",

It takes at least half a year to bring people up to speed so they can work somewhat unsupervised, which is quite the time-sink and feels just wasteful in this scenario.

Plenty of people start in IT support and move into security later, that’s normal.\n\nFive months of unemployment messes with your head, so don’t beat yourself up for feeling done. Taking a security job to pay bills isn’t “giving up”, it’s just survival.\n\nIf you do decide to keep one foot in IT/cyber, focus less on interviews and more on building confidence again. Hands-on stuff helps a lot with that. Blue-team labs where you actually investigate alerts and incidents are closer to real work than just studying. Platforms like CyberDefenders are good for that because they’re built around SOC workflows, not theory.\n\nEven if you step away for a bit, your interest in cyber doesn’t disappear. You can always come back when things are more stable. One bad hiring experience shouldn’t decide your whole career.",

They can provide a foot in the door somewhere.  \n\n2.  TL/DR Break the ice and make it a conversation about the job vs an interview for the job.  The bad vibes thing is never fun.  Sometimes it's just the person has had a crappy day, other times it's them just going through the motions to satisfy some quota of \"I interviewed 3 people\".  That said, I'm not sure if you were in a sterile meeting area or in his office, but one of the first things I do is look around the office to see what stuff the person has on the walls, on a bookcase, desk, etc., and if I can I'll make a call out about it to try and make a connection.  For example, if I see a baseball on someone's desk I'll say something like, \"Who's your team?\" and motion/nod towards the baseball.  (make sure you know something about baseball, however, and don't talk family stuff..way to many landmines there)  \n  \n3.  Know something about the company and the job before you walk in the door.  If working with a Head Hunter ask about who you'll be interviewing with (your success puts money in their pocket).  If via their HR dept, know some of what they do, who they are, even check out linked in (It has to be good for something, after all).  \n  \n4.  One thing I've responded a few times to the \"where do you want to be in X # of years?\" (and you have to read the room for this) is \"I want your job, and I know that to get that I'll have to promote you out of yours\".  A less bold statement and safer statement might be \"I want to learn the business and move into a senior engineer or leadership role.\"  The point being you need to make the person doing the hiring and firing that you're looking to be on his team and have his back.  \n  \nBest of luck and keep trying!",

Does it need fact checking?  OF COURSE it does, do you not fact check your security analysts when they do their investigations?  Of course you do.

Hiring someone else is not carte blanche to not give a fuck. Ubisoft has enough technical resources to be expected to vet a contractors processes and policies for handling data, more than enough technical know-how to be held liable in the case of a breach. It might be different for small businesses or solo, non-technical workers who don't have the capacity or knowledge to assess a vendor's security practices. But Ubisoft is not such an organization.\n\nIn this case it's probably not relevant unless actual consumer data or payment methods are shown to be compromised due to the outsourcing, but your statement is just wrong.",

          "text": "\"A new sample of the ToneShell backdoor, typically seen in Chinese cyberespionage campaigns, has been delivered through a kernel-mode loader in attacks against government organizations.\n\nThe backdoor has been attributed to the Mustang Panda group, also known as HoneyMyte or Bronze President, that usually targets government agencies, NGOs, think tanks, and other high-profile organizations worldwide.\n\nSecurity researchers at Kaspersky analyzed a malicious file driver found on computer systems in Asia and discovered that it has been used in campaigns since at least February 2025 against government organizations in Myanmar, Thailand, and other Asian countries.\n\nEvidence showed that the compromised entities had prior infections with older ToneShell variants, PlugX malware, or the ToneDisk USB worm, also attributed to state-sponsored Chinese hackers.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, the new ToneShell backdoor was deployed by a mini-filter driver named ProjectConfiguration.sys and signed with a stolen or leaked certificate valid between 2012 and 2015 and issued to Guangzhou Kingteller Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nMini-filters are kernel-mode drivers that plug into the Windows file-system I/O stack and can inspect, modify, or block file operations. Security software, encryption tools, and backup utilities typically use them.\n\nProjectConfiguration.sys embeds two user-mode shellcodes in its .data section, each executed as a separate user-mode thread to be injected into user-mode processes.\n\nTo evade static analysis, the driver resolves required kernel APIs at runtime by enumerating loaded kernel modules and matching function hashes, rather than importing functions directly.\n\nIt registers as a mini-filter driver and intercepts file-system operations related to deletion and renaming. When such operations target the driver itself, they are blocked by forcing the request to fail.\n\nThe driver also protects its service-related registry keys by registering a registry callback and denying attempts to create or open them. To ensure priority over security products, it selects a mini-filter altitude above the antivirus-reserved range.\n\nAdditionally, the rootkit interferes with Microsoft Defender by modifying the configuration of the WdFilter driver so it is not loaded into the I/O stack.\n\nTo shield injected user-mode payloads, the driver maintains a list of protected process IDs, denies handle access to those processes while the payloads are executing, and removes protection once execution completes.\n\n\"This is the first time we’ve seen ToneShell delivered through a kernel-mode loader, giving it protection from user-mode monitoring and benefiting from the rootkit capabilities of the driver that hides its activity from security tools,\" says Kaspersky.\n\nThe new variant of the ToneShell backdoor that Kaspersky analyzed features changes and stealth enhancements. The malware now uses a new host identification scheme based on a 4-byte host ID market instead of the 16-byte GUID used previously, and also applies network traffic obfuscation with fake TLS headers.\n\nIn terms of the supported remote operations, the backdoor now supports the following commands:\n\n0x1 — Create a temporary file for incoming data\n\n0x2 / 0x3 — Download file\n\n0x4 — Cancel download\n\n0x7 — Establish a remote shell via a pipe\n\n0x8 — Receive operator command\n\n0x9 — Terminate shell\n\n0xA / 0xB — Upload file\n\n0xC — Cancel upload\n\n0xD — Close connection\n\nKaspersky advises that memory forensics is key in uncovering ToneShell infections backed by the new kernel-mode injector.\n\nThe researchers have high confidence in attributing the new ToneShell backdoor sample to the Mustang Panda cyberespionage group. They assess that the threat actor has evolved its tactics, techniques, and procedures to gain operational stealth and resilience.\n\nThe cybersecurity company provides in its report a short list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) to help organizations detect Mustang Panda intrusions and defend against them.\"",

I start a new gig later this month, here's what I had to do. \n\nLinkedin full of all the right words, nobody is going to actually read it, but it has to scan well enough for both bot or person to see what they want. \n\nI searched every single technology recruitment firm (not corporate recruitment as part of their HR) and messaged each and every one of them with my resume. Some only communicate on linkedin via messaging, some have their own web page with a form you fill and some just have email. Write an introductory blurb you can recycle and use it for your email or forms. I could hit about 30 in about two hours if I were focused. I filtered based on US location (but you may do it differently) and more than 10k followers. You'll hit some duds and dead ends, but it is a numbers game. Remember 3rd party recruiters only get paid when they fill a spot. You don't have to be the best person for the role, you just have to be easy to sell and most importantly AVAILABLE immediately. They are incentivized to pump you up for the interview. This approach got me the most traction. I had quite a few interviews with this approach, I got my last job using this method. Sadly, I couldn't close any positions I interviewed for, probably close to a dozen calls. \n\nOf all the irony, I got my current role by doing the thing I've NEVER in my life done. I applied on the company website, interviewed and got the role. Seriously, this approach has gotten me the fewest number of interviews and has never, until now, resulted in a job. \n\nI did not waste my time redoing my resume for each and every job. If you're applying to similar roles, there should be no reason to do this. I bought a subscription to Teal, I didn't find it very useful. It was slow and clunky, there was no button that would just tune your resume. It would just show you what was wrong and tell you to fix it. Would not recommend. I bought another that literally robo-filled applications for you on a select number of websites. It worked REALLY well, so if you're going for straight numbers, you might want to do it. You populated your data, gave it search criteria and just let it run. It seriously just auto-fills EVERYTHING for you, never got hung up or stuck and just ran as long as you let it run. You have to buy credits to fuel it, but they were cheap. I think it was called LiftMyCV.",

Compliance and grc can greatly impact finances if something goes wrong, but it's often a backburnered position. \n\nThe battle you're facing is one of being unique in your field. This is going to require things like making your resume a bit more modern. Try looking at different resume templates on places like canva for ideas on that front. You'll also need individualized cover letters for each position you apply for. Since 90% of the resumes your sending out are filtered through ai before they even get to a person, cover letters add extra bs to the like that may satisfy the rubric they're grading applicants on. \n\nLastly, networking is going to be your friend. You're going to need to use LinkedIn or go to some in person conferences and \"expand your professional network\" to get your resume and skills in front of more people. My success rate on blind applications is far lower than jobs referred by someone in my network. \n\nGood luck!",

You already mentioned the clearance issue but I could also see these two things holding it back. I’m not the most experienced person out there but I have recruiters out of the blue hitting me up ever so often on LinkedIn for jobs and I assume it’s because of my resume. I list everything in bullets and keep any descriptions to one line as much as possible while keep text and character spacing as compact as possible so it’s all on one page.

Military specific acronyms that no one knows about, choose a different word that translates.\n\nCater your resume to each job board posting. Key word filters. You need enough of a percentage to pass the bot to be passed onto the HR recruiter. Then that person (who knows nothing about technology and security) needs to look at your resume and understand it enough for you to be passed onto the hiring manager.\n\nEmployers basically want your resume to look like you already have that job without them trying to decipher it.\n\nIf you're applying for a Security job, highlight those details of experience and drop items that don't relate or matter. Keep your highest degree and applicable certs in your resume, drop everything else. Summary statement should be catered to the job your applying to. Most people don't read past the first half of the first page of your resume.\n\nIf Company 'A' lists a tool or workflow but you've not used it but have experience with a similar tool, put it in your resume.  You can explain in the interview. \n\nSpend a few hours building an AI bot that will spit out a unique resume for each listing. Also track what jobs you've applied to with what resume.

The goal was to stop bookmarking dead GitHub repos and create a searchable, filterable database.\n\nSince then, the list has grown from \\~100 to **930+ tools**.\n\n**What changed:**\n\n* **Search & Filtering:** You can now filter specifically by category (e.g., \"Social Media\", \"Dark Web\", \"People Search\") to cut through the noise.\n* **Community Submission:** The biggest request was the ability to add tools. I’ve added a submission engine so if you maintain a repo or find a new tool, you can add it to the index yourself.\n* **Availability Status:** We are tracking which tools are free vs. paid (and those that are \"freemium\" traps).\n\n**The Directory:** You can browse the full list here: [**https://think-pol.com/tools**](https://think-pol.com/tools)\n\n**No login required.** No paywall. Just a clean index.\n\nI’m currently doing a manual review to tag the \"Risk Level\" of the new batch (flagging tools that are aggressive scrapers vs. passive lookups). If you see a tool that is miscategorized or broken, please use the report/submit button so I can fix it.\n\nHope this helps in your work.",

America’s cyber vulnerabilities aren’t about org charts, they’re about:\n\nOutdated government IT systems\n\nCritical infrastructure weaknesses (power grids, water treatment, healthcare)\n\nPoor coordination between existing agencies (CISA, FBI cyber, military cyber commands)\n\nThe fact that most targets are *civilian*, not military\n\nThe philosophical split is interesting: one camp sees cyber as a warfighting domain requiring military solutions, the other sees it as primarily a civilian infrastructure problem that adding another Pentagon branch won’t fix.\n\nWorth noting that U.S. Cyber Command already exists and coordinates across Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. The question is whether a dedicated branch would improve things or just add another layer to an already fragmented ecosystem.\n\nThe timing matters, nation-state actors (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) are getting more sophisticated, and we’re still dealing with fallout from incidents like Colonial Pipeline and SolarWinds that hit civilian infrastructure, not military targets.\n\nThoughts?\n\nSource: [The Signal - Military Leaders Question New Cyber Force](https://www.thes1gnal.com/article/military-leaders-question-new-cyber-force-debate-intensifies-over-federal-cybers)",

Two things can happen simultaneously. And the creation of a branch is for a different purpose than the creation of a major command. Yes, the command exists, however the existence of it doesn’t kill justification for a cyber branch. That is like saying we have CENTCOM so we don’t need the Army as a branch. The point of the branch is coordinated force generation that is removed from the priorities of the other branches, as there isn’t a need for a cyber operator to be a Marine or a Soldier, per se. They need to be a cyber operator. And the army and USMC just may not be the best way to create them or set their training priorities. ",

Ultimately, your parent Service writes your evaluation. If you do not meet their traditional requirements which often conflict with the intense technical demands of cyber operations you pay the price with your career. We are asking operators to master a complex, evolving craft on and off duty, yet we judge them by standards designed for tanks, ships, and infantry. This creates a chaotic environment where operators sitting next to one another are held to vastly different standards depending on the uniform they wear.\n\nA unified Cyber Force is the only path forward. We need a system where the leadership that directs the mission is also the leadership that sets the standard. We need a structure that allows operators to focus on one goal: being the most lethal cyber warriors capable of defending US interests.",

Anyone in that branch would probably have a TS clearance and be targets of adversaries.\n\nPros:\n-Uniform standards and training hopefully optimized to produce the best talent.\n\n-Service specific duties and overhead can be removed: No more sending cyber Marines to recruiter or embassy duty just because their branch requires it. The PT and administrative requirements that were variable across the branches are now uniform.\n\n-Culture shifts to academic and professional excellence instead of service ideology.\n\n-Increased retention due to less non-technical administrative burdens and antiquated ideas.\n\n***\n\nHow I think it should be done:\n\nUS Cybercom billets become the new Cyberforce branch billets. A Cyberforce bootcamp and AIT lead to those billets.\n\nServices still have cyber personnel that go through their own bootcamps, but then they go through Cyberforce AIT, and then back to their service afterwards.",

Making it its own branch would probably only serve to hamstring collaboration. Technological vulnerability is not a domain in the same way land, sea, air, space are -- it's a domain that exists wherever technology does, i.e. in all of those places.\n\nSecond of all, by far the gains in sophistication and scale have been made on the cybercrime front, not from nation-state nexus actors ... this has served to seriously complicate the national security situation by injecting a ton of ambiguity and volume of malicious activity into the system. Attribution is harder, attack chain components as a service sold by ecrime actors are leveraged by nation-state, the relationship between governments and malicious actors acting within their sphere of influence provides gains via economies of scale, i.e. when an adversary needs opportunistic access to a company or person based on shifting geopolitical realities the chance they can just lean heavy on a crime actor to seize existing access is at an all time high.\n\nThe best \"easy\" thing to do to clarify the operational picture would be to aggressively, very aggressively go after ecrime operators. What's the difference between them and South American drug cartels?

I.e. \"man train and equip\" to then provide forces to combatant commands. The Navy or the Airforce don't fight wars, INDOPACOM and EUCOM do.\n\nThe reason a Space Force was stood up, but not a cyber force, is that Spacd assets were getting expensive enough that no single service had enough room in their budgets to support what they needed from space. So in an attempt to reduce possible redundancy and limit fights over space assets, Space Force was created. Not to fight in space or anything like that, but to consolidate the funding.\n\nPeople here talking about military cyber are completely uninformed about how it actually works. There already IS a joint force school everyone has to send their sailors/soldiers/airmen/etc. through. And to my knowledge, the Navy was the last holdout on making a dedicated Cyber officer and enlisted community. So they aren't being ranked against pilots and tankers and such, they are being ranked against the rest of the service cyber talent.\n\nLast but possibly most important, the career paths for the service cyber people mostly looks like a rotating role at CYBERCOM and their service cyber needs. The entire point of that is to try and cross pollinate the knowledge so that there isn't just a silo of really expert people and an entire joint force of clueless idiots.\n\nA \"Cyber Force\" will make sense when the cost of cyber capabilities grows so large that they need a dedicated department at the Pentagon to run the funding. And I personally don't think that would be a good thing for the military cyber community, because now they have to fight with all the other, more established branches for the same limited budget, while losing any of the emotional weight of the traditional services when lobbying Congress.",

We want the chain of command to serve the need while minimizing redundancy/delay. \n\nMilitary already follows the matrix structure, with having branches, commands, joint chiefs of staff etc. \n\nMost generals also sound like cunts, who selfishly want restrict  competition to assimilate power and never give it up. Rather than solve problems they love to ignore problems to push them off onto someone else. \n\nExample: generals get promoted for delivering ahead of schedule. If they find a quality problem that threatens soldiers lives or mission success they usually prefer to ignore it to ensure their own performance delivery and let someone else figure it out after delivery. \n\nNo one is surprised that generals don't want to give up command, capabilities, responsibility, and without a clear argument otherwise I'm not sure that the military needs 20 branches.",

It’s slow, painful, and easy to mess up.\n\nI’m curious — how are other teams handling this?\nAre you using spreadsheets, GRC tools, Notion, something else?\n\nI’m asking because I started building a small internal tool to search across our policies and past answers using AI, and it’s already saving us a ton of time. But I’m not sure if this pain is just us or if others feel it too.\n\nWould love to hear how you’re dealing with this.\n",

Add columns for \"alternative question 1\", \"alternative question 2\" to make keyword searching more effective. (free [Notion template here](https://www.notion.so/2cf8369439288046911cff236e8eecb7?v=2cf836943928809ba494000c5462467b&source=copy_link))\n* Use ChatGPT / LLM with care. Using your exported knowledge base from above + an LLM can be effective but you need to check each answer to make sure it ties back to KB entry or is empty if there is nothing relavent.\n* Use a dedicated tool. There are a few out there: Vanta and Drata have them as a bundled add on. Conveyor is great for larger orgs with dedicated compliance teams. I'm building ResponseHub specifically for smaller teams (self-serve, PAYG pricing, built in explainers).",

Most teams have policies, audits, past questionnaires, and risk decisions scattered across tools, so every new questionnaire becomes a manual reconciliation exercise. That’s where inconsistencies creep in.\n\nA few patterns I keep noticing:\n\n* Teams start with spreadsheets because they’re flexible, then they collapse under version control and ownership issues.\n* GRC tools help with compliance tracking, but they’re often rigid when it comes to narrative, context-heavy questionnaires.\n* Notion works for early-stage teams, but it doesn’t scale well once audits, vendors, and regulators get involved.\n\nThe teams that suffer less are the ones that standardize *how* answers are governed, assign clear ownership, map controls, and agree on a shared language before worrying about tooling. Automation helps, but only after that foundation exists.\n\nYour AI approach makes sense to me, especially for search and consistency. The bigger question is how teams ensure answers stay aligned with actual controls and risk posture over time, not just fast responses.\n\nCurious to see how others here are balancing speed vs accuracy as well.",

Your 1 guy fully completes a SIG questionnaire and a CAIQ (or gets the information from the companies you support) and provides these completed questionnaires to whomever provides you a 'questionnaire' as your stock response - you give these to them and let them know these are industry standard questionnaires and cover all the security and privacy controls their hearts could desire.\n\nVendors who undergo the SOC2 would host the trust portals (of course there are SaaS solutions for this) for distributing audit and compliance reports,  it's pretty common these days because of the same problem raised in this post -- volume. Also, Trust Portals can automatically watermark for NDA protections as well as let you know someone actually accessed them.",

Everyone sends their own version because nobody trusts anyone else’s baseline. That’s why the questions keep growing, even when 80% of them don’t change the actual risk decision.\n\nThe only thing that really scales is having a single, well-maintained source of truth: clear policies, mapped controls, pre-approved evidence, and a documented scope. Tools and AI can help you retrieve and format answers faster, but they don’t replace judgment. If you don’t know what your real posture is, automating the answers just helps you be wrong more efficiently.",

If you can’t speak \"Janitor,\" \"Java,\" and \"Jargon,\" you’re just a person with a spreadsheet - not a GRC professional.\n\n​Final Grade: PASS (With Distinction)\n\n​Note: No remediation required.

The commonality among governance, risk, and compliance is they are all strategic in nature, meaning they are mostly in the hands of the senior level of an organization (e.g., board or ownership). While there are components that are operational, that's mostly the box checking, the data collection. Translating that data into an actionable strategy, however, takes a lot of experience and general business acumen.  Whether addressing GRC in a third-party role (auditing or consulting) or internally, it can be very challenging because you end up sandwiched between a senior level that might not respect your strategic insight and operational employees who don't think you have the technical chops. This is why, in my experience, the people who are effective in the job tend to have pretty deep resumes.",

But “breaking into” the field generally requires someone either giving you a chance or you having an adjacent skillset that is close enough to the one needed in cybersecurity. \n\nSo from that perspective it’s probably easiest depending on where you’re coming from.  If you’re just looking to break into grc because of something like money, be warned — grc work requires a generalist command of multiple domains, a level of discipline and attention to detail that isn’t as robustly enforced in other domains.\n\nFor my money, it’s easiest to go:\n- developer / app sec\n- network admin / network security\n- it help desk / msp\n-",

          "text": "Would you trust an E1 to lead you into battle?\n\nA long time ago, people on LinkedIn tried to argue that you didn't need technical experience or a home lab to make it in cybersecurity. And now, I am going to grab an excerpt from an article I wrote in response to this:\n\nYou need to see what it really takes to get your compliance initiative off the ground, so that you can be sure that your team of engineers can actually pull off what you're going to put on them.\n\nWhat will you have to say when a customer asks you a tough question that requires actual hands-on knowledge? Ask the engineers you tasked with an assignment without actually knowing whether or not the job was done correctly? I couldn’t fathom being responsible for building or managing (and attesting to the deliverables from) a team of cybersecurity professionals if I didn’t have some form of hands-on experience in what I was managing. Most people work their way up to management from said trenches; whereas they have developed, through trials and tribulation, the skills necessary to guarantee a good job is done.\n\nHaving hands-on experience sifting through logs or applying procedure to policy hints at a much deeper degree of understanding and capability. This is what companies are really looking for today. Not a master of theory. Not a pencil pusher. A practitioner. A doer. They want someone they can trust.\n\nWhen you are getting a job in cyber, you are being trusted to handle the most sensitive aspects of a business. If all you have is some theory and limited experience with online lab exercises, but you’ve “never actually touched a router” or applied a ZTA framework to a network design (or even used a console cable) then how can you expect a business to take you seriously and entrust the physical routers and their actual IT infrastructure to you when you are supposed to “know this stuff” inside and out? Are they supposed to just trust that you can provide legitimate attestation of compliance that would stand up to scrutiny or hold up in a court of law? Audits must be verified, because there are times when automated scans will come back missing key information about infrastructure or services, or cannot be performed on sensitive architecture.\n\nYes, we have jobs that don’t require you to physically touch things, but these all require skills that in of themselves will expose you to what you would have seen in your own lab anyways. Being prepared; knowing what you are looking at; is worth gold. With hands-on experience, you won't just know what it really takes to get a stack up to snuff, you'll know how to prove it was done correctly. You won't be able to do that otherwise.\n\nEnd excerpt. With all that being said, GRC is not a beginner-friendly job because, as I mentioned in the trials and tribulations bit, you need to know what it really looks like to take a system, harden it, apply policy that aligns with an organizational goal, and provide legitimate attestation of compliance. It is more suited for people that value a desk job more than the thrill of the chase, and people tend to loathe auditors. Orin Thomas  of Microsoft famously refers to them during his seminars as \"The Guys With Ties,\" and frames them as  villains.",

So I’d say yeah you can definitely break into GRC with no experience. But will you be effective? Probably not, and your security engineer/sysadmin team is probably going to hate you.\n\nMy recommendation would be to try to go for a security focused sysadmin role first. Learn the basics of system architecture first, and how to secure it. After that, it’s a bit easier to pivot to GRC, full security engineering, incident response, or general SOC roles.",

Someone who’s very strong technically but has poor communication skills and never learned out to write can often be a very bad fit.  It’s also important they think systematically.  GRC you can’t just do one thing well.  You have to think across the organization how different processes tie together.  If you tend to be someone that can do that, may be a good fit.  If you’re someone that does better mastering repeatable processes GRCs not the place.  You have to really know yourself and what your strengths are.",

It also requires a fair handle on general tech subjects so you can speak about them eloquently and understand how it fits in your slice of GRC.  I would argue it isn't easy to be successful.  I will agree that hiring managers tend to put the wrong bodies in GRC spots often.  \n\nGRC also is not for people with tech backgrounds that NEED to get their hands dirty.  You will have almost zero opportunity to fix something that isn't a process or procedure.  You also will not want to seek that out as GRC because when you get busy, it's real tedious, and others will just expect you to help the stuff you added on because \"That GRC person never seems busy\".    \n\nHonestly, the two spots I've seen in most large orgs that are easy/coastable spots are:\n\nVulnerability Reporting - and I don't mean people who do actual vulnerability management but the ones who merely run the tool and do reports.  They often won't be trained very well on whatever tool they're using, they'll often claim that \"managing\" the vulnerability is on the owners of the system, not on their team as they just report them.   I've been at numerous big orgs at this point and it's the same story - vuln management just reports, doesn't fix.   And they'll almost never be able to do the report you want.  \n\nThird Party Risk Management - no offense to the TPRM folks in the crowd, but I've never met another team that acts like managing the relationship with a vendor through surveys is the most grueling thing they've ever done in their life.  My main friend in TPRM sends me messages almost every day about how he didn't wake up until noon and no one came looking for him.  The other people on his team show up and leave at all hours and no one cares.  It's absolutely fucking mind blowing to me.   The other big orgs I've been at had one, maybe two people doing this work - this one has a team and they're not that much bigger of an org.  You want a cake walk?  This is it.",

We’re obsessed with the \"cool\" stuff, the zero-day exploits and the nation-state actors.......but 90% of the breaches I actually see (or read about in post-mortems) start with a simple misconfigured S3 bucket or a leaked credential that had way more permissions than it ever needed.\n\nIs it just that \"Least Privilege\" is too boring to sell to leadership? Or is it that actually enforcing it is so manual and painful that we’d rather just buy a shiny new tool and hope for the best?\n\nI’ve been trying to document some \"sanity-first\" IAM guardrails on OrbonCloud lately to help bridge that gap, but It'd be helpful(for the sub also) to hear how you guys keep the basics from slipping while everyone else is distracted by the latest \"AI\" security buzzword.",

The internal pentests need to have the normal testing context and the assumed-breach context. The latter is usually ignored, but it's very important. \n\nIt really does take a village. It's OK to use vendors, but if you're reliant on them, you're likely doing it wrong.",

The basics, like least privileges, need to be integrated into the day-to-day workflow in a way that adds value to the people doing the work.  For example, consider the process and workflows around data flows and firewall ACLs.  The goal is the least amount of network access that still allows the application, system, or software to operate and perform well.  For many sys admins, the goal is to get their stuff working on the network.  The primary objective is functionality and performance, not necessarily least access or least privileges on the network.  Security and compliance’s primary objective is security, which includes least access and least privileges.  To maintain the basics over time, the process has to add value to both groups of people.  Meaning, from the sys admins’ perspective, the process should produce connectivity quickly, and from the security perspective, the connectivity should be optimized for security. \n\nThe challenge is that the complexity of this exercise increases with the size and complexity of the organization.  At some inflection point, spreadsheets, emails, and tickets cannot accommodate the workflow efficiently, and the basics start to get undermined due to urgency, lack of patience, and simply frustration with the process. \n\nIts all about understanding the goals of the people in the process and then optimizing the process to achieve the goals efficiently.

          "text": "\"A new ClickFix social engineering campaign is targeting the hospitality sector in Europe, using fake Windows Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) screens to trick users into manually compiling and executing malware on their systems.\n\nA BSOD is a Windows crash screen displayed when the operating system encounters a fatal, unrecoverable error that causes it to halt.\n\nIn a new campaign first spotted in December and tracked by researchers at Securonix as \"PHALT#BLYX,\" phishing emails impersonating Booking.com led to a ClickFix social engineering attack that deployed malware.\n\nClickFix social engineering attacks are webpages designed to display an error or issue and then offer \"fixes\" to resolve it. These errors could be fake error messages, security warnings, CAPTCHA challenges, or update notices that instruct visitors to run a command on their computer to fix the issue.\n\nVictims end up infecting their own machines by running malicious PowerShell or shell commands provided in the attacker's instructions.\n\nIn this new ClickFix campaign, attackers send phishing emails that impersonate a hotel guest cancelling their Booking.com reservation, typically sent to a hospitality firm. The claimed refund amount is significant enough to create a sense of urgency for the recipient of the email.\n\nClicking the link in the email takes the victim to a fake Booking.com website hosted on 'low-house[.]com,' which Securonix characterizes as a \"high-fidelity clone\" of the real Booking.com site.\n\n\n\"The page utilizes official Booking.com branding, including the correct color palette, logos, and font styles. To the untrained eye, it is indistinguishable from the legitimate site,\" reports Securonix.\n\nThe site hosts malicious JavaScript that displays a fake \"Loading is taking too long\" error to the target, prompting them to click a button to refresh the page.\n\nHowever, when the target clicks the button, the browser instead enters full-screen mode and displays a fake Windows BSOD crash screen that initiates the ClickFix social engineering attack.\n\nThe screen prompts the person to open the Windows Run dialog box and then press CTRL+V, which pastes a malicious command copied to the Windows clipboard.\n\nThe user is then prompted to press the OK button or Enter on their keyboard to execute the command.\n\nReal BSOD messages do not offer recovery instructions and only display an error code and a reboot notice, but inexperienced users or hospitality staff under pressure to resolve a dispute may overlook these signs of trickery.\n\nPasting the provided command runs a PowerShell command that opens a decoy Booking.com admin page. At the same time, in the background, it downloads a malicious .NET project (v.proj) and compiles it with the legitimate Windows MSBuild.exe compiler.\n\nWhen executed, the payload adds Windows Defender exclusions and triggers UAC prompts to gain admin rights, before it downloads the primary loader using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) and establishes persistence by dropping a .url file in the Startup folder.\n\nThe malware (staxs.exe) is DCRAT, a remote access Trojan commonly used by threat actors for remote access to infected devices.\n\nThe malware is injected into the legitimate 'aspnet_compiler.exe' process using process hollowing and executed directly in memory.\n\nUpon first contact with the command-and-control (C2) server, the malware sends its full system fingerprint and then waits for commands to execute.\n\nIt supports remote desktop functionality, keylogging, reverse shell, and in-memory execution of additional payloads. In the case observed by Securonix, the attackers dropped a cryptocurrency miner.\n\nWith remote access established, the threat actors now have a foothold on the target's network, allowing them to spread to other devices, steal data, and potentially compromise other systems.\"",

I thought I was fucked, no job car my family hated me all by the age of 25.\n\nThen when I was sacked I tried a level 3 cyber course. Everyone in my class dropped it out it ended up just me and him and I learnt a lot and really enjoyed.\n\nI started Tryhackme, rooms were getting me locked in for hours even on the simplest of rooms. But this was distracting me from my addiction and keeping me occupied.\n\n2 years later I am in a new job as help desk technician. I impressed my work and they have paid for me to do my 4 year cyber degree whilst working. I also got sec+, completed 100rooms and planning on eJPT exam. I Don’t get high no where near as much anymore where as my fix used to be on my mind constantly I now have exploits, latest cyber news and cyber in my head \n\nIf anyone has any advice or tips much appreciated I would say Cyber security saved me!!",

AI *is*  helping in a lot of ways. \n\nBut the more I dig into it the more it feels like ai is also creating just as many problems as it’s solving.\n\nSome reports say 13% of companies have already experienced AI related security incidents and 97% of them admitted they dont even have proper ai access controls in place. That’s… not great.\n\nAnd i feel like most ai security features still seem like slightly improved versions of what we already have.\n\nSo I keep asking myself: what ai capability would actually change the game for cybersecurity?\n\nwhat's your suggestion on this?",

Most of the agent tools like Copilot and Claude offer sandboxing and allowing/disallowing certain tools, for example file modification and such, and enabling requiring-approvals, but that's all disabled by default and has to be configured by the user. \n\nThere exists a need to apply preventative controls to all users, and I'm not sure what the answer is.",

LLM is prone to hallucinations and Symbolic is logic based and needs constant rules updating. \n\nBoth so far are generalist and don't understand nuance or your operating environment. \n\nAn action done by customer service could be a compromised account but if it was done by engineering or done in a test environment would be completely legitimate. \n\nI like symbolic because I can understand what logic is being applied and can quickly rule in or rule out an alert. The black box nature of LLM leaves me questioning why an alert went off. Like why does it compute that this is malicious. \n\nI think that AI could have a possibility of helping if it is augmented with all the relevant information such as employee dept and title and if it was baselined with about 5 years of normal activity within your environment. \n\nSo far I have seen a lot of sloppy AI work. I believe that it still needs humans to check what it's doing. \n\nIf anything it's helped the offense more than the defense. Fixing the grammar and spelling for phishing emails but there's still things that I spot in phishing that AI hasn't fixed yet.

Better writing, more persuasive emails, etc. Video and voice emulation is probably going to start changing the way we trust videoconferencing, but it'll mostly be at the whaling level since it requires real-time attention by the attacker.\n\nOn the employment side of things, expect to see companies trying to get by with fewer low-end analyst jobs. My advice there is essentially unchanged, however, which is that trying to get an \"entry level cybersecurity job\" is generally a bad idea. Get a helpdesk position, develop a thorough understanding of how computers and networking works when it's not under attack, then pivot into cybersecurity once you have a few years under your belt.\n\nFrom a product perspective, expect every company to claim AI is now powering their software. That will mean wildly differing things and should mostly be ignored. Consider whether the resultant product functions well or not, same as ever.\n\nIn terms of \"how will companies allow their employees to interact with LLMs?\", expect places to settle on single solutions that they pay to not incorporate queries into training data.

Did not dive into the details, but it does not guarantee 100% accuracy.\n\n Also the two key factors of a firewall is efficacy and performance, so if there is an inline ML engine in the datapath, it should be high performance. \n\nBut yes, AI has hallucinations, and raises both false positives and negatives.

Totally on board with that, that’s the whole point.\n\nBut one of the tests ended up submitting a form around 500 times. The form is basically a license agreement/request form, and each submission triggers internal email notifications. So we got 500 internal emails back-to-back (nothing external, thank god), plus a bunch of other downstream notification triggers.\n\nWe had no heads-up the test was happening.\n\nOn one hand: this is a legit finding (rate limiting, abuse controls, side effects, etc). Awesome. That’s what we want to learn.\n\nOn the other hand: how do orgs do this in a way that still tests the real app, but doesn’t spam everyone or accidentally kick off a bunch of workflows every time someone runs a tool?\n\nBecause the “obvious” mitigations feel like they defeat the purpose:\n\n* If we turn off email notifications in staging, we wouldn’t have seen the issue.\n* If we block certain routes, aren’t we just making the test less real?\n* But if the test can hammer business workflows with no guardrails, it’s basically an internal attack.\n\nSo what’s the normal way to manage this between dev + security?\n\nDo you:\n\n* maintain a dedicated test environment with email sinks and fake integrations?\n* have a strict rules-of-engagement doc with rate limits and “do not spam” constraints?\n* require change windows / notifications before testing starts? - this seems like a no brainer and something we have already implemented post incident \n* build “test mode” into the app so requests still exercise logic but don’t fan out?\n\nNot mad about the finding.

You do try to keep that latter part to a minimum, but there's a limit to how real the test will be if you make it too strict. \n\nRoE's also define what kind of things can be done if the tester gets access.  So, for example, no submitting a form 500 times, or at the very least how many times per minute/hour/day it will be allowed. \n\nYes, having a test or pre-prod environment to run much more extensive, targeted, and frequent testing is a good idea if it's practical to actually do.  That doesn't replace the pen testing, it is done in addition to the pen testing.  This is where you do the stuff that it isn't viable to try in prod, and also where pre-launch testing and dynamic code testing is done. \n\nThe goal is to have the combination cover all the bases - but at a cost.  Not a lot of orgs have a pre-prod environment, either due to budget restrictions or just not having anywhere to host and maintain it. \n\nThen there's Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) - this is NON-disruptive and NON-destructive testing meant to be done in production on a very regular basis.  An example is an attempt to do a script injection against a database system, but requesting \"null\" so that even if that works, no data is actually accessed. If you get an error, it was blocked, if you get an actual null as the reply, the controls failed. BAS is almost always done \"in the clear\" - meaning both the red teamers and the blue teamers know it's happening and can therefore make appropriate preparations like setting up target accounts/email boxes, etc.",

Is it usually one RoE per test suite (covers the whole test) with some callouts for specific systems, or do teams write separate RoEs per test/tool?\n\nAlso, for stuff like form submits that trigger emails, do you typically handle that via explicit rate limits in the RoE, or do you push the app/dev side to provide “safe” targets (mail sink, test inboxes, stubbed integrations), or both?\n\nAnd yep, the repeating theme I’m hearing is communication is the real control plane here. We can fix the technical stuff, but if nobody knows it’s happening, we’re gonna keep tripping over each other.",

Rate limiting would normally just delay the problem and not fix it unless you actually dropped the emails. With this being staging there should be staging harnesses in place to not actually send x emails, but still show that the process works and shows in the metrics and alerts when a certain threshold is reached so you still catch the issue (canary).\n\nOther than that what should and shouldn't happen should be agreed upon within the statement of work that is being followed.  Without that there should be no penetration test until things are thoroughly reviewed and agreed upon for what is and what is not acceptable along with the scope and range of testing that will be done.",

Imagine the form or some change would ever have some kind of infinite loop. \n\nIf I'm not totally mistaken this is not only my opinion / experience but a must or at least should from ISO27001: staging and testing environments are not meant to connect back into production.\n\nHelpful other aspect: staging should in general absolutely not be allowed to send external emails. It should _not_ be necessary.\nThere may be exemptions but those should be very limited and very restricted.\n\n\nThe general pen test issue:\n\nYou inform all those involved, especially everyone at connecting systems, that a PenTest will be run and how e.g. mails will be identifiable automatically such that it can be decided if mail or the ticketing system is also under test - or not.\n\nA good pen tester can tell you: \"well I was allowed to send in the form 500 times in a minute. Nothing stopped me. This is not good - no matter if your servers could handle it\".\n\nSo turning it off for the rest, even when it's a production environment, is possible. \nOr setting up routines to count, but automatically delete or directly close the ticket.\n\nOr accept you will potentially have a planned loss that day, test your emergency documents to, and run a cleanup in the end.\n\nAll three work, I've seen all three done, which is better is a matrer of risk, but doing it without guardrails _sonetimes_ with prep and warning is a good idea - a real attack wouldn't give you either.",

There's courses out there from places like pwnedlabs that has a lot of easily accessible material for a low fee like $20/mo to practice on their infra so you don't break things.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into cloud on your own, spin up your own Azure/AWS tenant and check out projects like AzureGOAT or AWSGOAT and see how you can look into those - they have tutorials on how to exploit vulns. See if you can use the material you looked at above to secure it properly, then try again to exploit and verify your changes worked.\n\nIt depends on what you want to do, but there's lots of stuff you can do to go learn if you want.",

I’ve done labs and theory (SIEM basics, alerts, MITRE ATT&CK, etc.), but I want to better understand how SOC analysts actually think during a real shift.\n\nIf you work in a SOC, could you walk through (at a high level / sanitized example) things like:\n\n• How you triage an alert when it first comes in\n\n• What logs you check first (EDR, firewall, auth, DNS, etc.)\n\n• How you decide if it’s false positive vs real incident\n\n• What questions you ask yourself while investigating\n\n• How you document or escalate\n\nI’m not asking for any company-specific or confidential info — just the mental workflow and skills you use daily.\n\nWould love to learn how professionals approach this in practice.

Clearly not a SQL injection attempt, and the alert did a lazy keyword match on UNION. (Sufficiency: SQL keyword is present, but no additional SQL to attempt to abuse a vulnerability or join additional records).\n\nOn the other hand, when your EDR pops some weird activity, you may be checking executable hashes vs virustotal for reputation, reviewing the assigned group membership of the executing user, running strings against the binary, researching the software developer based on metadata, and reviewing what controls are applied to systems via GPO.",

SOAR is basically codified experience from senior analysts. The mental workflow you're asking about still happens, it just got automated for the common stuff.\n\nWhat's shifting now is AI agents handling the alerts that don't fit a playbook. The investigation loop you're describing (pull logs, check user history, compare to baseline, decide if it's noise) that's what LLMs are getting reasonably good at. When we test this sort of thing at Scanner, we often find that an AI can do that initial triage in seconds for alerts that would otherwise take 30-45 minutes of analyst time. Not perfectly, you still often need human review, but enough to change the math on how SOCs operate.\n\nFor entering the field, I'd still learn the fundamentals you're asking about. Understanding what normal looks like, knowing which log sources to correlate, building intuition for suspicious patterns. That stuff matters because you'll need it to supervise and correct the AI, and to handle the cases it gets wrong. But the day-to-day is moving toward reviewing AI assessments and focusing on alerts that actually need human judgment, plus higher-leverage work like tuning detections and threat hunting.\n\nHonestly the teams I've talked to who are adopting this aren't replacing analysts. Instead, the AI agents are finally giving them bandwidth for the interesting work that was always getting deprioritized because the alert queue never ended",

This isn't ALWAYS the case. A high would be prioritized over a crit because the high is on a crown jewel system. This means business impact over the severity score always.\n\n• What logs you check first (EDR, firewall, auth, DNS, etc.)\n\nThe logs you check depend on what triggered. If its an email detection, obviously you're looking through email logs right? Ultimately, if you have an incident, you're looking at a SIEM anyway so all of the logs you listed would be right in front of you. Just go to the time frame the alert was set off and timeline everything together.\n\n• How you decide if it’s false positive vs real incident\n\nWell this depends on the detection... An example of an FP that stills require investigation is Betty from Finance typing whoami in cmd because IT told her to.\n\nAn example of a true positive (TP) is Betty logs into the corp VPN from Bulgaria at 3am on a Saturday (Betty lives in Texas, is very old, and needs her sleep).\n\n• What questions you ask yourself while investigating\n\nAsk yourself: Is it a FP or TP? When did it happen? What happened? Where did they go/touch? How did they get in? Who was it? Depending on the detection, this is not in any particular order. You might ask who first you might ask when first.\n\n• How you document or escalate\n\nMost of the time, you want to document the questions I posted above. Depending on if you're at an MSP, Tier 1 SOC, or IR (Tier 2-3+), the level of detail differs a little. IR would generally give WAY more detail than your average MSP.\n\nSource: I'm not saying this is how my company operates, but this is generally what I've seen and know for sure based off experience.\n\nI'm on the on-call rotation as an IC at an F50 so I'm sharing this to give you perspective.",

It feels more like the government saying: breaches are going to happen, so organisations need to stop pretending they won’t and actually be ready for it.\n\nWhat caught my eye is that it doesn’t just seem aimed at IT teams. A lot of the responsibility looks like it’s being pushed higher up — leadership, boards, the organisation as a whole. Also feels like supply chains and third-party risk are way more in scope than before, which makes me think a lot of smaller companies are going to feel this even if they’re not directly regulated.\n\nI’m trying to work out how this plays out in the real world though.\n\nDo people think this will actually be enforced in a meaningful way, or does it end up as another compliance exercise?  \nDoes this finally make cyber risk a board-level issue, or will it still get parked with IT?  \nAnd are SMEs and suppliers even ready for the knock-on effects?\n\nGenuinely curious what people think, especially anyone in security, IT, legal, or leadership roles.  \nFeels like one of those things we’ll all start paying attention to once it starts causing pain.",

Most of what’s being discussed already exists in some form, but it usually lives too low in the org to drive real change. Once accountability is explicit at leadership level, security stops being an “IT problem” and starts being a business risk that needs ongoing attention.\n\nThe harder part won’t be initial compliance, it’ll be sustaining it. Continuous exercises, supplier oversight, incident reporting, and board-level visibility all create operational drag, especially for smaller orgs. Even companies technically “out of scope” will feel it through customer and insurer pressure. In practice, this feels less like a new rulebook and more like another step toward resilience becoming a standing management discipline rather than a one-off compliance project.",

We process card transactions for other businesses, so outages immediately hit revenue and compliance nerves at the same time. The incident response bridge was opened when a supplier that handles part of our transaction routing began timing out during peak volume.\n\nAt the beginning it was framed as an availability issue, with transactions backing up and pressure building to provide a clear restoration timeline to the business. I joined because the integration touches regulated data, but the expectation was still that security would stay in the background unless something obviously malicious surfaced.\n\nAbout half an hour in, while people were debating rollback options, I started looking at the logs we were sharing. The retry traffic looked wrong. Requests were hitting endpoints that are not part of the documented production path. The supplier kept repeating that nothing had changed and that they were failing over internally to keep service alive.\n\nWhat they did not mention until later was that the failover path routes through an older service we thought was decommissioned. It still worked, which is why no alarms fired, but it bypasses one of our monitoring layers and handles data differently. We never designed it to run under load, let alone during an incident.\n\nAt that point I said out loud that this stopped being a clean outage. The response was immediate pushback. Procurement jumped in to say the supplier had already been reviewed and approved. Someone referenced the third-party record and said Panorays showed no active issues, like that settled the question. The score had not changed, so in their minds the risk had not either.\n\nI am watching live traffic move through a path we do not actively control while the incident is still in progress and recovery speed has become the dominant concern. Everyone else wants to keep the scope narrow so the bridge can be closed and the issue treated as resolved. I am stuck trying to explain why a system behaving exactly as it was never meant to behave cannot just be dismissed as operational noise.\n\nHow do I push to reclassify this without being remembered as the person who delayed recovery and forced old approval decisions back into active dispute?",

          "text": "\"an older service we thought was decommissioned. It still worked\"...that right there would be considered a security incident, that's a huge change control failure.  You mentioned \"regulated data\", so if this data is now passing through a service that cannot legally support those regulatory requirements...really, this is out of your hands.  This is how I would frame it; this would be considered a data leak, or in more strict NIST 800-53 language an active \"information leakage\" event. Right now you should be preparing to contact whatever regulatory authorities are over this data, at a minimum you should file a report via CISA so you have a solid third-party evidence artifact.  At my workplace, I would be calling DC3 as it would be some CUI data flow going through a service that was never assessed or given ATO to handle that data.\n\nThe bad part: you will be remembered as the guy who delayed recovery, maybe.  Honestly, that is just part of the job of cyber security. We always make everything more complicated. My email signature is literally \"security is directly proportional to inconvenience\".  I am always that guy saying \"wait, not so fast, what about XYZ regulation?\" or \"that cloud vendor isn't FedRAMP so we can't send them that type of data\"...I've even argued with senior VIPS and pulled the whole \"if the company does X, that will border on potential wilful negligence that has actual criminal potential under DFARS\" and have had to stick to my guns. That VIP no longer works for my company, not because of that (probably? I didn't report them or anything but...) but this is the hard part of the job.  Or the fun part, depending on your personality LOL.\n\nBut you don't HAVE to delay anything; just keep record of the data leak; contact the appropriate regulatory authorities NOW, but let everyone else get it resolved. Let them know there WILL be an after-action report follow-up on this, and that the failures WILL be addressed and systems WILL be decommissioned. Use the power that comes from the regulations to push the needed fix; that's why they exist.  Remember, ALL REGULATIONS ARE WRITTEN IN BLOOD.  Something bad happened in the past, this regulation is part of the fix. Preserve your evidence. \n\nI would also say that something is amiss with the Panorays stuff.  I'm not familiar with it, but a system that was SUPPOSED to be decommissioned but wasn't and is now flowing regulated data should 100% be increasing whatever risk assessment system it uses.  If it's not, that means that probably it has ZERO visibility of the actual data flow path endpoints.",
