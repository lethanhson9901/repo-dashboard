Currently we manually sync branch “version/v4.5” while the big rework in “main” is still in development and will only be synced when it’s released.\n2. v4.5 only receives cosmetic changes and supporting libraries updates (which are pretty substantial though). The libraries that implement the actual app logic are SafariConverterLib, DnsLibs, AdguardAssistant. They are all also open source, available on Github, and used by many other ad blockers.\n\n>I learned that the way they fix up ads is by executing 20,000+ lines of javascript on EVERY SINGLE WEBSITE you load\n\nI wouldn’t agree with the exact number of lines, but yes, modern ad blocking requires executing a lot of JavaScript.\n\n>I kept digging and learned that Adguard is registered in Cyprus but all the developers live in Moscow.\n\nThat’s simply not true. After 2022 a large part of the team was relocated and nowadays, most of the team does not live there, especially key personnel.   \nThat said, there is no “ban” on ru. Moreover, since this is open source, we will be happy to have contributions from anywhere, be it Russia, US, China, etc.\n\n",

          "text": "The 20K lines of injected code is concerning but it's worth understanding the mechanics here. iOS content blockers (the 'good' kind) use the Content Blocker extension API which works declaratively — you give Safari a JSON list of rules, and Safari does the blocking itself. The extension never sees your traffic.\n\nBut Safari Web Extensions (which AdGuard also uses for its advanced features) get much deeper access. They can inject arbitrary JavaScript into every page you visit via content scripts. That's where the 20K lines comes in — it's not just filtering rules, it's active code running in your browser context.\n\nThe real risk vector is that this injected JS has access to the DOM of every page you visit. In theory it could read form inputs, modify page content, or exfiltrate data. Whether it does or doesn't today, you're essentially trusting a third party with the same level of access that a malicious browser extension would have.\n\nIf you want to audit what's actually happening, you can:\n1. Enable Safari Web Inspector (Settings > Safari > Advanced)\n2. Connect to your Mac and inspect Safari on the device\n3. Look at the injected content scripts under the Sources tab\n4. Monitor network requests coming from the extension context\n\nThe broader issue is that the App Store review process for Safari extensions doesn't deeply audit injected JavaScript. Apple reviews the extension manifest and basic behavior, but the actual JS code running in your browser gets minimal scrutiny compared to native app code.",

      "text": "Hey all, stumbled across something odd while digging into the Epstein DOJ releases.\n\nThe file EFTA01133110.pdf (from Data Set 9, the one with the raw meat slabs photo in a freezer that got pulled pretty quick) has this SHA-256 hash:\n\nbbbe03b56d9e47fdc5ffeb73a5c50a70e694af12f14566075fa283fb61fc7ee4\n\nI ran it on VirusTotal (public page: [ https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bbbe03b56d9e47fdc5ffeb73a5c50a70e694af12f14566075fa283fb61fc7ee4/behavior ](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bbbe03b56d9e47fdc5ffeb73a5c50a70e694af12f14566075fa283fb61fc7ee4/behavior))\n\n•  Static detections: 0/XX – totally clean on AV side.\n\n•  But the Behavior tab (sandboxes like CAPE, Jujubox, Zenbox) shows a bunch of red flags:\n\n•  Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203) + Process Injection (T1055)\n\n•  Anti-analysis stuff: IsDebuggerPresent, Sleep calls, GetTickCount/GetTickCount64 timing checks\n\n•  Drops temp files/logs/JS-related items, weird registry mods (mostly Adobe/Office paths), spawns Acrobat crash processors + system stuff like svchost/dllhost\n\n•  Network to adobe.com/Akamai/MSN domains (legit-looking but in context…)\n\n•  Mutexes like “Global\\\\\\\\AdobeCrashProcessor ocall\\\\\\_owl\\\\\\_ork” and “Global\\\\\\\\ARM Update Mutex”\n\nHighlighted text in sandbox: “EFTA01133110.pdf - Adobe Acrobat Reader (32-bit)”, dimensions like “1.488 x 20.28 in” at 319% zoom – clearly it’s rendering that meat photo.\n\nFrom what I read, the photo is just big steaks on a tray in a kitchen/freezer setup (people say it’s beef, maybe from Epstein’s properties?), but the PDF itself behaves like it has some exploit code or malformed junk that trips sandboxes.\n\nAnyone else upload/analyze this one? Is it just Adobe Reader being weird in VMs (font handling, crash reporting, etc.), or could the file have been tampered with before upload? Or maybe a false positive from how evidence photos get scanned/embedded?\n\nNot claiming it’s malware – just weird that a “simple photo PDF” from official DOJ drops looks like this dynamically. Thoughts?\n\n[Source file](https://filebin.net/5yo5jl18d97uo7uv)",

Now it processes network-originated data and apparently passes\n\n  unsanitized input to system commands somewhere in that pipeline.\n\n\n\n  There's already a public PoC floating around, so patch ASAP.

Instead, it makes use of ordinary WiFi devices already communicating with each other nearby. As radio waves move through a space and interact with people, they create distinctive patterns that can be captured and analyzed. These patterns are comparable to images produced by cameras, but they are formed using radio signals rather than light. The research team argues that this emerging capability highlights the urgent need for stronger privacy protections.",

So… we’re polishing the same turd, just with a bigger GPU.\n\nWhat I *have not* heard\n\n“Here’s how we get in front of adversaries and make them bleed time/money.”\n\n“Here’s a new defense-in-depth model where hunting is built-in, not a vibes-based afterthought.”\n\n“Here’s how we make attackers’ iteration loop slower than ours.”\n\nInstead it’s: make your silo shinier. Make your dashboard calmer. Make your weekly metrics prettier. (make me look better!)\n\nAnd if you’ve ever been hired to “combat threat actors across the whole company,” you know the brick wall - we all hit it head first\n\nSo the org keeps doing what it can measure today: more triage, better filtering, fancier scoring.\n\nAI could actually break the wall.

These companies are trying to productize what in-house security teams build out at high talent density tech companies in the Bay Area, and try to sell it to non-tech companies. But the gap is still human ability - the people at the non-tech companies don't have sufficient ability to properly deploy and use the tools like the people at Anthropic using their own product, Claude, do.

It's always dogshit. It's usually not accurate, but like every 10th prompt or so it gives me a paragraph or two that's fairly solid that I leverage... but reallistically what did it help me do? Very little. Could I have come up with the content I DO use from it? Absolutely. In most instances, I've just wasted time trying to get it to output what I want instead of just actually DOING the work. Add to that the fact that in the 10 minutes I wasted fucking around with it, I probably just did the equivalent of burning an acre of tires, its almost completely useless. \n\nSo tired of AI in everything.",

The signal-to-noise ratio on most SIEM alerts is so bad that even a good model just learns to replicate the same fatigue.\n\nWhere I have seen it actually work well is in mobile/application security testing -- specifically in automating the exploratory phase. Dynamic analysis of a mobile app requires navigating through authentication flows, triggering edge cases, testing how the app reacts to a modified environment, and correlating runtime behavior with static findings. That workflow maps well to an agent-based approach because the LLM can reason about what it is observing (e.g. \"the app crashed when I toggled this setting, let me check the logs and try to reproduce with instrumentation\"). The feedback loop is tight and the action space is constrained enough to be useful.\n\nThe actual turd polishing IMO is: AI-generated compliance reports, AI vulnerability descriptions that just rephrase the CVE text, and any product that claims to \"autonomously remediate\" findings by generating code patches. The liability alone makes that a non-starter for anything serious.\n\nThe real question is whether AI gets good enough at reasoning about program behavior to find novel vulnerabilities. Current models can identify known bad patterns, but finding a new logic bug in auth flow requires understanding developer intent vs actual behavior. That is still very much a human skill.",

During the week, I select one major incident or research report and study it in depth to understand the attack chain and defensive lessons. I also rely on a well curated RSS feed and a few trusted practitioners for analysis instead of headlines. This approach keeps me informed, focused on real world risk, and free from information overload.\nAlso I am trying ChatGPT Agent to stay updated by asking it to monitor specific cybersecurity topics, CVEs, vendors, or threat actors and provide concise summaries on demand.",

Takes longer to load, more resource heavy. Just need something simple for day-to-day stuff.\n\nFor those who already made the switch - what are you using now that's actually comparable? Need something lightweight that doesn't slow down basic tasks.\n\nAny suggestions?",

What’s worrying isn’t just the number (any internet-facing service without proper controls is going to be exposed) but the fact that many of these agents appear to be running with excessive privileges and weak (or no) authentication controls.\nFrom a risk and operational security standpoint, there are a few fundamentals that shouldn’t be optional:\n1. Clear inventory and classification of what these agents can access (data, systems, credentials).\n2.Least privilege + Zero Trust principles: agents should only have the minimum permissions required, with strong authentication and network segmentation.\n3. Continuous monitoring of agent behavior, because autonomous systems can be manipulated into performing unintended actions.\nAI adoption can absolutely drive efficiency. But without governance and proper hardening, these systems quickly become high-value attack surfaces.",

We'll either adapt some shit from China, or have \"Digitally Sovereign\" alternatives to the exact same idea as what Elon Musk is doing.

Hell, they have staff who've leaked logs before.\n\nChina has been selling its GFW technology for quite a while now and going through brokers in the EU to do it. I'm sure we'll see it soon enough in Europe. Personally, I'm hoping for hand-rolled solutions (as the best case worst case scenario) because I don't think my government (UK) in its present state is capable of creating anything as difficult to work around as the GFW (which had a huge headstart, co-evolved with the web, and has decades of iterative upgrades and real-world pen testing).\n\nI do find it tragicomic that people saw - and largely still see - internet censorship as \"that thing that happens in China and third-world dictatorships\" without recognising that the West (esp. Europe) has been creeping in that direction for 15 years now and rapidly accelerating. Now that people can't access sites as innocuous, even vacuous, as Imgur in the UK, they're starting to wake up to it. I find myself saying, \"Yes, that's the OSA you were so excited about and never read. Thanks.\"\n\nBTW, where's the source on Musk/X performing that function in the US? In much of Europe, it often seems to many people like he's providing the mainstream bulwark against the OSA/DSA/etc. Personally, I'm wishing Wyoming the best with its plan to become the anti-OSA state. The law's drafters say that it'll free the net for the entire world due to their resistance to pressure from all other nation states, though it remains to be seen if they can do that. If it's more than mere bluster, it could be exciting for everyone.",

Either way, it's not something that engenders trust in the platform.\n\nThis brings into question other claims that Discord makes about their data handling. They claim they don't sell your data, but they could easily be providing it to companies or governments anyway. I don't want Palantir getting my facial scan and being able to correlate my online activity with my government identity.

Everything you do after you authenticate to Discord is likely being tracked and correlated by third-party data brokers, who sell to anyone with enough money. If you sign in to any other services or forgot to disable any already-signed-in services (e.g., you left Steam running, your email is open, you decide to play Roblox or whatever you kids play), you are immediately tying that identity and all information around it to your Discord account, de-anonymizing yourself. You are not \"Abe Froman\". You are the person they watch, who is pretending to be \"Abe Froman\", for some weird reason.\n\nThis is not unique to or uniquely concerning Discord - nearly every modern application and website you use enables this.\n\nThere are so many other layers to this problem of remaining truly anonymous on the Internet, that the average, non-nation-state would not only find it impractical and inconvenient to do every time they want to use the Internet, but can't even afford or technically accomplish.",

What is the target context of the remote code execution?\n\nThe malicious code would execute in the security context of the user who opened the Markdown file, giving the attacker the same permissions as that user.\n```",

Hopefully your company has good documentation, if they already have established SOC playbooks, SOPs, etc, start by reviewing those. You should at least know which playbook to execute when. Build the bigger picture from there with your team's Security Incident Response plan, and then your company's overall Incident Response plan.\n\nYour manager probably has specific skills that he will want you to develop, maybe even a whole training plan already created. If he leaves it open to you, there's really two paths you can choose. Hands-on virtual labs like Let's Defend or THM/HTB SOC learning paths.

Write down what you do and what you learned.  This can be on a blog or github or postbin or something.  But make sure you document your journey.  Then see if you can find a local security group.  There are many local DEFCON groups (Named DC, followed by your area code, like DC865).

The updated site, clean patterns, and that self-assessment tool are all super helpful especially for lean teams trying to get ahead of compliance before deals heat up.\n\nWould be great to see something on OT/IT convergence. A lot of organisations still juggle hybrid infrastructure with weird legacy constraints, and mapping cleanly to NIST in that context isn’t always straightforward. Also seconding more depth on AI/ML supply chain stuff. Things like model drift, poisoned datasets, or tracking fine-tuned weights could really use clearer control guidance.\n\nWhat’s the best way to suggest new patterns? GitHub issue or is there a public board you’re tracking?",

We actually have an existing Industrial Automation pattern from the original library but it needs serious modernisation -- the convergence problem has changed completely since it was written. IEC 62443 mapping, Purdue model erosion, cloud-connected SCADA -- all need proper treatment. That'll likely be one of the next patterns we tackle.\n\nOn AI/ML supply chain -- SP-027 covers AI integration at the architecture level but you're right that model provenance, training data integrity, and drift detection deserve their own dedicated pattern. The supply chain angle is different enough from the integration angle that it probably warrants a standalone pattern rather than trying to cram it into SP-027.\n\nFor suggesting patterns, GitHub issues on osa-data works well (github.com/opensecurityarchitecture/osa-data). But honestly threads like this work too -- we're tracking all the feedback.\n\nCheers, Russ",

A few reasons: First, the sheer number of lines of code is constantly growing. Second, there will always be new computing paradigms that need to be figured out (to name a few hot topics: edge device security, Zero Trust, Operational Technology), which means \"moving target,\" which means, \"needs security professionals.\" Third, AI is always going to be fallible and incomplete and need humans to supplement it. Incidentally, a fully automated 100% correct catch-all bug-finding program is impossible by Rice's theorem. It's my belief, if not a fact, that this implies AI security tools will always require human guidance at a minimum. Fourth, it's entirely possible the next global war (God forbid) will involve true \"I'm going to shut off your power grid\" cyber warfare. This is actually a terrifying thought if you consider it seriously, but I think you will see and are seeing more people take this seriously. The more governments take this seriously, the more they will mandate security standards in law, and the migrations involved will require big teams of skilled people.  \nMaybe none of this speaks to your question about pen-testing specifically, but like I said: long-term, the cybersecurity career in general will not go away.",

                  "text": "I'll try to be more precise: I don't think a computer can faithfully emulate a human brain (that's the part covered under \"It's my belief.\") Two separate points here. First, even if it could do it purely theoretically and incredibly slowly, the absolute numbers matter. If simulating a human brain requires the power of 1,000 suns, then that effectively prevents a computer from doing the same things a human can within a Type I civilization on the Kardashev scale. Second, my personal belief is that human cognition isn't strictly computable. I haven't tried to fully formalize this part, but to a first approximation, suppose humans have access to a \"silly goose\" oracle that almost always generates noise, but sometimes generates astonishingly useful bits of information. Say, bits that encode the set of halting TMs. There are conditions you can set on this (I don't have them off the top of my head) that would escape computability, and in my view correspond to the viewpoint that \"humans sometimes have access to true inspiration that can't be understood computably.\"\n\nFor this type of noisy oracle, there is a classic argument that you could repeatedly run the TM+oracle combination until you have enough information to solve the halting problem with 99.999% probability or some such. But, you can't just \"run\" a real human brain a billion times, at least not very quickly, so this doesn't mean would could solve the halting problem in practice. Well, now suppose we find out that this allegedly divine inspiration actually has some kind of actual quantum-mechanical randomness explanation somewhere deep inside neurons that we don't fully understand, but plausibly could understand one day, meaning it's not a true noisy oracle, just a useful but computable heuristic that uses random bits to navigate a massive search space. That still leaves the possibility that to effectively simulate that physical process, we could need enormous computing power we couldn't actually obtain unless we had access to more liquid helium that we could ever harvest on Earth, or some type of yet unknown \"wet computer\" that isn't a human brain but faithfully computes the same physical (hypothetical) process inside neurons that some of us today call \"divine inspiration.\"\n\nI'm sorry this explanation isn't super precise and by its nature difficult to falsify. But there are certainly avenues by which a human brain could seem computable unless you look really, really closely.",

Most pentests are either simple, done poorly, or both.\n\nMost security vendors are never held accountable for doing subpar work, AI just allows them to continue doing subpar or simple work at greater efficiency by automating tasks like reporting and analyzing output of tools. They then claim they use AI as a sales tool, which is seen as a positive by those who don't know how it works. \n\nThe other issue being that technical people/engineers are looking at AI too closely and not from far enough back. They are right that technical expertise probably won't be replaced by AI, at any level, but it doesn't matter if it is or isn't. What matters is how the consumer perceives it. If all these companies keep promoting AI as fixing or optimizing security, most customers don't understand what the limits are, and they make purchasing decisions based on their inaccurate perception. In other words, it doesn't matter how good or bad it is technically, only how people perceive what it is capable of. This goes back decades long before AI and applies to basically every security tool sold since I started, it's just slightly worse now because it's wrapped up in a multi-industry trend. \n\nAI has been sold as a solution to a lot of problems. The customer is buying what is being sold because they don't know differently and are receiving it from a lot of directions. The end result being that pentesters will be replaced by AI, not because AI can do the work, but because there is little accountability for subpar work and using AI makes scaling a lot easier even if the results suck",

The faster you go, the less time you spend doing deep research to uncover the novel, high-impact issues that real threat actors are going to find. That loss of depth directly degrades quality, and quality is what actually determines whether a vulnerability gets resolved or quietly survives until it's exploited in the wild.\n\nQuality matters far more than speed or raw finding volume. A fast, high-volume engagement that misses the one exploit chain leading to a material breach is effectively worthless. A slower, high-quality test that prevents even a single serious incident will pay for itself many times over, a literal 12,000% ROI. The actual value of penetration testing is measured in the breaches that never happen because the right issues were found and fixed before a threat actor got there first.\n\nSpeed and quality are usually opposing forces, and volume and quality are different axes entirely. A bot can spit out 500 \"high severity\" findings overnight, but if half are duplicates, a third are noise, and none are tied to real kill chains in that specific environment, the value to the organization is low. A slower engagement that uncovers 5–10 solid, validated and chained attack paths with real impact on identity, data, and operations will do more to advance a security program than a 200 page mostly autogenerated report ever will.\n\nOn the \"gap is closing\" point... what's really happening is that a new class of tools is being marketed as if they perform \"full pentests,\" when in reality most are doing some combination of augmented scanning, assisted code review, or pattern-based bug hunting at scale. The marketing language and press releases compress that nuance and create the illusion that the work a seasoned human team does is being replicated. Under the hood, it's not even close.\n\nMy advice is that you don't frame this as \"AI vs. traditional pentesting.\" Traditional checklist pentesting and pure vulnerability scanning were always on borrowed time. What AI is really doing is  accelerating the death of low-quality, compliance-focused work (and by the way. compliance is the natural by product of doing it right). The smart path is to learn to do real offensive work by modeling threats, chaining issues, understanding identity, cloud, and AI stacks in depth. Use automation like LLMs, agents, scanners, custom scripts as power tools to increase efficiency and free up time for higher-order thinking. \n\nThose skills don't get obsoleted by the next model release. As more AI generated code and AI-assisted \"security\" hits production, the demand for people with real talent and expertise is going to increase, not disappear.",

Businesses are shipping faster, infrastructures are more dynamic and AI is accelerating everything. A once-a-year snapshot simply doesn’t reflect real risk anymore. The real shift is toward **continuous validation** instead of **periodic assessment**. Human expertise still matters a lot. But it needs to be supported by automation that keeps up with the speed of modern environments. It’s not the end of pentesting, just the end of treating security as a **checkbox exercise.**",

The testing tools still face difficulties in detecting business logic vulnerabilities and cloud-identity access management abuses and actual attack sequences and assessing their effects.\n\nAs market growing pentesting has changed its focus from discovering security weaknesses to understanding how attackers think best and how systems operate.\n\nIn my point of view next 10-20 months will show that focusing on cloud security and identity protection and application logic security and AI security will provide reliable results. The traditional pentesting method still exists but companies now require better skills to meet recent testing needs.",
