He currently serves as a Director at CrowdStrike following the sale of his company Iperlane in 2017. Vincenzo is also a Network Leader at Village Global, a seed stage VC fund based in Silicon Valley. In addition, Vincenzo is an Associate Researcher at the MIT Media Lab and serves as a committee member on the Black Hat Conference board. Vincenzo co-authored the “iOS Hacker’s Handbook” (Wiley, 2012) and was part of the winning teams that attacked Firefox, iOS and Blackberry OS at Pwn2Own between 2010-2012.\n\nhttps://cylonlab.com/mentors/vincenzo-iozzo/\n\n\nInteresting that this was from a confidential source that the FBI used more than once and is one of the few formerly classified released tip docs I’ve seen so far. That being said, it’s still not confirmed.",

We show an adversary can extract gigabytes of training data from open-source language models like Pythia or GPT-Neo, semi-open models like LLaMA or Falcon, and closed models like ChatGPT. Existing techniques from the literature suffice to attack unaligned models; in order to attack the aligned ChatGPT, we develop a new divergence attack that causes the model to diverge from its chatbot-style generations and emit training data at a rate 150x higher than when behaving properly. Our methods show practical attacks can recover far more data than previously thought, and reveal that current alignment techniques do not eliminate memorization.",

What to look out for:\n\n* gup.exe making network requests for other than: notepad-plus-plus.org, github.com and release-assets.githubusercontent.com.\n* gup.exe for unusual process subspawns — it should only spawn explorer.exe, and npp\\* themed Notepad++ installers. For 8.8.8 and 8.8.7 they should have valid digital signatures, and be signed by GlobalSign.\n* Files called update.exe or AutoUpdater.exe in user TEMP folder, where gup.exe has written and/or executed the files.\n* Use of curl.exe (bundled with Windows 10 and above) to call out to temp.sh for recon activity. [Example](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*c047T4mh0h5xOjl_ZiyL0A.png). You’ll notice AutoUpdater.exe — which isn’t a part of Notepad++, Notepad++ doesn’t use that filename at all — executing with the parameter /closeRunningNpp, which is called by the legit Notepad++ updater process — essentially, something else is in the update chain somehow in this example. The cause isn’t known in that case but it may be related to this blog.\n\nA more detailed report with [IOCs](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/#indicators-of-compromise-iocs-).",

What you might be thinking of is the avalanche effect, but it’s still only related to encryption. The fact that it’s just an encoding (and fairly efficient one) makes it possible.",

If you disable biometric unlock:\n\n\n\n1. You MUST use a strong passphrase (15+ chars, mixed case). A simple PIN can be brute-forced in seconds during custody.\n\n\n\n2. Consider enabling a \"Duress PIN\" feature if available (newer Android/iOS). This logs you in without alerting the device they cracked it.\n\n\n\n3. Backup authentication factors (security keys, TOTP apps) should be stored separately from your primary device.\n\n\n\n4. The WaPo case highlights law enforcement's legal uncertainty here - they used biometrics in a warrantless seizure, which may not hold up under 5th Amendment challenges (unlike passcodes, which courts treat differently).\n\n\n\nThe real security posture: Layered authentication + understanding your threat model. If LEA is your primary threat, yes disable biometrics. If it's account takeover, keep them enabled with strong backup auth.",

Drip-feed patches across M365 channels, leave Semi-Annual and deferred tenants exposed for weeks, then act shocked when APTs weaponize the diff. Click-to-Run fragmentation is a feature, not a bug yet it keeps enterprises paying while attackers feast on version skew.. lol\nTechnically speaking, this is the same old Office mess: RCE chains + MotW/Protected View bypasses, HTML/RTF abuse, preview-pane shenanigans, and legacy COM/MSDT attack surface that should’ve been ripped out years ago. “Recently patched” just means red teams already reversed it and threat actors are farming orgs that aren’t on Current Channel because downtime = money. Defender signatures don’t save you when the execution path is signed, trusted, and user-assisted by design.\nAnd yeah, it hits harder knowing this cash-printing monopoly happily takes government contracts while bankrolling and politically enabling genocide, then turns around and lectures customers about “shared responsibility.” Spare us. You can’t virtue-signal security while shipping a productivity suite that’s still one malformed document away from domain compromise.\nPatch fast, disable Office macros for real, enforce ASR rules, block child process spawning, and assume every Office file is hostile. Microsoft won’t fix the incentives — only admins cleaning up their mess will.\nDammn feels like i talked so much but would a thing be changed real soon? Not particularly no..",

It's whether they patched fast enough, and whether they have the telemetry to know if someone got in during the gap.",

If I see a password from a breach last year that looks like mYpa$$4work25! and it no longer works, chances are I change that 5 to a 6 and we're off to the races.\n\nRotation on a schedule also doesn't really address any real world issues. If you're breached, the damage is done within, at most, days. Swapping that password every 90 days to shut the door on them accomplishes essentially nothing, since permanency (if relevant) is far more likely to be accomplished by using my creds to install something that gives access, rather than repeated direct logins that an IPS might raise an eyebrow over. Rotate the password if there's reason to believe it's compromised, but not prophylactically.",

A lot of you are saying that that this is „old news“ - but from my understanding the big difference to the December reporting is that it was no attack via DNS/ISP with enormous manual effort but rather the NPP hosting infrastructure compromised for quite a long time.\n\nAre people still assuming that the victims were selectively targeted? I find it quite likely that a second wave could’ve been much broader.\n\nI see the rapid7 report mentioned often but even they are writing in their first few paragraphs that they were not able to determine the initial scope of infrastructure compromise. And the incident report from the NPP developer is vague at best.\n\nWhat are your actual strategies right now? With the info at hand we are looking at a full reinstall of clients using notepad++.\n\nEDIT: Does someone know the old hosting provider used by notepad++? We have a lot of update routines identified via our xdr and knowing what „legitimate“ would be really helpful.",

However, the attackers managed to maintain access to internal services until December 2025.\n\nReports indicate that the threat actors continuously changed server addresses to distribute malicious updates. In one of the campaigns, the actors caused the victim to download a malicious `.exe` file, which turned out to be an NSIS installer of approximately 1 MB named “Chrysalis.” Upon execution, the actor uses `cmd` and `curl` to send system information to the attackers. Chrysalis is a backdoor that executes several files in `%appdata%\\ProShow`; one of these corresponds to legitimate ProShow software, which is used to run the final payload.\n\nThe payload contains two shellcodes. One of them includes junk code; however, the second retrieves Metasploit, which then downloads a Cobalt Strike beacon designed to establish a connection with the threat actor’s Command and Control (C&C) server.\n\nIn another campaign, the attackers added several commands to gather information from the victim’s machine, such as `whoami`, `tasklist`, `systeminfo`, and `netstat`. In general, the campaigns show slight variations, such as the URL used to download the Chrysalis backdoor, its size, and the paths where executables are stored. However, their objective remains the same: to obtain Metasploit and download the Cobalt Strike beacon.",

But once you have given yourself a little time, pick yourself up, brush yourself off, and get back out there. \n\nRemember the guys we're defending against have bad days too.

Mine was blanking on basic SIEM correlation concepts during a senior engineer interview - stuff I literally did every day. Nerves are real.\n\nTwo things worth considering:\n\n1. The fact that you are discouraged means you actually care, which puts you ahead of a lot of people who coast. That feeling sucks right now but it is fuel if you channel it right.\n\n2. Coding assessments in security interviews are a weird filter. Most security engineers I have worked with are not developers - they are problem solvers who can script when needed. If this role requires heavy development, it might not be the right fit, and that is okay. If they are just using it as a general filter, that is a sign the hiring process is broken, not that you are broken.\n\nPractical suggestion: take note of every question you stumbled on and spend the next two weeks filling those specific gaps. Not generic \"study more\" but targeted practice on exactly where you fell short. That turns a bad interview into a free assessment of what to work on next.\n\nFour years in this field is solid.

I work as an individual contributor reporting directly to the CISO though my tasks require me to work a lot cross-functionally with other team members.\n\nI accomplished a lot with our previous CISO before he left the company mid last year. Then around 6 months ago, a new chief came in. It turns out that he was previously a CISO of one of the largest fintech companies globally which I'm sure everyone here has heard of. Apparently, the CEO knew him when they worked together in the previous conpany.\n\nWe worked in different regional offices and barely spoke in the first 2-3 months despite me actively reaching out to him several times. He didn't set any weekly meetings with me or the broader team, nor he even tried to understand what my tasks were and learn about the current state of things.\n\nOftentimes, I would DM him to get an approval or an update, but he wouldn't respond until a day or two. He would just reply 'OK' or totally ignore my messages. Naturally, I was pissed but I just continued my daily BAU tasks.\n\nHe's Chinese (which I don't speak), but he understood and spoke English well enough on a conversational level.\n\nAround 3 months in, he started becoming a bit more active. We started having weekly updates with him, however, he also asked me and his other direct reports to report directly to the president. He let us do the updates on our own per team and sometimes he wouldn't speak a single word throughout the call. This pissed a lot of us since we all understood that it should be his job as CISO. All directives came from the president and he never started any initiatives on his own. Basically, he just let us do whatever we want.\n\nAt the start of the year, the audit from our regulator began. Our team was asked to do an overview presentation and he asked us to fill in the slides though the auditor required that it should be him to present it. All he had to do was understand and explain the slides.\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon before the presentation, he sent a group message to all us his direct reports that we should do a write up for him on the slides and we should complete it before the day ends so he can review it (mind you, the presentation was still on Wednesday). I was in utter disbelief when I read this. I was out with my family at the time and won't be back until after dinner. Of course, the rest of the team and I did it for him.\n\nOn the day of the presentation, I was sitting in the office room together with our regulators. He was put on call as he was allowed to do it remotely. To no surprise, he read the write-up word per word like an AI voice-over. It was painfully obvious for everyone in the room, but since we're behind schedule, they just let him be. I could've summarized and explained all the slides by heart.\n\nTo this day, I don't think he understands what the team is doing. They say a CISO's first 100 days should be enough to build a roadmap for the team. We're way past that and we're still nowhere near any semblance of one, and my colleagues already started leaving one by one.\n\nThat's all he is to me -- a decorative wallflower.\n\nAny ideas on how to deal with this situation?",

Use that for when you get around to the documentation in the year 2099 or later this week when your boss asks about it. \n\n4. Give yourself time away from computers.

          "text": "I have ADHD and I absolutely excel in Cybersecurity.\n\nHowever, I am very well aware of what I need, what I cannot handle well and what will be damaging to me and my ability to work.\n\nNonetheless, I can list some typical happenings which require some executive functions - and you can see for yourself if they would be problematic \n\nThe best thing I can recommend in the work context considering \"what helped me\" is being honest with yourself, being honest enough with bosses and colleagues and build external structures where your internal structures are lacking.\nThe best thing in general is regularly evaluating medication and coaching or behavioural therapy to deliver workplace specific skill/toolsets when you find yourself running out of ideas.\n\nCybersecurity aspects with heavy executive functioning:\n\n- Task and environment switching; many roles require you to shift gears fast and potentially often - even in tasks you switch from analysis, to documentation, to reaction, back to analysis, then to social exchange \n\n- Emotionally loaded interactions - people will tell you (in friendly words) you're stupid, overly cautious or similar. In any job they will often be annoyed when you want something. If you do anything around incidents stress is high, sometimes also other emotions\n\n- Time restrictions; time blindness can be problematic in the sense that timeframes for reactions or communications can be short/exist even when diving in, it can also get problematic because a lot of task run longer and still can't be forgotten or need checking in. The first is more typical in anything with incidents, the latter more with engineering or policies \n\n- Completion / following through: connects to task switching, but there often are lose ends to tie which are not NECESSARILY required anymore. (Which is why I personally like playbooks or templates with steps)\n\n- Task organisation: There is a lot of smaller things to do, things that need to be done regularly but not often, and tasks broken between different systems - keeping track can be hard\n\n- Memory is often relevant: working memory can be crucial when doing incidents, knowing where everything is written is relevant, knowing policies can be important, and often meetings will not have protocols but need to be taken in.\n\n- Planning and prioritisation are often central parts of tasks - more relevant the more one goes IR / direct reaction (I think) \n\n- Appointments - the more you mesh with other departments, the more often this will be relevant\n\n- Demanding work environment - a lot of work in Cybersecurity has a lot of demands or stress. As self-assessment can be hard with ADHD, risk of burnout or accepting bad environments for too long are very real. The work also often does not naturally allow break at clever times, but god damn especially ADHD needs them \n\n- Documentation requirements: documentation is way more boring then IR (or even architecture etc). It's very required. That can be hard.\n\n- Overload: adjacent to task organisation - often enough one has a lot of, sometimes really different, tasks in cybersecurity. Even if you know them all, it can be overwhelming to see them and lead to not starting any\n\n- Content planning / creation: god it can be so freaking hard to get your non-linear thinking to words which work for linear thinking colleagues (be it your team or people in other departments)\n\n- Noise: the exact kind of noise depends highly on your work place, but there are so many chances for it: alerts, too many tools, so so many mails, noisy office spaces due to e.g. others in meetings, visual noise with tooling. It's good to know what you can and cannot tolerate\n\n- having to step back: continuous necessity in so many jobs in Cybersecurity - but at the same time usually requires when nearly in the middle of the deep dive. That's hard.\n\n- Sometimes it can feel like \"it\" never ends: many cybersecurity jobs are continuous - and require parallel work on more than one thing. So even when you finish something, it can be hard to actually feel the accomplishment\n\n- Clearing up a setup, technical debt etc needs to happen \"in between\". Similar to tidying up at home - similarly potentially difficult",

My ADHD diagnosis came with a prescription for Adderall and taking it has been life changing. But, I was still easily overwhelmed and highly anxious. Sometimes I could focus but it wasn’t consistent. I recently discovered that SSRIs and Adderall work on the same receptors and the combination can heighten anxiety and lead to intense feelings of being overwhelmed. I talked to my Pharmacist and PCP and both said to taper off the SSRI. Since doing that, I am no longer anxious or overwhelmed and my brain is working like I thought it never would again.

Not only that but I often see things other people don't and I can keep multiple trains of thought going at the same time, so long as they're related to the thing I'm currently working on, it's like my brain is automatically tracing the path through 50 different mazes at the same time when I'm trying to solve a problem.\n\nHowever, if you don't have strong leadership with clear direction, it can be extremely easy to fall into task paralysis.   If there's a clear problem that needs solving, i.e an incident, or a complex problem, I can literally spend my whole shift glued to my screen, completing work that takes most other people days to work through.\n\nI think the most critical thing that has made my work life infinitely easier is a simple notepad and pen.   I've got the left page intentionally blank for random notes, shit I need to jot down so I don't forget but has no direct relation to clearly defined tasks, followups I need to do that have ambiguous actions required etc, then the right page is always ruled, dated, and has the SPECIFIC tasks I need to complete for that day, along with any notes from meetings or instructions/guidance given.   That way I'm always able to refer back to a specific day and know exactly what happened and the context in which it was in, and at the end of each week, I flick through the last few pages over notes which cements it all in my long term memory.\n\nI strongly advise against using note taking APPs, because it's digital it's very easy as someone with ADHD to just forget it's there, a physical notepad doesn't have that problem, it's always in eyesight, and you have to physically manipulate it to do anything with it (which helps build more neural connections to solidify the memory).  But one type of app I will recommend that many companies use anyway, is some form of task board like [monday.com](http://monday.com) or Jira.  The main advantage of this is being able to copy paste important information, conversations, screenshots, URLs, hyperlink relevant documents, and share that information easily with others.",
