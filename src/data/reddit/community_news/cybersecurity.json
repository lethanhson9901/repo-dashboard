Also, doesn't sound like there's going to be any formal seating, so have fun holding your laptop up while you're standing in a crowd. \n\nMy real answer: they probably don't want any amateurs being disruptive with electronic devices there that they can't track down. Normal cell phones can be tracked and identified. They could never stop an actual attacker with proper covert gear, but they can stop a bunch of children from DoS'ing equipment and being annoying.",

The political atmosphere around this election was charged to say the least, and it stands to reason that Mamdani’s inauguration could be a more interesting target for disruption than others. From the perspective of a naïve event coordinator, banning devices like F0 takes little effort and appears to have the effect of removing a large amount of possible disruptions, regardless of the reality that almost no one in any random crowd of 10,000 would ever have such a device with them. Unfortunately, like you said, it also doesn’t stop someone with actual ill intent.",

E.g., while you might run a little home lab or mini K8s server at home on your RPi, there's very few reasons you would need to bring a RPi with you into a convention center for a political event.",

It's much the same reason that if you try to fly into Germany with a pineapple they'll arrest your ass. \n\nYeah sure you could set up Kali or have a phone with net-hunter but that requires a degree more competence to do, where as the things the flipper zero can do with very little training make it a dangerous tool in the hands of children.",

It is questionable to claim it validated a continental system collapse.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. has been using similar electrical system blackouts in similar situations since at least the Korean War. Forcing air defense and other adversary forces to switch off the main grid has numerous advantages to the attacker. I don’t have any evidence that anything nuclear nor exotic was used in Caracas.

It's often easier to simply walk into substations and destroy some capacitors.\n\nI've traditionally interpreted claims like this more as a PR stunt to sow FUD. It is theoretically possible, but low probability and likely not the most effective tool at your disposal if you're actually seeking to cause a blackout. What if the cyber attack had failed? Why not use the military to walk in and trigger the isolators, or blow it up? Kinetic options were definitely on the table here!",

      "text": "I've spent the last decade in incident response, working across everything from 5-person joinery shops to multi-national retail enterprises. After cleaning up roughly 1,000 incidents, I naturally developed a bit of an intuition for knowing the difference between \"good security\" and \"good control coverage\".\n\nThe firms that survive incidents (and prevent them) are almost never the ones with the most tools or the biggest budgets. They were the ones who understood their resilience - where they'd actually break under pressure, and what that would cost them.\n\nA few things I've learned that changed how I approach assessments:\n\n**1. Compliance framing creates false confidence**\n\nCyber Essentials, SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc - you must understand that their sole purpose is to make it easier to do business with other companies. Executives sponsor these programmes because it will make them more money.\n\nThat might be by making their onboarding quicker, or shortening deal cycles when responding to RFPs, or just increasing consumer confidence.\n\nNone of it actually helps an organisation be more secure. At the best, I think it's fair to say that there's a small correlation between certifications and resilience, but it's absolutely not a casual relationship, just a pattern.\n\n**2. Clients respond to money, not maturity scores**\n\nNobody outside of security knows what \"Level 3 maturity\" means. But say \"you have a high insolvency risk from a major incident\" and suddenly you've got board-level attention. I frame all my assessments this way, even for small businesses.\n\nThe key principle to consider is that security programmes cost money. And for any commercial venture, money MUST provide a return on investment. If your recommendations don't make your client more money then they cost, why would they do it? I've known many enterprises that simply accept that they will have a major incident every 1-2 years, because the cost of transforming their security architecture would cost more than the impact of the incidents.\n\nThis is a totally valid position! And if you can help your client weigh up exactly what the pros and cons are, then you will quickly become one of their most trusted and valuable partners.\n\nThe trick, of course, is having the data and vocabulary to model the commercial implications.\n\n**3. The \"time to low risk\" metric changes the conversation**\n\nExecutive audiences don't understand CVSS scores, and are not going to read your 47 technical findings. Include them for context and for technical readers, but stick them in an appendix, and instead, lead with the programme required to get from their current state into an acceptable state.\n\nHow many months will it take? How much will it cost? Who will do the work? How do they measure success?\n\nThis completely changes the conversation, and transforms a scary report into an actionable project plan that your client will have confidence in sponsoring. You want your client to feel like they've been handed a solution, not a problem.\n\n**4. Periphery systems are where organisations actually die**\n\nCore infrastructure is usually fine - everyone's got M365, EDR, and MFA on their main systems now. If they've put one iota of effort into changing the defaults or have an MSP that does this for them, by and large they are in a great position.\n\nThe reason organisations like this still get hacked is because of the exceptions. Machines that don't have DfE on. Servers that have been missed from your asset register. An SSL VPN that no-one knew about.\n\nFixing these are often quick wins. Migrating might be a pain, but it's ultimately a short programme of work with a high reduction in risk.\n\n\\----\n\nI've put together a sample report that captures everything I've discussed above with a fictitious client. Here's the link: [https://analystengine.io/msp-assessment-sample](https://analystengine.io/msp-assessment-sample)\n\n**Transparent disclosure:** The site above does link to my cybersecurity startup focused on generating content like the above. That being said, the link above contains no CTA or sales material. I'm making the sample freely available as a resource for others to use how they see fit - and have added the required corporate flair to this post.\n\nI would love any advice or feedback on the report structure if anyone has thoughts on how to improve it!\n\n\\----\n\nEDIT: Overwhelmed with all the support this post got! For those asking for follow-up materials and my playbook for delivering cybersecurity assessments, I've typed it all up here: [How to deliver cybersecurity assessments](https://www.analystengine.io/how-to-deliver-cybersecurity-assessments?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=cybersecurity)\n\nI've included lots of resources, including the sample questionnaire I use for all new engagements, and a checklist of items to go through during your technical interviews. Good luck with your engagements!",

          "text": "Nice stuff there. For the GRC compliance issue in general, related to maturity levels, it really depends on the enterprise's tenor. Some enterprises really want to be more secure, in which case GRC efforts provide a roadmap and a yardstick for measuring progress. What most enterprises wish for, however, is a checkmark as a sales qualification, so they can sell into specific markets where security is a concern. For example, I can't tell you how many companies might say, \"We'll buy from you, but you need your SOC 2\" for enterprises where a SOC 2 isn't even appropriate, or they don't understand the difference between a SOC 2 Type I and II. Still, they will take a well-documented list of security controls over adequate security.",

If it is for SMB, then stuff like software developent will most likely not be an item. I like the control assessment, compliance (if it applies), and findings section. But idk.. on the whole it seems very long and too wordy. In my experience SMB dont have the attention span for most of this stuff. Great as a deliverable if your trying to demonstrate value with a very long document, but how useful is it is what I always ask myself. How does any of this translate to the client to take action on? Feel free to disagree, but thats just my initial take.",

Most of the time the SMB is just the owner that doesnt really know what to do, so they hire the MSP to do this stuff. So, if the context is that you are the MSP doing a security evaluation, then a lot of this seems kinda unnecessary. Like, you are reporting to the owner on your own security work, etc. - and that could be drastically summarized in my opinion.   \nOtherwise, I'd ask who is this meant for? An IT manager, the owner? or the MSP if you are just the external security evaluator/auditor?    \nWhat is the high level overview of the findings, and some details on each category evaluated - then maybe some technical stuff to help guide whoever might actually implement changes/fixes. The rest seems like fluff that I wouldn't expect anyone to read and seems to bog down the report.",

Here's your report.\n\nClient: Thanks! Now, what's our biggest risk?\n\nMe: ... we haven't done a risk assessment. I can tell you what services you provide and how they compare to what your competitors are doing. But risk is not addressed by NIST CSF.\n\nClient: So what have I paid for then?!\n\nThe security domains I've included in this sample (SecOps, Resilience, Growth) are all aligned/mapped to NIST in the backend. But especially for the SMB audience where the buyer is a little less mature, I think it's important we can go beyond service maturity and actually present improvement roadmaps aligned to risk - because really that's what they care about.\n\nPeople may disagree on that, and that's fair. It's just the position I've arrived at from dealing with buyers of these reports over the years.",

          "text": "Interesting post, says a lot of truisms but I’m not sure some of this is practical, I’ve got two comments: \n\n**Firstly on “talking money” in incident reports**\n\n> say “you have a high insolvency risk from a major incident” and suddenly you’ve got board-level attention. I frame all my assessments this way, even for small businesses.\n\n> The trick, of course, is having the data and vocabulary to model the commercial implications.\n\nYes, of course, dollar figures can raise urgency; but you talk about “modelling” risk in financial terms. Anyone who’s been through this exercise knows it’s an exercise in choosing which variables to multiply together. Very Often, in practice, best case is $0 and worst case is the sky has fallen. \n\nDay to day does this boil down to maturing finding severity ratings + canned copy in the report? \n\nIn my experience this requires more restraint be exercised than vocabulary. Very easy to scaremonger and kick up urgency. Not so easy to scale (aka show true granular relative risk and help the business to prioritise over time). \n\nLong story short: Talking “insolvency” or business outcomes with execs who (should) know 100x more than you about the business is a minefield, don’t you think? \n\n**secondly: on providing rich, end to end remediation plans to the business** \n\nThe “time to low risk” metric as you call it. Another no brainer: yes execs would love this - but how do you do it at scale? \n\nAs you describe incidents are rarely simple and can have many compound causes. \n\nYou have, say, 30 findings. Just to make up an example, they’re across: Appsec issues flagged by sast (plus some old ancillary risk for good measure), container rehydration issues with several modules, EOL components in use, legacy internally developed library dependencies flagged by sca, architecture review shows some red flags, auth is not blueprint standard but risk is unclear, an api not discovered by inventory, and to top it off external risk rating agencies are starting to ding you. (Now, your post talks about IR, but your template talks about general risk posture assessment. If it’s the latter I’ve kept things very very simple in this example). \n\nYou ask all the questions, like it’s a lack of business consideration that causes security to not hand this information over: \n\n> How many months will it take? How much will it cost? Who will do the work? How do they measure success?\n\nBut how do you, as cyber, answer them systematically before even issuing a report? Is that even possible for nontrivial orgs you are not embedded in (I mean, I’m sure there’s some people much smarter than me who could infer a tonne and get pretty far - but I assume this template is for the average responder?) \n\nAre just just giving generic canned solutions/plans to symptoms of generic problems? In which case the “actionable plan” sales pitch is a bit overhyped. \n\nAt scale: Answering these questions - actually answering them - is more work than responding to the incident in the first place. Much more work. Often it is also work that security absolutely cannot do in isolation - so you find yourself needing buy in from business long before you can give them these answers with any confidence at all. \n\nObviously an end to end project plan would be easier to action but if it was as simple as just doing that, it would be the default already.\n\n> You want your client to feel like they’ve been handed a solution, not a problem.\n\nYes obviously but the reason IR doesn’t hand the business fully fledged solutions on a silver platter are, in short, doing so scales very slowly and comes with many built in challenges.",

When we're dealing with security assessments, we only have several finite tools with which to deal with assessments of any kind.\n\n\\- We can look at control effectiveness  \n\\- We can look at service maturity  \n\\- We can look at governance  \n\\- We can look at risk\n\nEach of these domains is highly specalised, and with mature buyers like enterprises, they will almost always be very separate engagements with different stakeholders.\n\nBut for smaller organisations, it's impractical. So instead you have to squish multiple concepts together - because ultimately, what we want to do is best advise the organisation and ensure their business has strong margins (not weighed down by unnecessary cybersecurity cost centres) and can remain functional even if a disaster happened with their technology. That's the quintessence of our job.\n\nI accept basically all your points, I guess my only response is that we still have to do SOMETHING, and this is probably one of the best things you can do with the budget, resourcing, and buyer requirements that we most often have,",

SSL VPNs have seen some of the most 0day vulnerabilities on record, and these issues simply have not affected IPSEC implementations. \n\nHowever - in all the cases I’m aware of, adding MFA to the SSL VPN has been a mitigating measure. The vulnerabilities have only affected standard accounts with no second factor. This makes sense of course because your second factor will always involve a non-SSL identity component that’s much harder to spoof or break. \n\nThis means that the cheapest and most effective thing a client can do is just add MFA. Removing the implementation completely is a huge project and highly disruptive to working practices that are already comfortable with the current process. \n\nIn principle, I agree that IPSEC is the more secure implementation out of the two. But it doesn’t mean it’s the best advice to give a client if they’re stuck with an alternative solution.",

We have lost the internet, let’s be honest,” De Bruycker said. “If I want my information 100 per cent in the EU . . . keep on dreaming,” he added. “You’re setting an objective that is not realistic.”\n\nThe Belgian official warned that Europe’s [cyber defences](https://archive.ph/o/Z27fR/https://www.ft.com/cyber-security) depended on the co-operation of private companies, most of which are American. “In cyber space, everything is commercial. Everything is privately owned,” he said.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nEurope needed to build its own capabilities to strengthen innovation and security, said De Bruycker, adding that legislation such as the EU’s AI Act, which regulates the development of the fast-developing technology, was “blocking” innovation.\n\nHe suggested that EU governments should support private initiatives to build scale in areas such as cloud computing or digital identification technologies.\n\nIt could be similar to when European countries jointly set up the planemaker Airbus, he said: “Everybody was supporting the Airbus initiatives decades ago. We need the same initiative on \\[an\\] EU level in the cyber domain.”",

And they act to maintain the US owned walled gardens by preventing adversarial interoperability. Any real digital sovereignty seems impossible until we end these anti-circumvention laws.\n\nAcross the world, anti-circumvention laws could usually just be repealed at the national level, although some EU rules push them too, and must be repealed.\n\nEurope's only companies who profit from anti-circumvention laws should be treated as organized crime rings : Volkswagen and other car companies, who kill thouands via the diesel gate; Medtronic, whose vender lock-ins killed people by bricking ventilators during covid, Newag, whose vender lock-in makes repairing trains expensive and difficult.\n\n\\> *The Belgian official warned that Europe’s cyber defences depended on the co-operation of private companies, most of which are American.*\n\nYou cannot really buy \"cyber defence\" from any foreign company, not closed source tool anyways.  Instead, you need to take cyber defence seriously yourselfs, which firstly means making data unobtainable, either through encryption or through destruction.  \n\nEurope had a sane-ish first step under GDPR, but now they have started doing the opposite via [Chat Control](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1nb2hnr/perceptual_hashing/) and [data retention](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1pkq6qy/eu_revives_plan_for_yearlong_data_retention/).   European nations even hires foreign companies for wiretapping like Palantir and Huawei, meanwhile the FBI now endorses end-to-end encryption like Signal because they discovered they'd never remove Chinese spies from [their CALEA mandated wiretapping infrastructure](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/calea-was-a-national-security-disaster-waiting-to-happen)\n\nIn fact, Europe's idiot leaders signed the [UN cybercrime convention](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Unlimited-Evidence-Gathering-EU-Ratifies-Controversial-UN-Cybercrime-Convention-10752328.html) which effectively promises to criminalize developing \"cyber defence\" (hint: It's written by Russia).",

As otherwise it couldn’t function. But that kind of thing tends to require serious consideration for RMM script execution, as they write the scripts onto disk ad-hoc (hopefully they handle signed scripts correctly).\n\nBut don't exclude RMM tools from on-access or behavioural scanning of your EDR, that'd be silly. Supply chain compromises can and do happen, and allow listing directories that the RMM resides within is a really good way to be compromised. If you allow-list the individual hashes of the program, that would be extra work every time there's an agent update, and also means RMM script execution likely would not be possible to exclude by hash or signature alone.\n\nAnd then from the attacker perspective, if I want somewhere to execute further code without anyone stopping me, I would enumerate all installed programs and look up their documented paths the vendor recommends be excluded from EDR. If whoever admins those systems has added those exclusions, surely one of those directories is a perfect place for a persistent backdoor.",

It's fine to use it to find information for you, especially when it's a needle in a haystack, but always go the source and do some actual reading. Don't blindly trust summaries or cited sources and you should be ok. Hallucination is becoming less of a problem, but it's still a problem.\n\nI don't personally read many books or PDFs these days. I'm reading writeups, watching talks, or even skimming RFCs more than anything. I like to follow along when possible and set up labs to learn new tools or software.\n\nRSS feeds, following the right people on social media, word of mouth, and intel sharing are the best ways I know to stay on top of what's going on at the moment.",

Hiring someone else is not carte blanche to not give a fuck. Ubisoft has enough technical resources to be expected to vet a contractors processes and policies for handling data, more than enough technical know-how to be held liable in the case of a breach. It might be different for small businesses or solo, non-technical workers who don't have the capacity or knowledge to assess a vendor's security practices. But Ubisoft is not such an organization.\n\nIn this case it's probably not relevant unless actual consumer data or payment methods are shown to be compromised due to the outsourcing, but your statement is just wrong.",

          "text": "\"A new sample of the ToneShell backdoor, typically seen in Chinese cyberespionage campaigns, has been delivered through a kernel-mode loader in attacks against government organizations.\n\nThe backdoor has been attributed to the Mustang Panda group, also known as HoneyMyte or Bronze President, that usually targets government agencies, NGOs, think tanks, and other high-profile organizations worldwide.\n\nSecurity researchers at Kaspersky analyzed a malicious file driver found on computer systems in Asia and discovered that it has been used in campaigns since at least February 2025 against government organizations in Myanmar, Thailand, and other Asian countries.\n\nEvidence showed that the compromised entities had prior infections with older ToneShell variants, PlugX malware, or the ToneDisk USB worm, also attributed to state-sponsored Chinese hackers.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, the new ToneShell backdoor was deployed by a mini-filter driver named ProjectConfiguration.sys and signed with a stolen or leaked certificate valid between 2012 and 2015 and issued to Guangzhou Kingteller Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nMini-filters are kernel-mode drivers that plug into the Windows file-system I/O stack and can inspect, modify, or block file operations. Security software, encryption tools, and backup utilities typically use them.\n\nProjectConfiguration.sys embeds two user-mode shellcodes in its .data section, each executed as a separate user-mode thread to be injected into user-mode processes.\n\nTo evade static analysis, the driver resolves required kernel APIs at runtime by enumerating loaded kernel modules and matching function hashes, rather than importing functions directly.\n\nIt registers as a mini-filter driver and intercepts file-system operations related to deletion and renaming. When such operations target the driver itself, they are blocked by forcing the request to fail.\n\nThe driver also protects its service-related registry keys by registering a registry callback and denying attempts to create or open them. To ensure priority over security products, it selects a mini-filter altitude above the antivirus-reserved range.\n\nAdditionally, the rootkit interferes with Microsoft Defender by modifying the configuration of the WdFilter driver so it is not loaded into the I/O stack.\n\nTo shield injected user-mode payloads, the driver maintains a list of protected process IDs, denies handle access to those processes while the payloads are executing, and removes protection once execution completes.\n\n\"This is the first time we’ve seen ToneShell delivered through a kernel-mode loader, giving it protection from user-mode monitoring and benefiting from the rootkit capabilities of the driver that hides its activity from security tools,\" says Kaspersky.\n\nThe new variant of the ToneShell backdoor that Kaspersky analyzed features changes and stealth enhancements. The malware now uses a new host identification scheme based on a 4-byte host ID market instead of the 16-byte GUID used previously, and also applies network traffic obfuscation with fake TLS headers.\n\nIn terms of the supported remote operations, the backdoor now supports the following commands:\n\n0x1 — Create a temporary file for incoming data\n\n0x2 / 0x3 — Download file\n\n0x4 — Cancel download\n\n0x7 — Establish a remote shell via a pipe\n\n0x8 — Receive operator command\n\n0x9 — Terminate shell\n\n0xA / 0xB — Upload file\n\n0xC — Cancel upload\n\n0xD — Close connection\n\nKaspersky advises that memory forensics is key in uncovering ToneShell infections backed by the new kernel-mode injector.\n\nThe researchers have high confidence in attributing the new ToneShell backdoor sample to the Mustang Panda cyberespionage group. They assess that the threat actor has evolved its tactics, techniques, and procedures to gain operational stealth and resilience.\n\nThe cybersecurity company provides in its report a short list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) to help organizations detect Mustang Panda intrusions and defend against them.\"",

The commonality among governance, risk, and compliance is they are all strategic in nature, meaning they are mostly in the hands of the senior level of an organization (e.g., board or ownership). While there are components that are operational, that's mostly the box checking, the data collection. Translating that data into an actionable strategy, however, takes a lot of experience and general business acumen.  Whether addressing GRC in a third-party role (auditing or consulting) or internally, it can be very challenging because you end up sandwiched between a senior level that might not respect your strategic insight and operational employees who don't think you have the technical chops. This is why, in my experience, the people who are effective in the job tend to have pretty deep resumes.",

And now, I am going to grab an excerpt from an article I wrote in response to this:\n\nYou need to see what it really takes to get your compliance initiative off the ground, so that you can be sure that your team of engineers can actually pull off what you're going to put on them.\n\nWhat will you have to say when a customer asks you a tough question that requires actual hands-on knowledge? Ask the engineers you tasked with an assignment without actually knowing whether or not the job was done correctly? I couldn’t fathom being responsible for building or managing (and attesting to the deliverables from) a team of cybersecurity professionals if I didn’t have some form of hands-on experience in what I was managing. Most people work their way up to management from said trenches; whereas they have developed, through trials and tribulation, the skills necessary to guarantee a good job is done.\n\nHaving hands-on experience sifting through logs or applying procedure to policy hints at a much deeper degree of understanding and capability. This is what companies are really looking for today. Not a master of theory. Not a pencil pusher. A practitioner. A doer. They want someone they can trust.\n\nWhen you are getting a job in cyber, you are being trusted to handle the most sensitive aspects of a business. If all you have is some theory and limited experience with online lab exercises, but you’ve “never actually touched a router” or applied a ZTA framework to a network design (or even used a console cable) then how can you expect a business to take you seriously and entrust the physical routers and their actual IT infrastructure to you when you are supposed to “know this stuff” inside and out? Are they supposed to just trust that you can provide legitimate attestation of compliance that would stand up to scrutiny or hold up in a court of law? Audits must be verified, because there are times when automated scans will come back missing key information about infrastructure or services, or cannot be performed on sensitive architecture.\n\nYes, we have jobs that don’t require you to physically touch things, but these all require skills that in of themselves will expose you to what you would have seen in your own lab anyways. Being prepared; knowing what you are looking at; is worth gold. With hands-on experience, you won't just know what it really takes to get a stack up to snuff, you'll know how to prove it was done correctly. You won't be able to do that otherwise.\n\nEnd excerpt. With all that being said, GRC is not a beginner-friendly job because, as I mentioned in the trials and tribulations bit, you need to know what it really looks like to take a system, harden it, apply policy that aligns with an organizational goal, and provide legitimate attestation of compliance. It is more suited for people that value a desk job more than the thrill of the chase, and people tend to loathe auditors. Orin Thomas  of Microsoft famously refers to them during his seminars as \"The Guys With Ties,\" and frames them as  villains.",

Someone who’s very strong technically but has poor communication skills and never learned out to write can often be a very bad fit.  It’s also important they think systematically.  GRC you can’t just do one thing well.  You have to think across the organization how different processes tie together.  If you tend to be someone that can do that, may be a good fit.  If you’re someone that does better mastering repeatable processes GRCs not the place.  You have to really know yourself and what your strengths are.",

It also requires a fair handle on general tech subjects so you can speak about them eloquently and understand how it fits in your slice of GRC.  I would argue it isn't easy to be successful.  I will agree that hiring managers tend to put the wrong bodies in GRC spots often.  \n\nGRC also is not for people with tech backgrounds that NEED to get their hands dirty.  You will have almost zero opportunity to fix something that isn't a process or procedure.  You also will not want to seek that out as GRC because when you get busy, it's real tedious, and others will just expect you to help the stuff you added on because \"That GRC person never seems busy\".    \n\nHonestly, the two spots I've seen in most large orgs that are easy/coastable spots are:\n\nVulnerability Reporting - and I don't mean people who do actual vulnerability management but the ones who merely run the tool and do reports.  They often won't be trained very well on whatever tool they're using, they'll often claim that \"managing\" the vulnerability is on the owners of the system, not on their team as they just report them.   I've been at numerous big orgs at this point and it's the same story - vuln management just reports, doesn't fix.   And they'll almost never be able to do the report you want.  \n\nThird Party Risk Management - no offense to the TPRM folks in the crowd, but I've never met another team that acts like managing the relationship with a vendor through surveys is the most grueling thing they've ever done in their life.  My main friend in TPRM sends me messages almost every day about how he didn't wake up until noon and no one came looking for him.  The other people on his team show up and leave at all hours and no one cares.  It's absolutely fucking mind blowing to me.   The other big orgs I've been at had one, maybe two people doing this work - this one has a team and they're not that much bigger of an org.  You want a cake walk?  This is it.",

I start a new gig later this month, here's what I had to do. \n\nLinkedin full of all the right words, nobody is going to actually read it, but it has to scan well enough for both bot or person to see what they want. \n\nI searched every single technology recruitment firm (not corporate recruitment as part of their HR) and messaged each and every one of them with my resume. Some only communicate on linkedin via messaging, some have their own web page with a form you fill and some just have email. Write an introductory blurb you can recycle and use it for your email or forms. I could hit about 30 in about two hours if I were focused. I filtered based on US location (but you may do it differently) and more than 10k followers. You'll hit some duds and dead ends, but it is a numbers game. Remember 3rd party recruiters only get paid when they fill a spot. You don't have to be the best person for the role, you just have to be easy to sell and most importantly AVAILABLE immediately. They are incentivized to pump you up for the interview. This approach got me the most traction. I had quite a few interviews with this approach, I got my last job using this method. Sadly, I couldn't close any positions I interviewed for, probably close to a dozen calls. \n\nOf all the irony, I got my current role by doing the thing I've NEVER in my life done. I applied on the company website, interviewed and got the role. Seriously, this approach has gotten me the fewest number of interviews and has never, until now, resulted in a job. \n\nI did not waste my time redoing my resume for each and every job. If you're applying to similar roles, there should be no reason to do this. I bought a subscription to Teal, I didn't find it very useful. It was slow and clunky, there was no button that would just tune your resume. It would just show you what was wrong and tell you to fix it. Would not recommend. I bought another that literally robo-filled applications for you on a select number of websites. It worked REALLY well, so if you're going for straight numbers, you might want to do it. You populated your data, gave it search criteria and just let it run. It seriously just auto-fills EVERYTHING for you, never got hung up or stuck and just ran as long as you let it run. You have to buy credits to fuel it, but they were cheap. I think it was called LiftMyCV.",

Compliance and grc can greatly impact finances if something goes wrong, but it's often a backburnered position. \n\nThe battle you're facing is one of being unique in your field. This is going to require things like making your resume a bit more modern. Try looking at different resume templates on places like canva for ideas on that front. You'll also need individualized cover letters for each position you apply for. Since 90% of the resumes your sending out are filtered through ai before they even get to a person, cover letters add extra bs to the like that may satisfy the rubric they're grading applicants on. \n\nLastly, networking is going to be your friend. You're going to need to use LinkedIn or go to some in person conferences and \"expand your professional network\" to get your resume and skills in front of more people. My success rate on blind applications is far lower than jobs referred by someone in my network. \n\nGood luck!",

You already mentioned the clearance issue but I could also see these two things holding it back. I’m not the most experienced person out there but I have recruiters out of the blue hitting me up ever so often on LinkedIn for jobs and I assume it’s because of my resume. I list everything in bullets and keep any descriptions to one line as much as possible while keep text and character spacing as compact as possible so it’s all on one page.

The fork in the road has these paths.\n\n*  Obtain AWS Security Specialty.  Create projects for a security portfolio.  Learn to create scripts in Bash/Python/Powershell.  Apply for Cyber Engineer positions.\n* Obtain AWS Solutions Architect Professional.  Move into Solutions Architect work\n* Look at paths to go into Cybersales or presales or TAM work.\n* Another option would trying to get a Cloud Engineer or Cloud Ops job, maybe look at AWS CloudOps cert instead of Security Specialty.\n\n  \nWhich would be the easiest to path into?  I've worked Helpdesk (2008-2011)->LAN Admin (2011-2017)->Security Analyst (2017-2025 Laid off in March).  2021-2025 had me lightly touching AWS Cloud, but our Cloud Sec Ops handled most of that.

I was a Sr Analyst, but honestly I feel I was just a regular analyst.  I got promoted when we had an exodus of our Director, Principles, and Sr analysts during the great resignation.  I think it was more a retention promotion.  It was me and an older guy who didn't know shit, but had an old CISSP.  He was a documentation guy tbh and would come to me for everything.  This was at a SaaS company selling contract lifecycle mangement and shit like that.[](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-lowe-6644ab18/overlay/urn:li:fsd_profilePosition:(ACoAAAOh5-wBg9xkhBK1oXEpzm5GW8nNlfvv744,1913406065)/skill-associations-details?profileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAOh5-wBg9xkhBK1oXEpzm5GW8nNlfvv744)\n\n* Working knowledge of NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, and SOC (vendor reviews including SOC Type 2).

Most of the agent tools like Copilot and Claude offer sandboxing and allowing/disallowing certain tools, for example file modification and such, and enabling requiring-approvals, but that's all disabled by default and has to be configured by the user. \n\nThere exists a need to apply preventative controls to all users, and I'm not sure what the answer is.",

LLM is prone to hallucinations and Symbolic is logic based and needs constant rules updating. \n\nBoth so far are generalist and don't understand nuance or your operating environment. \n\nAn action done by customer service could be a compromised account but if it was done by engineering or done in a test environment would be completely legitimate. \n\nI like symbolic because I can understand what logic is being applied and can quickly rule in or rule out an alert. The black box nature of LLM leaves me questioning why an alert went off. Like why does it compute that this is malicious. \n\nI think that AI could have a possibility of helping if it is augmented with all the relevant information such as employee dept and title and if it was baselined with about 5 years of normal activity within your environment. \n\nSo far I have seen a lot of sloppy AI work. I believe that it still needs humans to check what it's doing. \n\nIf anything it's helped the offense more than the defense. Fixing the grammar and spelling for phishing emails but there's still things that I spot in phishing that AI hasn't fixed yet. Most common is using \"kindly\" and \"regards\" just aren't common in normal emails but are in 50% of the Phish that I see. Probably jinxing myself by mentioning it.",

Better writing, more persuasive emails, etc. Video and voice emulation is probably going to start changing the way we trust videoconferencing, but it'll mostly be at the whaling level since it requires real-time attention by the attacker.\n\nOn the employment side of things, expect to see companies trying to get by with fewer low-end analyst jobs. My advice there is essentially unchanged, however, which is that trying to get an \"entry level cybersecurity job\" is generally a bad idea. Get a helpdesk position, develop a thorough understanding of how computers and networking works when it's not under attack, then pivot into cybersecurity once you have a few years under your belt.\n\nFrom a product perspective, expect every company to claim AI is now powering their software. That will mean wildly differing things and should mostly be ignored. Consider whether the resultant product functions well or not, same as ever.\n\nIn terms of \"how will companies allow their employees to interact with LLMs?\", expect places to settle on single solutions that they pay to not incorporate queries into training data. So, you'll have Microsoft shops that require you to use Copilot, Google shops are 100% in on Gemini, etc.",

Basically every role that is repetitive and done through a browser/console can and perhaps should be automated, with the right level of human approval and involvement. But only once you can trust it..\n\nThis is not news. No one is writing machine code anymore, we write Python.

When we say AI powered it is implementing inline ML engines for detection, analysis and prevention in addition to packet filtering and DPI.  \n\nBut based on my ML experience, a large dependency is on the model chosen, and the prediction accuracy. Did not dive into the details, but it does not guarantee 100% accuracy.\n\n Also the two key factors of a firewall is efficacy and performance, so if there is an inline ML engine in the datapath, it should be high performance. \n\nBut yes, AI has hallucinations, and raises both false positives and negatives. This is new and exciting, but integrating in NGFW requires careful handling, which the majority of the vendors have taken care of I believe.\n\nAlso AI agents to implement FW configs is what most vendors have done, and is a cool feature.",

      "text": "I work on the internal security team at a regulated payments company. We process card transactions for other businesses, so outages immediately hit revenue and compliance nerves at the same time. The incident response bridge was opened when a supplier that handles part of our transaction routing began timing out during peak volume.\n\nAt the beginning it was framed as an availability issue, with transactions backing up and pressure building to provide a clear restoration timeline to the business. I joined because the integration touches regulated data, but the expectation was still that security would stay in the background unless something obviously malicious surfaced.\n\nAbout half an hour in, while people were debating rollback options, I started looking at the logs we were sharing. The retry traffic looked wrong. Requests were hitting endpoints that are not part of the documented production path. The supplier kept repeating that nothing had changed and that they were failing over internally to keep service alive.\n\nWhat they did not mention until later was that the failover path routes through an older service we thought was decommissioned. It still worked, which is why no alarms fired, but it bypasses one of our monitoring layers and handles data differently. We never designed it to run under load, let alone during an incident.\n\nAt that point I said out loud that this stopped being a clean outage. The response was immediate pushback. Procurement jumped in to say the supplier had already been reviewed and approved. Someone referenced the third-party record and said Panorays showed no active issues, like that settled the question. The score had not changed, so in their minds the risk had not either.\n\nI am watching live traffic move through a path we do not actively control while the incident is still in progress and recovery speed has become the dominant concern. Everyone else wants to keep the scope narrow so the bridge can be closed and the issue treated as resolved. I am stuck trying to explain why a system behaving exactly as it was never meant to behave cannot just be dismissed as operational noise.\n\nHow do I push to reclassify this without being remembered as the person who delayed recovery and forced old approval decisions back into active dispute?",

I don’t know your circumstances but if it’s still a current vendor, although it’s definitely a big red flag it’s not on the same level as a full service outage. It’s all risk like you say, but it was a previously approved system with a current contracted vendor so it’s probably not _that_ bad",

          "text": "\"an older service we thought was decommissioned. It still worked\"...that right there would be considered a security incident, that's a huge change control failure.  You mentioned \"regulated data\", so if this data is now passing through a service that cannot legally support those regulatory requirements...really, this is out of your hands.  This is how I would frame it; this would be considered a data leak, or in more strict NIST 800-53 language an active \"information leakage\" event. Right now you should be preparing to contact whatever regulatory authorities are over this data, at a minimum you should file a report via CISA so you have a solid third-party evidence artifact.  At my workplace, I would be calling DC3 as it would be some CUI data flow going through a service that was never assessed or given ATO to handle that data.\n\nThe bad part: you will be remembered as the guy who delayed recovery, maybe.  Honestly, that is just part of the job of cyber security. We always make everything more complicated. My email signature is literally \"security is directly proportional to inconvenience\".  I am always that guy saying \"wait, not so fast, what about XYZ regulation?\" or \"that cloud vendor isn't FedRAMP so we can't send them that type of data\"...I've even argued with senior VIPS and pulled the whole \"if the company does X, that will border on potential wilful negligence that has actual criminal potential under DFARS\" and have had to stick to my guns. That VIP no longer works for my company, not because of that (probably? I didn't report them or anything but...) but this is the hard part of the job.  Or the fun part, depending on your personality LOL.\n\nBut you don't HAVE to delay anything; just keep record of the data leak; contact the appropriate regulatory authorities NOW, but let everyone else get it resolved. Let them know there WILL be an after-action report follow-up on this, and that the failures WILL be addressed and systems WILL be decommissioned. Use the power that comes from the regulations to push the needed fix; that's why they exist.  Remember, ALL REGULATIONS ARE WRITTEN IN BLOOD.  Something bad happened in the past, this regulation is part of the fix. Preserve your evidence. \n\nI would also say that something is amiss with the Panorays stuff.  I'm not familiar with it, but a system that was SUPPOSED to be decommissioned but wasn't and is now flowing regulated data should 100% be increasing whatever risk assessment system it uses.  If it's not, that means that probably it has ZERO visibility of the actual data flow path endpoints.",

These agents screenshot challenges, send to GPT-4V/Claude, and get exact click coordinates back. reCAPTCHA and Turnstile weren't built for this.\n\nThis statement suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of reCAPTCHA and Turnstile.\n\nBoth reCAPTCHA and Turnstile can be configured to operate invisibly, both have made the decision whether or not to issue a token before the user ever interacts with it, and in case the site operator decides to make them display a widget or an interactive challenge, it is mostly for cosmetic/UX reasons and doesn’t meaningfully change the results. \n\nModern CAPTCHAs primarily use signals from your browser, your IP reputation history, your browsing activity (including on other websites) as seen by their network, and for Google, whether you’re logged into a Google account and the internal reputation score of that account. \n\nThat is also why any self-hosted CAPTCHA will never be as good, because you simply don’t have access to the same kind of signals across millions of different websites that Cloudflare and Google do.\n\nIf you don’t believe me, just try it for yourself on a known tainted IP address/blocked browser signals: simply Tor browser and try to pass a reCAPTCHA. Good luck.\n\nOr alternatively, look at it from an economic POV: the prices of bulk reCAPTCHA or Turnstile solves hasn’t meaningfully gone down with the introduction of vision AI or LLMs.",

In the workplace, your knowledge of X might get you into conversations where you know nothing about Y and Z. For example, you might be hired for your competence at secure application development, but then you'll find yourself pulled into a conversation about managing privileged access in Windows environments.\n\n\nYou kind of have to roll with it. I find that assuming good intentions from co-workers and leaders helps. \n\n\nIn a wider context, security is risk-based decision making, so try to approach security problems by identifying risks, vulnerabilities, threats, potential impacts, and then controls to help mitigate or avoid those risks. Breaking problems down by this will help you rely less on a product-oriented or reactive approach to risks where you first look for product features to turn on to solve the problem.\n\n\nAnd personally, focusing on security fundamentals has helped me develop general confidence. Widely-accepted certs like Sec+ and CySA+ have helped me learn and study these. (Pick the certs yourself, though; I don't love what I've heard about CompTIA lately.)",

Understanding what your TL and manager need you to complete for projects to be successful. If that requires more expertise in a specific security domain, then learn more there. Since you have a SWE background I’m guessing your role will be focused on building things, where you’ll be more successful in learning how to be an engineer in that company’s ecosystem. Not necessarily in learning more about “security” in general or worrying about certs. \n\nYou can have a conversation with your manager and ask things like “how do I make sure I’m successful here?
