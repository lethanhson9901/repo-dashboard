All AI really brings to the table is speed and confidence, so apply that to recovery as well. It's less of an issue if the AI breaks something, as long as it can detect that it has done so and restore things to how they were before a human has had time to react.

Kiro had operator-level permissions, no mandatory peer review, and no enforcement boundary between \"I am authorized to be here\" and \"I am authorized to do this.\" Those are two completely different things and almost nobody is treating them differently yet.​\n\nAmazon called it user error. Technically they are right. But \"user error\" in an agentic world is a policy failure, not a human failure. The human made a mistake with permissions once. The agent executed that mistake at machine speed, without hesitation, without a second thought, across a production environment. Thirteen hours.\n\nI built [MarkdownLM](https://markdownlm.com/) specifically for this gap. Not at the permissions layer, IAM and least-privilege are your infrastructure team's job. But at the policy layer, the layer that says \"even if you are authorized to touch this, here are the rules for how you touch it, and here is the gate that validates your output before it executes.\" That layer does not exist in most teams' workflows right now. The Kiro incident is what happens when it does not.",

Read-only actions go through. Anything that changes state has to present evidence first (dry-run/diff) and stay within a bounded scope. Truly destructive operations are blocked by default unless there’s explicit, time-limited approval.

I appreciate the fast follow up.\n\nThe one (lengthy) thing I’ll say about the conflict of interest issue is that while there may not be a conflict (and there doesn’t appear to be one in this case), the audience cannot and should not assume that there isn’t one, especially given the nature of Barrack AI’s business.\n\nIf a pharmaceutical company put out a white paper warning of the ills of a drug offered by competitors and every statement was factual, you’d be at least a bit skeptical even if the white paper didn’t mention the company’s competing product and it was co-written with an independent researcher. Why? Because the company funding the white paper stands to benefit in some way such as a better reputation or monetarily.\n\nAt best, we hope that you are an honest broker leveraging your expertise to help laypeople understand the import of the issues you’re raising. There is a place for customer education and it often does come from vendors, but readers like the ones that frequent this subreddit have to maintain that skepticism to be good stewards of the policies, tools, and practices at their own organization.\n\nWhile, I don’t believe Barrack AI is attempting to scam readers or falsely accuse any one of wrongdoing, we must remain vigilant that other less scrupulous actors will.",

The law states:\n\n>1798.501.\n\n> (a) An operating system provider shall do all of the following:\n\n>(1) Provide an accessible interface at account setup that requires an account holder to indicate the birth date, age, or both, of the user of that device for the purpose of providing a signal regarding the user’s age bracket to applications available in a covered application store.\n\n[https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill\\_id=202520260AB1043](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB1043)\n\nThere‘s no requirement I can find to make any check against the information provided by the account holder. Like many of us do with services such as Steam, nothing stops a person from supplying 1950-01-01 or similar as their birthday.\n\nThere’s also an odd interplay between “providing” an interface, implying the interface is optional, and that it “requires” something, implying the interface needs input IF the interface is used but the interface can be dismissed by the account holder when creating an account.\n\nMore also, many consumer devices today do not have local accounts created by the operating system - instead users authenticate against already existing cloud accounts from Microsoft, Google, Apple, etc. No “account setup” happens within the OS.\n\nAlso furthermore the bill has language discussing things like “covered application store” - the definition of which uses the phrase “covered application store” for a fun infinite loop - and while it limits the requirements of app to old those that come from a covered application store there is no such limit for OSes based on whether they utilized a covered application store.\n\nAgain also, what the heck is an “affected child” in the penalties section? Presumably a child who accesses something age-inappropriate from an app/device without an age bracket signal API? Or, any child at all who simply uses such an app/device?\n\nAnyway I’m tired of reading through it as it’s so vague. Possibly nothing will ever be done with this law. Possibly it will be used and it would be up to the courts to determine applicability, either broadly or in specifics.",

But as a parent I can setup a phone or computer for my child and let the OS know that this child was born Jan 1st 2020.\n\nThis is significantly better than what a lot of other states are trying to implement in terms of violating our privacy.

Beyond technology, we've seen time and time again that our politicians are out of touch with multiple issues, but technology has to be the worst and most offending topic. Everyone talks about age limits/term limits for elected offices (primarily Congress), but no one actually moves for it. Yet, we see dumb policies being made non-stop. We're seeing our right to digital privacy being stripped away: compute being gouged to push cloud, ID to use VPNs in the UK, and now this. \n\nTo put it bluntly, technologically literate people are the last bastion against this, and we're quite literally fighting our own industry peers on this. We know what needs what and what doesn't need to happen regarding tech to maintain what anonymity we currently have, and it's vice versa to those that are consulting & drafting these abysmal policies.\n\nThe DOJ/Supreme Court needs to set a precedent for states to not surveil what OS I use, but at this rate, they'd probably rule in favor of the digital ID Trojan just to make it happen faster.",

Not sure if there’s a word but it doesn’t seem to have any language that requires the age inputted at setup be verified, just that it has to ask for your age when you setup the computer. And at face value I do think there could be a valid argument in favour of requiring an OS-level age setting for an entire device because that makes it much easier for a parent to enforce parental controls. Definitely should be exceptions though, or make it mandatory that it has to exist but could be turned off - then it’s up to the purchaser if they activate the OS-level age protection.  \n\nObviously with all the context of what’s going on worldwide with age verification I think this needs to be watched suuuuper closely for privacy infringement but it doesn’t seem like this is the same as like what Discord tried. And there’s certainly a way this could be just a first step towards it being mandatory. But I also see no way to realistically enforce this, so I’d say this is only somewhat concerning and not a major issue.",

I'm happy to have dumped that stock long ago.",

I was surprised to see a password field displayed at all.  That doesn't seem very security minded.\n\nActual username is in the username field in plain text.  Not great, but ok.\n\nPassword field contains asterisks.  Curious to know if they defaulted it to asterisks or if they actually had it stored here in plain text, I inspected the field and switch the type from 'password' to 'text' and yep, the actual device password is right here in plain text.",

It's not always actually a security concern, but at least then we can explain why it isn't.  I can't speak for TP-Link, but they _should_ appreciate it as well. It's better to have people bring it to you than spread it around. \n\nAnd as a TP-Link customer, I would love for them to get it right. They should never store a password, ever. Only hashes of passwords. \n\nOn this page there is a paragraph with the heading \"Engagement with the security community\" which has an email address you can raise your concerns to. They may say you had credentials so it's not a security issue (it is though), or they may release a fix for it.\n\nhttps://www.tp-link.com/us/landing/security-commitment/",

I work for the government and protect sensitive information for a living (not with TP-Link hardware thankfully).  Many of us who operate regulated environments appreciate the early disclosures we often get from each other in IRC, Discord, various subreddits, etc... and I've often been made aware of and acted on issues *long* before vendors acknowledged/fixed those issues in the past.\n\nI know it's a potential black eye for the vendor, but for my admin team and cybersecurity, we've been glad to have been made aware in advance so we can take action early.

Cisco for example has an additional config line to enable storing passwords in an encrypted fashion, but that would imply it can also be decrypted again rather than it being a hashed password that you can't get back, and also that it is not even the default.\n\nOn most network gear in businesses you should just be disabling the password logon and managing the devices with ssh keys or a radius server with some kind of federated auth.",

It is starting to change in recent years to some more common good practice things (new versions of Cisco switches will have MD5 hashing enabled for the password, old versions defaulted to plain text with the option to enable it).\n\nI am struggling to find information about why this is but I suspect its a \"if the attacker can get this config you are already screwed\" so they dont stand to gain much from a single network device password. Enterprise firewalls are all a bit better than switches for security as they were always perimeter devices and therefore part of the keep keeping attackers out of the network to begin with.\n\nRegardless with or without a password, physical access makes it incredibly easy for anyone to walk in, wipe and reconfigure network equipment to their own gain as all of these devices have some way to wipe them without a password, or in some older cases just remove the password from the config entirely to gain unauthed access.",

          "text": "So I was in your shoes about 10 years ago (definitely some differences in our background, but still some similarities). I can share some perspective from my journey, but at the same time things are different now than they were when I came up. So while I can offer you my take, I unfortunately do not have a recipe you can simply follow today...and I suspect nobody else does, either (regardless of what they might claim).\n\nSo there is no reliably \"easy\" way to enter cyber security, no matter what you do. There isn't any sort of \"official\" entry point, so you kind of have to run around and find your own unique way (and probably suffer through a bit of bullshit for a while). \n\nThere are of course some people who seem to just breeze in, but that is very much the exception in my experience, and even then there are usually parts of their story that they just don't advertise, because there is a pretty sizeable percentage of cyber sec that are basically just liars. There is a lot of trust and secrecy and privileged access in cyber sec, and unfortunately that allows and even incentives a lot of dishonesty. It generally doesn't reliably pay off long term...but you will definitely see some liars and assholes get ahead of you before you find your groove. So be prepared for that, and don't let it get in your head.\n\nFor me, the first two years of cybersec were absolute hell (and two after that were better but still rough). I applied to a bunch of places and got nowhere. The only place that would take me was a really gross, scammy MSSP that lied to the people working there as much as to their clients. They told us they would give us all kinds of training, but in reality all they wanted was for us to get a bunch of sales certs so they could advertise that to their customers and lie about our qualifications.\n\nIt sucked on a daily basis -- long hours, stupid and pointless work, and constant lies / pressure to play along. But it did give me two crucial things:\n\n1) Experience on my resume\n\n2) Connections with other people in the industry\n\nI sweated it out for about 6 months at that place, constantly looking for another position and continuing to do things to network (attending security meetups in your location is a good way to go -- it gives you a place to practice and show off the stuff you've learned to people other than yourself, and gets your name out there, and I *definitely* benefitted from some of the presentations I gave that were also recorded so I could link them on my resume).\n\nEventually, some of the people in my cohort managed to get jobs elsewhere, and because I had forged close connections with them and they liked me they let me know about additional openings and recommended me for them, and between my qualifications on resume and the fact that I had people inside recommending me, I finally managed to get a new and better job.\n\nBut only *sightly* better. I had to repeat this process a few times at a few companies for a couple of years before I finally worked my way up to a position that was actually decent.\n\nIt didn't take that long in the grand scheme of things, but it *felt* like it took forever when I was in the middle of it. And it sucked having to spend years doing things that felt stupid and wrong for very little money. I felt left out, inadequate, and like I was doing something wrong (especially because I saw people I knew for a fact sucked ass get ahead)...but after about 3 years everything suddenly got *way* easier.\n\nIt was like being in a plane where you are taking off and going through a bunch of clouds and hitting a bunch of turbulence, and then suddenly breaking through the clouds into the sun, where everything is bright and glowing and suddenly smooth.\n\nThat happened because of a combination of reasons. For one, I developed a critical mass of contacts and reputation so that enough people knew about and were talking about me that I happened to come up in a conversation about a job worth having. \n\nFor two, having a few years of documented experience gets you through a *lot* of hard limits -- a lot of positions will just throw you out without looking if you have less than 2 years experience. \n\nAnd for three, I gained experience not just in my craft but also in navigating corporate organizations. It allowed me to have conversations with the right people and leave them with the right impression. It allowed me to better understand how to pjt myself in the right place at the right time. It allowed me to understand how to get appropriate credit for my work (rather than doing good work but being overlooked for it). And so on. It's kind of like learning how to date in a weird way.\n\nSo if I were to offer you advice, I would tell you to lower your initial expectations. Look at shittier jobs than you otherwise would. A lot of the stuff you're doing now won't pay off until later, and you should expect the first bit to suck. Maybe you'll get lucky and it won't suck...but you shouldn't be surprised if it sucks. And don't beat yourself up if you have to settle for a gross job at first -- it won't last forever, and you can always omit it when you have better experience to put forth (I still have that first gross company on my resume but I don't say anything about it unless asked, and instead focus on my more recent positions).\n\nBasically, you need to get some experience on your resume, and the sooner you do that, the better. And if you can't get the jobs you are shooting for now, start going for worse ones. Again, it's like dating -- just like you shouldn't expect to marry the first person you have sex with/shouldn't exclusively date people you know you want to marry in advance, you also shouldn't expect to spend your entire career at the first company you get hired at. So if you are having trouble, get less picky -- you don't have to stop looking, and you can always leave as soon as you find something better.",

Look at clearance jobs or use key words on job searches.\n2. Be willing to apply, pick up and move anywhere unless you have a REALLY good reason not to. \n3. Don’t just spam applications, make meaningful changes to your resume each time to fit the job description. \n4. Look at IT and cyber jobs in defense and government contracting, they’ll be most likely to appreciate military experience nowadays. It’s always easier to find the job you want when you’re already employed.\n5. Watch some videos on tips with interviewing and practice what you want to say, it makes a big difference when you get to that stage. It’s a weird point to make, but there are positive things that applicants will say in interviews but they sometimes give the impression they want to move up quickly and leave. The clearance process and getting people trained is very time consuming and if they are just looking to pivot quickly, that’s a red flag for us hiring managers. Be enthusiastic and focus on details of the job you’re interviewing for, not what you want to become.\n6. Projects are nice but don’t burn yourself out on them.",

However, you must understand that you have a solid background to get an entry level job like everyone has said. Just due your due diligence and keep applying and tune your resume. Do you have projects under your belt? If not, get on that now. Certs are good, but having so many foundational ones don’t mean anything. Sec+, CySA+ and CCSP are the ones that matter in the list of certs you have. Pentest+ is ok primarily for theory but not so much practical imho. You have the degree, you have decent certs but lack hands on experience through projects.\n\nTryhackme writeups is great for building some hands on skills but it’s not a project. Try to think of ways to solve real business problems. Build a home lab environment and solve a few of those business problems from a security perspective. \n\nExample: Many orgs don’t have security baked into their software development practices. How would you solve that? Perhaps build a devsecops pipeline and integrate important security tools and automate security checks! Say you are done with a project, write up a report about it that you could present to stakeholders with the goal of explaining why they need that solution. Add quantitative data and slap that onto your resume. Companies that are hiring love hard numbers.\n\nThat is an example. But adding that to your resume to show you understand real life issues orgs face and showing that you understand how to solve those issues is extremely important.\n\nProjects aside, keep applying. \n1. Do 10 apps per day.\n2. Modify your resume to specifically address needs for 2 companies that you like each day. So apart from cold applying you’d be building a “company X” specific resume. \n3. Reach out to recruiters and peofessionals at a few of those companies as well and be proactive. Cold applying will not get you far, but you still need to do it. \n4. 5 bullet points of accomplishments per entry on your resume and add numbers. No more than 5.\nTry to keep resume 1 page.\n\nBy mixing in proactive reach outs and tailoring your resume for 2 specific companies per day will go a long way. The inclusion of bigger hands on projects will completely check off all 3 areas for you: higher education, certs and hands on experience.\n\nHope this helps!",

Go over to one of the sysadmin subs and you'll see dozens of posts complaining about security professionals that don't actually have a clue about the reality of their work which they are trying to police. \n\nI couldn't even get interviews in security out of uni, I gave up, went and did service desk for a few years, theb switched to networking for a slightly bigger firm who had a security team... Guess what... I then ended up getting my first security job at that company. \n\nThe experience I have of these other roles 100% makes me a better security analyst today. You have a much more intrinsic understanding of what is \"normal\" for your technical teams, and what is worth shouting about.\n\nWorst case scenario, you do some help desk for a few years and progress that career wherever it goes until the security role turns up...

There is competition for the “prize” openings. \n\nTook me about a year of off and on job searching to land a dedicated cybersecurity role with _less_ qualifications than you’ve got, but I settled for a SOC analyst role that was slightly better pay (but no on-call) than my previous job.

Just take a gander at USAJOBS, plus with cyber there is direct hire. I'm torn in that it used to be that a contractor went GS for stability and you'd factor that into where you want to work. I don't know if I believe that to be the case now. However, the firing (whomever says layoff is flat wrong) of all the civilian .gov and .mil folks has opened up a lot of positions if you want to do government service. A rewarding position both $$$ and you are continuing to serve your country. So if you wanted to leverage your prior time in service (thank you for your service by the way) using what you saw real-world (as well as the actual time when it comes to myriad of non-technical topics like retirement), your clearance, industry certifications ticking a lot of boxes on the 8570 chart (yes it's 8140, etc now but 8570 is good for discussing the requirements) AND a degree from a university that has a hell of a lot of credibility in the DoD and .gov realm - you are highly employable. \nJust on the contractor side the carnage from last year has generated a lot of contractor gigs while everything gets sorted. Someone has to do the work. But again, that same carnage has generated a big need for full time GS jobs - there are a LOT of  them.",

Almost every sys admin and network admins with years of experience are looking to or jumped into it.  All security engineer, architect, and manager now were former infrastructure admin/engineers.  Frankly, those people are attractive to hiring managers because infrastructure knowledge is essential in cyber.  Schools and certs can’t teach you enough in depth on fundamentals of email, DNS, active directory, networking and high availability designs without experience. I blame most cert orgs and school programs that mislead people with quick six figure salary and hyped up demand (for what they’ll produce). That leaves the entry level SOC or security admin jobs which are rapidly either going to cheaper oversea SOCs or AI/automation.  The problem is compounded by most small to midsize companies let their IT people do security — which leaves big companies who will only hire former IT people with security experience, even for entry level (because they can) or a PhD (Microsoft MVP equivalence) from eastern Europe or Latin America for almost the same price as mid tier people.  It’s not because hiring managers want to but that’s just the budget they give us to find that level of talent.  \n\nI’m not trying to drag you down further but just explaining why.  This is not the universe senselessly punishing YOU.  \n\nDon’t give up.  I’m sure you’ll find something.  I echo with people suggesting leveraging your clearance to stand out.   Also, take any IT job you can.  As a hiring manager, I would treat CompTIA certs as (meh) plus to any experience in IT.  You sound like you have enough certs.  Pivot to playing around with Sendmail, BIND, OpenVPN, firewalls, etc.  Also, learn automation through agentic AI.  It’ll happen my guy.  Just hang in there.",

You can lateral to deployment or network experience as well.  You can track your certs to your experience in some ways, now it's a matter of getting some mileage behind you (For what it's worth, your Uni should be able to help with this if there are career counsellors on staff,  or if alumni services can help).\n\nBut, you need direction.  Figure out where you want to actually go, and be prepared for that to change.  Most people (last I saw, I think it was over 60%) in Cybersecurity come at it from different other career tracks and that's actually good because you gain other perspectives.   If your work has other opportunities to gain experience, I'd stretch for that. \n\n",

Help desk, sys admin, noc technician, those areas. We get some years under our belt and maybe the org we're at has a path to security or maybe we give them a good 3 years and move along to a MSSP.

Same code, same data, now on a sheet of paper. When asked why, the explanation is \"Chinese hackers.\" A consultancy warned them. So the defensive move is to downgrade a digital system into a 1998 office workflow and pretend this is cybersecurity.\n\nGo to China and you cannot move without a QR code. Transport, payments, buildings, government services. No paper, no drama, no pretending scanners can tell the difference between a phone screen and a printer. It works because the system is designed for reality, not fear. Imagine trying to implement that here. They’d commission a consultancy. The consultancy would recommend buying 50,000 printers. Every airport, every port of entry, every office stacked with paper so officials can \"securely\" scan digital codes off dead trees. This is how Britain is broken.",

Company rolls out invasive data collection, frames it as safety, gets backlash, \"pauses\" to let the news cycle move on, then quietly resumes with minor tweaks.\n\nThe core issue isn't age verification itself — it's that companies keep trying to solve policy problems with surveillance infrastructure. Every age verification system that actually works requires collecting sensitive biometric or identity data, which creates exactly the kind of high-value target that cybersecurity teams spend their careers trying to minimize.\n\nFrom a governance perspective, Discord's mistake was deploying before answering the basic questions: Where does the verification data sit? Who has access? What's the retention policy? What happens when (not if) it gets breached? The fact that they're \"pausing\" suggests they didn't have good answers.\n\nThe broader problem is there's no industry standard for privacy-preserving age verification. Everyone's rolling their own implementation, which means everyone's making their own mistakes. This is exactly the kind of problem that needs a regulatory framework rather than letting each platform experiment on their users.\n",

          "text": "\"A team of researchers from the University of California, Riverside revealed a series of weaknesses in existing Wi-Fi security, allowing them to intercept data on a network infrastructure that they’ve already connected to, even with client isolation in place.\n\nThe group called this vulnerability, AirSnitch, and, according to their paper [PDF], it exploits inherent weaknesses in the networking stack. Since Wi-Fi does not cryptographically link client MAC addresses, Wi-Fi encryption keys, and IP addresses through Layers 1, 2, and 3 of the network stack, an attacker can use this to assume the identity of another device and confuse the network into diverting downlink and uplink traffic through it.\n\nXin’an Zhou, the lead author on the research, said in an interview, according to Ars Technica, that AirSnitch “breaks worldwide Wi-Fi encryption, and it might have the potential to enable advanced cyberattacks.” He also added, “Advanced attacks can build on our primitives to [perform] cookie stealing, DNS and cache poisoning. Our research physically wiretaps the wire altogether so these sophisticated attacks will work. It’s really a threat to worldwide network security.”\n\nAirSnitch does not break encryption at all, but it challenges the general assumption that encrypted clients cannot attack each other because they’ve been cryptographically isolated.\n\nThere are four primary ways that AirSnitch uses to bypass client isolation. The first is by abusing shared keys — since most networks use a single password or a Group Temporal Key (GTK), an attacker can make packets aimed for a specific target and wrap it inside a GTK broadcast frame to make it look like legitimate information meant for everyone. The target would then accept the traffic, thinking that it’s a broadcast packet, allowing the attacker to use that as an initial opening for more complex attacks.\n\nAnother attack vector is Gateway Bouncing, where the attacker sends data to an access point that’s addressed to a gateway MAC. When the gateway receives it, it sees that Layer 3 IP header, which is the victim’s IP address, but ignores the Layer 2 destination (which is the gateway itself). It then forwards that to the victim, essentially allowing one client to send data to another client without doing so directly. The other two vulnerabilities include MAC spoofing — the attacker can spoof the MAC of the victim, meaning the gateway will forward all downlink traffic to the attacker, or they could spoof the MAC of backend devices, like the gateway, receiving uplink traffic from the target.\n\nThe researchers found that these vulnerabilities exist in five popular home routers — Netgear Nighthawk x6 R8000, Tenda RX2 Pro, D-LINK DIR-3040, TP-Link Archer AXE75, and Asus RT-AX57 — two open-source firmwares — DD-WRT v3.0-r44715 and OpenWrt 24.10 — and across two university enterprise networks. This shows that the issue is not just limited to how manufacturers make and program their routers. Instead, it’s a problem with Wi-Fi itself, where its architecture is vulnerable to attackers who know how to take advantage of its flaws.\n\nWhile this may sound bad, the researchers pointed out that this type of attack is rather complicated, especially with how complicated modern wireless networks have become. Still, that does not mean that manufacturers and standardization groups should ignore this problem. The group hoped that this revelation would force the industry to come together and create a rigorous set of requirements for client isolation and avoid this flaw in the future.\"",

Being on the highly technical side - I figured that would put me in a good position in GRC, but with the advent of this AI stuff and seeing what agentic AI can do and crunch through your infra config and codebases with MCP Servers feeding all the relevant data into nicely formatted documents - I just don't know what future GRC has. Sure AI doesn't fully understand risk, sure AI doesn't fully understand context... But if it can augment a team of two GRC people to do the work of 10 GRC people, previously... Then even in that case, there will be so fewer jobs out there.\n\n\nBut it's only a short matter of time (IMO) before it can do the job as well as I can. \n\n\nSo I have no idea where that's going to leave me. AI has put a wrench in an otherwise well thought out, smooth transition plan, and I don't feel comfortable telling anyone where I'll be in 3 years nevermind 5 years from now. Mostly because I feel a lot of jobs are simply going to go away. I use opus 4.6, I create my agents and other configurations and it's augmenting and accelerating my work like never before.\n\n\nBut business is business. And when money can be saved...

And background check systems, as you've pointed out, just aren't equipped for that level of deception, especially when it involves state resources.\n\n  \nWhat really gets me is how this changes the game for internal security controls. We're talking about not just perimeter defenses or endpoint protection but also in-depth monitoring of code changes and anomalous behavior in repositories. It's a real race to stay ahead, and honestly, it's a bit terrifying how human factors have become such a big part of cyber threats now.",

Who will quite probably still have minimal idea of what they’re doing, but could leverage a sufficiently unrestricted AI to generate malicious code. They’re still unlikely to pose an enormous threat, but they could definitely do more damage. \n\nThe real problem is capable hackers who get access to AIs which are capable & unrestricted. Although AV software is getting much more capable with dynamic analysis, the fundamental structure of AVs is built off years worth of IoC data. A capable AI could pretty much replicate malicious code with slight tweaks, to avoid the static detections/weak dynamic detections. Or worse, a capable AI will no doubt eventually be able to create new variants of malicious code, or automate attacks in ways defenders aren’t prepared for.",
