      "text": "[https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/cisa-madhu-gottumukkala-chatgpt-00749361](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/cisa-madhu-gottumukkala-chatgpt-00749361)\n\n>  \nThe interim head of the country’s cyber defense agency uploaded sensitive contracting documents into a public version of ChatGPT last summer, triggering multiple automated security warnings that are meant to stop the theft or unintentional disclosure of government material from federal networks, according to four Department of Homeland Security officials with knowledge of the incident.\n\n>The apparent misstep from Madhu Gottumukkala was especially noteworthy because the acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had requested special permission from CISA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer to use the popular AI tool soon after arriving at the agency this May, three of the officials said. The app was blocked for other DHS employees at the time.\n\n>None of the files Gottumukkala plugged into ChatGPT were classified, according to the four officials, each of whom was granted anonymity for fear of retribution. But the material included CISA contracting documents marked “for official use only,” a government designation for information that is considered sensitive and not for public release.\n\n>Cybersecurity sensors at CISA flagged the uploads this past August, said the four officials. One official specified there were multiple such warnings in the first week of August alone. Senior officials at DHS subsequently led an internal review to assess if there had been any harm to government security from the exposures, according to two of the four officials.\n\n>It is not clear what the review concluded.\n\n>In an emailed statement, CISA’s Director of Public Affairs Marci McCarthy said Gottumukkala “was granted permission to use ChatGPT with DHS controls in place,” and that “this use was short-term and limited.” McCarthy added that the agency was committed to “harnessing AI and other cutting-edge technologies to drive government modernization and deliver on” Trump’s executive order [removing barriers to America’s leadership in AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/).\n\n>The email also appeared to dispute the timeline of POLITICO’s reporting: “Acting Director Dr. Madhu Gottumukkala last used ChatGPT in mid-July 2025 under an authorized temporary exception granted to some employees. CISA’s security posture remains to block access to ChatGPT by default unless granted an exception.”\n\n>",

People come up with amazing things using AI and it gets swiped. STOLEN.\n\nAsk Suchir Balaji. Oh wait, that’s right, Suchir Balaji is dead.\n\nSomeone should connect these dots before the elite destroy this planet…\n\nElla Cook. Nuno Loureiro, Feng Yanghe, TANG XIAOOU, HE ZHI, ZHANG DAIBING, QUAN YUHUI.\n\nAll dead. All working on high value, high target things. Once their work was completed… DEAD.\n\nIt’s all right there. Nobody cares. People make silly AI pictures and complain about small things like AI stole their pictures, and novels, and videos... It’s sickening.\n\nAI companies steal BIG things.\n\nSuchir Balaji knew that. He was a whistleblower. Now he’s dead. Everyone on this list is dead. How did that happen?

It's the outcome of how key custody is designed.\n\nThe real question is not whether BitLocker is broken.\n\nIt is who controls recovery key access, under what authority, and with what oversight. \n\nIf an organization centralizes recovery keys, then identity security (the permission to access these keys) becomes part of the encryption boundary. Privileged access controls, role separation, approval workflows, and auditing determine whether those keys are protected or casually exposed.",

Long story, but the point is that they got rid of the people in charge of modernizing a lot of gov and DOD infrastructure. Systems that would have made it much harder to hide black budgets.",

We show an adversary can extract gigabytes of training data from open-source language models like Pythia or GPT-Neo, semi-open models like LLaMA or Falcon, and closed models like ChatGPT. Existing techniques from the literature suffice to attack unaligned models; in order to attack the aligned ChatGPT, we develop a new divergence attack that causes the model to diverge from its chatbot-style generations and emit training data at a rate 150x higher than when behaving properly. Our methods show practical attacks can recover far more data than previously thought, and reveal that current alignment techniques do not eliminate memorization.",

There is a reason mailing lists like Full Disclosure existed and people used aliases to dump bugs they found. Eventually, the getting sued mostly stopped but basically your only reward for a long time was receiving credit on the patch announcement, which got street cred. The bug bounty thing came about after a lot of discussion about how to encourage researchers to report bugs responsibly and reward their efforts.\n\nBug bounty programs still pay very poorly relative to their real world value. You'll never see this change. The reality being that (software esp) security as a whole is viewed as a necessary burden, but budgets and timelines never reflect the real risks involved because it's all preventative. This applies to penetration testing / assessment efforts and bounty payouts. Most companies don't invest what they should to really make their products secure.\n\nThis is all compounded by the amount of work these programs require. People report junk bugs that aren't exploitable then start making demands. It's gotten worse with AI, because now they just run AI and report the bug without ever validating it is actually a bug. I saw several in the Linux kernel reported not long ago and ever single one was AI generated, none were real bugs. This creates a lot of work, but it also predates AI when people would run fuzzers and just report stuff without ever testing it. If people stopped reporting low effort crap then maybe these programs could improve as the cost to maintain them went down.",

One that they pay handsomely. And you noticed a small hole on the fence that someone could easily fit in that their dedicated fence team missed, despite getting paid for their work.\n\nHere's how the analogy would be seen from the \"dedicated fence team\".\n\nYou discovered that small hole on the fence and you want to be recognized for it. The fence team on the other hand knows about dozen, hundreds of such holes. Some are small too, but many are pretty big. And the fence team is working tirelessly at fixing the bigger ones, and there are so many, and so many new are continuously added, they don't expect to ever fix them all.\n\nThat small hole you discovered is just another one, and is added to the pile. It may be important to address right now, but it may also be just a symptom of a bigger problem. You are fixated on your small hole because it's your hole, not because you have a good picture of all the holes there are.\n\nOne of easiest thing in cybersecurity is to find security issues. Any member of the dedicated fence team can name dozen of them. Heck, you can ask the staff on the floor they would know too. What takes time and effort is prioritizing and fixing them.",

But most reasonably people can see the value in what you did, if not they would be burglarized, and that a reward is reasonable. The alternative is there is little incentive for you to report issues to the homeowner. No, you cannot expect everybody to just do this kind of work for free just because \"it's the right thing to do\". You cannot expect random people to come audit your home on a regular basis and provide free feedback for you.\n\nYou could decide that you don't care, and will not give out rewards regardless. But you will lose that aspect of security. You cannot expect that with a sufficiently good security program that you will completely mitigate all risks incurred from not having a bug bounty program. If things worked like that, no company would ever have a breach. That doesn't mean having a bug bounty will make you perfectly secure, its just another part of security, another layer in the swiss cheese model.\n\nSince bug bounty programs aren't easy to setup or maintain, lots of hours have to go into replicating and verifying the risk and impact of each submitted bounty, and theres gonna be a lot of bullshit, its not reasonable to expect all organizations of any size to run them. But they do have a place.",

Weigh that against being able to police your people 24/7, 7 days a week, for the full year without any technological roadblocks. The benefit of having all that data to solve/investigate the most pressing immediate issues: domestic terrorism, groups you don't like, criminals, every police investigation with an encrypted device/application. Those benefits far exceed the cost of losing some info to China every once in a while. The truly important state secrets can be kept off the internet entirely, in secure facilities.\n\nYou can point at instances where adversaries benefit all you want. But in the back of those government officials mind's, all they can think of is how useful this has been to establish control over information, despite a few instances where adversaries were able to benefit somewhat.",

We’re stuck redoing half of their reports because they lack the hands on experience in our domain to understand our actual stack. I have received great resources from them in the past, but the quality drop has been insane over the last few months or so.\n\nIs anyone here been in a similar position as me?

The client had each of the Big 4 doing work for them in one part of their business. Each had an army and after 2 years, none of them had delivered on anything. So the client asked us to get involved. The Big 4 promptly got booted out and we were given the work. We ultimately scrapped everything (cheaper than figuring out how to salvage anything) and we got it all done in about 4 months. Afterwards we were at the corporate office and I joked with senior leadership that we offer cybersecurity janitorial services (we clean up others' messes). They chuckled and then complained about the rates we charged. I just asked them how much did they pay the Big 4 for 2 years with zero projects completed. I followed it up with they should just pay us to do the work going forward as it will be done on-time, on-budget, and done right. (Ah, the joys of youth). That was 13 years ago and the client still puts a significant amount of money in our pocket every single year. There is a significant amount of hard earned trust and respect between us. \n\nTLDR: Our rates may be a bit higher but we deliver.\n\nI do recommend considering boutique firms as you can get exceptional service and a quality product for usually a relatively competitive rate.",

They acqui-hired local specialists through the boom period, and anyone senior quit to go do the same thing, for better clients/engagements and more money either solo or for boutique’s.\n\nAI then made its way into every level of consulting at Big 4 and now even their audit function is cancerous, we’re just waiting for the eventual radiation to start once they’re found out. It’s happened to a few regional offices, who’ve completely gutted the function and lost hundreds of millions of contracts,m..\n\n.. But yeah, long story short; the big boys got hooked on cheap revenue through title inflation for juniors, created a culture of misrepresentation, which is now being propped up and accelerated by slop.\n\nBoutique, regional and independents are the only way to go now. If your partner is owned by private equity or big 4; run.\n\nMy only recommendation is to ask those in the field near you who they’d hire, and then go with the firm who’s over represented by SME’s in the field you’re hiring.

I work mostly in offensive security, penetration testing, etc. and almost all of the ones I've encountered are woefully sub-par when it comes to technical ability. \n\nThere are of course great people there, but given how many consultants they have it's unsurprising that the average is pretty low.  \n\nI own a offensive security company - and have worked in the industry for \\~20 years, and am from a very technical background (and still even do testing/VR), so feel that I have the ability to judge this pretty well. \n\nHaving said all that, almost all of the people I've met from big4 are very good consultants in general and while technically perhaps aren't super awesome, they really do blend a lot of parts into the package to be just that, consultants. From my friends who have worked at the big consultancy firms, I'm not surprised that all this seems to be the case as their job requirements also often involve soft-selling and other non-technical requirements too.\n\nTake everything I've said with a pinch of salt because I personally haven't worked at a big4.\n\nMy overall recommendation is to go with small-mid sized companies. Independent contractors - especially for penetration testing - are likely not a good idea. Pentesters will often use contractors/associates to do their work and naturally go through a selection process to ensure the standard is up to scratch and that reports/work is QA'd and meeting a particular standard too.\n\nMy general sense is that small-independent companies that have a good reputation are the best companies to go with - ideally before they've been bought out by bigger companies.\n\nAnother thing to note is that smaller/mid-sized companies are often very much more focused on establishing and keeping a good relationship with their clients - big4 can really take or leave any contracts that are not hitting the millions pretty easily and not sweat it too badly.\n\nI don't know if you're specifically talking about pentesting/offensive security stuff - but I guess my experience in this particular area is replicated across others too.\n\nHope this helps.",

The associates are thrown under the bus and told to go support this client the day they start.  At another company, I worked with someone who had spent years with a Big 4.  He said the second day he was there he was told to fly to a client and one of the other people there would help him learn what he needed to do.\n\nThis model chews through associates at a very high rate of turnover, at most a couple of years.  Then they leave for places with less pressure and just an overall better culture.  \n\nThe ones that stay tend to have the goal of making partner as fast as they can, though a few choose to go down the senior non-partner path for things like director positions.

I like the \"Incompetent cyber professionals hide behind compliance, policy, and authority\" narrative.\n\nIn his essay \"Why I am an Atheist\", when talking about faith, Bhagat Singh says \"But mere faith and blind faith is dangerous; it dulls the brain, and makes a man reactionary. A man who claims to be a realist has to challenge the whole of the ancient faith. If it does not stand the onslaught of reason it crumbles down.\"\n\nSimilarly, if you, the cyber professional, cannot answer 5 Whys about your policies, security controls, or your security solutions, people stop paying attention to you, your voice loses value. If the only thing that comes to your mind is \"this is policy\", you are the problem.\n\n\nNow that you have identified the problem, start working towards a solution. Develop some empathy, walk a mile in the opposite person's shoes, understand what they are trying to do, how can you help to make their job/task/activity safe. If you don't know, be honest. I do not know everything. Nobody is putting a gun to your head and demanding an answer right away.

For example, if an application works fine and the design is useful, then you know that UX/UI and developers are doing their job. \n\nAnd people try to extrapolate the same premise to security. If you were never hacked, people assume your security is good (either because your employees have the proper awareness or your security team is doing a fine job). That gives a false sense of security. \n\nBut as we know, that couldn't be farther from reality. You may be secure just because you haven't become a prominent target.

I had to learn their app, their architecture and their requirements in the span of about 30 minutes AND come up with a conclusion about how best to implement. Right after that, I had to spar with the Saleforce teams about their own particular environment, how best to secure it--again, I know fuckall about Salesforce, but had to figure it out on the fly. \n\nThe job forces us to figure shit out really fast and to ask a lot of questions to try and get to the bottom of things in the limited time we have. If we don't do a good job, people will put crazy and insecure things into production that will never come out and we'll be on the hook for it. \n\nSo when we start asking questions, a lot of people get turned off because they don't like being questioned and they also don't care for us self-appointed (allegedly) \"geniuses\" that are going to tell them how to change or run the thing they built. \n\nReally, I rarely find myself as disliked; I try to get people to understand why we're doing what we do and demonstrate the value, tell them that if we sort things out before they go into production, their lives will be easier, they won't be sitting on liability, etc. Most people are cool with it. The ones who get shitty are usually some project manager or business lead who wants to put their POS app into production in like three days and gets their undies in a wad because we tell them that their stuff is terrible. However, had they engaged us at the beginning and not the end, we'd have helped them avoid the whole mess. Now they want an exception so they can hit the golive date for their piece of fetid dogshit.

Skills: A lot of cyber guys simply don't have enough engineering skills to earn the respect of developers, also related to #1. This also goes the other way, too. How many cyber teams out there are staffed with glorified sysadmins who on;y know how to manage vendor solutions, not real hackers? How many cyber engineers don't really know linux, or deep network internals, etc?\n3. Culture: The team of \"no\", instead of \"yes, and\" - or better stated - allow us to derisk where you are trying to go. A world of bureaucracy and process, instead of paved roads with guiderails. tl;dr, too much friction, not enough consideration of the \"user experience\" - be it for developers, endusers, customers, etc.\n\nIn a world where cyber professionals were more calculated about risk and had deeper skills across the stack, I think they would be a lot more respected.\n\nSource: used to own cyber function in a smaller org, now don't work in cyber in a large org and see it from both sides.",

I mean, the responsibility has always been on individual organizations to secure themselves, but organizations like NIST and MITRE have made it cheaper and easier for them by vetting, centralizing, and prioritizing crucial information.

Now that it's being dismantled, things will get worse for our colleagues on the ground trying to defend organizations like your local hospitals, schools and utilities.\n\nThis is everything that foreign threat actors could have hoped for. Life is going to be more chaotic and IT and OT systems will be less reliable. It will put people at risk, and it will definitely cost the economy.

          "text": "I only saw one person with what I think is the right answer.\n\nIn my opinion, it would be the Solarwinds attack and here is my rationale.\n\nStuxnet was impressive, but it was a nation state level attack with surgical precision and scope. The one interesting thing about Stuxnet is that due to how sophisticated and how much patience it took at the time, most strategic level systems have adapted several layers of security controls to interrupt an attack like this occuring again.\n\nWannacry was likely the most impactful on a consumer basis and it definitely changed people's perception on how to protect their information.\n\nNotPetya was the most destructive\n\nThe eternalblue exploit that allowed both Wannacry and NotPetya to happen was really just par for course with regards to a big corporation giving a security agency backdoor access to devices. The 2 attacks that happened off the back of it really only served to validate the conspiracy theorists.\n\nBut Solarwinds changed the way security systems had to detect. Up until the solarwinds attack, security had been primarily a signature based detection system, and the only security tools that actually detected something was funky with what was going on with Orion were vendors implementing early heuristics based detection. This also changed the threat vector prioprioritisations worldwide. Realising suddenly that your greatest cybersecurity risk could be your most trusted vendor was a hard pill to swallow for everyone.\n\nThe Solarwinds attack compromised more government systems and critical infrastructure than any other attack, and not in a wanton destruction kinda way like NotPetya did. I believe that because of the solarwinds attack, we're unlikely to see attacks like Stuxnet succeed again, as the higher level attacks that do succeed to find a way in typically opt for a smash and grab style of attack more than any particular goal. This might also be due to advancements in things like bandwidth where prioritising large data sets over strategic targets makes more sense, but either way, Solarwinds attack caused the biggest individual shift in cybersecurity out of the big ones.",

Back in 2023, they had a massive data leak, which exposed really sensitive information. When they were investigated, they found records of Optus investing their funds into more bullshit rather than investing in their cybersecurity infrastructure, which pressured the CEO to step down. Optus was one of the main examples that brought in new cybersecurity laws regarding company negligence. Later last year, 3 emergency service outages happened, where Optus was the main company contracted by the government to maintain emergency service calls. This time it wasn't a cyberattack, but just pure negligence just like what happened back in 2023. Two of the main Optus executives resigned after this lmao. After this, new laws were also introduced that forced all telecommunications providers to have a supervisory firm to check if everything is up to date, and finding if certain systems meet certain criteria.",

Pair that with well segmented VLANs that separate device types, I can have some comfort in knowing those lower grade IoT networks don’t pose much of a threat to me so I don’t necessarily honeypot those.  You’d probably get most of the noise from those IoT and guest type networks. But if they just cannot get to other more valuable things, then good!\n\nSo in the early days of honeypot deployment we may have had a few hits like a print server doing a broadcast, or a license server doing a broadcast. You can quickly tune (or stop!) those. After than the alerts are quite quiet and when we do get one we take full notice of it.",

If they log in as admin, they hacked the prod server and that's a crime, a good reason to fire them. If someone else logs in, that's a compromise.

It's mostly just the hyperscalers, three-letter-agencies, and dedicated security companies who can justify the resources for that kind of thing. It's not a profit center, after all.
