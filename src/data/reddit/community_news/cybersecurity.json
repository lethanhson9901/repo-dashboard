      "text": "[https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/cisa-madhu-gottumukkala-chatgpt-00749361](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/cisa-madhu-gottumukkala-chatgpt-00749361)\n\n>  \nThe interim head of the country’s cyber defense agency uploaded sensitive contracting documents into a public version of ChatGPT last summer, triggering multiple automated security warnings that are meant to stop the theft or unintentional disclosure of government material from federal networks, according to four Department of Homeland Security officials with knowledge of the incident.\n\n>The apparent misstep from Madhu Gottumukkala was especially noteworthy because the acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had requested special permission from CISA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer to use the popular AI tool soon after arriving at the agency this May, three of the officials said. The app was blocked for other DHS employees at the time.\n\n>None of the files Gottumukkala plugged into ChatGPT were classified, according to the four officials, each of whom was granted anonymity for fear of retribution. But the material included CISA contracting documents marked “for official use only,” a government designation for information that is considered sensitive and not for public release.\n\n>Cybersecurity sensors at CISA flagged the uploads this past August, said the four officials. One official specified there were multiple such warnings in the first week of August alone. Senior officials at DHS subsequently led an internal review to assess if there had been any harm to government security from the exposures, according to two of the four officials.\n\n>It is not clear what the review concluded.\n\n>In an emailed statement, CISA’s Director of Public Affairs Marci McCarthy said Gottumukkala “was granted permission to use ChatGPT with DHS controls in place,” and that “this use was short-term and limited.” McCarthy added that the agency was committed to “harnessing AI and other cutting-edge technologies to drive government modernization and deliver on” Trump’s executive order [removing barriers to America’s leadership in AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/).\n\n>The email also appeared to dispute the timeline of POLITICO’s reporting: “Acting Director Dr. Madhu Gottumukkala last used ChatGPT in mid-July 2025 under an authorized temporary exception granted to some employees. CISA’s security posture remains to block access to ChatGPT by default unless granted an exception.”\n\n>",

Probably what happened was a random user came up with something amazing, OpenAI siphoned it, (as they do, through cybersecurity methods) it turned out to be extremely important.\n\nSo now the official narrative is “Trump’s cyber security Chief uploaded it accidentally.”\n\nI don’t trust this for a second. People come up with amazing things using AI and it gets swiped. STOLEN.\n\nAsk Suchir Balaji. Oh wait, that’s right, Suchir Balaji is dead.\n\nSomeone should connect these dots before the elite destroy this planet…\n\nElla Cook. Nuno Loureiro, Feng Yanghe, TANG XIAOOU, HE ZHI, ZHANG DAIBING, QUAN YUHUI.\n\nAll dead. All working on high value, high target things. Once their work was completed… DEAD.\n\nIt’s all right there. Nobody cares. People make silly AI pictures and complain about small things like AI stole their pictures, and novels, and videos... It’s sickening.\n\nAI companies steal BIG things.\n\nSuchir Balaji knew that. He was a whistleblower. Now he’s dead. Everyone on this list is dead. How did that happen? Uh, maybe… the government had them murdered?!",

Long story, but the point is that they got rid of the people in charge of modernizing a lot of gov and DOD infrastructure. Systems that would have made it much harder to hide black budgets.",

We show an adversary can extract gigabytes of training data from open-source language models like Pythia or GPT-Neo, semi-open models like LLaMA or Falcon, and closed models like ChatGPT. Existing techniques from the literature suffice to attack unaligned models; in order to attack the aligned ChatGPT, we develop a new divergence attack that causes the model to diverge from its chatbot-style generations and emit training data at a rate 150x higher than when behaving properly. Our methods show practical attacks can recover far more data than previously thought, and reveal that current alignment techniques do not eliminate memorization.",

If you disable biometric unlock:\n\n\n\n1. You MUST use a strong passphrase (15+ chars, mixed case). A simple PIN can be brute-forced in seconds during custody.\n\n\n\n2. Consider enabling a \"Duress PIN\" feature if available (newer Android/iOS). This logs you in without alerting the device they cracked it.\n\n\n\n3. Backup authentication factors (security keys, TOTP apps) should be stored separately from your primary device.\n\n\n\n4. The WaPo case highlights law enforcement's legal uncertainty here - they used biometrics in a warrantless seizure, which may not hold up under 5th Amendment challenges (unlike passcodes, which courts treat differently).\n\n\n\nThe real security posture: Layered authentication + understanding your threat model. If LEA is your primary threat, yes disable biometrics. If it's account takeover, keep them enabled with strong backup auth.",

There is a reason mailing lists like Full Disclosure existed and people used aliases to dump bugs they found. Eventually, the getting sued mostly stopped but basically your only reward for a long time was receiving credit on the patch announcement, which got street cred. The bug bounty thing came about after a lot of discussion about how to encourage researchers to report bugs responsibly and reward their efforts.\n\nBug bounty programs still pay very poorly relative to their real world value. You'll never see this change. The reality being that (software esp) security as a whole is viewed as a necessary burden, but budgets and timelines never reflect the real risks involved because it's all preventative. This applies to penetration testing / assessment efforts and bounty payouts. Most companies don't invest what they should to really make their products secure.\n\nThis is all compounded by the amount of work these programs require. People report junk bugs that aren't exploitable then start making demands. It's gotten worse with AI, because now they just run AI and report the bug without ever validating it is actually a bug. I saw several in the Linux kernel reported not long ago and ever single one was AI generated, none were real bugs. This creates a lot of work, but it also predates AI when people would run fuzzers and just report stuff without ever testing it. If people stopped reporting low effort crap then maybe these programs could improve as the cost to maintain them went down.",

The other end, though, is what's causing the problem: uber-low-quality irrelevant or false positive bug reports, often directly pipelined from commercial security scanners (sometimes slightly modded) into LLMs and into our inbox, in hopes of collecting bounties, at traffic volumes that end up requiring additional headcounts just to deal with. The stuff that curl has been dealing with isn't just them, it's a plague. \n\nBy offering bounties, what industry hoped to do was give talented security researchers who found flaws an avenue to benefit from their discoveries *without* doing illegal and harmful things. But what has ended up happening is the creation of a perverse incentive system that rewards a different kind of bad actor - the scripted \"bug finder and reporter\" running on a VPS, with a conversion rate somewhere around 0.0001%, generating tens of thousands of wasted work hours per year.\n\nCollecting bug bounties was never meant to be *an industry*.",

The benefit they get to see all data far outweighs the cost. Whats a few instances of China being able to snoop compared against having unimpeded access to all of your populace's data?\n\nEven if China benefits, lets say 1 time every 3 years, and is able to snoop into something they shouldn't have. Weigh that against being able to police your people 24/7, 7 days a week, for the full year without any technological roadblocks. The benefit of having all that data to solve/investigate the most pressing immediate issues: domestic terrorism, groups you don't like, criminals, every police investigation with an encrypted device/application. Those benefits far exceed the cost of losing some info to China every once in a while. The truly important state secrets can be kept off the internet entirely, in secure facilities.\n\nYou can point at instances where adversaries benefit all you want. But in the back of those government officials mind's, all they can think of is how useful this has been to establish control over information, despite a few instances where adversaries were able to benefit somewhat.",

The mandatory shortening of SSL cert lifetimes is 100% because the browser & CA vendors don't want to fix cert revocation, even though we have fixed the problem.\n\nWhat exact risk do short-lived certs address if not revocation?  There isn't one, because allowing 1 year certs (forgetting we used to have 2-5 years without issue) was never an issue.  They'll coo about \"Oh but what if your private key is compromised?\" which is, again, a revocation issue, and also a hypothetical scenario that has failed to be realized into a real issue.",

      "text": "I've been working for 2 years as a mid-level manager for a medium-sized fintech company based somewhere in Asia. I work as an individual contributor reporting directly to the CISO though my tasks require me to work a lot cross-functionally with other team members.\n\nI accomplished a lot with our previous CISO before he left the company mid last year. Then around 6 months ago, a new chief came in. It turns out that he was previously a CISO of one of the largest fintech companies globally which I'm sure everyone here has heard of. Apparently, the CEO knew him when they worked together in the previous conpany.\n\nWe worked in different regional offices and barely spoke in the first 2-3 months despite me actively reaching out to him several times. He didn't set any weekly meetings with me or the broader team, nor he even tried to understand what my tasks were and learn about the current state of things.\n\nOftentimes, I would DM him to get an approval or an update, but he wouldn't respond until a day or two. He would just reply 'OK' or totally ignore my messages. Naturally, I was pissed but I just continued my daily BAU tasks.\n\nHe's Chinese (which I don't speak), but he understood and spoke English well enough on a conversational level.\n\nAround 3 months in, he started becoming a bit more active. We started having weekly updates with him, however, he also asked me and his other direct reports to report directly to the president. He let us do the updates on our own per team and sometimes he wouldn't speak a single word throughout the call. This pissed a lot of us since we all understood that it should be his job as CISO. All directives came from the president and he never started any initiatives on his own. Basically, he just let us do whatever we want.\n\nAt the start of the year, the audit from our regulator began. Our team was asked to do an overview presentation and he asked us to fill in the slides though the auditor required that it should be him to present it. All he had to do was understand and explain the slides.\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon before the presentation, he sent a group message to all us his direct reports that we should do a write up for him on the slides and we should complete it before the day ends so he can review it (mind you, the presentation was still on Wednesday). I was in utter disbelief when I read this. I was out with my family at the time and won't be back until after dinner. Of course, the rest of the team and I did it for him.\n\nOn the day of the presentation, I was sitting in the office room together with our regulators. He was put on call as he was allowed to do it remotely. To no surprise, he read the write-up word per word like an AI voice-over. It was painfully obvious for everyone in the room, but since we're behind schedule, they just let him be. I could've summarized and explained all the slides by heart.\n\nTo this day, I don't think he understands what the team is doing. They say a CISO's first 100 days should be enough to build a roadmap for the team. We're way past that and we're still nowhere near any semblance of one, and my colleagues already started leaving one by one.\n\nThat's all he is to me -- a decorative wallflower.\n\nAny ideas on how to deal with this situation?",

A man who claims to be a realist has to challenge the whole of the ancient faith. If it does not stand the onslaught of reason it crumbles down.\"\n\nSimilarly, if you, the cyber professional, cannot answer 5 Whys about your policies, security controls, or your security solutions, people stop paying attention to you, your voice loses value. If the only thing that comes to your mind is \"this is policy\", you are the problem.\n\n\nNow that you have identified the problem, start working towards a solution. Develop some empathy, walk a mile in the opposite person's shoes, understand what they are trying to do, how can you help to make their job/task/activity safe. If you don't know, be honest. I do not know everything. Nobody is putting a gun to your head and demanding an answer right away.

For example, if an application works fine and the design is useful, then you know that UX/UI and developers are doing their job. \n\nAnd people try to extrapolate the same premise to security. If you were never hacked, people assume your security is good (either because your employees have the proper awareness or your security team is doing a fine job). That gives a false sense of security. \n\nBut as we know, that couldn't be farther from reality. You may be secure just because you haven't become a prominent target. But that can change fast as well as your exposure.\n\nSo unfortunately, sometimes you need to wait until something really bad happens in order to make security relevant.",

I had to learn their app, their architecture and their requirements in the span of about 30 minutes AND come up with a conclusion about how best to implement. Right after that, I had to spar with the Saleforce teams about their own particular environment, how best to secure it--again, I know fuckall about Salesforce, but had to figure it out on the fly. \n\nThe job forces us to figure shit out really fast and to ask a lot of questions to try and get to the bottom of things in the limited time we have. If we don't do a good job, people will put crazy and insecure things into production that will never come out and we'll be on the hook for it. \n\nSo when we start asking questions, a lot of people get turned off because they don't like being questioned and they also don't care for us self-appointed (allegedly) \"geniuses\" that are going to tell them how to change or run the thing they built. \n\nReally, I rarely find myself as disliked; I try to get people to understand why we're doing what we do and demonstrate the value, tell them that if we sort things out before they go into production, their lives will be easier, they won't be sitting on liability, etc. Most people are cool with it. The ones who get shitty are usually some project manager or business lead who wants to put their POS app into production in like three days and gets their undies in a wad because we tell them that their stuff is terrible. However, had they engaged us at the beginning and not the end, we'd have helped them avoid the whole mess. Now they want an exception so they can hit the golive date for their piece of fetid dogshit. Those people are jerks because they're morons. Those two personality traits often go hand in hand.",

The only calculus is in \"best practices\", \"vibes\", or thoughtlessly following NIST 800-53 or other frameworks (e.g., mandating password changes in 2026 when paired with strong MFA -- assuming no evidence of compromise).\n2. Skills: A lot of cyber guys simply don't have enough engineering skills to earn the respect of developers, also related to #1. This also goes the other way, too. How many cyber teams out there are staffed with glorified sysadmins who on;y know how to manage vendor solutions, not real hackers? How many cyber engineers don't really know linux, or deep network internals, etc?\n3. Culture: The team of \"no\", instead of \"yes, and\" - or better stated - allow us to derisk where you are trying to go. A world of bureaucracy and process, instead of paved roads with guiderails. tl;dr, too much friction, not enough consideration of the \"user experience\" - be it for developers, endusers, customers, etc.\n\nIn a world where cyber professionals were more calculated about risk and had deeper skills across the stack, I think they would be a lot more respected.\n\nSource: used to own cyber function in a smaller org, now don't work in cyber in a large org and see it from both sides.",

I mean, the responsibility has always been on individual organizations to secure themselves, but organizations like NIST and MITRE have made it cheaper and easier for them by vetting, centralizing, and prioritizing crucial information.

Now that it's being dismantled, things will get worse for our colleagues on the ground trying to defend organizations like your local hospitals, schools and utilities.\n\nThis is everything that foreign threat actors could have hoped for. Life is going to be more chaotic and IT and OT systems will be less reliable. It will put people at risk, and it will definitely cost the economy.

          "text": "I only saw one person with what I think is the right answer.\n\nIn my opinion, it would be the Solarwinds attack and here is my rationale.\n\nStuxnet was impressive, but it was a nation state level attack with surgical precision and scope. The one interesting thing about Stuxnet is that due to how sophisticated and how much patience it took at the time, most strategic level systems have adapted several layers of security controls to interrupt an attack like this occuring again.\n\nWannacry was likely the most impactful on a consumer basis and it definitely changed people's perception on how to protect their information.\n\nNotPetya was the most destructive\n\nThe eternalblue exploit that allowed both Wannacry and NotPetya to happen was really just par for course with regards to a big corporation giving a security agency backdoor access to devices. The 2 attacks that happened off the back of it really only served to validate the conspiracy theorists.\n\nBut Solarwinds changed the way security systems had to detect. Up until the solarwinds attack, security had been primarily a signature based detection system, and the only security tools that actually detected something was funky with what was going on with Orion were vendors implementing early heuristics based detection. This also changed the threat vector prioprioritisations worldwide. Realising suddenly that your greatest cybersecurity risk could be your most trusted vendor was a hard pill to swallow for everyone.\n\nThe Solarwinds attack compromised more government systems and critical infrastructure than any other attack, and not in a wanton destruction kinda way like NotPetya did. I believe that because of the solarwinds attack, we're unlikely to see attacks like Stuxnet succeed again, as the higher level attacks that do succeed to find a way in typically opt for a smash and grab style of attack more than any particular goal. This might also be due to advancements in things like bandwidth where prioritising large data sets over strategic targets makes more sense, but either way, Solarwinds attack caused the biggest individual shift in cybersecurity out of the big ones.",

These all brought awareness to a lot of people who would otherwise be unaware/uninformed of the threats.\n\nYou also had the attacks that may not be known so well in public, but sent shivers down the spine of tech people/governments, like NotPetya, Solar Winds, XZ-Utils & Stuxnet.",

Optus is a part of the big three mobile network providers in Australia, in fact, they almost hold a triopoly alongside telstra and vodaphone. Back in 2023, they had a massive data leak, which exposed really sensitive information. When they were investigated, they found records of Optus investing their funds into more bullshit rather than investing in their cybersecurity infrastructure, which pressured the CEO to step down. Optus was one of the main examples that brought in new cybersecurity laws regarding company negligence. Later last year, 3 emergency service outages happened, where Optus was the main company contracted by the government to maintain emergency service calls. This time it wasn't a cyberattack, but just pure negligence just like what happened back in 2023. Two of the main Optus executives resigned after this lmao. After this, new laws were also introduced that forced all telecommunications providers to have a supervisory firm to check if everything is up to date, and finding if certain systems meet certain criteria.",

Pair that with well segmented VLANs that separate device types, I can have some comfort in knowing those lower grade IoT networks don’t pose much of a threat to me so I don’t necessarily honeypot those.  You’d probably get most of the noise from those IoT and guest type networks. But if they just cannot get to other more valuable things, then good!\n\nSo in the early days of honeypot deployment we may have had a few hits like a print server doing a broadcast, or a license server doing a broadcast. You can quickly tune (or stop!) those. After than the alerts are quite quiet and when we do get one we take full notice of it.",

If they log in as admin, they hacked the prod server and that's a crime, a good reason to fire them. If someone else logs in, that's a compromise.

Getting them to do anything differently than they know is a nightmare). We've basically just operated by trust that the clients we work with aren't intending to hack us. I want to heighten security because even in the best case scenario that we fully trust them, they could have reused a USB drive from anywhere.\n\nAside from testing them in a burner computer (not very scalable for an office of non-tech literate people), is there any kind of device you can get that tests if the USB stick has anything other than storage that doesn't execute anything on it? If it does need a burner computer, is there any software for detecting malicious stuff on a USB that doesn't require you to be tech savvy to use (I can set it up, it's not feasible for me to test every time though)?",
