It's less of an issue if the AI breaks something, as long as it can detect that it has done so and restore things to how they were before a human has had time to react.

Kiro had operator-level permissions, no mandatory peer review, and no enforcement boundary between \"I am authorized to be here\" and \"I am authorized to do this.\" Those are two completely different things and almost nobody is treating them differently yet.​\n\nAmazon called it user error. Technically they are right. But \"user error\" in an agentic world is a policy failure, not a human failure. The human made a mistake with permissions once. The agent executed that mistake at machine speed, without hesitation, without a second thought, across a production environment. Thirteen hours.\n\nI built [MarkdownLM](https://markdownlm.com/) specifically for this gap. Not at the permissions layer, IAM and least-privilege are your infrastructure team's job. But at the policy layer, the layer that says \"even if you are authorized to touch this, here are the rules for how you touch it, and here is the gate that validates your output before it executes.\" That layer does not exist in most teams' workflows right now. The Kiro incident is what happens when it does not.",

Read-only actions go through. Anything that changes state has to present evidence first (dry-run/diff) and stay within a bounded scope. Truly destructive operations are blocked by default unless there’s explicit, time-limited approval.

I appreciate the fast follow up.\n\nThe one (lengthy) thing I’ll say about the conflict of interest issue is that while there may not be a conflict (and there doesn’t appear to be one in this case), the audience cannot and should not assume that there isn’t one, especially given the nature of Barrack AI’s business.\n\nIf a pharmaceutical company put out a white paper warning of the ills of a drug offered by competitors and every statement was factual, you’d be at least a bit skeptical even if the white paper didn’t mention the company’s competing product and it was co-written with an independent researcher. Why? Because the company funding the white paper stands to benefit in some way such as a better reputation or monetarily.\n\nAt best, we hope that you are an honest broker leveraging your expertise to help laypeople understand the import of the issues you’re raising. There is a place for customer education and it often does come from vendors, but readers like the ones that frequent this subreddit have to maintain that skepticism to be good stewards of the policies, tools, and practices at their own organization.\n\nWhile, I don’t believe Barrack AI is attempting to scam readers or falsely accuse any one of wrongdoing, we must remain vigilant that other less scrupulous actors will.",

Companies offer such service on a subscription basis, typically granting regular access to one's credit history, alerts of critical changes to one's credit history, and additional services. Credit monitoring can help detect credit related fraud and identity theft.\n\nIn the United States, whenever obtaining one's credit history, or credit monitoring, such services are typically available either as single-bureau service (with data access to only one of the 3 national credit reporting bureaus), or three-bureau service (with access to data to all three national credit reporting bureaus). It is often advisable to see data with all three bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) to detect identity theft.\"",

Since I'm from Germany and you are as well, I'll give you my perspective from a german point of view with absolutely *zero* knowledge about Maltese jurisdiction.\n\nGetting the CSIRT involved immediately was correct and everyone who insists otherwise is... not particularly connected to reality.\n\nYou really, *really*, **really** should not have written that script. You also shouldn't have ran the script. If you had to run the script, you really should have used a VPN. You also really shouldn't have told them about the script.  \nThat wasn't smart, sorry. You should have either created a few accounts and tested on them, or gotten explicit written consent from some of your students to test with their accounts. In the end, you accessed private information about non-consenting individuals.\n\n30 days disclosure time is fine for such a simple vulnerability.\n\nTheir response was as (unfortunately) expected.\n\nSince I have no clue about maltese law, I can't comment on anything there.\n\nFrom a german perspective: Next time you find something disclose it anonymously via the [CCC](https://www.ccc.de/disclosure), [Heise](https://www.heise.de/investigativ/) or [BSI](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/IT-Sicherheitsvorfall/Unternehmen/Ich-moechte-einen-IT-Sicherheitsvorfall-melden/ich-moechte-einen-it-sicherheitsvorfall-melden_node.html). I'd probably go with CCC personally.\n\nI can also recommend to watch [this talk](https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-sicherheitslcke-gefunden-und-nun).\n\nAttention, hot take: You could also just anonymously publicly disclose it. Sucks for the company and the users, but there are good reasons for it, especially here in Germany.\n\nIn the end, the issue got fixed and you didn't get sued, so good job on making the internet a tad safer place.\n\nAlso, the comments under this reddit post kind of shock me.\n\nUnrelated: I like the style of your blog. I hate the writing style of ChatGPT, really unpleasant to read.",

Instead of doing that, he accessed other individuals accounts manually (mild no no) and then wrote a script to pull the information out of MANY accounts (huge no no). \n\nHe performed an unauthorized penetration test and stole personal information from the company (deleting the information afterwards is debatable on whether that helps or hurts his case), tattled on the company to the government, and only then contacted the company (with the government cc’d), and now wants to play the victim?

You’re just painting a target on yourself by going this route. Dias by the engineer is understanding the concept of chain of possession. They found private information exposed publicly, and then took possession of some of that private information by simply running the script to confirm that they could access it. They were transferring that information into their possession and their telegraphing their ignorance about this.\n\nThey should’ve submitted through an anonymous email, they should’ve disclosed to the regulator through that same anonymous email, and they should’ve refrained from speaking about the disclosure until there was a public acknowledgement somewhere, and then they could openly point to it and say, “ I’m shocked this thing happened,” and detached themselves entirely from the disclosure process.",

That's literally the worst scenario possible from a public security perspective. The whole point of responsible disclosure is to try to make sure this never happens.\n\n>If you waste your time trying to tell them, the business will either A.) Try and destroy your life with endless lawsuits, or B.) Try and press charges.  It's like winning the lottery to find a company that will appreciate the help and fix the vulnerability. \n\nOr, you know, you could disclose it anonymously to the business and not face that risk.",

I had not revised networking or fundamentals for about 6 months because recently I’ve been focused mainly on attack workflows and hands-on labs.\n\n\n\nHere are the questions he asked and what I answered:\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is TCP/IP?\n\nI explained that it’s a way devices communicate over the internet. I described the TCP handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and mentioned the four layers of the TCP/IP model.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is DNS cache flooding?\n\nI told him honestly that I didn’t know that part.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is the Data Link Layer?\n\nI said it converts data into frames and handles source and destination MAC addresses.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is the Physical Layer?\n\nI explained it converts data into electrical signals in cables and radio waves in WiFi.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is MITM and how is it performed?\n\nI said it’s when someone intercepts communication between two parties. I gave an example of public WiFi, explained how attackers can read or modify data if communication is not secure (like HTTP), and mentioned Wireshark for capturing network traffic.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is cryptography?\n\nI said it’s a method of protecting data using encryption. I explained symmetric and asymmetric encryption and gave examples like AES, DES, 3DES, and RSA.\n\n\n\nHe asked: Name web application vulnerabilities.\n\nI mentioned XSS, SSRF, and race conditions. When he asked to explain race conditions, I gave a banking example where multiple requests are sent before balance updates. For prevention, I said locking mechanisms or synchronization.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What tools are used in web app testing?\n\nI explained a workflow: recon with Nmap, directory fuzzing with Gobuster, subdomain discovery with ffuf, checking CMS vulnerabilities in Exploit-DB, and exploiting using Metasploit.\n\n\n\nHe said automated scanners can do everything. I responded that automation consumes more resources and cannot detect business logic flaws, which is why manual pentesting is needed.\n\n\n\nHe asked: How would you block a DDoS attack?\n\nI said using firewalls, temporary IP blocking, rate limiting, and monitoring through SIEM tools.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is Cloudflare?\n\nI said it works as a DNS service and proxy and mentioned its public DNS IP.\n\n\n\nHe asked: Do you know cloud security?\n\nI said no.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is SYN flooding and how to prevent it?\n\nI explained sending multiple SYN packets and mentioned prevention like rate limiting, IDS/IPS, and firewalls.\n\n\n\nHe asked: If many users share the same WiFi IP, how would you stop DDoS?\n\nI struggled with a precise answer.\n\n\n\nHe asked: What is CSP and security headers?\n\nI said it’s a server policy header but didn’t know details. I also mentioned X-Forwarded-For and explained it tracks the original client IP behind proxies.\n\n\n\nAt the end, he said: “You only know the names, not the details.”\n\n\n\nThis is what frustrated me because I genuinely tried to explain concepts with examples wherever I could i even said fuck you(in my mind).\n\nI had applied for jr penetration testing role.",

It's pretty similar to what the job would be like if your company provides IR services to other customers/clients. You won't know wtf you're looking at. I've had maybe 5 clients out of hundreds proactively send us a network diagram and full picture of their environment including security relevant applications that are in use. It's almost always here's a few server images, we do our forensics and find XYZ, and then have to ask them if use XYZ, then they tell us XY is used, but Z isn't recognized, then we find Z on a few other hosts and everything keeps going from there. Theres a lot of back and forth between us as we slowly piece together findings, particularly for things where there can be both a legitimate and malicious use case and we don't know whether they're using it legit or not. \n\nI expect that part of those interviews involves you asking the interviewer questions of your own where you need additional context. But I would only expect someone aiming for a mid-senior level role to go through an IR interview like this. Entry level without prior industry experience would struggle with this kind of interview cos they lack actual hands on experience with real cases. You can ask them basic questions, and expect basic responses and follow up questions, but you shouldn't expect too much.",

I'm more interested in hearing how they approach the problem as a whole. What do they consider? What don't they consider? What dont they know, and how do they tackle a problem they're not 100% sure how to solve?\n\nIMO, after establishing a baseline knowledge level, it's more important to see how someone handles a complex, unknown problem. Therefore I'll try to gauge where someone's skill level ends, then intentionally ask them questions beyond their capabilities. I'm not looking for the right answer; I'm looking for the right thought process even if it ends in the wrong or incomplete answer. You're going to run into a completely new-to-you problem eventually in this field. Therefore the problem solving process matters more than someone's ability to recall an answer perfectly.\n\nSo going back to my question earlier:\n\nIf they answer the question perfectly, I'll follow up with a harder question until we get to an area they're unfamiliar with. I do also tell them openly why I'm asking what I do and that I'd rather them try and give me the wrong answer than not try at all.\n\nIf they don't know how to answer the question perfectly, I'd want to see what they think about. I'll see if/how they try to approach things like network segmentation, hardening methods for the web server itself, IDS/IPS implementation, and most importantly the why and how of it all. \n\nFor me the worst answer is \"I don't know\", and the best answer is \"I don't know but I'd like to take a stab at it. I know x, and I think I can translate it to y using z...\" Again even if they're wrong, I get to see how they tackle a new problem to them.\n\nI'm of the opinion it's much easier to teach someone technical skills or knowledge they're missing than it is to teach someone how to think, research, or solve problems.",

Any idiot can memorise a bunch of facts and data points, which is why relying on certifications as proof of skill is a foolish idea. Any interviewer asking for parrot answers that can be Googled is a huge red flag. Any interview that allows you to showcase your thought process and how you solve problems is a sign the hiring company knows what they're doing.",

Not great, but ok.\n\nPassword field contains asterisks.

It's better to have people bring it to you than spread it around. \n\nAnd as a TP-Link customer, I would love for them to get it right. They should never store a password, ever. Only hashes of passwords. \n\nOn this page there is a paragraph with the heading \"Engagement with the security community\" which has an email address you can raise your concerns to. They may say you had credentials so it's not a security issue (it is though), or they may release a fix for it.\n\nhttps://www.tp-link.com/us/landing/security-commitment/",

Many of us who operate regulated environments appreciate the early disclosures we often get from each other in IRC, Discord, various subreddits, etc... and I've often been made aware of and acted on issues *long* before vendors acknowledged/fixed those issues in the past.\n\nI know it's a potential black eye for the vendor, but for my admin team and cybersecurity, we've been glad to have been made aware in advance so we can take action early.

Cisco for example has an additional config line to enable storing passwords in an encrypted fashion, but that would imply it can also be decrypted again rather than it being a hashed password that you can't get back, and also that it is not even the default.\n\nOn most network gear in businesses you should just be disabling the password logon and managing the devices with ssh keys or a radius server with some kind of federated auth.",

It is starting to change in recent years to some more common good practice things (new versions of Cisco switches will have MD5 hashing enabled for the password, old versions defaulted to plain text with the option to enable it).\n\nI am struggling to find information about why this is but I suspect its a \"if the attacker can get this config you are already screwed\" so they dont stand to gain much from a single network device password. Enterprise firewalls are all a bit better than switches for security as they were always perimeter devices and therefore part of the keep keeping attackers out of the network to begin with.\n\nRegardless with or without a password, physical access makes it incredibly easy for anyone to walk in, wipe and reconfigure network equipment to their own gain as all of these devices have some way to wipe them without a password, or in some older cases just remove the password from the config entirely to gain unauthed access.",

No breach. No hack. The integrations just worked exactly as built.\n\nUsers handed over government IDs to prove they were old enough to use a chat app. Three vendors down the chain, that data ended up somewhere they never agreed to.\n\nAnd this is the part that gets me. We dump money into firewalls, EDR, SIEM. All of it pointed at the front door. But this vendor had legitimate access. The data moved through approved integrations. Nothing flagged because nothing broke.\n\nI keep thinking about this: most teams I know can't tell you what their users did in the browser yesterday. Which apps they logged into. Where files went. Not because they're bad at their jobs. The tooling was never built to look there.\n\nFirewalls see the network. EDR sees the endpoint. The browser is where work actually happens and most orgs have nothing watching it. AND honestly I'd bet most companies have no idea what theirs is doing either.",

Same code, same data, now on a sheet of paper. When asked why, the explanation is \"Chinese hackers.\" A consultancy warned them. So the defensive move is to downgrade a digital system into a 1998 office workflow and pretend this is cybersecurity.\n\nGo to China and you cannot move without a QR code. Transport, payments, buildings, government services. No paper, no drama, no pretending scanners can tell the difference between a phone screen and a printer. It works because the system is designed for reality, not fear. Imagine trying to implement that here. They’d commission a consultancy. The consultancy would recommend buying 50,000 printers. Every airport, every port of entry, every office stacked with paper so officials can \"securely\" scan digital codes off dead trees. This is how Britain is broken.",

Who has access? What's the retention policy? What happens when (not if) it gets breached? The fact that they're \"pausing\" suggests they didn't have good answers.\n\nThe broader problem is there's no industry standard for privacy-preserving age verification.

Soroor Ghandali is accused of transferring numerous files as well, with prosecutors claiming the data later turned up on personal devices and other systems connected to the group.\n\nAuthorities say the alleged scheme went beyond simple downloads, with steps taken to hide the activity, including destroying records, submitting false statements, and even photographing screens rather than moving documents directly.\n\nKhosravi, who is married to Samaneh Ghandali, is accused of coordinating with the sisters and accessing sensitive information through his own unnamed employer.\n\nA spokesperson at Google told The Register:.\n\n\"We have enhanced safeguards to protect our confidential information and immediately alerted law enforcement after discovering this incident. Today's indictments are an important step towards accountability and we'll continue working to ensure our trade secrets remain secure.\"\n\nLaw enforcement officials were keen to frame the case as more than just an internal corporate spat. \"The alleged actions outlined in this indictment reflect a calculated betrayal of trust by individuals accused of stealing trade secrets from the very tech companies that employed them. According to the allegations, the method in which confidential data was transferred by the defendants involved deliberate steps to evade detection and conceal their identities,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani.\n\n\"Protecting Silicon Valley innovation and defending the groundbreaking technologies that drive our economy and national security is a top priority for the FBI. We will continue to work with our private sector partners to hold accountable anyone who seeks to unlawfully exploit American ingenuity,\" he added.\"",

They must have been pocketing the difference between the government paying for what they thought were British cleared programmers and totally-not-selling-information-to-the-FSB overseas labor.\n\n> The inquiry discovered that the firm that outsourced the work – on a staff intranet for nuclear submarine engineers – to Russia and Belarus initially kept it secret and discussed whether it could disguise where the workers were based by giving them fake names of dead British people.\n\nIn the US, these are the criminal charges I can immediately think of:\n\n- 18 U.S. Code § 1028 - Fraud and related activity in connection with identification documents, authentication features, and information\n\n- 18 U.S. Code § 286 - Conspiracy to defraud the Government with respect to claims \n\n- 18 U.S. Code § 371 - Conspiracy to commit offense or to defraud United States\n\n- ITAR violations, which have consequences up to: $1 million and/or 20 years' imprisonment per violation, and debarment from future government work.",

According to researcher “Celeste” the exposed code, which has now been removed, sat at a US government-authorized endpoint that appears to have been isolated from its regular work environment.\n\n> In those files, the researchers found details about the extensive surveillance Persona software performs on its users. Beyond checking their age, the software performs 269 distinct verification checks, runs facial recognition against watchlists and politically exposed persons, screens “adverse media” across 14 categories (including terrorism and espionage), and assigns risk and similarity scores.\n\n> Persona collects—and can retain for up to three years—IP addresses, browser and device fingerprints, government ID numbers, phone numbers, names, faces, plus a battery of “selfie” analytics like suspicious-entity detection, pose repeat detection, and age inconsistency checks.\n\nInformation leakage aside, it is depressing to see countries barrel towards China's mandatory identity link with online accounts.\n\nI had a friend back in college who said one of their friends in the PRC once criticized a local government official on social media.

It might not even be outright dismantling freedom of speech (or other rights), all it takes is spreading enough worries for people to self-censor and avoid discussing day-to-day societal issues.\n\nTime and time again we see examples of data breaches or badly built infrastructure, which means no single entity can be trusted to keep data safe, to not exploit the data, to not have bad actors access it, to not result in future harm.\n\nIt might be low risk to share your personal opinion today. In 10 years, someone might track you down because of that and drag you in front of a court. \n\nIt's never about today, it's about tomorrow. It's not about \"what if\", it's about \"when\".\n\nDiscord especially is very popular among various political groups and social movements. Not all of them are pedophiles or neo-nazis, I would even argue the vast majority are left leaning groups. \n\nBest worst case would be people being targeted for their political opinions in the near future, as governments turn their agencies into vindictive oppressive tools. Worst worst case would be people being executed.\n\nSociety is way too naive imho. Which is why we can't back down and allow such developments to happen and infiltrate our lives continuously. \n\nEven if there is a slight chance to improve and save lives thanks to complete surveillance, the sacrifice are still immense. So many innocent people are currently and will suffer just because the wrong people are in positions of power and are using every possibility to silence and dispose of anyone who isn't supporting human rights violations.\n\nWe are absolutely setting up a dystopian future if we continue down this path and there will be few options left to fight it, the more ground is lost.",

He also raided the mini-bars and didn't settle some of those tabs, police say.\n\n\"This cyberattack was specifically designed to alter the payment validation system, and this is the first time we have detected a crime using this method,\" Spain's National Police told media outlets.\n\nThe man, a 20-year-old Spanish national, was arrested while staying at a Madrid hotel with a four-night reservation that carried a €4,000 ($4,716) price tag – unless you hacked the payment system, as this fraudster did.\n\nAccording to the cops, he stayed at this hotel several times, costing the business more than €20,000 ($23,608) in losses.\n\nPolice began investigating the suspect earlier this month after an unnamed online booking website reported suspicious activity. The transactions appeared normal, indicating the man paid the full amount – at first.\n\nDays later, however, when the site transferred the actual amount paid to the hotel, the payment-validation scam surfaced, indicating that the crook paid just one cent for rooms costing €1,000 ($1,179) per night.\n\nAdding insult to injury, police said that the man also consumed mini-bar bottles and sometimes left those bills unpaid, too. \n\nWhile he may be facing a free stay at a mini-bar free, unluxurious facility for his alleged crimes, we have an idea for his next big vacay, post-prison: an inflatable moon hotel.\n\nThe definitely-going-to-happen hotel, slated to open in 2032, requires a deposit of either $250,000 or $1 million. No word on whether GRU Space, the hotel's operators, have received any one cent deposits – yet.\"",

You’ll continue to have people who have 0 clue what they’re doing attempt to conduct attacks (while in many cases probably being compromised themselves). \n\nThe difference now is that you’ll see some of those people evolve into “AI agent kiddies” as you said. Who will quite probably still have minimal idea of what they’re doing, but could leverage a sufficiently unrestricted AI to generate malicious code. They’re still unlikely to pose an enormous threat, but they could definitely do more damage. \n\nThe real problem is capable hackers who get access to AIs which are capable & unrestricted. Although AV software is getting much more capable with dynamic analysis, the fundamental structure of AVs is built off years worth of IoC data. A capable AI could pretty much replicate malicious code with slight tweaks, to avoid the static detections/weak dynamic detections. Or worse, a capable AI will no doubt eventually be able to create new variants of malicious code, or automate attacks in ways defenders aren’t prepared for.",
