          "text": "\"What policy wonk wouldn't want to click on an attachment promising to unveil US plans for Venezuela? Chinese cyberspies used just such a lure to target US government agencies and policy-related organizations in a phishing campaign that began just days after an American military operation captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nAcronis Threat Research Unit discovered the campaign after finding a zip file named \"US now deciding what's next for Venezuela\" uploaded in early January to VirusTotal. It contained a legitimate executable and a hidden, DLL-based backdoor called Lotuslite.\n\nThis combination, along with other factors such as infrastructure and technical overlaps, helped the security sleuths attribute the phishing campaign with \"moderate confidence\" to a Beijing-backed espionage crew called Mustang Panda (aka UNC6384, Twill Typhoon).\n\nUS law enforcement and cyber agents have tracked Mustang Panda for years, and blamed the snoops for breaking into \"numerous government and private organizations\" in the US, Europe, and the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nIn a Thursday report, Acronis' threat hunters detailed the crew's latest campaign and provided a technical analysis of its new Lotuslite malware. One of the authors, threat intelligence research lead Santiago Pontiroli, said it's unknown if the PRC spies successfully compromised any targeted computers.\n\n\"This was a precise, targeted campaign, not a wide-reaching or random attack. The targeting appears selective rather than broad spray and pray,\" Pontiroli told The Register.\n\n\"The threat actor responsible fits into a broader pattern of ongoing cyberespionage activity that is opportunistic and event-responsive rather than static,\" he added. \"In this particular campaign, the threat actor moved fast immediately after Maduro was captured.\"\n\nMustang Panda, as with its previous phishing expeditions, aligned its cyber operation with current geopolitical events. In this case, it was Maduro's capture, while earlier campaigns used lures tied to diplomatic conferences and region-specific political events.\n\n\"Operationally, Mustang Panda favors medium-complexity, repeatable execution techniques, most notably the extensive use of DLL sideloading to deploy custom implants via benign or trusted executables,\" the threat research unit wrote.\n\nAdditional analysis of the zip archive revealed an executable launcher named \"Maduro to be taken to New York\" - this turned out to be a renamed launcher binary for a music streaming service owned by Tencent - plus a hidden, malicious DLL called kugou.\n\nKugou.dll, according to the researchers, turned out to be a never-before-seen backdoor that they named Lotuslite. The custom C++ implant communicates with a hard-coded, IP-based command-and-control server. It establishes persistence on infected machines, performs beaconing tasks and allows operators to steal data from victims' environments.\"",

In reality, it shields their partners: insurers, hospital systems, device makers, etc from the threat of cost-effective class-action recruitment.\n\nFinding patients for these lawsuits is historically difficult and expensive. By cutting off this path, Epic provides no tangible benefit to patients, but massive upside to the entrenched healthcare industry. They created the closed system, gave out API access, and are now playing arbiter to suit their business interests.\n\nLet me get really specific: if a surgeon left a sponge in you, and your hospital used a partner to proactively find and right that wrong, Epic would now position itself as the barrier stopping that help: protecting the system, and not the patient.\n\nThis is bad for patient outcomes.",

Epic is now inserting itself between that doctor-patient relationship. This cripples a clinic's ability to proactively find and remedy harms like surgical errors or faulty devices which forces patients back into the exhausting, reactive queue of denials and appeals. \n\nThat's exactly what insurers and device manufacturers need: to reduce the volume of successful claims or class-action participants.\n\nEpic cannot, in good faith, claim to protect patient data by banning API partners who advocate for patients, while simultaneously selling de-identified clinical data to pharmaceutical giants through Cosmos for trial recruitment. One side makes their ecosystem partners money; the other side threatens it.\n\nSo no, they aren't illegally limiting interoperability. They are legally weaponizing it. They've built a system where data can flow, but only toward uses that serve their commercial network. It's not about blocking the flow of data completely; I believe it's about stifling its functional utility for anything that challenges their partners' bottom line.",

That is 100% malicious.\n\nTo answer your specific questions: yes, the ~800MB size is actually a massive IOC in itself.\n\nWhat you're seeing is called \"Binary Padding\" or \"File Pumping.\" Malware authors intentionally stuff the binary with hundreds of megabytes of junk data (usually just zeroes) to inflate the file size. They do this because almost all AV/EDR solutions (including Sophos) have a file-size limit for scanning to prevent CPU bottlenecks. If a file is over 500MB, the scanner often just skips it. That’s likely how it got past the initial defense.\n\nregarding the lock/hashing issue:\n\nThe interactions with hmpalert.dll (HitmanPro Alert, which is part of Sophos) suggest Sophos knows it's suspicious but is stuck in a weird state.\n\n• The EDR likely hooked the file or holds a kernel-level handle on it (which is why you can't calculate the hash or check ownership—it's locked by a driver).\n\n• It's basically a standoff: Sophos has it pinned but might be failing to quarantine it because of that massive file size.\n\nHow to unblock yourself:\nSince the OS won't let you touch the file to get a hash:\n\n1. The \"Easy\" Way: Boot into Safe Mode (Networking Disabled). This usually stops the malware and unloads the Sophos drivers locking the file. You should be able to hash or copy it then.\n\n2. The \"Live\" Way: Use a tool that leverages Volume Shadow Copies (like Hobocopy or RawCopy). This lets you copy the file from the shadow volume, bypassing the file lock entirely.\n\nOnce you get that hash, I guarantee it’s going to be a known baddie (or a heavily padded variant of one). Good catch on the \"svhost\" typo!",

The same goes for pen tester, malware engineer, incident responder, and digital forensics engineer.  IT and cybersecurity are incredibly wide fields, and certifications help distinguish a person's experience and skill set in slices of those huge spaces.  Even to the point of this vendor or that one.  An administrator may be responsible for a system that serves thousands of users, and the product has hundreds of developers that have been developing it for 10 years.  It is a huge thing, and something one could build a career around.  A lot of people would have the experience, knowledge, and aptitude to learn to manage it, but someone with a certificate from that vendor, or in that specific role, has evidence that they HAVE learned it, and can be productive very quickly in the role.",

          "text": "I’m not saying certifications are useless. They aren’t. But early in a career, they are often oversold, especially when compared to the long-term value of a solid four-year degree.\n\nI’m a director and manager of a small but highly capable DFIR cyber team that operates as part of a larger cyber organization. I’m directly involved in hiring, mentoring, and developing analysts. What I’m seeing today is very different from what the market looked like even three to five years ago.\n\nThere was a gold rush in cybersecurity. Organizations needed people quickly, and they needed them “good enough” to staff SOCs and respond to alerts. Bootcamps and entry-level certifications filled a real need at the time. They helped people get up to speed on basic tooling and workflows, and for a while that was enough to get hired.\n\nThat phase is over.\n\nThe market has matured. Much of the truly entry-level work has either been offshored, automated, or absorbed by better tooling, better processes, and more efficient teams. What remains are higher-expectation roles that require deeper understanding, better judgment, and the ability to adapt when things do not follow a playbook.\n\nDegrees matter again. Experience matters more. The bar is higher.\n\nWhat I still see, especially on Reddit and similar forums, is people clinging to the gold-rush mentality: get a few certs, land a SOC I role, and get catapulted into a cybersecurity career. That pathway is far less reliable today, and for many people it simply doesn’t work anymore.\n\nCertifications absolutely have a place, but they are not a replacement for a strong foundational education.\n\nA good four-year degree in computer science, computer information systems, or a well-designed cybersecurity program builds something certifications cannot: depth, context, and adaptability. When my team is hiring, I generally prefer candidates with CS or CIS degrees over narrowly focused cyber degrees. Those candidates consistently demonstrate broader technical understanding and stronger problem-solving skills.\n\nCS and CIS graduates tend to understand how systems actually work, not just how to operate tools. They are more comfortable with ambiguity. They reason better when something breaks in a way they haven’t seen before. They can pivot when a tool fails, logs don’t line up, or an incident doesn’t match a textbook scenario.\n\nThat matters in DFIR. It matters in mature cyber environments.\n\nI can teach the cybersecurity specifics, our workflows, our tools, our processes, relatively quickly if the person already has a solid technical foundation. I cannot easily teach systems thinking, troubleshooting intuition, or years of exposure to operating systems, networking, programming concepts, and data structures if those fundamentals were skipped.\n\nThis is where certifications fit best: continuing education.\n\nCerts are excellent for learning specific tools, platforms, or methodologies. They are valuable when someone already understands the underlying technology and has real-world experience to anchor that knowledge. Used that way, they are powerful. Used as a substitute for foundational education, they are fragile.\n\nHome labs, YouTube videos, and self-study are all useful, but they are not the same as being accountable in a real environment, working real incidents, under real constraints, with real consequences. A four-year degree, especially an in-person program done well, exposes students to that rigor over time and forces them to build habits that matter later in their careers.\n\nFaster is not always better.\n\nIf someone is early in their career and serious about cybersecurity as a long-term profession, not just landing their first job, the strongest path is still a solid four-year technical degree, followed by experience, and then certifications layered on top. That combination produces professionals who can grow, adapt, and remain relevant long after the latest tool or cert falls out of favor.\n\nThat’s what mature cyber teams are looking for now.",

I think another important aspect is that having the cert tells people that don't know you what you know.

Recruiters often see \"SOC\" on a resume and their brain just autopilots to \"ticket closer\" rather than \"engineer.\"\n\nThe reality is that to make the jump, you have to fundamentally change your narrative from \"I monitor the tools\" to \"I build the tools.\"\n\nIf you want to break out, here is the specific stuff you need to start doing so you can slap \"Security Engineer\" on your resume without feeling like an imposter:\n\n1. Stop clicking, start coding\nThis is the biggest filter. You don't need to be a full-stack dev, but you need to be comfortable with Python. If you find yourself doing a task in the SOC more than twice (like checking an IP against VirusTotal), write a script to do it for you. Put that script on GitHub. That is now \"Security Tooling Development,\" not just analysis.\n\n2. Learn how the sausage is made (Infrastructure)\nEngineers need to know how the servers and logs actually get built. Pick up Terraform or Ansible. Learn how to deploy a cloud instance (AWS or Azure) using code rather than the web console. If you can explain how the logs get to the SIEM, you’re already ahead of 90% of analysts.\n\n3. The \"Detection Engineering\" Bridge\nThis is the easiest pivot. Instead of just triaging the alert, start writing the logic that creates the alert. Look into Sigma rules. If you can tell an interviewer, \"I don't just work tickets, I write the custom detection logic using Sigma and deploy it via a CI/CD pipeline,\" you are hired.\n\nYou got this. Just start building.",

As for myself, I wouldn’t go back to that, especially having to contact end users and be contacted by end users on a daily basis brings back a lot of anxiety. \n\nSecurity engineer usually means you are building and maintaining security infrastructure. So having a system admin or network admin background is the typical route for this I would expect. \n\nAs a system admin, most places you work for has a hybrid infrastructure, so you would get a ton of experience with on-prem, firewalls, provisioning accounts, virtualization, and usually azure. \n\nYou will also have a ton of headaches because you are the main point of contact to put out fires and deal with users that break everything, and will blame their stupidity on you a lot of the times. As a security engineer, I’m guessing you probably won’t have to deal with end users as much. \n\nBut also be aware that security engineer could mean different things at different companies so make sure to look at the pre requisites in the job you want to work at the company you want to work for.",

Even the managers and their supervisors were coming in all at the same time, so politics/routines/preferences weren’t set in stone yet.\n\nThis is why I think that was important: while I have a *ton* of experience all across the board, I got hired *despite* these facts:\n\n    I hadn’t been getting paid at my prior job (I was basically just break even)\n    I’m pretty sure (based on more than one odd comment) I instantly failed a background check, because I owed student loans. \n    I had no certifications.\n    I needed relocation assistance\n    I was applying for an entry-level position with almost ridiculous proof that I have more experience (so…why?)\n    I omitted all programming/development experience on my resume.\n    Unusual education (and no bachelor’s)\n\nNone of that is mentioned to make you feel discouraged—like “wow, if I got hired with these problems…” …no: If I had applied to an established SOC I’m sure several of those would’ve gotten me hard-pass with prejudice, but they took a chance on me, and I literally got to see a major cost-is-no-object SOC get built from scratch.\n\nMy point is, and I really hope it’s a logical one—because there are many seasoned / career security folks here (I’m a career jack of all trades)—if you’re applying to established SOCs, perhaps you can get an angle on someone building a *new* one. I’m just one data point, but for the life of me “not yet established” is the best reason I can think of for why this risky proposition was hired.\n\n*(While there are probably some things that worked in my favor, they are probably typical and expected of anyone)*",

For this reason, I don't like that there's a stigma against people who didn't work in IT in the 90s or whatever. At some point, there's a cutoff to where you would have never had the opportunity to build AD forests, set up certification authentication servers, and all this other stuff. Some will say it's on you to learn it before applying for the job, but I say that's cap.

Are we talking about the type of AI that has existed for decades or the AI that is basically an advanced Google search that may or may not grow into something that is actually useful and can be used in a security context? I'm intentionally simplifying, but holy shit the amount of AI doom and gloom and/or \"life changing AI\" is driving me crazy when it's nowhere close to what people think it is currently. Learn about it, use it, but don't think it's something it isn't.\n\nI guess to directly answer your question instead of just ranting on AI bullshit, the most valuable positions/areas are those that directly mitigate or respond to risks that can financially impact a company - this would be GRC, DFIR, security operations/kind of threat hunting (and you can branch out to smaller fields from there, e.g. penetration testing, etc.). Considering you specifically named something super very specific such as Active Directory, I would look at what a shit ton of companies use, which does include Active Directory, but also includes things like Microsoft365 compliance/security (I feel like understanding Microsoft licensing is a degree program in of itself).",

You're going to find it even harder if it's an org that manages companies or institutes with strict security classificiations. The 'interviewers' are ruthless AF. Being muslim will make that much harder for you especially in these times.\n\nPersonally I've seen maybe one, born and raised here, working higher up at one of the big MSPs. But far and few between regardless.\n\nTry finding one of the jobs below at a big MSP and work your way up. Practically everyone I started with 1-2 decades ago climbed solely thru helpdesk etc at the MSPs.

A lot of it comes down to having prior experience because security isn’t entry level, and having a good resume. Also be presentable when you show up to interviews. Have a clean shave and a haircut and dress nice. It goes a long way. The way I look at it is if you can’t take care of yourself you can’t take care of the companies security.
