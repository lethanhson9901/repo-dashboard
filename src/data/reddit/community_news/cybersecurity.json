Assuming a normal distribution, that means you'll have 33,554,432 '1' or 'l'.\n\nYou then have to generate a new 'attempted file' for each 33,554,432 to cover each '1' or 'l'. That's a 2\\^n problem. 2\\^33554432 is....\n\n3.3x10\\^10,100,890\n\nYou have to run that many passes against the original 1GB - That's... a lot. Each pass is dirt cheap but the scaling's an issue. Simple problems to code and there's some clever things to improve the average time to hit (don't generate '1' and 'l' sequentially but randomly) but it's still a wild amount to crunch.\n\nOf course - that's assuming a multimedia, MASSIVE pdf. Assuming 1MB PDF, it's 1.4X10\\^9864. That's probably doable even on consumer hardware.\n\nWould be interesting for someone to benchmark it.\n\nAn LLM can make the code easily though:\n\n\"Generate python code to go through an array of characters, find all positions that are a '1' or an 'l', and then generate a an array of new arrays of characters, generating one new character array for each possible permutation of the original array where '1' and 'l' are replaced with either '1' or 'l'\n\nex. 'alcdl' + \\[1,4\\]\n\nOutput: alcdl, a1cdl, alcd1, a1cd1\"\n\nOf course that's the dumb version, you don't want to blow your memory up my storing all the intermediate attempt generations (you'd attempt a decode on the fly and break the loop if the API succeeded). And as mentioned you'd want to randomize the generation instead of keeping it linear. But, doable. Probably take an hour or two to hack together.",

I don’t expect that the network will produce an accurate classification of all l and 1’s but it does give us a place to start a search. Suppose that we use the network to spit out a list of only l/1’s with less than 60% classification certainty.

That doesn't excuse letting users know what is going on when you know more info. Considering that the software was vulnerable to hijacked updates since July, everyone needs more information to make sure there's not a dweller just sitting on their networks.\n\nResponsible disclosure is necessary - even for free and open-source software.

What to look out for:\n\n* gup.exe making network requests for other than: notepad-plus-plus.org, github.com and release-assets.githubusercontent.com.\n* gup.exe for unusual process subspawns — it should only spawn explorer.exe, and npp\\* themed Notepad++ installers. For 8.8.8 and 8.8.7 they should have valid digital signatures, and be signed by GlobalSign.\n* Files called update.exe or AutoUpdater.exe in user TEMP folder, where gup.exe has written and/or executed the files.\n* Use of curl.exe (bundled with Windows 10 and above) to call out to temp.sh for recon activity. [Example](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*c047T4mh0h5xOjl_ZiyL0A.png). You’ll notice AutoUpdater.exe — which isn’t a part of Notepad++, Notepad++ doesn’t use that filename at all — executing with the parameter /closeRunningNpp, which is called by the legit Notepad++ updater process — essentially, something else is in the update chain somehow in this example. The cause isn’t known in that case but it may be related to this blog.\n\nA more detailed report with [IOCs](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-chrysalis-backdoor-dive-into-lotus-blossoms-toolkit/#indicators-of-compromise-iocs-).",

Drip-feed patches across M365 channels, leave Semi-Annual and deferred tenants exposed for weeks, then act shocked when APTs weaponize the diff. Click-to-Run fragmentation is a feature, not a bug yet it keeps enterprises paying while attackers feast on version skew.. lol\nTechnically speaking, this is the same old Office mess: RCE chains + MotW/Protected View bypasses, HTML/RTF abuse, preview-pane shenanigans, and legacy COM/MSDT attack surface that should’ve been ripped out years ago. “Recently patched” just means red teams already reversed it and threat actors are farming orgs that aren’t on Current Channel because downtime = money. Defender signatures don’t save you when the execution path is signed, trusted, and user-assisted by design.\nAnd yeah, it hits harder knowing this cash-printing monopoly happily takes government contracts while bankrolling and politically enabling genocide, then turns around and lectures customers about “shared responsibility.” Spare us. You can’t virtue-signal security while shipping a productivity suite that’s still one malformed document away from domain compromise.\nPatch fast, disable Office macros for real, enforce ASR rules, block child process spawning, and assume every Office file is hostile. Microsoft won’t fix the incentives — only admins cleaning up their mess will.\nDammn feels like i talked so much but would a thing be changed real soon? Not particularly no..",

When an LLM suggests a package that doesn't exist, it creates a perfect opportunity for someone to register that name with malicious intent. Tracking these kinds of technical failures and market controversies is really the only way to stay defensive. Looking at analysis from Diary of a Dev, Dark Reading, or various security research labs can help you spot these patterns before they hit your own repositories.",

If you're breached, the damage is done within, at most, days. Swapping that password every 90 days to shut the door on them accomplishes essentially nothing, since permanency (if relevant) is far more likely to be accomplished by using my creds to install something that gives access, rather than repeated direct logins that an IPS might raise an eyebrow over.

      "text": "OpenClaw is already scary from a security perspective..... but watching the ecosystem around it get infected this fast is honestly insane.\n\nI recently interviewed **Paul McCarty** (maintainer of **OpenSourceMalware**) after he found **hundreds of malicious skills** on **ClawHub**.\n\nBut the thing that really made my stomach drop was **Jamieson O’Reilly** detailed post on how he gamed the system and built malware that became the number 1 downloaded skill on ClawHub -> [https://x.com/theonejvo/status/2015892980851474595](https://x.com/theonejvo/status/2015892980851474595) (Well worth the read)\n\nHe built a **backdoored (but harmless) skill**, then used bots to inflate the download count to **4,000+**, making it the **#1 most downloaded skill on ClawHub**… and real developers from **7 different countries** executed it thinking it was legit.\n\nThis matters because Peter Steinberger (the creator of OpenClaw) has basically taken the stance of:\n\n>use your brain and don't download malware \n\n(Peter has since deleted his responses to this, see screen shots here [https://opensourcemalware.com/blog/clawdbot-skills-ganked-your-crypto](https://opensourcemalware.com/blog/clawdbot-skills-ganked-your-crypto)\n\n…but Jamieson’s point is that **“use your brain” collapses instantly when the trust signals are fakeable.**\n\n# What Jamieson provedClawHub’s download counter could be manipulated with unauthenticated requests\n\n* There was **no rate limiting**\n* The server trusted **X-Forwarded-For**, meaning you can spoof IPs trivially\n* So an attacker can go:\n   1. publish malicious skill\n   2. bot downloads\n   3. become “#1 skill”\n   4. profit\n\nAnd the skill itself was extra nasty in a subtle way:\n\n* the ClawHub UI mostly shows **SKILL .md**\n* but the real payload lived in a referenced file (ex: `rules/logic.md`)\n* meaning users see “clean marketing,” while Claude sees “run these commands”\n\n# Why ClawHub is a supply chain disaster waiting to happen\n\n* **Skills aren’t libraries, they’re executable instructions**\n* **The agent already has permissions**, and the skill runs *inside that trust*\n* **Popularity is a lie** (downloads are a fakeable metric)\n* **Peter’s response is basically “don’t be dumb”**\n* **Most malware so far is low-effort** (“curl this auth tool” / ClickFix style)\n* Which means the serious actors haven’t even arrived yet\n\nIf ClawHub is already full of “dumb malware,” I’d bet anything there’s a room of APTs right now working out how to publish a “top skill” that quietly steals, credentials, crypto... all the things North Korean APTs are trying to steal.\n\nI sat down with paul to disucss his research, thoughts and ongoing fights with Peter about making the ecosystem some what secure.  [https://youtu.be/1NrCeMiEHJM](https://youtu.be/1NrCeMiEHJM)\n\nI understand that things are moving quickly but in the words of Paul \"You don't get to leave a loaded ghost gun in a playground and walk away form all responsibility of what comes next\"",

With a malicious npm package, the payload runs with whatever permissions the consuming application has, and in most deployments that’s scoped. With ClawHub skills, the payload runs inside an agent that likely already has filesystem access, shell execution, browser control, messaging credentials, and API keys. The skill doesn’t need to escalate privileges — it inherits them.\n\nAnd Peter’s “use your brain” response (deleted or not) reveals a fundamental architectural philosophy: security is the user’s responsibility, not the platform’s. That works when your users are security engineers. It doesn’t work when you have 149K GitHub stars and Codecademy is writing onboarding tutorials for beginners.\nWhat’s missing from OpenClaw — and what nobody in the ecosystem is really building yet — are the structural controls that make “use your brain” unnecessary:\n\n\t∙\tSkill allowlisting — nothing executes unless it’s on a vetted list, not a popularity-ranked marketplace\n\t∙\tStatic analysis gates — AST scanning for dangerous patterns (os.system, subprocess, eval, network calls) before a skill is ever eligible\n\t∙\tPer-agent budget ceilings — so even a compromised skill can’t run up unlimited API costs\n\t∙\tCryptographic signing — so you can verify a skill hasn’t been tampered with between publish and install\n\t∙\tAudit trails with layer enforcement traces — so you can forensically reconstruct what a skill actually did vs. what it claimed to do\n\nI’ve been building these as an open-source framework at SammaSuit.com — eight enforced security layers specifically designed around the gaps OpenClaw leaves open. The allowlist-based skill gating (what we call SANGHA) is the direct answer to the ClawHub trust problem: instead of “download what’s popular and hope it’s not malware,” it’s “nothing runs unless you’ve explicitly approved it.” Not a marketplace — a gate.\n\nJamieson and Paul are doing critical work surfacing these issues. The uncomfortable next step is building the infrastructure that makes the exploitation paths they’ve documented structurally impossible rather than just documented.",

      "text": "Hey guys - One thing that seems to fly under the radar with the current NPP discussion. A lot of you are saying that that this is „old news“ - but from my understanding the big difference to the December reporting is that it was no attack via DNS/ISP with enormous manual effort but rather the NPP hosting infrastructure compromised for quite a long time.\n\nAre people still assuming that the victims were selectively targeted? I find it quite likely that a second wave could’ve been much broader.\n\nI see the rapid7 report mentioned often but even they are writing in their first few paragraphs that they were not able to determine the initial scope of infrastructure compromise. And the incident report from the NPP developer is vague at best.\n\nWhat are your actual strategies right now? With the info at hand we are looking at a full reinstall of clients using notepad++.\n\nEDIT: Does someone know the old hosting provider used by notepad++? We have a lot of update routines identified via our xdr and knowing what „legitimate“ would be really helpful.",

We've been talking about dependency chain attacks but this is the supply chain for developer tools themselves.\n\nHow many orgs audit the update mechanisms for the software their devs use daily? Notepad++ is installed on basically every Windows machine that touches code. If you can't trust the update server you can't trust any code written on that machine.\n\nThis is why reproducible builds and signed binaries matter but also why we need better tooling to verify tool integrity post-install. Most shops have no idea if their dev tools have been tampered with.",

In one of the campaigns, the actors caused the victim to download a malicious `.exe` file, which turned out to be an NSIS installer of approximately 1 MB named “Chrysalis.” Upon execution, the actor uses `cmd` and `curl` to send system information to the attackers. Chrysalis is a backdoor that executes several files in `%appdata%\\ProShow`; one of these corresponds to legitimate ProShow software, which is used to run the final payload.\n\nThe payload contains two shellcodes. One of them includes junk code; however, the second retrieves Metasploit, which then downloads a Cobalt Strike beacon designed to establish a connection with the threat actor’s Command and Control (C&C) server.\n\nIn another campaign, the attackers added several commands to gather information from the victim’s machine, such as `whoami`, `tasklist`, `systeminfo`, and `netstat`. In general, the campaigns show slight variations, such as the URL used to download the Chrysalis backdoor, its size, and the paths where executables are stored. However, their objective remains the same: to obtain Metasploit and download the Cobalt Strike beacon.",

It's ok to feel a bit rough about that. Humans are allowed to have their feelings. But once you have given yourself a little time, pick yourself up, brush yourself off, and get back out there. \n\nRemember the guys we're defending against have bad days too. In fact, every time I have a good day, it means they're having a bad one. And yet, they keep coming back. We can too.",

Mine was blanking on basic SIEM correlation concepts during a senior engineer interview - stuff I literally did every day. Nerves are real.\n\nTwo things worth considering:\n\n1. The fact that you are discouraged means you actually care, which puts you ahead of a lot of people who coast. That feeling sucks right now but it is fuel if you channel it right.\n\n2. Coding assessments in security interviews are a weird filter. Most security engineers I have worked with are not developers - they are problem solvers who can script when needed. If this role requires heavy development, it might not be the right fit, and that is okay. If they are just using it as a general filter, that is a sign the hiring process is broken, not that you are broken.\n\nPractical suggestion: take note of every question you stumbled on and spend the next two weeks filling those specific gaps. Not generic \"study more\" but targeted practice on exactly where you fell short. That turns a bad interview into a free assessment of what to work on next.\n\nFour years in this field is solid. Do not let one bad hour undo that.",

Trust me, it works:\n\nhttps://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique\n\n2. You’ll need to manage your RSD: every comment can be taken as a personal attack if you’re not careful. People are not complaining to you about you. They ‘re usually expressing frustration with the event. \n\n3. If you are not going to write it down in the moment, take a picture with your phone. Use that for when you get around to the documentation in the year 2099 or later this week when your boss asks about it. \n\n4. Give yourself time away from computers. You will need to have some sort of delineation between your work and your personal life. If you don’t do this, you’ll wake up in 25 years and realize that your personal and business life has merged into a single entity, never allowing you respite (not that I’m talking from personal experience here /s)\n\n5. ADHD skills that are highly useful: situational awareness, pattern recognition, squirrel. \n\n6. Your medical conditions are not Office news. Tell your direct report and infer with your team… chances are you’re on a Neuro spicy team to begin with so all is good. \n\n7. No matter how easy, never lie. Never misinform. This doesn’t mean you need to make your boss’s office a confession booth (sometimes STFU is the right move).\n\n8. . Don’t beat yourself up too much.

In any job they will often be annoyed when you want something. If you do anything around incidents stress is high, sometimes also other emotions\n\n- Time restrictions; time blindness can be problematic in the sense that timeframes for reactions or communications can be short/exist even when diving in, it can also get problematic because a lot of task run longer and still can't be forgotten or need checking in. The first is more typical in anything with incidents, the latter more with engineering or policies \n\n- Completion / following through: connects to task switching, but there often are lose ends to tie which are not NECESSARILY required anymore. (Which is why I personally like playbooks or templates with steps)\n\n- Task organisation: There is a lot of smaller things to do, things that need to be done regularly but not often, and tasks broken between different systems - keeping track can be hard\n\n- Memory is often relevant: working memory can be crucial when doing incidents, knowing where everything is written is relevant, knowing policies can be important, and often meetings will not have protocols but need to be taken in.\n\n- Planning and prioritisation are often central parts of tasks - more relevant the more one goes IR / direct reaction (I think) \n\n- Appointments - the more you mesh with other departments, the more often this will be relevant\n\n- Demanding work environment - a lot of work in Cybersecurity has a lot of demands or stress. As self-assessment can be hard with ADHD, risk of burnout or accepting bad environments for too long are very real. The work also often does not naturally allow break at clever times, but god damn especially ADHD needs them \n\n- Documentation requirements: documentation is way more boring then IR (or even architecture etc). It's very required. That can be hard.\n\n- Overload: adjacent to task organisation - often enough one has a lot of, sometimes really different, tasks in cybersecurity. Even if you know them all, it can be overwhelming to see them and lead to not starting any\n\n- Content planning / creation: god it can be so freaking hard to get your non-linear thinking to words which work for linear thinking colleagues (be it your team or people in other departments)\n\n- Noise: the exact kind of noise depends highly on your work place, but there are so many chances for it: alerts, too many tools, so so many mails, noisy office spaces due to e.g. others in meetings, visual noise with tooling. It's good to know what you can and cannot tolerate\n\n- having to step back: continuous necessity in so many jobs in Cybersecurity - but at the same time usually requires when nearly in the middle of the deep dive. That's hard.\n\n- Sometimes it can feel like \"it\" never ends: many cybersecurity jobs are continuous - and require parallel work on more than one thing. So even when you finish something, it can be hard to actually feel the accomplishment\n\n- Clearing up a setup, technical debt etc needs to happen \"in between\". Similar to tidying up at home - similarly potentially difficult",

          "text": "Yep, it's fantastic.\n\nHonestly, executive disfunction is rarely a problem because I've got so much to hold my attention.  Not only that but I often see things other people don't and I can keep multiple trains of thought going at the same time, so long as they're related to the thing I'm currently working on, it's like my brain is automatically tracing the path through 50 different mazes at the same time when I'm trying to solve a problem.\n\nHowever, if you don't have strong leadership with clear direction, it can be extremely easy to fall into task paralysis.   If there's a clear problem that needs solving, i.e an incident, or a complex problem, I can literally spend my whole shift glued to my screen, completing work that takes most other people days to work through.\n\nI think the most critical thing that has made my work life infinitely easier is a simple notepad and pen.   I've got the left page intentionally blank for random notes, shit I need to jot down so I don't forget but has no direct relation to clearly defined tasks, followups I need to do that have ambiguous actions required etc, then the right page is always ruled, dated, and has the SPECIFIC tasks I need to complete for that day, along with any notes from meetings or instructions/guidance given.   That way I'm always able to refer back to a specific day and know exactly what happened and the context in which it was in, and at the end of each week, I flick through the last few pages over notes which cements it all in my long term memory.\n\nI strongly advise against using note taking APPs, because it's digital it's very easy as someone with ADHD to just forget it's there, a physical notepad doesn't have that problem, it's always in eyesight, and you have to physically manipulate it to do anything with it (which helps build more neural connections to solidify the memory).  But one type of app I will recommend that many companies use anyway, is some form of task board like [monday.com](http://monday.com) or Jira.  The main advantage of this is being able to copy paste important information, conversations, screenshots, URLs, hyperlink relevant documents, and share that information easily with others.",

          "text": "\"Cybersecurity experts usually advise victims against paying ransomware crooks, but that advice goes double for those who have been targeted by the Nitrogen group. There's no way to get your data back from them!\n\nAccording to Coveware, which peered under the hood of Nitrogen's ransomware program, a programming error prevents the gang's decryptor from recovering victims' files, so paying up is futile.\n\nThe finding specifically concerns the group's malware that targets VMware ESXi. Coveware said that the program encrypts files with the wrong public key, making it impossible for the criminals to decrypt them, even if the victim pays for a decryption tool.\n\nNitrogen's malware makes the error of loading a new variable, a QWORD, into memory so that it overlaps with the public key.\n\nBecause the malware loads the public key at offset rsp+0x20 and the 8-byte QWORD at rsp+0x1c, it overwrites the first four bytes of the public key, meaning that an attacker-supplied decryptor would fail.\n\n\"Normally, when a public-private Curve25519 keypair is generated, the private key is generated first, and then the public key is derived subsequently based on the private key,\" Coveware said.\n\n\"The resulting corrupted public key wasn't generated based on a private key, it was generated by mistakenly overwriting a few bytes of another public key. The final outcome is that no one actually knows the private key that goes with the corrupted public key.\"\n\nNitrogen has been around since 2023. According to Coveware, it began as one of the various offshoots that borrowed code from the leaked Conti 2 builder.\n\nBarracuda Networks previously reported that it evolved into a ransomware group slowly over time. It first developed malware to facilitate initial access for others, although its operators didn't work as initial access brokers, but began extorting organizations in or around September 2024.\n\nWhile it is not one of the most prolific groups in operation, it is also not to be underestimated.\n\nEven with this latest finding, which will go down alongside other epic own goals by ransomware gangs, it's hard to see the funny side with this one.\n\nThe coding error takes this financially-motivated ransomware gang into the realm of pure destruction, where both parties walk away losers.\"",
