It's a full-stack replacement—these systems are designed to run on domestic hardware, such as Kirin and Zhaoxin CPUs.\n\nOutside of China, these systems are virtually non-existent. They still can't quite match the raw performance Wintel.The primary advantage is that the entire stack is under domestic control.

Also, doesn't sound like there's going to be any formal seating, so have fun holding your laptop up while you're standing in a crowd. \n\nMy real answer: they probably don't want any amateurs being disruptive with electronic devices there that they can't track down. Normal cell phones can be tracked and identified. They could never stop an actual attacker with proper covert gear, but they can stop a bunch of children from DoS'ing equipment and being annoying.",

The political atmosphere around this election was charged to say the least, and it stands to reason that Mamdani’s inauguration could be a more interesting target for disruption than others.

After doing that, I don’t see how this is being framed as “crippling” U.S. cyber defense.\n\nOur cyber defenses have never come from the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise or the Global Counterterrorism Forum. Those are policy and capacity-building forums, not operational defense bodies. They don’t provide sensors, threat intelligence feeds, incident response, or active defense. They don’t hunt adversaries, attribute attacks, or stop intrusions.\n\nU.S. cyber defense is rooted in NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, CISA, the FBI Cyber Division, Five Eyes intelligence sharing, bilateral agreements with allies, and massive private-sector telemetry from companies like Microsoft, CrowdStrike, and Mandiant. None of that goes away because we leave a multilateral policy forum.\n\nThere’s a fair debate to be had about diplomacy and influence, but saying this “opens us up to cyberattack” or that it proves someone is a foreign asset is a stretch that doesn’t match how cyber defense actually works. If leaving these forums truly crippled us, we’d have to believe they were quietly doing the core work of U.S. cyber defense — and they simply weren’t.\n\nDisagree with the policy if you want, but let’s keep the criticism grounded in reality instead of treating non-operational forums like they were the backbone of national cyber security",

It is questionable to claim it validated a continental system collapse.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. has been using similar electrical system blackouts in similar situations since at least the Korean War. Forcing air defense and other adversary forces to switch off the main grid has numerous advantages to the attacker. I don’t have any evidence that anything nuclear nor exotic was used in Caracas.

It's often easier to simply walk into substations and destroy some capacitors.\n\nI've traditionally interpreted claims like this more as a PR stunt to sow FUD. It is theoretically possible, but low probability and likely not the most effective tool at your disposal if you're actually seeking to cause a blackout. What if the cyber attack had failed? Why not use the military to walk in and trigger the isolators, or blow it up? Kinetic options were definitely on the table here!",

If you listen to the speech, that was the context anyways.\n\nThere’s also the strategic angle here, the Admin wants the country to function better after this regime change, to curry favor, and support whoever they put in charge of the country. In other words, I don’t think they wanted to completely cripple the economy.",

This is not true and framing like it is shows both a lack of understanding and devalues the legitimate concerns by association.\n\n* 899 people is a shutdown posture, there is no evidence to show that this is a permanent headcount.\n* The Cyber Safety Review board was disbanded, that's a transparency/learning-loss problem not the removal of day to day defensive operations.\n* the Cyber Info Sharing Act's protections lapsed in October of 2025, and were extended only temporarily to the end of this month. While from the outside that could chill voluntary sharing at the margins, it doesn't \"sever\" all government - industry coordination. In fact most transpires outside of these working groups. If you don't believe me, ask anyone that attended the Industry TTX (Chain Breaker) exercise how that went and what the situations were before and after.\n* Some states have claims that election security support they rely on has been cut, but that doesn't equate to \"No cyber defenses\" also it's largely the responsibility for each state to ensure cyber resiliency through many different means (including NSA / FBI relationships).\n\nNow the better approach would have been to preface it like this \"How do recent changes affect the warning to action cycle?\" There's a lot of organizations including ISACs that largely just push the same data around in circles and aren't very effective.\n\nThe private sector will continue to lead the charge. Key players like Microsoft, Amazon, Cloudflare, Crowdstrike, etc will continue to leverage their relationships within the government to enable a better security posture for the US and for the Globe.\n\nI will also add that there are still great people at CISA working just as hard as the have in the past, focused on enabling these relationships as well. We're not screwed in any way shape or form, we're just optimizing. \n\n\\-----\n\nHere's a great response from Chat GPT on all of this, I would concur.\n\n\"NSA, FBI, and CISA are still largely effective at what they do within their respective lanes: NSA and the Intelligence Community continue to generate foreign-intelligence-driven insight and technical guidance; FBI remains the lead for investigations, disruption, and prosecution; and CISA still sets civilian defensive priorities (e.g., KEV-driven patch urgency) and coordinates incident response and sector engagement—even if reduced resourcing can slow throughput and outreach. But it’s also important to be clear-eyed about where “cyber defense” actually happens day to day: the largest portion of prevention, detection, and recovery is executed by private-sector owners and operators and their security vendors (SOCs, MSSPs, EDR providers, cloud platforms, ISACs, insurers, and incident response firms). Federal agencies can sharpen prioritization, share intelligence, and help coordinate response, but they don’t run most enterprise networks—and they never have—so the nation’s baseline cyber resilience is fundamentally driven by private-sector posture and operational discipline, with the government acting as an enabling and backstopping layer rather than the primary security provider.\"",

You can't have two smart people working on an issue without a manager.  And those two people will probably need a project manager to keep them on target because the manager needs to meet with other managers.  And then you need an admin to facilitate emails between the manager, the PM, the techs, and anyone else.  And then you need an IT person to keep those systems everyone is using alive.  All this happens, and even though there are staff assigned to another group that are doing something similar, because they don't work for your group you can't/won't use them, even if they have plenty of cycles available to do what needs to be done, because they don't report to the one manager and therefore there is no accountability.\n\nThis also happens in large corporations and is why the occasional RIF is required.  I worked at a company where 5 people were dedicated, full time, to making sure that 5 cables were lit.  I've seen where 6 people were staffed 24/7/5 to send stats..and I wrote a quick program that did all of it within 30 minutes and was told to shelve my program and shut up about it.",

      "text": "I've spent the last decade in incident response, working across everything from 5-person joinery shops to multi-national retail enterprises. After cleaning up roughly 1,000 incidents, I naturally developed a bit of an intuition for knowing the difference between \"good security\" and \"good control coverage\".\n\nThe firms that survive incidents (and prevent them) are almost never the ones with the most tools or the biggest budgets. They were the ones who understood their resilience - where they'd actually break under pressure, and what that would cost them.\n\nA few things I've learned that changed how I approach assessments:\n\n**1. Compliance framing creates false confidence**\n\nCyber Essentials, SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc - you must understand that their sole purpose is to make it easier to do business with other companies. Executives sponsor these programmes because it will make them more money.\n\nThat might be by making their onboarding quicker, or shortening deal cycles when responding to RFPs, or just increasing consumer confidence.\n\nNone of it actually helps an organisation be more secure. At the best, I think it's fair to say that there's a small correlation between certifications and resilience, but it's absolutely not a casual relationship, just a pattern.\n\n**2. Clients respond to money, not maturity scores**\n\nNobody outside of security knows what \"Level 3 maturity\" means. But say \"you have a high insolvency risk from a major incident\" and suddenly you've got board-level attention. I frame all my assessments this way, even for small businesses.\n\nThe key principle to consider is that security programmes cost money. And for any commercial venture, money MUST provide a return on investment. If your recommendations don't make your client more money then they cost, why would they do it? I've known many enterprises that simply accept that they will have a major incident every 1-2 years, because the cost of transforming their security architecture would cost more than the impact of the incidents.\n\nThis is a totally valid position! And if you can help your client weigh up exactly what the pros and cons are, then you will quickly become one of their most trusted and valuable partners.\n\nThe trick, of course, is having the data and vocabulary to model the commercial implications.\n\n**3. The \"time to low risk\" metric changes the conversation**\n\nExecutive audiences don't understand CVSS scores, and are not going to read your 47 technical findings. Include them for context and for technical readers, but stick them in an appendix, and instead, lead with the programme required to get from their current state into an acceptable state.\n\nHow many months will it take? How much will it cost? Who will do the work? How do they measure success?\n\nThis completely changes the conversation, and transforms a scary report into an actionable project plan that your client will have confidence in sponsoring. You want your client to feel like they've been handed a solution, not a problem.\n\n**4. Periphery systems are where organisations actually die**\n\nCore infrastructure is usually fine - everyone's got M365, EDR, and MFA on their main systems now. If they've put one iota of effort into changing the defaults or have an MSP that does this for them, by and large they are in a great position.\n\nThe reason organisations like this still get hacked is because of the exceptions. Machines that don't have DfE on. Servers that have been missed from your asset register. An SSL VPN that no-one knew about.\n\nFixing these are often quick wins. Migrating might be a pain, but it's ultimately a short programme of work with a high reduction in risk.\n\n\\----\n\nI've put together a sample report that captures everything I've discussed above with a fictitious client. Here's the link: [https://analystengine.io/msp-assessment-sample](https://analystengine.io/msp-assessment-sample)\n\n**Transparent disclosure:** The site above does link to my cybersecurity startup focused on generating content like the above. That being said, the link above contains no CTA or sales material. I'm making the sample freely available as a resource for others to use how they see fit - and have added the required corporate flair to this post.\n\nI would love any advice or feedback on the report structure if anyone has thoughts on how to improve it!\n\n\\----\n\nEDIT: Overwhelmed with all the support this post got! For those asking for follow-up materials and my playbook for delivering cybersecurity assessments, I've typed it all up here: [How to deliver cybersecurity assessments](https://www.analystengine.io/how-to-deliver-cybersecurity-assessments?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=cybersecurity)\n\nI've included lots of resources, including the sample questionnaire I use for all new engagements, and a checklist of items to go through during your technical interviews.

Some enterprises really want to be more secure, in which case GRC efforts provide a roadmap and a yardstick for measuring progress. What most enterprises wish for, however, is a checkmark as a sales qualification, so they can sell into specific markets where security is a concern. For example, I can't tell you how many companies might say, \"We'll buy from you, but you need your SOC 2\" for enterprises where a SOC 2 isn't even appropriate, or they don't understand the difference between a SOC 2 Type I and II. Still, they will take a well-documented list of security controls over adequate security.",

But the assessment sample is hard to follow and I have a hard time wondering when, why, and how I'd actually put it to use. If it is for SMB, then stuff like software developent will most likely not be an item. I like the control assessment, compliance (if it applies), and findings section. But idk.. on the whole it seems very long and too wordy. In my experience SMB dont have the attention span for most of this stuff. Great as a deliverable if your trying to demonstrate value with a very long document, but how useful is it is what I always ask myself. How does any of this translate to the client to take action on? Feel free to disagree, but thats just my initial take.",

I agree on the SDLC front, but I included it in the sample because if a company does do it they always request it and I wanted to evidence that we do capture this. If you read the business context section of the executive summary, there is reference to the fact that ACME develops a small internal portal. But I agree that this will apply to very few SMBs.\n\nIf you take just the Overview sections (exec summary, compliance status, recommendations), would you find that more condensed? The only people I would expect to read further than that are technical people who need to action specific findings.",

Most of the time the SMB is just the owner that doesnt really know what to do, so they hire the MSP to do this stuff. So, if the context is that you are the MSP doing a security evaluation, then a lot of this seems kinda unnecessary. Like, you are reporting to the owner on your own security work, etc. - and that could be drastically summarized in my opinion.   \nOtherwise, I'd ask who is this meant for? An IT manager, the owner? or the MSP if you are just the external security evaluator/auditor?    \nWhat is the high level overview of the findings, and some details on each category evaluated - then maybe some technical stuff to help guide whoever might actually implement changes/fixes. The rest seems like fluff that I wouldn't expect anyone to read and seems to bog down the report.",

I can tell you what services you provide and how they compare to what your competitors are doing. But risk is not addressed by NIST CSF.\n\nClient: So what have I paid for then?!\n\nThe security domains I've included in this sample (SecOps, Resilience, Growth) are all aligned/mapped to NIST in the backend. But especially for the SMB audience where the buyer is a little less mature, I think it's important we can go beyond service maturity and actually present improvement roadmaps aligned to risk - because really that's what they care about.\n\nPeople may disagree on that, and that's fair.

If it doesn't do that, this is how you get your budgets slashed and see a service regression.\n\nEven in organisations that have board-level CISO representation, your CEO and CFO are still critical stakeholders. And if you tell them that 2-3 incidents a year costs the company $5 and an investment of $10 would reduce that annual cost to $2... there's a strong argument for them to say \"Let's wait a few years\".  \n  \nAll I am really saying is you will get more achieved and further your agenda better if you work within this way of thinking. CEOs and CFOs hate it when security feels like it's a sunken cost.",

I frame all my assessments this way, even for small businesses.\n\n> The trick, of course, is having the data and vocabulary to model the commercial implications.\n\nYes, of course, dollar figures can raise urgency; but you talk about “modelling” risk in financial terms. Anyone who’s been through this exercise knows it’s an exercise in choosing which variables to multiply together. Very Often, in practice, best case is $0 and worst case is the sky has fallen. \n\nDay to day does this boil down to maturing finding severity ratings + canned copy in the report? \n\nIn my experience this requires more restraint be exercised than vocabulary. Very easy to scaremonger and kick up urgency. Not so easy to scale (aka show true granular relative risk and help the business to prioritise over time). \n\nLong story short: Talking “insolvency” or business outcomes with execs who (should) know 100x more than you about the business is a minefield, don’t you think? \n\n**secondly: on providing rich, end to end remediation plans to the business** \n\nThe “time to low risk” metric as you call it. Another no brainer: yes execs would love this - but how do you do it at scale? \n\nAs you describe incidents are rarely simple and can have many compound causes. \n\nYou have, say, 30 findings. Just to make up an example, they’re across: Appsec issues flagged by sast (plus some old ancillary risk for good measure), container rehydration issues with several modules, EOL components in use, legacy internally developed library dependencies flagged by sca, architecture review shows some red flags, auth is not blueprint standard but risk is unclear, an api not discovered by inventory, and to top it off external risk rating agencies are starting to ding you. (Now, your post talks about IR, but your template talks about general risk posture assessment. If it’s the latter I’ve kept things very very simple in this example). \n\nYou ask all the questions, like it’s a lack of business consideration that causes security to not hand this information over: \n\n> How many months will it take? How much will it cost? Who will do the work? How do they measure success?\n\nBut how do you, as cyber, answer them systematically before even issuing a report? Is that even possible for nontrivial orgs you are not embedded in (I mean, I’m sure there’s some people much smarter than me who could infer a tonne and get pretty far - but I assume this template is for the average responder?) \n\nAre just just giving generic canned solutions/plans to symptoms of generic problems? In which case the “actionable plan” sales pitch is a bit overhyped. \n\nAt scale: Answering these questions - actually answering them - is more work than responding to the incident in the first place. Much more work. Often it is also work that security absolutely cannot do in isolation - so you find yourself needing buy in from business long before you can give them these answers with any confidence at all. \n\nObviously an end to end project plan would be easier to action but if it was as simple as just doing that, it would be the default already.\n\n> You want your client to feel like they’ve been handed a solution, not a problem.\n\nYes obviously but the reason IR doesn’t hand the business fully fledged solutions on a silver platter are, in short, doing so scales very slowly and comes with many built in challenges.",

When we're dealing with security assessments, we only have several finite tools with which to deal with assessments of any kind.\n\n\\- We can look at control effectiveness  \n\\- We can look at service maturity  \n\\- We can look at governance  \n\\- We can look at risk\n\nEach of these domains is highly specalised, and with mature buyers like enterprises, they will almost always be very separate engagements with different stakeholders.\n\nBut for smaller organisations, it's impractical. So instead you have to squish multiple concepts together - because ultimately, what we want to do is best advise the organisation and ensure their business has strong margins (not weighed down by unnecessary cybersecurity cost centres) and can remain functional even if a disaster happened with their technology. That's the quintessence of our job.\n\nI accept basically all your points, I guess my only response is that we still have to do SOMETHING, and this is probably one of the best things you can do with the budget, resourcing, and buyer requirements that we most often have,",

SSL VPNs have seen some of the most 0day vulnerabilities on record, and these issues simply have not affected IPSEC implementations. \n\nHowever - in all the cases I’m aware of, adding MFA to the SSL VPN has been a mitigating measure. The vulnerabilities have only affected standard accounts with no second factor. This makes sense of course because your second factor will always involve a non-SSL identity component that’s much harder to spoof or break. \n\nThis means that the cheapest and most effective thing a client can do is just add MFA. Removing the implementation completely is a huge project and highly disruptive to working practices that are already comfortable with the current process. \n\nIn principle, I agree that IPSEC is the more secure implementation out of the two. But it doesn’t mean it’s the best advice to give a client if they’re stuck with an alternative solution.",

          "text": "Hands-on experience as in, years of working in a related field such as Helpdesk, then SysAdmin/Networking? If not, that's where you should be starting. This is not entry-level work and someone with a degree and internship without industry experience is still entry-level in this world. It sucks because other fields are not like this, but the reality is labs cannot prepare you for real environments because they are wildly different and vary so much from employer to employer. Without seeing that first-hand, it's probably hard to picture because you put in all this effort and did come out with meaningful knowledge. Not taking any of that away, it's hard work to get to where you're at now and helpdesk or adjacent non-security work seems like a step in the wrong direction, but I assure you it's not. Some people are lucky enough to get SOC work to start out and if you can catch up and learn the context of those alerts without having the support experience, I'm all for it. I hired and trained some of these people for my own SOC company and some worked out really well, while others would likely benefit from a more solid foundation.\n\nI started my career at Geek Squad, so not even helpdesk. Then helpdesk for a few years. Then software dev for a few years where I also handled all my infra/devops/admin of said infra - part of that time for an anti-virus company. Then blue team for a few years also doing regular sysadmin work. Then pentesting for a few years. Then Director for a few years. Then CIO and co-founder/CIO for a few years. Currently an IC Security Administrator for a tech company.\n\nI cannot explain enough how important every aspect of my career has been in my current job. I am constantly expected to have deep knowledge of the systems that I am securing when working with other teams, and if I didn't, I'd be much less effective and likely lose political capital from other teams. That's not the case for every position in this field, but it's where I am today and it will be expected at more than you think, depending on what size companies you are expecting to work at. Larger ones will have more clearly defined roles, but for smaller and mid-sized companies, you will be expected to be a lot more flexible.\n\nToday's market sucks even for people at my level. With competition at your level being as fierce as it is, I could not imagine being in your position trying to start out. It's gotta be really tough and disheartening seeing comments like mine, which work more to solidify your assumptions that this is a very hard field to get into. Adding onto that, when you are looking for these adjacent roles, people are paying attention to your degree and experience and know full well that you aren't planning to stay unless there's a clear path to pivot to security internally, so that makes it even harder in many cases. Hiring someone is an investment and when people think you'll be gone inside of a year for a better opportunity, they're less likely to move forward. \n\nI wish I had some better advice or something more to add, but the bottom line is the market sucks right now and it's tough out there with so many people trying to get into the same field. Opening up a role that has decent pay and is remote gets a mind-boggling number of applications in a few short hours, and there are a lot of very solid candidates in that pile. It seems to me more and more, and I am basing this off of my own decision-making when it comes to hiring, you need some level of hands-on at a company to compete these days because you are competing against people who have what you do as well as that foundation in a lot of cases. Recent grads are in a very tough spot at the moment.\n\nOne piece of advice I will give to everyone looking to get into this field: network with others in the industry. Not on like LinkedIn, build actual relationships, make friends. There are a lot of great communities, I tend to like Discord for this more than anything these days, but Twitter and forums used to be where we did this before. If you have a recommendation from an internal employee, it's almost guaranteed that your resume will be at least looked at. The reality of that is if you can impress people after getting in the room with them for an interview, you may bypass some requirements that filter out other candidates. That's probably the best way to have mobility across the spectrum of experience right now, IMO. That said, it's no guarantee. I've had a few cases where I had recommendations and still wasn't what they were looking for, so it's not a silver bullet but it helps massively.",

The other side of the coin is that I think a lot of people wanting employment in security are in it because \"it's a good, in vogue, career with good pay\" (which is fine, depending on context) and way way way too many know basically nothing and haven't really put any real work into getting good at the thing they're looking to get paid baller money for.\n\nWhile my tone does seem critical, it's not directed at you, it's mostly playing devil's advocate. I have found a lot of difficulty finding good people. It's also very annoying when there are people in roles who are part-timers, or slack, when there are so many very hungry people that would near on kill for similar opportunities.\n\nI'd say if you really are into cybersecurity, just start doing stuff and getting a job will become easier. I'd offer advice on how to proceed, but you've not indicated where in Security you want to direct your attention. (If you say GRC, I'm out, though I'm afraid)",

Yes, there are Security roles in companies large and small and some companies have HUGE CS teams, but that might not be the case everywhere.\n\nThe Educational industry has successfully marketed and sold the “Cyber Security” degree, both bachelors and masters degrees and people spent big money on these degrees with the promise of $150k per year jobs lining up at graduation. This happens every enrollment season and no one ever asks “how many graduating students are you placing and what companies are hiring from this school?” In most cases, the answer will be zero. Zero companies are going to be waiting to hire a graduate of these programs. I see many candidates with basic and outdated CS degrees (yes, they are outdated) that may help build a foundation, but no real modern technologies included in that education. What we need to see are the people that understand IT, in large, medium and small business. They need to understand that business has to work before security, security personnel need to understand how to adapt security to make business work as well.\n\nYou need experience. Experience coding, experience in networking- building and maintaining these networks too, experience in support, project management, budgeting, security domains and standards. You need to understand the market today and the market 10 years ago to recognize the new and legacy technology.\n\nIt’s unfortunate that these degrees are being sold (for so much $$$$$ too) and there is no promise of success for making this investment.",

What we're seeing now, here in the US, looks a lot like what we see during recessions - you have people with years of experience going up against people with relatively little. People are either losing their jobs or they're anticipating losing them so there are a lot of deep resumes out there.",

I consistently question why and what I am doing wrong. I have consulted career advisors at school, had my resume professionally done, and still nothing. I even leveraged my experience managing accounts on various systems, such as Google Workspace and Azure Entra ID, along with my experience as an Okta admin, to try for IAM, which is where I want to be, and still nothing.

We have lost the internet, let’s be honest,” De Bruycker said. “If I want my information 100 per cent in the EU . . . keep on dreaming,” he added. “You’re setting an objective that is not realistic.”\n\nThe Belgian official warned that Europe’s [cyber defences](https://archive.ph/o/Z27fR/https://www.ft.com/cyber-security) depended on the co-operation of private companies, most of which are American. “In cyber space, everything is commercial. Everything is privately owned,” he said.\n\n\\[...\\]\n\nEurope needed to build its own capabilities to strengthen innovation and security, said De Bruycker, adding that legislation such as the EU’s AI Act, which regulates the development of the fast-developing technology, was “blocking” innovation.\n\nHe suggested that EU governments should support private initiatives to build scale in areas such as cloud computing or digital identification technologies.\n\nIt could be similar to when European countries jointly set up the planemaker Airbus, he said: “Everybody was supporting the Airbus initiatives decades ago. We need the same initiative on \\[an\\] EU level in the cyber domain.”",

Any real digital sovereignty seems impossible until we end these anti-circumvention laws.\n\nAcross the world, anti-circumvention laws could usually just be repealed at the national level, although some EU rules push them too, and must be repealed.\n\nEurope's only companies who profit from anti-circumvention laws should be treated as organized crime rings : Volkswagen and other car companies, who kill thouands via the diesel gate; Medtronic, whose vender lock-ins killed people by bricking ventilators during covid, Newag, whose vender lock-in makes repairing trains expensive and difficult.\n\n\\> *The Belgian official warned that Europe’s cyber defences depended on the co-operation of private companies, most of which are American.*\n\nYou cannot really buy \"cyber defence\" from any foreign company, not closed source tool anyways.  Instead, you need to take cyber defence seriously yourselfs, which firstly means making data unobtainable, either through encryption or through destruction.  \n\nEurope had a sane-ish first step under GDPR, but now they have started doing the opposite via [Chat Control](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/1nb2hnr/perceptual_hashing/) and [data retention](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1pkq6qy/eu_revives_plan_for_yearlong_data_retention/).   European nations even hires foreign companies for wiretapping like Palantir and Huawei, meanwhile the FBI now endorses end-to-end encryption like Signal because they discovered they'd never remove Chinese spies from [their CALEA mandated wiretapping infrastructure](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/calea-was-a-national-security-disaster-waiting-to-happen)\n\nIn fact, Europe's idiot leaders signed the [UN cybercrime convention](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Unlimited-Evidence-Gathering-EU-Ratifies-Controversial-UN-Cybercrime-Convention-10752328.html) which effectively promises to criminalize developing \"cyber defence\" (hint: It's written by Russia).",

Scraping isn't a breach, because that info is already public, there's no expectation of privacy from anyone. Probably counts as API use that is against the ToS, but that's not a breach event. \n\nBC even notes in the article that \"Instead, the information suggests the data may be a compilation of previously scraped information from multiple sources over several years.\"\n\nThe password reset issue was definitely an incident - and needs to be investigated (which it appears they're doing now).

Would you have preferred to do anything different?\n\n2) do you have a strategy for splitting your team's time on actual IR work, forensics, report writing and responding to clients who are demanding updates every few minutes?\n\n3) the stories I've heard from incident responders is that they get burnt out and develop mental health issues, after years of being on call and undergoing repeated intense periods of stress. How do you keep yourself and your team from burning out?\n\n4) when you first get thrown into the chaos of an attack investigation, what are your usual steps for getting a sense of what's happening?\n\n5) what are the unique observations during an investigation that made you go \"woah guys come and look at this finding!\"\n\n6) how do you deal with having to learn so much, in so little time across different investigations? Like, one day it would be DNS hijacking across the world, then a vendor's hardware that's compromised in a supply chain attack, then hundreds of devices infected with ransomeware, then a customer's kubernetes cluster is infected. It always amazes me how IR teams can do this.\n\n7) Do you have a strategy for your team on keeping track of previous investigations and revisiting that information during new incidents?\n\n8) I've personally experienced first hand, incident investigators being treated in a hostile and unhelpful manner from clients who engaged them. Do you have similar stories about these kinds of behaviours and tips on how to overcome this?\n\n9) any stories on investigations where you just went \"sigh, this really isn't worth my/my team's time\"?",

Most groups don't use sophisticated tactics, they are home-made but not sophisticated. Tradecraft is an art, and only a few groups took this seriously and had good operational procedures.",

As otherwise it couldn’t function. But that kind of thing tends to require serious consideration for RMM script execution, as they write the scripts onto disk ad-hoc (hopefully they handle signed scripts correctly).\n\nBut don't exclude RMM tools from on-access or behavioural scanning of your EDR, that'd be silly. Supply chain compromises can and do happen, and allow listing directories that the RMM resides within is a really good way to be compromised. If you allow-list the individual hashes of the program, that would be extra work every time there's an agent update, and also means RMM script execution likely would not be possible to exclude by hash or signature alone.\n\nAnd then from the attacker perspective, if I want somewhere to execute further code without anyone stopping me, I would enumerate all installed programs and look up their documented paths the vendor recommends be excluded from EDR. If whoever admins those systems has added those exclusions, surely one of those directories is a perfect place for a persistent backdoor.",

What’s stuck, and what didn’t?\n\nPS. I use all of these and it does my head in. I do, however, like the book [Hacking Cybersecurity Principles](https://mybook.to/hack_cyber_principles).",

It was inside for months undetected, pulling admin credentials, network maps, traffic flows… the stuff defenders dread. \n\nWhat’s weird to me is how often these 'state-sponsored' attacks aren’t about some sci-fi exploit no one’s ever seen. They’re about living off existing holes, stale configurations, and systems that are just way too hard to update or monitor well enough to notice someone walking around inside. \n\nThe headlines talk strategy and geopolitics, but the real problem feels like we still trust giant interconnected systems to stay invisible until the bad guys decide to leave. That rarely works out well.\n\nIs the cybersecurity community freaking out about 'nation state mastery' or are these breaches really just exposing how fragile our critical networks already are?",

Forget solutions that cost money, I have just enough budget to pay annual licensing fees and whatever annual increase I get is invariably eaten up by vendor price increases. \n\nAnd that's not even mentioning c-suite members that are concerned (for whatever base reason) with the learning curve of moving from network shares to cloud storage with DLP and App Protection Policies.

      "text": "I've tried submitting abuse reports through their web forms, but EVERY TIME they respond with a generic \"This report could not be validated, no action was taken.\" The do not seem to care about probing attacks, even when it is causing a DOS situation.\n\nSo I've set up a shell script that will collect all 404 errors on the server and total hits by IP address. The script then detects who controls the IP address, and if it's Microsoft, it emails a report to [abuse@microsoft.com](mailto:abuse@microsoft.com) when an IP hits 100 404 errors across all websites on the server. I have this script running every 15 minutes.\n\nI've never received any responses for the emails sent to [abuse@microsoft.com](mailto:abuse@microsoft.com).\n\nIn the past 24 hours, 56 Microsoft identified IPs were conducting probing attacks. The problem is that this never ends. The IPs constantly shift.\n\nPreviously, I was manually blocking by /24 blocks, but it was too much work to constantly be adding blocks to the firewall, so the script is supposed to handle this, but the attacks and high server load continue.\n\nI literally just temporarily blocked 4.0.0.0/8 and 20.0.0.0/8 just to kill off an attack. MS has many blocks in those two subnets.\n\nUsually, about five times a day, my server is unavailable or degraded due to these probing attacks. A couple days ago, that was ten times that the server was bogged down with these attacks.\n\nThis wasn't a problem a couple years ago, but now it's a major issue.\n\nConversely, when I report these to AWS or Google, they are dealt with quickly.\n\nI've tried to figure out a way to speak with someone at MS about this. I called the number listed with ICANN and managed to figure out how to search by name, and by trying common last names found actual extensions to call (as well as conference rooms). I have yet to actually connect with a human doing this, even when calling someone's direct extension.\n\nI've found others complaining on Microsoft's help forums, and the MS response completely got it wrong, thinking that the their Azure server was being attacked, not that Azure IPs were attacking an outside server. When corrected on this, the MS rep said that they needed an Azure account for help in that matter (completely sidestepping the issue).\n\nHow best to handle this situation?",

My aim is to automate this such that reporting is done automatically to any data center, not just MS.

Like $500k/year is a “reasonable” price. I can definitely see it being impossible, but if you can afford it, it’s worth it. \n\nEven with cloudflare you’re going to see bad traffic. Cloudflare just gives you more tools to block what you need to without breaking real traffic.\n\nBefore cloudflare it was a constant flood of ddos attacks in the range of ~250k unique ips. Vultr, digital ocean, and azure were the worst. In order. Probing is constant from everywhere.\n\nA few things I’ve done that work without cloudflare, but do require some work to put together.\n\n- identify bad requests in your logs, and filter by unique IP addresses, and block all requests. I’ve used memcached with ingress-nginx (rip) access_by_lua to check for banned IPs. It was reasonable to about 100k rps per instance on 6-8y old hardware. \n\n- fail2ban. It doesn’t work with billions of ips, but it’s easy to set up. It’s possible someone has an ebpf method that performs better than iptables, but I haven’t looked in a while. \n\n- properly set up robots.txt\n\n- block requests that you know are bad. I.e specific user agents, invalid hostnames, etc.\n\n- set up reasonable rate limits\n\n- just leave client connections hanging. Instead of returning a 403/429, just don’t send a response. (Nginx 444, it works fantastically for botnets in my experience, and ties up at least some resources on the client for a while.)\n\n- appropriate syn flood thresholds on your edge firewalls.",

This way entire data centers would quickly get blocked. This drastic action was needed because the scrapers were down to using a unique IP for every single hit to circumvent rate limits.\n\nOh and auto whitelist IPs from valid search engines which support this with reverse lookups.\n\nThis helps against rented server farms (legit or not). Unfortunately scraping proxy services utilizing paid or exploited peoples personal IPs exist, too, and if numbers of those in your eyeball networks are high you'll have to resort to some sort of user verification.",

      "text": "We've all experienced and/or heard about the difficulty of getting an entry level job in this field today. However, I would like to have an honest conversation about the reason behind it. I honestly don't know, but I'll give you an honest hiring manager's perspective. \n\nI'm a director at a big(ish) company with a security team of about 20 people. Over the last two years we've tried to fill four entry level roles on our SOC, but were only able to fill two of them. We haven't had a shortage of candidates, but rather a shortage of candidates who were ready for the job. A vast majority of them didn't have any basic networking, operating systems, scripting abilities, or any of the other fundamentals. When it came to \"security skills\" the most I saw was maybe a basic SIEM searching lesson with ELK and maybe a class that showered them Metasploit. However, you could tell the skills didn't really stick because the lack of the aforementioned fundamentals. \n\nMostly, their degrees seemed to be similar to what you would find in a Security+ or CISSP prep course. Mostly theory and risk/compliance. Almost none of them knew what Active Directory was, understood anything about Azure or Amazon's services, or any other common enterprise technology. I know it is harder in school to learn these things, but it wasn't like this a few years ago. Candidates used to know the a basics. \n\nThe two people we hired were students who went out of their way to learn more because they felt their degree wasn't helping too much. Both of them participated in CTFs, had GitHub repos that showed projects they were working on, and other similar initiatives. Almost none of the other candidates had anything besides their degree and a Security+. \n\nI'm not blaming the students, but I believe it's the quality of the programs they attend. These schools that teach them for FOUR YEARS and graduate them like this should be ashamed. I'm sure this isn't the only reason the entry level job market is the way it is, but I can tell you it's certainly part of it. ",

If you don’t have the foundations in place,  how can you expect to build something secure on top?  \n\nIt’s a classic story that a lot of us have been preaching, but often get called gatekeepers for stating.    Cyber Security is not entry level.  It requires foundational understanding on how things work.  You don’t need to know every part,   But you need to have that foundation to build off of because so much of the job involves quickly learning and adapting and you need to have the strong base to build off of.   \n\nTheory is awesome,  but just because I understand the theory behind something doesn’t mean I understand how that theory translates to reality. \n\n\nAnother part of the issue I feel is the combination of schooling,  and the advance in technology.   It wasn’t THAT long ago that it was perfectly normal for many of the foundational skills to be learned by hobbyists before they even entered school.   Building a pc,   Setting up a functional home network or lan gaming,    Easy on-ramps.  Upgrading a pc or repairing a problem,  also easy ways to learn. \n\nBut as tech as evolved and become more app focused and disposable,   There are a lot of people entering the pipeline now who never had to resolve an OS/driver conflict,  or upgrade/fix a pc issue.    They are super comfortable with using technology and the internet,  but their experience as a use is much different than it was for people just 5/10yrs earlier.      \n\nAnd the education system has not evolved to account for the lost fundamentals being learned before entering the system.    They’ve build more advanced theory classes but don’t do any checks that people understand what all that theory is built on top of.

Hurdle #1 for both employees and employers is people have the wrong idea of \"cybersecurity.\" Part of that is the cert mills and academic programs that, at best, teach a lot of NIST-level concepts but they ignore the need to understand good IT fundamentals. Part too is media portrayals, and then a large part does fall on candidates who have unrealistic assessments of their skills, pay, or responsibility. Most of the real security jobs I filled came from internal candidates, people who knew our software, systems, policies etc. There are a lot of organization-specific elements to security roles that, if you can't hire internally, you have to be ready to train and bring people up to speed and that's always a bit of a gamble. There are lots of folks who can pass test with flying color, but they can't think on their feet, work with other departments, or cooperatively problem solve. Those soft skills are harder to find than degrees and certificates.",

Look entry level is the fry guy at micky d's.  That's someone who can distinguish a bell from all the other noise, just so you know BS in CS hiring manager.\n\nLet's get it straight, there is NO entry level in computer security.  \n\nQuit looking at college grads, let them migrate to help desk if they have a desire to be in IT, they will start there. \n\nThe biggest problem in this field is folks think they know it all because they have a degree and feel like they are owed a huge compensation, title, and a corner office for getting a piece of paper and starting life in 120k in debt.  That's a sign of a dumbass in my opinion.

Try recruiting AFK at literally any of the “hacker” conferences and you’ll find tons of highly qualified IT/tech/cybersecurity people available for work (if the company is willing to pay). Companies seem to think that seasoned cybersecurity people have become less valuable because there are “tons of cybersecurity people” now, but the pool of highly qualified candidates isn’t much bigger than it was before, and they’re still in high demand. They just don’t apply for jobs because they don’t have to.\n\n2) the resume screening bots seem to be very bad at screening resumes and often miss the actually qualified candidates.\n\n3) the vast majority of human HR people are incapable of identifying a competent cybersecurity professional because they discredit anyone with poor social skills.\n\nSource: part of my last two jobs was building IT/cybersecurity teams from scratch. It sucked, but it was easy once I hired via referral rather than job postings. If you tell a bunch of hackers you want to hire one of their friends AND you’ll pay them $2,500 if they send you the right person, you’ll be shocked at the extremely highly qualified candidates that will come out of the wood work. I do also want to point out that many of the experienced cyber people were also heavily involved with crypto early on, so many of them only work for the joy of working now because they’re still wired to do the work they love. So, sometimes it’s about creating the right opportunity, rather than waiting for the “right person.”",

I've been interviewing candidates (technical panel) for a year now for 2 orgs and 95% of candidates that make it to the technical interview stage aren't qualified for the senior position they've applied to (can't talk to the basics) or their resume outright lies (had one DevSecOps/SecEng person literally not be able to talk through a single point on their resume). And this was for remote roles.\n\nAt one org, once we finally hired one of the senior candidates, I noticed they struggled to understand how to see Teams/Outlook meeting invites etc. I've since left that org, but I've heard every senior person hired after I left has had to be mentored by junior analysts on all kinds of wild topics a senior role should already know.\n\nI've also been on the candidate side for a bit last year, and it's extremely hard to get into interviews.

I apply for roles and then the phone rings within 30 minutes. If it’s not people telling me I need to have the word infrastructure or this or that because clearly I don’t know what I’m on about, had an Indian recruiter ring me and was adamant that I needed to know what a “benant” was.

Far too many non tech somehow all circle jerking each other off, if it’s not the art of possible or secure by design bollocks- because us cybersecurity architects don’t understand that not everything needs security ( big sigh and rolls eyes emoji )\nI too am in this because I love tech. Clearly somethings a miss.\n\nPart of me thinks it’s all this ats shit recruiters use now. Especially how most recruiters tell me they’ve only just come to this sector. \n\nI presume it’s full of morons all using some rubbish ats 1.0 that’s clearly not tuned correctly or it’s funnelling in a specific type of person. (I’m sure you’ll get my drift - the cheap ones that always say yes, tend to be 50ft away from their mic’s and have a parrot in the background. \n\nI’d love to know the reason but here I am just sat shaking my hand at the world and studying more.\n\nEdit: 20 years in the game. Have a passion for it/tech. It’s a way of life for me. No bs no nonsense I’m one of the true nerds that can do what it says on the tin.

That is the job. \n\nSo companies turned cybersecurity into a tick box circus, and they will start promoting anyone with zero knowledge to these roles and make them political. \n\nThis way, they will have a scape goat if the problems really occur and this means that cybersecurity guy didn't succeed to present properly the risks. \n\nIf nothing happens, they all split fat checks. \nIt's easy to see all these companies. They all have a ciso and some understaffed cybersecurity positions or just a ciso with no budget. \n\nMake no mistake, but cybersecurity is dead. We are seeing the last breath.

Even if you're an admin on the server and have full access to all software, you still won't be able to read data inside the TEE. \n\nSecond, Confer provides remote attestation, which means that you can verify cryptographically on the client side that the data on the server has never left the TEE. Ars Technica has a [pretty decent writeup](https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/signal-creator-moxie-marlinspike-wants-to-do-for-ai-what-he-did-for-messaging/) of the concepts. \n\nSo the entire model on the server is run in a way that even an admin can't look into the conversations and that you have cryptographic proof that the software hasn't been meddled with. I don't think this will even overtake ChatGPT, but that doesn't mean this is some impressive work. ChatGPT got ordered to save hundreds of thousands of chat messages, even when they don't want to, due to a court order. But Confer has no access to the data so it can't be asked to do the same.\n\nIt does happen on some regular occasion that security researchers find a way to weaken or break the security of a TEE, but even then the barrier is much higher for both companies and the government to snoop on Confer vs Chat or Claude.",

It checks that the public key in the quote matches the one used in the handshake–this binds the encrypted channel to the TEE, preventing interception or replay by anything outside it.

If the site ships you malicious javascript it could send your messages to a non trusted environment. This is the same issue with any digital service (incl. Proton) where you need to trust the server to not deliver you wrong payloads. I think it's a reasonable tradeoff though, you have to trust someone at one point.",

I looked past that then during the conversation, he asked me what is my long term plan , I said I love cybersecurity and would love to become an expert, he goes like ‘then this role is not for you’…\n\nWth? , I was mad but I explained that in order to reach my goal I definitely need to start somewhere..\n\nLong story short , after waiting for a month with repeated calls and emails to ask of feedback ( I got no answers by the way ), they just got back to me that the role has been given to someone else and that I was the second best so they will contact me when a new position opens up by the end of Q1 this year.\n\nTo be fair life has been really tough and I’m giving up on my IT and cybersecurity dreams … I just got my SIA badge , I’ll rather take my chances on there done deal with these cooperate stuff.",

It takes at least half a year to bring people up to speed so they can work somewhat unsupervised, which is quite the time-sink and feels just wasteful in this scenario.

Taking a security job to pay bills isn’t “giving up”, it’s just survival.\n\nIf you do decide to keep one foot in IT/cyber, focus less on interviews and more on building confidence again. Hands-on stuff helps a lot with that. Blue-team labs where you actually investigate alerts and incidents are closer to real work than just studying. Platforms like CyberDefenders are good for that because they’re built around SOC workflows, not theory.\n\nEven if you step away for a bit, your interest in cyber doesn’t disappear.

They can provide a foot in the door somewhere.  \n\n2.  TL/DR Break the ice and make it a conversation about the job vs an interview for the job.  The bad vibes thing is never fun.  Sometimes it's just the person has had a crappy day, other times it's them just going through the motions to satisfy some quota of \"I interviewed 3 people\".  That said, I'm not sure if you were in a sterile meeting area or in his office, but one of the first things I do is look around the office to see what stuff the person has on the walls, on a bookcase, desk, etc., and if I can I'll make a call out about it to try and make a connection.  For example, if I see a baseball on someone's desk I'll say something like, \"Who's your team?\" and motion/nod towards the baseball.  (make sure you know something about baseball, however, and don't talk family stuff..way to many landmines there)  \n  \n3.  Know something about the company and the job before you walk in the door.  If working with a Head Hunter ask about who you'll be interviewing with (your success puts money in their pocket).  If via their HR dept, know some of what they do, who they are, even check out linked in (It has to be good for something, after all).  \n  \n4.  One thing I've responded a few times to the \"where do you want to be in X # of years?\" (and you have to read the room for this) is \"I want your job, and I know that to get that I'll have to promote you out of yours\".  A less bold statement and safer statement might be \"I want to learn the business and move into a senior engineer or leadership role.\"  The point being you need to make the person doing the hiring and firing that you're looking to be on his team and have his back.  \n  \nBest of luck and keep trying!",

Telling someone a role isn’t for them simply because they have ambition is a red flag, not real feedback.\n\nFive months of unemployment plus silence and mixed signals can wear anyone down, so choosing the SIA route right now isn’t failure, it’s survival. Do what you need to do to get stable and breathe again. Just don’t let one bad experience convince you that IT or cybersecurity isn’t for you. If and when you’re ready to come back, that door is still open. If you want, I can share links and resources for training, support, and getting back on track when the time feels right.",

I just stuck at it and got the certs I needed (CISSP and Security +, in that order, funny enough). Got the CISSP because I had been an IT director in a previous life, with overall responsibility for security, so someone with a CISSP who knew me from way back sponsored me. Still no luck. But one day, someone needed exactly what I had. They needed a tech support guy with a CISSP. How many of those can you find? So I got the job. Worked for a year as the security guy on the tech support team, then got another job as a security analyst. My boss was ready to counter to keep me, but I told him I needed to be a real security guy, not a security guy on the tech support team. That was over 10 years ago. Been in infosec ever since.

Also includes Saturdays 2-3 hours of work too. I have over 10 years of experience, CISSP, M.S etc. It's been hard lately in finding a job and this is the only job interview that made it to the final round. \nThey have many junior to level staff employed and they are underpaid. I sense this is a toxic workplace full of micromanagement but the job market is SO BAD right now. Or is it just me? Not sure what to do",

Like, whatever household things you need to do ordinarily, get groceries/get an oil change/whatever, those are also not happening in your Saturday hours, *if* 2 or 3 is even what they are limited to. So if job hunting was to happen in the evening or weekends, there's even less of that, and the fact of being on-site. Should you find interest elsewhere, you are very definitely not interviewing without calling out for one reason or another. Also, can I just say: two to three hours on Saturdays is just pants.",

There are a lot of cyber workers which has been inflated in the last few years by a rush toward the industry (with many low experience people in the mix,) and the number of jobs in cyber is flat or shrinking due to automation and the cost of operation (particularly headcount.)  Remote work has always been an unattractive mode of working for most organizations, so the 2020-2022 period was unusual in that the market allowed it because is must to survive. You could even think of it as a serious BC/DR problem, keeping your company going when no one can access the office, except everyone's playing at the same time.  \n  \nNow that we are out of that essentially extended business continuity event, remote work is back to being viewed by organizations (with some exceptions) as less attractive and a perk for employment. In a market where the employer is dominant, perks are reduced because someone else will take the job without it.\n\nThat's the market with live in today.",

End of the day, the company you give your data to is the keyholder and must act responsible. This was literally in HR training material for my first job.\n\nCompanies who handle sensitive user data and payment methods are responsible for doing their due diligence when selecting a contractor. Hiring someone else is not carte blanche to not give a fuck. Ubisoft has enough technical resources to be expected to vet a contractors processes and policies for handling data, more than enough technical know-how to be held liable in the case of a breach. It might be different for small businesses or solo, non-technical workers who don't have the capacity or knowledge to assess a vendor's security practices. But Ubisoft is not such an organization.\n\nIn this case it's probably not relevant unless actual consumer data or payment methods are shown to be compromised due to the outsourcing, but your statement is just wrong.",

The confirmed part is that a single hacker was able to spawn $339 trillion in in-game currency, forcing Ubisoft to take their servers offline for a rollback.\n\nThat's the real breach. Not the data exfiltration, but the lack of integrity controls.\n\nSome kid didn't steal a roadmap; they fundamentally broke the game's economy from the inside. That points to a catastrophic failure in server-side validation and anti-tamper controls. It means the game trusted the client in a way it never should have.\n\nThe data leak might be 'blown out of proportion,' but the fact that their production environment was so easily manipulated is the story that should have every security engineer at Ubisoft in a panic room. That's the vulnerability that will be exploited again and again, long after this 'leak' is forgotten.",

It was probably done through some backend panel since they primarily gave out currency and banned random players. None of that is ever mediated through the client. If the source code leak is real, then it would have been through the same vector. The real question is how they obtained credentials with that level of permission for production.

          "text": "\"A new sample of the ToneShell backdoor, typically seen in Chinese cyberespionage campaigns, has been delivered through a kernel-mode loader in attacks against government organizations.\n\nThe backdoor has been attributed to the Mustang Panda group, also known as HoneyMyte or Bronze President, that usually targets government agencies, NGOs, think tanks, and other high-profile organizations worldwide.\n\nSecurity researchers at Kaspersky analyzed a malicious file driver found on computer systems in Asia and discovered that it has been used in campaigns since at least February 2025 against government organizations in Myanmar, Thailand, and other Asian countries.\n\nEvidence showed that the compromised entities had prior infections with older ToneShell variants, PlugX malware, or the ToneDisk USB worm, also attributed to state-sponsored Chinese hackers.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, the new ToneShell backdoor was deployed by a mini-filter driver named ProjectConfiguration.sys and signed with a stolen or leaked certificate valid between 2012 and 2015 and issued to Guangzhou Kingteller Technology Co., Ltd.\n\nMini-filters are kernel-mode drivers that plug into the Windows file-system I/O stack and can inspect, modify, or block file operations. Security software, encryption tools, and backup utilities typically use them.\n\nProjectConfiguration.sys embeds two user-mode shellcodes in its .data section, each executed as a separate user-mode thread to be injected into user-mode processes.\n\nTo evade static analysis, the driver resolves required kernel APIs at runtime by enumerating loaded kernel modules and matching function hashes, rather than importing functions directly.\n\nIt registers as a mini-filter driver and intercepts file-system operations related to deletion and renaming. When such operations target the driver itself, they are blocked by forcing the request to fail.\n\nThe driver also protects its service-related registry keys by registering a registry callback and denying attempts to create or open them. To ensure priority over security products, it selects a mini-filter altitude above the antivirus-reserved range.\n\nAdditionally, the rootkit interferes with Microsoft Defender by modifying the configuration of the WdFilter driver so it is not loaded into the I/O stack.\n\nTo shield injected user-mode payloads, the driver maintains a list of protected process IDs, denies handle access to those processes while the payloads are executing, and removes protection once execution completes.\n\n\"This is the first time we’ve seen ToneShell delivered through a kernel-mode loader, giving it protection from user-mode monitoring and benefiting from the rootkit capabilities of the driver that hides its activity from security tools,\" says Kaspersky.\n\nThe new variant of the ToneShell backdoor that Kaspersky analyzed features changes and stealth enhancements. The malware now uses a new host identification scheme based on a 4-byte host ID market instead of the 16-byte GUID used previously, and also applies network traffic obfuscation with fake TLS headers.\n\nIn terms of the supported remote operations, the backdoor now supports the following commands:\n\n0x1 — Create a temporary file for incoming data\n\n0x2 / 0x3 — Download file\n\n0x4 — Cancel download\n\n0x7 — Establish a remote shell via a pipe\n\n0x8 — Receive operator command\n\n0x9 — Terminate shell\n\n0xA / 0xB — Upload file\n\n0xC — Cancel upload\n\n0xD — Close connection\n\nKaspersky advises that memory forensics is key in uncovering ToneShell infections backed by the new kernel-mode injector.\n\nThe researchers have high confidence in attributing the new ToneShell backdoor sample to the Mustang Panda cyberespionage group. They assess that the threat actor has evolved its tactics, techniques, and procedures to gain operational stealth and resilience.\n\nThe cybersecurity company provides in its report a short list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) to help organizations detect Mustang Panda intrusions and defend against them.\"",

          "text": "Hi there, 12 years in IT, about 8 of that in cybersecurity. Worked for all sorts of orgs. Currently a Security Engineer. CISSP. What I'll describe is like 90% of what you'll see, but some orgs may have their own custom titles, or break these down into even more granular roles. \n\n* **Security Analyst** (entry level)\n\n  * Basic entry level role, and sort of a catch-all. This role is mostly going to be \"grunt work\", or basic repetitive tasks, with more senior analysts being in charge of some basic projects or changes (as they move into a security engineer level of knowledge/responsibility). That isn't to demean the role, this role is CRITICAL to a good security team. You'll be doing things like reviewing alerts (See SOC Analyst after this), or doing basic configuration tasks. You'll also be working with helpdesk for auth issues (See IAM analyst). In medium orgs, this role can be thought of as a \"Junior Security Engineer\"\n\n* **SOC Analyst** (entry level, specialized)\n\n  * In larger orgs, they can have a dedicated person (or team) dedicated to managing their SOC, or Security Operations Center. This role is almost exclusively going to be managing and watching alerts, and that's it. In bigger orgs, you'll have more specialized roles that focus on one thing versus many things (Like a Security Analyst).\n\n* **IAM Analyst** (entry level, specialized)\n\n  * Like SOC analyst, some orgs are large enough to have a person or team whose sole job is IAM (Identity Access Management). Basically these are the people who handle account creation, termination, password policies, MFA ops, and maybe sign-in troubleshooting. They work closely with helpdesk, but aren't typically a department that takes direct calls from users. In smaller orgs, Security Analysts handle this (and sometimes helpdesk may do parts of it as well)\n\n* **Security Engineer** (mid/senior)\n\n  * This is basically \"Sysadmin who specialized in cybersecurity\". It is NOT entry level, typically wants 5-10 years experience and some hard hitting certs. People with deep technical knowledge and the ability to apply it. They often function as Tier 2 for security analysts and SOC analysts. Typically responsible for implementing bigger changes with more technical uplift, and can solve complex tasks that require a tech-focused security input. Worth noting that *typically* this role is more infrastructure focused, and less programming/coding focused, though a good security engineer can do both. This role in medium orgs will handle all aspects of security, but some orgs may break it out into roles (Like Cloud Engineer or AppSec)\n\n* **Cloud Security Engineer** (mid/senior, specialized)\n\n  * Like security engineer, but you live exclusively inside Azure, AWS, etc. Larger orgs with huge infrastructure need dedicated people in this role, but smaller orgs will just have regular security engineers take this role. \n\n* **AppSec** (mid/senior, specialized)\n\n  * Not much to say. It's a programmer who focuses on security. You'll be reviewing code for issues, making sure APIs are tight, recommending or making those changes, ensuring things like input validation or other OWASP techniques are being implemented in code. Basically plugging holes that your dev team makes (and your dev team will 100% make holes). Sometimes Cloud Security Engineers handle this in smaller orgs, and Security Engineers in even smaller ones. \n\n* **DevSecOps** (mid/senior, specialized)\n\n  * Similar to Appsec, but more focused on the pipeline than the actual application. Basically making sure that integrations, secrets, etc are taken care of. In smaller orgs, this would roll up to AppSec or Cloud Security engineer (which can roll up to just the security engineer in even smaller orgs)\n\n* **Security Architect** (senior)\n\n  * This is somewhere between Security Engineer, a project manager, and a Manager of a Security department. Think of it as Tier 3 (Engineer T2, Analyst T1). They're less \"hands on\" with day-to-day ops, but more so the overall security design. They're not managing \"people\" like a manager would, but they are more or less responsible for what all the people do. This gets into high level stuff, especially regulatory and compliance where certain aspects need to be met. In smaller orgs, they may function as a \"Senior Security Engineer\"\n\n* **Penetration Tester** (mid/senior, specialized)\n\n  * You know what this is. Red hat folks, sole job is breaking in and making a very detailed report on how they did it. It isn't as glamorous as it seems. 10% is hacking, 50% is making reports on how you did it, and 40% is helping a customer (or internal team) figure out how to fix it. Some orgs may have internal roles (like Security Engineers) do some light internal pentesting, but will still usually pay a pentesting company for \"official\" results.\n\n* **GRC** (entry/mid/senior, non-technical)\n\n  * Governance, Risk and Compliance. These people often aren't technical(+), but are usually just one part auditor and one part risk management. If a technical security person finds something that's a problem that needs fixing, the GRC person will look at that risk, figure out how bad it is, rank it accordingly based on business and regulatory needs, then advise managers (and the general security team) what to prioritize. \n\n  * + *(Note that I said this role isn't technical, some orgs do hire technical people into this role, but in many orgs it is not. It's not uncommon to see business risk management have someone in here)* \n\n* **Compliance** (entry/mid/senior, specialized, non-technical) \n\n  * Similar to above, but sometimes not even part of a security department. You'll see this role especially in healthcare with things like HIPAA or HITECH where compliance and regulations are extremely important enough to warrant a dedicated person.",

Also did a LOT of powershell automation. The point is that HR defines the role, based on the need of the org.

          "text": "Let's break your questions down:\n\n>While I understand that titles can be anything in different companies and scale\n\nActualy, that's not entirely true. Roles are quite defined and standard by now (appsec engineer, devsecops engineer, cloud security engineer, the ones that you mentioned, are pretty standard). But what often happens is that people specializes in the specific technologies of their company. But if you learn the concepts of one world, you can use them on another. \n\nBut this happens in all tech areas. Every field has their own technologies, languages, methods, etc. \n\n> what roles are closer to not being too specialized in it’s knowledge and work\n\nYou mentioned them. It may be confussing sometimes, just because not always the terminology is standard, but the role is. Sometimes you may not find cloud security engineer, but AWS security engineer, for example. Or ethical hacker, instead of pentester. \n\nOf course, you may find sub specialty roles, like Pentester Web (as sub specialty of pentester), or Internal Auditor (as sub specialty of GRC Specialists). \n\n>what do the most common titles mean?\n\nI dunno what to answer here. \n\nHowever, let me tell you a common mistake on applicants: not specializing. I use to think like you, that knowing a little of all areas would give me advantage, and it may happen (there's always companies who look for 5 roles in one person). But at the end, it's more common for companies to look on a specific role. Why? Because knowledge on a specific field is too broad that it's quite impossible to gain expertise in more than one field. So I would never expect you to be an expert in cloud security, appsec, and devsecops.\n\nHowever, context matters. As every day there are more and more companies (startups). It´s very frequent to find generalist positions. Because, of course, a startup does not have the budget to hire a full security team. But, usually their scopes are very small, which makes it easire to handle.\n\nAlso, let's not confuse the \"entry\" level of security engineer, where usually the engineer is learning a little of different areas. But their scope is limited too. But at some point, they need to grow and gain more experience that can only be achieved through specialization. Do notice that I used quotation marks, because security is not an entry field, as you already require knowledge of several technologies to start, even as an entry level. \n\nFinally... yes. The market is bad right now. But that goes for all tech positions. People continues saying that technology is the best bet to have a well paid work. But what they do not realize is that they are pushing the market to overflood with candidates (sometimes with low or mediocre training), making it more difficult to find jobs. Also, consider that the last couple of years, all companies (not only tech) had massive layoffs, overflooding the market even more. So, yes... this is a bad moment. \n\nHow to deal with it? Become an expert in your field. When your resume speaks for yourself and becomes a differentiator among all the other dozens of unprepared candidates, your chances are higher.",

          "text": "I just did six months out of work. I start a new gig later this month, here's what I had to do. \n\nLinkedin full of all the right words, nobody is going to actually read it, but it has to scan well enough for both bot or person to see what they want. \n\nI searched every single technology recruitment firm (not corporate recruitment as part of their HR) and messaged each and every one of them with my resume. Some only communicate on linkedin via messaging, some have their own web page with a form you fill and some just have email. Write an introductory blurb you can recycle and use it for your email or forms. I could hit about 30 in about two hours if I were focused. I filtered based on US location (but you may do it differently) and more than 10k followers. You'll hit some duds and dead ends, but it is a numbers game. Remember 3rd party recruiters only get paid when they fill a spot. You don't have to be the best person for the role, you just have to be easy to sell and most importantly AVAILABLE immediately. They are incentivized to pump you up for the interview. This approach got me the most traction. I had quite a few interviews with this approach, I got my last job using this method. Sadly, I couldn't close any positions I interviewed for, probably close to a dozen calls. \n\nOf all the irony, I got my current role by doing the thing I've NEVER in my life done. I applied on the company website, interviewed and got the role. Seriously, this approach has gotten me the fewest number of interviews and has never, until now, resulted in a job. \n\nI did not waste my time redoing my resume for each and every job. If you're applying to similar roles, there should be no reason to do this. I bought a subscription to Teal, I didn't find it very useful. It was slow and clunky, there was no button that would just tune your resume. It would just show you what was wrong and tell you to fix it. Would not recommend. I bought another that literally robo-filled applications for you on a select number of websites. It worked REALLY well, so if you're going for straight numbers, you might want to do it. You populated your data, gave it search criteria and just let it run. It seriously just auto-fills EVERYTHING for you, never got hung up or stuck and just ran as long as you let it run. You have to buy credits to fuel it, but they were cheap. I think it was called LiftMyCV.",

Compliance and grc can greatly impact finances if something goes wrong, but it's often a backburnered position. \n\nThe battle you're facing is one of being unique in your field. This is going to require things like making your resume a bit more modern. Try looking at different resume templates on places like canva for ideas on that front. You'll also need individualized cover letters for each position you apply for. Since 90% of the resumes your sending out are filtered through ai before they even get to a person, cover letters add extra bs to the like that may satisfy the rubric they're grading applicants on. \n\nLastly, networking is going to be your friend. You're going to need to use LinkedIn or go to some in person conferences and \"expand your professional network\" to get your resume and skills in front of more people. My success rate on blind applications is far lower than jobs referred by someone in my network. \n\nGood luck!",

You don’t need all 3, just that FAANG is #1 choice and that makes you stand out a lot. \n\n1) FAANG Experience - Your resume will be looked at and considered. \n\n2) Masters Degree - HR gatekeeping checkpoint.

Whether they are right to think it or not I can see recruiters and HR seeing that as potentially not related experience due to the word “instructor” your next role flows on to the next page and was before covid. You already mentioned the clearance issue but I could also see these two things holding it back. I’m not the most experienced person out there but I have recruiters out of the blue hitting me up ever so often on LinkedIn for jobs and I assume it’s because of my resume. I list everything in bullets and keep any descriptions to one line as much as possible while keep text and character spacing as compact as possible so it’s all on one page.

America’s cyber vulnerabilities aren’t about org charts, they’re about:\n\nOutdated government IT systems\n\nCritical infrastructure weaknesses (power grids, water treatment, healthcare)\n\nPoor coordination between existing agencies (CISA, FBI cyber, military cyber commands)\n\nThe fact that most targets are *civilian*, not military\n\nThe philosophical split is interesting: one camp sees cyber as a warfighting domain requiring military solutions, the other sees it as primarily a civilian infrastructure problem that adding another Pentagon branch won’t fix.\n\nWorth noting that U.S. Cyber Command already exists and coordinates across Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. The question is whether a dedicated branch would improve things or just add another layer to an already fragmented ecosystem.\n\nThe timing matters, nation-state actors (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) are getting more sophisticated, and we’re still dealing with fallout from incidents like Colonial Pipeline and SolarWinds that hit civilian infrastructure, not military targets.\n\nThoughts?\n\nSource: [The Signal - Military Leaders Question New Cyber Force](https://www.thes1gnal.com/article/military-leaders-question-new-cyber-force-debate-intensifies-over-federal-cybers)",

Two things can happen simultaneously. And the creation of a branch is for a different purpose than the creation of a major command. Yes, the command exists, however the existence of it doesn’t kill justification for a cyber branch. That is like saying we have CENTCOM so we don’t need the Army as a branch. The point of the branch is coordinated force generation that is removed from the priorities of the other branches, as there isn’t a need for a cyber operator to be a Marine or a Soldier, per se. They need to be a cyber operator. And the army and USMC just may not be the best way to create them or set their training priorities. ",

This creates a chaotic environment where operators sitting next to one another are held to vastly different standards depending on the uniform they wear.\n\nA unified Cyber Force is the only path forward.

Anyone in that branch would probably have a TS clearance and be targets of adversaries.\n\nPros:\n-Uniform standards and training hopefully optimized to produce the best talent.\n\n-Service specific duties and overhead can be removed: No more sending cyber Marines to recruiter or embassy duty just because their branch requires it. The PT and administrative requirements that were variable across the branches are now uniform.\n\n-Culture shifts to academic and professional excellence instead of service ideology.\n\n-Increased retention due to less non-technical administrative burdens and antiquated ideas.\n\n***\n\nHow I think it should be done:\n\nUS Cybercom billets become the new Cyberforce branch billets. A Cyberforce bootcamp and AIT lead to those billets.\n\nServices still have cyber personnel that go through their own bootcamps, but then they go through Cyberforce AIT, and then back to their service afterwards.",

          "text": "So first of all, as noted, US Cybercommand already exists and is a quite functional cross-branch mission. Making it its own branch would probably only serve to hamstring collaboration. Technological vulnerability is not a domain in the same way land, sea, air, space are -- it's a domain that exists wherever technology does, i.e. in all of those places.\n\nSecond of all, by far the gains in sophistication and scale have been made on the cybercrime front, not from nation-state nexus actors ... this has served to seriously complicate the national security situation by injecting a ton of ambiguity and volume of malicious activity into the system. Attribution is harder, attack chain components as a service sold by ecrime actors are leveraged by nation-state, the relationship between governments and malicious actors acting within their sphere of influence provides gains via economies of scale, i.e. when an adversary needs opportunistic access to a company or person based on shifting geopolitical realities the chance they can just lean heavy on a crime actor to seize existing access is at an all time high.\n\nThe best \"easy\" thing to do to clarify the operational picture would be to aggressively, very aggressively go after ecrime operators. What's the difference between them and South American drug cartels? Since it's no problem to just strike inside sovereign borders send a missile in rather than spend 2 years on a disruption that doesn't even arrest the top tier leadership.",

          "text": "So, the thing people are forgetting about the whole \"make it a branch\" thing, is that the primary purpose of a military branch these days is to pay for things. I.e. \"man train and equip\" to then provide forces to combatant commands. The Navy or the Airforce don't fight wars, INDOPACOM and EUCOM do.\n\nThe reason a Space Force was stood up, but not a cyber force, is that Spacd assets were getting expensive enough that no single service had enough room in their budgets to support what they needed from space. So in an attempt to reduce possible redundancy and limit fights over space assets, Space Force was created. Not to fight in space or anything like that, but to consolidate the funding.\n\nPeople here talking about military cyber are completely uninformed about how it actually works. There already IS a joint force school everyone has to send their sailors/soldiers/airmen/etc. through. And to my knowledge, the Navy was the last holdout on making a dedicated Cyber officer and enlisted community. So they aren't being ranked against pilots and tankers and such, they are being ranked against the rest of the service cyber talent.\n\nLast but possibly most important, the career paths for the service cyber people mostly looks like a rotating role at CYBERCOM and their service cyber needs. The entire point of that is to try and cross pollinate the knowledge so that there isn't just a silo of really expert people and an entire joint force of clueless idiots.\n\nA \"Cyber Force\" will make sense when the cost of cyber capabilities grows so large that they need a dedicated department at the Pentagon to run the funding. And I personally don't think that would be a good thing for the military cyber community, because now they have to fight with all the other, more established branches for the same limited budget, while losing any of the emotional weight of the traditional services when lobbying Congress.",

Rather than solve problems they love to ignore problems to push them off onto someone else. \n\nExample: generals get promoted for delivering ahead of schedule. If they find a quality problem that threatens soldiers lives or mission success they usually prefer to ignore it to ensure their own performance delivery and let someone else figure it out after delivery. \n\nNo one is surprised that generals don't want to give up command, capabilities, responsibility, and without a clear argument otherwise I'm not sure that the military needs 20 branches.",

The goal was to stop bookmarking dead GitHub repos and create a searchable, filterable database.\n\nSince then, the list has grown from \\~100 to **930+ tools**.\n\n**What changed:**\n\n* **Search & Filtering:** You can now filter specifically by category (e.g., \"Social Media\", \"Dark Web\", \"People Search\") to cut through the noise.\n* **Community Submission:** The biggest request was the ability to add tools. I’ve added a submission engine so if you maintain a repo or find a new tool, you can add it to the index yourself.\n* **Availability Status:** We are tracking which tools are free vs. paid (and those that are \"freemium\" traps).\n\n**The Directory:** You can browse the full list here: [**https://think-pol.com/tools**](https://think-pol.com/tools)\n\n**No login required.** No paywall. Just a clean index.\n\nI’m currently doing a manual review to tag the \"Risk Level\" of the new batch (flagging tools that are aggressive scrapers vs. passive lookups). If you see a tool that is miscategorized or broken, please use the report/submit button so I can fix it.\n\nHope this helps in your work.",

It was also unreliable with the agent frequently failing and needing a service restart or reboot to restore functionality. Hands down the worst security related product I have had the displeasure of working with.\n\nAsset Management DB (doesn't matter which vendor). If the team that supports it thinks it should contain hostnames and maybe IP addresses only that it won't help the security team at all. You need IT owner (who will make changes to the box), business owner, some description of what it does, what versions of what software are running on it, what is vulnerable on it, location of asset, operating system, and so on. AMDB isn't a checkbox or a point solution. It takes people to manage effectively.\n\nLANDesk AV. It was a rebranded Kaspersky engine with less management features and no centralized logging.  It did however block things including production software and due to aforementioned lack of tuning ability was set to alert only. The thing of nightmares.\n\nThreat Intelligence Platform (doesn't matter what vendor). Usefulness depends on your organization's maturity. If you can't use a TIP to automatically update security appliances/products with near realtime info you probably are not ready for a TIP. If your security team doesn't have the authority or capability to block things (hash, IP, URL) you are probably not ready for a TIP.\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\nRSA eCAT - an early EDR platform. Did an OK job at enumerating processes. Not a good job at threat rating. Assigned a threat score of 1 - 1023 with 1023 being the highest. RAM scraping malware was a 6. Authentic SharePoint .dlls were in the hundreds. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\nLogRhythm - had performance issues ingesting logs. That and the process of ingesting a log had many steps where if any failed the data processor or indexer simply stopped. Decent enough SIEM otherwise.",

It’s slow, painful, and easy to mess up.\n\nI’m curious — how are other teams handling this?\nAre you using spreadsheets, GRC tools, Notion, something else?\n\nI’m asking because I started building a small internal tool to search across our policies and past answers using AI, and it’s already saving us a ton of time.

These types are mostly from larger customers so we absolutely engage with them (we want cyber to be seen internally as a value-add proposition rather than a sales roadblock). \n\nOur current solution is a word document with key bullet points as answers from previous questionnaires, and a selection of redacted policies/plans pre-approved for sharing, all in one location, where we can copy/paste/update easily - far from perfect but, but eases some of the workload for us.",

Add columns for \"alternative question 1\", \"alternative question 2\" to make keyword searching more effective. (free [Notion template here](https://www.notion.so/2cf8369439288046911cff236e8eecb7?v=2cf836943928809ba494000c5462467b&source=copy_link))\n* Use ChatGPT / LLM with care. Using your exported knowledge base from above + an LLM can be effective but you need to check each answer to make sure it ties back to KB entry or is empty if there is nothing relavent.\n* Use a dedicated tool. There are a few out there: Vanta and Drata have them as a bundled add on. Conveyor is great for larger orgs with dedicated compliance teams. I'm building ResponseHub specifically for smaller teams (self-serve, PAYG pricing, built in explainers).",

Most teams have policies, audits, past questionnaires, and risk decisions scattered across tools, so every new questionnaire becomes a manual reconciliation exercise. That’s where inconsistencies creep in.\n\nA few patterns I keep noticing:\n\n* Teams start with spreadsheets because they’re flexible, then they collapse under version control and ownership issues.\n* GRC tools help with compliance tracking, but they’re often rigid when it comes to narrative, context-heavy questionnaires.\n* Notion works for early-stage teams, but it doesn’t scale well once audits, vendors, and regulators get involved.\n\nThe teams that suffer less are the ones that standardize *how* answers are governed, assign clear ownership, map controls, and agree on a shared language before worrying about tooling. Automation helps, but only after that foundation exists.\n\nYour AI approach makes sense to me, especially for search and consistency. The bigger question is how teams ensure answers stay aligned with actual controls and risk posture over time, not just fast responses.\n\nCurious to see how others here are balancing speed vs accuracy as well.",

That’s why the questions keep growing, even when 80% of them don’t change the actual risk decision.\n\nThe only thing that really scales is having a single, well-maintained source of truth: clear policies, mapped controls, pre-approved evidence, and a documented scope. Tools and AI can help you retrieve and format answers faster, but they don’t replace judgment.

The commonality among governance, risk, and compliance is they are all strategic in nature, meaning they are mostly in the hands of the senior level of an organization (e.g., board or ownership). While there are components that are operational, that's mostly the box checking, the data collection. Translating that data into an actionable strategy, however, takes a lot of experience and general business acumen.  Whether addressing GRC in a third-party role (auditing or consulting) or internally, it can be very challenging because you end up sandwiched between a senior level that might not respect your strategic insight and operational employees who don't think you have the technical chops.

          "text": "Would you trust an E1 to lead you into battle?\n\nA long time ago, people on LinkedIn tried to argue that you didn't need technical experience or a home lab to make it in cybersecurity. And now, I am going to grab an excerpt from an article I wrote in response to this:\n\nYou need to see what it really takes to get your compliance initiative off the ground, so that you can be sure that your team of engineers can actually pull off what you're going to put on them.\n\nWhat will you have to say when a customer asks you a tough question that requires actual hands-on knowledge? Ask the engineers you tasked with an assignment without actually knowing whether or not the job was done correctly? I couldn’t fathom being responsible for building or managing (and attesting to the deliverables from) a team of cybersecurity professionals if I didn’t have some form of hands-on experience in what I was managing. Most people work their way up to management from said trenches; whereas they have developed, through trials and tribulation, the skills necessary to guarantee a good job is done.\n\nHaving hands-on experience sifting through logs or applying procedure to policy hints at a much deeper degree of understanding and capability. This is what companies are really looking for today. Not a master of theory. Not a pencil pusher. A practitioner. A doer. They want someone they can trust.\n\nWhen you are getting a job in cyber, you are being trusted to handle the most sensitive aspects of a business. If all you have is some theory and limited experience with online lab exercises, but you’ve “never actually touched a router” or applied a ZTA framework to a network design (or even used a console cable) then how can you expect a business to take you seriously and entrust the physical routers and their actual IT infrastructure to you when you are supposed to “know this stuff” inside and out? Are they supposed to just trust that you can provide legitimate attestation of compliance that would stand up to scrutiny or hold up in a court of law? Audits must be verified, because there are times when automated scans will come back missing key information about infrastructure or services, or cannot be performed on sensitive architecture.\n\nYes, we have jobs that don’t require you to physically touch things, but these all require skills that in of themselves will expose you to what you would have seen in your own lab anyways. Being prepared; knowing what you are looking at; is worth gold. With hands-on experience, you won't just know what it really takes to get a stack up to snuff, you'll know how to prove it was done correctly. You won't be able to do that otherwise.\n\nEnd excerpt. With all that being said, GRC is not a beginner-friendly job because, as I mentioned in the trials and tribulations bit, you need to know what it really looks like to take a system, harden it, apply policy that aligns with an organizational goal, and provide legitimate attestation of compliance. It is more suited for people that value a desk job more than the thrill of the chase, and people tend to loathe auditors. Orin Thomas  of Microsoft famously refers to them during his seminars as \"The Guys With Ties,\" and frames them as  villains.",

I hated it in school and I hate dealing with it but it is such an important component when dealing with anything policy related. I personally feel like one should have some kind of sysadmin or maybe cyber analyst experience before looking into GRC. I’m sure others may have different perspectives but there is so much to keep in mind when you’re dealing with this stuff especially in GovTech. Not to sound dramatic but it’s no joke and it’s a beast. I will always give props to people who are in GRC related roles. I couldn’t do it. If it’s something you’re genuinely interested in though, I say go for it regardless. Just please do as much research as possible and network with people who are in that field.",

Someone who’s very strong technically but has poor communication skills and never learned out to write can often be a very bad fit.  It’s also important they think systematically.  GRC you can’t just do one thing well.  You have to think across the organization how different processes tie together.  If you tend to be someone that can do that, may be a good fit.

It also requires a fair handle on general tech subjects so you can speak about them eloquently and understand how it fits in your slice of GRC.  I would argue it isn't easy to be successful.  I will agree that hiring managers tend to put the wrong bodies in GRC spots often.  \n\nGRC also is not for people with tech backgrounds that NEED to get their hands dirty.  You will have almost zero opportunity to fix something that isn't a process or procedure.  You also will not want to seek that out as GRC because when you get busy, it's real tedious, and others will just expect you to help the stuff you added on because \"That GRC person never seems busy\".    \n\nHonestly, the two spots I've seen in most large orgs that are easy/coastable spots are:\n\nVulnerability Reporting - and I don't mean people who do actual vulnerability management but the ones who merely run the tool and do reports.  They often won't be trained very well on whatever tool they're using, they'll often claim that \"managing\" the vulnerability is on the owners of the system, not on their team as they just report them.   I've been at numerous big orgs at this point and it's the same story - vuln management just reports, doesn't fix.   And they'll almost never be able to do the report you want.  \n\nThird Party Risk Management - no offense to the TPRM folks in the crowd, but I've never met another team that acts like managing the relationship with a vendor through surveys is the most grueling thing they've ever done in their life.  My main friend in TPRM sends me messages almost every day about how he didn't wake up until noon and no one came looking for him.  The other people on his team show up and leave at all hours and no one cares.  It's absolutely fucking mind blowing to me.   The other big orgs I've been at had one, maybe two people doing this work - this one has a team and they're not that much bigger of an org.  You want a cake walk?  This is it.",

Feel free to correct me or add something in the comments!\n\nDisclaimer 2: This post is hand-crafted! Don’t make my immaculate formatting skills fool you into thinking it’s AI!\n\nSome time ago, my [post about children as young as seven ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1pi3ipq/children_as_young_as_seven_are_being_referred_to/)being referred to Britain's national cybercrime intervention programme blew up. The discussion in the comments (particularly around parental responsibility) inspired me to compile this list of beginner-friendly cybersecurity resources you can share with your kids or anyone who wants to start their career in the industry.  \n  \n========\n\n**Hands-On Learning Platforms:**\n\n[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) \\- Needs no introduction. Offers everything from Windows/Linux fundamentals to professional-grade content. Free tier available with 1-hour daily VM access, paid version $7.35 or $16.99, depending on the monthly/annual subscription. \n\n[HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) \\- Another industry-leading hands-on learning platform. Haven’t found the personal plans, though, but I remember there was one (have they pivoted into enterprise entirely?)\n\n[OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) \\- Gamified labs (requires basic Linux terminal knowledge)\n\n[KC7](https://kc7cyber.com/) \\- Another platform for hands-on practice, a free cyber detective game\n\n[Pwn College](https://pwn.college/) \\- Platform by ASU for vulnerability research\n\n[HexTree](https://www.hextree.io/) \\- An Additional learning platform where you can test real websites to find the flags\n\n[Kusto Detective Agency](https://detective.kusto.io/) \\- For learning KQL (Kusto Query Language)\n\nCapture the flag: [CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/) (for lists of online competitions), [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) \\- Great for CTF challenges\n\n**YouTube Channels:**\n\n[PowerCert Animated Videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/PowerCertAnimatedVideos) \\- Really good infographics for networking concepts\n\n[Branch Education](https://www.youtube.com/c/BranchEducation) \\- Technical explanations on how tech works from the inside\n\n[Sunny Classroom](https://www.youtube.com/@sunnyclassroom24) \\- Educational content by Associate Professor of the Cybersecurity Program at the University of Saint Mary\n\n[NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/networkchuck) \\- Has a \"Hacker's Roadmap\" series and other cybersecurity content (note: videos can be ad-heavy and jump around topics)\n\n[Professor Messer ](https://www.youtube.com/professormesser)\\- A+ courses and other IT fundamentals\n\n**Online Courses (Free/Low-Cost):**\n\n[Google Cybersecurity Course](https://grow.google/intl/uk/google-career-certificates/cybersecurity/) (Coursera/Grow.Google) - Beginner-friendly, certification available at a low cost\n\n[ISC2 CC Certification](https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cc) \\- Currently offering free training and certification\n\n[Cisco Skills for All](https://www.netacad.com/) \\- Free courses in cybersecurity, threat management, and networking\n\n[Cisco Ethical Hacker Course](http://netacad.com/courses/ethical-hacker) \\- 70-hour free course\n\n[Security Blue Team](https://www.securityblue.team/) \\- Free courses and entry-level Blue Team Level 1 cert (practical and open book)\n\n[The Cyber Mentor Academy](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/) \\- Free practical help desk training\n\n[Black Hills Information Security](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/) \\- Free resources, including the Information Security Survival Guide series\n\n[PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security) \\- Excellent for web security\n\n[Hacker High School ](https://www.hackerhighschool.org/) \\- Designed specifically for young learners\n\n**Books:**\n\n\"The Cuckoo's Egg\" by Cliff Stoll - Story of one of the first international hacks, excellent for understanding infosec foundations\n\n**GitHub Resources:**\n\nSearch for \"Awesome\" lists: [Awesome CTF](https://github.com/apsdehal/awesome-ctf), [Awesome Hacking](https://github.com/carpedm20/awesome-hacking), [Awesome Pentest](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-pentest), [Awesome Security](https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security), etc.\n\n[Cybersources repo](https://github.com/bst04/cybersources/tree/main) \\- Comprehensive collection of beginner resources\n\n**General Advice:**  \nLearn computer hardware first - open up a PC, identify components, and understand what each does.

We’re obsessed with the \"cool\" stuff, the zero-day exploits and the nation-state actors.......but 90% of the breaches I actually see (or read about in post-mortems) start with a simple misconfigured S3 bucket or a leaked credential that had way more permissions than it ever needed.\n\nIs it just that \"Least Privilege\" is too boring to sell to leadership? Or is it that actually enforcing it is so manual and painful that we’d rather just buy a shiny new tool and hope for the best?\n\nI’ve been trying to document some \"sanity-first\" IAM guardrails on OrbonCloud lately to help bridge that gap, but It'd be helpful(for the sub also) to hear how you guys keep the basics from slipping while everyone else is distracted by the latest \"AI\" security buzzword.",

Half my day is “No, you can’t use a username and password for that. Use a managed identity” and “your access isn’t working because you’re hitting this policy which is blocking your IP, which looks to be public”.\n\nThe SecOps guys are experts at security.

The basics, like least privileges, need to be integrated into the day-to-day workflow in a way that adds value to the people doing the work.  For example, consider the process and workflows around data flows and firewall ACLs.  The goal is the least amount of network access that still allows the application, system, or software to operate and perform well.  For many sys admins, the goal is to get their stuff working on the network.  The primary objective is functionality and performance, not necessarily least access or least privileges on the network.  Security and compliance’s primary objective is security, which includes least access and least privileges.  To maintain the basics over time, the process has to add value to both groups of people.  Meaning, from the sys admins’ perspective, the process should produce connectivity quickly, and from the security perspective, the connectivity should be optimized for security. \n\nThe challenge is that the complexity of this exercise increases with the size and complexity of the organization.  At some inflection point, spreadsheets, emails, and tickets cannot accommodate the workflow efficiently, and the basics start to get undermined due to urgency, lack of patience, and simply frustration with the process. \n\nIts all about understanding the goals of the people in the process and then optimizing the process to achieve the goals efficiently.  Easier said then done though.",

Good IAM requires a very good base of organization and most companies blew that to shit years ago. For example team of of people with same role all have different access instead of RBAC with same access. It makes it hard when everyone is a unicorn for access and no role groups.  Another area is unstructured data, where they have dlp or ransomware risk/wants, yet don’t want to fix it due to effort and required tools cost.  Finally they then buy IAM tool and wonder why it is a flaming terd due to automation doesn’t work well when whole environment is unicorn and not built on a solid base.  \n\nTo me IAM works well when RBAC to all data/apps and elevated access is implemented. It is the foundation for IAM and in particular the automation to work well.

When you first join a company, you spend a lot of time learning new systems, new projects come in, you feel like you're contributing and typically you end up learning a whole lot from this. But sometimes as time goes on things get a bit repetitive and projects become less. Sure you end up having a lot of time to self study but generally the best learning comes from exposure to an actual work project that affects the environment you're in and not just a course you take or a small home lab. As someone that dealt with this for a while, it sounds nice to barely have any work but you end up hitting a point where the boredom slowly eats you.",

          "text": "\"A new ClickFix social engineering campaign is targeting the hospitality sector in Europe, using fake Windows Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) screens to trick users into manually compiling and executing malware on their systems.\n\nA BSOD is a Windows crash screen displayed when the operating system encounters a fatal, unrecoverable error that causes it to halt.\n\nIn a new campaign first spotted in December and tracked by researchers at Securonix as \"PHALT#BLYX,\" phishing emails impersonating Booking.com led to a ClickFix social engineering attack that deployed malware.\n\nClickFix social engineering attacks are webpages designed to display an error or issue and then offer \"fixes\" to resolve it. These errors could be fake error messages, security warnings, CAPTCHA challenges, or update notices that instruct visitors to run a command on their computer to fix the issue.\n\nVictims end up infecting their own machines by running malicious PowerShell or shell commands provided in the attacker's instructions.\n\nIn this new ClickFix campaign, attackers send phishing emails that impersonate a hotel guest cancelling their Booking.com reservation, typically sent to a hospitality firm. The claimed refund amount is significant enough to create a sense of urgency for the recipient of the email.\n\nClicking the link in the email takes the victim to a fake Booking.com website hosted on 'low-house[.]com,' which Securonix characterizes as a \"high-fidelity clone\" of the real Booking.com site.\n\n\n\"The page utilizes official Booking.com branding, including the correct color palette, logos, and font styles. To the untrained eye, it is indistinguishable from the legitimate site,\" reports Securonix.\n\nThe site hosts malicious JavaScript that displays a fake \"Loading is taking too long\" error to the target, prompting them to click a button to refresh the page.\n\nHowever, when the target clicks the button, the browser instead enters full-screen mode and displays a fake Windows BSOD crash screen that initiates the ClickFix social engineering attack.\n\nThe screen prompts the person to open the Windows Run dialog box and then press CTRL+V, which pastes a malicious command copied to the Windows clipboard.\n\nThe user is then prompted to press the OK button or Enter on their keyboard to execute the command.\n\nReal BSOD messages do not offer recovery instructions and only display an error code and a reboot notice, but inexperienced users or hospitality staff under pressure to resolve a dispute may overlook these signs of trickery.\n\nPasting the provided command runs a PowerShell command that opens a decoy Booking.com admin page. At the same time, in the background, it downloads a malicious .NET project (v.proj) and compiles it with the legitimate Windows MSBuild.exe compiler.\n\nWhen executed, the payload adds Windows Defender exclusions and triggers UAC prompts to gain admin rights, before it downloads the primary loader using the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) and establishes persistence by dropping a .url file in the Startup folder.\n\nThe malware (staxs.exe) is DCRAT, a remote access Trojan commonly used by threat actors for remote access to infected devices.\n\nThe malware is injected into the legitimate 'aspnet_compiler.exe' process using process hollowing and executed directly in memory.\n\nUpon first contact with the command-and-control (C2) server, the malware sends its full system fingerprint and then waits for commands to execute.\n\nIt supports remote desktop functionality, keylogging, reverse shell, and in-memory execution of additional payloads. In the case observed by Securonix, the attackers dropped a cryptocurrency miner.\n\nWith remote access established, the threat actors now have a foothold on the target's network, allowing them to spread to other devices, steal data, and potentially compromise other systems.\"",

It would require you tricking the Director who hired you (probably >10 years of experience), your Manager (probably >8 years of experience) and all of your peers into hiring you. Then, keeping that lie going for as long as you’re employed. Tricking customers, stakeholders into trusting you and being entrusted with critical systems. \n\nSo, what’s more likely, that you’re cunning enough to fool a team with a combined decades (if not century!) of experience… or that you are competent at your job?

I thought I was fucked, no job car my family hated me all by the age of 25.\n\nThen when I was sacked I tried a level 3 cyber course. Everyone in my class dropped it out it ended up just me and him and I learnt a lot and really enjoyed.\n\nI started Tryhackme, rooms were getting me locked in for hours even on the simplest of rooms. But this was distracting me from my addiction and keeping me occupied.\n\n2 years later I am in a new job as help desk technician. I impressed my work and they have paid for me to do my 4 year cyber degree whilst working. I also got sec+, completed 100rooms and planning on eJPT exam. I Don’t get high no where near as much anymore where as my fix used to be on my mind constantly I now have exploits, latest cyber news and cyber in my head \n\nIf anyone has any advice or tips much appreciated I would say Cyber security saved me!!",
