In managed Windows estates, recovery keys are escrowed to Active Directory or Entra ID for operational resilience, device replacement, and incident response. When keys live there, they are accessible through administrative workflows and, in some cases, lawful process. That isn't a BitLocker backdoor. It's the outcome of how key custody is designed.\n\nThe real question is not whether BitLocker is broken.\n\nIt is who controls recovery key access, under what authority, and with what oversight. \n\nIf an organization centralizes recovery keys, then identity security (the permission to access these keys) becomes part of the encryption boundary. Privileged access controls, role separation, approval workflows, and auditing determine whether those keys are protected or casually exposed.",

There is a reason mailing lists like Full Disclosure existed and people used aliases to dump bugs they found. Eventually, the getting sued mostly stopped but basically your only reward for a long time was receiving credit on the patch announcement, which got street cred. The bug bounty thing came about after a lot of discussion about how to encourage researchers to report bugs responsibly and reward their efforts.\n\nBug bounty programs still pay very poorly relative to their real world value. You'll never see this change. The reality being that (software esp) security as a whole is viewed as a necessary burden, but budgets and timelines never reflect the real risks involved because it's all preventative. This applies to penetration testing / assessment efforts and bounty payouts. Most companies don't invest what they should to really make their products secure.\n\nThis is all compounded by the amount of work these programs require. People report junk bugs that aren't exploitable then start making demands. It's gotten worse with AI, because now they just run AI and report the bug without ever validating it is actually a bug. I saw several in the Linux kernel reported not long ago and ever single one was AI generated, none were real bugs. This creates a lot of work, but it also predates AI when people would run fuzzers and just report stuff without ever testing it. If people stopped reporting low effort crap then maybe these programs could improve as the cost to maintain them went down.",

The other end, though, is what's causing the problem: uber-low-quality irrelevant or false positive bug reports, often directly pipelined from commercial security scanners (sometimes slightly modded) into LLMs and into our inbox, in hopes of collecting bounties, at traffic volumes that end up requiring additional headcounts just to deal with. The stuff that curl has been dealing with isn't just them, it's a plague. \n\nBy offering bounties, what industry hoped to do was give talented security researchers who found flaws an avenue to benefit from their discoveries *without* doing illegal and harmful things. But what has ended up happening is the creation of a perverse incentive system that rewards a different kind of bad actor - the scripted \"bug finder and reporter\" running on a VPS, with a conversion rate somewhere around 0.0001%, generating tens of thousands of wasted work hours per year.\n\nCollecting bug bounties was never meant to be *an industry*.",

The Big 4 and a few other big consulting firms have been this way for my entire career.   \n  \nI've done a fair amount of consulting in my years and have run across this exact scenario many times. I have seen a few examples of those big firms delivering, but those were very specific projects and the work was done primarily by a partner, aka sr. person, in the firm.  If they send you the \"right out of college\" folks, you're gonna see this problem.  IMO you get better services from boutique consulting firms.",

The client had each of the Big 4 doing work for them in one part of their business. Each had an army and after 2 years, none of them had delivered on anything. So the client asked us to get involved. The Big 4 promptly got booted out and we were given the work. We ultimately scrapped everything (cheaper than figuring out how to salvage anything) and we got it all done in about 4 months. Afterwards we were at the corporate office and I joked with senior leadership that we offer cybersecurity janitorial services (we clean up others' messes). They chuckled and then complained about the rates we charged. I just asked them how much did they pay the Big 4 for 2 years with zero projects completed. I followed it up with they should just pay us to do the work going forward as it will be done on-time, on-budget, and done right. (Ah, the joys of youth). That was 13 years ago and the client still puts a significant amount of money in our pocket every single year. There is a significant amount of hard earned trust and respect between us. \n\nTLDR: Our rates may be a bit higher but we deliver.\n\nI do recommend considering boutique firms as you can get exceptional service and a quality product for usually a relatively competitive rate.",

          "text": "Former Big 4 consultant here.\n\nOnce title inflation took off and new grads started earning the title “VP” in some circles, as the overall billable could be increased with minimal affect to bottom-line with the bulk of government work and larger projects, there was a seismic shift away from specialists.\n\nAnyone who was a domain specific SME, backed by an army of grads — began to experience less and less competition for their skills. They acqui-hired local specialists through the boom period, and anyone senior quit to go do the same thing, for better clients/engagements and more money either solo or for boutique’s.\n\nAI then made its way into every level of consulting at Big 4 and now even their audit function is cancerous, we’re just waiting for the eventual radiation to start once they’re found out. It’s happened to a few regional offices, who’ve completely gutted the function and lost hundreds of millions of contracts,m..\n\n.. But yeah, long story short; the big boys got hooked on cheap revenue through title inflation for juniors, created a culture of misrepresentation, which is now being propped up and accelerated by slop.\n\nBoutique, regional and independents are the only way to go now. If your partner is owned by private equity or big 4; run.\n\nMy only recommendation is to ask those in the field near you who they’d hire, and then go with the firm who’s over represented by SME’s in the field you’re hiring. DM if you need Australian recommendations.",

          "text": "My experience of all technical people at Big4 consultancies is that most of them are very average. I work mostly in offensive security, penetration testing, etc. and almost all of the ones I've encountered are woefully sub-par when it comes to technical ability. \n\nThere are of course great people there, but given how many consultants they have it's unsurprising that the average is pretty low.  \n\nI own a offensive security company - and have worked in the industry for \\~20 years, and am from a very technical background (and still even do testing/VR), so feel that I have the ability to judge this pretty well. \n\nHaving said all that, almost all of the people I've met from big4 are very good consultants in general and while technically perhaps aren't super awesome, they really do blend a lot of parts into the package to be just that, consultants. From my friends who have worked at the big consultancy firms, I'm not surprised that all this seems to be the case as their job requirements also often involve soft-selling and other non-technical requirements too.\n\nTake everything I've said with a pinch of salt because I personally haven't worked at a big4.\n\nMy overall recommendation is to go with small-mid sized companies. Independent contractors - especially for penetration testing - are likely not a good idea. Pentesters will often use contractors/associates to do their work and naturally go through a selection process to ensure the standard is up to scratch and that reports/work is QA'd and meeting a particular standard too.\n\nMy general sense is that small-independent companies that have a good reputation are the best companies to go with - ideally before they've been bought out by bigger companies.\n\nAnother thing to note is that smaller/mid-sized companies are often very much more focused on establishing and keeping a good relationship with their clients - big4 can really take or leave any contracts that are not hitting the millions pretty easily and not sweat it too badly.\n\nI don't know if you're specifically talking about pentesting/offensive security stuff - but I guess my experience in this particular area is replicated across others too.\n\nHope this helps.",

They were designing their own best practices or industry standard, most of which was done by graduates with no actual experience. They followed the questions and advice off a form they were told to complete which no knowledge of what to do if it went off script as the questions weren’t updated for a few years.\n\nUnfortunately I had dealt with the organisation so I knew what I was getting into. I then went to another Big 4 and the exact same thing was happening.  Left them and went back to an ops role after 2 years (6 months on the bench due to no work).\n\nOne thing I will say is now I go to smaller consultancies if I want work done, I go to the Big 4 if I want to blame someone for something.

Most have just finished their undergrad degree, more in the accounting side some went straight to a Master's.\n\nI'm fairly certain I remember the titles but I might be off.  They start as associates which do the vast majority of the work, supposedly under the direction of senior associates and managers.  The partners manage the client.  The associates are thrown under the bus and told to go support this client the day they start.  At another company, I worked with someone who had spent years with a Big 4.  He said the second day he was there he was told to fly to a client and one of the other people there would help him learn what he needed to do.\n\nThis model chews through associates at a very high rate of turnover, at most a couple of years.  Then they leave for places with less pressure and just an overall better culture.  \n\nThe ones that stay tend to have the goal of making partner as fast as they can, though a few choose to go down the senior non-partner path for things like director positions.  The main difference is they don't buy into the LLP.",

Is a DBA in IT?  Yes.  Is the VoIP administrator in IT?  Yes.  Do they have much overlap?  No.  They intersect, but don't overlap very much.  The same goes for pen tester, malware engineer, incident responder, and digital forensics engineer.  IT and cybersecurity are incredibly wide fields, and certifications help distinguish a person's experience and skill set in slices of those huge spaces.  Even to the point of this vendor or that one.  An administrator may be responsible for a system that serves thousands of users, and the product has hundreds of developers that have been developing it for 10 years.  It is a huge thing, and something one could build a career around.  A lot of people would have the experience, knowledge, and aptitude to learn to manage it, but someone with a certificate from that vendor, or in that specific role, has evidence that they HAVE learned it, and can be productive very quickly in the role.",

          "text": "I’m not saying certifications are useless. They aren’t. But early in a career, they are often oversold, especially when compared to the long-term value of a solid four-year degree.\n\nI’m a director and manager of a small but highly capable DFIR cyber team that operates as part of a larger cyber organization. I’m directly involved in hiring, mentoring, and developing analysts. What I’m seeing today is very different from what the market looked like even three to five years ago.\n\nThere was a gold rush in cybersecurity. Organizations needed people quickly, and they needed them “good enough” to staff SOCs and respond to alerts. Bootcamps and entry-level certifications filled a real need at the time. They helped people get up to speed on basic tooling and workflows, and for a while that was enough to get hired.\n\nThat phase is over.\n\nThe market has matured. Much of the truly entry-level work has either been offshored, automated, or absorbed by better tooling, better processes, and more efficient teams. What remains are higher-expectation roles that require deeper understanding, better judgment, and the ability to adapt when things do not follow a playbook.\n\nDegrees matter again. Experience matters more. The bar is higher.\n\nWhat I still see, especially on Reddit and similar forums, is people clinging to the gold-rush mentality: get a few certs, land a SOC I role, and get catapulted into a cybersecurity career. That pathway is far less reliable today, and for many people it simply doesn’t work anymore.\n\nCertifications absolutely have a place, but they are not a replacement for a strong foundational education.\n\nA good four-year degree in computer science, computer information systems, or a well-designed cybersecurity program builds something certifications cannot: depth, context, and adaptability. When my team is hiring, I generally prefer candidates with CS or CIS degrees over narrowly focused cyber degrees. Those candidates consistently demonstrate broader technical understanding and stronger problem-solving skills.\n\nCS and CIS graduates tend to understand how systems actually work, not just how to operate tools. They are more comfortable with ambiguity. They reason better when something breaks in a way they haven’t seen before. They can pivot when a tool fails, logs don’t line up, or an incident doesn’t match a textbook scenario.\n\nThat matters in DFIR. It matters in mature cyber environments.\n\nI can teach the cybersecurity specifics, our workflows, our tools, our processes, relatively quickly if the person already has a solid technical foundation. I cannot easily teach systems thinking, troubleshooting intuition, or years of exposure to operating systems, networking, programming concepts, and data structures if those fundamentals were skipped.\n\nThis is where certifications fit best: continuing education.\n\nCerts are excellent for learning specific tools, platforms, or methodologies. They are valuable when someone already understands the underlying technology and has real-world experience to anchor that knowledge. Used that way, they are powerful. Used as a substitute for foundational education, they are fragile.\n\nHome labs, YouTube videos, and self-study are all useful, but they are not the same as being accountable in a real environment, working real incidents, under real constraints, with real consequences. A four-year degree, especially an in-person program done well, exposes students to that rigor over time and forces them to build habits that matter later in their careers.\n\nFaster is not always better.\n\nIf someone is early in their career and serious about cybersecurity as a long-term profession, not just landing their first job, the strongest path is still a solid four-year technical degree, followed by experience, and then certifications layered on top. That combination produces professionals who can grow, adapt, and remain relevant long after the latest tool or cert falls out of favor.\n\nThat’s what mature cyber teams are looking for now.",

I think another important aspect is that having the cert tells people that don't know you what you know. As someone who is new to this, if I see that someone has a high level cert AND relevant experience, that tells me that that's someone probably worth trying to network with and possibly learn something from.\n\nAre certs perfect representations of knowledge and experience?

That is 100% malicious.\n\nTo answer your specific questions: yes, the ~800MB size is actually a massive IOC in itself.\n\nWhat you're seeing is called \"Binary Padding\" or \"File Pumping.\" Malware authors intentionally stuff the binary with hundreds of megabytes of junk data (usually just zeroes) to inflate the file size. They do this because almost all AV/EDR solutions (including Sophos) have a file-size limit for scanning to prevent CPU bottlenecks. If a file is over 500MB, the scanner often just skips it. That’s likely how it got past the initial defense.\n\nregarding the lock/hashing issue:\n\nThe interactions with hmpalert.dll (HitmanPro Alert, which is part of Sophos) suggest Sophos knows it's suspicious but is stuck in a weird state.\n\n• The EDR likely hooked the file or holds a kernel-level handle on it (which is why you can't calculate the hash or check ownership—it's locked by a driver).\n\n• It's basically a standoff: Sophos has it pinned but might be failing to quarantine it because of that massive file size.\n\nHow to unblock yourself:\nSince the OS won't let you touch the file to get a hash:\n\n1. The \"Easy\" Way: Boot into Safe Mode (Networking Disabled). This usually stops the malware and unloads the Sophos drivers locking the file. You should be able to hash or copy it then.\n\n2. The \"Live\" Way: Use a tool that leverages Volume Shadow Copies (like Hobocopy or RawCopy). This lets you copy the file from the shadow volume, bypassing the file lock entirely.\n\nOnce you get that hash, I guarantee it’s going to be a known baddie (or a heavily padded variant of one). Good catch on the \"svhost\" typo!",

Workarounds exist (run on stdio, use IMDSv2).\n\nFull writeup: [https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/microsoft-anthropic-mcp-servers-risk-takeovers](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/microsoft-anthropic-mcp-servers-risk-takeovers)",

          "text": "I only saw one person with what I think is the right answer.\n\nIn my opinion, it would be the Solarwinds attack and here is my rationale.\n\nStuxnet was impressive, but it was a nation state level attack with surgical precision and scope. The one interesting thing about Stuxnet is that due to how sophisticated and how much patience it took at the time, most strategic level systems have adapted several layers of security controls to interrupt an attack like this occuring again.\n\nWannacry was likely the most impactful on a consumer basis and it definitely changed people's perception on how to protect their information.\n\nNotPetya was the most destructive\n\nThe eternalblue exploit that allowed both Wannacry and NotPetya to happen was really just par for course with regards to a big corporation giving a security agency backdoor access to devices. The 2 attacks that happened off the back of it really only served to validate the conspiracy theorists.\n\nBut Solarwinds changed the way security systems had to detect. Up until the solarwinds attack, security had been primarily a signature based detection system, and the only security tools that actually detected something was funky with what was going on with Orion were vendors implementing early heuristics based detection. This also changed the threat vector prioprioritisations worldwide. Realising suddenly that your greatest cybersecurity risk could be your most trusted vendor was a hard pill to swallow for everyone.\n\nThe Solarwinds attack compromised more government systems and critical infrastructure than any other attack, and not in a wanton destruction kinda way like NotPetya did. I believe that because of the solarwinds attack, we're unlikely to see attacks like Stuxnet succeed again, as the higher level attacks that do succeed to find a way in typically opt for a smash and grab style of attack more than any particular goal. This might also be due to advancements in things like bandwidth where prioritising large data sets over strategic targets makes more sense, but either way, Solarwinds attack caused the biggest individual shift in cybersecurity out of the big ones.",

Back in 2023, they had a massive data leak, which exposed really sensitive information. When they were investigated, they found records of Optus investing their funds into more bullshit rather than investing in their cybersecurity infrastructure, which pressured the CEO to step down. Optus was one of the main examples that brought in new cybersecurity laws regarding company negligence. Later last year, 3 emergency service outages happened, where Optus was the main company contracted by the government to maintain emergency service calls. This time it wasn't a cyberattack, but just pure negligence just like what happened back in 2023. Two of the main Optus executives resigned after this lmao. After this, new laws were also introduced that forced all telecommunications providers to have a supervisory firm to check if everything is up to date, and finding if certain systems meet certain criteria.",
