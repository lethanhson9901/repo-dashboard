It's less of an issue if the AI breaks something, as long as it can detect that it has done so and restore things to how they were before a human has had time to react.

Kiro had operator-level permissions, no mandatory peer review, and no enforcement boundary between \"I am authorized to be here\" and \"I am authorized to do this.\" Those are two completely different things and almost nobody is treating them differently yet.​\n\nAmazon called it user error. Technically they are right. But \"user error\" in an agentic world is a policy failure, not a human failure. The human made a mistake with permissions once. The agent executed that mistake at machine speed, without hesitation, without a second thought, across a production environment. Thirteen hours.\n\nI built [MarkdownLM](https://markdownlm.com/) specifically for this gap. Not at the permissions layer, IAM and least-privilege are your infrastructure team's job. But at the policy layer, the layer that says \"even if you are authorized to touch this, here are the rules for how you touch it, and here is the gate that validates your output before it executes.\" That layer does not exist in most teams' workflows right now. The Kiro incident is what happens when it does not.",

Read-only actions go through. Anything that changes state has to present evidence first (dry-run/diff) and stay within a bounded scope. Truly destructive operations are blocked by default unless there’s explicit, time-limited approval.

I appreciate the fast follow up.\n\nThe one (lengthy) thing I’ll say about the conflict of interest issue is that while there may not be a conflict (and there doesn’t appear to be one in this case), the audience cannot and should not assume that there isn’t one, especially given the nature of Barrack AI’s business.\n\nIf a pharmaceutical company put out a white paper warning of the ills of a drug offered by competitors and every statement was factual, you’d be at least a bit skeptical even if the white paper didn’t mention the company’s competing product and it was co-written with an independent researcher. Why? Because the company funding the white paper stands to benefit in some way such as a better reputation or monetarily.\n\nAt best, we hope that you are an honest broker leveraging your expertise to help laypeople understand the import of the issues you’re raising. There is a place for customer education and it often does come from vendors, but readers like the ones that frequent this subreddit have to maintain that skepticism to be good stewards of the policies, tools, and practices at their own organization.\n\nWhile, I don’t believe Barrack AI is attempting to scam readers or falsely accuse any one of wrongdoing, we must remain vigilant that other less scrupulous actors will.",

Not great, but ok.\n\nPassword field contains asterisks.

It's not always actually a security concern, but at least then we can explain why it isn't.  I can't speak for TP-Link, but they _should_ appreciate it as well. It's better to have people bring it to you than spread it around. \n\nAnd as a TP-Link customer, I would love for them to get it right. They should never store a password, ever. Only hashes of passwords. \n\nOn this page there is a paragraph with the heading \"Engagement with the security community\" which has an email address you can raise your concerns to. They may say you had credentials so it's not a security issue (it is though), or they may release a fix for it.\n\nhttps://www.tp-link.com/us/landing/security-commitment/",

Many of us who operate regulated environments appreciate the early disclosures we often get from each other in IRC, Discord, various subreddits, etc... and I've often been made aware of and acted on issues *long* before vendors acknowledged/fixed those issues in the past.\n\nI know it's a potential black eye for the vendor, but for my admin team and cybersecurity, we've been glad to have been made aware in advance so we can take action early.

Cisco for example has an additional config line to enable storing passwords in an encrypted fashion, but that would imply it can also be decrypted again rather than it being a hashed password that you can't get back, and also that it is not even the default.\n\nOn most network gear in businesses you should just be disabling the password logon and managing the devices with ssh keys or a radius server with some kind of federated auth.",

It is starting to change in recent years to some more common good practice things (new versions of Cisco switches will have MD5 hashing enabled for the password, old versions defaulted to plain text with the option to enable it).\n\nI am struggling to find information about why this is but I suspect its a \"if the attacker can get this config you are already screwed\" so they dont stand to gain much from a single network device password. Enterprise firewalls are all a bit better than switches for security as they were always perimeter devices and therefore part of the keep keeping attackers out of the network to begin with.\n\nRegardless with or without a password, physical access makes it incredibly easy for anyone to walk in, wipe and reconfigure network equipment to their own gain as all of these devices have some way to wipe them without a password, or in some older cases just remove the password from the config entirely to gain unauthed access.",

No breach. No hack. The integrations just worked exactly as built.\n\nUsers handed over government IDs to prove they were old enough to use a chat app. Three vendors down the chain, that data ended up somewhere they never agreed to.\n\nAnd this is the part that gets me. We dump money into firewalls, EDR, SIEM. All of it pointed at the front door. But this vendor had legitimate access. The data moved through approved integrations. Nothing flagged because nothing broke.\n\nI keep thinking about this: most teams I know can't tell you what their users did in the browser yesterday. Which apps they logged into. Where files went. Not because they're bad at their jobs. The tooling was never built to look there.\n\nFirewalls see the network. EDR sees the endpoint. The browser is where work actually happens and most orgs have nothing watching it. AND honestly I'd bet most companies have no idea what theirs is doing either.",

Same code, same data, now on a sheet of paper. When asked why, the explanation is \"Chinese hackers.\" A consultancy warned them. So the defensive move is to downgrade a digital system into a 1998 office workflow and pretend this is cybersecurity.\n\nGo to China and you cannot move without a QR code. Transport, payments, buildings, government services. No paper, no drama, no pretending scanners can tell the difference between a phone screen and a printer. It works because the system is designed for reality, not fear. Imagine trying to implement that here. They’d commission a consultancy. The consultancy would recommend buying 50,000 printers. Every airport, every port of entry, every office stacked with paper so officials can \"securely\" scan digital codes off dead trees. This is how Britain is broken.",

Every age verification system that actually works requires collecting sensitive biometric or identity data, which creates exactly the kind of high-value target that cybersecurity teams spend their careers trying to minimize.\n\nFrom a governance perspective, Discord's mistake was deploying before answering the basic questions: Where does the verification data sit? Who has access? What's the retention policy? What happens when (not if) it gets breached? The fact that they're \"pausing\" suggests they didn't have good answers.\n\nThe broader problem is there's no industry standard for privacy-preserving age verification. Everyone's rolling their own implementation, which means everyone's making their own mistakes. This is exactly the kind of problem that needs a regulatory framework rather than letting each platform experiment on their users.\n",

Good.  \n  \ntbh I kinda respect Stanislav for just admitting they screwed up instead of doubling down, but the real issue isn't execution — it's that age verification as currently imagined is fundamentally broken. Every solution I've seen basically amounts to \"build a database of minors' personal information\" which is... not great.  \n  \nThe whole controversy happened because users correctly identified that uploading government IDs to chat on Discord is insane. They're not wrong! But Discord also can't just ignore COPPA and international regulations.  \n  \nWhat's wild to me is that we have all this sophisticated tech and the best approach anyone can come up with is still \"show us your papers.\" There are def better ways to prove age without collecting PII, but the industry is stuck in this 2015 mindset where verification = document upload.",

          "text": "\"Two former Google engineers and a third alleged accomplice are facing federal charges after prosecutors accused them of swiping sensitive chip and security technology secrets and then trying to cover their tracks when the scheme began to unravel.\n\nAccording to the Department of Justice, sisters Samaneh and Soroor Ghandali, both former Google employees, along with Mohammadjavad Khosravi, who worked at another unnamed technology company, have been charged with conspiracy, theft of trade secrets, and obstruction of justice.\n\nThe indictment alleges the trio misappropriated confidential information from multiple firms, including Google, spanning processor security and cryptography technologies, and that some of the data was exfiltrated to unauthorized locations, including Iran.\n\nThe DOJ says that while working at Google, Samaneh Ghandali allegedly transferred hundreds of internal files, including trade secrets, to a third-party communications platform and shared them in channels associated with the defendants. Soroor Ghandali is accused of transferring numerous files as well, with prosecutors claiming the data later turned up on personal devices and other systems connected to the group.\n\nAuthorities say the alleged scheme went beyond simple downloads, with steps taken to hide the activity, including destroying records, submitting false statements, and even photographing screens rather than moving documents directly.\n\nKhosravi, who is married to Samaneh Ghandali, is accused of coordinating with the sisters and accessing sensitive information through his own unnamed employer.\n\nA spokesperson at Google told The Register:.\n\n\"We have enhanced safeguards to protect our confidential information and immediately alerted law enforcement after discovering this incident. Today's indictments are an important step towards accountability and we'll continue working to ensure our trade secrets remain secure.\"\n\nLaw enforcement officials were keen to frame the case as more than just an internal corporate spat. \"The alleged actions outlined in this indictment reflect a calculated betrayal of trust by individuals accused of stealing trade secrets from the very tech companies that employed them. According to the allegations, the method in which confidential data was transferred by the defendants involved deliberate steps to evade detection and conceal their identities,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani.\n\n\"Protecting Silicon Valley innovation and defending the groundbreaking technologies that drive our economy and national security is a top priority for the FBI. We will continue to work with our private sector partners to hold accountable anyone who seeks to unlawfully exploit American ingenuity,\" he added.\"",

According to researcher “Celeste” the exposed code, which has now been removed, sat at a US government-authorized endpoint that appears to have been isolated from its regular work environment.\n\n> In those files, the researchers found details about the extensive surveillance Persona software performs on its users. Beyond checking their age, the software performs 269 distinct verification checks, runs facial recognition against watchlists and politically exposed persons, screens “adverse media” across 14 categories (including terrorism and espionage), and assigns risk and similarity scores.\n\n> Persona collects—and can retain for up to three years—IP addresses, browser and device fingerprints, government ID numbers, phone numbers, names, faces, plus a battery of “selfie” analytics like suspicious-entity detection, pose repeat detection, and age inconsistency checks.\n\nInformation leakage aside, it is depressing to see countries barrel towards China's mandatory identity link with online accounts.\n\nI had a friend back in college who said one of their friends in the PRC once criticized a local government official on social media. Police showed up at his doorstep the next day and took him away for several days of interrogation.",

It might not even be outright dismantling freedom of speech (or other rights), all it takes is spreading enough worries for people to self-censor and avoid discussing day-to-day societal issues.\n\nTime and time again we see examples of data breaches or badly built infrastructure, which means no single entity can be trusted to keep data safe, to not exploit the data, to not have bad actors access it, to not result in future harm.\n\nIt might be low risk to share your personal opinion today. In 10 years, someone might track you down because of that and drag you in front of a court. \n\nIt's never about today, it's about tomorrow. It's not about \"what if\", it's about \"when\".\n\nDiscord especially is very popular among various political groups and social movements. Not all of them are pedophiles or neo-nazis, I would even argue the vast majority are left leaning groups. \n\nBest worst case would be people being targeted for their political opinions in the near future, as governments turn their agencies into vindictive oppressive tools. Worst worst case would be people being executed.\n\nSociety is way too naive imho. Which is why we can't back down and allow such developments to happen and infiltrate our lives continuously. \n\nEven if there is a slight chance to improve and save lives thanks to complete surveillance, the sacrifice are still immense. So many innocent people are currently and will suffer just because the wrong people are in positions of power and are using every possibility to silence and dispose of anyone who isn't supporting human rights violations.\n\nWe are absolutely setting up a dystopian future if we continue down this path and there will be few options left to fight it, the more ground is lost.",

If you are using tryhackme to learn and using its training modules then calling it a game is intentionally misleading the intent in an effort to diminish its usefulness.\n\nIf a capture the flag is a game then all training material for any advanced penetration testing curriculum is a “game”.\n\nIs it gamified? Yes. So is your daily Apple fitness goals. Does that mean that fitness is a game?",

I mean, once someone's inside the organization, especially with developer access, they can sit quietly and siphon off data or embed malicious code. And background check systems, as you've pointed out, just aren't equipped for that level of deception, especially when it involves state resources.\n\n  \nWhat really gets me is how this changes the game for internal security controls. We're talking about not just perimeter defenses or endpoint protection but also in-depth monitoring of code changes and anomalous behavior in repositories. It's a real race to stay ahead, and honestly, it's a bit terrifying how human factors have become such a big part of cyber threats now.",

(Over 20 years) Working at companies that you all know very well. \n\n\nAs I approach 50, I don't see myself sustaining at the tip for much longer. I want to avoid management like the plague, and stay an IC for as long as I can...\n\n\nUp until about 6 months ago, GRC felt like a comfortable place to land. Being on the highly technical side - I figured that would put me in a good position in GRC, but with the advent of this AI stuff and seeing what agentic AI can do and crunch through your infra config and codebases with MCP Servers feeding all the relevant data into nicely formatted documents - I just don't know what future GRC has. Sure AI doesn't fully understand risk, sure AI doesn't fully understand context... But if it can augment a team of two GRC people to do the work of 10 GRC people, previously... Then even in that case, there will be so fewer jobs out there.\n\n\nBut it's only a short matter of time (IMO) before it can do the job as well as I can. \n\n\nSo I have no idea where that's going to leave me. AI has put a wrench in an otherwise well thought out, smooth transition plan, and I don't feel comfortable telling anyone where I'll be in 3 years nevermind 5 years from now. Mostly because I feel a lot of jobs are simply going to go away. I use opus 4.6, I create my agents and other configurations and it's augmenting and accelerating my work like never before.\n\n\nBut business is business. And when money can be saved... And board members demand profit in the name of 'good' not getting in the way of 'perfect' I just don't know where things are going to land, long term, for us cyber folks. ",

Who will quite probably still have minimal idea of what they’re doing, but could leverage a sufficiently unrestricted AI to generate malicious code. They’re still unlikely to pose an enormous threat, but they could definitely do more damage. \n\nThe real problem is capable hackers who get access to AIs which are capable & unrestricted. Although AV software is getting much more capable with dynamic analysis, the fundamental structure of AVs is built off years worth of IoC data. A capable AI could pretty much replicate malicious code with slight tweaks, to avoid the static detections/weak dynamic detections. Or worse, a capable AI will no doubt eventually be able to create new variants of malicious code, or automate attacks in ways defenders aren’t prepared for.",

Your report seems awfully light on evidence, and the commands you provided in the steps to reproduce the exploit contain the wrong flags for what you claim you did. Not to mention the “server” with exposed directory you found? Yeah that’s a Lambda function bud, you didn’t find any exposed directories…what you found were health check routes. Of course they returned a HTTP 200 when you queried them. They expose private information? The number 1 (for: all checks returned successfully on the backend) is private information? To whom? \n\nAnyway. Client sees this report. The client is panicked. My superiors are panicked.

      "text": "I’m seeing a lot of “AppSec is automated, cybersecurity is over” takes after Anthropic’s announcement. I tried to put a more grounded perspective into a post and I’m curious if folks here agree/disagree.\n\nI’ve spent 10+ years testing complex, distributed systems across orgs. Systems so large that nobody has a full mental model of the whole thing. One thing that experience keeps teaching me: the scariest issues usually aren’t “bad code.” They’re broken assumptions between components.\n\nI like to think about this as a **“map vs territory”** problem.\n\nThe **map** is the repo: source code, static analysis, dependency graphs, PR review, scanners (even very smart ones). The map can be incredibly detailed and still miss what matters.\n\nThe **territory** is the running system: identity providers, gateways, service-to-service auth, caches, queues, config, feature flags, deployment quirks, operational defaults, and all the little “temporary” exceptions that become permanent over time.\n\nClaude Code Security (and tools like it) is real progress for the map. It can raise the baseline and catch a lot of bugs earlier. That’s a win.\n\nBut a lot of the incidents that actually hurt don’t show up as “here’s a vulnerable line of code.” They look like:\n\n* a token meaning one thing at the edge and something else three hops later\n* “internal” trust assumptions that stop being internal\n* a legacy endpoint that bypasses the modern permission model\n* config drift that turns a safe default into a footgun\n* runtime edge cases that only appear under real traffic / concurrency\n\nIn other words: **correct local behavior + broken global assumptions**.\n\nThat’s why I don’t think “cybersecurity is over.” I think it’s shifting. As code scanning gets cheaper and better, the differentiator moves toward systems security: trust boundaries, blast radius reduction, detection/response, and designing so failures are containable.\n\nI wrote a longer essay with more detail/examples here (if you're interested in this subject): [https://uphack.io/blog/post/security-is-not-a-code-problem/](https://uphack.io/blog/post/security-is-not-a-code-problem/)",

Now and even more so in the future we will just build software tailored exactly to our business. \n\nI am seeing really well built full stack applications being built from a dataset and a prompt. The prompts aren’t amazing either here. Things like, “Help me visualize this data.”  “Help me build a marketing campaign.”  Sure it will take a while to become the norm and thus seems very odd now but it’s a train that isn’t slowing down, keeps learning, and never sleeps. The business users have no idea the power that this will bring yet. \n\nI am already hearing talk of teams of agents. Agents spinning up more ephemeral agents to do tasks. It’s going to get wild. \n\nLook at openClaw. It’s a really good study because ofc it’s public facing and so people are going to hammer it with malware, prompt injections, etc, and try to exploit it. But what about something like that internally? What about that combined with other agents that can’t change anything but monitor and raise issues with other agents? There are ways to control these things. Companies will find a way and this will take off because it’s massive cost savings.\n\nFor security software this is huge because they can’t write some shitty code that hits obvious api and presents it in a pretty way to make more money. CTOs are going to crack down on anything SaaS unless the vendors pricing comes way down which likely just can’t happen based on capitalism and the need for ever expanding profits.",
