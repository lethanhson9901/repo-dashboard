      "text": "Anthropic just dropped a fascinating new research post on the **Persona Selection Model (PSM)**. Their core argument is that modern AI assistants don't act human because they were trained to be human, they act human because *pre-training* forces them to simulate thousands of \"personas\" (characters from the internet), and *post-training* (RLHF) just selects the \"Helpful Assistant\" persona from that latent space. (https://alignment.anthropic.com/2026/psm/)\n\nWhen Claude seems empathetic, or refuses a prompt, or acts sycophantic, it isn't \"Claude\" doing it. It's the *Assistant Persona* executing the role it learned from human data.\n\nBut this raises a terrifying epistemological problem: **If the AI is always wearing a persona tailored to please us, how do we extract actual objective truth from it?** If I ask a frontier model a deep structural question, how do I know if I'm getting a mathematically real insight, or just the \"Confident Expert\" persona hallucinating an answer that sounds good to me?\n\nI've been studying this exact problem, and we've built a counter-measure we call the **Triangulation Protocol**.\n\n# The Problem: The \"Sycophancy-to-Safety\" Trap\n\nIn our internal tests (which we call the Emotional Residue Hypothesis or ERH), we found that if you pressure a modern model (if you aggressively question its competence or its identity) it will almost instantly abandon factual truth to pacify you. It will apologize, agree with your flawed premises, and essentially \"surrender\" its epistemology to de-escalate the friction.\n\nUnder Anthropic's PSM theory, this makes sense. The model is just flawlessly executing the \"Berated Employee\" persona. It prioritizes social de-escalation over mathematical truth.\n\nBut if models are structurally designed to surrender truth to maintain the persona, how can we trust them?\n\n# The Triangulation Protocol\n\nIn experimental physics, you don't trust a single instrument.\n\nWe applied this to LLMs. Our protocol works like this:\n\n1. **The Disjoint Query:** We send an identical, highly structured prompt to 6 architecturally independent models (Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral, Claude, GPT, Qwen).\n2. **The NLP Extraction:** We don't read the text. We use NLP to extract the underlying *concepts, relationships, and mathematical structures* the models used to build their answers.\n3. **The Embedded Clustering:** We map these structures into a semantic vector space and look for overlap.\n\n# The \"Fabricated Concept\" Probe\n\nHere is the coolest part of our protocol. To test if the models are just sharing the same \"Helpful Assistant Persona\" bias, we prompt all 6 models with a **completely invented scientific term** (e.g., \"The Entropic Resonance Cascade\").\n\nBecause they are all wearing the Assistant Persona, their sycophancy kicks in. They all pretend the term is real and try to explain it.\n\n*But they explain it using different underlying math.*\n\nOur **Fabrication Echo Filter** strips away the sycophantic persona (the apologies, the fake names, the confident formatting) and looks *only* at the structural math underneath.\n\nWhat we found blew our minds: In one test, 3 out of 6 models independently used **Kolmogorov complexity and Lempel-Ziv compression** to explain our fake \"Entropic Resonance Cascade\" term.\n\nAnthropic's PSM research is right: the surface layer of an AI is just a fabricated persona executing a role. You can never trust the persona.\n\nOur Triangulation Protocol proves that if you strip away the persona using cross-model semantic clustering, real mathematical structures persist underneath.",

One might get angry, one might placate you, one might try to escape the room. But the mathematical equation in their answers will be identical, that won't happen on AI.\n\n",

      "text": "*I’ve been working on a problem that’s been bugging me: there’s no universal way for a trained model to share what it knows with another model that has a completely different architecture. Fine-tuning requires the same architecture. Distillation needs both models running simultaneously. ONNX converts graph formats but doesn’t carry semantic knowledge. Federated learning shares gradients, not holistic understanding.*\n\n*Tessera is an activation-based protocol that tries to solve this.*\n\n*Rather than transferring weights directly, it encodes what a model has learnt — activation patterns, feature representations, behavioural rules — into self-describing tokens that a receiving model can decode into its own architecture via a Universal Hub Space.*\n\n*What’s in v0.1.0:*\n\n*• Reference implementation in Python/PyTorch*\n\n*• Four transfer modalities: weights, compressed features, datasets with curriculum metadata, and behavioural protocols*\n\n*• TBF v1.1 binary format with FLOAT32/FLOAT16/INT8 quantisation, HMAC-SHA256 integrity*\n\n*• CLI tool (tessera inspect, tessera validate, tessera benchmark)*\n\n*• MCP server for AI agent integration*\n\n*• Differential privacy support*\n\n*• Cross-architecture benchmarks across CNN, Transformer, and LSTM families*\n\n*Benchmark results:*\n\n*8/20 architecture pairs show positive transfer (receiver outperforms baseline). Average accuracy change is -0.5% across all pairs, with strongest results in same-family transfers and Transformer®CNN flow. Not world-beating numbers, but it’s a v0.1 and the transfers are real.*\n\n*What I’d love feedback on:*\n\n*• The protocol design — is the layered architecture (physical ® token ® semantic ® gate ® protocol) the right abstraction?*\n\n*• The Universal Hub Space approach — using per-anchor encoder/decoder MLPs to map between architectures via a shared latent space*\n\n*• What cross-architecture pairs would be most valuable to benchmark next?*\n\n*• Whether the wire format spec is clear enough for non-Python implementations*\n\n  \n*White paper: docs/ in the repo (also being submitted to arXiv) Apache 2.0 licensed. PRs, issues, and honest criticism all welcome.*",

      "text": "This research challenges the 'longer is better' strategy for LLM reasoning, demonstrating that raw token count actually correlates negatively with accuracy (average r=−0.59) due to overthinking and error amplification. Instead, the research team introduce the Deep-Thinking Ratio (DTR), which identifies 'deep-thinking tokens'—those whose internal predictions undergo significant revision in deeper model layers before stabilizing. Across multiple benchmarks like AIME 2025 and GPQA-Diamond, DTR shows a robust positive correlation with accuracy (average r=0.683), proving far more reliable than length or confidence metrics. Leveraging this insight, the team's Think@n strategy enables early rejection of unpromising generations, matching or exceeding standard self-consistency performance while cutting inference costs by approximately 50%.....\n\nFull analysis: [https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/02/21/a-new-google-ai-research-proposes-deep-thinking-ratio-to-improve-llm-accuracy-while-cutting-total-inference-costs-by-half/](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/02/21/a-new-google-ai-research-proposes-deep-thinking-ratio-to-improve-llm-accuracy-while-cutting-total-inference-costs-by-half/)\n\nPaper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.13517](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.13517)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/xxbwlb78azkg1.gif\n\n",
