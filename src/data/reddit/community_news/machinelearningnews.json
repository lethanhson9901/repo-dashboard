Locally correct components composing into globally suboptimal results is basically the same failure mode we've been fighting with multi-agent development.

That gap between microbenchmark wins (5-6x) and end-to-end regression (1.7-6.2x slower) feels like it points to an orchestration problem more than a model capability problem.",

              "text": "It really depends on your use case.\n\n* If you want **faithful, terminology-consistent “just translate”** output (especially on **edge devices**), **encoder–decoder MT** like Marian is usually still the best choice: more deterministic and typically **cheaper/faster** than LLMs for pure translation.\n* LLM translation often shines when you want **extra behavior** (tone polishing, rewriting, localization, grammar cleanup), but it can **paraphrase** or drift on names/terms unless heavily constrained.\n\nFor edge-friendly alternatives to benchmark, I’d look at:\n\n* **NLLB-200 distilled (600M)**\n* **M2M100 (418M)**\n* **TranslateGemma (4B)** if your hardware/quantization budget allows And for speed on CPU/edge, consider running them via **CTranslate2**.",
