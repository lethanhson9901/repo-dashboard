      "text": "Built a reservoir computing system (Liquid State Machine) as a learning experiment. Instead of a standard static reservoir, I added biological simulation layers on top to see how constraints affect behavior.\n\nWhat it actually does (no BS):\n\n\\- LSM with 2000+ reservoir neurons, Numba JIT-accelerated\n\n\\- Hebbian + STDP plasticity (the reservoir rewires during runtime)\n\n\\- Neurogenesis/atrophy  reservoir can grow or shrink neurons dynamically\n\n\\- A hormone system (3 floats: dopamine, cortisol, oxytocin) that modulates learning rate,   reflex sensitivity, and noise injection\n\n\\- Pain : gaussian noise injected into reservoir state, degrades performance\n\n\\- Differential retina (screen capture → |frame(t) - frame(t-1)|) as input\n\n\\- Ridge regression readout layer, trained online\n\n\n\nWhat it does NOT do:\n\n\\- It's NOT a general intelligence but you should integrate LLM in future (LSM as main brain  and LLM as second brain)\n\n\\- The \"personality\" and \"emotions\" are parameter modulation, not emergent\n\nWhy I built it:\n\nwanted to explore whether adding biological constraints (fatigue, pain,hormone cycles) to a reservoir computer creates interesting dynamics vs a vanilla LSM. It does the system genuinely behaves differently based on its \"state.\" Whether that's useful is debatable.\n\n14 Python modules, \\~8000 lines, runs fully local (no APIs).\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/JeevanJoshi2061/Project-Genesis-LSM.git](https://github.com/JeevanJoshi2061/Project-Genesis-LSM.git)\n\nCurious if anyone has done similar work with constrained reservoir computing or bio-inspired dynamics.",
