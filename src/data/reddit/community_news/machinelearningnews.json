The objective is to have stable components with futuristic roadmaps and, at the same time, comply with security and data protection.\n\nFor eg - my team will be deciding how to roll out MCP at enterprise level, how to enable RAG, which vector databases to be used, what kind of developer platform and guardrails to be deployed for model development etc etc.\n\ncan anyone who is working with such big enterprises or have experience working with them share some insights here? What is the ecosystem you see in these organizations - from model development, agentic development to their production grade deployments.\n\nwe already started engaging with Microsoft and Google since we understood several components can be just provisioned with cloud.
