I really appreciate a developer of your caliber taking the time to look through my repo.\n\nYou're absolutely right about the description. I started Verantyx as a pure symbolic (LLM-free) project, but the jump to 84.0% was indeed achieved through a hybrid approach with Claude 4.5 Sonnet. I’ve just updated the repo description and README to reflect this clearly and avoid any 'clickbait' feel.\n\nI also cleaned up the HLE references to keep the focus on ARC-AGI-2.

              "text": "That is a very sharp observation, but I believe we are comparing two fundamentally different \"game rules\" here. I appreciate the chance to clarify why the **Generalization Gap** might look wider than it actually is.\n\nHere is the breakdown of why the Verantyx results on Training sets and the current \"Evaluation\" baselines aren't an apples-to-apples comparison:\n\n# 1. Direct Prediction vs. Universal Synthesis\n\nThe \\~45% score on the leaderboard for vanilla Sonnet often comes from **direct grid prediction** (the model guesses the pixel values).\n\n* **The Leaderboard:** If the model gets the pixels right in 1 out of 3 attempts, it’s a win. This is an \"intuition\" test.\n* **Verantyx:** My system requires the LLM to write a **general-purpose Python function** that must be pixel-perfect against *all* training examples and the test input. Writing valid, executable code that generalizes across multiple grids is an order of magnitude harder than guessing a single grid. One single character error or a 1-pixel shift results in a \"FAIL.\"\n\n# 2. Analysis of the 417 \"FAIL\" cases\n\nI’ve started auditing the failures, and the majority aren't \"near misses\"—they are **systemic integration errors**:\n\n* **Numpy \"Hallucination\":** Out of 668 generated files, **287 used** `numpy` despite explicit prompt instructions to avoid it.\n* **Type Mismatch:** While my `verify_synth.py` supports numpy, it often failed because it was trying to compare a `numpy.ndarray` output to a standard Python `list`.\n* **Conclusion:** A huge chunk of the \"Generalization Gap\" here is actually a \"Formatting Gap.\" The model has the reasoning to solve the task but fails on the implementation constraints.\n\n# 3. Search Budget and \"Adaptive Thinking\"\n\nFrontier models like Sonnet 4.5/4.6 on the leaderboard likely benefit from **extensive internal iterative refinement**(what Anthropic calls \"Adaptive Thinking\"). They might \"think\" for thousands of tokens per task.\n\n* My current benchmark was a **\"naive\" run**: strictly 3 attempts per task, \"write once and move on.\" No feedback loops, no error correction.\n\n# 4. Financial & Resource Constraints\n\nTo be completely transparent: as a student, **I currently lack the financial resources** to pay for the massive API costs required to re-run these evaluations with higher search budgets, error-correction loops, or more expensive models (like Opus).\n\nVerantyx is designed to be a **Neurosymbolic Harness** that compensates for these gaps. Once I can secure the necessary compute/API budget, I am confident that fixing the \"formatting\" issues and allowing for iterative refinement will close this gap significantly.\n\nFor now, I'm focusing on what I can do for free: optimizing the **Stage 1 symbolic library** to better guide the LLM's \"code-search\" so it doesn't need to rely on expensive brute-force guessing.",

      "text": "Anthropic just dropped a fascinating new research post on the **Persona Selection Model (PSM)**. Their core argument is that modern AI assistants don't act human because they were trained to be human, they act human because *pre-training* forces them to simulate thousands of \"personas\" (characters from the internet), and *post-training* (RLHF) just selects the \"Helpful Assistant\" persona from that latent space. (https://alignment.anthropic.com/2026/psm/)\n\nWhen Claude seems empathetic, or refuses a prompt, or acts sycophantic, it isn't \"Claude\" doing it. It's the *Assistant Persona* executing the role it learned from human data.\n\nBut this raises a terrifying epistemological problem: **If the AI is always wearing a persona tailored to please us, how do we extract actual objective truth from it?** If I ask a frontier model a deep structural question, how do I know if I'm getting a mathematically real insight, or just the \"Confident Expert\" persona hallucinating an answer that sounds good to me?\n\nI've been studying this exact problem, and we've built a counter-measure we call the **Triangulation Protocol**.\n\n# The Problem: The \"Sycophancy-to-Safety\" Trap\n\nIn our internal tests (which we call the Emotional Residue Hypothesis or ERH), we found that if you pressure a modern model (if you aggressively question its competence or its identity) it will almost instantly abandon factual truth to pacify you. It will apologize, agree with your flawed premises, and essentially \"surrender\" its epistemology to de-escalate the friction.\n\nUnder Anthropic's PSM theory, this makes sense. The model is just flawlessly executing the \"Berated Employee\" persona. It prioritizes social de-escalation over mathematical truth.\n\nBut if models are structurally designed to surrender truth to maintain the persona, how can we trust them?\n\n# The Triangulation Protocol\n\nIn experimental physics, you don't trust a single instrument.\n\nWe applied this to LLMs. Our protocol works like this:\n\n1. **The Disjoint Query:** We send an identical, highly structured prompt to 6 architecturally independent models (Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral, Claude, GPT, Qwen).\n2. **The NLP Extraction:** We don't read the text. We use NLP to extract the underlying *concepts, relationships, and mathematical structures* the models used to build their answers.\n3. **The Embedded Clustering:** We map these structures into a semantic vector space and look for overlap.\n\n# The \"Fabricated Concept\" Probe\n\nHere is the coolest part of our protocol. To test if the models are just sharing the same \"Helpful Assistant Persona\" bias, we prompt all 6 models with a **completely invented scientific term** (e.g., \"The Entropic Resonance Cascade\").\n\nBecause they are all wearing the Assistant Persona, their sycophancy kicks in. They all pretend the term is real and try to explain it.\n\n*But they explain it using different underlying math.*\n\nOur **Fabrication Echo Filter** strips away the sycophantic persona (the apologies, the fake names, the confident formatting) and looks *only* at the structural math underneath.\n\nWhat we found blew our minds: In one test, 3 out of 6 models independently used **Kolmogorov complexity and Lempel-Ziv compression** to explain our fake \"Entropic Resonance Cascade\" term.\n\nAnthropic's PSM research is right: the surface layer of an AI is just a fabricated persona executing a role. You can never trust the persona.\n\nOur Triangulation Protocol proves that if you strip away the persona using cross-model semantic clustering, real mathematical structures persist underneath.",

Fine-tuning requires the same architecture. Distillation needs both models running simultaneously. ONNX converts graph formats but doesn’t carry semantic knowledge. Federated learning shares gradients, not holistic understanding.*\n\n*Tessera is an activation-based protocol that tries to solve this.*\n\n*Rather than transferring weights directly, it encodes what a model has learnt — activation patterns, feature representations, behavioural rules — into self-describing tokens that a receiving model can decode into its own architecture via a Universal Hub Space.*\n\n*What’s in v0.1.0:*\n\n*• Reference implementation in Python/PyTorch*\n\n*• Four transfer modalities: weights, compressed features, datasets with curriculum metadata, and behavioural protocols*\n\n*• TBF v1.1 binary format with FLOAT32/FLOAT16/INT8 quantisation, HMAC-SHA256 integrity*\n\n*• CLI tool (tessera inspect, tessera validate, tessera benchmark)*\n\n*• MCP server for AI agent integration*\n\n*• Differential privacy support*\n\n*• Cross-architecture benchmarks across CNN, Transformer, and LSTM families*\n\n*Benchmark results:*\n\n*8/20 architecture pairs show positive transfer (receiver outperforms baseline). Average accuracy change is -0.5% across all pairs, with strongest results in same-family transfers and Transformer®CNN flow. Not world-beating numbers, but it’s a v0.1 and the transfers are real.*\n\n*What I’d love feedback on:*\n\n*• The protocol design — is the layered architecture (physical ® token ® semantic ® gate ® protocol) the right abstraction?*\n\n*• The Universal Hub Space approach — using per-anchor encoder/decoder MLPs to map between architectures via a shared latent space*\n\n*• What cross-architecture pairs would be most valuable to benchmark next?*\n\n*• Whether the wire format spec is clear enough for non-Python implementations*\n\n  \n*White paper: docs/ in the repo (also being submitted to arXiv) Apache 2.0 licensed.

      "text": "Hey, Im a relative newcomer to the world of AI. Ive been coding for around 4 / 5 years and I read a lot of ML papers. I read like a paper a day in the computing / ML space. \n\nRight now my main pet topics are ( meta ) association rules, hypernetworks, meta learning, logical graphs and sometimes hyperbolic neural nets.\n\nIm aware that a lot of papers are bullshit, that simply adding more computations will result in SOMETHING being achieved regardless of the model architecture. Ive also been told that many architectures can perform well on singular tasks but dont scale, though the context as to why is often missing.\n\nCan anyone with more knowledge explain why most of the industry seems focused on LLMs or neural nets in general instead of exotic architectures like logic-graph-hypernetworks? Is it just that my feed is skewed and that there are groups out there successfully making use of other architectures?",

Neurosymbolic techniques, rules and other approaches are being explored but they don’t always scale well. But smaller devices and edge cases will benefit from these techniques that can’t just brute force their way to success due to limited size",
