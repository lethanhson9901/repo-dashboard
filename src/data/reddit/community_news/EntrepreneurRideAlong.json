          "text": "Oh we definitely did and still pay monthly for most of the agents we use tbh! I just looked at our billing dashboard and here are the ones that stood out:\n\n1. Gamma: Great for automating making presentations! Gamma created a fully designed presentation for me (including all the content) from a one line prompt in 90 seconds. This was damn impressive!   \n2. Windsurf/Cursor: Everyone in our team gets either Windsurf or Cursor, which has literally tripled our developer output. We ship products much faster now. Personally I am huge fan of Windsurf Cascade agent that as been able to pull off large changes to our production app from a single prompt! But some prefer Cursor!  \n3. Lovable/Bolt: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff!  \n4. Frizerly: I have an automation using Frizerly AI agent that pulls all our Google search console data, and comes up with a strategy for blogs on our website based on last months changes and current strategy. It then auto publishes a blog daily on our wordpress website! It can also generate and publish instagram posts weekly using our exact product images that mostly involves educational content! \n5. Clay: We have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point.\n6. Google Nano Banana: Google Nano Banana has been a game changer in helping us create marketing assets from scratch with simple product images. It can easily turn simple images to full blown product shoots!  \n\n \n\nWould love to learn what others are paying for as well!",

It was a small B2C SaaS that was already making around **$500/month**. Nothing crazy as such, but it was real revenue.\n\nAnd that I exited at 6 figures.\n\nSince then, I’ve bought **5 more businesses**, all for **under $10k**, and every one of them was already making money when I bought it.\n\nI don’t come from a finance background. I wasn’t rich. I just spent time looking for small deals most people ignore.\n\nOne big reason I prefer buying instead of starting from scratch:  \nyou’re not guessing if the idea will work.\n\nThe business already exists. Customers are already paying. There’s way less uncertainty compared to starting something new where you’re testing everything from zero.\n\nIf a bought business doesn’t work out, you usually still have options - improve it, fix obvious issues, or even sell it again. That feels way less risky to me than pouring months (or years) into something that may never make a dollar.\n\nEven while writing this, I can see **dozens of small businesses with revenue** selling for just a few thousand dollars.\n\nWhat actually matters isn’t being rich or “qualified.” It’s more about finding decent deals, being willing to take action (Execution is really imp), negotiating the right price and keep on iterating once you own it, etc.\n\nThere are a lot of businesses out there where **you’d be a better operator than the current owner**.",

If you have basic sales, support, or ops skills, you can often double a tiny SaaS just by tightening those.\n\nI’d add: focus on one channel you can operate well (cold email, content, Reddit, whatever) before chasing new features. I’ve used tools like Apollo and Lemlist for that first sales push, and Pulse for Reddit to catch keywords and threads where people are already complaining about competitors or asking for alternatives.\n\nKey point: you’re buying momentum and a sandbox to learn in, not a finished product-so pick something where your specific skills can move the needle fast.",

Everyone talks about how easy it is now with Claude Code, Antigravity etc.., but they leave out the part where you get completely fucked by production issues that AI can't solve.\n\nPure AI coding gets you maybe 60% there. You can build nice landing pages, set up login systems, even get a decent dashboard running. But then real subscribers start using your product and everything breaks in ways the AI never warned you about.\n\nLemonsqueezy integration that worked perfectly in test mode but randomly failed with real customers. I thought I was making money while actual payments were bouncing. AI couldn't explain webhook validation or why certain cards were getting declined without proper error handling.\n\nDatabase performance that was fine with 10 users but completely shit with 1,000+. Every query started timing out. AI kept suggesting caching fixes instead of telling me I was running garbage queries on unindexed tables. My dashboard was loading every single data point instead of paginating like a normal human would.\n\nUser sessions that just randomly logged people out. What happens when someone's subscription expires while they're using the app? How do you handle multiple browser tabs? AI could fix individual bugs but had no clue how to build proper session management.\n\nData isolation problems where customers could see each other's data. That's a fun support ticket to get. AI had zero understanding of how to debug multi-tenant architecture or why my database setup was fundamentally broken.\n\nBilling logic that looked perfect but created accounting chaos. Proration, failed payment retries, subscription changes - the AI code \"worked\" but had edge cases that destroyed my revenue tracking. One customer downgrading somehow triggered three billing events and I couldn't figure out what the hell happened.\n\nThe turning point was realizing I needed to be a better AI supervisor, not just blindly trust whatever code it spat out. Started setting up actual logging for critical actions, testing payment flows with real cards before launching, keeping a simple spreadsheet of what actually worked vs what looked good in dev.\n\nSpent a few weeks learning database basics, payment processing fundamentals, how web apps actually handle user data and security. Not trying to become a senior dev, just enough to read server logs and understand when something was genuinely broken vs a quick fix.\n\nMost success stories skip the part where they got stuck for weeks on subscription billing or had to hire actual developers to rebuild their payment system. The sweet spot is learning just enough SaaS fundamentals to not get completely destroyed by production, then using AI to move 10x faster on the stuff you actually understand.\n\nStill using AI for 90% of my development, but now I can tell when it's giving me code that'll explode in production vs code that'll actually work with real users and real money.",

AI will happily generate working SQL that's technically correct but absolute garbage at scale. it doesn't think about n+1 queries or what happens when your users table hits 100k rows because it's never had to sit there watching a dashboard spin for 30 seconds.\n\nhonestly the most underrated skill for vibe coding is knowing what questions to ask. like if you'd prompted \"what are the common production gotchas with lemon squeezy webhooks\" before building, you probably would've caught the validation issues early. the AI knows this stuff, it just won't volunteer it unless you ask.",

When something weird happens, you can trace exactly what the app thought was happening vs what actually happened.

In my 35 years in tech, starting back at **Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)** and moving through the dot-com bubble to today, the tools change, but the traps stay the same. You just described what I call the **Circle of Feature Lust** in my e-book, **Startup Inferno**.\n\nAI is a world-class 'cosplayer.' It can act like a Senior Dev, but it has zero accountability for production-level architecture. As you found out, building a UI is easy; building a **robust system** that handles edge cases, race conditions, and multi-tenancy is where the real business lives.\n\n**Two things I want to highlight from your struggle:**\n\n1. **The 'Boring' Fundamentals:** you realized that you don't need to be a Senior Dev, but you DO need to understand the 'boring' stuff (webhooks, indexing, session states). In the Inferno, ignoring the 'boring' is a shortcut to a burn rate disaster.\n2. **AI as an Accelerator, not a Pilot:** using AI for 90% of the code is fine, but as soon as you stop being the 'Architect' and start being just a 'Prompt Engineer,' you've lost control of your company.\n\nI wrote Startup Inferno precisely to help founders like you bridge that gap—understanding the '9 Circles' of mistakes so you can stop the fire before it destroys your database (and your reputation).\n\nKudos to you for staying in the trenches and learning the hard way. That '2 months of hell' just gave you more business acumen than 10 years of 'vibe coding' ever could.",

On the integration side, we’ve found it helps a lot to have customer connections isolated by default (separate auth, separate tenants), which is a big part of why multi-tenancy is built into Cyclr. \n\nWhat's the elevator pitch for Brandled?",

Where it falls apart is when you need to debug production issues at 2am and you don't understand what the code is actually doing. The AI got you there quickly but now you're stuck.\n\nThe sweet spot I've found: use AI to accelerate the parts you already understand. It's a multiplier, not a replacement. If you understand database design, AI helps you write schemas faster. If you don't understand database design, AI gives you a schema that works until it catastrophically doesn't.\n\nThe people who'll win long-term with this approach are the ones treating AI as a senior developer they pair with, not a magic box they delegate to. You still need to review what it produces and understand why it made those choices.\n\nThat said, the barrier to launching a product has never been lower. That's exciting. Just don't confuse \"I shipped something\" with \"I built something maintainable\"!",

      "text": "Started this whole thing in May 2025 because I was burnt out from my consulting gig and wanted something that could run without me being on camera every day. I'm not camera shy exactly, but the idea of filming myself three times a week while also working full time felt exhausting.\n\nThe niche I picked was personal finance for millennials. Saturated? Absolutely. But I figured the content quality bar was still pretty low for faceless channels in that space.\n\nFirst three months were rough. I was using stock footage, basic text animations, and AI voiceover. The videos looked like every other generic finance channel. Growth was basically flat at around 200 subs after posting 25 videos. CPM was decent when I finally got monetized but views were trash so it didn't matter.\n\nThe turning point came when I started thinking about the channel like a character, not just a content machine. I needed a consistent visual identity that wasn't just random stock clips of people typing on laptops.\n\nI experimented with a bunch of different approaches. Tried Midjourney for creating a recurring \"host\" character but the face consistency was all over the place. One video she'd look 25, next video she'd look 40 with completely different bone structure. Looked amateur.\n\nEnded up testing several AI portrait tools. Played around with Artflow, tried the character training on Leonardo, messed with APOB, and a few others I found on Product Hunt. Each had tradeoffs. Some were great at realism but terrible at keeping the same face across generations. Others were consistent but the output looked obviously AI.\n\nWhat finally worked was building out a proper system. I created a character bible with reference images, specific lighting preferences, and a list of expressions that matched different video topics. Took maybe two weeks of iteration but once I had that dialed in, production speed went through the roof.\n\nNow I batch create all my thumbnail and B roll images in one session. Usually takes about 3 hours to generate enough visual assets for 8 to 10 videos. Compare that to the 6+ hours I used to spend hunting for relevant stock footage that wouldn't get me a copyright strike.\n\nThe numbers since making the switch:\n\nMonth 4 to 6: Averaged 2,100 views per video\n\nMonth 7 to 8: Averaging 8,400 views per video\n\nCurrent subscriber count: 4,200\n\nRevenue last month: $847\n\nNot life changing money but the trend line is what matters. And more importantly, I'm actually enjoying the process now instead of dreading every upload.\n\nBiggest lessons from this whole experiment:\n\nConsistency in visual branding matters way more than I thought for faceless channels. Viewers subconsciously recognize your style and it builds trust even without a real human face.\n\nThe tech is good enough now that you don't need to be a designer or spend hours in Photoshop. But you do need to put in upfront work defining what you want before you start generating stuff randomly.\n\nStock footage channels are going to struggle more and more. The bar for \"professional looking\" keeps rising and audiences can tell when you're just slapping generic clips over a script.\n\nStill figuring out the best approach for scaling to a second channel in a different niche. The workflow I built is pretty transferable but picking the right topic is the hard part.",

We’ve built 20 machines that are currently running inside meat processing plants.\n\nWhile working on the industrial machines, I hit a wall: I needed a way to access these remote machines behind firewalls and NATs. I looked for a reliable local tunneling service that supported both TCP and UDP, but existing solutions were either too expensive or didn't fit my specific technical needs.\n\nIn late 2025, the \"AI Agent\" era kicked off. Honestly? I was a huge skeptic. I thought they were good for landing pages or API wrappers, but not for complex network engineering.\n\nI decided to challenge that skepticism: Could I build my own tunneling service using AI agents?\n\nMy goal was to build a profitable SaaS (or at least save money on 3rd party tools). I spent 2 months building this in parallel with my 9-5 and the industrial project.\n\nThe Results:\n\nI am actually shocked by the power of these agents. The result exceeded my expectations. The code isn't perfect, but it works surprisingly well.\n\nI launched the project 3 weeks ago as open sourced. As of today:\n\n* 210 registered users\n* 3-5 active tunnels at any given time (people are actually using it!)\n* 497 stars on GitHub\n* $2 MRR 😆 (It’s not much, but it’s infinitely better than $0)\n\nIf you are skeptical about AI agents for backend work, I encourage you give it a try. It was a massive learning experience.\n\n\n\n",

Building for industrial labeling machines is the definition of solving a 'boring', high-value problem, that’s where the real money is.\n\nYou’ve hit a classic fork in the road. You have 500 stars on GitHub but only $2 MRR. In my e-book, **Startup Inferno**, I’ve seen many brilliant engineers get stuck in the **Circle of Craftsmanship**: you built a great tool, but you might be accidentally building a 'charity' instead of a SaaS.\n\n**My veteran advice for your next 3 months:**\n\n1. **The 'Open Source Trap':** 500 stars mean you solved a dev problem. 2$ MRR means you haven't solved the 'payment friction' yet. Don't let the dopamine of GitHub stars distract you from the brutal reality of unit economics.\n2. **AI Agents for Scale, not just Code:** use those agents now to automate the 'boring' business side (outreach, documentation, support) so you can keep your 9-5 while scaling.\n3. **Don't 'Cosplay' the Hobbyist:** if this is a business, treat the $2 MRR as a fire that needs oxygen.\n\nI wrote Startup Inferno precisely to help technical founders like you navigate the transition from 'cool project' to 'surviving business.'\n\nQuick question: Since you're in the meat processing industry, have you considered selling the 'tunneling' as a premium security feature for industrial IoT rather than a generic dev tool? The margins there are 100x higher.",

This project includes a maximum of 4 major revisions and 4 minor revisions. “Major revision” means moving any part of the design that requires rearranging design elements. “Minor revision” means changes to color or [make your own decision]. Additional revisions are charged by the half hour at $250/hr and payable upon delivery of the revision. Major revisions require at least 2 hours. No ‘extra’ revisions will be accepted unless 90% of the contract is paid; the final 10% is due with final approval of the design prior to delivery of the final product. If the project extends beyond 21 days, the full amount of the contract is due even if the final design has not been approved and the final design formatting will be billed as a final revision. \n\nThe initial consultation leads to x number of designs. After deciding to pursue a design, changing to a different concept will require a new project contract. This contract will be considered complete and a credit applied to the new contract prorated to account for work already complete. This does not matter if the new concept is one of the presented designs or a completely different concept.’\n\nWhen you are sending revisions back, the subject of the email or somewhere very obvious on the deliverable needs to have MAJOR REVISION #2/3 or something similar. When they ask for the first “extra” revision, you send the invoice for the amount due and then wait until it’s paid per your contract terms. It’s scary, but when you hold the line, most people will pay and not even question it. Don’t ever apologize for holding to your agreement. It’s not negotiable until you signal to the client that it is negotiable. Don’t do that.\n\nIn this situation, you dug yourself in. Stop the bleeding and say the project is done and send the bill. If the girlfriend freaks out, move on, send the bill, and be pleasantly surprised when the client pays and apologizes.",

      "text": "Hello,\n\nI’m 21 (in Canada) and a university student, doing computer science. I’m pretty much in my last year. I know the logical thing to do is just finish the degree since I’m almost done, I only have like 9 courses left to do including this current semester. I don’t know whether it’s because I’m juggling too many things at once and I’m burnt out which is why I feel like quitting everything and running away to some island or what.\n\nAbout my work situation. I am taking 3 courses. I’m working on 5 paid projects currently which are related to software development. I’m also working part time on the side remotely as a full stack dev intern. This has given me confidence to build stuff on my own and try to sell it. I contacted one of my old workplaces where I worked as an admin assistant and I remembered a specific problem they had and I was able to provide them a solution for a small price. I’m also good at social skills, so maybe that’s why they remembered me and trusted me?\n\nBefore I had any tech work to do, I was working retail and as a technical instructor to children, and like different summer jobs basically to earn some money.\n\nWhat university has done for me in the past 4 years. The student status helped me get into a program/networking that led to all this current paid work I’m doing and really padded my resume. I also got some paid TAing experience. But what it hasn’t done for me is actually teach me anything…. It probably is my fault since I don’t go to class at all. I don’t remember a single course over the years where I actually went to class regularly. Usually I just go for a few days then stop and work on assignments online and show up before the exam days. I literally only study the night before and cram everything. I get Bs and Cs somehow. My friends tell me I’m crazy for spending so much money doing a degree and I’m not even “making an effort” towards my education, but like they don’t know what I do on the side or how much I’m always working and sacrificing my sleep and I don’t feel like explaining it to them either cuz it doesn’t matter.\n\nBut it does make me wonder whether I’m doing the right thing? Before when I was working simpler jobs where I didn’t have to use my brain as much, university didn’t really bother me. But since the past year, it’s been really bothering me. Last winter semester, I withdrew from classes halfway cuz I just couldn’t take it and only got half tuition refunded. Fall was okay, but now I’m feeling it again, especially since it’s more work than before.\n\nI don’t know if this matters but I’m Asian and I was brought up in a strict abusive household and I learned pretty quickly that unless I earn money I’m pretty useless to everyone, so yea that’s been carved in my brain to “make money” And they probably would have a big problem with me quitting (not that they pay for any of my school, but I live with them)\n\nI literally have an exam in like 6 hours and I can’t bring myself to study, usually I would be cramming, but I just hate it so much. It’s not even that hard.\n\nThe reason I can even think about dropping out and going the entrepreneur route is because of the experience I have gained so far. I am also not romanticizing the idea of entrepreneurship, I know it may be years of grinding and not achieving anything in the end. it’s just something I feel like I must try or I would regret it for the rest of my life. I also don’t have an exact plan in mind of what I would do if I were to drop out today, but the problem is I don’t have the time to THINK about it or explore it since there’s always one thing after another due. I have bunch of ideas listed, but no time to try any of it or validate the market for it.\n\nI feel like I’m shooting a shot in the dark. Idk I’m lost. Any advice is appreciated, thanks.\n\nTLDR; Did you quit uni/college to go the entrepreneur route or did you stick to doing both? How do you even keep going?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the advice. I will probably stick it out, it's just 9 courses left. After this semester, I will have a 4 month break as well so I will be able to reset.",

You are currently in the **Circle of Burnout**, and you are making decisions based on exhaustion, not strategy.\n\nYou have 9 courses left. In the grand scheme of a 40-year career, that is a blink of an eye. If you drop out now, you aren't 'becoming an entrepreneur,' you are just escaping a pressure cooker.\n\n**Here is the reality check from my book, Startup Inferno:** Entrepreneurship is not an escape from hard work; it’s an intensification of it. If you can't manage the 'annoying' task of finishing 9 courses, the 'annoying' tasks of taxes, legal compliance, and failed pivots will crush you even harder.\n\n**My advice to save your sanity and your future:**\n\n1. **The 'Good Enough' Degree:** stop aiming for B's and C's if it costs you your sleep. Aim for the bare minimum to pass. A degree is a binary switch (Yes/No); nobody cares about your GPA once you've built your first SaaS.\n2. **Cut the Projects:** You are working 5 paid projects + an internship + university. That’s not entrepreneurship; that’s **Self-Exploitation**. Drop 2 projects. The money you lose now is cheaper than the therapy you'll need later.\n3. **Validate, Don't Guess:** You say you have ideas but no time to validate. That’s a trap. Most people who quit uni to 'build' end up doing **Startup Cosplay,** acting like founders without a market.\n\nI wrote Startup Inferno for people exactly in your position: high-achievers who are burning out because they don't have a map to navigate the fire.\n\n**Finish the degree.** Not for your parents, but for your 'Future Founder' self. It’s the ultimate test of finishing what you start, a trait every successful entrepreneur needs.\n\nTake a breath. Go to that exam in 6 hours. Don't study to master it; study to survive it.",

If they continue to fall short, then you need to have a tougher conversation.\n\nMicromanaging would be overseeing exactly how they're completing tasks within a milestone.

Generally, people who have fewer skills than us make money faster because they don't tend to think so much; they just act... even if they don't fully understand the whole picture and even if that may seem reckless. In reality, it helps them test things faster and more cheaply. Recommendation: find a “pain point” in a particular industry or community and simply try to solve it. It doesn't have to be beautiful, detailed, or scalable. You just need a rudimentary way to solve the problem and publish it. That way, you test the product and find out what your audience thinks.  \nThen you decide whether it is worth dedicating time and effort to making it grow.",

They'd come in with a solid idea, spend months building, and then just... stall. Not because the tech was hard. Because they kept adding things.\n\nFeature after feature, \"oh we also need this,\" and suddenly what was supposed to be a simple product turned into a massive project with no clear finish line.\n\nSo at some point I started forcing a framework on every project I touched. I call it the 3-3-5 rule and honestly it's pretty simple once you see it.\n\nThe idea is you cap everything. No exceptions.\n\n3 database entities. That's your max. Like Users, Listings, and Bookings or whatever makes sense for your product. You want to add a fourth? Cool, that's a V2 conversation.\n\n3 external APIs. Stripe, an email service, maybe an AI API. Pick three. Every single integration you add is another thing that can slow you down or break.\n\n5 core user flows. Just map out the actual path a user takes. Something like sign up, create a listing, browse, book, pay. That's it. If something doesn't fit into one of those five flows, it's not going in.\n\nWe've been shipping MVPs inside this box in about 30 days using Supabase and React. The budget usually lands around $4k. And the reason it works isn't because we're doing anything crazy technically. It's just that the constraints force you to actually decide what matters before you start coding.\n\nAnyway, curious if anyone else has run into this. The hardest part honestly is just getting founders to agree to cut stuff. Happy to talk through how we actually figure out which flows make the cut if anyone's interested.",

      "text": "I wasn’t trying to find my next big thing that day. I was just killing time, half-curious, half-restless, typing vague searches like “interesting startup ideas” and opening whatever looked remotely useful. Most of it was the usual stuff I’d seen a hundred times before, and I was about to give up when I clicked into a database-style site full of structured ideas and problem statements.startupideasDB\n\nAt first I treated it like light reading. Scroll, skim, move on. But something felt different. Instead of grand visions or hypey trends, each entry described a very specific, almost mundane problem someone out there was actually dealing with. And alongside it was a simple, practical way to solve it. It felt less like browsing content and more like walking past rows of unbuilt tools, each one quietly saying, “you could make me.”\n\nOne problem stopped me mid-scroll. It was so familiar that I could immediately picture the people who would use a solution for it. My brain switched from passive reading to active imagining. What would the first screen look like? What’s the smallest useful version of this? Could I hack together a prototype in a weekend?\n\nI tried to keep browsing, but my mind kept drifting back to that one idea. By the time I closed the tab, I wasn’t thinking about ten possibilities anymore, just that single, stubborn concept that refused to leave. Later that evening I opened my notes app “just to jot down a few thoughts” and ended up mapping out features and user flows until well past midnight.\nIt felt oddly effortless. Not because the work would be easy, but because the direction was suddenly clear. For months I’d been stuck in endless ideation, waiting for a lightning bolt. Instead, what moved me forward was simply running into a well-defined problem at the right time and realizing, almost casually, that I was capable of solving it.\n\nI don’t know where this project will end up, but I do know that the search is over. I’m no longer wandering through abstract possibilities; I’m building something concrete. All it took was a quiet moment of discovery that turned idle browsing into a starting line.",

Bought a \"clean\" list, loaded it into a sequence, hit send, and waited for replies like an idiot. Opens were mid, replies were dead, and bounces kept creeping up. I kept blaming subject lines and rewriting my pitch, but the real problem was I was emailing the wrong people. Wrong roles, wrong industries, old contacts, random info that made personalization impossible. I was basically doing spam with extra steps.\n\nHere’s what I changed and it finally started working. I stopped chasing big lists and started building small, tight segments. One niche, one city, one exact buyer type. I do quick spot checks on the company site so I know they are actually my ICP, then I validate emails before anything goes into a sequence. First email stays plain text with no links and one simple question. I send 100 to 200 at a time, see what gets replies, then double down on that exact segment.\n\nMost \"cold email problems\" are not copy problems. They are list problems. If your targeting is off, you can write the best email on Earth and it still dies in silence.",

It's live on iOS and Android and it's growing — now I need help pushing harder on the marketing side.\n\nI'm technical and I can sell, but I'm one person. Looking for someone who wants to work with content/social and influencer partnerships. Both the strategy and the execution.\n\nBudget is lean, so this needs to be scrappy. I'm not looking for someone who needs a big ad budget to be useful. I want someone who's resourceful and excited by the constraint.\n\nOpen to rev share, equity, paid, or a combo. Flexible on timeline too. Could be a focused sprint or something longer.\n\nPlease DM me if this is something that catches your attention. ",
