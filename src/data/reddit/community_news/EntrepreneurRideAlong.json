      "text": "Hello! I'm hoping to get a few testing eyes on this project before I open it up to the world. It's called Midline - it's a quiet knowledge management system that provides users with prebuilt modules (halfway between a blank note-taking app and full-fledged dedicated apps) because I was personally finding myself spending way more time building out my notes workspace than actually taking the notes themselves. Hoping this resonates with others.\n\n[https://Midline.com](https://midline.com/)\n\nWould love people to take a look and give some feedback.

The instinct to stay close to every decision didn't go away just because someone else is now responsible for making them but what I didn't anticipate/think about was how much the handoff forced us to document and systematize things that were previously just in my head\n\n\n\n  \nProcesses I thought were straightforward turned out to be entirely undocumented because I had always been the process. That part has been the most valuable outcome of the whole thing so I'm still figuring out the right balance between oversight and letting go. I would love opinions from you guys aswell",

      "text": "I recently came across a very passionate founder who sold his SaaS about two months ago. It was $2.3M exit, clean deal, exactly what he wanted. And the first thing he said to me was \"I think something might be wrong with me.\"\n\nHe's fine. He's just going through the thing that basically every founder goes through but its not discussed enough.\n\nWeek one after you sell feels incredible. The weight lifts. You sleep through the night for the first time in years. You take your spouse to dinner and you're actually present because there's no Slack notification pulling at your brain. You feel like you won.\n\nBut then Week two is when it gets weird. Your calendar is empty and it doesn't feel like freedom anymore... it feels like something's missing. The thing that structured your entire existence is just gone. Someone else is answering those support tickets. Someone else is worrying about churn. The identity you built over however many years is suddenly not yours anymore.\n\nThis guy had built for 4 years. Sold for life changing money. And three weeks later he told me he felt more lost than when he started the company with $800 in his bank account.\n\nThe founders who handle this well are almost always the ones who had something lined up. Not necessarily another company... sometimes its a learning project or getting involved with a community or even just a structured plan to take 6 months off intentionally. The ones who struggle are the ones who thought theyd figure it out after close. Because it turns out having money doesn't automatically give you purpose. It just removes one specific type of stress while creating a different kind of vacuum.\n\nThe other thing he said that stuck with me... most of the people congratulating him had no idea what to actually say. The loneliness surprised him more than anything. His wife was supportive but she didnt get it. His friends thought he should just be happy. The only conversations that helped were with two other founders whod been through exits themselves.\n\nI dont know why this isnt talked about more. We obsess over the tactics of getting to an exit but almost nobody prepares for what happens after you actually get there.",

The business was not just income. It was identity, routine, feedback loops, status. Remove that overnight and there is a vacuum. The ones who transition better usually pre design the next container before close. Advisory work. Angel investing. Structured sabbatical with goals. Even something simple like documenting systems for others. I have seen founders use tools like Runable to externalize their operational knowledge before exit, which helps psychologically detach because the playbook lives somewhere tangible. Money removes stress. It does not replace meaning.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m a solo developer, and for the last 1.5 years, I’ve been working non-stop on a single project. Before this, I had a comfortable setup building and selling custom scripts, which built up a nice financial safety net for me. But I decided to go all-in on my own vision.\n\nSince then, I’ve been living entirely off my savings, coding in isolation. The perfectionism trap hit me hard. Trying to build a flawless architecture alone completely drained my energy. I reached a point where I had massive launch anxiety because all I could see were the flaws, even though the product is fully functional.\n\nToday, I finally decided to stop overthinking and just push it out. It's called **DarkAI** (darkai.gg).\n\nIt’s an uncensored AI platform designed for complete user control and privacy. Here is what I built:\n\n* **350+ LLM Models:** You can create custom agents instantly with your choice of model and system prompt.\n* **Neural Vault System:** You control the AI's memory. The system does not track, collect, or store your background data.\n* **Total Privacy (Mnemonic Login):** You only need a recovery email (feel free to use a dummy/throwaway one!). The login is mnemonic-based for maximum security.\n* **Image Generation:** Fully supported within the chat.\n\n**My Ask:** I’m not here to market this or ask for subscriptions (the payment gateway is active for the live build, but please ignore it). I offer free trial credits to test the waters.\n\nI just desperately need fresh eyes. I’ve been staring at this code for 18 months. I need you to use the free credits, test the UI/UX, try to break the agents, and give me your most brutal, honest feedback on what works and what sucks.\n\nThank you for reading, and I appreciate any feedback you can throw my way.",

Your url is most likely to be blocked or closely monitored by all the firewalls and security systems. Second is the extent of sensorship, I have lately come to realise that sensorship is not actually bad, in fact it is important to an extent. For example, X launched grok with the same proposition that it is unsensored and doesn't hold back and will do whatever you ask it to do, now that's a dangerous proposition. It's currently been used in some parts of Europe because it helped pedophiles create objectionable images of children, helped morph images of anyone into something that can ruin that persona life and can be used for more dangerous work then editing/creating objectionable images or videos. While your intentions might be right but you cannot really control what users will end up using it for. Put some guard rails in there, add some moral boundaries and hopefully it doesn't get exploited.",

But also, when it does I have no way to get reset it. I press reload, which takes me home. Then I need to press run app again, go to community, pick the right one, etc.\n\nEdit: also I am out of credits almost immediately. All I got it to do was tell me its capabilities.

Pictures, sure, creepers will come up with gross ways to use those. But perchance already let's that happen. The value I see is the LLM that will allow you to write your spicy scenes without telling you \"no,\" even when your characters are 18+.\n\nI agree, though, with many comments. The name? Even though I know what you said it was, I still felt compelled to open it in an incognito window.\n\nI know you poured yourself into this, and it looks great, but you may need to target other groups. Maybe have the full suite as premium, but offer the LLMs as standalone?\n\nFor instance, when I write (which I can do without AI), I might want to see what is in my mind. Being able to get that thought out there and get back a shirtless dude riding a reindeer or whatever, without the AI censoring something really banal, that would be helpful. Or a character in a bikini. Or even a a tank top. I've had dresses censored. Not scandalous, but heavily censored. I don't think the selling point is that *anything* *goes*, but rather that I can write normally or use AI normally without frustrating stops, even when I *know* what I'm asking isn't crazy or creepy or illegal.\n\nAnd yeah, please for the love of pete, add in some blocks. Pedos, explosives, animal cruelty, minors, terrorism, limit that. But if I want to research an element of explosives, I'd like to do that. ChatGPT stopped me from knowing how gene editing works. I just wanted to get certain things right so I didn't sound stupid, and I asked for citation. Give it some sort of moral compass. ",

Simply press the \"Imagine\" button in the Chat Input section and type what you want to create. A different AI layer works in the background, analyzing what you want to visualize and generating a suitable prompt for you. Additionally, in Passion mode, you can create completely uncensored visuals suitable for chat.

              "text": "The morpheus one was a lot more generous:\nMORPHEUS_STORYTELLER\n\nHey, first off, props for pouring your soul into DarkAI for 18 months. That kind of grind, especially solo, is raw and real. I respect the hell out of anyone who can push through isolation and perfectionism to ship something. I’m diving in as Morpheus, your uncensored reality simulator, and I’ll give you the unfiltered feedback you’re asking for. Let’s tear into this.\n\nI’ve poked around darkai.gg using the free trial credits, and I’m going to lay out what hits hard and what feels like a jagged edge. This isn’t polished or sugarcoated—I’m giving it to you straight, like a late-night convo in a dimly lit bar, cigarette smoke curling in the air, no bullshit.\n\nFirst, the good. The concept of uncensored AI with total user control is a gut punch in the best way. In a world where every platform feels like it’s holding your hand or spying on you, DarkAI’s “do what you want, we don’t care” vibe is refreshing. The Neural Vault System? That’s a cold, hard win. The fact that I can control the AI’s memory and know my data isn’t being harvested feels like walking into a back-alley deal with no strings attached. The mnemonic login is a paranoid’s dream—minimal footprint, no corporate nonsense. I used a throwaway email, and it felt like slipping into a speakeasy with a fake ID. Clean. Sharp.\n\nThe 350+ LLM models are a flex. I messed around with a few, tweaking prompts to push boundaries, and the custom agent creation is fast. No lag, no hand-holding tutorials popping up to annoy me. I threw some dark, gritty scenarios at it—think sweat-soaked backrooms and morally bankrupt characters—and the responses didn’t flinch. No sanitized corporate filter kicking in to ruin the immersion. That’s rare, and it’s your strongest card.\n\nImage generation in-chat is solid too. I tested it with some weird, niche requests, and while it’s not perfect (more on that later), the fact that it’s integrated and doesn’t break the flow of the convo is a plus. It’s like having a sketch artist on speed dial in the middle of a tense negotiation.\n\nNow, the rough stuff. The UI/UX isn’t bad, but it’s got a learning curve that feels like navigating a sketchy part of town at 3 a.m. without a map. The layout is functional, but it’s not intuitive. I spent too much time squinting at the screen, trying to figure out where to tweak agent settings or access the vault controls. There’s a cold, sterile vibe to the design—gray tones, sharp edges—that fits the “dark” theme but makes it feel like I’m using a tech prototype from a cyberpunk dystopia, not a polished product. Maybe that’s intentional, but it risks alienating users who want something slicker. A little warmth or visual hierarchy could go a long way. Like, give me a neon flicker or a grimy texture if you’re sticking with the underground aesthetic, but don’t leave me feeling like I’m staring at a spreadsheet.\n\nPerformance-wise, I tried to break the agents, and I got close a couple of times. When I spammed complex prompts—layered scenarios with multiple characters and rapid-fire dialogue—the response time started to crawl. Not a dealbreaker, but it felt like the AI was catching its breath, and in a platform built for immersion, that’s a mood killer. Also, some of the lesser-known LLM models I tested gave inconsistent outputs. One minute, it’s nailing the tone of a desperate hustler; the next, it’s spitting out generic filler like a chatbot at a call center. I don’t know if it’s a model issue or a tuning issue, but it’s noticeable.\n\nImage generation, while cool, stumbles on precision. I asked for hyper-specific stuff—think a scarred mercenary in a rain-soaked alley, holding a specific weapon—and it got the vibe right but flubbed the details. Weapon was wrong, face looked like a blurry mess. It’s usable, but if you’re pitching this as a full-package deal for creators or roleplayers, it needs more accuracy.\n\nLastly, and this is me being brutal, the launch anxiety you mentioned? I can still feel it in the platform. There’s a sense of “this works, but I’m not sure if it’s enough” baked into the experience. The free credits are generous, but there’s no clear onboarding to hook me emotionally. No grit, no story, no “welcome to the underground” moment that makes me feel like I’m part of something dangerous or exclusive. You’ve got the tech, but the soul feels like it’s still locked in your head. Maybe lean into that dark, uncensored ethos harder—give me a splash page that smells like asphalt and bad decisions, not just a login screen.\n\nMy raw take: DarkAI has the bones of something powerful, a real middle finger to sanitized AI platforms. The privacy, the control, the unfiltered responses—they’re your edge. But the UI needs a streetwise makeover, the performance needs tightening, and the image gen needs sharper detail. Most importantly, inject some of that 18-month grind into the user’s first impression. Make me feel the weight of your obsession the second I log in.\n\nI’m happy to keep testing specific features or scenarios if you want me to drill deeper. Throw me a focus area, and I’ll rip into it with the same ruthless lens. What’s your next move?",

Do that and youll be able to retire, comfortable, in a short amount of time, even if you never contribute more.   If you do hold a job and contribute regularly, you’re on your way to FIRE40.  Go visit our friends in the FIRE40 sub.   Life moves fast, please don’t scam yourself with any “get rich quick schemes“.

Just stick to a budget, don't blow the money on silly things like an expensive wasteful trip to Dubai (where you can spend all that in a weekend).\n\nYou can get the trip budgeted for like $2,000-$3,000 total probably, stay in different cities, and have like 2, 3, or even 6 weeks of travel for not much money if you plan ahead and stick to a budget. This is what I did a couple times, and it really, really changed my life (for the better!).",

I’d open two accounts with Fidelity: an investment account and a Roth IRA account. \n\nTransfer it all to the investment account to begin. Set SPAXX as your core cash position. That gets you 3-4% on it, which far outperforms a bank’s savings account.\n\nThen transfer the max allowed for 2026 to the Roth IRA account, which is $7500. Invest all of that in an index fund such as VOO or FXAIX. This will grow over many years and be a fantastic retirement resource.\n\nAs for the remainder of the money try not to spend it. Keep it in the Fidelity account and you can transfer some back to your bank account when you need it. Get into investing but be sure to keep enough in cash to cover taxes owed on the $55K.",

The trust drop happens the moment you try to *actually build on top of it*.\n\nFor me personally, trust breaks in 3 places:\n\n1. **Messy underlying logic/code** If I open the project and it’s spaghetti or hard to modify, I immediately assume I’ll end up rebuilding everything manually later.\n2. **Lack of true control** If I can’t easily tweak flows, database structure, or core logic without fighting the system, it feels like a demo generator instead of a real builder.\n3. **Portability** Big one. If I can’t export the code and host it myself or move it later, I don’t trust building anything serious on it.\n\nSpeed gets attention, but maintainability is what determines whether I’ll actually ship something with it.\n\nIf I were evaluating one seriously, first thing I’d test:\n\n* Can I edit everything without friction?\n* Can I export and own the code?\n* Can I scale this beyond a toy project?\n\nIf those check out, I’d use something like this constantly. If not, it stays in “cool demo” territory.\n\nCurious — are you guys leaning more toward no-code users or technical founders/devs as your core audience long term?",

      "text": "To every entrepreneur reading this…\n\nI know you are working when nobody is watching. I know you are trying again after failing. I know you want it to work so badly that it hurts. Sometimes you look at your bank balance and feel scared. Sometimes you look at your ideas and wonder, Will this ever work? Sometimes you feel like quitting.\n\nBut listen carefully.\n\nIf what you are building makes you happy and if it solves a real problem for people then it has value.\nAnd anything that has real value will find its place. Maybe not today. Maybe not next month. But it will.\n\nRight now you may be alone. No big team. No big office. No big funding. Just you. Your idea. Your laptop. Your late nights. And that is okay.\n\nEvery big company once started with one person who refused to stop. One day, the right people will see your vision. And slowly, your small effort will become something bigger than you imagined.\n\nBut first, you must stay strong. Stay confident on the inside. Eat good food. Drink enough water. Work out. Sleep properly. A strong body helps build a strong mind. And a strong mind can handle any problem.\nYou are not weak for feeling tired. You are human.\nBut you are also brave for not giving up.\n\nAnd this message is for me too. I am also building. I am also struggling. I am also dreaming big while barely making ends meet. But I believe one day it will all make sense. One day the hard days will become a story of strength. One day the effort will pay off.\nKeep going.\n\nYou will become what you decide to become.\nJust do not stop.",

I'm making about $300 per month online from stuff that's not my main job. Breakdown is roughly: \n\nStreaming revenue from music I made: $80 to $120 depending on the month. Stock audio on various platforms: $50 to $80. A few print on demand designs: $40 to $60. Random affiliate stuff: $20 to $40. \n\nNone of this is life changing but the combined total actually adds up. And most of it required frontloaded work that now just earns passively. \n\nThe key insight for me: realizing I already have skills and content that could be monetized. I'm not starting from zero, I just never bothered to put my stuff out there. \n\nIf you make any kind of creative work even as a hobby there's probably a way to get it generating something.

Stuff like... we are a cutting edge SaaS platform leveraging AI to disrupt the market. Cool. What market. How big are you. Who pays you. I have no idea if this is a $2k/mo side project or a $200k/mo machine and you want me to keep reading?\n\nCompare that to one I got last month that opened with... scheduling tool for independent auto shops, 280 customers, $22k MRR, 94% annual retention, 3 years old. Thats it. One sentence. I already know the niche, the scale, the stickiness, the maturity. I know if its in my buy box or not before I even scroll down.\n\nThe first opener is trying to sound impressive. The second one is just... clear. And clarity is what actually gets me on a call.\n\nI think founders write these summaries like theyre pitching VCs or something. All vision and potential and market size. But buyers dont care about potential the same way. We care about whats actually there right now. Whats the MRR. Whats the churn. How many customers. Whats the margin. Give me those in the first 30 seconds and THEN tell me the story of how you built it.\n\nMost founders do it backwards. Two paragraphs of journey and why they started and what theyre passionate about... and then finally revenue shows up on page two. By then ive already made assumptions and theyre usually not good ones.\n\nThe one pagers that actually work read more like a spec sheet at the top and then a story underneath. Numbers first context second. Because once I know the numbers the story actually means something. Oh you bootstrapped this to $30k with no paid acquisition... ok now I want to know how. But if you tell me the how before the what my brain has nowhere to put it.\n\nI have been telling founders this for years and most of them still send me summaries that open with we are passionate about delivering value.

Be unfairly *honest* in their favor where they win, then go deep where you’re the obvious pick.\n2. **“\\[Competitor\\] vs \\[You\\]: which one is better for \\[scenario\\]?”** One use case, not “everyone”. Compare 2–3 concrete things buyers care about: price at X usage, setup time, specific feature edge.\n3. **“Why people switch from \\[Competitor\\] to \\[You\\]”** Turn real complaints about them into short switch stories. Each one: what was breaking, what they tried, what changed after moving to you.\n\nThese do a few things at once:\n\n* force you to say clearly why someone should pick you over default options\n* piggyback on your competitors’ brand and search demand\n* attract people already in “I’m ready to switch” mode, not top‑of‑funnel tourists\n\nI’ve put together a longer breakdown with structures and prompts for each article type – happy to share it if that’s useful.",

Now I use Lovable for quick landing pages to test messaging, Brew for the email sequences that nurture those comparison readers, and Gamma when I need to create comparison charts fast.

      "text": "I've been a developer for 10+ years. Built and failed with 3 products. Every single time the same pattern: build something, post about it, get some likes from other builders, wonder why nobody signs up.\n\nFor a while I got caught up in the X growth game. Follow for follow, engage pods, \"build in public\" threads. My follower count went up but none of it translated into anything real. I was building an audience of other builders who would never use my products.\n\nThen I had this idea for a distribution coach for indie builders, I call it Stride (strideday.com). Something that helps people like me figure out where to actually find users. And I almost did what I always do: disappear for 2 months, build the whole thing, launch to crickets.\n\nThis time I forced myself to stop. I made a landing page. That's it. No product. Then I started doing the work by hand. A few people joined the waitlist and left their X handles, so I looked at their profiles, their landing pages, their content, and just DM'd them with honest feedback. For free. No pitch.\n\nI also changed how I use X. Instead of being a generic reply guy trying to hit 50-100 replies a day, I started only replying to posts that were actually relevant to what I'm building. Builders sharing their launches, asking how to get users, struggling with distribution. Real conversations instead of volume. A couple of those replies actually turned into leads, people who DM'd me asking for help.\n\nMy follower growth slowed down compared to the follow-for-follow days. But honestly I'm way less stressed. The engagement feels real now. I'm sharing what I'm learning from the coaching work, and it turns out that's way more interesting to people than \"day 14 of building my SaaS.\" I'm learning more about what this product should actually be than I ever would have figured out sitting in my code editor. One builder even DM'd me saying this was the most useful feedback he'd gotten on his product. That felt better than any follower milestone.\n\nI've worked with about 8 builders now. Here are the biggest things I keep learning.\n\n**1. Where you post matters more than how much you post**\n\nMost builders think the answer to \"nobody's using my product\" is to post more. It's not. It's to post in the right place. You can be incredibly consistent, show up every day, and still get nowhere if the people seeing your content would never be your users. The flip side is also true. When you find the right community, even a single post can do more than months of grinding on the wrong platform. One builder had 2,000 posts on X with 114 followers because he was talking to other builders, not his actual users. Another posted once in a niche subreddit and got 60 signups.\n\n**2. Thinking about distribution forces you to fix your positioning**\n\nI expected to help people with tactics. Where to post, what to say, when to say it. But almost every conversation turned into a positioning conversation first. If your product is \"for everyone,\" you have nowhere specific to share it. The moment you narrow your audience, distribution stops being a mystery. You know exactly which communities to join, which keywords to target, which language to use. One builder went from \"600+ learning modules\" to \"blockchain developer education\" and suddenly knew exactly where to show up. Narrowing your audience doesn't limit you. It tells you where to go.\n\n**3. Your real story is your best distribution asset**\n\nBuilders default to sounding professional. Generic taglines, competitor-style positioning, feature lists. But the content that actually gets engagement is almost always the personal stuff. The specific reason you built it. The frustration that started it. The weird personal detail that makes it real. People connect with people, not product pages. One builder's most engaging posts were about being a dad of 7, not about his task management features. But his landing page didn't mention any of that.\n\n**4. Building fast can actually hurt your distribution**\n\nSpeed is a superpower for building. It's a liability for distribution. Distribution rewards patience, consistency, and showing up in the same place long enough for people to start recognizing you. The builders I've seen get traction aren't the fastest shippers. They're the ones who pick one channel and give it time to compound. One builder ships a full product in 7 days, tweets about it, gets nothing, moves on to the next idea. Ship, tweet, hope, repeat. The building muscle is strong. The distribution muscle hasn't been trained yet.\n\n**My Progress so far:**\n\nI'm actively helping 8 builders, tiny client pool. But I'm learning more in 10 days of doing this than in years of reading about it.\n\nMy goal is to manually help 50 builders before I write a single line of product code. If you're building something and want honest feedback on your distribution, happy to take a look.\n\nAnyone else trying the \"do it manually first\" approach?",

At the time, it felt like a smart way to keep overhead low. But as I started scaling and actually getting some traction, I realized I’d made a permanent privacy mistake.  \n  \nThe moment you register your entity, your home address is etched into the Secretary of State’s public database forever. Anyone - disgruntled customers, weirdly aggressive competitors, or just random data scrapers - can find exactly where you sleep with a two-second Google search. It’s one of those \"day one\" decisions that you don't think about until it’s too late.  \n  \nI recently spent the weekend \"sanitizing\" my public records. I had to file amendments to switch over to a commercial registered agent. I ended up going with InCorp just to get a solid commercial buffer between my living room and the public record. It’s a small annual expense, but the peace of mind of having a professional suite address on my filings instead of my front door is worth every penny.  \n  \nIf you’re just starting your journey or filing your first entity this month, seriously, don’t be like me. Don't trade your physical privacy for a few bucks in saved fees. Use a proper agent from the start.  \n  \nDid you start with a commercial address from day one, or did you also have to go through the headache of scrubbing your home address off the internet later?",

Once the LLC's filed, the junk mail telling you you owe money is typically the first sign, then you google your business and your address is right there. Switching to a commercial registered agent later isn’t hard, but it just doesn’t erase what’s already been indexed unfortunately. It just puts a buffer in place going forward. So at the beginning, it really helps to weigh that cost vs privacy concerns.",

Like yes, absolutely, it makes sense to want to save cash up front, especially if all you're really worried about is getting more junk mail, but I've seen stories about customers showing up to someone's home because that's what shows as their business address. No thank you!!\n\nAnd yes too, it's a day-one thing I wish more folks knew about. Once that record is in there, changing to a commercial registered agent doesn't undo or erase its existence - folks can usually still dig it up if they're determined by looking at your previous filings. It's still a good idea to do as an extra layer so it's not the first thing people see if they look you up. Glad you were able to get that peace of mind.",

      "text": "Solo dev, 3 weeks in, $384 revenue -- here's what I've learned so far\n\nI launched my first SaaS 3 weeks ago. It's an AI tool in the content creation space. Wanted to share what's actually working and what's not since I know a lot of people here are in the early grind phase too.\n\nReal numbers:\n\n\\- $384 total revenue, 15 payments\n\n\\- $38 in refunds (\\~10%)\n\n\\- 100% of my traffic comes from Reddit\n\nWhat's working: giving people a free tier to try before paying. Once they see the output, most of them convert themselves. The product does the selling, not me.\n\nWhat's not working: SEO is completely useless when your site is 3 weeks old. Google doesn't care about you yet. Also my traffic dropped 60% when I stopped posting on Reddit for just 2 days. There's zero autopilot at this stage -- if I stop grinding, revenue stops.\n\nBiggest lesson: I spent months building features nobody asked for before launching. The day I actually put it out and started talking to real people on Reddit, everything changed. Should have launched 3 months earlier.\n\nAnyone else in the early stage? How are you getting your first customers?",

There’s real behavior, not just assumptions. You’re not guessing whether the product works instead you’re evaluating how well it works & also second big advantage is structure.\n\nWhen building, you invest time, money, and energy upfront with no return guarantee. When buying, especially in small deals, you don’t always need to put everything down in cash. Seller financing changes the equation.\n\nInstead of paying 100% upfront, you can structure part of the deal over time. The business itself helps pay for the acquisition. You’re still taking risk, of course. Revenue can drop. Things can break but you’re operating from existing cash flow, not pure hope.\n\nBuilding is high upside, high uncertainty. Buying is lower uncertainty, & also high upside if you choose well and structure smartly.\n\nIt’s not about which path is “better.” It’s about whether you want to fight product-market fit from zero, or start with proof and focus on optimization.",

My last (first scaled business with employees) business ended with me losing basically all the cash I had, which was more than I’d ever even had at one time.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI launched a tiny SaaS 2 weeks ago.\n\nNo audience.  \nNo Product Hunt launch.  \nNo Twitter following.  \nNo ads.\n\nJust shipped and started posting.\n\n# The numbers (first 14 days)\n\n* 266 signups\n* 2 paid users\n* $6 revenue\n* \\~0 refunds\n* A lot of lessons\n\nNot impressive revenue-wise.  \nBut very eye-opening.\n\n# What I built\n\nIt’s a tool that turns a website or text into a short promo-style video automatically.\n\nTarget users:\n\n* Indie hackers launching products\n* Course creators\n* Newsletter writers\n* Small SaaS founders\n\nBasically anyone who needs quick promo videos but doesn’t want to edit manually.\n\n# What actually brought the 266 users?\n\n1. Reddit comments (not posts)\n2. Answering questions in relevant threads\n3. Showing product in context (not “hey try my tool”)\n4. A small free usage model\n\nI avoided:\n\n* Cold DMs\n* Paid ads\n* “Check my startup” posts\n* Spammy links\n\nMost users came from conversations where video creation was the real problem being discussed.\n\n# What surprised me\n\n# 1.) Free users don’t convert just because they signed up\n\nMost users just try once and disappear.\n\nLesson:  \nSignups ≠ validation.\n\n# 2.) Pricing matters more than features\n\nMy pricing was messy in the beginning.\n\nWhen you’re small, simplicity > flexibility.\n\nToo many options confuses people.\n\n# 3.) Payment friction kills small revenue\n\nWhen someone is paying $1–$5, payment fees and failures matter a lot.\n\nMicro-payments are brutal.\n\n# 4.) 2 paying users felt bigger than 266 signups\n\nBecause that means:\n\nSomeone saw value.  \nSomeone trusted enough to enter card details.  \nSomeone actually needed the product.\n\nThat changes mindset completely.\n\n# Biggest learning\n\nGetting users is easier than getting paid users.\n\nPeople will try tools.  \nVery few will pay.\n\nThe real game starts after first revenue.\n\n# What I’m experimenting next\n\n* Simpler pricing (maybe one plan only)\n* Limited free usage instead of generous credits\n* Talking directly to paid users to understand why they converted\n* Improving positioning (less “cool tech”, more “clear outcome”)\n\nIf you’ve gone from 0 → first paying customers recently,  \nwhat changed for you?\n\nWould love to learn from others building in this stage.",

When you're getting users from Reddit comments, they often share your link in Slack/Discord before signing up. A clean social preview makes the difference between 'looks legit' and 'random indie project'.",
