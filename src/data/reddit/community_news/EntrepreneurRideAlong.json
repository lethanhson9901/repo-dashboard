      "text": "I see hundreds of post each week with people asking for the magic pill to become successful. I would sell this info for $99 but no one would buy it because there is really no secret to it.\n\n1.\t⁠Worked 14 years (steady 9-5 w2 job)without a vacation or a off day. Literally missed 6 hours of work the day my son was born and another day when I had the swine flu. Saved money\n\n2.\t⁠Picked a industry that created the most millionaires and spent every waking second learning as much as I could about the industry and all the different niches and verticals. (Real estate)\n\n3.\t⁠Found the most successful people in my area and emailed them asking how I could provide value to them in exchange for learning and eventually having opportunities to be apart of deals.\n\n4.\t⁠Obtained a real estate license and agreed to write offers for a group of investors, I would receive $750 at closing and credit the rest of my commission to the investors. Wrote thousands of offers and pocketed over $100k cash, credited close to a million to the investors.\n\n5.\t⁠Learned what the investors looked for, who they used for lending and contractors. Started to buy my own properties and do joint ventures with the investors group.\n\n6.\t⁠Found contractors in the service industry who were great operators but terrible at business. Bought into their companies and assembled a team to handle the backend. (Hvac, roofing, roll off dumpsters).\n\n7.\t⁠Built a portfolio of 19 rental houses that I paid on average $125k for. When the market spiked I sold 14 of the properties for a average of $310k per unit.\n\n8.\t⁠Paid off the 5 rental properties and that cash flow pays my living expenses. Dumped the rest of the money into a self strorage deal, and short term rentals. At the age of 38 my net worth was north of 4 million and my monthly cash flow from all properties and businesses is over $20k a month with some months hitting $60k. It took 20 years and a lot of 80 work weeks to build “passive income”. Looking back I regret not spending time with my kids and family. Having money is nice but relationships, family, health, and memories is a lot better. The more you make the more you spend. My life and problems are still similar to when I was paycheck to paycheck, I just have nicer cars, house, and am able to do whatever I want whenever I want. Which gets boring quicker than you would think. The market has changed so much I no longer invest in real estate, have seen a lot of people over leverage and lose it all. Hope this rant helps someone. Key point to take away is just find something and go all in, but also live your life and cherish your family, friends, health",

For the first ~14 years I was still working 9–5 and doing real estate at nights and weekends. The only part that really felt “all in” was the later stage when I already had some capital, experience, and a network.\n\t2.\tI didn’t quit and go unpaid. I was extremely conservative early on. I saved aggressively from my job, lived way below my means, and used that as my runway. Real estate was something I layered on top, not something I jumped into blind. Time was the bigger constraint than money — it meant a lot of late nights, weekends, and saying no to almost everything else.\n\t3.\tEverything overlapped. Learning never stopped. Writing offers, networking, finding contractors, investing, buying into businesses — it all happened in parallel once momentum started. The “steps” only look neat in hindsight. In reality it was messy, lots of trial and error, and plenty of dead ends.\n\nBiggest thing I’d stress: there was no master plan. Just consistent effort over a long time, and being willing to look stupid, work more than everyone else, and stick around long enough for compounding to kick in.",

And the tricky part of compounding is that it doesnt look like much for quite a while, but then it \"suddenly\" takes off.\n\nTo your credit, though, what you did was a really smart way to make your own opportunity, even if that master plan didnt exist.

I really don’t want fake clicks or bots that bounce immediately, so I want real website traffic. I’m hoping to find something that sends visitors who look natural, browse my website, and show up properly in analytics, since that is important for getting approved by ad networks.\n\nIt also matters to me that I can buy traffic and have an option to choose visitor locations, and that the traffic arrives gradually instead of flooding in all at once, so it keeps looking realistic. If anyone has tested a site that held up long term without causing penalties or strange ranking drops, I’d really appreciate any recommendations.",

He found this expensive vendor that guaranteed residential ips and lengthy session durations which sounded perfect on paper. We watched the real time analytics and sure enough the users were coming in from different cities and scrolling down the pages. But then we looked closer at the heatmaps and realized every single user moved their mouse in the exact same pattern before leaving. The investor pulled out after their tech team audited the logs, and my client lost the deal plus the 5k he spent on the package.",

You might see the numbers go up in your analytics for a few days and feel good about it, yet the ad networks have very sophisticated ways of spotting patterns that look unnatural. If you care about the long term health of your domain, you should probably stay away from purchasing visitors completely. It is much safer to focus on creating content that people actually search for, because once you get flagged for invalid activity, it is nearly impossible to get your reputation back with the big networks.",

I wanted to make sure that my family didn't pay the price. So I worked my schedule around them. That meant once everyone was in bed asleep.I got up and I would work for a few hours every night. Then, I would get up very early in the morning to work.And prepare breakfast before leaving for work.\n\nEarly on I found the power list created by Andy Frisella.\n\nOnce the business had traction, and I was working it full time in late year 3 i started making my list of five action items to do every day. That list can be personal family or business. And usually as a combination of all three.\n\nWhen i've knocked out my five things for the day, then i've won the day and I can choose what to do with the rest of my time.\n\nIn year ten now, currently that's how I live. I sleep until I wake up. I have breakfast with my family every morning. Then I start my day. I'm usually home in the late afternoon.\n\nThere are seasons where things are busier. I have a huge inventory order arriving tomorrow. So today i'm preparing everything in the warehouse to receive it. Once it arrives, I will check everything in and stock it on the shelves. Then, I'll fill all the back orders that i've acquired. Ship out any new first orders for the day.And onboard any new customers. Then I'll go home. \n\nBut I understand that tomorrow might be a fifteen hour day or longer. I will work until the job is done. Because if not, it would make the next day harder.\n\nThe big thing is, if you have something that needs to get done, you finish it. If tomorrow is going to be a very long day. Then, I will probably have breakfast with the family and I will come home for dinner and play with my children.And hang out with my wife until they're all in bed.And then I'll come back up to the warehouse and work all night if I have to. My family won't know because I will be there cooking breakfast in the morning.",

It's not really that it's a day-to-day grind, because if you're pushing hard through work that feels terrible, then the work you're creating is probably terrible too.\n\nI think the two big things I've learned about the software businesses are:\n\n1. That it's about education rather than 'hard work'. Building expertise is the part that takes a long time. Once you know how to do something, doing it is trivial, but if you don't know how to do something, no amount of hard work will help you until you do.\n\n2. That the difficult part is like an ultra-marathon, not like a sprint. It's really hard, but not in the sense that you're pushing yourself to the absolute max for a month - more like you have to sustain a good pace for years and not quit, even when some moments are hard. If you sprint, you just burn yourself out, and the whole thing ends up taking longer. Patience is more important than speed.\n\nThe more you can get to be great at what you do through really challenging real-world side projects or realistic experience before starting a business, the better. I probably should have done more of that before starting my business, but I guess learning the hard way is better than not learning at all.",

Year two I was able to hire a bookkeeping service which cut out 4 days of busywork a month. Every Friday was my catch up on books day and a bookkeeper could do it in a tenth that time, so hiring out was amazing. I also brought on a partner who needed support all the time at first, so that was a lot. I also was always bumpy on cash flow. It was stressful going from having 50K in the business checking to needing to hold off on paying ourselves because of cash flow. High growth does that. \n\nSince October though, I’ve really slowed down my sales grind and things keep coming my way, I have a reoccurring revenue so I’m really set so long as I don’t start suddenly losing business, and if I keep adding, I need to hire soon. I’m paying myself around 200K, so that’s nice, and my business checking has been in the lower 6 figures all year. \n\nI honestly thought it would take at least another 1-2 years to get to this point, definitely was not expecting by end of year 1 to be stable, end of year two to be making more, and looking ahead, I may need to hire this year.",

Depending on the business, long hours can be expected. As others have said here, part of that is sometimes lack of control though. Not setting a closing time for the business, or setting up processes to limit the amount of calls if you did want the business open 24 hours. But at that rate, clients should be paying a higher subscription to get you available 24 hours, at which point with the extra cash you could hire someone else to answer the phones and do smaller tasks for clients when they can",

      "text": "I wanted to share a quick reality check for any founders currently stuck in the dead silence phase. For the first two months of my SaaS, I fell into the trap of chasing social media virality. I was posting on X and Reddit every single day, and while I’d get a tiny spike of traffic, it would vanish the moment I stopped.\n\nI realized I was building on sand. Google didn't trust my domain, my feature pages weren't indexing, and I had zero organic momentum.\n\nThe Authority Floor Strategy\n\nI decided to stop the shouting in the wind strategy and focus on building what I call an Authority Floor. Instead of looking for a hack, I spent a full week doing the most boring, unscalable work possible: manual directory submissions.\n\nHere is exactly what that grind looked like:  \n\\->  I vetted 50 high-DR (Domain Rating) directories where the links were mostly dofollow.   \n\\->  I didn't use any automation tools.   \n\\->  I manually submitted to 5-10 sites per day over a week so it looked natural to Google's crawlers.   \n\\->  I wrote unique descriptions for every single submission so it didn't look like a copy-paste job.  \n\\-> It took me 30+ hours of tedious research and data entry.\n\n**The Results**  \nAbout three weeks after I finished the grind, the needle finally started moving.\n\nActive Users - 10k   \nTotal Views - 19k  \nSearch Impressions - 2.84k  \nDomain Rating Jump - 0 to 21 gradually  \n  \n**The Business Lesson I learnt is:**  \nMost founders spend all their time trying to find an AI tool to automate their growth, but sometimes the best move is to just sit down and do the manual work that doesn't scale. Building that initial trust with Google gave me a foundation that actually stays alive even when I’m not active on social media.  \n  \nIf you're stuck at zero, stop looking for a shortcut and start building your foundation.\n\nI’m happy to answer any questions about the specific directories or the slow-drip strategy if you're struggling with indexing!",

I do have some third party experience of this (and was nosy enough to ask how they sorted it) so hope it helps.\n\nTrampoline parks sit in a small, specialist insurance category. Most retail agents literally cannot place the risk, so they either say no immediately or throw out a defensive quote hoping you go away. That’s why the numbers feel insane.\n\nAt this point, stop calling general insurance agents.\n\nYou want brokers who already place cover for high risk leisure venues. Trampoline parks, indoor climbing, zip lines, karting, adventure parks. When you speak to them, don’t frame the conversation as “can you insure my trampoline park?”. Instead, position it as “we are opening an indoor leisure venue, equipment installed, safety systems documented, waivers in place, and we are finalising our insurer”. That signals legitimacy and that you’re already past the idea stage.\n\nOn your questions, yes, £70K plus a year is unfortunately not unusual in year one for trampoline parks. It often comes down once you’ve operated safely for a period of time. Waivers help, but they don’t replace proper liability insurance. Extra cover on top of your main policy is common in this industry, but it should be there to protect against worst-case scenarios, not sold to you out of fear.\n\nThe fastest unlock is finding a broker who already has trampoline parks on their books. Ask them directly how many similar venues they insure. If the answer is zero, move on.\n\nA quick AI search gave me:\n\n* **RPS (Risk Placement Services)** Large wholesale broker with a dedicated entertainment and leisure practice. Many retail agents place trampoline risks through them.\n* **AmWINS** One of the biggest specialty wholesalers in the US. They regularly place coverage for indoor amusement, family entertainment centres, and extreme sports.\n* **CRC Group** Another major wholesale broker that places difficult liability risks, including trampoline parks and adventure venues\n\nHope that steadies things a bit, and good luck with the venture",

          "text": "I’m honestly shocked you’d put close to a million dollars into a business like this without locking down insurance first. In high-risk operations like trampoline parks, insurance isn’t a box you check at the end, it’s the thing that determines whether the business is even viable. If you can’t get coverage at a price the numbers can support, the rest of the plan doesn’t really matter.\n\nThat said, the $85k–$140k quotes you’re getting unfortunately aren’t out of line, especially in year one. Trampolines, ninja courses, and kids are about as bad as it gets from an underwriting standpoint. I pay close to that just for liquor liability in one state with aggressive liability laws, and this risk profile scares carriers even more. Early on, 6–10% of gross going to insurance is very real in this space.\n\nAs for waivers, they do help, but nowhere near what people think. They don’t stop lawsuits, they don’t protect you from gross negligence claims, and they’re much weaker when minors are involved. Insurers know all of this, which is why premiums stay high even if your waiver language is solid.\n\nAt this point the question isn’t how you get cheaper insurance, it’s whether this business can survive its actual risk profile. If you can’t stomach year-one insurance costs at this level, there’s a real chance the model doesn’t work the way you think it does. Your only realistic path forward is a specialty broker and surviving long enough to build clean loss history. Otherwise this turns into a very expensive lesson.",

Sure there are now tools like Blobr AI, LocalQ or Ryze AI that can automate reports but to say that they can replace our work is downplaying our role, undermining our experiences. How does AI train itself? By regurgitating information that humans have already done in the past. Hypothetically, if humans were to be replaced, there would come a point where AI wouldn’t be able to offer any sort of new or beneficial suggestions. And who would come to its aid then? So, the next time anyone says that marketing is going to be majorly automated, do enlighten them :)",

I’ve seen too many stories like \"raised $700K pre-seed → burned through it → now stressed out trying to raise again.\" Meanwhile, I just fix bugs, ship small features, talk to customers and grow at my own pace.\n\nWith micro SaaS, you can get to $5K–$20K MRR with high margins, no pressure and total control over your time. You don’t need a team of 20 or a slide deck for every decision. Just a useful product, a few customers who pay and a feedback loop that actually works.\n\nWould love to hear from others building solo or small- how’s it going for you? And if you’re still debating startup vs micro SaaS, happy to share more behind the scenes if helpful",

It’s wild how much sharper your thinking gets when the only metric that matters is: do customers keep paying and telling you what to fix next?\n\nOne thing that helped me was treating my micro SaaS like a portfolio asset, not my entire identity: keep it lean, build slow moats (distribution, relationships, workflow depth), and avoid any feature that adds support burden without lifting ARPU or retention.\n\nFor finding those customers, I lean on Hypefury and Taplio for X/LinkedIn, then Pulse for Reddit in the background to catch people describing the exact pain in real time.

It was one of those moments where everything seemed routine, until it wasn’t.\n\nYou know that feeling when you’re recharging airtime from your bank app and you accidentally add one extra zero, or when you give someone change and only realize later that you were too generous? That was exactly how this started. Somewhere between checking quantities and confirming payment, I placed an order for 4 wheel motorbikes on Alibaba that was far more than I intended.\n\nIn my head, I was ordering 50. In reality, I ordered 500.\n\nBy the time it clicked, the order was already in motion. To soften the blow, my client agreed to take more units than originally planned, which helped. Still, I was left with a significant number of 4 wheel motorbikes sitting comfortably in inventory, waiting for purpose.\n\nInstead of stressing, I decided to absorb it into the business. Slowly, units moved. Bulk buyers came through. Numbers reduced. Today, I’m down to 50. Ironically, the exact number I intended to order in the first place.\n\nFor now, I’m exploring partnerships with organizations that might need bulk purchases before considering single-unit sales. It’s funny how one small mistake can quietly expand your business in ways you never planned.",

However, I’ve seen this '12-hour laptop trap' **hundreds of times in my 15 years as a mentor**. You are currently in what I call the **'Circle of Busyness'**: where you mistake movement for progress.\n\nIn my book, **'Startup Inferno'**, I explain that a productive day isn't defined by how many emails you sent, but by how much you reduced the 'structural friction' of your business.\n\nHere is my advice to change your mindset:\n\n1. **Focus on 'Leverage' tasks:** Writing a blog post is fine, but did it improve your conversion rate? Sending emails is okay, but did it shorten your sales cycle? A productive day is one where you build a 'brick' that stays there forever, not just one where you 'tread water'.\n2. **Stop the 12-hour madness:** After 35 years in global strategy and startups, I can tell you: nobody is truly strategic after the 8th hour of staring at a screen. You are likely building a **'Frankenstein Startup',** adding features or content out of anxiety rather than clear vision.\n3. **The 1-Metric Rule:** Define a productive day by one single metric. For you, it might be: 'Did I talk to one fashion photographer today to understand why they haven't paid yet?' That one call is worth 10 blog posts.\n\nA productive day is when you are closer to a scalable system, not just when you are tired. How many of those 12 hours are spent actually talking to potential users vs. just 'polishing' your tool?",

      "text": "Two months ago I left my job as a frontend developer to build SaaS products full time. I had about €16K saved up. I'm down to €10K now and some days the math keeps me up at night.\n\nI'm not writing this as a success story. I'm writing this because every post I see here is either \"I made $50K MRR in 3 months\" or \"don't give up, keep grinding.\" Nobody talks about what it actualy feels like in the messy middle. So heres the honest version.\n\n\n\n**The situation**\n\nI started with a first SaaS two months ago. Built it, launched it, started seeing some traction through SEO. Not life changing numbers but enough to keep me going. I decided to put it on near autopilot and let organic growth do its thing while I started building a second product like a week ago.\n\nThe logic makes sense on paper: diversify, let SEO compound, build while I still have runway.\n\nThe reality feels very different.\n\n\n\n**What nobody tells you about living on savings**\n\nSome days are genuinely good. I wake up, check my analytics, see growth, feel like I made the right call. I build features, write content, talk to users. I feel alive in a way I never did at a desk job.\n\nThen there are the other days.\n\nThe days where I open my bank account and do the mental math. €10K. Maybe 4 months of bare minimum living. I start thinking about what happens if this doesnt work. I think about going back to applying for frontend jobs, which brings its own anxiety.\n\nHeres the thing nobody talks about: I've been a frontend dev for 6 years. I can build full apps from scratch. But I studied mechanical engineering, learned to code through a bootcamp (Le Wagon), and built my skills by actualy shipping products, not by grinding LeetCode. So when companies send me technical tests, I bomb them. I can build your entire product but I cant reverse a binary tree on a whiteboard.\n\nThat gap between what I can do and what I can prove in a 45 minute coding test is terrifying when its your plan B.\n\n\n\n**What keeps me going**\n\nI have this goal that I come back to when things get dark. I want to live in Sydney. The sun, the ocean, the lifestyle. Every time I think about quitting I picture myself there and I remember why I'm doing this.\n\nIt sounds stupid when I write it down. But having a clear picture of what your building toward, not just \"financial freedom\" or \"be my own boss\" but something specific and vivid, thats the thing that gets me out of bed on the bad days.\n\nThe traction helps too. Its small but its real. And real traction, even tiny, is proof that the idea works. The question is just wether it'll grow fast enough before the savings run out.\n\n\n\n**Where I'm at mentally**\n\nI'm not gonna pretend I have this figured out. Most days I go back and forth between \"this is the best decision I ever made\" and \"I'm an idiot burning through savings on a dream.\" Sometimes both in the same hour.\n\nToday is one of those days where I just want to disappear and quit everything honestly. Ask me again tomorow and I'll probably feel better. Thats kind of how it goes.",

          "text": "The main thing here is you already did the rarest part: you stuck around through the silence instead of rage-quitting or sprinting back to a paycheck at the first wobble.\n\nWhat you’re feeling is exactly what happens when your runway and identity are tied together. Two ideas that helped me:\n\n1) Put hard guardrails on the money. Decide now: “If MRR isn’t at X or trending up by Month Y, I freelance 2–3 days/week.” That turns the fear into a trigger for a plan instead of a fog.\n\n2) Stop treating product #1 as “on autopilot.” Pick one growth motion (SEO, cold outreach, or partnerships) and commit to a small weekly quota: number of articles, DMs, or emails. Momentum compounds way faster than splitting your brain across two half-marketed products.\n\nOn the job front, you can dodge a lot of LeetCode hell by aiming at smaller startups, networking into teams, and showing real projects instead of tests. I’ve landed work that way using my own apps as the portfolio, plus things like Upwork and cold DMs; tools like Ahrefs, Indie Hackers, and Pulse for Reddit help me find where my exact users and potential employers hang out.\n\nMain point: give your fear a job with clear rules, focus on one growth engine, and keep a realistic “back to cashflow” plan so Sydney stays a goal, not an escape fantasy.",

      "text": "&#x200B;\n\nWhen I first started my entrepreneurial journey, I genuinely thought the hardest part would be execution.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe hardest part was finding the right idea.\n\nBefore this, I failed. Not once. Not twice. Five different ventures. Some died quickly, some dragged on longer than they should have, but all of them had one thing in common. I was building things I thought sounded interesting, not things people were actively struggling with.\n\nToday, our tech startup earned its first dollar.\n\nIt is a small amount. Almost symbolic. But if you have been through failure, you know how big that moment feels. That dollar carries more validation than months of motivation.\n\nWhat changed this time was not my work ethic or discipline. It was how I approached the idea itself.\n\nIn the early days of entrepreneurship, choosing the wrong idea is brutally expensive. Not in money, but in time, energy, and belief. You can work hard on the wrong problem and still end up nowhere. That lesson took me years to learn.\n\nThis time, I focused on something very unglamorous. A problem people were already complaining about. Something boring enough that no one was pitching it with buzzwords. Something that existed whether or not I built a startup around it.\n\nI actually came across the idea while searching on Google and stumbling onto StartupIdeasDB. I do not even know if I am allowed to share links here, so I will avoid that. But what stood out to me was not how exciting the ideas sounded. It was how practical they were. Many of them were rooted in real frustrations people already talk about online.\n\nThat flipped a switch for me.\n\nInstead of asking “Is this idea innovative?”, I started asking “Are people already annoyed enough to pay for a solution?”\n\nSolving problems people complain about openly is far more powerful than chasing ideas that sound impressive in founder circles. Fancy ideas get applause. Boring ideas get revenue. This holds true whether you are building B2B or B2C.\n\nLooking back, my failed ventures were not failures of effort. They were failures of judgment. I was trying to invent demand instead of listening to it.\n\nThis experience taught me something I wish I had understood earlier. Your job as an early stage founder is not to sound smart. It is to reduce pain. Quietly. Consistently. In a way people are already asking for.\n\nToday’s first dollar did not come from brilliance. It came from humility. From accepting that the best ideas are often already hiding in plain sight, inside problems people complain about every single day.\n\nIf you are early in your journey, learn this sooner than I did. The right idea will save you years.",

Wanted to share the honest numbers and lessons.\n\n**The numbers:**\n- 57,000 active users (2025)\n- 87,000 annual page views\n- 375% year-over-year growth\n- 3,500+ returning visitors\n- $0 revenue (never monetized)\n\n**What it is:**\nA Next.js platform that aggregates audio industry news, product listings, and specs. Think \"what's happening in hi-fi\" in one place. Built with a custom data pipeline that auto-collects content.\n\n**Tech stack:** Next.js, React, Node.js, automated data collection pipeline\n\n**What went right:**\n- Found a real niche — audiophiles actively searching for gear info\n- Growth was organic, no paid marketing\n- Built solid tech infrastructure\n\n**What went wrong:**\n- Never prioritized monetization (classic developer trap)\n- Spent too much time on features, not enough on business model\n- Running it solo meant no accountability on the revenue side\n- Life priorities shifted — can't give it the time it deserves\n\n**Lessons for this community:**\n1. Build monetization into v1, not \"someday\"\n2. 57K users means nothing if you can't convert them\n3. A solo project needs revenue milestones, not just feature milestones\n4. Know when to pass the torch — someone with ad sales experience could monetize this quickly\n\n**Why I'm selling:**\nI simply don't have the time anymore. The platform works, the audience is there, but it needs someone who can focus on the business side. Hosting is ~$100/month self-hosted.\n\n**What's included:**\nFull codebase, domain (hifi.fan), all content, data pipeline, user base, documentation.\n\nIf you're interested or have questions, DM me or email cajoy@hifi.fan.\n\nHappy to share more details with serious inquiries.",

When you’re deep in building, monetization always feels like “I’ll do it once it’s bigger.”\n\nOut of curiosity — did users ever ask for anything that hinted at willingness to pay?

The \"build audience first, monetize later\" trap catches so many of us.\n\nI did the same thing with my first product—focused entirely on user growth because it felt productive and validating. 6 months in, I had thousands of visitors but no revenue model that actually worked. The mental shift from \"how do I get more users?\" to \"how do I make money from users?\" is harder than it sounds.\n\nYour lesson about \"revenue milestones, not feature milestones\" hits hard. I had feature checklists. I had user growth charts. What I didn't have was a spreadsheet that said \"by month 3, we need $500 MRR or we change something fundamental.\"\n\nThe brutal truth: users don't automatically convert to revenue just because you have lots of them. 57K audiophiles is an incredible niche audience—affluent, passionate, always buying gear. The fact that it generated $0 isn't a product failure, it's a business model failure. And those are much easier to fix when you catch them early.\n\nFor anyone reading this: if you can't answer \"how will this make money in the first 90 days?\" before you write your first line of code, you're not building a business yet. You're building a project. Both are fine, but know which one you're doing.\n\nGood luck with the sale.

      "text": "So still most people in Kenya still rely on mobile data bundles for internet access and in all honesty Safaricom (and \"friends\") absolutely milk that system. Bundles expire, speeds drop, and you’re paying more for less. Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is cheaper, more convenient, and way more scalable… if you can get it close to people.\n\nI live in a fairly remote area, but I’m close to a market that’s still developing. One day a friend visited me and casually suggested I try running a Wi-Fi hotspot around there. At first, I didn’t take it seriously. I assumed everyone would just use Safaricom bundles for those unable  to buy wifi installation services,so I didn’t see why anyone would pay for local Wi-Fi.\n\nAfter thinking about it for a while, I decided to try anyway purely as an experiment.\n\nI didn’t start big or spend much. I used a second-hand MikroTik router my friend sold me, added a basic Tenda router, and connected everything to my existing Airtel 5G  smart box, which I already pay for monthly. We ran a long Ethernet cable outside, mounted the equipment in a small box, and pointed the antennas toward the market. That was the entire setup.\n\nOn the first day, from around 10am to midnight, I made about 1,200 KES. I assumed it was just people being curious and trying something new. But the same thing happened the next day, and the day after that. On slower days I make around 1,500 KES, and on good days it goes up to about 2,000 KES.Crazy!!\n\nWithin about a week, I had recovered all my initial costs. That’s when it stopped feeling like a small side experiment and started feeling like a real opportunity.\n\nLater, a friend showed me his own dashboard. He averages around 15,000 KES per day. He also mentioned others who earn much more, but those setups are larger fiber connections, multiple locations, and years of gradual expansion. That’s when I realized this business doesn’t grow overnight. It grows with infrastructure, patience, and consistency.\n\nThe hardest part for me wasn’t the money or the hardware. It was learning how to configure MikroTik properly and setting up the billing system. Without guidance, I'd probably would have quit early out of frustration. Once everything was configured correctly, though, the system became fairly stable and mostly runs itself.\n\nI’m not posting this to sell anything or claim I’ve figured everything out. I just wanted to share an honest experience for anyone who’s curious . You can start small, learn as you go, and grow slowly while doing things properly over time.\n\nEstimated capital (based on my setup)\n\nMikroTik router  5,000 KES\n\nTenda router 1,500 KES\n\nBilling system (iterativebilling.com)  1,000 KES\n\nAirtel 5G internet 3,000 KES\n\nElectricity 1,500 KES per month\n\nTotal: 12,000 KES\n\nThis could definitely grow into something bigger, but it would require an big investors for better equipment, stronger infrastructure, and proper licensing. I’m still researching the regulatory side and long term setup. With the right investment and planning, this could be a solid business, especially in underserved areas.\n\n(I decided to post this here again in case a potential investor missed it the first time. During the previous post, there was a lot of curiosity and I genuinely enjoyed answering questions and engaging with everyone. However, I did not secure an investor who could provide solid backing.\n\nI am sharing it again with the hope of connecting with someone interested in supporting the project.)\n\nEdit: you see my current plan is to scale carefully from a single source point: start with 8–10 high-quality access points for local coverage, then use high-performance PowerBeam M5s and NanoStations for backhaul. That way I can push wifi signals over several kilometers, effectively linking the underserved spots without those massive infrastructure investments. The idea is to gradually expand, fund each step from the revenue, and build a stable, scalable network.\nIt’s a small start, but I think targeting those underserved gaps strategically is exactly how a small ISP like this can grow without directly competing with the big players.\n\nScenario;When I get at least 1000 users everyday,  with each paying as low 40kes everyday , that is 40,000 kes a day and 1,200,000 kes monthly revenue.Thats huge.\n\nAs always, feel free to ask any questions if you find it interesting. \n\nHappy Valentines day to y'all.\n\n......",

I’ve read the project goals and how they intend to expand digital access, but in reality they’re mostly focused on public institutions and large contracts tied to big infrastructure builds, not small private MSMEs like a local ISP startup yet, which makes it very hard for someone like me to benefit directly.I'm  trying to set up/scale slowly in underserved, semi developing area that I currently living in.\n\nAlso, Kenyan grant programs in general tend to be very competitive and bureaucratic  as I said  you often need connections or capacity in grant writing just to stand even a small chance, and I’ve seen people on other programs basically give up because the process is so slow and opaque, it kind of hopeless reallying on them.I kind stand better chances posting here\n\nSo yeah, I appreciate the suggestions, but right now the challenge isn’t that I haven’t heard of these options it’s that accessing them as a small business \"founder\" still feels like an uphill battle without links into those networks.",

Here’s how it actually works: when a user connects to the wifi , they are redirected to a portal page showing different packages with set time limits. Once they purchase a package let's say, 50kes the system automatically grants access for that duration. When the time runs out, access is cut off automatically. The system handles everything behind the scenes, including preventing sharing( I can work around this by registering Mac address for othere extra devices like in a family setting though), limiting simultaneous connections, and tracking usage. So each user’s session is controlled and managed automatically no passwords needed.",

If you're doing high volume residential might be worth it, but for a small team it felt like overkill and the cost didn't make sense.\n\njobber also well known, way cleaner interface, made more sense, scheduling worked great, invoicing was easy, support actually answered my questions fast, but it is not built or home services specifically just service businesses in general, customization is limited, like you can't really change invoice templates much, it is reliable but feels pretty generic and people say once you hit a certain size you outgrow it but it's expensive enough that you'd expect it to scale better.\n\nbizzen is way newer, only heard about it from another mate, it's specifically built for the admin stuff that kills your time, I can create estimates by just talking while I'm driving no add-ons or per-user fees, downside is it doesn't do crew dispatching or project management like the big platforms, it's really just focused on automating admin work, if you need complex scheduling this isn't it, but if you're solo or small team, it makes sense.\n\nSo imo housecall may work for bigger residential operations, jobber is a good option for small to medium teams that want reliable basics and bizzen is for solo or small contractors drowning in admin work, want automation but don't need fancy project management.",

New vendor portal shows up? We tag each question with IDs and just crosswalk to existing answers instead of rewriting.

Tools like Vanta/Drata help automate some evidence pulls, same with G2 Track-style asset inventories; Pulse has actually been useful for us to mine and organize Reddit threads about buyer concerns so our standard responses hit the right language.\n\nPoint is: build a reusable security library and make each new review just mapping, not rewriting.",

If neither works, you've got information that saves you months.\n\nWeek 4 is the pivot point. By now you know if you're chasing something people want or just something interesting to you.

I've managed companies. I've managed large sales teams.I've been an employee... Nope.\n\nIs it more difficult the way that I choose to do business?? Absolute at times. Yesterday was a good case in point.\n\nI had a few million dollars worth of inventory land at my warehouse. I unloaded it with a forklift, then I broke open all the wooden crates and unloaded everything (thousands of 45#-65# boxes) into sorted piles by part number on the ground and then took inventory. Then, I rearranged and stocked the entire warehouse. So the new inventory would go in the back, and the old stuff would be in the front. I've replaced labels on all the boxes and made it the way I like it. I picked thirty seven back.Order orders from new customers because I picked all first orders. A package them and shipped them. Then, I cleaned up the warehouse and went home at midnight. Woke up at five a m. Went to my warehouse and loaded up deliveries to a handful of local customers ive had since the beginning and hand delivered all of their orders. It was about a 6 hour trip. While driving, I took new orders from new customers. I received payments. \n\nI got back to my shop and I had six new customer orders, so I onboarded them and picked packed and shipped their orders. Sent their invoices and tracking number and then received their payments and sent out receipts. Update my sales board for the day and my numbers for the week and then month.\n\nNow my day starts. All that other stuff was just because of the inventory arriving yesterday. Moments like these only happen a couple times a year. When they happen though it's a burn, the boat's moment you work until you're done. This is why I get paid the big bucks. \n\nI could have hired someday labor. I could have shipped the orders instead of delivering them. I can automate even first orders through my 3PL including the onboarding process and payment process. \n\nThis was my vision of how my company would run, and it works well. I like the hectic crazy times a few times a year. It reminds me of all the beginning years when it was every day.\n\nSo, yes, you can build a business as big as you want. We should break nine figures this year.And that's nine figures, top line and bottom line. Without another soul employed. You'll have to put systems in place. You'll have to be the most proficient person in every role necessary at all times, with skill sets and experience to backet. \n\nI love business. It's the only life or death game left for us humans.",

I tried to have a guy that worked me in the warehouse in year four, but I realized I don't want to run a daycare. \n\nI do keep a warehouse at our home base here in texas. Some of its economics.It's a lot more affordable to feed the three p.L facilities pallets as needed instead of paying for storage space. I bought the warehouse for less than a hundred grand on a tax foreclosure auction. We only used one bay, the middle bay is our library and our outdoor camping gear storage, and the third bay is an apartment with everything that a home would have, and then there's the hallway and the bathroom.\n\nI do all the roles.So sales is one of the primary roles.I handle day to day. I take all first orders and I pick pack and ship them.And then I onboard them into our system, when I send the invoice and tracking on that first order.\n\nI broke my personal record this last week with thirteen thousand dollars in one day in new orders. \n\nIt doesn't matter if I do fifty dollars or thirteen thousand dollars in one day.Because our residuals range between $150k-$250k a day. We did break three hundred thousand dollars for the first time in 10 years in one day, this week. The primary reason for it was due to back order that head built up over the last few months. I don't think we'll hit three hundred thousand in a day again.Until end of year or next year.\n\nSo yes, when we were doing seven million dollars, that was where I broke, and I chose the three p l system. I was picking and packing orders fifteen hours a day.Seven days a week and doing no sales, no payment management.No, inventory management, much less managing our oem scheduled release purchase orders factory to factory, for our  the truck and bus manufacturers, which takes time and creativity managing and scrubbing bills of lading from 8 countries.\n\nThis may be our first 9 figure year. I'm optimistic, but not overly confident.Because when you get to this level, it's a very, very different game.And it's all new to me.",

You can also lean into automation and systems rather than managing staff.\n\nHiring is one way to scale, but it’s not the only way.

What worked for me was hiring just one person for the stuff i really didn't want to do (like admin work or customer support), and I used a talent matching service that pre-vetted candidates so I didn't have to sort through dozens of resumes. Turns out delegation doesn't mean babysitting if you hire the right person and give them clear expectations upfront. Alternatively, you could go the solo route with passive income stuff (courses, digital products, etc.) but tbh even those require some level of help eventually if you want real scale.",

      "text": "Last year, my wife and I were talking about how boring the internet and our phones are now compared to what it use to be like. We were talking about what was missing, what made it fun. It was that feeling of discovery, of something new every time you \"logged on.\" I thought about this for a while and finally started building a silly fun idea.\n\n  \n**A worldwide, anonymous question of the day app.** If you answer the question, then your postcard gets sent to a random person, and you get a random person's card. Each postcard gets sent out with a stamp of your country.\n\nEvery day, you open the app for a few minutes, collect a new stamp and postcard, read a little about a new culture or perspective, take a few moments to write something, then close the app and forget about it.  Quick, simple, joyful.\n\n  \nI finally launched it **2 weeks ago** on the Apple App Store. Since then, I've had over **500 downloads, 25+ countries participate, a peak day of 87 users**, and since then a fairly consistent 30-50 daily users. The reactions I've gotten from folks have been exactly spot on for the feeling I wanted to create, and the reason I made the app. I've got to read some enlightening and surprising cards and learned about different cultures in the process.\n\nI'm not sure where it will go or where I'll take it yet. I've already put a few UI updates out with more features and fixes. I just want to slowly build the daily active users and find people who really love it.\n\nIf you have an iPhone and want to check it out, DM me for a link!",

I have a minimum of 50 words to send a card, and so far I haven't really seen much mischief around copying/pasting or just typing gibberish to hit the minimum.\n\nRight now there's about 4-5 countries that always have the most respondents, but I think it's too early to pull any trends out from that. I think it very much depends on the prompt.\n\nI am very interested to see if any trends emerge on prompt type (I've broken them down into about 7-8 categories of prompt) or days of the week.
