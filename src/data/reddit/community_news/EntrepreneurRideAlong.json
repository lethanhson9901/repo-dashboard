      "text": "I wasted like $2k on lead lists before I figured this out. Posting in case anyone else is burning money the same way I was.\n\nBackground: bootstrapped b2b saas, tiny budget, couldn't afford SDRs. Was doing all outbound myself.\n\nBought lists from apollo, clearbit, zoominfo trials, you name it. Response rates were embarrassing. Like 1-2%. Started thinking outbound just \"doesn't work for our space.\"\n\nThen I had a dumb realization that honestly should've been obvious way sooner.\n\n**The people I want to sell to are already telling me who they are.**\n\nThey're following my competitors on linkedin.\n\nThey're commenting on posts about the exact problem I solve.\n\nThey're engaging with content in my niche every single day.\n\nWhy am I paying for some scraped list of \"CMOs in the US\" when I can just... look at who's actively interested in my space?\n\n**What I started doing:**\n\n1) Found the 5 biggest competitors in my space. Looked at their linkedin company page followers. Filtered by job title. These people literally followed a company that does what I do. They're not cold.\n\n2) Found \\~10 people who post content about my problem space. Looked at who's commenting and engaging. These people are self-identifying as caring about this topic.\n\nThen I just reached out. Super simple message like \"saw you engage with \\[x\\]'s post about \\[topic\\], working on something related, thought you might have thoughts\"\n\n**What changed:**\n\nOld way (bought lists): \\~2% reply rate, most replies were \"not interested\" or \"remove me\"\n\nNew way: 35-40% reply rate, and these people actually want to talk because they're already thinking about this stuff\n\nWent from mass outreach to like 30-40 hyper targeted messages per week. Way less volume but 10x the results.\n\n**The boring logistics part:**\n\nYou can do this manually (I did for the first few weeks, it sucked). There's some tools that scrape linkedin engagers - I've tried a few, won't shill any specific ones here but just google \"linkedin engagement scraper\" and you'll find options. Some let you automate the outreach too which saves time.\n\nMain point isn't the tools though. It's the mindset shift.\n\nStop trying to find people who MIGHT be interested.\n\nStart finding people who already ARE interested.\n\nThey're right there. Engaging with your competitors. Commenting on relevant content. Following pages in your space.",

I wanted to make sure that my family didn't pay the price. So I worked my schedule around them. That meant once everyone was in bed asleep.I got up and I would work for a few hours every night. Then, I would get up very early in the morning to work.And prepare breakfast before leaving for work.\n\nEarly on I found the power list created by Andy Frisella.\n\nOnce the business had traction, and I was working it full time in late year 3 i started making my list of five action items to do every day. That list can be personal family or business. And usually as a combination of all three.\n\nWhen i've knocked out my five things for the day, then i've won the day and I can choose what to do with the rest of my time.\n\nIn year ten now, currently that's how I live. I sleep until I wake up. I have breakfast with my family every morning. Then I start my day. I'm usually home in the late afternoon.\n\nThere are seasons where things are busier. I have a huge inventory order arriving tomorrow. So today i'm preparing everything in the warehouse to receive it. Once it arrives, I will check everything in and stock it on the shelves. Then, I'll fill all the back orders that i've acquired. Ship out any new first orders for the day.And onboard any new customers. Then I'll go home. \n\nBut I understand that tomorrow might be a fifteen hour day or longer. I will work until the job is done. Because if not, it would make the next day harder.\n\nThe big thing is, if you have something that needs to get done, you finish it. If tomorrow is going to be a very long day. Then, I will probably have breakfast with the family and I will come home for dinner and play with my children.And hang out with my wife until they're all in bed.And then I'll come back up to the warehouse and work all night if I have to. My family won't know because I will be there cooking breakfast in the morning.",

It's not really that it's a day-to-day grind, because if you're pushing hard through work that feels terrible, then the work you're creating is probably terrible too.\n\nI think the two big things I've learned about the software businesses are:\n\n1. That it's about education rather than 'hard work'. Building expertise is the part that takes a long time. Once you know how to do something, doing it is trivial, but if you don't know how to do something, no amount of hard work will help you until you do.\n\n2. That the difficult part is like an ultra-marathon, not like a sprint. It's really hard, but not in the sense that you're pushing yourself to the absolute max for a month - more like you have to sustain a good pace for years and not quit, even when some moments are hard. If you sprint, you just burn yourself out, and the whole thing ends up taking longer. Patience is more important than speed.\n\nThe more you can get to be great at what you do through really challenging real-world side projects or realistic experience before starting a business, the better. I probably should have done more of that before starting my business, but I guess learning the hard way is better than not learning at all.",

Year two I was able to hire a bookkeeping service which cut out 4 days of busywork a month. Every Friday was my catch up on books day and a bookkeeper could do it in a tenth that time, so hiring out was amazing. I also brought on a partner who needed support all the time at first, so that was a lot. I also was always bumpy on cash flow. It was stressful going from having 50K in the business checking to needing to hold off on paying ourselves because of cash flow. High growth does that. \n\nSince October though, I’ve really slowed down my sales grind and things keep coming my way, I have a reoccurring revenue so I’m really set so long as I don’t start suddenly losing business, and if I keep adding, I need to hire soon. I’m paying myself around 200K, so that’s nice, and my business checking has been in the lower 6 figures all year. \n\nI honestly thought it would take at least another 1-2 years to get to this point, definitely was not expecting by end of year 1 to be stable, end of year two to be making more, and looking ahead, I may need to hire this year.",

Depending on the business, long hours can be expected. As others have said here, part of that is sometimes lack of control though. Not setting a closing time for the business, or setting up processes to limit the amount of calls if you did want the business open 24 hours. But at that rate, clients should be paying a higher subscription to get you available 24 hours, at which point with the extra cash you could hire someone else to answer the phones and do smaller tasks for clients when they can",

I would sell this info for $99 but no one would buy it because there is really no secret to it.\n\n1.\t⁠Worked 14 years (steady 9-5 w2 job)without a vacation or a off day. Literally missed 6 hours of work the day my son was born and another day when I had the swine flu. Saved money\n\n2.\t⁠Picked a industry that created the most millionaires and spent every waking second learning as much as I could about the industry and all the different niches and verticals. (Real estate)\n\n3.\t⁠Found the most successful people in my area and emailed them asking how I could provide value to them in exchange for learning and eventually having opportunities to be apart of deals.\n\n4.\t⁠Obtained a real estate license and agreed to write offers for a group of investors, I would receive $750 at closing and credit the rest of my commission to the investors. Wrote thousands of offers and pocketed over $100k cash, credited close to a million to the investors.\n\n5.\t⁠Learned what the investors looked for, who they used for lending and contractors. Started to buy my own properties and do joint ventures with the investors group.\n\n6.\t⁠Found contractors in the service industry who were great operators but terrible at business. Bought into their companies and assembled a team to handle the backend. (Hvac, roofing, roll off dumpsters).\n\n7.\t⁠Built a portfolio of 19 rental houses that I paid on average $125k for. When the market spiked I sold 14 of the properties for a average of $310k per unit.\n\n8.\t⁠Paid off the 5 rental properties and that cash flow pays my living expenses. Dumped the rest of the money into a self strorage deal, and short term rentals. At the age of 38 my net worth was north of 4 million and my monthly cash flow from all properties and businesses is over $20k a month with some months hitting $60k. It took 20 years and a lot of 80 work weeks to build “passive income”. Looking back I regret not spending time with my kids and family. Having money is nice but relationships, family, health, and memories is a lot better. The more you make the more you spend. My life and problems are still similar to when I was paycheck to paycheck, I just have nicer cars, house, and am able to do whatever I want whenever I want. Which gets boring quicker than you would think. The market has changed so much I no longer invest in real estate, have seen a lot of people over leverage and lose it all. Hope this rant helps someone. Key point to take away is just find something and go all in, but also live your life and cherish your family, friends, health",

For the first ~14 years I was still working 9–5 and doing real estate at nights and weekends. The only part that really felt “all in” was the later stage when I already had some capital, experience, and a network.\n\t2.\tI didn’t quit and go unpaid. I was extremely conservative early on. I saved aggressively from my job, lived way below my means, and used that as my runway. Real estate was something I layered on top, not something I jumped into blind. Time was the bigger constraint than money — it meant a lot of late nights, weekends, and saying no to almost everything else.\n\t3.\tEverything overlapped. Learning never stopped. Writing offers, networking, finding contractors, investing, buying into businesses — it all happened in parallel once momentum started. The “steps” only look neat in hindsight. In reality it was messy, lots of trial and error, and plenty of dead ends.\n\nBiggest thing I’d stress: there was no master plan. Just consistent effort over a long time, and being willing to look stupid, work more than everyone else, and stick around long enough for compounding to kick in.",

I really don’t want fake clicks or bots that bounce immediately, so I want real website traffic. I’m hoping to find something that sends visitors who look natural, browse my website, and show up properly in analytics, since that is important for getting approved by ad networks.\n\nIt also matters to me that I can buy traffic and have an option to choose visitor locations, and that the traffic arrives gradually instead of flooding in all at once, so it keeps looking realistic. If anyone has tested a site that held up long term without causing penalties or strange ranking drops, I’d really appreciate any recommendations.",

He found this expensive vendor that guaranteed residential ips and lengthy session durations which sounded perfect on paper. We watched the real time analytics and sure enough the users were coming in from different cities and scrolling down the pages. But then we looked closer at the heatmaps and realized every single user moved their mouse in the exact same pattern before leaving. The investor pulled out after their tech team audited the logs, and my client lost the deal plus the 5k he spent on the package.",

You might see the numbers go up in your analytics for a few days and feel good about it, yet the ad networks have very sophisticated ways of spotting patterns that look unnatural. If you care about the long term health of your domain, you should probably stay away from purchasing visitors completely. It is much safer to focus on creating content that people actually search for, because once you get flagged for invalid activity, it is nearly impossible to get your reputation back with the big networks.",

      "text": "I wanted to share a quick reality check for any founders currently stuck in the dead silence phase. For the first two months of my SaaS, I fell into the trap of chasing social media virality. I was posting on X and Reddit every single day, and while I’d get a tiny spike of traffic, it would vanish the moment I stopped.\n\nI realized I was building on sand. Google didn't trust my domain, my feature pages weren't indexing, and I had zero organic momentum.\n\nThe Authority Floor Strategy\n\nI decided to stop the shouting in the wind strategy and focus on building what I call an Authority Floor. Instead of looking for a hack, I spent a full week doing the most boring, unscalable work possible: manual directory submissions.\n\nHere is exactly what that grind looked like:  \n\\->  I vetted 50 high-DR (Domain Rating) directories where the links were mostly dofollow.   \n\\->  I didn't use any automation tools.   \n\\->  I manually submitted to 5-10 sites per day over a week so it looked natural to Google's crawlers.   \n\\->  I wrote unique descriptions for every single submission so it didn't look like a copy-paste job.  \n\\-> It took me 30+ hours of tedious research and data entry.\n\n**The Results**  \nAbout three weeks after I finished the grind, the needle finally started moving.\n\nActive Users - 10k   \nTotal Views - 19k  \nSearch Impressions - 2.84k  \nDomain Rating Jump - 0 to 21 gradually  \n  \n**The Business Lesson I learnt is:**  \nMost founders spend all their time trying to find an AI tool to automate their growth, but sometimes the best move is to just sit down and do the manual work that doesn't scale. Building that initial trust with Google gave me a foundation that actually stays alive even when I’m not active on social media.  \n  \nIf you're stuck at zero, stop looking for a shortcut and start building your foundation.\n\nI’m happy to answer any questions about the specific directories or the slow-drip strategy if you're struggling with indexing!",

When someone admits they 'simulate dashboards' for marketing, they are admitting their product isn't dropshipping, it's selling an illusion to the desperate.\n\nUsing my **Curling analogy**: these gurus are trying to convince you the stone is in the center of the house by painting a target around where it landed. But real business is about the **'Sweeping',** the hard, unglamorous work of removing friction from operations, logistics, and margins.\n\nReal entrepreneurs don't show off 'simulated' dashboards; they obsess over **Operational Validation**. They know that if the structure underneath is fake, the 'success' will collapse the moment a real market breeze hits it.\n\n**Question for you:** Now that you’ve seen behind the curtain, what’s the one 'boring' metric you look for now to tell if a founder is actually the real deal?",

I do have some third party experience of this (and was nosy enough to ask how they sorted it) so hope it helps.\n\nTrampoline parks sit in a small, specialist insurance category. Most retail agents literally cannot place the risk, so they either say no immediately or throw out a defensive quote hoping you go away. That’s why the numbers feel insane.\n\nAt this point, stop calling general insurance agents.\n\nYou want brokers who already place cover for high risk leisure venues. Trampoline parks, indoor climbing, zip lines, karting, adventure parks. When you speak to them, don’t frame the conversation as “can you insure my trampoline park?”. Instead, position it as “we are opening an indoor leisure venue, equipment installed, safety systems documented, waivers in place, and we are finalising our insurer”. That signals legitimacy and that you’re already past the idea stage.\n\nOn your questions, yes, £70K plus a year is unfortunately not unusual in year one for trampoline parks. It often comes down once you’ve operated safely for a period of time. Waivers help, but they don’t replace proper liability insurance. Extra cover on top of your main policy is common in this industry, but it should be there to protect against worst-case scenarios, not sold to you out of fear.\n\nThe fastest unlock is finding a broker who already has trampoline parks on their books. Ask them directly how many similar venues they insure. If the answer is zero, move on.\n\nA quick AI search gave me:\n\n* **RPS (Risk Placement Services)** Large wholesale broker with a dedicated entertainment and leisure practice. Many retail agents place trampoline risks through them.\n* **AmWINS** One of the biggest specialty wholesalers in the US. They regularly place coverage for indoor amusement, family entertainment centres, and extreme sports.\n* **CRC Group** Another major wholesale broker that places difficult liability risks, including trampoline parks and adventure venues\n\nHope that steadies things a bit, and good luck with the venture",

          "text": "I’m honestly shocked you’d put close to a million dollars into a business like this without locking down insurance first. In high-risk operations like trampoline parks, insurance isn’t a box you check at the end, it’s the thing that determines whether the business is even viable. If you can’t get coverage at a price the numbers can support, the rest of the plan doesn’t really matter.\n\nThat said, the $85k–$140k quotes you’re getting unfortunately aren’t out of line, especially in year one. Trampolines, ninja courses, and kids are about as bad as it gets from an underwriting standpoint. I pay close to that just for liquor liability in one state with aggressive liability laws, and this risk profile scares carriers even more. Early on, 6–10% of gross going to insurance is very real in this space.\n\nAs for waivers, they do help, but nowhere near what people think. They don’t stop lawsuits, they don’t protect you from gross negligence claims, and they’re much weaker when minors are involved. Insurers know all of this, which is why premiums stay high even if your waiver language is solid.\n\nAt this point the question isn’t how you get cheaper insurance, it’s whether this business can survive its actual risk profile. If you can’t stomach year-one insurance costs at this level, there’s a real chance the model doesn’t work the way you think it does. Your only realistic path forward is a specialty broker and surviving long enough to build clean loss history. Otherwise this turns into a very expensive lesson.",

And I can hardly recall using the same strategy for more than 2 clients. Each one has their own flair, their own style or a “human touch” as i like to say that makes their marketing unique. Sure there are now tools like Blobr AI, LocalQ or Ryze AI that can automate reports but to say that they can replace our work is downplaying our role, undermining our experiences. How does AI train itself? By regurgitating information that humans have already done in the past. Hypothetically, if humans were to be replaced, there would come a point where AI wouldn’t be able to offer any sort of new or beneficial suggestions. And who would come to its aid then? So, the next time anyone says that marketing is going to be majorly automated, do enlighten them :)",

      "text": "&#x200B;\n\nWhen I first started my entrepreneurial journey, I genuinely thought the hardest part would be execution.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe hardest part was finding the right idea.\n\nBefore this, I failed. Not once. Not twice. Five different ventures. Some died quickly, some dragged on longer than they should have, but all of them had one thing in common. I was building things I thought sounded interesting, not things people were actively struggling with.\n\nToday, our tech startup earned its first dollar.\n\nIt is a small amount. Almost symbolic. But if you have been through failure, you know how big that moment feels. That dollar carries more validation than months of motivation.\n\nWhat changed this time was not my work ethic or discipline. It was how I approached the idea itself.\n\nIn the early days of entrepreneurship, choosing the wrong idea is brutally expensive. Not in money, but in time, energy, and belief. You can work hard on the wrong problem and still end up nowhere. That lesson took me years to learn.\n\nThis time, I focused on something very unglamorous. A problem people were already complaining about. Something boring enough that no one was pitching it with buzzwords. Something that existed whether or not I built a startup around it.\n\nI actually came across the idea while searching on Google and stumbling onto StartupIdeasDB. I do not even know if I am allowed to share links here, so I will avoid that. But what stood out to me was not how exciting the ideas sounded. It was how practical they were. Many of them were rooted in real frustrations people already talk about online.\n\nThat flipped a switch for me.\n\nInstead of asking “Is this idea innovative?”, I started asking “Are people already annoyed enough to pay for a solution?”\n\nSolving problems people complain about openly is far more powerful than chasing ideas that sound impressive in founder circles. Fancy ideas get applause. Boring ideas get revenue. This holds true whether you are building B2B or B2C.\n\nLooking back, my failed ventures were not failures of effort. They were failures of judgment. I was trying to invent demand instead of listening to it.\n\nThis experience taught me something I wish I had understood earlier. Your job as an early stage founder is not to sound smart. It is to reduce pain. Quietly. Consistently. In a way people are already asking for.\n\nToday’s first dollar did not come from brilliance. It came from humility. From accepting that the best ideas are often already hiding in plain sight, inside problems people complain about every single day.\n\nIf you are early in your journey, learn this sooner than I did. The right idea will save you years.",

      "text": "Two months ago I left my job as a frontend developer to build SaaS products full time. I had about €16K saved up. I'm down to €10K now and some days the math keeps me up at night.\n\nI'm not writing this as a success story. I'm writing this because every post I see here is either \"I made $50K MRR in 3 months\" or \"don't give up, keep grinding.\" Nobody talks about what it actualy feels like in the messy middle. So heres the honest version.\n\n\n\n**The situation**\n\nI started with a first SaaS two months ago. Built it, launched it, started seeing some traction through SEO. Not life changing numbers but enough to keep me going. I decided to put it on near autopilot and let organic growth do its thing while I started building a second product like a week ago.\n\nThe logic makes sense on paper: diversify, let SEO compound, build while I still have runway.\n\nThe reality feels very different.\n\n\n\n**What nobody tells you about living on savings**\n\nSome days are genuinely good. I wake up, check my analytics, see growth, feel like I made the right call. I build features, write content, talk to users. I feel alive in a way I never did at a desk job.\n\nThen there are the other days.\n\nThe days where I open my bank account and do the mental math. €10K. Maybe 4 months of bare minimum living. I start thinking about what happens if this doesnt work. I think about going back to applying for frontend jobs, which brings its own anxiety.\n\nHeres the thing nobody talks about: I've been a frontend dev for 6 years. I can build full apps from scratch. But I studied mechanical engineering, learned to code through a bootcamp (Le Wagon), and built my skills by actualy shipping products, not by grinding LeetCode. So when companies send me technical tests, I bomb them. I can build your entire product but I cant reverse a binary tree on a whiteboard.\n\nThat gap between what I can do and what I can prove in a 45 minute coding test is terrifying when its your plan B.\n\n\n\n**What keeps me going**\n\nI have this goal that I come back to when things get dark. I want to live in Sydney. The sun, the ocean, the lifestyle. Every time I think about quitting I picture myself there and I remember why I'm doing this.\n\nIt sounds stupid when I write it down. But having a clear picture of what your building toward, not just \"financial freedom\" or \"be my own boss\" but something specific and vivid, thats the thing that gets me out of bed on the bad days.\n\nThe traction helps too. Its small but its real. And real traction, even tiny, is proof that the idea works. The question is just wether it'll grow fast enough before the savings run out.\n\n\n\n**Where I'm at mentally**\n\nI'm not gonna pretend I have this figured out. Most days I go back and forth between \"this is the best decision I ever made\" and \"I'm an idiot burning through savings on a dream.\" Sometimes both in the same hour.\n\nToday is one of those days where I just want to disappear and quit everything honestly. Ask me again tomorow and I'll probably feel better. Thats kind of how it goes.",

Two ideas that helped me:\n\n1) Put hard guardrails on the money. Decide now: “If MRR isn’t at X or trending up by Month Y, I freelance 2–3 days/week.” That turns the fear into a trigger for a plan instead of a fog.\n\n2) Stop treating product #1 as “on autopilot.” Pick one growth motion (SEO, cold outreach, or partnerships) and commit to a small weekly quota: number of articles, DMs, or emails. Momentum compounds way faster than splitting your brain across two half-marketed products.\n\nOn the job front, you can dodge a lot of LeetCode hell by aiming at smaller startups, networking into teams, and showing real projects instead of tests. I’ve landed work that way using my own apps as the portfolio, plus things like Upwork and cold DMs; tools like Ahrefs, Indie Hackers, and Pulse for Reddit help me find where my exact users and potential employers hang out.\n\nMain point: give your fear a job with clear rules, focus on one growth engine, and keep a realistic “back to cashflow” plan so Sydney stays a goal, not an escape fantasy.",

You'll thank me in 4 months.\n\nIt's not that I don't believe you can build a profitable SaaS, it's just that in the real world (not Twitter, not MRR screenshots) building a solid business takes a long time and sometimes you might make all the right choices and still fail, because it takes a combination of grit, skills, network, luck.\n\nYou said your expenses are 2.5k / month. Building a SaaS that makes real, stable long term 2.5k MRR takes a long time. Most people never make it. Doing it in 4 months is really fucking hard. Disregard the people who launch an app and declare \"18k MRR!\" after a week. that's not MRR. It's revenue, not recurring.  \nOn top of that, if your actual livelihood depends on this target, it's even harder because as the days go by you start questioning every choice and you start making panic-based choices. Which is the worst mental state to be in when running a business.\n\nIt's just a horrible place to be in and one you shouldn't put yourself in voluntarily.\n\nI don't want to be the negative one, I really wish you all the success in the world but I've been burned myself by the \"just quit! Be a indie hacker!\" voices and it was fucking horrible. I just want to be honest with you so you can spare yourself some dark days. I think sometimes you just need someone to be brutally honest with you.\n\nAs for myself, now I am doing a combination of client work and SaaS and it's much much much easier mentally, as I can sustain myself but my life doesn't depend on my customers not churning.",

I've heard good things about AsteroCFO. Ai for this exact situation. Their AI CFO does monthly cash reviews that spot risks before they become emergencies for like â‚¬350/month, and you can ask unlimited questions about your numbers in plain English.\n\nWay cheaper than hiring someone and you get answers immediately instead of doing panicked mental math at 2am. Either way, get some kind of system that shows you the actual numbers daily. The fear of not knowing is worse than knowing you have 12 weeks and need to hit X revenue.\n\nGood luck with the products.

However, I’ve seen this '12-hour laptop trap' **hundreds of times in my 15 years as a mentor**. You are currently in what I call the **'Circle of Busyness'**: where you mistake movement for progress.\n\nIn my book, **'Startup Inferno'**, I explain that a productive day isn't defined by how many emails you sent, but by how much you reduced the 'structural friction' of your business.\n\nHere is my advice to change your mindset:\n\n1. **Focus on 'Leverage' tasks:** Writing a blog post is fine, but did it improve your conversion rate? Sending emails is okay, but did it shorten your sales cycle? A productive day is one where you build a 'brick' that stays there forever, not just one where you 'tread water'.\n2. **Stop the 12-hour madness:** After 35 years in global strategy and startups, I can tell you: nobody is truly strategic after the 8th hour of staring at a screen. You are likely building a **'Frankenstein Startup',** adding features or content out of anxiety rather than clear vision.\n3. **The 1-Metric Rule:** Define a productive day by one single metric. For you, it might be: 'Did I talk to one fashion photographer today to understand why they haven't paid yet?' That one call is worth 10 blog posts.\n\nA productive day is when you are closer to a scalable system, not just when you are tired. How many of those 12 hours are spent actually talking to potential users vs. just 'polishing' your tool?",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI built HiFi.fan — an independent audio news and product platform. After 2+ years of solo development, I'm putting it up for sale. Wanted to share the honest numbers and lessons.\n\n**The numbers:**\n- 57,000 active users (2025)\n- 87,000 annual page views\n- 375% year-over-year growth\n- 3,500+ returning visitors\n- $0 revenue (never monetized)\n\n**What it is:**\nA Next.js platform that aggregates audio industry news, product listings, and specs. Think \"what's happening in hi-fi\" in one place. Built with a custom data pipeline that auto-collects content.\n\n**Tech stack:** Next.js, React, Node.js, automated data collection pipeline\n\n**What went right:**\n- Found a real niche — audiophiles actively searching for gear info\n- Growth was organic, no paid marketing\n- Built solid tech infrastructure\n\n**What went wrong:**\n- Never prioritized monetization (classic developer trap)\n- Spent too much time on features, not enough on business model\n- Running it solo meant no accountability on the revenue side\n- Life priorities shifted — can't give it the time it deserves\n\n**Lessons for this community:**\n1. Build monetization into v1, not \"someday\"\n2. 57K users means nothing if you can't convert them\n3. A solo project needs revenue milestones, not just feature milestones\n4. Know when to pass the torch — someone with ad sales experience could monetize this quickly\n\n**Why I'm selling:**\nI simply don't have the time anymore. The platform works, the audience is there, but it needs someone who can focus on the business side. Hosting is ~$100/month self-hosted.\n\n**What's included:**\nFull codebase, domain (hifi.fan), all content, data pipeline, user base, documentation.\n\nIf you're interested or have questions, DM me or email cajoy@hifi.fan.\n\nHappy to share more details with serious inquiries.",

When you’re deep in building, monetization always feels like “I’ll do it once it’s bigger.”\n\nOut of curiosity — did users ever ask for anything that hinted at willingness to pay? Like comparison tools, price alerts, saved setups, etc.?\n\nAlso, if you’re selling it, 57k active users + 375% YoY growth is not small. The right buyer might care way more about the audience than the revenue.\n\nEither way — this is the classic dev trap, but at least you built something real. Most people don’t even get to 57 users.",

The \"build audience first, monetize later\" trap catches so many of us.\n\nI did the same thing with my first product—focused entirely on user growth because it felt productive and validating. 6 months in, I had thousands of visitors but no revenue model that actually worked. The mental shift from \"how do I get more users?\" to \"how do I make money from users?\" is harder than it sounds.\n\nYour lesson about \"revenue milestones, not feature milestones\" hits hard. I had feature checklists. I had user growth charts. What I didn't have was a spreadsheet that said \"by month 3, we need $500 MRR or we change something fundamental.\"\n\nThe brutal truth: users don't automatically convert to revenue just because you have lots of them. 57K audiophiles is an incredible niche audience—affluent, passionate, always buying gear. The fact that it generated $0 isn't a product failure, it's a business model failure. And those are much easier to fix when you catch them early.\n\nFor anyone reading this: if you can't answer \"how will this make money in the first 90 days?\" before you write your first line of code, you're not building a business yet. You're building a project. Both are fine, but know which one you're doing.\n\nGood luck with the sale. The tech and audience you've built is genuinely valuable—just needs someone with a different skillset than pure product development.",

If YOU have to ask then I think it suggests it is not possible for you. But Richard Branson never asked anyone whether it was possible. And if I had to guess he never knew if it would work or not, he was having fun and trying to make some money along the way.\n\nI listened to a few of Branson’s masterclass videos and read a biography years ago. The guy just has brass balls he developed from his youth. I remember a story of his mom dropping he and his brother off in the middle of road and making them find their way home. Stuff young adults today would say was “abuse”, but his mom was trying to teach them to be resourceful and solve problems on their own. Branson told a story of how he founded the airline. He was stuck in an airport and his flight kept getting delayed so he just walks into a hangar and talks to some people with planes. Charters one, writes on a paper board “Flights for $99 to wherever the f” he was going, and sold the rest of the empty seats. That was the genesis for the airline idea. \n\nYou look some random ass facts like “he only had this much money” blah blah and you think that is a linchpin to whether he was successful or a failure? He is successful because he tried bold ideas, he solves problems, he doesn’t ask for permission, etc. His mindset is not one to ask Reddit if it will work, he acts on his ideas and sees them through to fruition, and some worked and some didn’t.",

He may have leased a used 747 for a lot less, but he used the cashflow and reputation of the existing Virgin businesses to guarantee the airline and get away with starting the airline itself on comparatively little capital whilst assuring it would't fold whilst he fought for routes (as Freddie Laker found out the hard way).\n\nEarly cashflow came from forward ticket sales. I can remember a tale of Branson writing a cheque to fill the 747 with fuel and wincing.\n\nAnd Virgin Music was launched on an inheritance of around £3k from an aunt and £300 from his mother in 1970s money, plus a bank loan guaranteed by family money of £25k. Modern cash equivalents probably approaching £200k in total.\n\nIt cost him £2500 to cover the studio costs for Tubular Bells...and the net profits on the sales of that were around £5m-£7m in 70's money.\n\nSO: Sure everyone really starts from 'just an idea', but these founder myths aren't helpful.\n\nBranson bootsrapped a smaller business first that was financed, and used that to underpin a bigger business.  You gotta either bring growth capital, or underwritten financing with you pretty quickly if you want to start to make noises in a sector.\n\nNone of this to say that championing Tubular Bells and making a pile out of it, or seeing where Freddie Laker went wrong weren't genius business moves...they definitely were...it's just that he came from an upper middle class background despite the hippy veneer, and was positioned to make it happen.\n\nSome version of that is the lesson for doing the same today.",

Having spent **35 years** navigating both global multinationals and the startup world, and **15 years mentoring hundreds of founders**, I’ve seen this 'Branson myth' lead many people straight into what I call the **'Circle of Heresy',** denying current market reality.\n\nIs it still possible? **Yes, but the rules have changed.**\n\n1. **From 'Flashy Marketing' to 'Structural Trust':** In the 80s, you could launch an airline with a bold move and a phone call. Today, transparency is 10x higher. You can't just 'convince' partners; you need to demonstrate a system that works. In my book **'Startup Inferno'**, I call this avoiding the **'Frankenstein Startup',** don't just stitch together promises; build a solid core.\n2. **The 'Pre-payment' Reality:** Using customer money to scale (bootstrapping) is still the ultimate gold standard. But today, customers are more cynical. You need a 'Minimum Viable Trust' before they hand over their cash.\n3. **The Leverage of 2026:** Branson didn't have AI or global digital reach. Today, you don't need millions to start, but you need **extreme focus**. The danger now isn't 'not having resources', it's 'wasting resources' on 100 different paths.\n\nSuccess today isn't about being a billionaire first; it's about being the most **resilient architect** of your own vision. Most people fail not because they lack Branson's money, but because they lack his ability to simplify complex chaos into a single, executable mission.",

If you're doing high volume residential might be worth it, but for a small team it felt like overkill and the cost didn't make sense.\n\njobber also well known, way cleaner interface, made more sense, scheduling worked great, invoicing was easy, support actually answered my questions fast, but it is not built or home services specifically just service businesses in general, customization is limited, like you can't really change invoice templates much, it is reliable but feels pretty generic and people say once you hit a certain size you outgrow it but it's expensive enough that you'd expect it to scale better.\n\nbizzen is way newer, only heard about it from another mate, it's specifically built for the admin stuff that kills your time, I can create estimates by just talking while I'm driving no add-ons or per-user fees, downside is it doesn't do crew dispatching or project management like the big platforms, it's really just focused on automating admin work, if you need complex scheduling this isn't it, but if you're solo or small team, it makes sense.\n\nSo imo housecall may work for bigger residential operations, jobber is a good option for small to medium teams that want reliable basics and bizzen is for solo or small contractors drowning in admin work, want automation but don't need fancy project management.",

Some weeks it feels like I spend more time gathering proof than improving the product.\n\n\n\n  \nWe have docs, we have policies, we have answers saved but it still takes effort every single time. Is there anything that makes the process more structured instead of just better internal docs?",

New vendor portal shows up? We tag each question with IDs and just crosswalk to existing answers instead of rewriting. After 3–4 big deals, 80–90% is copy/paste plus light tweaks.\n\nLayer in structure: one owner for security reviews, a weekly “evidence refresh” slot, and a simple notion/airtable that tracks which control maps to which doc/log/export so you’re not hunting every time. Tools like Vanta/Drata help automate some evidence pulls, same with G2 Track-style asset inventories; Pulse has actually been useful for us to mine and organize Reddit threads about buyer concerns so our standard responses hit the right language.\n\nPoint is: build a reusable security library and make each new review just mapping, not rewriting.",

It was that feeling of discovery, of something new every time you \"logged on.\" I thought about this for a while and finally started building a silly fun idea.\n\n  \n**A worldwide, anonymous question of the day app.** If you answer the question, then your postcard gets sent to a random person, and you get a random person's card. Each postcard gets sent out with a stamp of your country.\n\nEvery day, you open the app for a few minutes, collect a new stamp and postcard, read a little about a new culture or perspective, take a few moments to write something, then close the app and forget about it.  Quick, simple, joyful.\n\n  \nI finally launched it **2 weeks ago** on the Apple App Store. Since then, I've had over **500 downloads, 25+ countries participate, a peak day of 87 users**, and since then a fairly consistent 30-50 daily users. The reactions I've gotten from folks have been exactly spot on for the feeling I wanted to create, and the reason I made the app. I've got to read some enlightening and surprising cards and learned about different cultures in the process.\n\nI'm not sure where it will go or where I'll take it yet. I've already put a few UI updates out with more features and fixes. I just want to slowly build the daily active users and find people who really love it.\n\nIf you have an iPhone and want to check it out, DM me for a link!",

I've managed companies. I've managed large sales teams.I've been an employee... Nope.\n\nIs it more difficult the way that I choose to do business?? Absolute at times. Yesterday was a good case in point.\n\nI had a few million dollars worth of inventory land at my warehouse. I unloaded it with a forklift, then I broke open all the wooden crates and unloaded everything (thousands of 45#-65# boxes) into sorted piles by part number on the ground and then took inventory. Then, I rearranged and stocked the entire warehouse. So the new inventory would go in the back, and the old stuff would be in the front. I've replaced labels on all the boxes and made it the way I like it. I picked thirty seven back.Order orders from new customers because I picked all first orders. A package them and shipped them. Then, I cleaned up the warehouse and went home at midnight. Woke up at five a m. Went to my warehouse and loaded up deliveries to a handful of local customers ive had since the beginning and hand delivered all of their orders. It was about a 6 hour trip. While driving, I took new orders from new customers. I received payments. \n\nI got back to my shop and I had six new customer orders, so I onboarded them and picked packed and shipped their orders. Sent their invoices and tracking number and then received their payments and sent out receipts. Update my sales board for the day and my numbers for the week and then month.\n\nNow my day starts. All that other stuff was just because of the inventory arriving yesterday. Moments like these only happen a couple times a year. When they happen though it's a burn, the boat's moment you work until you're done. This is why I get paid the big bucks. \n\nI could have hired someday labor. I could have shipped the orders instead of delivering them. I can automate even first orders through my 3PL including the onboarding process and payment process. \n\nThis was my vision of how my company would run, and it works well. I like the hectic crazy times a few times a year. It reminds me of all the beginning years when it was every day.\n\nSo, yes, you can build a business as big as you want. We should break nine figures this year.And that's nine figures, top line and bottom line. Without another soul employed. You'll have to put systems in place. You'll have to be the most proficient person in every role necessary at all times, with skill sets and experience to backet. \n\nI love business. It's the only life or death game left for us humans.",

Not surveys, actual intent signals. If presell doesn't work but waitlist does, you've got data on what to build. If neither works, you've got information that saves you months.\n\nWeek 4 is the pivot point. By now you know if you're chasing something people want or just something interesting to you. The tactical difference now is whether you go deep on one paying customer or iterate based on waitlist data. Both paths are valid but they're very different businesses.\n\n",

Content takes forever to build momentum.\n\n\n\nWhat's actually moving the needle for me lately is cold outreach but with a twist - I stopped just emailing \"hey let's chat\" and started sending a quick, relevant website demo for their business. Like I'll find a local shop with a garbage site, use Thyonix to whip up a modern version in like 5 minutes, and send a Loom walkthrough. Cuts through the noise because you're showing value immediately, not just asking for time.\n\n\n\nIt's still outreach, feels a bit spammy sometimes, but the reply rate is way higher. The key is making it feel like you've already done the work for them.",
