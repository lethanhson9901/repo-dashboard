      "text": "hey everyone.\n\ni'm a high school student from argentina. down here, things are pretty volatile economically, so i realized early on that if i wanted to build a future, i needed to learn skills that worked globally.\n\nlast year, i took harvard's cs50p (free on youtube). i became obsessed with the idea that \"if you do it more than twice, you should script it.\"\n\ni wanted to share the projects i've built in the last few months to test my skills in the real world. maybe this inspires other teenagers to start coding.\n\n\\*\\*1. the \"virtual photographer\" (computer vision)\\*\\*\n\na local clothing brand was spending a fortune on photoshoots. i wrote a pipeline that takes a messy flat-lay photo of a t-shirt on a table, cleans it, and uses ai to put it on a realistic virtual model.\n\n\\*tech:\\* python, comfyui logic, custom upscaling for skin texture.\n\n\\*result:\\* they stopped hiring models.\n\n\\*\\*2. the \"seo watchdog\" (automation)\\*\\*\n\ni realized manual seo tracking is boring and expensive. i built a script that scrapes google search results for specific keywords daily and logs the ranking changes in a simple dashboard, alerting if a competitor moves up.\n\n\\*tech:\\* beautifulsoup, python, telegram api for alerts.\n\n\\*\\*3. the \"lead hunter\" (scraping)\\*\\*\n\ni needed to find local businesses to talk to, so i built a bot that scrapes google maps for specific niches (like \"plumbers in \\[city\\]\"), extracts their emails, and verifies if they are active.\n\n\\*\\*what i learned:\\*\\*\n\nthe code itself isn't the hard part. the hard part is understanding the business problem (like \"photos are expensive\" or \"data entry is boring\") and translating that into logic.\n\ni'm currently diving into 3d engineering automation (rhino/grasshopper) for a new challenge.\n\njust wanted to share my journey so far. if you are young and hesitating to learn python: just start. it literally changes how you see the world.",

With our knowledge of this exact space and a common issue you're facing, it can be a real game changer (especially for agencies as what they see, is how they choose what you're worth up front) and then the extra revenue can allow for faster scaling, and subsequently a faster rise in take home.

Most agencies are going to net anywhere from 15-25% depending on how good of controls you have in place. I would say you should review your costs as there is probably some leakage in there. There may be another point or two in there.\n\nFor the most part though the thing post people don’t talk about are things like taxes and benefits and so on that when you’re an employee you don’t recognize. Also the infrastructure and marketing to drive the business have a cost that a lot of people don’t think about when they are an employee.\n\nAll and all, you’re doing well it just takes time to get where you actually want to be.",

And “good ROI” on ads is not profit if fulfillment and tools swell right behind it.

Your girlfriend is asking about security. Security comes from boring math, not hustle. A business can look “successful” and still be one bad month away from panic.\n\n“Your margin is my opportunity,” Jeff Bezos said.  \nTranslation: if you don’t defend margin, everyone else will take it.  \nApplication: margin becomes a rule, not a hope.\n\n* **Productize the offer** so delivery is predictable, not a custom puzzle every time.\n* **Cap contractor spend** per unit of work, so costs don’t chase revenue upward.\n* **Cut overhead hard**, including tools and ad spend that demands extra labor, and pay yourself first as real overhead.\n\nAnyway, back to the 20%....  \n  \nIn 2023, Amazon generated approximately $574.8 billion in net sales.

Instead, the advice, DMs, and encouragement i received literally changed my trajectory.\n\nBecause of the doors that opened and the confidence i gained from your comments, I’ve managed to scale that initial win to around $1.500 in revenue this month. I’ve even locked in deals with national and international brands.\n\nI’m not saying this to brag. I’m saying this because i want to give back. i don't have a course to sell, but I do have a process that works for me. If this helps even one person get their first client, I’ll be happy.\n\nHere is the exact blend of high tech and  old school hustle I used to fill my pipeline:\n\n1) The AI approach or lead Gen\n\nI realized that spamming people with generic IA templates is a waste of time. Instead, I use AI to be more human, not less.\n\nI use AI agents to scrape leads, but I filter strictly by pain points. I don't look for successful businesses. I look for businesses with great products but terrible websites, or active Instagrams with no link in bio, or some kind of problem that i can fix.\n\nI feed the business's data into an LLM to draft a cold email, but i force it to focus on their problem, not my service.\n\nI never send the raw AI output. i rewrite the opening line manually to prove i actually looked at their brand. High personalization == High response rate.\n\n2. Networking\n\nThis was a game-changer advice I got from a user here.\n\nI stopped trying to act like a corporate agency and started owning my age.\n\nI reach out to potential leads on LinkedIn or email saying I'm a 16 years old student building a business, and I'd love your feedback on X.\n\nPeople are incredibly kind when they see you are young and trying to build something. They lower their guard, they give advice, and often, that advice turns into a contract because they want to support the hustle.\n\n3. Boots on the ground \n\nThis is the one most people skip because it's uncomfortable, but it brought me my best clients.\n\nI physically walk into local businesses.\n\nI don't pitch. i listen. i ask, what is the most annoying thing about your marketing /tech right now?\n\nI offer to lend a hand with something small for free first. Fix a glitch, edit a photo, update a setting.\n\nThat small act of kindness builds trust faster than any cold email ever could.\n\nTo the community ❤️\n\nThank you for not dismissing me because of my age. You guys gave me the push i needed to take this seriously.\n\nA question for those ahead of me:\n\nI’m starting to get to the point where i have more leads than time. For those who scaled past this point did you automate more first, or did you hire help immediately?",

I say ride the wave with your business, and let it fund the things you want to achieve in life, whether that is funding college, or bigger and more enterprising ventures that can scale beyond what time you personally have available.\n\nIn the meantime, you could look into only taking projects that are worth it to you. Not every project will be equal, and maybe your time is more valuable than $500, or later $1500, or later who knows?",

Receiving that email was one of the best days of my career and a major moment for our company. \n\nIt took about 3-4 weeks to go through diligence and agree on the deal points. It was a Tuesday evening that we finally agreed to everything over a call and I was told that Docusign would be sent the next day and funds wired Friday. \n\nThursday comes and still no Docusign. I email to check in with leadership, and everything seemed on track just delayed with upcoming holidays. \n\nThen Monday arrives with a phone call. When I answer, the venture team asks me to google their company to see a press release. I then come to find out that they had taken a human first position as a company and are not touching AI, which somehow the venture team had no idea…our platform is an AI interactive media platform for superfans to create music, stories, etc inside licensed franchise IP. \n\nMy lesson. Take the damn deal, because it might not be there again in 3 weeks. \n\nNot slowing us down, just changes a few things temporarily. ",

I am now back to searching for a reliable alternative that actually delivers what they promise, since the last site I used didn't really meet my expectations.\n\nI have been creating content on Instagram for a while, and I really enjoy it, but my engagement has slowed down. My posts get views, but likes, comments, and shares are not growing the way I hoped. I decided to buy Instagram followers because even though I post regularly and use hashtags, it still feels like some of my videos go unnoticed.\n\nI spent time reading discussions on Reddit and other platforms to understand how creators improve engagement. A friend also told me that it helped them get more visibility, but the specific site I tried just didn't deliver the quality I needed.\n\nMy goal is to find services that offer real, active profiles that help content get noticed without putting an account at risk. If anyone has experience with buying Instagram followers from a better source that improved engagement, I would really appreciate your advice.\n",

It felt higher-quality than services I’d tried before (I had worse luck with Buzzoid, Twicsy and Stormlikes), but it wasn’t a magic bullet — the followers alone didn’t sustain engagement.\n\n\n\nWhat helped afterward: stagger buys (small, timed boosts), buy likes/comments not just raw follower numbers, laser-target your niche, respond to every comment fast, collab with one microcreator, and run a couple of cheap Reels or story ads to convert visibility into real followers. Also avoid huge overnight spikes — slow and steady looks more organic and lowers risk.",

We lost the irl connections to exchanges on the internet, and now we’re losing our exchanges on the internet to a sea of bots, karma farmers, AI marketers, AI content creators…. we cant even connect on social media anymore. \n\nMaybe we’ll get back to craving in person interaction as a result. Perhaps we’ll see a resurgence for public spaces, and businesses that promote in person connection. \n\nSorry, was this a Wendy’s? ",

Increasingly, it seems customers immediately issue chargebacks when they don't recognize a charge without first contacting the company to ask about it — lose lose for everyone.\n\nI see people saying Amazon spoils you by handling disputes — part of the reason is because they seem to accept all of them.  Sellers rarely are given the benefit of the doubt with Amazon (from my experience anyway).  It seems this would be the same as you simply accepting all the disputes and saving your time (although a high loss rate could have future consequences with your payment processor).\n\nStripe has an option where you can buy chargeback insurance and they will handle it all — I think they may even guarantee your money (but I'm not sure about that part).  I'm also not sure if this offer is open to everyone or only sellers with a low chargeback history. I  almost bought it, might still in the future.",

Amazon not only provides traffic, it absorbs a ton of operational friction.\n\nSome of the things I’ve seen that spike Shopify disputes are stuff like longer delivery windows or inconsistent tracking updates, customers not recognizing the charge descriptor, and selling higher-ticket or impulse-buy products without strong post-purchase comms.\n\nAt some point, it becomes cheaper to just change the system than dispute every charge. That can mean better descriptors, order confirmation emails, delivery notifications, and even preemptive refunds in some cases.\n\nYou're not wrong that the time drain is brutal. Disputes aren’t really about “proof.” They're about how card networks bias the outcome.",

Tried to close deals over text. Then gradually went cold when someone wanted a call. I was literally letting go of opportunities.\n\nI was distracting myself with 1% improvements while avoiding what was probably a 400% business growth at that point.\n\n\nI didn’t magically fix it, but this is how I deal with it now:\n\n1. I only work with big high-ticket clients, so the earnings per talking ratio would be optimal.\n\n2. Brought on a sales rep.\n\n3. Reduced impostor syndrome by becoming more of an expert. So that people can’t corner me by asking something I don’t know.\n\n\nHope this helps a fellow introvert out there :)\n",

      "text": "I have been running a dev agency for more than 4 years now, and yes, it is a real business. At one point, I had around 10 people on the team, and we were making 6–7 thousand USD per month (I’m from a third‑world country, Azerbaijan, where the average salary is around 400–600 USD). However, it was tough. Managing a team and constantly searching for clients drained a lot of energy and time.\n\nI had what many would call a “dream life”: I could control how and when I worked, technically decide when to take a vacation, and be my own boss. But the reality was different. I didn’t have true freedom. My life slowly became my business.\n\nMy story isn’t unique, I know that. Many smart people warned me that this path wasn’t sustainable and wouldn’t give me real freedom or anything close to passive income. Still, I continued running the business and even expanded to the UK to get easier access to European clients.\n\nThen AI hit hard. Yes, I know it’s been around for more than three years, but its true potential really became clear with the release of ChatGPT 5 and now Opus 4.5, which gives a glimpse of what AGI might look like. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, take a look at tech Twitter - Opus 4.5 can genuinely function as an assistant now with some setup.\n\nI’ve been a developer since I was 13 (25 now), and I know from experience that professional development is hard and time‑consuming. But recent advances in AI have significantly eased the entire process. Today, it’s actually possible to build an MVP, or even a fairly complex SaaS platform - in weeks, or at most a few months. We’ve already done this multiple times, and that’s when I realized it was time to shift.\n\nThe shift was toward focusing on building my own products and removing my dependence on clients.\n\nOver the last six months, I’ve strategically started reducing the size of my team. It was a tough decision, but to make this transition, I needed to lower my running costs. Now I’ve settled on having one junior developer who helps with simple tasks. I’m heavily training her to use AI and leverage the technology as much as possible, and I’ve kept an accountant to handle all legal matters. This month alone, I’ve already built one product, and the second one is currently in progress.\n\nMy recommendation to anyone thinking about starting an agency: think very carefully about what kind of freedom you’re actually aiming for. True freedom is much harder to achieve through an agency than it looks from the outside. In most cases, you’re simply replacing a boss with clients, deadlines, and constant operational pressure.\n\nIf freedom, control over your time, focus, and mental energy is your real goal, it increasingly seems easier to achieve it by building small apps, experimenting with different SaaS products, and creating assets that don’t depend on constant client work. An agency can work, but it has to stay small, highly optimized, and focused on high‑paying customers. Otherwise, it’s very easy to build yourself another full‑time job instead of the freedom you were looking for.",

But I also create products — so both products and services at the same time.\n\nService work is an interesting and skill-building way to make money early on with low risk.  But eventually you can burn out, particularly if you are both chasing and delivering the service.  \n\nIf you are a creative person who really cares about your clients, you will also tire of always having to explain the various options to every client — and then worry that they will go against your recommendations.  You will find it much better to create your own products and focus your energy and skill on something that sticks with you.  But it also has a different set of problems of course.\n\nThere are no perfect answers, but knowing what you want your future to look like can help you get there.",

      "text": "Started this in late November. Film myself once, use the footage for 11 different accounts with different faces. Seemed like a shortcut.\n\nI'd do the real movements and expressions, just change the face. So I wouldn't be on camera but the content would still feel authentic.\n\nHonestly just kept making more accounts. Started with 3, then made a few more when those didn't pop immediately. Ended up with 11.\n\nFirst few weeks were just setup. Created 11 different characters using reference photos. Made them look different enough that you wouldn't connect the accounts. Different ages, ethnicities, styles.\n\nFor the face swaps I'm using whatever works. Been rotating between APOB, Reface, and HeyGen depending on what I need. APOB I use most because I can process a few at a time. Reface is faster for single edits. HeyGen has better lip sync but costs more. None of them are perfect.\n\nThe workflow: film myself doing 5-6 exercises in one session, usually Sunday mornings in my apartment gym when no one's around. Feels weird doing burpees and talking to a camera by myself but whatever. Then I process them through whichever tool makes sense, export the versions, schedule them. Takes about 4-5 hours per week now. Setup took way longer though, probably 30-40 hours total in the first month.\n\nWeek 6 I was done. All accounts under 500 followers after putting in all that time. Sat there staring at the analytics thinking I'd wasted a month and a half on the dumbest idea ever. Almost deleted everything.\n\nThen account 1 randomly popped off. Woke up one morning to 50k views on a video I thought was mediocre. Checked my phone like five times thinking it was a glitch. Now it's at 8k followers and still growing. Some videos hit 10k views, some get 2k. No pattern I can figure out.\n\nAccounts 3, 5, and 7 are doing okay. Between 800-2k followers each. They grow but slow. Making around $200 total per month from affiliate stuff across these three.\n\nThe rest are basically dead. Highest one is under 500 followers after two months. Some videos barely get any views. I'm posting the same frequency, same hooks, same everything. Just different faces.\n\nStarted noticing weird patterns. The account with the older looking character does way better with strength training content. The younger looking one gets more engagement on HIIT stuff. Makes no sense because it's literally the same person doing the movements.\n\nAlso ran into issues I didn't expect. One account got flagged for \"inauthentic behavior\" on Instagram. Nothing happened but it spooked me. Another one, people started commenting that something looked off. One comment was like \"why does your face look different in every video lol\" and I panicked. Tried different tools to see if one looked more natural but they all have issues sometimes.\n\nThe successful account made $520 in December and is tracking around $450 so far this month from supplement links. So across all accounts I'm at maybe $650-700 monthly depending on the month.\n\nMy roommate thinks the whole thing is weird. Keeps asking why I'm filming myself then not posting my real face. Can't really explain it without sounding sketchy.\n\nBiggest problem is I can't figure out what made account 1 successful. I've tried copying everything about it to the dead accounts. Same posting times, same caption style, same hashtags. Nothing moves the needle.\n\nPart of me wants to kill the bottom 6 but I keep thinking what if they just need more time. I've already put in the work to set them up. Feels wasteful to delete them when posting is basically automated now anyway.\n\nAlso paranoid about the face swap thing. Haven't seen anyone else talk about getting flagged for it but I know platforms are cracking down on synthetic content. Don't know if I should mention in bios that it's not my real face or just keep quiet.\n\nAnyone running multiple accounts like this? Feels like I'm either onto something or wasting time on accounts that'll never work.",

This is where I'd want to look at the user base and understand what niche I've hit, instead of analyzing the content on its own. \n\n\nWay to do that if you don't have access to analytics: create a fresh account, look up similar media, and doom scroll until you hit your video, trying different types of trends if you don't. Then see what the algorithm feeds you after you hit your content. You may be shocked, or it could just...make sense. Derive the population watching this and what content they are expecting to see from that experience. Easy-peasy. \n\n\nThe slowly growing userbase might be more valuable in the future than the almost viral post, but you can derive good information from both. The real value here is not the money, but the data. If you cannot at least infer it from using the app, then you're not the one who's gonna make the money off of your content. ",

December is the Christmas month, revenue falls off a cliff in the 1st as there is no money for advertising so your conversion and ppc drop dramatically in January year on year.

You've just collected polite rejections dressed up as interest.\n\nLast year I talked to maybe 50 people about something I was building. Most said some version of \"sounds useful\" or \"keep me posted.\" So I built it. Launched. And then... nothing. That weird purgatory where people sign up, poke around, and never come back.\n\nI've since watched this same pattern wreck other founders too. Someone comes into a thread excited, saying \"we talked to customers and built exactly what they asked for!\" and I already know what's coming. They built a Franken-product from scattered opinions. Solved nothing deeply. Pleased no one fully.\n\nWhat finally clicked for me: I was asking the wrong questions. \"Would you use this?\" is basically asking someone to be nice to you. And people are nice. Saying yes costs them nothing.\n\nThe thing that actually worked was getting uncomfortable. Asking \"what would you pay for this, right now, today?\" and then shutting up. Counting the seconds. If they hesitate more than 3 seconds, they're not thinking through logistics. They're searching for a polite way to say no.\n\nReal interest sounds like \"when can I start?\" or \"how much?\" Fake interest sounds like \"interesting, keep me posted.\" Totally different animals, and I couldn't tell them apart until I started asking harder questions.\n\nI ended up documenting the whole process I use now, the questions, the signals, how to tell if someone will actually pay before you build anything. Helps me not fall into the same trap twice.\n\nCurious if anyone else has been through something similar or sees it differently.",

It was just me thinking about how every December comes with the same drama: no buses anywhere and transport fares jumping like crazy. I figured instead of complaining again this year, why not fill the gap?  So I just went for it. I got the buses, did all the registration wahala, and placed them at strategic spots around town. And let me tell you, this thing picked up faster than I expected. We are  not even in the peak festive rush yet, but the returns have already been solid. People need transport every day, and the demand has been consistent.   The funny part is that the first set I ordered from Alibaba has already gone up in price. That alone made me realize something important. If you sit on an idea for too long, life will move on without you. Execution will always beat overthinking.   I have  told  few friends the same thing. Stop waiting for the perfect moment. Just start. This transport venture wasn’t even in my plans for the year, but it’s turning out to be one of the smartest moves I made.  Sometimes the best wins come from the decisions you don’t overthink.",

We'd been talking to this BD guy who wanted 5% and I was about to say yes because... idk, he seemed confident about it and I had nothing to compare it to.\n\nThe whole equity thing is way more nuanced than I realized when we incorporated. Like there's fully diluted vs issued shares, how safes actually convert (not how I thought they did), what happens to the option pool when you raise. My cofounder and I spent an entire weekend just trying to figure out what we'd actually be giving away if we said yes to this advisor.\n\nAnyway we didn't give him the 5%. Moved our cap table into mantle after that whole mess because our spreadsheet was making me anxious every time I opened it, couldn't tell if the formulas were even right. But honestly the bigger lesson was just... ask other founders before you commit to anything equity related.

By 2016, it was pulling 10 million page views a month.  \nAnd by starting this blog, she \"accidentally\" built a focus group.\n\nReaders were constantly asking where to find the products from her interviews, but Emily noticed she didn't like most of the brands herself. So she decided to build one she would.\n\nIn 2014, Glossier launched with just four products. That's it. No giant catalog. Her readers asked for a better face wash.  \nGlossier turned those comments into Milky Jelly Cleanser, which is now a bestseller.  \nInstead of celebrities, she went all-in on UGC. Customers would post photos, and Glossier would repost them. They picked real customers with small but loyal followings, which resulted in 70% of online sales coming from referrals.\n\nThey grew so fast, but their profit didn't. So they partnered with Sephora and sold their products in Sephora stores. It got them lower margins and a bigger reach. By 2018, four years later, Glossier hit $400 million. By 2021, $1.8 billion.\n\nI didn’t expect a simple blog to turn into a billion-dollar brand, but here we are lol\n\nEDIT: People are dming me about a \"link\" to these case studies.  \nIm not sure i can post a link here but its marketingcrafted(dot)come",

      "text": "I was experimenting with Gemini and vibe coded a small tool called **Unsaid**. The input is simple: a WhatsApp chat export. The output is not advice or summaries. It just points out conversational patterns like a neutral third person reading the chat.\n\nI expected this to be a mildly interesting NLP side project.\n\nWhat I did not expect was how people reacted to the output.\n\nI shared it with a few friends as a joke. It went a bit viral in their circles and within days around 1500 reports were generated purely through word of mouth. People were not impressed by the tech. They were uncomfortable reading their own conversations like evidence. Some said it explained why they feel constantly confused in relationships. A few even argued with their partners because of things the report highlighted.\n\nThe real problem was not analysis. It was privacy. Nobody wants to upload personal chats anywhere, so I had to redesign that part from scratch in the safest way I could. I just put up a basic page for it at unsaid .buzz so I did not have to keep sending files manually.\n\nWhat is fascinating is this. People spend money on astrology apps like Astrotalk to understand their relationships. But when patterns are derived from their actual conversations, the reaction is far more intense.\n\nI am now considering monetising this for Indian users because WhatsApp is where most personal and even semi professional communication happens here.\n\nIs this a genuinely useful AI use case, or are we entering a weird territory where people start outsourcing emotional intelligence to LLMs?\n\nAnd if people are willing to pay for horoscopes, will they pay to see what they actually sound like in their own chats?",

Also, astrology groups people into cohorts - this is straight up ME or my significant other.\n\nBeing an authentic person to a fault, I would love this as it may help me identify things my current brain overlooks, especially in relationship oriented things that may slip through the cracks or impact the other without me really getting the point. But…I’m also the type of person that says things as honestly and objectively as possible - not someone who is trying to control or keep others in a certain way.\n\nIn summary, I think the idea is great; however, I don’t think many people in today’s society are ready for truth like this.

The security and privacy might be an issue. If you currently have to manually create the reports, that doesn't scale sustainably.

      "text": "2 years in B2B lead gen (building my own lead gen agency). Last 6 months I've been experimenting with AI to speed up my workflow, and honestly? I'm finding qualified leads I would've never caught before. (I get it a waaaay tooo long post, but hear me out, it took about 25 minutes to write it by hand and about 3 hours to structure my thoughts).\n\nThe \"obvious\" stuff everyone knows: 1 ChatGPT for email personalization. 2Scraping LinkedIn with AI parsers. 3 Basic ICP matching\n\nMy approach:\n\n1. AI-generated \"lookalike\" ICPs. I took our 20 best customers, exported their LinkedIn + company data, and fed it to Chatgpt with this prompt: *\"Find hidden commonalities. Ignore obvious stuff like industry and company size. Look at hiring patterns, tech mentions, recent news, executive backgrounds.\"* And 14 of our 20 buyers had hired a \"Head of Revenue Operations\" 3-6 months before purchasing. Not in their title - buried in company announcements and team pages. We never targeted this because it's not a job title we could filter for.\n\nHow I use it now: I scrape \"recently funded\" lists from Crunchbase, then use gpt to identify which ones have RevOps hiring signals in their careers pages or exec LinkedIn profiles. I prioritize those. Conversion rate jumped from 2.1% to 6.8% on that segment alone.\n\n2. \"Negative ICP\" analysis. Exported 500 leads from last year that never converted (including 50 where we actually talked to them and they said no). Fed the data to Claude with context: *\"Pattern-match why these were bad fits. Look for combinations of signals.\"* Companies using Salesforce + HubSpot simultaneously had 80% no-show rate on demos. Also: companies that raised Series B 6+ months ago but hadn't posted any \"we're hiring\" content in 90 days were dead ends (likely hiring freezes, no budget).\n\nHow I use it now: I built a Clay enrichment table that flags these combinations before I even reach out. If I see \"Salesforce + HubSpot\" in their tech stack, I deprioritize or skip entirely. Saved \\~15 hours/month on dead leads.\n\n3. AI-suggested \"weird\" angles. Instead of generic personalization, I use this workflow: Take a prospect's company, feed GPT their recent news + LinkedIn activity + job openings, then ask: *\"What's a specific, non-obvious business problem they likely have right now that our \\[product category\\] solves? Give me 3 angles.\"* Real example: Target was VP Sales at a Series B fintech. GPT surfaced they just expanded to 3 EU countries from US-only. Angle: *\"Compliance with EU data residency for sales calls recorded in Gong - most US fintechs miss this until it's a legal issue.\"* Result: 67% reply rate on that campaign vs. our usual 12%. The specificity hit different.\n\nMy current stack:\n\n* WarpLeads as lead database (tested 12 ICP variations last month without burning credits which is nice for AI experimentation)\n* Clay for AI enrichment and research automation\n* Instantly for sequencing\n* ChatGPT/Claude (honestly I liked Claude more) for the creative qualification angles\n\nAI doesn't just speed up busywork. It lets you *test 10x more hypotheses* about who buys and why. I went from 2-3 ICP tests per month to 15-20. Some fail hard. But the winners? 40% higher reply rates.\n\nGuys, what non-obvious AI workflows are you using for lead qualification? Still feel like I'm barely scratching the surface.",

After a while it looked more like busywork than success - if you can test more but you're not more successful year-over-year than what you did before, then nothing changed.\n\nOne salesperson's individual strength of connection to the local market was a better indicator of success than anything else, because good personal relationships always trumped \"signals\".\n\nIt's easy to look interesting, it's hard to be statistically significant.",

I like the idea of building something for myself, making my own decisions, and not always feeling like I’m working on someone else’s dream.\n\nAt the same time, I keep getting stuck in my own head. I have doubts about doing it alone. Not about the work itself, but about trusting myself enough to make the right calls, handle setbacks, and not freeze when things get hard. Some days I feel confident and motivated, other days I’m questioning if I’m even cut out for it or if I’m just romanticizing the idea.\n\nWhat messes with me is that I don’t know if this lack of confidence is just a normal part of the process or a sign that I’m not ready yet. I keep wondering if confidence is something you’re supposed to already have before starting, or if it’s something that only shows up once you’re actually in it.\n\nI guess I’m curious if anyone else has felt this way before starting their own thing. Did you push through the doubt, wait until you felt “ready,” or realize you needed a partner or some kind of safety net? Just trying to figure out if this feeling is part of the journey or something I should take seriously.",

I remember sitting in my car after my first business failed completely, thinking I wasn't cut out for entrepreneurship because I didn't have that unwavering self belief everyone talks about. Turns out the doubt never really goes away, you just get better at moving forward despite it.\n\n\n\nThe mental load is the real skill nobody teaches you about business. You're not stuck between motivation and self doubt, you're experiencing what every entrepreneur goes through but most won't admit. The difference between people who start and people who don't isn't confidence levels, its tolerance for uncertainty. I built my current company ScatterMind while still questioning myself daily, but I created systems that let me execute even when my brain was telling me I wasn't ready. Start small, track your progress, and stop waiting for permission from your own mind because it'll never come.",

The real risk is not testing yourself at all. Start stupid small, something you can’t fail catastrophically at. If you freeze, you learn. If you mess up, you adapt. That’s the job.\n\nAlso, you don’t need a partner or a safety net to begin, you need constraints. Timebox it. Budget cap it. Give yourself a 90-day experiment. If you still feel paralyzed after doing real work, then reassess. But don’t confuse fear with lack of capability.",

Working on some projects myself with image generation and LLM to keep my skills up to date.\n\nIn todays landscape, distribution is key, so being able to out the product in front of 1M users is a big advantage.\n\nIm based in EU, if you think it could be a fit, Im happy to talk more.",

              "text": "You’re dead right that distribution is the real moat here, so my main point is: pick a partner who can own the stuff you can’t, not just write code. It is SaaS-y in spirit: recurring value, clear pain point, and something we can validate early with your 1M reach. I’m focusing on fast iterations, clear metrics (activation and retention first), and a narrow v1 instead of a huge feature set. For finding partners, I’ve seen the best luck in niche Discords, founder Slacks, and communities like Indie Hackers; tools like Apollo and Clay help with outreach, and I’ve used things like PhantomBuster, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and Pulse alongside them to spot high-intent people who are already talking about similar problems. So yeah, very open to a deeper chat if we both stay brutally honest about time, ownership, and expectations from day one.",
