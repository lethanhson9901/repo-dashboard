      "text": "Last year around this time I was already trying for almost 2 years to make money online, had like 100 ideas written down, watched too much content, read a lot, and still… 0 dollars online.\n\nThe year change always hit hard, because you think this will be my year, but you’re still mostly thinking instead of actually doing. That was me.\n\nAt some point I read something very simple, it said stop thinking about 10k and just try to make 1 dollar. That sentence stayed in my head.\n\nSo in June I just tried to make 1 dollar online, nothing more. I’m in the surf niche, so I made a simple inside joke design, put it on a mug because mugs felt low risk, built a Shopify store in about 2 days and ran some ads.\n\nWhen the first sale came in and I saw that 1 dollar, I just stared at the screen for a moment. After almost 2 years of zero, it felt unreal.\n\nAt the beginning it wasn’t really profitable and some days I was just happy I didn’t lose money, but I kept changing small things, reading a bit, trying again, and then it clicked.\n\nIn around 20 days I sold about 400 mugs and made a bit over 2k profit.\n\nWhat surprised me the most wasn’t even the money, but what happened after I started really working instead of just thinking, because suddenly I understood how things actually work, I learned more in a few weeks than in the 2 years before, and I started seeing opportunities everywhere.\n\nIdeas stopped feeling like fantasies and more like things I could actually test, and that feeling alone is fucking gold.\n\nI’m still learning and still figuring things out, but I remember how stuck I felt before and just wanted to share this, maybe it helps someone who’s in that same place right now.\n\nThat’s it. Wish you all a good start:)",

      "text": "So still most people in Kenya still rely on mobile data bundles for internet access and in all honesty Safaricom (and friends) absolutely milk that system. Bundles expire, speeds drop, and you’re paying more for less. Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is cheaper, more convenient, and way more scalable… if you can get it close to people.\n\nI live in a fairly remote area, but I’m close to a market that’s still developing. One day a friend visited me and casually suggested I try running a Wi-Fi hotspot around there. At first, I didn’t take it seriously. I assumed everyone would just use Safaricom bundles for those unable  to buy wifi installation services,so I didn’t see why anyone would pay for local Wi-Fi.\nAfter thinking about it for a while, I decided to try anyway purely as an experiment.\n\nI didn’t start big or spend much. I used a second-hand MikroTik router my friend sold me, added a basic Tenda router, and connected everything to my existing Airtel 5G line, which I already pay for monthly. We ran a long Ethernet cable outside, mounted the equipment in a small box, and pointed the antennas toward the market. That was the entire setup.\n\nOn the first day, from around 10am to midnight, I made about 1,200 KES. I assumed it was just people being curious and trying something new. But the same thing happened the next day, and the day after that. On slower days I make around 1,500 KES, and on good days it goes up to about 2,000 KES.Crazy!!\n\nWithin about a week, I had recovered all my initial costs. That’s when it stopped feeling like a small side experiment and started feeling like a real opportunity.\n\nLater, a friend showed me his own dashboard. He averages around 15,000 KES per day. He also mentioned others who earn much more, but those setups are larger fiber connections, multiple locations, and years of gradual expansion. That’s when I realized this business doesn’t grow overnight. It grows with infrastructure, patience, and consistency.\n\nThe hardest part for me wasn’t the money or the hardware. It was learning how to configure MikroTik properly and setting up the billing system. Without guidance, I probably would have quit early out of frustration. Once everything was configured correctly, though, the system became fairly stable and mostly runs itself.\n\nI’m not posting this to sell anything or claim I’ve figured everything out. I just wanted to share an honest experience for anyone who’s curious . You can start small, learn as you go, and grow slowly while doing things properly over time.\n\nEstimated capital (based on my setup)\nMikroTik router  5,000 KES\nTenda router 1,500 KES\nBilling system (iterativebilling.com)  1,000 KES\nAirtel 5G internet 3,000 KES\nElectricity 1,500 KES per month\nTotal: 12,000 KES\n\nThis could definitely grow into something bigger, but it would require an big investors for better equipment, stronger infrastructure, and proper licensing. I’m still researching the regulatory side and long term setup. With the right investment and planning, this could be a solid business, especially in underserved areas.",

Here is what I learned this year:\n\n1. **The problem slide is where you win or lose.** If an investor doesn't lean forward on slide 2, the rest doesn't matter. Most founders bury their best insight on slide 8.\n2. **Founders who've experienced the problem they're solving tell better stories.** Personal connection > market research every single time.\n3. **The \"platform\" word is poison.** I removed it from at least 10 decks this year. Just tell me what the thing actually does.\n4. **Traction without context is useless.** \"10K users\" means nothing. \"10K users, 23% MoM growth, $47 average revenue per user\" means something.\n5. **Most market size slides are bullshit, and investors know it.** TAM/SAM/SOM with numbers pulled from Statista doesn't impress anyone. Show me YOUR math based on YOUR customer segments.\n6. **Financial projections are fiction, but they reveal how you think.** Show you understand unit economics and investors will forgive aggressive growth assumptions. Show hockey sticks with no underlying logic and investors will assume you don't know your business.\n7. **The team slide should answer \"why you, why now.\"** Your advisor's LinkedIn profile doesn't matter. Your 10 years solving this exact problem does.\n8. **Asking for money without showing what milestones is just amateur.** \"We need $2M for hiring and marketing\" isn't a plan. \"$2M gets us to $100K MRR and 18-month runway\" is.\n9. **Design matters less than founders think, but more than they act like it does.** Your deck doesn't need to be gorgeous, but it can't look like you don't give a shit.\n10. **Every deck should answer: what's the insight only you have?** If I could've thought of your idea without domain expertise, it's not compelling enough.\n11. **Slide count doesn't matter.** Based on my experience and Carta's insights, there's no correlation between slide number and fundraising success. If a slide is meaningful, keep it. If a slide is just \"nice to have,\" remove it.\n12. **Founders confuse features with benefits.** \"AI-powered matching algorithm\" doesn't mean shit to anyone. \"Cuts hiring time from 60 days to 12\" does.\n13. **The fundraising story matters as much as the business story.** Why this round, why this amount, why now etc. If you can't articulate it clearly, investors smell desperation.\n14. **The decks that got funded weren't perfect but they were clear.** Clarity beats cleverness every single time.\n15. **Nobody reads Slide 1 (Cover slide).** They glance at it for 3 seconds. If your tagline is a paragraph, you've already lost.\n16. **\"AI\" is a feature, not a business.** In Q1 2025, slapping \"AI\" on a slide worked. Now? It's noise. Tell me what problem you solve, not what tech stack you use.\n17. **The \"Conservative Estimate\" Lie.** We know your Year 5 projection of $100M ARR is fake. You know it's fake. Focus on how you get the first $1M instead of giving huge promises.\n18. **One idea per slide.** I see founders trying to cram the Problem, Solution, and Market Size onto one slide to \"save space.\" Don't. It looks like a random note.\n19. **Your TAM is wrong.** If you claim your Total Addressable Market is \"The Global Internet,\" you don't know who your customer is. Niche down.\n20. **Font size 10 is illegal.** If an investor has to squint to read your LTV/CAC ratio on a mobile screen, they're closing the file.\n21. **Bullet points are boring.** Use icons, use charts, use big numbers. Walls of text are for legal contracts, not pitch decks.\n22. **Stop using \"Uber for X.\"** It's almost 2026. Come up with your own category.\n23. **The Appendix is your best friend.** Keep the main deck short and tell your story clearly. Put the technical deep dives in the appendix.\n24. **PDF is the only format.** Don't send a Keynote. Don't send a PPT. Fonts break. Layouts shift. Send a PDF.\n25. **Your \"Exit Strategy\" is presumptuous.** You haven't sold one unit yet. Don't tell me about your IPO plans.\n26. **Data needs context.** Don't just show a graph going up. Label the axes. Explain the spike. Everybody love labeled axes.\n27. **Consistency signals competence.** If your headers jump around and your colors shift slightly, investors subconsciously think your code is messy too.\n28. **Frameworks kill the story.** Most founders try to use famous frameworks. But those frameworks push founders to be standard. Instead of this, create your own story.\n29. **Competition slide is your positioning.** Everybody knows you cannot compete with Google, Apple, OpenAI or other big corporates. But you really can focus a niche and grow in a vertical. You don't have to write a complex competition slide. X-Y landscape is great but you have to choose the right X and Y angles and be perfect on your niche.\n30. **Don't separate \"Why Now\" into its own slide.** Weave it naturally into your problem (it's urgent), market (it's shifting), and competition (giants are slow). When \"why now\" is isolated, it feels forced.\n\n**My predictions for 2026:**\n\n**AI will review your deck before humans do.** I've talked to investors and many of them are already using AI reviews, custom GPTs, Claude, Gemini on their emails. Your pitch deck isn't just for humans anymore. You need to explain your business to AI too. Find the balance: clear enough for AI to understand, compelling enough for humans to care.\n\n**Pre-seed rounds will get harder.** Building an MVP is easier than ever thanks to AI. So investors are asking for revenue or real traction even at pre-seed, and their bar will keep rising. My advice? Generate traction first, fundraise later -when it is possible of course. (And possible doesn't mean \"if you have money\", it means \"if it is possible as technical\")\n\n**Investor outreach will be noisier than ever.** Automation tools are everywhere now. Anyone can build a bulk email campaign to investors. Standing out will require actual creativity, not just another cold email template. The spray-and-pray approach is literally dead.",

The point about AI reviewing decks before humans really hit home, it’s the next big hurdle for founders.\n\nThat prediction is exactly why I built a custom “Pitch Deck Analyst” agent on GenSpark. I trained it on feedback from actual investors (and posts like this!). Now, when I feed it a draft, it acts like that brutally honest pre-screening AI you mentioned. It flags stuff like: “Your ‘10K users’ claim has no context,” or “Slide 5 crams problem and solution, pick one,” or “Your financials jump without a clear ‘how’.” It’s my sandbox to pressure-test decks for both AI clarity and human appeal before they go out the door.\n\nBuilding this kind of targeted agent is what platforms like GenSpark are great for. It’s become an indispensable tool to navigate exactly the future you’re describing.",

They don't want to shut you down in a conversation so they engage, ask questions, and make you feel heard. Then they go back to their lives and forget you exist. With our clients doing early validation the breakthrough moment is always when someone does something unprompted that costs them time or effort.\n\nThe question that separates real from fake is asking them to commit to something small right now. Not later, not hypothetically. \"Can I send you a rough prototype next week and get 15 minutes of feedback?\" If they say yes and actually respond when you send it, that's signal. If they hedge or go silent, the interest was performative.\n\nStop counting positive conversations and start counting actions taken. Ten people who said \"sounds interesting\" means nothing. One person who asked to be first in line when you launch means everything.",

I already had some client relationships and leads connected to the region, and the market here values execution and speed more than just pitch decks. Cost of living is definitely higher, which is exactly why I didn’t come in blind — there’s runway planned and expenses are controlled, especially in the first phase.\n\nOn the agency side, I agree it’s saturated if you’re generic. We’re not positioning as a full-stack “we do everything” digital agency. The focus is performance-driven content and production — short-form video, UGC-style creatives, and ads that actually convert, not just look good. That’s where most brands here are still weak.\n\nGeographic arbitrage alone doesn’t work long term. The play is specialization + execution, not location hype. UAE just happens to be a market where that combo gets rewarded faster if you deliver.\n\nHappy to break down the numbers or strategy further if you’re genuinely curious.",

      "text": "I want to share a reminder that small, thoughtful changes can compound faster than most people expect.\n\nI created my first product after my father died. I called it the “Estate Preparation Package.” The goal was simple. Help families organize critical estate information so the people left behind were not scrambling.\n\nWhat I did not anticipate was the confusion.\n\nA lot of people assumed they were buying a will or legal documents and I lost them in the funnel. That was not the product. I was solving an organization and action problem, not a legal drafting problem. But the name and framing were bad.\n\nSo I made a change.\n\nI renamed the product the CLEAR Kit. It became both a product name and an acronym. (Comprehensive legacy and estate administration repository.) It sounded tangible, not like a professional service, but more importantly it clarified what it was (and just as importantly what it was not).\n\nSales tripled.\n\nRecently, I made another set of changes that were far less dramatic but just as intentional. I rewrote the product page to focus on benefits instead of features. Less about what is included, more about what families can actually do with it. I also cleaned up metadata across Shopify so the product was easier to understand by both people and search engines.\n\nSales tripled again.\n\nNo viral moment. No massive rebrand. No new product.\n\nJust clearer language, better positioning, and a willingness to admit that confusion is usually our fault as founders.\n\nThe lesson I keep relearning is this. Incremental improvements stack. When you remove friction at multiple small points, the cumulative effect can be enormous.\n\nIf something isn't converting, don't assume the idea is broken. Sometimes the explanation is.",

      "text": "TL;DR - the ups and (many many) downs of starting your own agency, semi enjoyable read. Lessons Learnt at the end, for anyone in a similar position.\n\n\n\nStarted out in the space 2024, I lost my job working at a startup and decided to go freelance. And here is what 2025 looked like as the first FULL year as an agency owner starting from 0.\n\n\n\nTried to keep concise and pragmatic.\n\n\n\nQ1 - INITIAL EXCITMENT\n\n\n\nStarted the year well, we had a project lined up for building an AI SDR for a French startup. Things started well, but scope creeped to always adding more features, when pushing back to sign the contract. Suddenly not a priority anymore.\n\n\n\nThis then led to a huge outreach effort and SM posting about the solution. At this time the solution was featured on Liam Ottley’s YT video, that coupled with some viral reddit posts. Led us to onboard 5 ish clients. Had salesforce knock on the door - small flex (lol)\n\n\n\nQ2 - MAKING THE BEST OF AN OPPORTUNITY\n\n\n\nWe did the classic, onboarded too much. Which led to the inevitable, reduction in performance and lesser outcomes for clients. Churn kicked us in the stomach.\n\n\n\nFrom here partnerships with pre-existing agencies to do AI and Dev work began. Being given projects without full say on the scope, was pretty rough. Had projects to deliver 10 AI agents … \n\n\n\nBut was good cashflow, and ultimately this is when the 12 hour days started. As the projects were sold off the back of AI will replace a team of people. Scopes were ENORMOUS, and we foolishly said yes :L\n\n\n\nQ3 - THE REAL SH-T SHOW BEGINS\n\n\n\nWorking 6-7 days a week become normal & 24/7 stress.\n\n\n\nThis is when the sizes of projects became TRULY apparent. And when I truly discovered the REAL limits of AI. What will work well 85% of the time is a few weeks of intense work. And  going from 85 —> 90% effectiveness is an exponential journey (months), 1 change in the AI (prompt) will throw things off wildly, and testing becomes 10x longer…\n\n\n\nTried to partner with another agency, didn’t go too well. From being in the trenches fixing things 24/7 led me to almost forget how to delegate work effectively. \n\n\n\nOn a positive - somehow managed to start sitting at tables at billion dollar companies, speaking with legitimate 30yr IT professionals about integrating AI. Being a young guy led to many - “who tf is this?” - having a baby face didn’t help either XD\n\n\n\n\\> Also discovered, EVERYONE loves talking about AI but can never go deeper with actually how it works in the real world.\n\n\n\nQ4 - SALVAGING FROM RUINS\n\n\n\nStarted consuming monstrous amounts of caffeine, and fights with the partner became more frequent. With having such variable income, meant having no time for the relationship. Date night perma cancelled, quality netlfix time became laptop and chill (lol)\n\nRounding off the year, was mainly finising up the larger projects. Tried to hire devs offshore, absolute mess. Tried to charge 200USD for setting up a GitHub repo and 1 meeting - yikes\n\n  \nBuild systems that genuinely worked well. From Automated mood board creation for interior designers, Reactivation campaigns for Mortgage company with Voice AI, Many RAG systems. An SEO blog automation which basically replaced a team … And many smaller jobs here and there.\n\n\n\nLESSONS LEARNT:\n\n* Don’t sell features - if you sell features - you will always add more features to seal the deal\n* Don’t try to rush the delicate art of negotiating a deal. It WILL backfire on you\n* Onboarding hype is REAL for AI projects. Manage expectations ASAP - it will take twice as long and fail in unexpected ways\n* NEVER do free work - 2 weeks to get a demo, then boom ghosted\n* !! Reddit inbound (content) is the way forward !!\n* Have time for play - reset your mind and allows you to get back to “normal”\n* Voice AI is probably the best use case vs effort to implement.\n* Sk00L is SURPRISINGLY good for landing clients\n\n\n\nMY PERSONAL HUNCHES FOR 2026:\n\n* The Claude Code framework will be the default framework for AI agent teams\n* N8N and workflow automation tools will be replaced by agentic / vibe coding (controversial - I know). The hype around April / June was insane, I think it will die down\n* I will enjoy using Lang chain ……. -  this will never happen XD\n\n\n\nInterested to see whose year was a roller coaster as well! \n\n",

A few bucks on an LLM, maybe another tool, and everything feels incremental.\n\nThe real cost shows up when you hit that wall. The code mostly works, the bug is subtle, and the AI keeps guessing.

Translating your objectives to as little code, of as much quality as possible, is the difficult part.\n\n*Every software project has a life expectancy.* Over time, you fix bugs, change things, follow trends, implement features. And inexorably, code quality degrades, more bugs pop up, or you find out that the easy feature is actually super complicated to implement given the current state of the code base.\n\nWhen you are a young inexperienced developer, you code with limited foresight and architecture expertise. The life expectancy of the software is then usually a few months or a year of daily modifications. As you gain experience and skill, your software gets a longer expected lifespan. Top developers that I've met or witnessed the work of (I'm talking open-source project leaders in their fifties) are able to write code with a life expectancy of about 15 to 20 years.\n\nYou see? **At no point I'm saying that producing the code is difficult**. I'm saying that producing code that you will not have to reinvest time into later on is difficult. And, sadly, LLMs are very novice programmers. Yes, they have been trained on lots of code. They know lots of class and function names. But they spit out the most naive solution to your prompt, with no foresight or architecture.\n\nI may be a bit extreme, but for the moment, my evaluations of vibe coding tools and AI-completions in IDEs is quite negative. My colleagues using this experience much lower software life expectancy, and way more bugs. To me, this is injecting poison in your project.",

I think it's partly to get the comfort of hearing about other people doing the same thing, and partly because I want to also be challenged and hence be able to prepare myself better for what's coming.\n\nIn March, I'll be leaving my 72K€/year job (in Spain) as a Product Manager to travel the world with my girlfriend and use a lot of the time to build products myself. I'm 28 years old and really like my job, I really do. At the same time, during the last months I have built a couple of products that get around 150 visits per month (no paid users yet), and it has been really eye-opening on how much I love doing this. I can't stop imagining myself doing this for a living. It's been hard to juggle between a demanding full-time job, social life, and building these products. I feel that if I had more mental capacity to focus on this, I could really make it.\n\nAt the same time, my girlfriend is up to traveling the world and I feel like it's now or never (I have no kids, no debts, no attachments).\n\nI have cash runway for 2–3 years, but my plan is to do this for a year, explore building products more seriously, and discover if I really want to do this full-time. Worst case, I come back to my job or find a new one (I have confidence I can find another one easily).\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share my experience and see if it resonates with someone. Any tips, challenges, will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you and happy building!",

It started as frustration.\n\nWhen my son was born, I tried multiple sleep training methods and courses. Some were too rigid, others too generic, and most relied on “trust the process” without giving parents a real way to understand what was working.\n\nSo I decided to approach the problem differently.\n\nTogether with my sister (a midwife) and a small group of pediatricians and sleep consultants she collaborates with, I developed **PAT Sleep System** — a structured sleep training framework based on experimentation and measurement rather than a single fixed method.\n\nThe core principles:\n\t•\tno one-size-fits-all formula\n\t•\tparents test different approaches\n\t•\tresults are tracked with clear metrics\n\t•\tdecisions are driven by data\n\nThe program runs over 14 days and focuses on teaching babies how to fall asleep independently.\n\nEarly results\n\nWe launched recently, and the first outcomes are honestly very encouraging.\nBabies around 7–8 months are reaching 10–12 hours of uninterrupted night sleep.\n\nAt this stage, I’m less focused on scaling and more on refinement.\n\nWhat I’m working on now\n\t•\timproving the educational materials\n\t•\tsimplifying the framework without losing rigor\n\t•\tcollecting structured feedback from parents\n\t•\tvalidating messaging and positioning\n\nThis is the project if you’re curious it is called The Cozy Knights.\n\nI’m posting here to keep myself accountable and to learn from others who’ve built education or parenting-related businesses.\n\nIf you’ve launched:\n\t•\tdigital courses\n\t•\tevidence-based products\n\t•\tor anything in the parenting space\n\nI’d love to hear what worked (and what didn’t) in your early stages.\n\nI’ll update as things evolve.",

      "text": "I've been working for a few months now on a one-page website builder that creates uniquely designed websites for small businesses with a strong focus on three areas: conversion, good SEO principles and ease of going live. I think the product solidly delivers on all of these.\n\nFrom here on I figured outreach would be the big one right, and I feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing, and keep iterating the product based on feedback I'm getting, trying to reach people for who the product would actually be useful. I feel my issue is that it is hard to actually reach my users. I think, at least initially I should be doing it in person, but right now I'm based in the country of Georgia, where most small businesses have no interest in a website. In my home country in Belgium, it seems like businesses want to have a website, but even the easy fast do it yourself option feels too much work for most of them, so I'm having more success selling the sites all-in for a fixed price. But this also feels off, because I'm basically asking them the input manually and than still use my own tool to make the site for them, so it's hard to price it \"right\" if that makes sense?\n\nI'm now doing cold out reach through Instagram / Messenger / WhatsApp DMs to SMB owners I find on Google Maps that do not have a website yet mainly (I'm also thinking of reaching out to those who already have a website, but a bad / outdated one). The highest reply rate by far is \"Hey, I had a question, do you mind if I ask?\" <- then proceed to ask them about why they don't have a website yet (but this feels like \"tricking\" them, which I don't like). Other outreach approaches seem to have a very low reply rate (I tried short / long / introducing me in detail / not doing that / reaching out with the a free preview offer and than having the option for them to continue building it / have an offer to do it all-in and handle everything for them (of course at a higher price point). But all of those seem to have a very very low reply rate (like less than 5%).\n\nSo I'm wondering looking at competitors like Wix, Squarespace, Durable who have all been able to scale to millions of users, why it's so hard for me to find even one paying user for a product a feel addresses quite a few of the pain points that SMB owners are talking about when using those services. What am I doing wrong? How do you think I should find users for what I have build? Should I just focus on doing the all-in websites (at least initially) as those pay the bills?",

What you are seeing suggests people are willing to pay more to make a problem disappear (than to learn a better way to handle it themselves). Especially smb owners.\n\nWhen someone pays more specifically to not be involved, that tells you something.   \nThey’re not really buying a website, they are buying relief from having to think about websites at all.\n\nThat doesn’t mean your tool or initial idea is wrong. It may just mean the first buyer isn’t the DIY user you imagined, but someone who wants the outcome without the cognitive overhead. a lot of successful software products started as services for exactly this reason.\n\nIt might help to stop asking why won’t they use the tool and instead ask who actually wants this problem off their plate, and when. Those are very different buyers.\n\nIf you zoom out for a moment, do you want the next phase to buy you validation that the tool works, or clarity about who truly wants to own this problem themselves?",

That's not a marketing problem, that's market feedback telling you what they actually value.\n\nThe small businesses you're targeting don't want another tool to learn. They want the website to exist without them thinking about it. Wix and Squarespace scaled with tens of millions in marketing spend and years of brand building, comparing yourself to them is pointless. They also target a different user, someone who actually wants to build their own site.\n\nThe \"tricking\" feeling about your opener is misplaced. Asking someone why they don't have a website isn't manipulation, it's genuine curiosity about their situation. That's just sales.\n\nWith our clients doing productized services the ones who succeed fastest stop fighting what customers are buying. If done-for-you at a fixed price is closing, do that. Price it based on the value of a working website to them, not based on how long it takes you. If your tool lets you build sites in 2 hours that would take someone else 10 hours, that efficiency is your margin.\n\nRun the productized service for 6-12 months, learn what these customers actually need, then decide if the DIY tool still makes sense.

      "text": "I've been thinking about this a lot lately after watching three colleagues nearly lose their businesses to administrative issues that had nothing to do with their actual business performance.\n\nWe've made business formation incredibly accessible - and that's great. You can file an LLC online in under an hour for less than $200 in most states. Every guru on YouTube and TikTok is selling courses on \"how to start your business TODAY\" and it's never been easier to become official.\n\nBut formation is maybe 5% of the actual administrative work.\n\nWhat comes after is this ongoing maze of compliance requirements that most first-time business owners have zero awareness of. Annual reports. Biennial statements. Franchise taxes. BOI filings. Business licenses at city, county, and state levels. Registered agent requirements. Good standing certificates.\n\nAnd here's the kicker - the penalties for missing these aren't proportional to the complexity. A $50 annual report you didn't know existed can result in dissolution of your business. Your LLC status can go from \"active\" to \"delinquent\" while you're busy actually running the company and generating revenue.\n\nI've seen people lose contracts because they couldn't produce a certificate of good standing on demand. I know someone who had their business involuntarily dissolved because compliance notices went to an old address.\n\nThe infrastructure exists to help with this - InCorp as registered agent to handle the ongoing compliance tracking - but most new business owners don't even know this is something they should be budgeting for until they've already missed something critical.\n\nWhy isn't this part of the conversation? Why do we celebrate making formation easy but completely ignore the fact that we're setting people up to fail on the backend?\n\nThoughts?",

One page with: exact legal name, state ID number, registered agent, tax year, deadlines for annual report/franchise tax/BOI, plus links to the state SOS search and local licensing portals. Then:\n1) Put every deadline in a shared calendar with 60/30/7-day reminders.\n2) Use a service that actually explains your obligations in plain English (Northwest for RA, Stripe Atlas for Delaware + early-stage, and doola for non-US founders who need EIN/banking/compliance guardrails instead of just one-off filings).\n3) Once a quarter, spend 30 minutes doing a “good standing” check: state site, RA messages, IRS letters.\nThe main point is compliance should be treated like payroll: invisible, scheduled, and never a surprise.",

Don’t buy courses — if you do this, you probably have way too much to learn about real life first before starting a business and should hyperfocus on getting some street smarts. Last, never work with partners unless you take the time to understand how a corporate structure works — ie. how taxes, private loans, payouts, and salaries are different than ownership % and dividends. If you don’t understand this concept, you have NO business trying to run a business with someone else who owns even 1%",

I’m technically solid: servers, hosting, networking. As a hobby i started web development (Frontend + Backend), built a lot of pages and apps (more fun than business). \n\nBuilding and running things isn’t the issue for me. I want to get out of employment and move toward self-employment. Not because I’m chasing some magic business model or overnight success. I know that doesn’t exist.\n\nBoth of my parents were entrepreneurs as well (different industry, not for me), so I grew up around that mindset. I’m not afraid of hard work, long hours, or slow progress. I just want to build something of my own that actually makes sense.\n\nWhat I’m really after is learning how to identify real niches and real customer problems, and then build products or services that solve those problems and people are willing to pay for. Not once, but repeatedly.\n\nMy current thinking: Focus first on marketing and understanding demand\n\n→ learn how people think, decide, and buy\n→ then build the right product on top of that\n\nNot the other way around.\n\nI’m starting to seriously study marketing and neuromarketing because I want to understand the mechanics, not just copy tactics. I genuinely enjoy these topics and want to develop the skillset to independently find problems, validate them, and build solutions.\n\nSo my questions:\nDoes this order of learning and execution make sense?\nWhat parts of marketing matter most early on for solo founders?\nWhere do technical people like me usually mess this up?\n\nI’m not looking for shortcuts or hype. I’m looking for honest experiences and lessons learned.\n\nAppreciate any input. 🙏",

Your approach totally makes sense: learn what people need first to build solutions second. Most tech founders do the opposite and waste months building something nobody really wants. If you’re starting solo, here’s what I’d focus on early: Talk to people / validate pain points – literally watch them struggle and see if they’d actually pay for a fix. Make your value super clear – can you explain in one sentence why someone should care? If not, hold off building. Run tiny tests – landing pages, surveys, pre-orders, small ad experiments. Quick feedback more important building the full thing. Figure out where your audience hangs out – forums, Discord, Reddit, LinkedIn and test messaging there. Tech people often slip up by overbuilding, adding stuff no one asked for, focusing on nice-to-have instead of must-have, or forgetting that even the best solution fails if it’s hard to find or buy. \n\nHonestly, if you combine your technical skills with really understanding what people want and quick experiments, you’ll avoid most rookie mistakes. What kind of problem or niche are you most interested in exploring first? That’ll help you figure out which marketing pieces to learn first.",

          "text": "This is actually a smart reset, not a downgrade you’re removing ego, sunk-cost bias, and burnout from the equation. A few high-leverage thoughts that might help you get real signal faster with this approach: First, free is fine only if you’re testing the right thing. Page views vs downloads tells you interest, but it doesn’t tell you value. One simple tweak that keeps things lightweight: ask for a tiny commitment before download. Even something like “enter an email to get updates / next version” or a “pay what you want (including $0)” option. People who bother are already a different class of signal. Second, static/offline tools are perfect for sharp, single-pain use cases. The ones that tend to spread are not “productivity tools” but “I built this because I was annoyed by X.” When you post, lead with the irritation, not the tool. People don’t share tools, they share relief. Third, usage more important then downloads is the real boss metric, but it’s invisible unless you design for it. Since you’re offline/no backend, consider baking in something like: a visible “session count” the user sees themselves or a very obvious “did this help?” prompt with a one-click feedback link. It sounds small, but it turns passive users into active signal. Fourth, Gumroad is not just a checkout, it’s a filter. Even when you switch to paid, pricing at $3–$7 will tell you more than free ever will. If someone won’t pay the price of a coffee to remove a real annoyance, the problem probably isn’t strong enough. Two questions that’ll help sharpen the next iteration: What specific moment or frustration made you build this tool for yourself? If this tool disappeared tomorrow, what would you personally be most annoyed to lose? Those answers usually point directly to the version people will actually use and pay for.",

Most indie founders chase “how to grow on X” and forget that “Brandled vs X” traffic is like someone walking into the store with cash in hand. If you haven’t already, add comparison tables, your own data (screenshots, timelines), and a clear “who this is for / who this is not for” on those pages. That filters out bad fits and makes the yes easier.\n\nOn Reddit, one solid post a day is the right move. I’ve seen people mix this with simple tracking in something like Notion + a basic alert stack (Talkwalker, Mention, and Pulse for Reddit) to catch new niche threads and jump in early with useful replies instead of blasting links.\n\nYour real edge now is keeping that “no lying to myself” mindset while you double down on what’s obviously working.",

      "text": "I've been running email and SMS campaigns for ecommerce brands for about a decade now, and 2025 was one of the most interesting years yet.\n\nI worked with about 40 brands this year doing anywhere from $50k to $3M+ annually. Some crushed it. Some struggled. A few went out of business.\n\nHere's what I learned from being inside the backend of all these stores. And what I'm changing in 2026 because of it.\n\nThe Brands That Won Owned Their Audience\n\nThe stores that scaled in 2025 weren't the ones with the best ads. They were the ones that built communities and owned their traffic.\n\nI had a pet brand do $2.5 million in a year after they stopped running ads entirely. How? We built a subreddit, grew it to 20k members, and turned that community into an email list that did 60% of their revenue.\n\nAnother client was a personal trainer who went from $10k to $40k per month by building a Reddit community in his niche. He now books 5 to 10 discovery calls per week just from the engagement in his subreddit.\n\nThe pattern is clear. Brands that rely on rented attention (Meta ads, TikTok, Google) are getting squeezed. CPMs are up. Conversions are down. The ones winning are building owned channels like email lists, SMS lists, Discord servers, Facebook groups, and Reddit communities.\n\nIf your entire business depends on paid ads, 2026 is going to hurt. Start building something you own.\n\n2. Personalization Actually Matters Now\n\nEveryone talks about personalization, but most brands are still sending the same email to everyone.\n\nThis year I started segmenting lists harder than ever. We split buyers by purchase frequency, location, product category, and engagement level.\n\nHere's one example. For a free shipping campaign, instead of sending one email to everyone, we sent three versions:\n\nOne to first time buyers: \"Thanks for your last order. Here's free shipping to try something new.\"\n\nOne to VIPs (2+ purchases): \"Exclusive sale just for you\" with a slightly better offer.\n\nOne to non buyers: \"Now's the best time to try us. No shipping fees.\"\n\nThe result? Open rates went up. Revenue went up. Unsubscribes went down.\n\nEven small things like using the customer's city in the subject line made a difference. \"We're doing free shipping for customers in {{Customers\\_City}}\" consistently doubled open rates compared to generic subject lines.\n\nMost brands have the data to do this. They just don't use it. In 2026, I'm pushing every client to segment harder and personalize more.\n\n3. AI Made Things Faster But Not Better\n\nEvery brand I worked with this year asked me about AI tools for email marketing.\n\nI tested a bunch of them. AI can write decent subject lines, generate email copy, and automate some workflows. It saves time. But it also makes everything sound the same.\n\nThe brands that performed best weren't the ones using AI for everything. They were the ones using AI to speed up grunt work but keeping the human touch in their messaging.\n\nAI can draft an email. But it can't write a founder's personal story. It can't capture the tone of a brand that actually connects with people. And it definitely can't build community.\n\nIn 2026, I'm using AI more for research, data analysis, and automations. But I'm keeping humans in charge of the actual writing and strategy.\n\n4. BFCM Proved That Preparation Beats Discounts\n\nBlack Friday this year separated the prepared from the desperate.\n\nThe brands that planned ahead, segmented their lists, and built anticipation for weeks crushed it. The brands that just sent \"30% off\" emails got mediocre results.\n\nOne thing that worked really well this year was adding a persistent offer banner to every email during BFCM. Even automated flows like welcome sequences and post purchase emails had the sale at the top.\n\nAnother tactic that always works: resending high performing campaigns with new subject lines. Same email. Same list. Different hook. It added 25 to 50% more revenue every time.\n\nThe brands that treated BFCM like a one day event lost. The brands that treated it like a two week campaign with multiple touchpoints won.\n\nIn 2026, I'm starting BFCM planning in September. Not November.\n\n5. Most Brands Are Ignoring Their Best Customers\n\nThis one surprised me. A lot of brands are so focused on new customer acquisition that they forget about the people who already bought from them.\n\nYour best customers are the ones who already trust you. They convert faster. They spend more. They refer people. And most brands barely talk to them.\n\nThis year I started building VIP segments for every client. People who've purchased 2+ times get different treatment. Early access to sales. Exclusive offers. Personal thank you emails.\n\nOne brand sent a plain text thank you email after BFCM with no pitch, no sale, just gratitude. It was the highest revenue email they sent all year. People responded saying they appreciated being treated like a person, not a wallet.\n\nIn 2026, I'm pushing every brand to build better retention systems for existing customers. New customers are expensive. Repeat customers are profit.\n\n6. Community Beats Content Every Time\n\nI spent years telling brands to create more content. Post more on Instagram. Make more TikToks. Send more emails.\n\nBut 2024 taught me something different. Community beats content.\n\nA brand with 500 engaged community members in a Discord or Reddit group will outperform a brand with 50k Instagram followers who don't care.\n\nThe reason? Community creates loyalty. It turns customers into advocates. It gives you direct feedback. It makes people feel like they're part of something.\n\nOne of my clients built a Facebook group for their niche. It's now 10k members. Those members generate user content, answer each other's questions, and defend the brand when someone complains. That's worth more than any ad campaign.\n\nIn 2026, I'm helping every client build or grow a community. Reddit, Discord, Facebook groups, whatever fits. But community first, content second.\n\n7. The Backend Is Where the Real Money Is\n\nMost brands obsess over their homepage, their product pages, and their ads. And yeah, those matter.\n\nBut the brands that made the most money this year were the ones that optimized their backend. Email flows, post purchase sequences, win back campaigns, and retention systems.\n\nI've seen brands flip from 20% email revenue to 60% email revenue just by building proper welcome flows, abandoned cart sequences, and post purchase nurtures.\n\nOne client was doing $100k per month with 80% of sales coming from ads. After we rebuilt their email system, they're now doing $150k per month with 60% coming from email and retention. Their ad spend went down. Their profit went up.\n\nThe lesson? Your backend is your profit center. Optimize it first.\n\nIn 2026, I'm spending less time on growth hacks and more time on backend systems that compound.\n\nWhat I'm Changing in 2026\n\nBased on everything I learned this year, here's what I'm doing differently:\n\nBuilding communities first, ads second. Every client is getting a Reddit or Discord strategy.\n\nSegmenting harder. No more one size fits all emails.\n\nUsing AI for speed, not strategy. Humans write. AI assists.\n\nPlanning BFCM in September. Not scrambling in October.\n\nTreating VIP customers like VIPs. Retention over acquisition.\n\nOptimizing backends first. Growth comes after systems are solid.\n\nIf you're running an ecommerce brand or thinking about starting one, don't chase the shiny stuff in 2026. Build systems that compound. Own your audience. Treat your customers like people.\n\nThat's what worked in 2025. And that's what's going to work even better in 2026.",

I work a retail job next to school and make around 600–700€ a month.\n\nSince I was like 13–14 I’ve been obsessed with the idea of building something on my own. Not just money, but having a project, something I can work on every day and slowly grow over time.\n\nThe problem is: I have no idea what that should be.\n\nI tried some stuff. Clothing reselling, different jobs since I was 15. I even had phases where I made decent money. But when I look back now, I feel stupid seeing that only around 300€ are left. I did pay my driver’s license, vacations, daily stuff etc., so it’s not like I wasted everything — still feels bad for the amount of work.\n\nEverything I look at now feels oversaturated. Social media, ecom, agencies, all that. Nothing really clicks. I don’t even know my real strengths. I’m pretty insecure about that tbh.\n\nI try to improve myself, read, work, think long term. My biggest problem is probably phone addiction and distraction. I’m working on it, but yeah.\n\nI also compare myself a lot to people online who seem to “have it figured out”, which doesn’t help.\n\nI don’t want to jump from hype to hype or waste the next years trying random things with no direction.\n\nSo my question is:\n\nHow did you find the right business or direction for yourself?

Learn to sell, learn to write, learn basic design or coding. These compound regardless of what direction you eventually pick. With our clients the founders who succeed fastest usually spent years getting good at something specific before they started a business around it.\n\nThe comparing yourself to people online thing is poison. Most of those \"I made six figures at 19\" stories are either fake, exaggerated, or leave out the part where they had wealthy parents funding their experiments. Stop consuming that content entirely for a few months and see how your thinking changes.\n\nThe €300 remaining after paying for a license, vacations, and life isn't failure. You're 18 and net positive after years of trying things. Most people your age have tried nothing.\n\nThe \"right business\" usually reveals itself through experience and skills, not through sitting and thinking about what market to enter.",

They start with ambiguity.\n\nHere are the patterns I kept noticing.\n\nWork begins before money is actually locked.  \nIt’s framed as “just to get started” or “we’ll settle payment after a quick sample.” Once work starts, leverage quietly disappears.\n\nPayment methods allow one side to reverse decisions.  \nChargebacks or vague buyer protection mean delivery doesn’t actually guarantee payment.\n\nScope creeps in through conversation.  \n“What do you think about…” turns into real work without anyone clearly agreeing it’s billable.\n\nThere’s no shared definition of “done.”  \nIf delivery and approval aren’t explicit, payment becomes subjective. That’s where most arguments stall.\n\nAfter seeing this enough times, I changed one rule for myself.\n\nI don’t start work unless funds are locked first and tied to a clearly defined scope. Delivery and approval are explicit. When “done” is clear, payment stops being emotional.\n\nFor recent off-platform work, I started using an escrow style vault setup, the rule is: lock the money to the scope before work starts.\n\nCurious how other founders here handle off-platform work, or if you’ve found better ways to eliminate payment friction entirely.",

We’ve been growing slowly, and even though we have fewer clients than big agencies, we make a good profit because we can deliver the same quality as a US editor for a much lower cost around $500/month instead of $5k/month.\n\nOur team is fully remote, which works most of the time, but sometimes it causes delays. We’ve even lost a few potential projects because of this. We think having a small onsite team could help us take on bigger projects and work faster.\n\nWe’re also wondering about small ways to get support or investment to grow, but we know most investors prefer brand-new startups. Any advice on how to find investors or partners who support growing businesses like ours would be really helpful.\n\nWe’d love to hear from anyone who has experience with scaling a service business or growing a small agency.

      "text": "This is a summary of the past months for my hardware project. I hope that some of this story will be useful to people, and I highly invite people to comment and challenge my understanding of the events.\n\nI'm an engineer, not a business person, so I may have mis-interpreted some signals.\n\n**My original plan was \"the waterfall\"** and building in secret. I'm a researcher. For my entire career, projects were very well sequenced. First we come up with an idea, then we write a long research proposal that explains what will be done, how it is going to be done, and what we will do in case it does not work. Then we apply for funding. Hopefully, we get the funding, we start doing the research, and a few years later, we publish the papers and submit the deliverables. At that point, we start looking at valorization. The important point here is that we get the funding before research happens, and we never try to market something that is not proven to exist.\n\nFor my hardware project, I wanted to follow the same path: build a working demonstrator, churn the numbers, look for investors, raise money, then start working full-time on the project without talking too much about it (better engineering, procurement, certification). Then, once the product is finished and in stock, start selling it.\n\nEarly in my project, **my colleagues in business told me that this is way too risky**. We have to establish proof of product-market fit much earlier than once the product is finished, certified and in stock. So I was invited to stop all my engineering activities and focus on business and marketing: company incorporation, legal stuff, making a webshop, 3D renders of the product, blog posts, social media posts, a press kit, and then focus on online marketing (making ads, including videos of me) to get people to preorder the product. I was told by numerous people to wait for these preorders before going back to \"engineering\" mode and spending any amount of money on engineering.\n\nFast forward a few months and my communication is up and running. But there is an unforeseen problem: **people do indeed have the problem** for which I'm building a solution, but **they don't trust that my solution will work**, or will solve their problem.\n\n**It is a hardware product.** People stand on it and entrust it with their physical safety. It is not an online tool that is easy to try out. It appeared that for most people to even consider preordering this product, they had to have strong proof that the product will work. Stronger proof than what a demonstrator or engineering sample can provide:\n\n* Non-staged videos of someone using it, full power, all features.\n* Various people, of various body shapes and fitness, using the product with ease. In various contexts. Rainy days included.\n* Real users or small influencers doing unbiased reviews, for people to believe that the product actually manages to do what it says it does.\n\n\n\nSee the problem? **For people to consider purchasing or preordering my product, well, the product needs to exist**. Maybe not yet certified and mass-produced, but at least \"works-like\" and \"looks-like\".\n\nSo, at least, the engineer in me is very happy, because I can do engineering again and solve little but important details that I originally left for later. Examples:\n\n* Proper firmware with proper fault tolerance and diagnostics, so I can give the product to people for a day and have high probabilities of getting the product back at the end of the day, in working order, and have the user still in working order too.\n* Proper esthetics, at least 80% of the way to \"retail\". Seeing some cables is fine, but one of the main point of the product is that it is small and lightweight. So, if I build a bulky prototype, it defeats the purpose.\n* Very specific, but I find it funny: the product attaches to the user. How? Well, that is a complicated matter. Straps, hooks, ratchets, all of them come in various sizes, shapes, materials, colors. I've shown the product to several external people, and they understandably would not trust a product that falls off or hurts when in use.\n\nThis last point (the attachment) cannot be studied on a computer. I have to buy or make all these attachments and try them, and feel, myself and other people around me, how easy it is to use, how well it attaches, how safe it makes me feel, how nice it looks, ... .\n\nSo, sorry for the very long post. But did any of you live through something like this (hardware or software)? What did you end up doing? Am I doing it wrong?\n\n(I already mentioned the \"the product needs to exist\" problem on r/Entrepreneur a few weeks ago; this post reflects progress that was accomplished since then: confirmation from several sources that a nice prototype is required fast, and work in that direction)",

With our clients building local networks the pattern is always the same: show up, be helpful, ask good questions, follow up.\n\nOffer value even when you think you have none.
