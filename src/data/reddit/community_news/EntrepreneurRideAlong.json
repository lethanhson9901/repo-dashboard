      "text": "hey everyone.\n\ni'm a high school student from argentina. down here, things are pretty volatile economically, so i realized early on that if i wanted to build a future, i needed to learn skills that worked globally.\n\nlast year, i took harvard's cs50p (free on youtube). i became obsessed with the idea that \"if you do it more than twice, you should script it.\"\n\ni wanted to share the projects i've built in the last few months to test my skills in the real world. maybe this inspires other teenagers to start coding.\n\n\\*\\*1. the \"virtual photographer\" (computer vision)\\*\\*\n\na local clothing brand was spending a fortune on photoshoots. i wrote a pipeline that takes a messy flat-lay photo of a t-shirt on a table, cleans it, and uses ai to put it on a realistic virtual model.\n\n\\*tech:\\* python, comfyui logic, custom upscaling for skin texture.\n\n\\*result:\\* they stopped hiring models.\n\n\\*\\*2. the \"seo watchdog\" (automation)\\*\\*\n\ni realized manual seo tracking is boring and expensive. i built a script that scrapes google search results for specific keywords daily and logs the ranking changes in a simple dashboard, alerting if a competitor moves up.\n\n\\*tech:\\* beautifulsoup, python, telegram api for alerts.\n\n\\*\\*3. the \"lead hunter\" (scraping)\\*\\*\n\ni needed to find local businesses to talk to, so i built a bot that scrapes google maps for specific niches (like \"plumbers in \\[city\\]\"), extracts their emails, and verifies if they are active.\n\n\\*\\*what i learned:\\*\\*\n\nthe code itself isn't the hard part. the hard part is understanding the business problem (like \"photos are expensive\" or \"data entry is boring\") and translating that into logic.\n\ni'm currently diving into 3d engineering automation (rhino/grasshopper) for a new challenge.\n\njust wanted to share my journey so far. if you are young and hesitating to learn python: just start. it literally changes how you see the world.",

Money went to contractors and software + ads which to be fair had a 3:1 ROI but now I'm looking at the numbers and wondering where it all went  \n  \nMy friends hear $300k and think I'm doing great when in reality I'm making less than my last job and working way harder. My girlfriend keeps asking when things will get easier financially and I don't have an answer  \n  \nI can't figure out what I should've done differently because the contractor and software wasn't optional but watching $235k disappear into business expenses feels wrong Is 20% take home normal or am I stupid?",

Those two agencies need to have separate meetings with one another since they’re working together, this is crucial.\n\nMake sure your agencies are communicating with each other at least bi weekly. It’s their job to know what information should reach you and every other role involved. A good reference would be a Stakholder mapping, this is basically a guide to which stakeholders should know what.\n\nThe only issue is communication and i’m sure if you take my advice this will help you significantly.

For example, if it's contract labor - can contractor expense be reduced and/or replaced with less costly providers. In other words, if you are using software the question is why would you need expensive contractors?\n\nThird: Operational overview are you optimizing your systems/process and/or what can be consolidated or automated.\n\nHope this helps.",

Just out of interest, would working on the brand equity and sharper positioning of your content agency enable you to appear as a more premium option against competitors and therefore charge more, and create more of a demand for your services? With our knowledge of this exact space and a common issue you're facing, it can be a real game changer (especially for agencies as what they see, is how they choose what you're worth up front) and then the extra revenue can allow for faster scaling, and subsequently a faster rise in take home.

Most agencies are going to net anywhere from 15-25% depending on how good of controls you have in place. I would say you should review your costs as there is probably some leakage in there. There may be another point or two in there.\n\nFor the most part though the thing post people don’t talk about are things like taxes and benefits and so on that when you’re an employee you don’t recognize. Also the infrastructure and marketing to drive the business have a cost that a lot of people don’t think about when they are an employee.\n\nAll and all, you’re doing well it just takes time to get where you actually want to be.",

Receiving that email was one of the best days of my career and a major moment for our company. \n\nIt took about 3-4 weeks to go through diligence and agree on the deal points. It was a Tuesday evening that we finally agreed to everything over a call and I was told that Docusign would be sent the next day and funds wired Friday. \n\nThursday comes and still no Docusign. I email to check in with leadership, and everything seemed on track just delayed with upcoming holidays. \n\nThen Monday arrives with a phone call. When I answer, the venture team asks me to google their company to see a press release. I then come to find out that they had taken a human first position as a company and are not touching AI, which somehow the venture team had no idea…our platform is an AI interactive media platform for superfans to create music, stories, etc inside licensed franchise IP. \n\nMy lesson. Take the damn deal, because it might not be there again in 3 weeks. \n\nNot slowing us down, just changes a few things temporarily. ",

That made me rethink how I evaluate opportunities.\n\nRecently, while exploring StartupIdeas DB which I found on google, I decided to ignore trendy or flashy concepts and focus only on products that already exist and are already generating revenue. Real SaaS products with real customers.\n\nOne idea in their tech category stood out. It was a simple B2B SaaS solving a boring but painful operational problem. No hype, no complex positioning. Just a clear solution people were willing to pay for.\n\nI will not share the exact idea publicly, but there are many similar examples available.\n\nOnce a product is making money, the question of whether the idea is valid is mostly answered. The problem is real, customers are paying, and some form of distribution already exists, even if it is small.\n\nSaaS makes this approach practical. Today it is easier than ever to build, test, and improve products. This is not about copying a business, but about learning from existing validation and executing better for a specific niche through focus, experience, or distribution.\n\nI am seriously considering building something inspired by this approach, not because it is trendy, but because the proof already exists.\n\nCurious to hear thoughts from others here. Do you prefer starting with proven revenue or trying to build something completely new?",

While all of that may be true, to many regular people watching YouTube, their identity has never been stolen and they don't know of anyone's identity who has - so the education is meaningless and the pain isn't real (to them).\n\nBut Incogni has bucketloads to spend on advertising for their idea: many founders don't have this. So if you have to educate leads before getting them to buy, you lose all of the people who couldn't care to buy into a problem that hasn't affected them yet. This can be a lot, and as a startup, OC argues that the pain isn't real enough if you have to tell people they have a problem",

They have an idea for something, they think it's unique and never been done before. Once they finally do some research, they learn that there are plenty of people already doing it and give up.    \n    \nThat is the opposite of the correct reaction. If you come up with an idea for something, and you learn other people are already doing it, that is market validation. The thing you came up with is a valid business idea that people already pay for. That's great!   \n    \nPhil Knight has an estimated net worth of $35B (down from $50B) and Nike is worth an estimated $100B. Imagine if he had never started the company because shoes already existed. That would be stupid, right? Lots of wantrepreneurs conceptually do the same thing as not making Nike because shoes existed every day.   \n    \nBut, if you genuinely come up with something new and cannot find a single other company doing it, that is a red flag. Now, yes, it is possible that you've actually stumbled on something new and brilliant, but the reality is that that is incredibly unlikely. To be perfectly frank, most people don't have original thoughts. That's not an insult, it's just reality. And even if you have found something actually new that hasn't been done before, it can be very difficult to get traction. Instead of convincing someone to buy A over B and listing out reasons why A is better, you have to convince them to buy A over not spending money.    \n  \nSticking with the shoe example, a company doesn't need to convince you why you need to buy shoes in the first place, they just need to convince you why to buy *their* shoes, which is much easier.     \n    \nIn the overwhelming majority of cases, if you cannot find a single other company doing what you intend to do, then there's a reason people aren't doing it and you need to figure out why.",

The interesting pattern is that every “tier 3” play you mentioned has two common pieces: repeatable data flow + a predictable distribution channel. If someone wants to copy this, I’d do it backwards: pick a narrow buyer first (ecom brand owner, local lawyer, SaaS founder), then map one painful recurring task they already pay for (content, lead lists, reporting). After that, prototype the fulfillment in a weekend using Gemini/Claude + no-code (n8n, Make, etc.), and only once it works manually, wire up your hunter scripts and outreach on Reddit/LinkedIn. I’ve used PhantomBuster and Clay for that, but Pulse for Reddit plus Apollo-style email has been way more useful when I want to find real demand signals and plug into live conversations instead of cold pitching in a vacuum. Owning a boring, automated pipeline for one niche wins every time over chasing “high-income skills.",

      "text": "I have been running a dev agency for more than 4 years now, and yes, it is a real business. At one point, I had around 10 people on the team, and we were making 6–7 thousand USD per month (I’m from a third‑world country, Azerbaijan, where the average salary is around 400–600 USD). However, it was tough. Managing a team and constantly searching for clients drained a lot of energy and time.\n\nI had what many would call a “dream life”: I could control how and when I worked, technically decide when to take a vacation, and be my own boss. But the reality was different. I didn’t have true freedom. My life slowly became my business.\n\nMy story isn’t unique, I know that. Many smart people warned me that this path wasn’t sustainable and wouldn’t give me real freedom or anything close to passive income. Still, I continued running the business and even expanded to the UK to get easier access to European clients.\n\nThen AI hit hard. Yes, I know it’s been around for more than three years, but its true potential really became clear with the release of ChatGPT 5 and now Opus 4.5, which gives a glimpse of what AGI might look like. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, take a look at tech Twitter - Opus 4.5 can genuinely function as an assistant now with some setup.\n\nI’ve been a developer since I was 13 (25 now), and I know from experience that professional development is hard and time‑consuming. But recent advances in AI have significantly eased the entire process. Today, it’s actually possible to build an MVP, or even a fairly complex SaaS platform - in weeks, or at most a few months. We’ve already done this multiple times, and that’s when I realized it was time to shift.\n\nThe shift was toward focusing on building my own products and removing my dependence on clients.\n\nOver the last six months, I’ve strategically started reducing the size of my team. It was a tough decision, but to make this transition, I needed to lower my running costs. Now I’ve settled on having one junior developer who helps with simple tasks. I’m heavily training her to use AI and leverage the technology as much as possible, and I’ve kept an accountant to handle all legal matters. This month alone, I’ve already built one product, and the second one is currently in progress.\n\nMy recommendation to anyone thinking about starting an agency: think very carefully about what kind of freedom you’re actually aiming for. True freedom is much harder to achieve through an agency than it looks from the outside. In most cases, you’re simply replacing a boss with clients, deadlines, and constant operational pressure.\n\nIf freedom, control over your time, focus, and mental energy is your real goal, it increasingly seems easier to achieve it by building small apps, experimenting with different SaaS products, and creating assets that don’t depend on constant client work. An agency can work, but it has to stay small, highly optimized, and focused on high‑paying customers. Otherwise, it’s very easy to build yourself another full‑time job instead of the freedom you were looking for.",

But eventually you can burn out, particularly if you are both chasing and delivering the service.  \n\nIf you are a creative person who really cares about your clients, you will also tire of always having to explain the various options to every client — and then worry that they will go against your recommendations.

      "text": "Honestly, I’m so happy I went ahead with that idea of getting a few 20 seater buses earlier this year. It wasn’t even some grand business plan at first. It was just me thinking about how every December comes with the same drama: no buses anywhere and transport fares jumping like crazy. I figured instead of complaining again this year, why not fill the gap?  So I just went for it. I got the buses, did all the registration wahala, and placed them at strategic spots around town. And let me tell you, this thing picked up faster than I expected. We are  not even in the peak festive rush yet, but the returns have already been solid. People need transport every day, and the demand has been consistent.   The funny part is that the first set I ordered from Alibaba has already gone up in price. That alone made me realize something important. If you sit on an idea for too long, life will move on without you. Execution will always beat overthinking.   I have  told  few friends the same thing. Stop waiting for the perfect moment. Just start. This transport venture wasn’t even in my plans for the year, but it’s turning out to be one of the smartest moves I made.  Sometimes the best wins come from the decisions you don’t overthink.",

Revenue hit $12k this month which is great, but I hired my first employee (finally) and realized my phone setup was completely inadequate for a two-person operation.\n\nI was still using my cell phone for everything. When I hired Sarah, I had to give her my personal number to use when customers called during her shifts. This obviously sucked for multiple reasons. Customers would text my personal phone at weird hours, Sarah did not have access to voicemail, and I had no way to track which calls she was taking versus which ones I was handling.\n\nSpent a few days this month getting a real business phone system sorted. Now we have a main business number, both of us can answer from our own phones, and there is proper voicemail that we can both access. Small thing but it made me feel like an actual business instead of a guy with a mop.\n\nLesson learned is you do not realize how janky your solo setup is until you try to bring someone else into it. Fix the infrastructure before you hire, not after.",

Like, anyone can prompt their way to a working feature now. That's just the reality. But I keep running into devs who can ship stuff but can't explain why they built it that way. Ask them what happens under load or why they picked one approach over another and there's just nothing there.\n\n\n\nAnd the thing is, on day one it all looks the same. Working code is working code. But a few months down the line when something breaks or a requirement changes, you start seeing who actually understood what they built vs who just got lucky with the output.\n\n\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is AI raised the floor massively but the ceiling is still the same. Everyone can build now. But building something that doesn't fall apart when reality hits? That's still hard.

For finding partners, I’ve seen the best luck in niche Discords, founder Slacks, and communities like Indie Hackers; tools like Apollo and Clay help with outreach, and I’ve used things like PhantomBuster, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and Pulse alongside them to spot high-intent people who are already talking about similar problems. So yeah, very open to a deeper chat if we both stay brutally honest about time, ownership, and expectations from day one.",

Those 5–10 people on calls are way more honest because they already put down a card.\n\n\n\nTools like Apollo for prospect lists, Lemlist/Instantly for outbound, and Pulse plus normal Reddit search to find real buying-intent threads make this way more repeatable without you living in DMs all day.\n\n\n\nMain point: conversations are great, but conversations plus tiny paywalls expose real demand way faster.",

      "text": "I’m looking for advice from people who are building businesses, side hustles, or long-term financial independence—especially those who’ve had to make hard trade-offs.\n\n# My primary goal (top priority):\n\n**Building long-term financial independence through trading and entrepreneurship**\n\nI’m heavily focused on:\n\n* Researching financial markets (stocks & options)\n* Developing and testing trading strategies\n* Working toward becoming a consistently profitable trader\n* Long-term goal: starting my own trading firm once I’ve proven edge and consistency\n\nThis requires deep focus, long hours, and sustained mental energy. I don’t see this as a “side project” — it’s something I want to build my life around.\n\n# Other important (but supporting) goals:\n\n1. **Career stability to support entrepreneurship** \\- I have a job offer in Spain and plan to move and settle there. That means:\n   * Learning Spanish seriously\n   * Doing well at my job so that I have a good position within the firm.\n   * Being good at my job reduces the possibility of layoff in the future and being good at Spanish will help in case I lose my job and have to find a new one. It also helps with applying for the Permanent Residence (PR) and eventually for the Spanish passport.\n   * My point is - If my goal is to relocate to Spain, I am going to have to spend a considerable amount of time and effort into doing the things that are going to help me in achieving this goal.\n2. **Health, fitness, and longevity** \\- Regular gym, disciplined workouts, good diet. This is non-negotiable because poor health destroys long-term performance.\n3. **Relationships and social life** \\- Building a healthy relationship, socializing, meeting people, and eventually finding a life partner. Important, but also time- and energy-intensive.\n\n# The conflict:\n\nAlongside all of this, I have hobbies:\n\n* Badminton\n* Social dancing (salsa, bachata, kizomba)\n* Occasionally chess\n\nThe issue is that hobbies aren’t free. They require real time and effort, and sometimes money (classes, events, practice). Any time spent here is time *not* spent improving my trading edge, researching markets, or compounding skill.\n\nOne important clarification:  \nI actually enjoy the process of building my goals. I like researching markets, developing strategies, working out, and improving myself. This isn’t a misery vs pleasure trade-off.\n\nHobbies, on the other hand, are enjoyable but non-compounding. I’ll never be a professional dancer or athlete. They don’t create leverage, income, or long-term advantage—just short-term enjoyment.\n\n# The real question:\n\nAmong entrepreneurs, it’s often said that success requires obsession, focus, and sacrifice.\n\nSo I’m asking this directly:\n\n**Is completely cutting out hobbies a reasonable—or even necessary—cost of building something meaningful?**\n\nNot reducing them.  \nNot “balancing” them nicely.  \nBut intentionally eliminating them (at least temporarily) to maximize focus and execution.\n\nI’m worried that trying to balance too many things leads to being average at everything—especially in something as competitive as trading and entrepreneurship.\n\n# Questions for those further along:\n\n* Did you sacrifice hobbies while building your business or side hustle? If yes, was it temporary or long-term?\n* Did it materially speed up your progress?\n* At what point do hobbies become a distraction rather than recovery?\n* Is “work–life balance” overrated in the early stages of building something real?\n\n\n\nI understand the theoretical answer to this dilemma. As far as I know, the “correct” solution is to maintain some kind of balance—something like 70–30 or 80–20, where 70–80% of your time and effort goes toward goals and 20–30% goes toward hobbies. Even a 50–50 balance can make sense for some people. I understand that. I really do.\n\n\n\nBut what I’ve observed in real life is this:  \nPeople who try to balance too many things at once often don’t truly excel at the few things they actually want most. They stay average across the board. And that’s exactly what I don’t want.",

It just depends on how bad you want it. If you start a business and dedicate 1-2 hours a day, yes it might work, but you have a substantially lower chance of it working than someone who lives and breathes that business and works 15 hours a day. \n\nIt just depends on your personal goal.

          "text": "I've been in business for almost two years, from the idealism at the beginning to the trough of front-end time, and then to today I understand a little truth. It's hard to get rich all at once, and it's similar to buying a lottery ticket. The real appearance of entrepreneurship is likely to be to cultivate a certain direction or constantly integrate resources, and entrepreneurship is a marathon race that tests endurance rather than a sprint.\n\nFrom the excitement at the beginning to the loss later, I had to reflect on whether there was a problem with relying on short-lived passions. I can easily get excited and then work hard for half a month to three months, sleeping only 4-5 hours a day for several weeks, but the results of these sprints were failures. The answer is obvious, this is not true, I try to cover up my ideological laziness with action efforts, and I devote all my passion to entrepreneurship in a very small part of what I am best at - technology research and development. I made a mistake; I made the mistake of comforting myself.\n\nMy current understanding is that the key to running a marathon is to be persistent, and persistence cannot rely on passion, and you cannot always force yourself and suppress yourself when it is not necessary. You need to find a balance, a balance with the highest efficiency, and balance relaxation and work. It doesn't sound right, and now I think it's far better to stick with it than to try to rush and then fail.\n\nSecondly, entrepreneurship is mental work, and it is not difficult to find an idea that excites you, but the difficult thing is how to constantly screen and verify the commercial viability of this idea. I need to keep learning and understanding relevant knowledge, and I need to really find people related to the problem to understand and communicate. I used to think that \"doing as you go\" and \"being willing to accept imperfection\" meant that you should act on your ideas immediately. But I was wrong, the real thing should be: study carefully first, then verify carefully, and then try and make mistakes quickly on a minimum scale. We often hear the last part, and the first part is not taken seriously. I think the idea of a great product must not be determined in 2 weeks, and we cannot ignore the channels mastered by experienced product managers and the time acceleration brought by experience.\n\nFinally, back to your question, I think your hobbies allow you to reach more good, different people, which can be perfectly integrated into your goals. I mean, we should look at issues from multiple perspectives, and the final decision should serve our long-term goals; that's all that matters.",

          "text": "I read about half of your post.But as someone that has a lot of experience with a large family, a few hobbies, and a large business, as well as other assets....\n\nThere is no balance. There is seasons where things will be more balanced. It's not the beginning though. The first four or five years.You'll need to go hard if you're gonna make money. \n\nYou can jungle a relationship.But you need to make damn sure that that person understands the ride that they're about to join for the rest of their life with you. \n\nAs far as hobbies go, just cut that idea out same with social stuff. If you keep things as a side gig, then you might be able to juggle them. Working full time and building a business.You're not going to have time to do hobbies. I climbed and surfed professionally from a young teenager into my early twenties. I'm good and have a strong passion for the outdoors. \n\nI was not able to find any way to include hobbies on my journey. At 38 I started my current business. I achieved fuck you money a few years ago. I went out and I spent a few thousand dollars replacing all of my rock.Climbing and big wall climbing gear for myself, and some of my older children. I bought new kites surfing rigs.I bought new surfboards.I bought new wetsuits.I bought all the stuff.\n\nMy day usually ends in the late afternoon. And I go locally to some cliffs within thirty minutes, and I put up new routes with a buddy a couple times a month currently. I take at least two trips a year to climb remote big walls. Usually there's five or six surfing endeavours in different countries on trips that I take with my wife and children. If there's a significant event for occasion or for surfing a swell, I will jump on a small plain and fly to wherever it's at. I can afford these things because I control my time and money. They are not my primary focus, though.My family is, and then my business.\n\nI would not have gotten here if I had tried to balance and have the happy lifestyle.That everyone wants to achieve. If you read biographies of all the greatest people throughout history in any endeavor you will see that this is true.\n\nI spin all the plates as well as I can. And as I drop them, I lean down to pick them up. Whether it be family or spouse or focused time with one of my 10 children, or business.... I pieced the plate back together, and then I started spinning.But while I do this, other plates start to fall.\n\nI have an amazing wife that understood the hell that we were gonna go through for a while to get to where we are now. She was already retired as being a college professor and was rate or traveled the world and her three children were already grown. My youngest of the 6kids I brought to the marriage was 1 at the time. Not only did she have to be willing to eat the shit sandwiches for years and years, and possibly not ever reached the promised land. She had to be willing to start over in parenthood. After raising three kids successfully through college.\n\nShe is my ride or die. She travels a lot more than I do.Because she teaches our youngest homeschooling. World schooling is more apt because last year alone they took 19 trips with 9 of them being 3-4 weeks long each. She just got back from a month long trip.Studying the mayans in the yucatan, with my youngest daughter, and then she's in oklahoma with our adult son and visiting her grandkids.Before she comes home tonight. I think she has a trip to new mexico and washington state coming up before germany later in the spring. I go on some of the trips and other ones.I stay back to grow the company and I'll fly in to wherever they're at with our other children. Sometimes I fly out my adult children with the grandkids, and sometimes it's just the grandkids.\n\nYou gotta get to the point where you have the control to do all the things. In the beginning, the focus is building the skill sets and the knowledge. And the character and the experience to even get to the starting line. And then you have to get traction, and then you have to survive the first five years of scaling.\n\nIt's worth it.",

I didn't cut out my hobbies completely right from the start, but I genuinely love what I do, and I gradually carve out more time to focus on building saas, running a business and it's just natural for me to spend less time on other things, or find a replacement for them.\n\n2. Did I sacrifice my hobby? I wouldn't say I sacrificed my hobbies. I used to do powerlifting, but I am getting old and my mindset shifted. Instead of lifting heavy all the time, I want to be more flexible, have more endurance. my goal changed, so does my workout and how I fit it into my day\n\n3. Did it speed up my process? Yes, powerlifting takes up 2 hours per sesh. But if I just stretch and do bodyweight exercises, it takes considerably less time, but again, it was a natural progression for me to go from powerlifting to bodyweight exercises\n\n4. There's no work life balance. I have a young family, so it's just work, take care of family, try to eat healthy, try to do some exercise everyday, and hope that I can fall asleep at night. I don't sleep well. I think about my work a lot. It's rare for me to even go out with friends these days. \n\nI guess we are all just trying our best to make it, so best of luck to you, friend",

          "text": "Yeah I think it’s a great question. The responses here so far, especially the ones dismissing your point, aren’t discussing power dynamics, which is what you’re describing. Basically, if you hire people better than you, why should they continue to work for you and not take over your job? \n\nThe answer is that you need to bring something to the table. You have to be more visionary, or be willing to work harder so you stay ahead of them, or be willing to do things they don’t want to do, or have so much charisma that you bring intangible value by charming your customers and stakeholders, or some other thing. \n\nA negative strategy you might employ would be to gatekeep information from those employees who are better than you in an effort to hold them down. This would just create a toxic environment. A positive strategy is to acknowledge people’s strengths and to give them more responsibility as the business grows, so they continue to feel heard and supported. Growth is a salve that heals many problems, especially power dynamics. \n\nAlso, it is definitely true that founders are replaced after the company grows if they can no longer add value. Not every founder is meant to be a CEO and that’s okay. Founders can be great visionaries and sales people but cant always scale after achieving initial success and product-market fit. Despite the harm to their ego, this can be good for the founder if they retain their share in the company because their financial wealth increases by promoting someone else into their role to run the company. \n\nI often wonder how Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang retained their roles despite hiring a zillion brilliant people.",

The average age of the 30 person company was 35. The best COO for the job was a 54 year old old who had a team player attitude. The CEO passed for fear that he would try to want to be the CEO. Long story short, a year later the CEO got fired because he missed something that a season COO would NOT have missed. Now having said that, I have seen people hire strong technical talent who would either not be a team player or was so certain they were right all the time that they fought the whole company. So yes to the skill, but they must have a team attitude.",
