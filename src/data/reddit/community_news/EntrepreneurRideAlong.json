          "text": "Oh we definitely did and still pay monthly for most of the agents we use tbh! I just looked at our billing dashboard and here are the ones that stood out:\n\n1. Gamma: Great for automating making presentations! Gamma created a fully designed presentation for me (including all the content) from a one line prompt in 90 seconds. This was damn impressive!   \n2. Windsurf/Cursor: Everyone in our team gets either Windsurf or Cursor, which has literally tripled our developer output. We ship products much faster now. Personally I am huge fan of Windsurf Cascade agent that as been able to pull off large changes to our production app from a single prompt! But some prefer Cursor!  \n3. Lovable/Bolt: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff!  \n4. Frizerly: I have an automation using Frizerly AI agent that pulls all our Google search console data, and comes up with a strategy for blogs on our website based on last months changes and current strategy. It then auto publishes a blog daily on our wordpress website! It can also generate and publish instagram posts weekly using our exact product images that mostly involves educational content! \n5. Clay: We have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point.\n6. Google Nano Banana: Google Nano Banana has been a game changer in helping us create marketing assets from scratch with simple product images. It can easily turn simple images to full blown product shoots!  \n\n \n\nWould love to learn what others are paying for as well!",

It was a small B2C SaaS that was already making around **$500/month**. Nothing crazy as such, but it was real revenue.\n\nAnd that I exited at 6 figures.\n\nSince then, I’ve bought **5 more businesses**, all for **under $10k**, and every one of them was already making money when I bought it.\n\nI don’t come from a finance background. I wasn’t rich. I just spent time looking for small deals most people ignore.\n\nOne big reason I prefer buying instead of starting from scratch:  \nyou’re not guessing if the idea will work.\n\nThe business already exists. Customers are already paying. There’s way less uncertainty compared to starting something new where you’re testing everything from zero.\n\nIf a bought business doesn’t work out, you usually still have options - improve it, fix obvious issues, or even sell it again. That feels way less risky to me than pouring months (or years) into something that may never make a dollar.\n\nEven while writing this, I can see **dozens of small businesses with revenue** selling for just a few thousand dollars.\n\nWhat actually matters isn’t being rich or “qualified.” It’s more about finding decent deals, being willing to take action (Execution is really imp), negotiating the right price and keep on iterating once you own it, etc.\n\nThere are a lot of businesses out there where **you’d be a better operator than the current owner**.",

If you have basic sales, support, or ops skills, you can often double a tiny SaaS just by tightening those.\n\nI’d add: focus on one channel you can operate well (cold email, content, Reddit, whatever) before chasing new features. I’ve used tools like Apollo and Lemlist for that first sales push, and Pulse for Reddit to catch keywords and threads where people are already complaining about competitors or asking for alternatives.\n\nKey point: you’re buying momentum and a sandbox to learn in, not a finished product-so pick something where your specific skills can move the needle fast.",

The boring stuff matters though - clean books, contracts, entity setup (people sleep on this discoverability phase), otherwise a “cheap” deal turns expensive fast. I’ve used services like InCorp just to keep the legal/admin side boring and predictable so I could focus on ops.

That is the textbook definition of Circumventing Systems.\n\nOnce you trigger a 'Circumventing' ban, your domain name and payment profile are blacklisted forever. Google tracks digital fingerprints way beyond just your IP (browser canvas, payment hash, domain WHOIS history). A VPN will not save you.\n\nTo the OP: The 'Unverifiable Location' suspension usually happens because of a mismatch between three points:\n\n\\- Your Payment Profile (Is the credit card billing address in Wyoming or Europe?)\n\n\\- Your Website Footer (Does it list the Registered Agent address exactly?)\n\n\\- Your 'About Us' page (Does it honestly say 'US HQ with EU team'?)\n\nGoogle requires consistency. If your site looks anonymous or hides your location, their Trust Safety bot flags it.\n\nI build compliance scanners (called Merchant Risk Radar) to detect these exact 'Identity Mismatches' on storefronts. Before you appeal, make sure your website's footer address matches your Google Ads Verification documents character-for-character. Then appeal with: \"We are a US LLC with remote operations.\" Transparency fixes this, hiding via VPN makes it fatal.",

Posting in case anyone else is burning money the same way I was.\n\nBackground: bootstrapped b2b saas, tiny budget, couldn't afford SDRs. Was doing all outbound myself.\n\nBought lists from apollo, clearbit, zoominfo trials, you name it. Response rates were embarrassing. Like 1-2%. Started thinking outbound just \"doesn't work for our space.\"\n\nThen I had a dumb realization that honestly should've been obvious way sooner.\n\n**The people I want to sell to are already telling me who they are.**\n\nThey're following my competitors on linkedin.\n\nThey're commenting on posts about the exact problem I solve.\n\nThey're engaging with content in my niche every single day.\n\nWhy am I paying for some scraped list of \"CMOs in the US\" when I can just... look at who's actively interested in my space?\n\n**What I started doing:**\n\n1) Found the 5 biggest competitors in my space. Looked at their linkedin company page followers. Filtered by job title. These people literally followed a company that does what I do. They're not cold.\n\n2) Found \\~10 people who post content about my problem space. Looked at who's commenting and engaging. These people are self-identifying as caring about this topic.\n\nThen I just reached out. Super simple message like \"saw you engage with \\[x\\]'s post about \\[topic\\], working on something related, thought you might have thoughts\"\n\n**What changed:**\n\nOld way (bought lists): \\~2% reply rate, most replies were \"not interested\" or \"remove me\"\n\nNew way: 35-40% reply rate, and these people actually want to talk because they're already thinking about this stuff\n\nWent from mass outreach to like 30-40 hyper targeted messages per week. Way less volume but 10x the results.\n\n**The boring logistics part:**\n\nYou can do this manually (I did for the first few weeks, it sucked). There's some tools that scrape linkedin engagers - I've tried a few, won't shill any specific ones here but just google \"linkedin engagement scraper\" and you'll find options. Some let you automate the outreach too which saves time.\n\nMain point isn't the tools though. It's the mindset shift.\n\nStop trying to find people who MIGHT be interested.\n\nStart finding people who already ARE interested.\n\nThey're right there. Engaging with your competitors. Commenting on relevant content. Following pages in your space.",

      "text": "Started this whole thing in May 2025 because I was burnt out from my consulting gig and wanted something that could run without me being on camera every day. I'm not camera shy exactly, but the idea of filming myself three times a week while also working full time felt exhausting.\n\nThe niche I picked was personal finance for millennials. Saturated? Absolutely. But I figured the content quality bar was still pretty low for faceless channels in that space.\n\nFirst three months were rough. I was using stock footage, basic text animations, and AI voiceover. The videos looked like every other generic finance channel. Growth was basically flat at around 200 subs after posting 25 videos. CPM was decent when I finally got monetized but views were trash so it didn't matter.\n\nThe turning point came when I started thinking about the channel like a character, not just a content machine. I needed a consistent visual identity that wasn't just random stock clips of people typing on laptops.\n\nI experimented with a bunch of different approaches. Tried Midjourney for creating a recurring \"host\" character but the face consistency was all over the place. One video she'd look 25, next video she'd look 40 with completely different bone structure. Looked amateur.\n\nEnded up testing several AI portrait tools. Played around with Artflow, tried the character training on Leonardo, messed with APOB, and a few others I found on Product Hunt. Each had tradeoffs. Some were great at realism but terrible at keeping the same face across generations. Others were consistent but the output looked obviously AI.\n\nWhat finally worked was building out a proper system. I created a character bible with reference images, specific lighting preferences, and a list of expressions that matched different video topics. Took maybe two weeks of iteration but once I had that dialed in, production speed went through the roof.\n\nNow I batch create all my thumbnail and B roll images in one session. Usually takes about 3 hours to generate enough visual assets for 8 to 10 videos. Compare that to the 6+ hours I used to spend hunting for relevant stock footage that wouldn't get me a copyright strike.\n\nThe numbers since making the switch:\n\nMonth 4 to 6: Averaged 2,100 views per video\n\nMonth 7 to 8: Averaging 8,400 views per video\n\nCurrent subscriber count: 4,200\n\nRevenue last month: $847\n\nNot life changing money but the trend line is what matters. And more importantly, I'm actually enjoying the process now instead of dreading every upload.\n\nBiggest lessons from this whole experiment:\n\nConsistency in visual branding matters way more than I thought for faceless channels. Viewers subconsciously recognize your style and it builds trust even without a real human face.\n\nThe tech is good enough now that you don't need to be a designer or spend hours in Photoshop. But you do need to put in upfront work defining what you want before you start generating stuff randomly.\n\nStock footage channels are going to struggle more and more. The bar for \"professional looking\" keeps rising and audiences can tell when you're just slapping generic clips over a script.\n\nStill figuring out the best approach for scaling to a second channel in a different niche. The workflow I built is pretty transferable but picking the right topic is the hard part.",

I really don’t want fake clicks or bots that bounce immediately, so I want real website traffic. I’m hoping to find something that sends visitors who look natural, browse my website, and show up properly in analytics, since that is important for getting approved by ad networks.\n\nIt also matters to me that I can buy traffic and have an option to choose visitor locations, and that the traffic arrives gradually instead of flooding in all at once, so it keeps looking realistic. If anyone has tested a site that held up long term without causing penalties or strange ranking drops, I’d really appreciate any recommendations.",

He found this expensive vendor that guaranteed residential ips and lengthy session durations which sounded perfect on paper. We watched the real time analytics and sure enough the users were coming in from different cities and scrolling down the pages. But then we looked closer at the heatmaps and realized every single user moved their mouse in the exact same pattern before leaving. The investor pulled out after their tech team audited the logs, and my client lost the deal plus the 5k he spent on the package.",

You might see the numbers go up in your analytics for a few days and feel good about it, yet the ad networks have very sophisticated ways of spotting patterns that look unnatural. If you care about the long term health of your domain, you should probably stay away from purchasing visitors completely. It is much safer to focus on creating content that people actually search for, because once you get flagged for invalid activity, it is nearly impossible to get your reputation back with the big networks.",

      "text": "I have been running my own marketing agency for quite a few years now and have been interacting with various clients. From startups to corporations, I have done marketing for them all. And I can hardly recall using the same strategy for more than 2 clients. Each one has their own flair, their own style or a “human touch” as i like to say that makes their marketing unique. Sure there are now tools like Blobr AI, LocalQ or Ryze AI that can automate reports but to say that they can replace our work is downplaying our role, undermining our experiences. How does AI train itself? By regurgitating information that humans have already done in the past. Hypothetically, if humans were to be replaced, there would come a point where AI wouldn’t be able to offer any sort of new or beneficial suggestions. And who would come to its aid then? So, the next time anyone says that marketing is going to be majorly automated, do enlighten them :)",

      "text": "I’m an indie dev and one of my small side projects (simple calorie + habit tracking mobile app) just crossed $850 MRR. That number isn’t impressive by startup-Twitter standards, but it covers my devops costs, AI tools, and about half of my car payment. More importantly, it’s stable and still growing month over month.   \n  \nWhat surprised me most is that none of this came from TikTok hype, Instagram reels, or viral launches. No big audience. No “growth hacks.” Just a boring combination of shipping consistently, fixing UX friction, listening to user complaints, and iterating for months.  \n  \nPeople keep saying the app market is dead, SaaS is saturated, hardware is impossible, etc. From what I’m seeing, that’s mostly noise. Revenue still compounds if you keep improving something real. Whether you’re building a mobile app, a SaaS, or even a physical product: if users are getting value and you keep showing up, the curve eventually bends upward. It’s not glamorous, but it works.\n\nI’m still iterating on my app daily, and I expect it to keep growing and not because of hype, but because people actually use it.\n\n**If you’re in a slump right now: don’t stop. This is probably the best time in history to keep building.**",

They respond to relevant emails when they're actively looking for solutions to problems they're dealing with.\n\nOur clients who waste time on multi channel strategies usually perform worse than those who just nail cold email properly. Tight targeting, verified data, relevant messaging, proper infrastructure.

Reply to specific posts, add something useful, ask a real question. Cold DMs and links don’t work unless there’s already context. Reddit works if you treat it like a community, not a funnel. Answer questions, be helpful, don’t drop links. If you show up consistently, you can talk about what you’re building without getting shut down. Smaller niche communities often beat big platforms. Slack groups, Discords, forums, or founder communities where people actually talk shop.\n\nTo choose a channel, I look at where my ICP already hangs out, where I can show credibility quickly, and where I can show up every week without annoying people.\n\nI’d pick one channel, run it for two weeks, and aim for real conversations.

      "text": "I’m a founder of a SaaS company, which I built solo, bootstrapped, no investors. It helps founders grow their personal brand on X & LinkedIn and drive inbound. Simple tool, solves a real problem and makes money from day one.\n\nAnd honestly, the more I build, the more I believe micro SaaS > venture-backed startups. I’ve seen too many stories like \"raised $700K pre-seed → burned through it → now stressed out trying to raise again.\" Meanwhile, I just fix bugs, ship small features, talk to customers and grow at my own pace.\n\nWith micro SaaS, you can get to $5K–$20K MRR with high margins, no pressure and total control over your time. You don’t need a team of 20 or a slide deck for every decision. Just a useful product, a few customers who pay and a feedback loop that actually works.\n\nWould love to hear from others building solo or small- how’s it going for you? And if you’re still debating startup vs micro SaaS, happy to share more behind the scenes if helpful",

The weird thing is you stop solving user problems and start solving investor anxiety. It’s wild how much sharper your thinking gets when the only metric that matters is: do customers keep paying and telling you what to fix next?\n\nOne thing that helped me was treating my micro SaaS like a portfolio asset, not my entire identity: keep it lean, build slow moats (distribution, relationships, workflow depth), and avoid any feature that adds support burden without lifting ARPU or retention.\n\nFor finding those customers, I lean on Hypefury and Taplio for X/LinkedIn, then Pulse for Reddit in the background to catch people describing the exact pain in real time. Micro SaaS wins when your stress is capped, your calendar is light, and the scoreboard is just recurring revenue and happy users.",

However, I’ve seen this '12-hour laptop trap' **hundreds of times in my 15 years as a mentor**. You are currently in what I call the **'Circle of Busyness'**: where you mistake movement for progress.\n\nIn my book, **'Startup Inferno'**, I explain that a productive day isn't defined by how many emails you sent, but by how much you reduced the 'structural friction' of your business.\n\nHere is my advice to change your mindset:\n\n1. **Focus on 'Leverage' tasks:** Writing a blog post is fine, but did it improve your conversion rate? Sending emails is okay, but did it shorten your sales cycle? A productive day is one where you build a 'brick' that stays there forever, not just one where you 'tread water'.\n2. **Stop the 12-hour madness:** After 35 years in global strategy and startups, I can tell you: nobody is truly strategic after the 8th hour of staring at a screen. You are likely building a **'Frankenstein Startup',** adding features or content out of anxiety rather than clear vision.\n3. **The 1-Metric Rule:** Define a productive day by one single metric. For you, it might be: 'Did I talk to one fashion photographer today to understand why they haven't paid yet?' That one call is worth 10 blog posts.\n\nA productive day is when you are closer to a scalable system, not just when you are tired. How many of those 12 hours are spent actually talking to potential users vs. just 'polishing' your tool?",

If YOU have to ask then I think it suggests it is not possible for you. But Richard Branson never asked anyone whether it was possible. And if I had to guess he never knew if it would work or not, he was having fun and trying to make some money along the way.\n\nI listened to a few of Branson’s masterclass videos and read a biography years ago. The guy just has brass balls he developed from his youth. I remember a story of his mom dropping he and his brother off in the middle of road and making them find their way home. Stuff young adults today would say was “abuse”, but his mom was trying to teach them to be resourceful and solve problems on their own. Branson told a story of how he founded the airline. He was stuck in an airport and his flight kept getting delayed so he just walks into a hangar and talks to some people with planes. Charters one, writes on a paper board “Flights for $99 to wherever the f” he was going, and sold the rest of the empty seats. That was the genesis for the airline idea. \n\nYou look some random ass facts like “he only had this much money” blah blah and you think that is a linchpin to whether he was successful or a failure? He is successful because he tried bold ideas, he solves problems, he doesn’t ask for permission, etc. His mindset is not one to ask Reddit if it will work, he acts on his ideas and sees them through to fruition, and some worked and some didn’t.",

He may have leased a used 747 for a lot less, but he used the cashflow and reputation of the existing Virgin businesses to guarantee the airline and get away with starting the airline itself on comparatively little capital whilst assuring it would't fold whilst he fought for routes (as Freddie Laker found out the hard way).\n\nEarly cashflow came from forward ticket sales. I can remember a tale of Branson writing a cheque to fill the 747 with fuel and wincing.\n\nAnd Virgin Music was launched on an inheritance of around £3k from an aunt and £300 from his mother in 1970s money, plus a bank loan guaranteed by family money of £25k. Modern cash equivalents probably approaching £200k in total.\n\nIt cost him £2500 to cover the studio costs for Tubular Bells...and the net profits on the sales of that were around £5m-£7m in 70's money.\n\nSO: Sure everyone really starts from 'just an idea', but these founder myths aren't helpful.\n\nBranson bootsrapped a smaller business first that was financed, and used that to underpin a bigger business.  You gotta either bring growth capital, or underwritten financing with you pretty quickly if you want to start to make noises in a sector.\n\nNone of this to say that championing Tubular Bells and making a pile out of it, or seeing where Freddie Laker went wrong weren't genius business moves...they definitely were...it's just that he came from an upper middle class background despite the hippy veneer, and was positioned to make it happen.\n\nSome version of that is the lesson for doing the same today.",

Having spent **35 years** navigating both global multinationals and the startup world, and **15 years mentoring hundreds of founders**, I’ve seen this 'Branson myth' lead many people straight into what I call the **'Circle of Heresy',** denying current market reality.\n\nIs it still possible? **Yes, but the rules have changed.**\n\n1. **From 'Flashy Marketing' to 'Structural Trust':** In the 80s, you could launch an airline with a bold move and a phone call. Today, transparency is 10x higher. You can't just 'convince' partners; you need to demonstrate a system that works. In my book **'Startup Inferno'**, I call this avoiding the **'Frankenstein Startup',** don't just stitch together promises; build a solid core.\n2. **The 'Pre-payment' Reality:** Using customer money to scale (bootstrapping) is still the ultimate gold standard. But today, customers are more cynical. You need a 'Minimum Viable Trust' before they hand over their cash.\n3. **The Leverage of 2026:** Branson didn't have AI or global digital reach. Today, you don't need millions to start, but you need **extreme focus**. The danger now isn't 'not having resources', it's 'wasting resources' on 100 different paths.\n\nSuccess today isn't about being a billionaire first; it's about being the most **resilient architect** of your own vision. Most people fail not because they lack Branson's money, but because they lack his ability to simplify complex chaos into a single, executable mission.",

Bought a \"clean\" list, loaded it into a sequence, hit send, and waited for replies like an idiot. Opens were mid, replies were dead, and bounces kept creeping up. I kept blaming subject lines and rewriting my pitch, but the real problem was I was emailing the wrong people. Wrong roles, wrong industries, old contacts, random info that made personalization impossible. I was basically doing spam with extra steps.\n\nHere’s what I changed and it finally started working. I stopped chasing big lists and started building small, tight segments. One niche, one city, one exact buyer type. I do quick spot checks on the company site so I know they are actually my ICP, then I validate emails before anything goes into a sequence. First email stays plain text with no links and one simple question. I send 100 to 200 at a time, see what gets replies, then double down on that exact segment.\n\nMost \"cold email problems\" are not copy problems. They are list problems.

Hang out where they already are (FB groups, local forums, WhatsApp groups, etc.).\n* Offer 1:1 “I’ll walk you through your next property decision for free if you let me watch you use the tool.” You learn a lot and a few of them will stick.\n* Make one super clear promise on the landing page, in their words, like: “In 5 minutes see the 3 biggest risks of this house/area.” Right now most of us talk too much about “AI” and not enough about the outcome.\n* Pick *one* channel for now (eg. a single subreddit, one FB group, one city) and go deep instead of posting a little bit everywhere.\n\nAlso learn SEO and PPC",

People largely don't use platforms just because the one they already use is inconvenient in several ways. People only switch if the other platform has unique enough features that solve *their* problem and that's where most get lost. That's where the testing comes in.\n\nDon't build just another site that can do what Zillow either already does or could easily do. This is why their competitors don't focus on Zillow's biggest strength, data gathering.\n\nI've found that a lot of aspiring entrepreneurs have the mindset of companies being the products they sell and its completely wrong. The ones that don't get traction and don't find longevity tend to not look at companies as extensions of people, themselves included and that's also completely wrong. Companies are literally just people who build and sell things. As a person, you should be building and selling based on your greatest strengths, not only based on what solved your own personal problems. That means identifying what you believe you can do better than anyone else. If you are a savant at data gathering and analysis, then maybe trying to challenge Zillow at what they do best could maybe work, but even then, it's risky. Instead, find an area where you know you are or can become the best, see if you can make viable solutions out of those skills, see if that lines up with any of Zillow's weaknesses, and then if it does, build from there.\n\nA problem with building only based on what you like and what solves your problems is that you can build the coolest whiz bang thing that people actually use and you can build a little value, but then you look at the adults, Zillow, Redfin, Realtor etc and you find that they don't really need what you've been selling, and that would drastically lower market value of what you built to them if you ever wanted to sell.",

              "text": "Hey, really appreciate you taking the time to write this.\n\nYou’re actually right about one thing: trying to replace Zillow would be a terrible idea. That’s not what I’m building. SmartHood isn’t a marketplace or listing site. It’s more like a decision layer on top of sites like Zillow or Funda. People already browse listings there.  \n\n\nThe problem I kept seeing (and experienced myself) was everything around the listing:\n\nIs the price fair for this area?\n\nAny hidden risks?\n\nWhat should I check before making an offer?\n\nHow does this compare to other homes I saw last week?\n\nMost of that info exists, but it’s scattered across 10 tabs and a lot of guesswork.\n\nSo the tool just sits on top of the listing page and helps you understand and compare homes faster, especially when you’re looking at many properties at once. Not trying to compete with Zillow’s data engine.  \nMore like helping buyers make sense of what they’re already seeing there.\n\nSo feedback like yours is genuinely helpful.",

Start by hand-holding 5–10 people through an actual decision, then back into the product.\n\nFor SmartHood I’d go hyper-specific: “Helping expats in NL decide between 2–3 properties this month.” Then:\n\n1) Hang out where they complain: expat FB groups, r/Netherlands, housing Discords. Reply to posts with something like: “I built a tool that compares neighborhoods. If you want, I’ll walk you through 2 options and send you a summary.” No signup link, just DM.\n\n2) Do 30–45 min calls where you literally screen-share SmartHood, ask what they care about (schools, commute, noise, safety), and customize the view. Charge a tiny fee once you’ve done a few for free.\n\n3) Turn their exact words and screenshots into your landing copy and example pages.\n\nI’ve used GummySearch, Reddit search, and then Pulse to catch keywords like “moving to Amsterdam” without living online all day.\n\nMain point: treat it like a hands-on decision assistant for a tiny niche first, then worry about scaling the SaaS.",
