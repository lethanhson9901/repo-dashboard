      "text": "I see hundreds of post each week with people asking for the magic pill to become successful. I would sell this info for $99 but no one would buy it because there is really no secret to it.\n\n1.\t⁠Worked 14 years (steady 9-5 w2 job)without a vacation or a off day. Literally missed 6 hours of work the day my son was born and another day when I had the swine flu. Saved money\n\n2.\t⁠Picked a industry that created the most millionaires and spent every waking second learning as much as I could about the industry and all the different niches and verticals. (Real estate)\n\n3.\t⁠Found the most successful people in my area and emailed them asking how I could provide value to them in exchange for learning and eventually having opportunities to be apart of deals.\n\n4.\t⁠Obtained a real estate license and agreed to write offers for a group of investors, I would receive $750 at closing and credit the rest of my commission to the investors. Wrote thousands of offers and pocketed over $100k cash, credited close to a million to the investors.\n\n5.\t⁠Learned what the investors looked for, who they used for lending and contractors. Started to buy my own properties and do joint ventures with the investors group.\n\n6.\t⁠Found contractors in the service industry who were great operators but terrible at business. Bought into their companies and assembled a team to handle the backend. (Hvac, roofing, roll off dumpsters).\n\n7.\t⁠Built a portfolio of 19 rental houses that I paid on average $125k for. When the market spiked I sold 14 of the properties for a average of $310k per unit.\n\n8.\t⁠Paid off the 5 rental properties and that cash flow pays my living expenses. Dumped the rest of the money into a self strorage deal, and short term rentals. At the age of 38 my net worth was north of 4 million and my monthly cash flow from all properties and businesses is over $20k a month with some months hitting $60k. It took 20 years and a lot of 80 work weeks to build “passive income”. Looking back I regret not spending time with my kids and family. Having money is nice but relationships, family, health, and memories is a lot better. The more you make the more you spend. My life and problems are still similar to when I was paycheck to paycheck, I just have nicer cars, house, and am able to do whatever I want whenever I want. Which gets boring quicker than you would think. The market has changed so much I no longer invest in real estate, have seen a lot of people over leverage and lose it all. Hope this rant helps someone. Key point to take away is just find something and go all in, but also live your life and cherish your family, friends, health",

For the first ~14 years I was still working 9–5 and doing real estate at nights and weekends. The only part that really felt “all in” was the later stage when I already had some capital, experience, and a network.\n\t2.\tI didn’t quit and go unpaid. I was extremely conservative early on. I saved aggressively from my job, lived way below my means, and used that as my runway. Real estate was something I layered on top, not something I jumped into blind. Time was the bigger constraint than money — it meant a lot of late nights, weekends, and saying no to almost everything else.\n\t3.\tEverything overlapped. Learning never stopped. Writing offers, networking, finding contractors, investing, buying into businesses — it all happened in parallel once momentum started. The “steps” only look neat in hindsight. In reality it was messy, lots of trial and error, and plenty of dead ends.\n\nBiggest thing I’d stress: there was no master plan. Just consistent effort over a long time, and being willing to look stupid, work more than everyone else, and stick around long enough for compounding to kick in.",

Its the idea of build a business on the side and commit when its sufficient, don't be discouraged by your lack of capital (this was my issue).\n\nAlso like you referenced at the end - you will look stupid and progress is not linear, but it compounds over time. And the tricky part of compounding is that it doesnt look like much for quite a while, but then it \"suddenly\" takes off.\n\nTo your credit, though, what you did was a really smart way to make your own opportunity, even if that master plan didnt exist. Its a fine line between small failures and looking stupid while making progress on the long-term vs building something that sounds interesting but nobody wants, and wasting time and effort on it for much longer than it deserves.",

Last year, two years removed from any job (at 70), I went all in and started building my own AI SaaS company.\n\nWe launch it next month (SonicVox.ai), and we’ll be the first AI Ecosystem in the world, complete with speech, translation, workflow agents, conversational agents, text to thumbnail/images, text to video, and more.\n\nI was rather surprised to see angel investors not interested in prelaunch investment, when our overall stack is bigger than ElevenLabs (latest valuation $11B). But, I am actually a bit relieved, because our valuation just after launch will be much larger. I’m betting investors will be breaking our door down. 😂.\n\nWhy? Because we beat everyone else to a fully defensive AI ecosystem that no other company has or can copy with 3 years…not ElevenLabs, not Meta, not Google, and not Meta.\n\nMy prediction: We reach $3B valuation by 2030…within 4 years.",

Instead of looking for a hack, I spent a full week doing the most boring, unscalable work possible: manual directory submissions.\n\nHere is exactly what that grind looked like:  \n\\->  I vetted 50 high-DR (Domain Rating) directories where the links were mostly dofollow.   \n\\->  I didn't use any automation tools.   \n\\->  I manually submitted to 5-10 sites per day over a week so it looked natural to Google's crawlers.   \n\\->  I wrote unique descriptions for every single submission so it didn't look like a copy-paste job.  \n\\-> It took me 30+ hours of tedious research and data entry.\n\n**The Results**  \nAbout three weeks after I finished the grind, the needle finally started moving.\n\nActive Users - 10k   \nTotal Views - 19k  \nSearch Impressions - 2.84k  \nDomain Rating Jump - 0 to 21 gradually  \n  \n**The Business Lesson I learnt is:**  \nMost founders spend all their time trying to find an AI tool to automate their growth, but sometimes the best move is to just sit down and do the manual work that doesn't scale. Building that initial trust with Google gave me a foundation that actually stays alive even when I’m not active on social media.  \n  \nIf you're stuck at zero, stop looking for a shortcut and start building your foundation.\n\nI’m happy to answer any questions about the specific directories or the slow-drip strategy if you're struggling with indexing!",

This is the perfect example of what I call the **'Dashboard Delusion.'** In my **35 years in business and 15 years mentoring hundreds of founders**, I’ve seen many 'miracles' that were just well-edited videos.\n\nIn my book, **'Startup Inferno'**, this is the core of the **Circle of Lust**: falling in love with the *image* of success rather than the *mechanics* of it. When someone admits they 'simulate dashboards' for marketing, they are admitting their product isn't dropshipping, it's selling an illusion to the desperate.\n\nUsing my **Curling analogy**: these gurus are trying to convince you the stone is in the center of the house by painting a target around where it landed. But real business is about the **'Sweeping',** the hard, unglamorous work of removing friction from operations, logistics, and margins.\n\nReal entrepreneurs don't show off 'simulated' dashboards; they obsess over **Operational Validation**. They know that if the structure underneath is fake, the 'success' will collapse the moment a real market breeze hits it.\n\n**Question for you:** Now that you’ve seen behind the curtain, what’s the one 'boring' metric you look for now to tell if a founder is actually the real deal?",

Stress does not switch off at the door. A supportive partner acts as a stabilizer, helping him decompress, regain perspective, and avoid burning out. Not by nagging about his behavior that she doesn't like. That support is often invisible but extremely valuable. That's why a lot of partners don't know hour to support the other partner. \n\nThe dynamic works best when both people reduce stress rather than add to it. Constant pressure on either side compounds quickly. If he never sets work down and she only voices frustration, both people end up trapped in a stress loop that eventually damages the relationship.\n\nHealthy couples tend to operate as a team. Instead of framing problems as who is causing what, they focus on how to make things easier for each other. Support is not just emotional reassurance. It includes understanding, perspective, patience, and sometimes practical action.\n\nCompatibility matters. The most effective partnerships are not perfect but mutually reinforcing. Each person contributes in ways that genuinely help the other stay balanced and effective.\n\nIt is not him versus her. When the relationship becomes adversarial, both lose. When it becomes cooperative, both benefit.",

      "text": "hello everyone, the whole story is in the headline. I'm building **Oiti, the world's first ai clone for B2B content on LinkedIn**. Before this I've failed 3x, this one's taking off and has made $5K so far and reached 1000 users. \n\nsharing how I'm using LinkedIn to grow my B2B saas that helps people, well, grow on LinkedIn:\n\n1. linkedin lead magnets get insane reach but only 10-20% of those leads are qualified. the rest collect PDFs like pokemon cards. use Apify + n8n / Triggify to scrape and qualify that list before you treat it as anything.\n2. cold DMs are dying. linkedin restricts you to 20-25 connection requests a day even on sales navigator. warm outbound is the play. scrape your likers and commenters weekly, qualify them, reach out. 50-70% reply rate because they already know you.\n3. scrape competitor engagement by searching \"your keyword\" + \"i'll send it over\" on linkedin search. these are people actively promising to share resources with prospects. scrape them and reach out. 25-50%+ reply rates. then nurture with your content and reach out again once they engage.\n4. get 3-5 people with similar audiences to engage with your post in the first 10 minutes. employee accounts, friend accounts, whatever. 30-50% bump in reach. every major brand does this, they just don't talk about it.\n5. stop using chrome extensions for scheduling. i've had multiple clients get banned using tools like Taplio. linkedin detects them and flags your account. only use tools that connect through linkedin's official APIs (very hard to get access). Oiti (my product) is what i use for my own content and client accounts -- it has a magic link so agencies can connect accounts safely without chrome extensions, etc.\n6. mix 4 types weekly: lead magnet for reach, hot take for positioning, deep tactical post for serious buyers, lead magnet post for conversions. if all your posts get tons of likes you're writing for people who will never buy.\n7. avoid sob stories that are cringe stories for sophisticated B2B audiences. they attract tire kickers. exception: wrap the story inside a listicle that leans into your product.\n8. the linkedin algorithm is two things: dwell time (how long people read after \"see more\") and early engagement velocity (first 10-15 minutes). that's it. most \"studies\" on the algorithm are trash and fake news to sell courses.\n9. ai content works: the fix isn't better prompts -- it's dynamic memory. a system that learns what you like, what you hate, and adapts permanently. that's why i built Oiti -- tell it \"stop using the word leverage\" and it never makes that mistake again.\n10. wake up every morning and check linkedin news. if you write a post around a trending news story (bitcoin drops to 70k, major layoffs, whatever), linkedin features it in the posts associated with that news which will lead to massive spike in reach for that day.\n11. copy trends. look at what drove a ton of traction in a big category like \"ai\" and adapt it for your niche: for example, \"ai clone for b2b linkedin content\" is my niche.\n12. write a cringe post on linkedin on purpose, then share it on r /LinkedInLunatics from a burner account. a lot of people will trash you but if you wrote it intelligently for your ICP, you'll get a ton of profile visits and leads from the drama.\n13. selfies are cringe but picture + post gets around 70% more feed space on mobile vs just text.\n14. write for mobile first – most of your audience is scrolling on their phone.\n15. a vast majority of linkedin influencers are using pods. not lempod etc but private whatsapp groups of people who bought their course. copying their content strategy will NOT work for your small account because you don't have 50 people liking your post in the first 5 minutes.\n16. collect viral outliers instead. find accounts between 3K-20K followers that have outlier hits (100-200% bump in engagement vs their normal posts). adapt those for your niche – Oiti helps me find and track these.\n17. 30 relevant likes from B2B buyers are worth more than 100K views from random people. optimize for the right 30 people, not the biggest number.\n\nGood luck and happy building!\n\n– Aitijya from ghostwriting-ai.com\n\n",

      "text": "I recently introduced a new line of automobiles into my business after fulfilling a contract that required bulk sourcing. It was one of those moments where everything seemed routine, until it wasn’t.\n\nYou know that feeling when you’re recharging airtime from your bank app and you accidentally add one extra zero, or when you give someone change and only realize later that you were too generous? That was exactly how this started. Somewhere between checking quantities and confirming payment, I placed an order for 4 wheel motorbikes on Alibaba that was far more than I intended.\n\nIn my head, I was ordering 50. In reality, I ordered 500.\n\nBy the time it clicked, the order was already in motion. To soften the blow, my client agreed to take more units than originally planned, which helped. Still, I was left with a significant number of 4 wheel motorbikes sitting comfortably in inventory, waiting for purpose.\n\nInstead of stressing, I decided to absorb it into the business. Slowly, units moved. Bulk buyers came through. Numbers reduced. Today, I’m down to 50. Ironically, the exact number I intended to order in the first place.\n\nFor now, I’m exploring partnerships with organizations that might need bulk purchases before considering single-unit sales. It’s funny how one small mistake can quietly expand your business in ways you never planned.",

      "text": "Two months ago I left my job as a frontend developer to build SaaS products full time. I had about €16K saved up. I'm down to €10K now and some days the math keeps me up at night.\n\nI'm not writing this as a success story. I'm writing this because every post I see here is either \"I made $50K MRR in 3 months\" or \"don't give up, keep grinding.\" Nobody talks about what it actualy feels like in the messy middle. So heres the honest version.\n\n\n\n**The situation**\n\nI started with a first SaaS two months ago. Built it, launched it, started seeing some traction through SEO. Not life changing numbers but enough to keep me going. I decided to put it on near autopilot and let organic growth do its thing while I started building a second product like a week ago.\n\nThe logic makes sense on paper: diversify, let SEO compound, build while I still have runway.\n\nThe reality feels very different.\n\n\n\n**What nobody tells you about living on savings**\n\nSome days are genuinely good. I wake up, check my analytics, see growth, feel like I made the right call. I build features, write content, talk to users. I feel alive in a way I never did at a desk job.\n\nThen there are the other days.\n\nThe days where I open my bank account and do the mental math. €10K. Maybe 4 months of bare minimum living. I start thinking about what happens if this doesnt work. I think about going back to applying for frontend jobs, which brings its own anxiety.\n\nHeres the thing nobody talks about: I've been a frontend dev for 6 years. I can build full apps from scratch. But I studied mechanical engineering, learned to code through a bootcamp (Le Wagon), and built my skills by actualy shipping products, not by grinding LeetCode. So when companies send me technical tests, I bomb them. I can build your entire product but I cant reverse a binary tree on a whiteboard.\n\nThat gap between what I can do and what I can prove in a 45 minute coding test is terrifying when its your plan B.\n\n\n\n**What keeps me going**\n\nI have this goal that I come back to when things get dark. I want to live in Sydney. The sun, the ocean, the lifestyle. Every time I think about quitting I picture myself there and I remember why I'm doing this.\n\nIt sounds stupid when I write it down. But having a clear picture of what your building toward, not just \"financial freedom\" or \"be my own boss\" but something specific and vivid, thats the thing that gets me out of bed on the bad days.\n\nThe traction helps too. Its small but its real. And real traction, even tiny, is proof that the idea works. The question is just wether it'll grow fast enough before the savings run out.\n\n\n\n**Where I'm at mentally**\n\nI'm not gonna pretend I have this figured out. Most days I go back and forth between \"this is the best decision I ever made\" and \"I'm an idiot burning through savings on a dream.\" Sometimes both in the same hour.\n\nToday is one of those days where I just want to disappear and quit everything honestly. Ask me again tomorow and I'll probably feel better. Thats kind of how it goes.",

          "text": "The main thing here is you already did the rarest part: you stuck around through the silence instead of rage-quitting or sprinting back to a paycheck at the first wobble.\n\nWhat you’re feeling is exactly what happens when your runway and identity are tied together. Two ideas that helped me:\n\n1) Put hard guardrails on the money. Decide now: “If MRR isn’t at X or trending up by Month Y, I freelance 2–3 days/week.” That turns the fear into a trigger for a plan instead of a fog.\n\n2) Stop treating product #1 as “on autopilot.” Pick one growth motion (SEO, cold outreach, or partnerships) and commit to a small weekly quota: number of articles, DMs, or emails. Momentum compounds way faster than splitting your brain across two half-marketed products.\n\nOn the job front, you can dodge a lot of LeetCode hell by aiming at smaller startups, networking into teams, and showing real projects instead of tests. I’ve landed work that way using my own apps as the portfolio, plus things like Upwork and cold DMs; tools like Ahrefs, Indie Hackers, and Pulse for Reddit help me find where my exact users and potential employers hang out.\n\nMain point: give your fear a job with clear rules, focus on one growth engine, and keep a realistic “back to cashflow” plan so Sydney stays a goal, not an escape fantasy.",

It's revenue, not recurring.  \nOn top of that, if your actual livelihood depends on this target, it's even harder because as the days go by you start questioning every choice and you start making panic-based choices.

      "text": "&#x200B;\n\nWhen I first started my entrepreneurial journey, I genuinely thought the hardest part would be execution.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe hardest part was finding the right idea.\n\nBefore this, I failed. Not once. Not twice. Five different ventures. Some died quickly, some dragged on longer than they should have, but all of them had one thing in common. I was building things I thought sounded interesting, not things people were actively struggling with.\n\nToday, our tech startup earned its first dollar.\n\nIt is a small amount. Almost symbolic. But if you have been through failure, you know how big that moment feels. That dollar carries more validation than months of motivation.\n\nWhat changed this time was not my work ethic or discipline. It was how I approached the idea itself.\n\nIn the early days of entrepreneurship, choosing the wrong idea is brutally expensive. Not in money, but in time, energy, and belief. You can work hard on the wrong problem and still end up nowhere. That lesson took me years to learn.\n\nThis time, I focused on something very unglamorous. A problem people were already complaining about. Something boring enough that no one was pitching it with buzzwords. Something that existed whether or not I built a startup around it.\n\nI actually came across the idea while searching on Google and stumbling onto StartupIdeasDB. I do not even know if I am allowed to share links here, so I will avoid that. But what stood out to me was not how exciting the ideas sounded. It was how practical they were. Many of them were rooted in real frustrations people already talk about online.\n\nThat flipped a switch for me.\n\nInstead of asking “Is this idea innovative?”, I started asking “Are people already annoyed enough to pay for a solution?”\n\nSolving problems people complain about openly is far more powerful than chasing ideas that sound impressive in founder circles. Fancy ideas get applause. Boring ideas get revenue. This holds true whether you are building B2B or B2C.\n\nLooking back, my failed ventures were not failures of effort. They were failures of judgment. I was trying to invent demand instead of listening to it.\n\nThis experience taught me something I wish I had understood earlier. Your job as an early stage founder is not to sound smart. It is to reduce pain. Quietly. Consistently. In a way people are already asking for.\n\nToday’s first dollar did not come from brilliance. It came from humility. From accepting that the best ideas are often already hiding in plain sight, inside problems people complain about every single day.\n\nIf you are early in your journey, learn this sooner than I did. The right idea will save you years.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI built HiFi.fan — an independent audio news and product platform. After 2+ years of solo development, I'm putting it up for sale. Wanted to share the honest numbers and lessons.\n\n**The numbers:**\n- 57,000 active users (2025)\n- 87,000 annual page views\n- 375% year-over-year growth\n- 3,500+ returning visitors\n- $0 revenue (never monetized)\n\n**What it is:**\nA Next.js platform that aggregates audio industry news, product listings, and specs. Think \"what's happening in hi-fi\" in one place. Built with a custom data pipeline that auto-collects content.\n\n**Tech stack:** Next.js, React, Node.js, automated data collection pipeline\n\n**What went right:**\n- Found a real niche — audiophiles actively searching for gear info\n- Growth was organic, no paid marketing\n- Built solid tech infrastructure\n\n**What went wrong:**\n- Never prioritized monetization (classic developer trap)\n- Spent too much time on features, not enough on business model\n- Running it solo meant no accountability on the revenue side\n- Life priorities shifted — can't give it the time it deserves\n\n**Lessons for this community:**\n1. Build monetization into v1, not \"someday\"\n2. 57K users means nothing if you can't convert them\n3. A solo project needs revenue milestones, not just feature milestones\n4. Know when to pass the torch — someone with ad sales experience could monetize this quickly\n\n**Why I'm selling:**\nI simply don't have the time anymore. The platform works, the audience is there, but it needs someone who can focus on the business side. Hosting is ~$100/month self-hosted.\n\n**What's included:**\nFull codebase, domain (hifi.fan), all content, data pipeline, user base, documentation.\n\nIf you're interested or have questions, DM me or email cajoy@hifi.fan.\n\nHappy to share more details with serious inquiries.",

When you’re deep in building, monetization always feels like “I’ll do it once it’s bigger.”\n\nOut of curiosity — did users ever ask for anything that hinted at willingness to pay? Like comparison tools, price alerts, saved setups, etc.?\n\nAlso, if you’re selling it, 57k active users + 375% YoY growth is not small.

The \"build audience first, monetize later\" trap catches so many of us.\n\nI did the same thing with my first product—focused entirely on user growth because it felt productive and validating. 6 months in, I had thousands of visitors but no revenue model that actually worked. The mental shift from \"how do I get more users?\" to \"how do I make money from users?\" is harder than it sounds.\n\nYour lesson about \"revenue milestones, not feature milestones\" hits hard. I had feature checklists. I had user growth charts. What I didn't have was a spreadsheet that said \"by month 3, we need $500 MRR or we change something fundamental.\"\n\nThe brutal truth: users don't automatically convert to revenue just because you have lots of them. 57K audiophiles is an incredible niche audience—affluent, passionate, always buying gear. The fact that it generated $0 isn't a product failure, it's a business model failure. And those are much easier to fix when you catch them early.\n\nFor anyone reading this: if you can't answer \"how will this make money in the first 90 days?\" before you write your first line of code, you're not building a business yet. You're building a project. Both are fine, but know which one you're doing.\n\nGood luck with the sale. The tech and audience you've built is genuinely valuable—just needs someone with a different skillset than pure product development.",

      "text": "So still most people in Kenya still rely on mobile data bundles for internet access and in all honesty Safaricom (and \"friends\") absolutely milk that system. Bundles expire, speeds drop, and you’re paying more for less. Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is cheaper, more convenient, and way more scalable… if you can get it close to people.\n\nI live in a fairly remote area, but I’m close to a market that’s still developing. One day a friend visited me and casually suggested I try running a Wi-Fi hotspot around there. At first, I didn’t take it seriously. I assumed everyone would just use Safaricom bundles for those unable  to buy wifi installation services,so I didn’t see why anyone would pay for local Wi-Fi.\n\nAfter thinking about it for a while, I decided to try anyway purely as an experiment.\n\nI didn’t start big or spend much. I used a second-hand MikroTik router my friend sold me, added a basic Tenda router, and connected everything to my existing Airtel 5G  smart box, which I already pay for monthly. We ran a long Ethernet cable outside, mounted the equipment in a small box, and pointed the antennas toward the market. That was the entire setup.\n\nOn the first day, from around 10am to midnight, I made about 1,200 KES. I assumed it was just people being curious and trying something new. But the same thing happened the next day, and the day after that. On slower days I make around 1,500 KES, and on good days it goes up to about 2,000 KES.Crazy!!\n\nWithin about a week, I had recovered all my initial costs. That’s when it stopped feeling like a small side experiment and started feeling like a real opportunity.\n\nLater, a friend showed me his own dashboard. He averages around 15,000 KES per day. He also mentioned others who earn much more, but those setups are larger fiber connections, multiple locations, and years of gradual expansion. That’s when I realized this business doesn’t grow overnight. It grows with infrastructure, patience, and consistency.\n\nThe hardest part for me wasn’t the money or the hardware. It was learning how to configure MikroTik properly and setting up the billing system. Without guidance, I'd probably would have quit early out of frustration. Once everything was configured correctly, though, the system became fairly stable and mostly runs itself.\n\nI’m not posting this to sell anything or claim I’ve figured everything out. I just wanted to share an honest experience for anyone who’s curious . You can start small, learn as you go, and grow slowly while doing things properly over time.\n\nEstimated capital (based on my setup)\n\nMikroTik router  5,000 KES\n\nTenda router 1,500 KES\n\nBilling system (iterativebilling.com)  1,000 KES\n\nAirtel 5G internet 3,000 KES\n\nElectricity 1,500 KES per month\n\nTotal: 12,000 KES\n\nThis could definitely grow into something bigger, but it would require an big investors for better equipment, stronger infrastructure, and proper licensing. I’m still researching the regulatory side and long term setup. With the right investment and planning, this could be a solid business, especially in underserved areas.\n\n(I decided to post this here again in case a potential investor missed it the first time. During the previous post, there was a lot of curiosity and I genuinely enjoyed answering questions and engaging with everyone. However, I did not secure an investor who could provide solid backing.\n\nI am sharing it again with the hope of connecting with someone interested in supporting the project.)\n\nEdit: you see my current plan is to scale carefully from a single source point: start with 8–10 high-quality access points for local coverage, then use high-performance PowerBeam M5s and NanoStations for backhaul. That way I can push wifi signals over several kilometers, effectively linking the underserved spots without those massive infrastructure investments. The idea is to gradually expand, fund each step from the revenue, and build a stable, scalable network.\nIt’s a small start, but I think targeting those underserved gaps strategically is exactly how a small ISP like this can grow without directly competing with the big players.\n\nScenario;When I get at least 1000 users everyday,  with each paying as low 40kes everyday , that is 40,000 kes a day and 1,200,000 kes monthly revenue.Thats huge.\n\nAs always, feel free to ask any questions if you find it interesting. \n\nHappy Valentines day to y'all.\n\n......\n\n(Edit) Update 16/2/2026: I haven’t secured an investor for the expansion yet, but I’m continuing to refine the plan and explore ways to roll it out efficiently.",

I’ve read the project goals and how they intend to expand digital access, but in reality they’re mostly focused on public institutions and large contracts tied to big infrastructure builds, not small private MSMEs like a local ISP startup yet, which makes it very hard for someone like me to benefit directly.I'm  trying to set up/scale slowly in underserved, semi developing area that I currently living in.\n\nAlso, Kenyan grant programs in general tend to be very competitive and bureaucratic  as I said  you often need connections or capacity in grant writing just to stand even a small chance, and I’ve seen people on other programs basically give up because the process is so slow and opaque, it kind of hopeless reallying on them.I kind stand better chances posting here\n\nSo yeah, I appreciate the suggestions, but right now the challenge isn’t that I haven’t heard of these options it’s that accessing them as a small business \"founder\" still feels like an uphill battle without links into those networks.",

Here’s how it actually works: when a user connects to the wifi , they are redirected to a portal page showing different packages with set time limits. Once they purchase a package let's say, 50kes the system automatically grants access for that duration. When the time runs out, access is cut off automatically. The system handles everything behind the scenes, including preventing sharing( I can work around this by registering Mac address for othere extra devices like in a family setting though), limiting simultaneous connections, and tracking usage. So each user’s session is controlled and managed automatically no passwords needed.",

Not surveys, actual intent signals. If presell doesn't work but waitlist does, you've got data on what to build. If neither works, you've got information that saves you months.\n\nWeek 4 is the pivot point. By now you know if you're chasing something people want or just something interesting to you. The tactical difference now is whether you go deep on one paying customer or iterate based on waitlist data. Both paths are valid but they're very different businesses.\n\n",

I've managed companies. I've managed large sales teams.I've been an employee... Nope.\n\nIs it more difficult the way that I choose to do business?? Absolute at times. Yesterday was a good case in point.\n\nI had a few million dollars worth of inventory land at my warehouse. I unloaded it with a forklift, then I broke open all the wooden crates and unloaded everything (thousands of 45#-65# boxes) into sorted piles by part number on the ground and then took inventory. Then, I rearranged and stocked the entire warehouse. So the new inventory would go in the back, and the old stuff would be in the front. I've replaced labels on all the boxes and made it the way I like it. I picked thirty seven back.Order orders from new customers because I picked all first orders. A package them and shipped them. Then, I cleaned up the warehouse and went home at midnight. Woke up at five a m. Went to my warehouse and loaded up deliveries to a handful of local customers ive had since the beginning and hand delivered all of their orders. It was about a 6 hour trip. While driving, I took new orders from new customers. I received payments. \n\nI got back to my shop and I had six new customer orders, so I onboarded them and picked packed and shipped their orders. Sent their invoices and tracking number and then received their payments and sent out receipts. Update my sales board for the day and my numbers for the week and then month.\n\nNow my day starts. All that other stuff was just because of the inventory arriving yesterday. Moments like these only happen a couple times a year. When they happen though it's a burn, the boat's moment you work until you're done. This is why I get paid the big bucks. \n\nI could have hired someday labor. I could have shipped the orders instead of delivering them. I can automate even first orders through my 3PL including the onboarding process and payment process. \n\nThis was my vision of how my company would run, and it works well. I like the hectic crazy times a few times a year. It reminds me of all the beginning years when it was every day.\n\nSo, yes, you can build a business as big as you want. We should break nine figures this year.And that's nine figures, top line and bottom line. Without another soul employed. You'll have to put systems in place. You'll have to be the most proficient person in every role necessary at all times, with skill sets and experience to backet. \n\nI love business. It's the only life or death game left for us humans.",

I tried to have a guy that worked me in the warehouse in year four, but I realized I don't want to run a daycare. \n\nI do keep a warehouse at our home base here in texas. Some of its economics.It's a lot more affordable to feed the three p.L facilities pallets as needed instead of paying for storage space. I bought the warehouse for less than a hundred grand on a tax foreclosure auction. We only used one bay, the middle bay is our library and our outdoor camping gear storage, and the third bay is an apartment with everything that a home would have, and then there's the hallway and the bathroom.\n\nI do all the roles.So sales is one of the primary roles.I handle day to day. I take all first orders and I pick pack and ship them.And then I onboard them into our system, when I send the invoice and tracking on that first order.\n\nI broke my personal record this last week with thirteen thousand dollars in one day in new orders. \n\nIt doesn't matter if I do fifty dollars or thirteen thousand dollars in one day.Because our residuals range between $150k-$250k a day. We did break three hundred thousand dollars for the first time in 10 years in one day, this week. The primary reason for it was due to back order that head built up over the last few months. I don't think we'll hit three hundred thousand in a day again.Until end of year or next year.\n\nSo yes, when we were doing seven million dollars, that was where I broke, and I chose the three p l system. I was picking and packing orders fifteen hours a day.Seven days a week and doing no sales, no payment management.No, inventory management, much less managing our oem scheduled release purchase orders factory to factory, for our  the truck and bus manufacturers, which takes time and creativity managing and scrubbing bills of lading from 8 countries.\n\nThis may be our first 9 figure year. I'm optimistic, but not overly confident.Because when you get to this level, it's a very, very different game.And it's all new to me.",

It was that feeling of discovery, of something new every time you \"logged on.\" I thought about this for a while and finally started building a silly fun idea.\n\n  \n**A worldwide, anonymous question of the day app.** If you answer the question, then your postcard gets sent to a random person, and you get a random person's card. Each postcard gets sent out with a stamp of your country.\n\nEvery day, you open the app for a few minutes, collect a new stamp and postcard, read a little about a new culture or perspective, take a few moments to write something, then close the app and forget about it.  Quick, simple, joyful.\n\n  \nI finally launched it **2 weeks ago** on the Apple App Store. Since then, I've had over **500 downloads, 25+ countries participate, a peak day of 87 users**, and since then a fairly consistent 30-50 daily users. The reactions I've gotten from folks have been exactly spot on for the feeling I wanted to create, and the reason I made the app. I've got to read some enlightening and surprising cards and learned about different cultures in the process.\n\nI'm not sure where it will go or where I'll take it yet. I've already put a few UI updates out with more features and fixes. I just want to slowly build the daily active users and find people who really love it.\n\nIf you have an iPhone and want to check it out, DM me for a link!",

      "text": "I've been running businesses for 15 years. Salon, photo studio, events, now a tech startup. Different industries, different products - same audience. They just kept following me from one thing to the next.\n\nI never questioned it. Revenue is revenue, right? Clients are clients. People pay, product works, we grow. Except we don't grow. We just rotate.\n\nThe wake-up call came when I was helping a client figure out why her business wasn't scaling. I asked her one question: how many of your paying customers found you without knowing you first? She went quiet. Then I went quiet. Because I realized I'd never asked myself that same question.\n\nSo I sat down and mapped every single client from the last 9 months. The result was brutal: about 85% came from my existing network - old clients from previous businesses, friends of friends, Instagram followers who've known me for years. The ones I thought were \"new\"? Most came through warm referrals. Exactly ONE person found me completely cold through a YouTube video ( not my audience).\n\nThe funniest part? I genuinely believed it was close to 50/50. My brain literally rewrote the data to feel better about it.\n\nThis doesn't mean warm clients are bad. But it means I wasn't building a business - I was running a very expensive friendship. The real test isn't \"will people pay me.\" It's \"will strangers pay me.\"\n\nHas anyone else had this moment? That gut-punch realization that your \"traction\" was actually just your network being supportive? How did you shift to cold market and how long did it take to see real signal?",

      "text": "Lawsuits are one of those things most business owners don't think about until they're dealing with one. By then you're already in reactive mode, which is the worst place to be. Not legal advice. I am sharing a general checklist to get feedback from other operators.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce puts the average annual cost of fighting litigation at $1.2 million. Obviously most small businesses aren't spending that, but even a fraction of that number can be devastating when you're running lean. The real cost isn't just money though. It's the time, the stress and the distraction from actually running your business.\n\nHopefully it never comes to this. Here are the basics:\n\n**Business structure matters** \\- If you're still operating as a sole proprietorship, you're personally on the hook for everything.\n\nYour house, your savings, all of it. Converting to an LLC can create separation between business and personal assets if you keep clean books, separate accounts, and follow basic formalities.\n\nIt's not bulletproof, but it's a meaningful layer of protection that a lot of people put off for too long.\n\n**Documentation can be your best friend in a dispute** \\- Signed agreements, email trails, and notes from calls and meetings all create a paper trail that can resolve conflicts before they escalate.\n\nA simple email thread has sometimes been enough to shut down a potential lawsuit because it clearly showed what was agreed to and when.\n\nThe businesses that get burned are usually the ones operating on handshakes and verbal agreements.\n\n**Know a lawyer before you need one** \\- Scrambling to find legal counsel after you've already been served is not the time to be shopping around.\n\nA lot of businesses keep someone on retainer, but at minimum you should have a relationship with an attorney who understands your industry.\n\nThey can also help you stay compliant and review important documents before they become problems.\n\n**Understand what you're actually exposed to** \\- Common lawsuit categories for small businesses include discrimination claims, refusing service or not hiring based on protected classes, workplace harassment, breach of contract, slip and fall accidents, payment disputes with vendors or employees, and wrongful termination.\n\nMost of these are preventable with good policies, clear contracts and basic awareness of employment law.\n\n**Insurance is part of this equation** \\- General liability may help cover certain incidents and defense costs depending on the policy and exclusions.\n\nDepending on your business you might also need professional liability, workers' comp or commercial auto.\n\nThe point isn't to have insurance for everything, it's to understand where your real exposure is and make sure you're not carrying that risk alone.\n\nIf you do get sued, the first steps are usually the same. Call your lawyer, then notify your insurer. Timing and notice requirements can matter. Let them guide the process. A lot of disputes end in settlement, which isn't ideal but is usually better than a drawn out court battle that drains your resources.\n\nNone of this is groundbreaking, but I'm always surprised how many experienced operators haven't locked down these basics.\n\nWhat would you add or change based on what you have seen in your business?\n\n",

      "text": "Sharing because I struggled too much with this and maybe this saves someone else the trial and error.\n\nFirst one was ordering one color for everyone because it was simpler. Sounds fine in theory but when 80 people are all wearing the same navy polo at the company picnic it looks like a cult. People want options.\n\nSecond was guessing sizes based on what \"most people\" wear. Most people wear a large right? Wrong. We consistently over ordered larges and under ordered everything else. The leftovers pile grew every cycle.\n\nThird was buying bulk to save on per unit cost without accounting for waste. Yes the hoodies were $18 each instead of $30. But we also had 40 hoodies sitting in a closet six months later because they were the wrong sizes or a color nobody wanted. That's not savings that's inventory you're pretending doesn't have a cost.\n\nFourth was treating recognition as a scheduled event instead of a response to something someone actually did. Quarterly recognition feels corporate. Someone goes above and beyond on a Tuesday and you recognize them right then? That feels real.\n\nFifth was me personally picking items for everyone instead of letting them choose. I have great taste (debatable) but my taste is not everyone's taste. When we switched to letting people pick from a curated store through swaggy shop, the \"I never wear this stuff\" complaints stopped completely.\n\nNot groundbreaking advice but it took us three years to learn all of it so I figured writing it down might help someone skip a few of those steps.",

          "text": "The best swag we ever did was a 3 option you-pick-it. Each option was geared toward “pack it up and get going”. Pick one - premium personal item (under seat airplane) bag, premium laptop backpack/travel bag, premium 40L carry on bag. Personal item came with choice of color for a yeti bigger thermos, backpack came with slim yeti bottle, 40L came with yeti coffee cup. The bigger the bag, the more basic the yeti. \n\nSurprisingly, most people picked the laptop backpack across demographics. The feedback was ladies had oversized bags they already traveled with for personal items and men had duffles or laptop briefcases. And most people had a carryon bag already and didn’t want to store another one. The laptop bag (I think it was an Olio stuff top) proved to be the most versatile and the slim bottle fit perfectly in the side pouch. Felt more like an adaptable team than the other two options. \n\nThat year was expensive for corporate gifts, but we learned what people wanted - a cohesive capsule they could have ready to go for work-related activities. So next year, we did a single bag option with branded essential accessories (universal battery pack, toiletry bag, garment pouch, etc). The bag had three great features - color choice, low profile company branding and a top pocket that we loved for easy access to the things we chose for “essentials”. \n\nEveryone loved the single bag with flexibility on color, and our corporate thing became the “mystery bag” - people grew excited to see what bag option they’d have the next time. It gave us clear direction to keep within a reasonable budget, something our teams actually liked and flexibility to keep it fresh with the essentials. In 2020, this proved to be a culture piece everyone latched on to. COVID shutdown = no travel = no “need” for bags. We sent plain colorful paper bags full of PPE supplies, enrichment activities for all age groups and a calendar with pictures of our team. Felt a little cheesy, but because we had established “the bag” piece, everyone ended up loving it. \n\nTLDR - we did an expensive experiment and the results drove cost effective, well received culture lore that helped morale during unforeseen challenging times.",

      "text": "I keep reading about how affiliate marketing is the play for bootstrapped brands and I'm bought in on the concept but I'm getting confused by the software landscape. There's impact, partnerstack, refersion, and then a bunch of influencer platforms that also do affiliate stuff. Every comparison article reads like it was written by one of the companies themselves.\n\nHere's my situation. I sell a physical product online, we're doing okay revenue wise but I want to start turning customers and small creators into affiliates who earn commissions for driving sales. Nothing massive, just a simple program where people get a unique link or code, they share it, they earn a cut.\n\nBut I also want the ability to bring on bigger influencers later and manage those relationships too without needing a completely separate tool. Seems dumb to have one platform for affiliates and another for influencers when they're basically doing the same thing.\n\nThanks in advance for your tips.",

Easy setup, creators get links/codes, payouts are clean. No bloat.\n\nPhase 2 (when you start bringing in bigger creators):\nImpact and PartnerStack are more “enterprise partner program” tools. They’re powerful, but overkill unless you’re already doing serious volume.\n\nA lot of brands don’t actually need an “influencer platform.”\nThey just:\n\t1.\tTrack via affiliate software\n\t2.\tManage relationships manually (Notion/Sheets/Slack)\n\t3.\tUpgrade tooling only when ops becomes painful\n\nAlso — affiliates and influencers aren’t the same motion.\n\nAffiliates = performance-driven, long tail, automated.\nInfluencers = relationship-driven, negotiated rates, hybrid deals.\n\nTrying to force both into one clean system too early usually just adds cost.\n\nIf revenue is solid but not massive yet, I’d:\n\n• Start with a lightweight affiliate tool\n• Prove that affiliates actually move revenue\n• Then layer influencer workflows once you see traction\n\nCurious — what’s your current monthly revenue range?

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to ask this honestly because I’ve been struggling lately.\n\nOver the past few months, I’ve been cold outreaching nonstop trying to get traction on my business idea. I’m talking countless messages, follow-ups, refining the pitch, improving the demo… and still zero responses. Not even “no thanks.” Just silence. It’s been humbling in a way I wasn’t prepared for.\n\nOn top of that, I recently came across the statistic that less than 1% of entrepreneurs ever “strike it rich.” I know money isn’t supposed to be the only reason to build something, but I’d be lying if I said big success isn’t part of what drives me. Seeing that number kind of rattled me.\n\nLately I’ve been feeling like a hamster in a ball — constantly working, constantly moving, but not actually going anywhere.\n\nI used to be a lot more naive in a good way. I’d save pictures of big houses and cars and all the “dream life” stuff as motivation for when I eventually made it. It genuinely fueled me. But after months of getting ignored and reading those statistics, I ended up deleting all of it. It started feeling delusional instead of motivating. Now those numbers just sit in the back of my mind.\n\nIt’s even gotten to the point where I can’t really enjoy movies, sports, or anything with famous actors, athletes, or successful people. I just end up feeling jealous. They have what I’m working toward… and statistically, I might never get there.\n\nI haven’t given up. I’m still working. But lately I’ve been having long sessions where I just get overwhelmed and frustrated — sometimes to the point of tears — because it feels so hard to become successful on your own timeline. The gap between effort and visible reward feels brutal.\n\nSo I guess my question is:\n\nHow do you stay hopeful that your efforts will be rewarded someday?\n\nHow do you deal with the silence, the statistics, and the uncertainty without letting it crush your motivation?\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing how you all think about this.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the encouraging words and advice. I’ll be sure to reference this post and your words whenever I feel down during this process. I appreciate you all and hope the best for all of your personal endeavors.",

It’s the silence. You’re putting energy out and getting no signal back. That makes your brain assume the worst: “I’m delusional. This isn’t working. I’m wasting time.”\n\nCold outreach with zero replies isn’t a referendum on your potential. It’s feedback. Brutal, quiet feedback. And usually it means one of three things: wrong audience, wrong framing, or wrong problem. Not wrong person.\n\nThe 1% “strike it rich” stat is also misleading. Most entrepreneurs don’t fail because they lack talent. They fail because they chase outcomes instead of traction. The dream house and car imagery works until reality requires iteration. Then it feels like fantasy.\n\nYou don’t need to believe you’ll be wildly successful forever. You need one thing: evidence that your work creates response.\n\nSo shift the goal. Don’t aim for wealth right now. Aim for signal. One reply. One call. One paying user. If you can’t get responses, your job isn’t to grind harder, it’s to change the experiment.\n\nJealousy toward actors and athletes isn’t about them. It’s about you feeling stuck. That’s a traction problem, not a destiny problem.\n\nHere’s the uncomfortable but empowering question:\n\nIf outreach is getting zero response, what are you willing to radically change about the message or offer this week?\n\nHope comes back when movement becomes measurable again.",
