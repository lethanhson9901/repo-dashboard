      "text": "Give or take a few days, my mate started his \"boutique\" gym around this time last year. Focusing on \"hyper-personalised\" training programs.\n\nWhen he first invested a ton of cash into matte black paint, equipment, big frameless mirrors, motivational quotes on the walls, I thought he'd gone mad. I didn't see much traction for the first couple of months.\n\nBut now he charges £80 per 90 minute personal training session. His personal trainers are not really certified at all, they're just fit looking university students he pays £15 an hour.\n\nBefore each client's first session they fill out a detailed questionnaire on this iPad with their goals, injuries, experience level, all the usual stuff. They even pose for a few \"before\" pics.\n\nThen everything is uploaded straight to ChatGPT and it spits out a 12 week progressive program, exercise form cues and even some motivational talking points tailored to that specific client.\n\nThen all these trainers do is pull up the program on their phone and just guide clients through it. They are literally reading the ChatGPT response word for word.\n\nHe charges £80 per session and has on average 4 sessions a day across 5 different trainers. The average client books 2 sessions a week for at least 3 months.\n\nRight now monthly revenue is around 40k with trainer costs being about 11k and the gym overhead is 5k so there's approx 24k a month left. And yeah, I know that is not pure profit, you have to account for equipment lease costs, corp tax, other bills and all that.\n\nSo far nobody has complained and he keeps saying ChatGPT has access to thousands of peer-reviewed studies and decades of training data, it's  qualified enough.\n\nNow, here is where it gets interesting cos he wants me to help him scale this to 2 more locations. I don't think any other locations would come close to the central parts of London but he says there are many cities this would work.\n\nIs this a smart scalable business or am I helping him build a house of cards?",

Expecting ai to fill that consistent relatable peer support role is like thinking buying an alarm clock will automatically make you a morning person.\n\n  \nEven Layne norton, a long time professional trainer and phd nutritionist, with clear incentive to promote his own training, has himself admitted that he wouldve rather studied behavior change than nutrition in school. Because most people coming to him for training already have made the first step (choosing to get a trainer), and he realized he can't take honest responsibility for their initial progress. It's more about sustaining that motivation over the long term (where most clients drop off). That's a lot more nuanced than spitting out a 12 week bodybuilding template.",

Ignoring \"across\" and multiplying by 5 gets closer but approximately 500+ sessions per month seems unlikely. 5 instructors are working 6 hrs per day, every day (4\\*90min) but are students?\n\nWhat do you bring? Why does he need you to scale? There wouldn't happen to be a franchise fee payable by you to him would there? ;)",

Its a race to the bottom when everyone can do the same thing with zero barrier to entry. High selling trainers go out on their own, long term clients dont need the service anymore etc. You need more upsells, you need actual value add other than spitting out programs. You need drilling on behavior change, individualized nutrition support, etc. These things take expertise and time, the margins get thinner, etc.\n\nGyms can have captive audiences, unique offerings, value adds that succeed more often. Larry Wheels gym succeeded because he didnt need to buy equipment and got sponsor companies, on top of being famous in the fitness space.\n\nHormozi succeeded by overselling old-school sales funnels most people will laugh at today and think are obvious scams. (12 week \"challenges\" with shady money back practices). You can't do that anymore with the same consistency.\n\nCreate an actual business plan with unique offerings and really sell the human aspect rather than the idea of spitting out template programs.\n\nIt works if you are a huge influencer or successful in a unique niche. Not so much if you are a random selling templates. If youre not trying to become an influencer, actually use that as a selling point to be more relatable (you are selling the peer support and individualized motivation, you understand peoples pain points, youre not just some cash grab influencer trash).",

Still waiting for that magical vendor to do it...\n\nSame story as 7-8 years ago, where all the BI and data analytics platforms were going to \"just work\" when you plug them onto your database or dump your 70 excel spreadsheets that no one can be bothered to clean into them, and will start generating reports, dashboards and data you can sell.  \n  \nDidn't work as advertised then, doesn't now, isn't going to later.",

Some middle manager dumbass who ass kissed their way into their role gets suckered by surface level salesman bs into buying a shiny new tool, what follows is a pathetic “integration” that hardly gets the bare bones working \n\nOf course without doing any of the hard work ensuring proper technical support, clear technical outcomes, aligning internal processes or having a clean data structure. \n\nSaid tool can’t be iterated on, has a million caveats, is constantly incorrect and the support evaporates within months as they move onto new clients. Ends up functionally useless for the purpose it was intended for. ROI in the bin, a ton of time and money wasted \n\nAnd then they learn nothing and do it all again with the next provider.

In particular, it has no notion of facts (if it did, it would be a lot better at math.). All an LLM is \"given the set of words previous, what is a high likelihood (but also random, or you would get the same answer over and over) set of words to come next.\"  That's it.\n\nYou can give it instructions but there is no facts and no knowledge.  The longer a conversation goes, the more conversation is there is to dilute whatever instructions you initially gave it.\n\nAI cannot reliably work in a fact-based world, and it's not going to any time soon.  The people selling it know this, btw.  Both OpenAI and the chatbot companies.\n\nIt kind of works in software, sometimes, because you can rapidly evaluate the output for correctness.

If you've just installed it and pointed it at your website for information, then that's simply not enough.\n\nUsually, people get away with it by strongly limiting the amount of information it can give out, but it sounds like you want yours to act like it's a knowledgeable human and answer any question it's answered.\n\nHow much training have to you done? What's your setup prompt look like?\n\nWhat systems are you trying, too? This will make a big difference, as I'd hope the more established (more expensive) ones have put some of this groundwork in for you, whereas someone doing it for you for peanuts, or a DIY solution, will be missing all of this setup and control.",

People give the AI a vague request or dump a pile of information on it and expect it to somehow know what matters, what it should ignore, and where the lines are.\n\nWhen it doesn’t have that clarity, it doesn’t stop. It guesses. That’s where a lot of the “why is it making stuff up?” anger comes from.\n\nI ended up putting together a short guide after watching this play out a lot. Not to fix backend systems, but to help people better understand how missing context, loose instructions, and unclear expectations push the AI into filling in the gaps.\n\nClean data helps, but it doesn’t fix the part where people assume the AI knows what matters. If you don’t spell that out, it’ll happily make something up and move on.",

There is nothing more terrifying for a business owner than an AI \"manifesting\" fake discount codes or lying about product safety. That jewelry story is a nightmare.\n\nThe real issue is that most of these bot companies are just selling \"fancy autocomplete.\" They use ChatGPT to be creative, but in business, you don’t want a creative bot—you want a factual one.\n\nI’m actually building a support tool right now specifically to kill this hallucination problem. I use something called RAG, which basically forces the AI to keep its \"eyes\" on your docs only. If the info isn't explicitly in your product descriptions or settings, the bot is literally not allowed to make it up. It’s an \"open book\" system—no data, no answer.\n\nI also added a floating WhatsApp/Call button alongside the chat because, let's be real, sometimes a bot just isn't enough and the customer needs a human immediately.\n\nYou’ve clearly been through the ringer with those 3 bots. If you're up for it, I’d love for you to \"stress-test\" what I’ve built. No charge, no sales pitch—I just want to see if you can break my guardrails. I’d rather a bot say \"I don't know\" than commit fraud against your customers lol.",

That was me.\n\nAt some point I read something very simple, it said stop thinking about 10k and just try to make 1 dollar. That sentence stayed in my head.\n\nSo in June I just tried to make 1 dollar online, nothing more. I’m in the surf niche, so I made a simple inside joke design, put it on a mug because mugs felt low risk, built a Shopify store in about 2 days and ran some ads.\n\nWhen the first sale came in and I saw that 1 dollar, I just stared at the screen for a moment. After almost 2 years of zero, it felt unreal.\n\nAt the beginning it wasn’t really profitable and some days I was just happy I didn’t lose money, but I kept changing small things, reading a bit, trying again, and then it clicked.\n\nIn around 20 days I sold about 400 mugs and made a bit over 2k profit.\n\nWhat surprised me the most wasn’t even the money, but what happened after I started really working instead of just thinking, because suddenly I understood how things actually work, I learned more in a few weeks than in the 2 years before, and I started seeing opportunities everywhere.\n\nIdeas stopped feeling like fantasies and more like things I could actually test, and that feeling alone is fucking gold.\n\nI’m still learning and still figuring things out, but I remember how stuck I felt before and just wanted to share this, maybe it helps someone who’s in that same place right now.\n\nThat’s it.

      "text": "So still most people in Kenya still rely on mobile data bundles for internet access and in all honesty Safaricom (and friends) absolutely milk that system. Bundles expire, speeds drop, and you’re paying more for less. Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is cheaper, more convenient, and way more scalable… if you can get it close to people.\n\nI live in a fairly remote area, but I’m close to a market that’s still developing. One day a friend visited me and casually suggested I try running a Wi-Fi hotspot around there. At first, I didn’t take it seriously. I assumed everyone would just use Safaricom bundles for those unable  to buy wifi installation services,so I didn’t see why anyone would pay for local Wi-Fi.\nAfter thinking about it for a while, I decided to try anyway purely as an experiment.\n\nI didn’t start big or spend much. I used a second-hand MikroTik router my friend sold me, added a basic Tenda router, and connected everything to my existing Airtel 5G line, which I already pay for monthly. We ran a long Ethernet cable outside, mounted the equipment in a small box, and pointed the antennas toward the market. That was the entire setup.\n\nOn the first day, from around 10am to midnight, I made about 1,200 KES. I assumed it was just people being curious and trying something new. But the same thing happened the next day, and the day after that. On slower days I make around 1,500 KES, and on good days it goes up to about 2,000 KES.Crazy!!\n\nWithin about a week, I had recovered all my initial costs. That’s when it stopped feeling like a small side experiment and started feeling like a real opportunity.\n\nLater, a friend showed me his own dashboard. He averages around 15,000 KES per day. He also mentioned others who earn much more, but those setups are larger fiber connections, multiple locations, and years of gradual expansion. That’s when I realized this business doesn’t grow overnight. It grows with infrastructure, patience, and consistency.\n\nThe hardest part for me wasn’t the money or the hardware. It was learning how to configure MikroTik properly and setting up the billing system. Without guidance, I probably would have quit early out of frustration. Once everything was configured correctly, though, the system became fairly stable and mostly runs itself.\n\nI’m not posting this to sell anything or claim I’ve figured everything out. I just wanted to share an honest experience for anyone who’s curious . You can start small, learn as you go, and grow slowly while doing things properly over time.\n\nEstimated capital (based on my setup)\nMikroTik router  5,000 KES\nTenda router 1,500 KES\nBilling system (iterativebilling.com)  1,000 KES\nAirtel 5G internet 3,000 KES\nElectricity 1,500 KES per month\nTotal: 12,000 KES\n\nThis could definitely grow into something bigger, but it would require an big investors for better equipment, stronger infrastructure, and proper licensing. I’m still researching the regulatory side and long term setup. With the right investment and planning, this could be a solid business, especially in underserved areas.",

      "text": "I've seen hundreds of pitch decks, met dozens of founders in 2025, and made dozens of pitch decks. Talked to many investors and asked their insights about pitch decks for whole year. Here is what I learned this year:\n\n1. **The problem slide is where you win or lose.** If an investor doesn't lean forward on slide 2, the rest doesn't matter. Most founders bury their best insight on slide 8.\n2. **Founders who've experienced the problem they're solving tell better stories.** Personal connection > market research every single time.\n3. **The \"platform\" word is poison.** I removed it from at least 10 decks this year. Just tell me what the thing actually does.\n4. **Traction without context is useless.** \"10K users\" means nothing. \"10K users, 23% MoM growth, $47 average revenue per user\" means something.\n5. **Most market size slides are bullshit, and investors know it.** TAM/SAM/SOM with numbers pulled from Statista doesn't impress anyone. Show me YOUR math based on YOUR customer segments.\n6. **Financial projections are fiction, but they reveal how you think.** Show you understand unit economics and investors will forgive aggressive growth assumptions. Show hockey sticks with no underlying logic and investors will assume you don't know your business.\n7. **The team slide should answer \"why you, why now.\"** Your advisor's LinkedIn profile doesn't matter. Your 10 years solving this exact problem does.\n8. **Asking for money without showing what milestones is just amateur.** \"We need $2M for hiring and marketing\" isn't a plan. \"$2M gets us to $100K MRR and 18-month runway\" is.\n9. **Design matters less than founders think, but more than they act like it does.** Your deck doesn't need to be gorgeous, but it can't look like you don't give a shit.\n10. **Every deck should answer: what's the insight only you have?** If I could've thought of your idea without domain expertise, it's not compelling enough.\n11. **Slide count doesn't matter.** Based on my experience and Carta's insights, there's no correlation between slide number and fundraising success. If a slide is meaningful, keep it. If a slide is just \"nice to have,\" remove it.\n12. **Founders confuse features with benefits.** \"AI-powered matching algorithm\" doesn't mean shit to anyone. \"Cuts hiring time from 60 days to 12\" does.\n13. **The fundraising story matters as much as the business story.** Why this round, why this amount, why now etc. If you can't articulate it clearly, investors smell desperation.\n14. **The decks that got funded weren't perfect but they were clear.** Clarity beats cleverness every single time.\n15. **Nobody reads Slide 1 (Cover slide).** They glance at it for 3 seconds. If your tagline is a paragraph, you've already lost.\n16. **\"AI\" is a feature, not a business.** In Q1 2025, slapping \"AI\" on a slide worked. Now? It's noise. Tell me what problem you solve, not what tech stack you use.\n17. **The \"Conservative Estimate\" Lie.** We know your Year 5 projection of $100M ARR is fake. You know it's fake. Focus on how you get the first $1M instead of giving huge promises.\n18. **One idea per slide.** I see founders trying to cram the Problem, Solution, and Market Size onto one slide to \"save space.\" Don't. It looks like a random note.\n19. **Your TAM is wrong.** If you claim your Total Addressable Market is \"The Global Internet,\" you don't know who your customer is. Niche down.\n20. **Font size 10 is illegal.** If an investor has to squint to read your LTV/CAC ratio on a mobile screen, they're closing the file.\n21. **Bullet points are boring.** Use icons, use charts, use big numbers. Walls of text are for legal contracts, not pitch decks.\n22. **Stop using \"Uber for X.\"** It's almost 2026. Come up with your own category.\n23. **The Appendix is your best friend.** Keep the main deck short and tell your story clearly. Put the technical deep dives in the appendix.\n24. **PDF is the only format.** Don't send a Keynote. Don't send a PPT. Fonts break. Layouts shift. Send a PDF.\n25. **Your \"Exit Strategy\" is presumptuous.** You haven't sold one unit yet. Don't tell me about your IPO plans.\n26. **Data needs context.** Don't just show a graph going up. Label the axes. Explain the spike. Everybody love labeled axes.\n27. **Consistency signals competence.** If your headers jump around and your colors shift slightly, investors subconsciously think your code is messy too.\n28. **Frameworks kill the story.** Most founders try to use famous frameworks. But those frameworks push founders to be standard. Instead of this, create your own story.\n29. **Competition slide is your positioning.** Everybody knows you cannot compete with Google, Apple, OpenAI or other big corporates. But you really can focus a niche and grow in a vertical. You don't have to write a complex competition slide. X-Y landscape is great but you have to choose the right X and Y angles and be perfect on your niche.\n30. **Don't separate \"Why Now\" into its own slide.** Weave it naturally into your problem (it's urgent), market (it's shifting), and competition (giants are slow). When \"why now\" is isolated, it feels forced.\n\n**My predictions for 2026:**\n\n**AI will review your deck before humans do.** I've talked to investors and many of them are already using AI reviews, custom GPTs, Claude, Gemini on their emails. Your pitch deck isn't just for humans anymore. You need to explain your business to AI too. Find the balance: clear enough for AI to understand, compelling enough for humans to care.\n\n**Pre-seed rounds will get harder.** Building an MVP is easier than ever thanks to AI. So investors are asking for revenue or real traction even at pre-seed, and their bar will keep rising. My advice? Generate traction first, fundraise later -when it is possible of course. (And possible doesn't mean \"if you have money\", it means \"if it is possible as technical\")\n\n**Investor outreach will be noisier than ever.** Automation tools are everywhere now. Anyone can build a bulk email campaign to investors. Standing out will require actual creativity, not just another cold email template. The spray-and-pray approach is literally dead.",

The point about AI reviewing decks before humans really hit home, it’s the next big hurdle for founders.\n\nThat prediction is exactly why I built a custom “Pitch Deck Analyst” agent on GenSpark. I trained it on feedback from actual investors (and posts like this!). Now, when I feed it a draft, it acts like that brutally honest pre-screening AI you mentioned. It flags stuff like: “Your ‘10K users’ claim has no context,” or “Slide 5 crams problem and solution, pick one,” or “Your financials jump without a clear ‘how’.” It’s my sandbox to pressure-test decks for both AI clarity and human appeal before they go out the door.\n\nBuilding this kind of targeted agent is what platforms like GenSpark are great for. It’s become an indispensable tool to navigate exactly the future you’re describing.",

I already had some client relationships and leads connected to the region, and the market here values execution and speed more than just pitch decks. Cost of living is definitely higher, which is exactly why I didn’t come in blind — there’s runway planned and expenses are controlled, especially in the first phase.\n\nOn the agency side, I agree it’s saturated if you’re generic. We’re not positioning as a full-stack “we do everything” digital agency. The focus is performance-driven content and production — short-form video, UGC-style creatives, and ads that actually convert, not just look good. That’s where most brands here are still weak.\n\nGeographic arbitrage alone doesn’t work long term. The play is specialization + execution, not location hype. UAE just happens to be a market where that combo gets rewarded faster if you deliver.\n\nHappy to break down the numbers or strategy further if you’re genuinely curious.",

For someone with ADHD, interest isn’t always persistent. Motivation fluctuates, and it’s easy to slip into a procrastination loop.\n\nThat loop can be costly. lost time, wasted money, missed opportunities, and unrealized potential, often with nothing tangible to show for the effort until the business finally becomes profitable. Unlike a regular job, entrepreneurship offers no immediate structure, deadlines, or external accountability. You’re responsible not only for execution, but also for creating your own systems, discipline, and momentum.\n\nSo realistically, how do you manage everything? How do you stay focused when your brain constantly seeks novelty? How do you build consistency when your energy comes in waves? And how do you protect yourself from burnout, self-doubt, and paralysis while still pushing forward in a world that rewards long-term persistence?",

Way too many people, including you just now, use the word \"discipline\" and I think that hinders success. Because tons of people recognize that they need \"discipline\" but I don't think very many of them actually know what it is. Discipline is simply having a code or set of rules that you follow, and actually following it. Want to know an *extremely* easy way to do that? Set a schedule. Having and following a schedule *is* discipline. Any time you see the word discipline, change it out for scheduling. No schedule? No discipline. Plain and simple.     \n    \nWe ***know*** scheduling works. Look at every school on the planet. Did you go to history class or geometry when you \"felt like it\" or \"were in the mood\"? No. You went when the bell rang because there was a schedule. And people who haven't been in a classroom in 20+ years still wake up in a cold sweat from time to time after having a *nightmare* they were late to class. Why? Because scheduling has an extremely potent psychological effect.    \n    \nIf you want to succeed, set a schedule. On $DAY at $TIME for $DURATION I'm going to do $SPECIFIC_TASK.   \n    \nIf you don't know when to set your schedule, 10:00AM to 12:00PM on Sundays is your new time to work on your schedule, and you will set your schedule for the following two weeks. Adjust as needed. And make your schedule obvious so that it's something you look at every day. It needs to be somewhere where you are unable to miss it.   \n    \nI also want to mention that sometimes we don't have things broken down enough yet to get a good specific task out of them. Taking the time to figure out specific tasks of a larger project is itself a task that you need to schedule and do.",

          "text": "Personally, time management and ADHD management is a skill you have to develop through your lifetime, your the only one who knows how you work so you gotta experiment. But i'll share with what I did personally. Some people mention medication, for me I refuse to get medicated but to each man his own.\n\n1. Time Management For me personally I use Google Calendar, Notion Calendar, And Notion for Task and Schedule management. I have elaborate pages that carries out all my tasks, and have a recurring task even so I don't have to redo them. I have 2 Notion pages mainly for my life, and for my work. I will probably have another one as I start a family or a business. These are my holy grail but find what works for you.\n2. Timers For me to stay on track and focused, I need to be disciplined. I use timer for everything. there's two main things to use it for Time Boxing and Pomodoro\n\nPomodoro - Use it for long tasks so you can pace yourself well and not burn out \\[30min work - 5min break, 3 rounds then a 30min break, do the ratio that works for you\\]\n\nTimeboxing - Use for pretty much any tasks especially when you feel like procrastinating, we procrastinate because we already calculate in our heads how much work its gonna take so we'd rather not do it. You have to trick your brain to overcome it, instead of going to the gym for 1 hour, tell yoursel out loud, i'm gonna wear my shoes for 2 mins \\*start the timer for 2 mins, i'm gonna drive to the gym for 10 mins \\*start timer for 10 mins, etc.  \nHere are the links (sure you can use your iphone timer, but you may get distracted):  \nI use 2 timers, 1 hand held and 1 for desk, you can DM me for the amazon link.\n\n3. Brain Dumping and Journaling  \nFor ADHDers like us its as if we have 5 different thoughts occuring at once, you should know that unless these thoughts are acknowledged its gonna keep running in your head forever, overwhelming you. You need something to pour your thoughts too right away. I either use the note app on my iphone or I carry around a pocket notepad, I literally right down everything that comes up \"theres a show I wanna watch!\" or \"I need to get my tire changed\" or \"I wonder how babies are made\". Then later on when you have time, you can go over your notes and put it on your task manager and do them. You should probably journal too.\n\n4. Health  \nTake care of you physical and mental health. The more unhealthy you are the more difficult it is to manage yourself and the more unstable you are. Get proper sleep, eat right, take some time to exercise, and maintain your emotions through journaling. Cut off or atleast moderate unhealthy habits (junkfood, doom scrolling, porn). You mention your brain seeks novelty, sure. I think its mainly stimulation and dopamine, if your healthy your brain doesn't need so much to function (If you do high dopamine activities such as doom scrolling of course your not gonna find going on a nice stroll \"novel\") You can use stimulants like coffee and energy drinks but these are short term solutions to long term problems, keep yourself healthy and you will rarely reach for the caffeine.\n\n5. Scheduling  \nKnow your biology, your body functions on different energy levels throughout the day, experiment and find your magic spot. You can't do high level energy activities all day, you will burn out. For me my schedule is divided to 3 parts 6am-1pm Deep Hard Work 1pm-2pm Lunch 2pm-7pm Moderate Level Work 7pm-8pm dinner 8pm-11pm Low Energy / Relax > Sleep\n\nThere's more things I will share on my comment below",

              "text": "6. Consistency  \nDon't push yourself too hard, the turtle wins the race, small incremental steps build in the long run over inconsistent sprints. (Better for you to set 20 min workouts a day consistently than set 60 min hard workout but you fail and only do twice). Do something I call \"Minimum Winning\" If you can't do something because you don't have time or too tired, do the absolute bare minimum to at least say you did it! (Too tired to go on a run? Just put on your shoes walk outside and walk back in, that counts!) This teaches you to remain consistent for the long term.\n\n7. Active Practice  \nBecause of ADHD we easily get into this sort of thought, planning paralysis. Executive Dysfunction. We analyze more and plan but we barely do. For example i'm giving you a lot of info, take some time to absorb this slowly. Practice more than learning. Its hard to explain this but pretty much keep your theory to practice ratio to about 1/5. Don't fall into a trap of reading all the self help books and watching youtube videos but never doing any of it. Just take it one at a time, take small bites and chew thoroughly.\n\n8. Mindfulness  \nThis is my last one. Your mindset plays a lot of role into this, so keep your mental healthy. Try to do some journaling, practice things such as self forgiveness, your never gonna be perfect, your days won't be perfect, you will fail and fall, bad days come, your plans don't go according to plan. Accept this, learn, and get up again. Learn to manage your emotions, I'm very sensitive and emotional, if my heart is troubled I can't do anything but sit and dwell on it, I fall to depression sometimes. Manage yourself so you catch yourself before you hit rock bottom. If you do hit it, that's fine the only way is up :)\n\nIts a lot but its really helped me and I hope it helps you and others who read this.\n\nCheck this guy on youtube his name is Newel of Knowledge, these 3 videos helped me get out of depression.  \n1 How to do hard things  \n2 How to manage emotion  \n3 How to Resist Temptation",

Also think of things that do sustain your interest over long periods of time - what qualities do those things have, can you replicate those qualities in your work?\n\nI find I can focus easily on spreadsheet related tasks and not so well on long form writing so I try to make everything into ‘fill out a spreadsheet’ even if it is writing so I trick myself into the buzz that comes from a nice looking well-organized spreadsheet and if that also means all my product descriptions are written - well good for me!!\n\nYeah don’t try to work like a person without ADHD I think medication can also be really helpful, but if interest is your motivation then find ways to make yourself interested.",

One meaningful task done beats ten half-started ones.\n\nI also force external pressure because self-motivation is unreliable. Deadlines with other people, public commitments, even casual check-ins keep me moving. And when my brain wants novelty, I let it switch tasks instead of doom-scrolling.

They don't want to shut you down in a conversation so they engage, ask questions, and make you feel heard. Then they go back to their lives and forget you exist. With our clients doing early validation the breakthrough moment is always when someone does something unprompted that costs them time or effort.\n\nThe question that separates real from fake is asking them to commit to something small right now. Not later, not hypothetically. \"Can I send you a rough prototype next week and get 15 minutes of feedback?\" If they say yes and actually respond when you send it, that's signal. If they hedge or go silent, the interest was performative.\n\nStop counting positive conversations and start counting actions taken. Ten people who said \"sounds interesting\" means nothing. One person who asked to be first in line when you launch means everything.",

I called it the “Estate Preparation Package.” The goal was simple. Help families organize critical estate information so the people left behind were not scrambling.\n\nWhat I did not anticipate was the confusion.\n\nA lot of people assumed they were buying a will or legal documents and I lost them in the funnel. That was not the product. I was solving an organization and action problem, not a legal drafting problem. But the name and framing were bad.\n\nSo I made a change.\n\nI renamed the product the CLEAR Kit. It became both a product name and an acronym. (Comprehensive legacy and estate administration repository.) It sounded tangible, not like a professional service, but more importantly it clarified what it was (and just as importantly what it was not).\n\nSales tripled.\n\nRecently, I made another set of changes that were far less dramatic but just as intentional. I rewrote the product page to focus on benefits instead of features. Less about what is included, more about what families can actually do with it. I also cleaned up metadata across Shopify so the product was easier to understand by both people and search engines.\n\nSales tripled again.\n\nNo viral moment. No massive rebrand. No new product.\n\nJust clearer language, better positioning, and a willingness to admit that confusion is usually our fault as founders.\n\nThe lesson I keep relearning is this. Incremental improvements stack. When you remove friction at multiple small points, the cumulative effect can be enormous.\n\nIf something isn't converting, don't assume the idea is broken.

      "text": "TL;DR - the ups and (many many) downs of starting your own agency, semi enjoyable read. Lessons Learnt at the end, for anyone in a similar position.\n\n\n\nStarted out in the space 2024, I lost my job working at a startup and decided to go freelance. And here is what 2025 looked like as the first FULL year as an agency owner starting from 0.\n\n\n\nTried to keep concise and pragmatic.\n\n\n\nQ1 - INITIAL EXCITMENT\n\n\n\nStarted the year well, we had a project lined up for building an AI SDR for a French startup. Things started well, but scope creeped to always adding more features, when pushing back to sign the contract. Suddenly not a priority anymore.\n\n\n\nThis then led to a huge outreach effort and SM posting about the solution. At this time the solution was featured on Liam Ottley’s YT video, that coupled with some viral reddit posts. Led us to onboard 5 ish clients. Had salesforce knock on the door - small flex (lol)\n\n\n\nQ2 - MAKING THE BEST OF AN OPPORTUNITY\n\n\n\nWe did the classic, onboarded too much. Which led to the inevitable, reduction in performance and lesser outcomes for clients. Churn kicked us in the stomach.\n\n\n\nFrom here partnerships with pre-existing agencies to do AI and Dev work began. Being given projects without full say on the scope, was pretty rough. Had projects to deliver 10 AI agents … \n\n\n\nBut was good cashflow, and ultimately this is when the 12 hour days started. As the projects were sold off the back of AI will replace a team of people. Scopes were ENORMOUS, and we foolishly said yes :L\n\n\n\nQ3 - THE REAL SH-T SHOW BEGINS\n\n\n\nWorking 6-7 days a week become normal & 24/7 stress.\n\n\n\nThis is when the sizes of projects became TRULY apparent. And when I truly discovered the REAL limits of AI. What will work well 85% of the time is a few weeks of intense work. And  going from 85 —> 90% effectiveness is an exponential journey (months), 1 change in the AI (prompt) will throw things off wildly, and testing becomes 10x longer…\n\n\n\nTried to partner with another agency, didn’t go too well. From being in the trenches fixing things 24/7 led me to almost forget how to delegate work effectively. \n\n\n\nOn a positive - somehow managed to start sitting at tables at billion dollar companies, speaking with legitimate 30yr IT professionals about integrating AI. Being a young guy led to many - “who tf is this?” - having a baby face didn’t help either XD\n\n\n\n\\> Also discovered, EVERYONE loves talking about AI but can never go deeper with actually how it works in the real world.\n\n\n\nQ4 - SALVAGING FROM RUINS\n\n\n\nStarted consuming monstrous amounts of caffeine, and fights with the partner became more frequent. With having such variable income, meant having no time for the relationship. Date night perma cancelled, quality netlfix time became laptop and chill (lol)\n\nRounding off the year, was mainly finising up the larger projects. Tried to hire devs offshore, absolute mess. Tried to charge 200USD for setting up a GitHub repo and 1 meeting - yikes\n\n  \nBuild systems that genuinely worked well. From Automated mood board creation for interior designers, Reactivation campaigns for Mortgage company with Voice AI, Many RAG systems. An SEO blog automation which basically replaced a team … And many smaller jobs here and there.\n\n\n\nLESSONS LEARNT:\n\n* Don’t sell features - if you sell features - you will always add more features to seal the deal\n* Don’t try to rush the delicate art of negotiating a deal. It WILL backfire on you\n* Onboarding hype is REAL for AI projects. Manage expectations ASAP - it will take twice as long and fail in unexpected ways\n* NEVER do free work - 2 weeks to get a demo, then boom ghosted\n* !! Reddit inbound (content) is the way forward !!\n* Have time for play - reset your mind and allows you to get back to “normal”\n* Voice AI is probably the best use case vs effort to implement.\n* Sk00L is SURPRISINGLY good for landing clients\n\n\n\nMY PERSONAL HUNCHES FOR 2026:\n\n* The Claude Code framework will be the default framework for AI agent teams\n* N8N and workflow automation tools will be replaced by agentic / vibe coding (controversial - I know). The hype around April / June was insane, I think it will die down\n* I will enjoy using Lang chain ……. -  this will never happen XD\n\n\n\nInterested to see whose year was a roller coaster as well! \n\n",

Quality was inconsistent because some days I had ideas and energy, other days I was just forcing it\n\nI switched to batching everything on monday mornings. Block out 3 hours, create all my content for the week in one focused session and thats way more efficient because I'm in the creative zone and not context switching constantly.\n\nHere's my actual process now: I brainstorm 5-7 content ideas on sunday night, just write them down in notion then monday morning I create all of them back to back. Usually ends up being like 15-20 pieces of content once I break things down for different platforms\n\nIm using blotato to handle the platform specific formatting so I'm not manually resizing everything and adjusting captions for linkedin vs instagram vs twitter. That alone saves probably like 2 hours\n\nI went from spending roughly 11 hours per week on content spread throughout the week to about 3 hours on monday. Freed up 8 hours that I'm using for actual revenue generating work now and content quality is more consistent too because I'm not forcing creativity every single day, sometimes you just dont have it and that's fine",

A few bucks on an LLM, maybe another tool, and everything feels incremental.\n\nThe real cost shows up when you hit that wall. The code mostly works, the bug is subtle, and the AI keeps guessing. Every suggestion sounds right. None of them fix it. Looping (is there a better term for the hell?).\n\nSo you keep going. Another prompt. Another hour gone.\n\nBeing humans, I dunno is this our primordial brains, there’s no invoice, we treat that time as free. But it isn’t. It’s lost momentum, burned weekends, and shipping later than planned.\n\nMost people will spend four or five hours stuck just to avoid paying for ten minutes of certainty.\n\nBringing a human in has risks. Trust, context, security. That hesitation makes sense. But looping with AI isn’t risk-free either, it just hides the cost.\n\nAt some point the question becomes simple: what is your time actually worth when you’re stuck?\n\nCurious how others handle that moment. Do you grind it out, or do you have a rule for escalating?",

Code comes and bite you.** Producing code is not the hard part. Translating your objectives to as little code, of as much quality as possible, is the difficult part.\n\n*Every software project has a life expectancy.* Over time, you fix bugs, change things, follow trends, implement features. And inexorably, code quality degrades, more bugs pop up, or you find out that the easy feature is actually super complicated to implement given the current state of the code base.\n\nWhen you are a young inexperienced developer, you code with limited foresight and architecture expertise. The life expectancy of the software is then usually a few months or a year of daily modifications. As you gain experience and skill, your software gets a longer expected lifespan. Top developers that I've met or witnessed the work of (I'm talking open-source project leaders in their fifties) are able to write code with a life expectancy of about 15 to 20 years.\n\nYou see? **At no point I'm saying that producing the code is difficult**. I'm saying that producing code that you will not have to reinvest time into later on is difficult. And, sadly, LLMs are very novice programmers. Yes, they have been trained on lots of code. They know lots of class and function names. But they spit out the most naive solution to your prompt, with no foresight or architecture.\n\nI may be a bit extreme, but for the moment, my evaluations of vibe coding tools and AI-completions in IDEs is quite negative. My colleagues using this experience much lower software life expectancy, and way more bugs. To me, this is injecting poison in your project.",

          "text": "Yeah, finding a competent engineering founder and convincing them to take less money is a huge sales job.\n\n1) Finding is very hard. As an Engineer who founded startups, I'm so glad I didn't have to go through that. Just because you find someone who can code doesnt give you any sense of whether or not they can built the app. Most \"Engineers\" are really coders who can take direction.\n\n2) \"startup mindset is so easy to claim but so hard to actually find in the wild\" True. Almost no engineer wants to take much of a pay cut, let alone what you can probably afford.\n\nYour hardest task is identifying the right person, agencies are sell, so they just cost extra and will claim every engineer they rep can build an MVP. It's your job to not only find and filter, but to SELL TO THEM.\n\nMany Engineers who can take an app from begining to end have their own projects. Even those who can't run the process end-2-end are hard to sell. Those with a track record often have bidding wars.\n\n3) You're gonna hate hearing this, but if you think 6 months isn't worth finding the right person and selling them on your idea, its over. \n\nAs I mentioned before, just finding the right person is a huge accomplishment. There is no place you can just go and find these types. And not being technical, I can't imagine how you could validate them. So the first two parts are unimaginably hard, but then you're hoping to recruit them.\n\nI suggest you repost what you want and get specific about what you're doing in the hopes of attracting the right people. The info you posted, so far, doesn't pain an alluring image. You're struggling with money (typical, I often have to self fund), you dont seem to have an adopter, which calls into question if your idea has merit. Do you know what tech skills you need? What are you going to do for the project? If your just the idea guy, there's nothing to talk about.",

Perhaps start while you are still working and see if you like it, or if your idea can see some success.

Eventually I have a multitude of businesses running circling the same industry and in technology and they are doing fantastic.  I still work my job because that is my stability.

And then - it's like they switched something. A flood of similar 1-2 star reviews started. No details, template-like. Clearly the work of \"well-wishers.\"\n\nLike many, I first went the official route: polite responses, requests to real clients, endless complaints to Google support. Result - zero. The system just ignores them. These fakes are like nails hammered into the first page of search results for my name. Inquiries from new clients have dropped to almost zero. I feel completely powerless.\n\nNow I'm reading, looking for solutions. Came across information about snow monkey+block chain pr agency. A strange combination - on one hand, a monkey (probably agility and speed), on the other - blockchain (tech-savviness and transparency?). I understand I don't just need support, but \"heavy artillery\": someone who can apply legal pressure and technically \"bury\" this negativity in search results at the same time. But that's probably astronomically expensive for a small business, right? Or are there options?\n\nReally need advice from those who have already pulled their project out of such a hole.\n\nWhen did you realize you couldn't handle it on your own?\n\nDid you turn to reputation specialists? If yes, how did you choose them and what did you look for?\n\nWhat ended up working and how much time/resources did it require?\n\nThanks in advance for any response.

Look, before you throw money at any of these companies claiming they can fix this, you need to actually verify these are fake reviews and not just pissed off customers. Document everything - timestamps, review patterns, identical language, accounts with no other activity. Then escalate with Google through their business support, not the regular report button, and be persistent as hell. If they're genuinely fake and you can prove a pattern, sometimes media attention works better than any service - local news loves this kind of story. As for those blockchain reputation whatever companies you mentioned, that sounds like buzzword soup designed to separate you from your money. Most legit reputation management is just good SEO, getting more real reviews to bury the bad ones, and legal cease and desists if you can actually prove defamation. Don't panic spend on some expensive service until you've exhausted the free options and talked to a lawyer about your actual legal options.",

This most likely included items such as recipes, suppliers, business processes, and je ne sais quoi.\n\nI've seen many restaurant owners fail, yet those four succeeded because, in their minds, they weren't starting from scratch; they were reclaiming their previous victory.\n\nThis gave me an idea. You've probably heard about Manifestation. The type of Manifestation I think most credible is through In-Depth Acting. i.e., Act as if your desire had already been achieved. It does two things:\n\n1. It implants a muscle memory into your subconscious\n2. It gets your subconscious comfortable with the new environment and overwrites old habits\n\nThe hardest part of the journey is getting your hands on a detailed playbook that lets you act as if you already own the desired goal that you want to manifest.\n\nEvery day, act as if you already own and operate that successful business. From doing fake marketing to fake sales calls. Managing a fake team, etc.\n\nDon't think of it as \"faking it\" or \"manifestation,\" think of it as practice. Practice has a better ring to it because it suggests you're getting better at it. You practice a musical instrument or sport and get better.\n\nPractice would also outperform reading a book, watching a video, or taking a course, just as playing golf would outperform reading about playing golf.\n\nWhat do you think?",

I think it's partly to get the comfort of hearing about other people doing the same thing, and partly because I want to also be challenged and hence be able to prepare myself better for what's coming.\n\nIn March, I'll be leaving my 72K€/year job (in Spain) as a Product Manager to travel the world with my girlfriend and use a lot of the time to build products myself. I'm 28 years old and really like my job, I really do. At the same time, during the last months I have built a couple of products that get around 150 visits per month (no paid users yet), and it has been really eye-opening on how much I love doing this. I can't stop imagining myself doing this for a living. It's been hard to juggle between a demanding full-time job, social life, and building these products. I feel that if I had more mental capacity to focus on this, I could really make it.\n\nAt the same time, my girlfriend is up to traveling the world and I feel like it's now or never (I have no kids, no debts, no attachments).\n\nI have cash runway for 2–3 years, but my plan is to do this for a year, explore building products more seriously, and discover if I really want to do this full-time. Worst case, I come back to my job or find a new one (I have confidence I can find another one easily).\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share my experience and see if it resonates with someone. Any tips, challenges, will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you and happy building!",

It started as frustration.\n\nWhen my son was born, I tried multiple sleep training methods and courses. Some were too rigid, others too generic, and most relied on “trust the process” without giving parents a real way to understand what was working.\n\nSo I decided to approach the problem differently.\n\nTogether with my sister (a midwife) and a small group of pediatricians and sleep consultants she collaborates with, I developed **PAT Sleep System** — a structured sleep training framework based on experimentation and measurement rather than a single fixed method.\n\nThe core principles:\n\t•\tno one-size-fits-all formula\n\t•\tparents test different approaches\n\t•\tresults are tracked with clear metrics\n\t•\tdecisions are driven by data\n\nThe program runs over 14 days and focuses on teaching babies how to fall asleep independently.\n\nEarly results\n\nWe launched recently, and the first outcomes are honestly very encouraging.\nBabies around 7–8 months are reaching 10–12 hours of uninterrupted night sleep.\n\nAt this stage, I’m less focused on scaling and more on refinement.\n\nWhat I’m working on now\n\t•\timproving the educational materials\n\t•\tsimplifying the framework without losing rigor\n\t•\tcollecting structured feedback from parents\n\t•\tvalidating messaging and positioning\n\nThis is the project if you’re curious it is called The Cozy Knights.\n\nI’m posting here to keep myself accountable and to learn from others who’ve built education or parenting-related businesses.\n\nIf you’ve launched:\n\t•\tdigital courses\n\t•\tevidence-based products\n\t•\tor anything in the parenting space\n\nI’d love to hear what worked (and what didn’t) in your early stages.\n\nI’ll update as things evolve.",

      "text": "I've been working for a few months now on a one-page website builder that creates uniquely designed websites for small businesses with a strong focus on three areas: conversion, good SEO principles and ease of going live. I think the product solidly delivers on all of these.\n\nFrom here on I figured outreach would be the big one right, and I feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing, and keep iterating the product based on feedback I'm getting, trying to reach people for who the product would actually be useful. I feel my issue is that it is hard to actually reach my users. I think, at least initially I should be doing it in person, but right now I'm based in the country of Georgia, where most small businesses have no interest in a website. In my home country in Belgium, it seems like businesses want to have a website, but even the easy fast do it yourself option feels too much work for most of them, so I'm having more success selling the sites all-in for a fixed price. But this also feels off, because I'm basically asking them the input manually and than still use my own tool to make the site for them, so it's hard to price it \"right\" if that makes sense?\n\nI'm now doing cold out reach through Instagram / Messenger / WhatsApp DMs to SMB owners I find on Google Maps that do not have a website yet mainly (I'm also thinking of reaching out to those who already have a website, but a bad / outdated one). The highest reply rate by far is \"Hey, I had a question, do you mind if I ask?\" <- then proceed to ask them about why they don't have a website yet (but this feels like \"tricking\" them, which I don't like). Other outreach approaches seem to have a very low reply rate (I tried short / long / introducing me in detail / not doing that / reaching out with the a free preview offer and than having the option for them to continue building it / have an offer to do it all-in and handle everything for them (of course at a higher price point). But all of those seem to have a very very low reply rate (like less than 5%).\n\nSo I'm wondering looking at competitors like Wix, Squarespace, Durable who have all been able to scale to millions of users, why it's so hard for me to find even one paying user for a product a feel addresses quite a few of the pain points that SMB owners are talking about when using those services. What am I doing wrong? How do you think I should find users for what I have build? Should I just focus on doing the all-in websites (at least initially) as those pay the bills?",

Especially smb owners.\n\nWhen someone pays more specifically to not be involved, that tells you something.   \nThey’re not really buying a website, they are buying relief from having to think about websites at all.\n\nThat doesn’t mean your tool or initial idea is wrong. It may just mean the first buyer isn’t the DIY user you imagined, but someone who wants the outcome without the cognitive overhead. a lot of successful software products started as services for exactly this reason.\n\nIt might help to stop asking why won’t they use the tool and instead ask who actually wants this problem off their plate, and when. Those are very different buyers.\n\nIf you zoom out for a moment, do you want the next phase to buy you validation that the tool works, or clarity about who truly wants to own this problem themselves?",

That's not a marketing problem, that's market feedback telling you what they actually value.\n\nThe small businesses you're targeting don't want another tool to learn. They want the website to exist without them thinking about it. Wix and Squarespace scaled with tens of millions in marketing spend and years of brand building, comparing yourself to them is pointless. They also target a different user, someone who actually wants to build their own site.\n\nThe \"tricking\" feeling about your opener is misplaced. Asking someone why they don't have a website isn't manipulation, it's genuine curiosity about their situation. That's just sales.\n\nWith our clients doing productized services the ones who succeed fastest stop fighting what customers are buying. If done-for-you at a fixed price is closing, do that. Price it based on the value of a working website to them, not based on how long it takes you. If your tool lets you build sites in 2 hours that would take someone else 10 hours, that efficiency is your margin.\n\nRun the productized service for 6-12 months, learn what these customers actually need, then decide if the DIY tool still makes sense.

Also want to be clear, that I do see SMBs wanting a website done for them, they're even willing to pay me a fixed price to do it for them of 1000 USD + 20 USD p.m. (even if they could literally do it themselves using the tool for 20 USD p.m. without the fixed fee in about 20 minutes,  maybe 1 hour with usual required changes).\n\nI’m not surprised the market for website builders is crowded at all, and I’m not expecting a \"fair share\" for showing up.

You can file an LLC online in under an hour for less than $200 in most states. Every guru on YouTube and TikTok is selling courses on \"how to start your business TODAY\" and it's never been easier to become official.\n\nBut formation is maybe 5% of the actual administrative work.\n\nWhat comes after is this ongoing maze of compliance requirements that most first-time business owners have zero awareness of. Annual reports. Biennial statements. Franchise taxes. BOI filings. Business licenses at city, county, and state levels. Registered agent requirements. Good standing certificates.\n\nAnd here's the kicker - the penalties for missing these aren't proportional to the complexity. A $50 annual report you didn't know existed can result in dissolution of your business. Your LLC status can go from \"active\" to \"delinquent\" while you're busy actually running the company and generating revenue.\n\nI've seen people lose contracts because they couldn't produce a certificate of good standing on demand. I know someone who had their business involuntarily dissolved because compliance notices went to an old address.\n\nThe infrastructure exists to help with this - InCorp as registered agent to handle the ongoing compliance tracking - but most new business owners don't even know this is something they should be budgeting for until they've already missed something critical.\n\nWhy isn't this part of the conversation? Why do we celebrate making formation easy but completely ignore the fact that we're setting people up to fail on the backend?\n\nThoughts?",

One page with: exact legal name, state ID number, registered agent, tax year, deadlines for annual report/franchise tax/BOI, plus links to the state SOS search and local licensing portals. Then:\n1) Put every deadline in a shared calendar with 60/30/7-day reminders.\n2) Use a service that actually explains your obligations in plain English (Northwest for RA, Stripe Atlas for Delaware + early-stage, and doola for non-US founders who need EIN/banking/compliance guardrails instead of just one-off filings).\n3) Once a quarter, spend 30 minutes doing a “good standing” check: state site, RA messages, IRS letters.\nThe main point is compliance should be treated like payroll: invisible, scheduled, and never a surprise.",

But this is the stuff that actually matters and can literally destroy your business even when you're doing everything right in terms of building the product and getting customers and making money.\n\nLike why isn't there more transparency about this stuff from the beginning. Why don't they tell you when you're filing your LLC that you're gonna need a registered agent and you're gonna have annual reports and franchise taxes and all these other requirements that you need to track and manage. It should be part of the same conversation but it's not and that's why so many businesses fail not because the business idea was bad or the founder wasn't working hard but because they missed some random compliance thing that they didn't even know they had to do.",

Don’t “overinvest” in yourself, you should have the mentality that most expenses are based on scams unless they are returnable tools or things that produce immediate, safe turnaround. Don’t buy courses — if you do this, you probably have way too much to learn about real life first before starting a business and should hyperfocus on getting some street smarts. Last, never work with partners unless you take the time to understand how a corporate structure works — ie. how taxes, private loans, payouts, and salaries are different than ownership % and dividends. If you don’t understand this concept, you have NO business trying to run a business with someone else who owns even 1%",

I’m technically solid: servers, hosting, networking. As a hobby i started web development (Frontend + Backend), built a lot of pages and apps (more fun than business). \n\nBuilding and running things isn’t the issue for me. I want to get out of employment and move toward self-employment. Not because I’m chasing some magic business model or overnight success. I know that doesn’t exist.\n\nBoth of my parents were entrepreneurs as well (different industry, not for me), so I grew up around that mindset. I’m not afraid of hard work, long hours, or slow progress. I just want to build something of my own that actually makes sense.\n\nWhat I’m really after is learning how to identify real niches and real customer problems, and then build products or services that solve those problems and people are willing to pay for. Not once, but repeatedly.\n\nMy current thinking: Focus first on marketing and understanding demand\n\n→ learn how people think, decide, and buy\n→ then build the right product on top of that\n\nNot the other way around.\n\nI’m starting to seriously study marketing and neuromarketing because I want to understand the mechanics, not just copy tactics. I genuinely enjoy these topics and want to develop the skillset to independently find problems, validate them, and build solutions.\n\nSo my questions:\nDoes this order of learning and execution make sense?\nWhat parts of marketing matter most early on for solo founders?\nWhere do technical people like me usually mess this up?\n\nI’m not looking for shortcuts or hype. I’m looking for honest experiences and lessons learned.\n\nAppreciate any input. 🙏",

Your approach totally makes sense: learn what people need first to build solutions second. Most tech founders do the opposite and waste months building something nobody really wants. If you’re starting solo, here’s what I’d focus on early: Talk to people / validate pain points – literally watch them struggle and see if they’d actually pay for a fix. Make your value super clear – can you explain in one sentence why someone should care? If not, hold off building. Run tiny tests – landing pages, surveys, pre-orders, small ad experiments. Quick feedback more important building the full thing. Figure out where your audience hangs out – forums, Discord, Reddit, LinkedIn and test messaging there. Tech people often slip up by overbuilding, adding stuff no one asked for, focusing on nice-to-have instead of must-have, or forgetting that even the best solution fails if it’s hard to find or buy. \n\nHonestly, if you combine your technical skills with really understanding what people want and quick experiments, you’ll avoid most rookie mistakes. What kind of problem or niche are you most interested in exploring first? That’ll help you figure out which marketing pieces to learn first.",

On top of that, you can now get a higher wage as someone with 2 years experience than you could with 0 years. Changing companies is a huge salary jump. \n\nI don't understand why this is so hard for HR to grasp. Proactively bring your employees salaries to be competitive with their increased experience and inflation or you will end up eating the price of employee churn.",

          "text": "This is actually a smart reset, not a downgrade you’re removing ego, sunk-cost bias, and burnout from the equation. A few high-leverage thoughts that might help you get real signal faster with this approach: First, free is fine only if you’re testing the right thing. Page views vs downloads tells you interest, but it doesn’t tell you value. One simple tweak that keeps things lightweight: ask for a tiny commitment before download. Even something like “enter an email to get updates / next version” or a “pay what you want (including $0)” option. People who bother are already a different class of signal. Second, static/offline tools are perfect for sharp, single-pain use cases. The ones that tend to spread are not “productivity tools” but “I built this because I was annoyed by X.” When you post, lead with the irritation, not the tool. People don’t share tools, they share relief. Third, usage more important then downloads is the real boss metric, but it’s invisible unless you design for it. Since you’re offline/no backend, consider baking in something like: a visible “session count” the user sees themselves or a very obvious “did this help?” prompt with a one-click feedback link. It sounds small, but it turns passive users into active signal. Fourth, Gumroad is not just a checkout, it’s a filter. Even when you switch to paid, pricing at $3–$7 will tell you more than free ever will. If someone won’t pay the price of a coffee to remove a real annoyance, the problem probably isn’t strong enough. Two questions that’ll help sharpen the next iteration: What specific moment or frustration made you build this tool for yourself? If this tool disappeared tomorrow, what would you personally be most annoyed to lose? Those answers usually point directly to the version people will actually use and pay for.",

          "text": "You picked my interest and I looked at your posting history to try to guess the problem.\n\nYou developed an iOS app that reminds people to go out for light, if I'm not mistaken. You posted about this application on various subreddits, in a somewhat thoughtful manner, properly, and in a large-enough quantity.\n\nThere is nothing crucially wrong, but I see a few points that may explain lack of success:\n\n1. iOS is only 30% of the devices (depends on where in the world), and Redditors are not big Apple fans. So you remove 70% of the population by not having, or advertising, an Android app.\n\n2. You posted in quite frugal subreddits. Subreddits about tech-free life, minimal living, nature, etc. These people really don't care or want yet another app on their phone. And would most probably not own an Apple phone. You can try to post in r/tech or r/programming or things like that: tech-savvy people, always indoors, always on their phones, getting disconnected from the natural cycles and in dire need of some sun exposure.\n\n3. The app itself has only marginal utility. It is a timer, if I understand well. Good points are that this is a \"no-bullshit\" app, with no account nor anything. But it also does so little! Why would someone take the time to stop what they are doing, go to the App store, find your app, click on Install, wait for it to install, then open it? People willing to do so must already be in the \"I need to be reminded to go out\" mood. You have to find the right people and the right time.\n\nSo, I would suggest that you make sure that your AppStore SEO is good (e.g. someone looking for \"sun\" or related things finds your app), and then maybe try some discreet promotion in subreddits about reducing LED blue light (from screens), tech, sysadmins, etc. People will notice that they have a need for your app, will search for it, find it, and install it.\n\nSo, finding people who have the problem you solve. Not trying to advertise your solution to people who already solved the problem (outdoory people).",

          "text": "The Reddit algorithm for getting responses is pretty simple: be a real person in the community first. Post history matters. If someone clicks your profile and sees nothing but launch posts and feedback requests across ten subreddits, they scroll past. If they see months of genuine comments helping other people, they're way more likely to engage.\n\nThe posts that get responses usually have a specific question, not \"what do you think of my idea\" but \"I tried X approach and got Y result, what am I missing.\" Specificity invites expertise. Vague asks get vague silence.\n\nOur clients who've gotten useful Reddit feedback usually spend two to three weeks commenting genuinely in their target subreddits before ever posting about their own thing. Not strategic comments designed to build credibility, just actually being helpful when they know something. That context makes the eventual ask feel like a community member looking for help rather than a drive-by promotion.\n\nThe words that kill engagement: \"launching soon,\" \"would love feedback,\" \"check out what I built,\" anything that sounds like a press release. The words that work: \"I'm stuck on,\" \"this flopped and I don't understand why,\" \"what would you do differently.\" Vulnerability and specificity beat polish.\n\nAlso matters which subreddit. Some are brutal about self-promo, others are specifically for feedback. Reading the room and the rules before posting saves wasted effort.",

When the audience isn’t clearly defined, people don’t recognize themselves in the problem, so they scroll.\n\nA better move early is to get very clear on your ideal customer profile and talk to those people directly, one by one. Reach out to them where they already are, have real conversations, and focus on validating the problem first (what resonates, what doesn’t, what language they use) before worrying too much about feedback on the product itself.\n\nOnce you’ve nailed that, posting on Reddit gets easier because the message is sharper and more specific. \n\nLike YC always preaches, \"do things that don't scale\"",

      "text": "Hey, I went into SaaS last year with my tool Brandled (helps founders grow on X & LinkedIn) in a pretty competitive space with $0 and 0 audience and ended up wasting six months straight on the wrong things.\n\n\n\nSpent half a year stuck at $0 MRR before I figured out what actually matters.\n\n\n\nHere's everything I learned the hard way. Wish someone had told me this on day one.\n\n\n\n1. Offer Google/social login. Seriously.\n\n\n\nI started with the magic link only. (cause i adopted ship fast mentality on the wrong things)\n\n\n\nMy signup completion rate was 45%.\n\n\n\nAdded Google OAuth. It jumped to 78% overnight.\n\n\n\nFriction at signup is invisible revenue loss. Every extra step costs you 20-30% of potential users.\n\n\n\nTakes like 1 hour to implement. \n\n\n\n2. Post-launch is 80% marketing, 20% product. Maybe even 90/10.\n\n\n\nI spent 3 months building features.\n\n\n\nThen I \"launched.\"\n\n\n\nGot 12 signups. 0 paying customer.\n\n\n\nI thought: \"The product isn't good enough yet. Let me add more features.\"\n\n\n\nSpent another week building.\n\n\n\nBut still got no results.\n\n\n\nThe problem wasn't my product. The problem was nobody knew it existed.\n\n\n\nHere's the truth: your product only needs to solve ONE problem well. That's it. Everything else is marketing.\n\n\n\nI know founders with worse products than mine making $50k MRR because they're good at marketing.\n\n\n\nI know founders with better products than mine making $0 because they suck at marketing.\n\n\n\nPost-launch, you should spend 80% of your time getting eyeballs on your product and 20% improving it based on paying customer feedback.\n\n\n\nNot the other way around.\n\n\n\n3. Market shamelessly. Talk about your product everywhere.\n\n\n\nI was terrified of being \"salesy.\"\n\n\n\nSo I'd post about \"building in public\" but never actually mention my product.\n\n\n\nI'd write valuable content on Reddit but never link to my tool.\n\n\n\nSo I was staring $0 MRR every day.\n\n\n\nThen I started being shameless and mentioning my product everywhere.\n\n\n\nNobody will discover your product by accident. You have to put it in their face. Repeatedly.\n\n\n\nThe people who get offended by promotion weren't going to buy anyway.\n\n\n\n4. Respect the ones who churn. They're giving you honest feedback.\n\n\n\nWhen users churn, I used to feel rejected.\n\n\n\nNow I have an automated email that asks: \"What made you unsubscribe?\"\n\n\n\nThe responses are gold.\n\n\n\nA lot of times, I was able to get them back by just guiding them or fixing some minor issue in the tool.\n\n\n\n5. Use your own product every single day. Not once a week. Every. Day.\n\n\n\nI built Brandled but wasn't using it consistently for my own content.\n\n\n\nOne day I forced myself to use it like a real user would.\n\n\n\nFound 7 bugs in 30 minutes. Things I never noticed in testing.\n\n\n\nMy users were experiencing all of this and not telling me. They were just leaving.\n\n\n\nNow I use Brandled for everything.\n\n\n\nI catch problems before my users do. And I understand their workflow because I live it.\n\n\n\nIf you're not using your own product daily, you're building blind.\n\n\n\n6. Retention > acquisition.\n\n\n\nI was obsessed with getting new signups.\n\n\n\nRan ads. Did outreach. Posted everywhere.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, my churn rate was 40% per month.\n\n\n\nI'd get 10 new customers and lose 4 old ones.\n\n\n\nNet growth: 6.\n\n\n\nI was filling a leaky bucket.\n\n\n\nThen I focused on retention:\n\n\n\nFixed onboarding\n\n\n\nAdded email sequences to keep users engaged\n\n\n\nBuilt features existing customers actually asked for\n\n\n\nChecked in with users who went quiet\n\n\n\nChurn dropped to 15%.\n\n\n\nNow when I get 10 new customers, I only lose 2-3.\n\n\n\nNet growth: 7-8.\n\n\n\nSame marketing effort, but better results.\n\n\n\n7. Your MVP should only have the must-haves. Actually stick to MoSCoW.\n\n\n\nI know everyone says this. But I didn't listen.\n\n\n\nMy \"MVP\" had:\n\n\n\nContent generation\n\n\n\nAnalytics dashboard\n\n\n\nPost scheduling\n\n\n\nCompetitor tracking\n\n\n\nSWOT analysis\n\n\n\nComment assistant\n\n\n\nHashtag research\n\n\n\nThat's not an MVP.\n\n\n\nI should've launched with ONE feature: AI content generation that sounds like you.\n\n\n\nThat's it.\n\n\n\nEverything else should've come after people paid for that one thing.\n\n\n\nHere's how MoSCoW actually works:\n\n\n\nMust have: The ONE thing that solves the core problem\n\n\n\nShould have: Stuff you add after the first 10 paying customers ask for it\n\n\n\nCould have: Nice-to-haves that you build if you have extra time (you won't)\n\n\n\nWon't have: Everything else (most of your ideas belong here)\n\n\n\nYour MVP should make people go \"holy shit, this solves my problem\" even if it's ugly and missing features.\n\n\n\nNot \"wow, this has so many features\" while not solving anything particularly well.\n\n\n\n8. Price based on value, not competition.\n\n\n\nI looked at my competitors:\n\n\n\nTaplio: $39/month\n\n\n\nSuperX: $29/month\n\n\n\nHypefury: $29/month\n\n\n\nI priced Brandled at $19/month to \"undercut the market.\"\n\n\n\nBig mistake.\n\n\n\nLow price signals low value. People assumed I was inferior.\n\n\n\nPlus, at $19/month, I needed 263 customers to hit $5k MRR.\n\n\n\nAt $39/month, I need 128.\n\n\n\nHalf the customers for the same revenue.\n\n\n\nThen I realized: my tool saves people 10+ hours per week. That's worth $500-$700/month atleast for most founders.\n\n\n\nI wasn't competing on price. I was competing on value.\n\n\n\nRaised my price to $29/month - $39/month. Conversions actually IMPROVED.\n\n\n\nBecause the people who care about $10 differences aren't your best customers anyway.\n\n\n\nYour best customers care about results, not price.\n\n\n\nPrice for the value you deliver, not for what your competitors charge.\n\n\n\nThe Truth Most SaaS Founders Don't Want to Hear:\n\n\n\nMost SaaS founders don't fail because of bad ideas.\n\n\n\nThey fail because they give up too early.\n\n\n\n90% of SaaS products are gone within 2 years.\n\n\n\nNot because they couldn't work.\n\n\n\nBecause the founder quit before they figured out what works.\n\n\n\nI almost quit at month 5. I was depressed. Burnt out. Convinced I was wasting my time.\n\n\n\nThen I changed my approach and hit $126 MRR in 4 days.\n\n\n\nStill small. But it's proof the model works.\n\n\n\nNow it's just about staying consistent and not quitting when shit gets hard (which it will).\n\n\n\nHere's my commitment:\n\n\n\nI'm building this to $10k MRR minimum. No matter how long it takes.\n\n\n\nI'm documenting everything on X and LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nNot the highlight reel. The real shit. The mistakes. The failures. The small wins.\n\n\n\nIf you're building something, my advice: stay in the game.\n\n\n\nMost people quit right before things start working.\n\n\n\nDon't be most people.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions or share more details on any of this.",

You fix onboarding, tweak pricing, change positioning, then six months later you’re questioning everything again. Keeping that reasoning around matters. I’ve started being more intentional about capturing context, not just metrics. Notion helps, but I’ve also used Sensay as a low effort way to preserve those lessons so I don’t relearn them every cycle.\n\nRespect for sticking it out and being honest about the ugly parts.

      "text": "I've been running email and SMS campaigns for ecommerce brands for about a decade now, and 2025 was one of the most interesting years yet.\n\nI worked with about 40 brands this year doing anywhere from $50k to $3M+ annually. Some crushed it. Some struggled. A few went out of business.\n\nHere's what I learned from being inside the backend of all these stores. And what I'm changing in 2026 because of it.\n\nThe Brands That Won Owned Their Audience\n\nThe stores that scaled in 2025 weren't the ones with the best ads. They were the ones that built communities and owned their traffic.\n\nI had a pet brand do $2.5 million in a year after they stopped running ads entirely. How? We built a subreddit, grew it to 20k members, and turned that community into an email list that did 60% of their revenue.\n\nAnother client was a personal trainer who went from $10k to $40k per month by building a Reddit community in his niche. He now books 5 to 10 discovery calls per week just from the engagement in his subreddit.\n\nThe pattern is clear. Brands that rely on rented attention (Meta ads, TikTok, Google) are getting squeezed. CPMs are up. Conversions are down. The ones winning are building owned channels like email lists, SMS lists, Discord servers, Facebook groups, and Reddit communities.\n\nIf your entire business depends on paid ads, 2026 is going to hurt. Start building something you own.\n\n2. Personalization Actually Matters Now\n\nEveryone talks about personalization, but most brands are still sending the same email to everyone.\n\nThis year I started segmenting lists harder than ever. We split buyers by purchase frequency, location, product category, and engagement level.\n\nHere's one example. For a free shipping campaign, instead of sending one email to everyone, we sent three versions:\n\nOne to first time buyers: \"Thanks for your last order. Here's free shipping to try something new.\"\n\nOne to VIPs (2+ purchases): \"Exclusive sale just for you\" with a slightly better offer.\n\nOne to non buyers: \"Now's the best time to try us. No shipping fees.\"\n\nThe result? Open rates went up. Revenue went up. Unsubscribes went down.\n\nEven small things like using the customer's city in the subject line made a difference. \"We're doing free shipping for customers in {{Customers\\_City}}\" consistently doubled open rates compared to generic subject lines.\n\nMost brands have the data to do this. They just don't use it. In 2026, I'm pushing every client to segment harder and personalize more.\n\n3. AI Made Things Faster But Not Better\n\nEvery brand I worked with this year asked me about AI tools for email marketing.\n\nI tested a bunch of them. AI can write decent subject lines, generate email copy, and automate some workflows. It saves time. But it also makes everything sound the same.\n\nThe brands that performed best weren't the ones using AI for everything. They were the ones using AI to speed up grunt work but keeping the human touch in their messaging.\n\nAI can draft an email. But it can't write a founder's personal story. It can't capture the tone of a brand that actually connects with people. And it definitely can't build community.\n\nIn 2026, I'm using AI more for research, data analysis, and automations. But I'm keeping humans in charge of the actual writing and strategy.\n\n4. BFCM Proved That Preparation Beats Discounts\n\nBlack Friday this year separated the prepared from the desperate.\n\nThe brands that planned ahead, segmented their lists, and built anticipation for weeks crushed it. The brands that just sent \"30% off\" emails got mediocre results.\n\nOne thing that worked really well this year was adding a persistent offer banner to every email during BFCM. Even automated flows like welcome sequences and post purchase emails had the sale at the top.\n\nAnother tactic that always works: resending high performing campaigns with new subject lines. Same email. Same list. Different hook. It added 25 to 50% more revenue every time.\n\nThe brands that treated BFCM like a one day event lost. The brands that treated it like a two week campaign with multiple touchpoints won.\n\nIn 2026, I'm starting BFCM planning in September. Not November.\n\n5. Most Brands Are Ignoring Their Best Customers\n\nThis one surprised me. A lot of brands are so focused on new customer acquisition that they forget about the people who already bought from them.\n\nYour best customers are the ones who already trust you. They convert faster. They spend more. They refer people. And most brands barely talk to them.\n\nThis year I started building VIP segments for every client. People who've purchased 2+ times get different treatment. Early access to sales. Exclusive offers. Personal thank you emails.\n\nOne brand sent a plain text thank you email after BFCM with no pitch, no sale, just gratitude. It was the highest revenue email they sent all year. People responded saying they appreciated being treated like a person, not a wallet.\n\nIn 2026, I'm pushing every brand to build better retention systems for existing customers. New customers are expensive. Repeat customers are profit.\n\n6. Community Beats Content Every Time\n\nI spent years telling brands to create more content. Post more on Instagram. Make more TikToks. Send more emails.\n\nBut 2024 taught me something different. Community beats content.\n\nA brand with 500 engaged community members in a Discord or Reddit group will outperform a brand with 50k Instagram followers who don't care.\n\nThe reason? Community creates loyalty. It turns customers into advocates. It gives you direct feedback. It makes people feel like they're part of something.\n\nOne of my clients built a Facebook group for their niche. It's now 10k members. Those members generate user content, answer each other's questions, and defend the brand when someone complains. That's worth more than any ad campaign.\n\nIn 2026, I'm helping every client build or grow a community. Reddit, Discord, Facebook groups, whatever fits. But community first, content second.\n\n7. The Backend Is Where the Real Money Is\n\nMost brands obsess over their homepage, their product pages, and their ads. And yeah, those matter.\n\nBut the brands that made the most money this year were the ones that optimized their backend. Email flows, post purchase sequences, win back campaigns, and retention systems.\n\nI've seen brands flip from 20% email revenue to 60% email revenue just by building proper welcome flows, abandoned cart sequences, and post purchase nurtures.\n\nOne client was doing $100k per month with 80% of sales coming from ads. After we rebuilt their email system, they're now doing $150k per month with 60% coming from email and retention. Their ad spend went down. Their profit went up.\n\nThe lesson? Your backend is your profit center. Optimize it first.\n\nIn 2026, I'm spending less time on growth hacks and more time on backend systems that compound.\n\nWhat I'm Changing in 2026\n\nBased on everything I learned this year, here's what I'm doing differently:\n\nBuilding communities first, ads second. Every client is getting a Reddit or Discord strategy.\n\nSegmenting harder. No more one size fits all emails.\n\nUsing AI for speed, not strategy. Humans write. AI assists.\n\nPlanning BFCM in September. Not scrambling in October.\n\nTreating VIP customers like VIPs. Retention over acquisition.\n\nOptimizing backends first. Growth comes after systems are solid.\n\nIf you're running an ecommerce brand or thinking about starting one, don't chase the shiny stuff in 2026. Build systems that compound. Own your audience. Treat your customers like people.\n\nThat's what worked in 2025. And that's what's going to work even better in 2026.",

I work a retail job next to school and make around 600–700€ a month.\n\nSince I was like 13–14 I’ve been obsessed with the idea of building something on my own. Not just money, but having a project, something I can work on every day and slowly grow over time.\n\nThe problem is: I have no idea what that should be.\n\nI tried some stuff. Clothing reselling, different jobs since I was 15. I even had phases where I made decent money. But when I look back now, I feel stupid seeing that only around 300€ are left. I did pay my driver’s license, vacations, daily stuff etc., so it’s not like I wasted everything — still feels bad for the amount of work.\n\nEverything I look at now feels oversaturated. Social media, ecom, agencies, all that. Nothing really clicks. I don’t even know my real strengths. I’m pretty insecure about that tbh.\n\nI try to improve myself, read, work, think long term. My biggest problem is probably phone addiction and distraction. I’m working on it, but yeah.\n\nI also compare myself a lot to people online who seem to “have it figured out”, which doesn’t help.\n\nI don’t want to jump from hype to hype or waste the next years trying random things with no direction.\n\nSo my question is:\n\nHow did you find the right business or direction for yourself?

      "text": "I launched my ecommerce store about 8 months ago, and while things are going decent. Hit $15k MRR last month, finally feeling like this thing might actually work. But I can't sleep, and it's not because of inventory issues or ad costs. It's reputation anxiety, and it's absolutely consuming me.\n\nBut this keeps me up, I've watched legitimate brands get nuked overnight by a single hit piece. Doesn't matter if the allegations are proven false later-the damage is done. Google indexes it, people screenshot everything, and suddenly your brand name is permanently tied to controversy. Conversion rates tank, wholesale deals evaporate, and you're stuck defending yourself instead of growing.\n\nIt's wild how fragile this whole thing is. You can spend years building trust, perfecting your product, delivering great customer service-and then one competitor decides they want to play dirty, or some blogger writes a misleading article for clicks, and boom. Your conversion rate tanks, wholesale deals evaporate, and you're stuck trying to convince people that what they read isn't true. The worst thing? The asymmetry. Someone can trash your reputation in 24 hours. Rebuilding takes months or years. In ecommerce, you don't have months-customers just bounce to the next option.\n\nI used to think my buddy (also runs an ecommerce store) was being paranoid when he obsessed over this stuff. He even hired a reputation management firm and I remember thinking \"aren't those PR things just for people who actually screwed up?\" But now I'm feeling that same. I never considered that competitors could intentionally sabotage you just to take market share.\n\nRight now I'm doing the basics like maintaining SEO, working with a small influencer who does honest reviews. But it feels like I'm building a sandcastle next to the ocean. One big wave and it's over.\n\nSo I guess my question to everyone here. How are you actually protecting your reputation proactively? Not just reacting when something bad happens, but actually building defenses before the hit comes?\n\nAre you working with PR firms? Monitoring brand mentions 24/7? Or am I just being paranoid and overthinking this? Or just accepting this as part of the game?\n\nBecause right now, this anxiety is affecting how I run my business. I second-guess every decision wondering \"could this blow up publicly?\" and it's exhausting.\n\nAnyone else dealing with this?",

          "text": "The anxiety you're describing sounds disproportionate to your actual risk level. At $15k MRR you're not big enough to attract coordinated attacks from competitors or journalists looking for controversy. Most ecommerce drama happens to brands at much larger scale or ones that genuinely screw up.\n\nThe nightmare scenarios you're imagining, competitor hit pieces, viral false allegations, are real but rare. The brands that get \"nuked overnight\" usually had actual problems that surfaced, not fabricated attacks. Our clients running ecommerce at your scale almost never face reputation crises beyond the occasional bad review or unhappy customer post.\n\nPractical stuff that actually matters:\n\nGoogle yourself and your brand weekly. Set up free Google Alerts. If something weird appears you want to know fast.\n\nKeep building positive content that ranks. Your own blog, earned media, customer reviews on multiple platforms. The more legitimate content exists, the harder it is for one negative piece to dominate search results.\n\nScreenshot and document everything. Customer communications, fulfillment records, product quality. If something does go sideways, having receipts matters.\n\nRespond to negative reviews professionally and publicly. Most reputation damage comes from how brands react, not the original complaint.\n\nThe reputation management firms your buddy hired are mostly selling peace of mind to anxious founders, not actual protection. For a business your size it's almost certainly wasted money.\n\nThe deeper issue is this anxiety is affecting your decision-making and sleep. That's not a business problem, that's a mental health problem wearing a business costume. Might be worth talking to someone about the catastrophic thinking pattern, because this level of fear will hold you back more than any hypothetical hit piece.",

Most indie founders chase “how to grow on X” and forget that “Brandled vs X” traffic is like someone walking into the store with cash in hand. If you haven’t already, add comparison tables, your own data (screenshots, timelines), and a clear “who this is for / who this is not for” on those pages. That filters out bad fits and makes the yes easier.\n\nOn Reddit, one solid post a day is the right move. I’ve seen people mix this with simple tracking in something like Notion + a basic alert stack (Talkwalker, Mention, and Pulse for Reddit) to catch new niche threads and jump in early with useful replies instead of blasting links.\n\nYour real edge now is keeping that “no lying to myself” mindset while you double down on what’s obviously working.",

      "text": "Implementing EOS (the Entrepreneurial Operating System) has been the single best decision for our company’s growth. For those unfamiliar, EOS is a framework that helps small to mid-sized businesses get everyone on the same page by focusing on six key areas: Vision, People, Data, Issues, Process, and Traction. It turns the chaos of a growing company into a predictable, manageable system.\n\nWe’re now 24 months in, and while finding our rhythm took some time, the results have been incredible. Here are the top lessons that actually made a difference for us:\n\n1. Keep your scorecard simple. We started with 40+ metrics, too much noise. Focus on 5–15 leading indicators. If you can’t tell the business’s health in 30 seconds, you’re tracking too much.\n\n2. L10 meetings are for solving, not reporting. Flip your agenda: scorecards and rocks are “on track/off track,” then spend the bulk of time on IDS (Identify, Discuss, Solve).\n\n3. Prioritize leading over lagging indicators. Track the activities that drive results, like calls made or quotes sent, to fix problems before they hit your monthly numbers.\n\n4. Build your Accountability Chart around functions, not people. Define the roles the business needs, then match people who have the GWC (Get it, Want it, Capacity).\n\n5. Roll out EOS one level at a time. Start with leadership, then department heads, then the frontline. Slow and steady ensures adoption sticks.\n\n6. Rate your meetings weekly. A simple 1–10 score at the end of L10 meetings keeps them productive and accountability high.\n\n7. Make Core Values real with storytelling. Don’t just list words on a wall, share examples of employees living the values.\n\n8. Don’t skip “Good News.” Sharing personal wins builds trust and human connection before tackling tough IDS discussions.\n\n9. Move off spreadsheets ASAP. Google Sheets created friction. A dedicated hub feels professional, automated, and keeps adoption high.\n\n10. Pick the right tools. Ninety stays true to the Traction book; Bloom Growth is great for complex needs; monsterops offers a flat-fee, unlimited seats model with solid support.\n\nIf you’re on the fence about starting EOS, dive in. It takes discipline at first, but once the “meeting pulse” becomes part of your culture, you’ll wonder how you ever ran your business without it.\n\nI’m happy to help anyone just getting started or struggling with implementation. Questions about scorecards, people issues, or tools? Drop a comment and I’ll share what worked for us.",

They start with ambiguity.\n\nHere are the patterns I kept noticing.\n\nWork begins before money is actually locked.  \nIt’s framed as “just to get started” or “we’ll settle payment after a quick sample.” Once work starts, leverage quietly disappears.\n\nPayment methods allow one side to reverse decisions.  \nChargebacks or vague buyer protection mean delivery doesn’t actually guarantee payment.\n\nScope creeps in through conversation.  \n“What do you think about…” turns into real work without anyone clearly agreeing it’s billable.\n\nThere’s no shared definition of “done.”  \nIf delivery and approval aren’t explicit, payment becomes subjective. That’s where most arguments stall.\n\nAfter seeing this enough times, I changed one rule for myself.\n\nI don’t start work unless funds are locked first and tied to a clearly defined scope. Delivery and approval are explicit. When “done” is clear, payment stops being emotional.\n\nFor recent off-platform work, I started using an escrow style vault setup, the rule is: lock the money to the scope before work starts.\n\nCurious how other founders here handle off-platform work, or if you’ve found better ways to eliminate payment friction entirely.",
