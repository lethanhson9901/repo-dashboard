      "text": "hey everyone.\n\ni'm a high school student from argentina. down here, things are pretty volatile economically, so i realized early on that if i wanted to build a future, i needed to learn skills that worked globally.\n\nlast year, i took harvard's cs50p (free on youtube). i became obsessed with the idea that \"if you do it more than twice, you should script it.\"\n\ni wanted to share the projects i've built in the last few months to test my skills in the real world. maybe this inspires other teenagers to start coding.\n\n\\*\\*1. the \"virtual photographer\" (computer vision)\\*\\*\n\na local clothing brand was spending a fortune on photoshoots. i wrote a pipeline that takes a messy flat-lay photo of a t-shirt on a table, cleans it, and uses ai to put it on a realistic virtual model.\n\n\\*tech:\\* python, comfyui logic, custom upscaling for skin texture.\n\n\\*result:\\* they stopped hiring models.\n\n\\*\\*2. the \"seo watchdog\" (automation)\\*\\*\n\ni realized manual seo tracking is boring and expensive. i built a script that scrapes google search results for specific keywords daily and logs the ranking changes in a simple dashboard, alerting if a competitor moves up.\n\n\\*tech:\\* beautifulsoup, python, telegram api for alerts.\n\n\\*\\*3. the \"lead hunter\" (scraping)\\*\\*\n\ni needed to find local businesses to talk to, so i built a bot that scrapes google maps for specific niches (like \"plumbers in \\[city\\]\"), extracts their emails, and verifies if they are active.\n\n\\*\\*what i learned:\\*\\*\n\nthe code itself isn't the hard part. the hard part is understanding the business problem (like \"photos are expensive\" or \"data entry is boring\") and translating that into logic.\n\ni'm currently diving into 3d engineering automation (rhino/grasshopper) for a new challenge.\n\njust wanted to share my journey so far. if you are young and hesitating to learn python: just start. it literally changes how you see the world.",

My girlfriend keeps asking when things will get easier financially and I don't have an answer  \n  \nI can't figure out what I should've done differently because the contractor and software wasn't optional but watching $235k disappear into business expenses feels wrong Is 20% take home normal or am I stupid?",

It’s their job to know what information should reach you and every other role involved. A good reference would be a Stakholder mapping, this is basically a guide to which stakeholders should know what.\n\nThe only issue is communication and i’m sure if you take my advice this will help you significantly.

With our knowledge of this exact space and a common issue you're facing, it can be a real game changer (especially for agencies as what they see, is how they choose what you're worth up front) and then the extra revenue can allow for faster scaling, and subsequently a faster rise in take home.

Most agencies are going to net anywhere from 15-25% depending on how good of controls you have in place. I would say you should review your costs as there is probably some leakage in there. There may be another point or two in there.\n\nFor the most part though the thing post people don’t talk about are things like taxes and benefits and so on that when you’re an employee you don’t recognize. Also the infrastructure and marketing to drive the business have a cost that a lot of people don’t think about when they are an employee.\n\nAll and all, you’re doing well it just takes time to get where you actually want to be.",

It’s a margin problem, not an intelligence problem.\n\nRevenue is a loud number. Stop talking about it.  Profit is the quiet one that pays your life. EBIT and what not.  And “good ROI” on ads is not profit if fulfillment and tools swell right behind it. That’s why the bank balance looks kinda confused.\n\nIt’s like buying a car off the sticker and ignoring the out-the-door price: **$300k** is the sticker, **$65k** is what you actually drove home with.\n\n20% is decent, but consider, are you building a company, or a pass-through for vendors?\n\nYour friends only hear the headline. Your girlfriend is asking about security. Security comes from boring math, not hustle. A business can look “successful” and still be one bad month away from panic.\n\n“Your margin is my opportunity,” Jeff Bezos said.  \nTranslation: if you don’t defend margin, everyone else will take it.  \nApplication: margin becomes a rule, not a hope.\n\n* **Productize the offer** so delivery is predictable, not a custom puzzle every time.\n* **Cap contractor spend** per unit of work, so costs don’t chase revenue upward.\n* **Cut overhead hard**, including tools and ad spend that demands extra labor, and pay yourself first as real overhead.\n\nAnyway, back to the 20%....  \n  \nIn 2023, Amazon generated approximately $574.8 billion in net sales.  Jeff Bezos net worth increased by a measly 12% of that.  $70B.  So, in reality, you're taking home more than him.",

Receiving that email was one of the best days of my career and a major moment for our company. \n\nIt took about 3-4 weeks to go through diligence and agree on the deal points. It was a Tuesday evening that we finally agreed to everything over a call and I was told that Docusign would be sent the next day and funds wired Friday. \n\nThursday comes and still no Docusign. I email to check in with leadership, and everything seemed on track just delayed with upcoming holidays. \n\nThen Monday arrives with a phone call. When I answer, the venture team asks me to google their company to see a press release. I then come to find out that they had taken a human first position as a company and are not touching AI, which somehow the venture team had no idea…our platform is an AI interactive media platform for superfans to create music, stories, etc inside licensed franchise IP. \n\nMy lesson. Take the damn deal, because it might not be there again in 3 weeks. \n\nNot slowing us down, just changes a few things temporarily. ",

I am now back to searching for a reliable alternative that actually delivers what they promise, since the last site I used didn't really meet my expectations.\n\nI have been creating content on Instagram for a while, and I really enjoy it, but my engagement has slowed down. My posts get views, but likes, comments, and shares are not growing the way I hoped. I decided to buy Instagram followers because even though I post regularly and use hashtags, it still feels like some of my videos go unnoticed.\n\nI spent time reading discussions on Reddit and other platforms to understand how creators improve engagement. A friend also told me that it helped them get more visibility, but the specific site I tried just didn't deliver the quality I needed.\n\nMy goal is to find services that offer real, active profiles that help content get noticed without putting an account at risk. If anyone has experience with buying Instagram followers from a better source that improved engagement, I would really appreciate your advice.\n",

It felt higher-quality than services I’d tried before (I had worse luck with Buzzoid, Twicsy and Stormlikes), but it wasn’t a magic bullet — the followers alone didn’t sustain engagement.\n\n\n\nWhat helped afterward: stagger buys (small, timed boosts), buy likes/comments not just raw follower numbers, laser-target your niche, respond to every comment fast, collab with one microcreator, and run a couple of cheap Reels or story ads to convert visibility into real followers. Also avoid huge overnight spikes — slow and steady looks more organic and lowers risk.",

      "text": "Earlier, whenever I thought I had found a clever or unique idea, it felt exciting but also uncertain. Most of these ideas sounded good in theory but felt fragile in reality. That made me rethink how I evaluate opportunities.\n\nRecently, while exploring StartupIdeas DB which I found on google, I decided to ignore trendy or flashy concepts and focus only on products that already exist and are already generating revenue. Real SaaS products with real customers.\n\nOne idea in their tech category stood out. It was a simple B2B SaaS solving a boring but painful operational problem. No hype, no complex positioning. Just a clear solution people were willing to pay for.\n\nI will not share the exact idea publicly, but there are many similar examples available.\n\nOnce a product is making money, the question of whether the idea is valid is mostly answered. The problem is real, customers are paying, and some form of distribution already exists, even if it is small.\n\nSaaS makes this approach practical. Today it is easier than ever to build, test, and improve products. This is not about copying a business, but about learning from existing validation and executing better for a specific niche through focus, experience, or distribution.\n\nI am seriously considering building something inspired by this approach, not because it is trendy, but because the proof already exists.\n\nCurious to hear thoughts from others here. Do you prefer starting with proven revenue or trying to build something completely new?",

The interesting pattern is that every “tier 3” play you mentioned has two common pieces: repeatable data flow + a predictable distribution channel. If someone wants to copy this, I’d do it backwards: pick a narrow buyer first (ecom brand owner, local lawyer, SaaS founder), then map one painful recurring task they already pay for (content, lead lists, reporting). After that, prototype the fulfillment in a weekend using Gemini/Claude + no-code (n8n, Make, etc.), and only once it works manually, wire up your hunter scripts and outreach on Reddit/LinkedIn. I’ve used PhantomBuster and Clay for that, but Pulse for Reddit plus Apollo-style email has been way more useful when I want to find real demand signals and plug into live conversations instead of cold pitching in a vacuum. Owning a boring, automated pipeline for one niche wins every time over chasing “high-income skills.",

I was literally letting go of opportunities.\n\nI was distracting myself with 1% improvements while avoiding what was probably a 400% business growth at that point.\n\n\nI didn’t magically fix it, but this is how I deal with it now:\n\n1. I only work with big high-ticket clients, so the earnings per talking ratio would be optimal.\n\n2. Brought on a sales rep.\n\n3. Reduced impostor syndrome by becoming more of an expert.

      "text": "I have been running a dev agency for more than 4 years now, and yes, it is a real business. At one point, I had around 10 people on the team, and we were making 6–7 thousand USD per month (I’m from a third‑world country, Azerbaijan, where the average salary is around 400–600 USD). However, it was tough. Managing a team and constantly searching for clients drained a lot of energy and time.\n\nI had what many would call a “dream life”: I could control how and when I worked, technically decide when to take a vacation, and be my own boss. But the reality was different. I didn’t have true freedom. My life slowly became my business.\n\nMy story isn’t unique, I know that. Many smart people warned me that this path wasn’t sustainable and wouldn’t give me real freedom or anything close to passive income. Still, I continued running the business and even expanded to the UK to get easier access to European clients.\n\nThen AI hit hard. Yes, I know it’s been around for more than three years, but its true potential really became clear with the release of ChatGPT 5 and now Opus 4.5, which gives a glimpse of what AGI might look like. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, take a look at tech Twitter - Opus 4.5 can genuinely function as an assistant now with some setup.\n\nI’ve been a developer since I was 13 (25 now), and I know from experience that professional development is hard and time‑consuming. But recent advances in AI have significantly eased the entire process. Today, it’s actually possible to build an MVP, or even a fairly complex SaaS platform - in weeks, or at most a few months. We’ve already done this multiple times, and that’s when I realized it was time to shift.\n\nThe shift was toward focusing on building my own products and removing my dependence on clients.\n\nOver the last six months, I’ve strategically started reducing the size of my team. It was a tough decision, but to make this transition, I needed to lower my running costs. Now I’ve settled on having one junior developer who helps with simple tasks. I’m heavily training her to use AI and leverage the technology as much as possible, and I’ve kept an accountant to handle all legal matters. This month alone, I’ve already built one product, and the second one is currently in progress.\n\nMy recommendation to anyone thinking about starting an agency: think very carefully about what kind of freedom you’re actually aiming for. True freedom is much harder to achieve through an agency than it looks from the outside. In most cases, you’re simply replacing a boss with clients, deadlines, and constant operational pressure.\n\nIf freedom, control over your time, focus, and mental energy is your real goal, it increasingly seems easier to achieve it by building small apps, experimenting with different SaaS products, and creating assets that don’t depend on constant client work. An agency can work, but it has to stay small, highly optimized, and focused on high‑paying customers. Otherwise, it’s very easy to build yourself another full‑time job instead of the freedom you were looking for.",

But eventually you can burn out, particularly if you are both chasing and delivering the service.  \n\nIf you are a creative person who really cares about your clients, you will also tire of always having to explain the various options to every client — and then worry that they will go against your recommendations.  You will find it much better to create your own products and focus your energy and skill on something that sticks with you.

Like, anyone can prompt their way to a working feature now. That's just the reality. But I keep running into devs who can ship stuff but can't explain why they built it that way. Ask them what happens under load or why they picked one approach over another and there's just nothing there.\n\n\n\nAnd the thing is, on day one it all looks the same. Working code is working code. But a few months down the line when something breaks or a requirement changes, you start seeing who actually understood what they built vs who just got lucky with the output.\n\n\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is AI raised the floor massively but the ceiling is still the same. Everyone can build now. But building something that doesn't fall apart when reality hits? That's still hard. And I feel like the market hasn't fully caught up to this yet.\n\n\n\nJust feels like something shifted and it's not being talked about enough.",

By 2016, it was pulling 10 million page views a month.  \nAnd by starting this blog, she \"accidentally\" built a focus group.\n\nReaders were constantly asking where to find the products from her interviews, but Emily noticed she didn't like most of the brands herself. So she decided to build one she would.\n\nIn 2014, Glossier launched with just four products. That's it. No giant catalog. Her readers asked for a better face wash.  \nGlossier turned those comments into Milky Jelly Cleanser, which is now a bestseller.  \nInstead of celebrities, she went all-in on UGC. Customers would post photos, and Glossier would repost them. They picked real customers with small but loyal followings, which resulted in 70% of online sales coming from referrals.\n\nThey grew so fast, but their profit didn't. So they partnered with Sephora and sold their products in Sephora stores. It got them lower margins and a bigger reach. By 2018, four years later, Glossier hit $400 million. By 2021, $1.8 billion.\n\nI didn’t expect a simple blog to turn into a billion-dollar brand, but here we are lol",

It was just me thinking about how every December comes with the same drama: no buses anywhere and transport fares jumping like crazy. I figured instead of complaining again this year, why not fill the gap?  So I just went for it. I got the buses, did all the registration wahala, and placed them at strategic spots around town. And let me tell you, this thing picked up faster than I expected. We are  not even in the peak festive rush yet, but the returns have already been solid. People need transport every day, and the demand has been consistent.   The funny part is that the first set I ordered from Alibaba has already gone up in price. That alone made me realize something important. If you sit on an idea for too long, life will move on without you. Execution will always beat overthinking.   I have  told  few friends the same thing. Stop waiting for the perfect moment. Just start. This transport venture wasn’t even in my plans for the year, but it’s turning out to be one of the smartest moves I made.  Sometimes the best wins come from the decisions you don’t overthink.",

          "text": "Yeah I think it’s a great question. The responses here so far, especially the ones dismissing your point, aren’t discussing power dynamics, which is what you’re describing. Basically, if you hire people better than you, why should they continue to work for you and not take over your job? \n\nThe answer is that you need to bring something to the table. You have to be more visionary, or be willing to work harder so you stay ahead of them, or be willing to do things they don’t want to do, or have so much charisma that you bring intangible value by charming your customers and stakeholders, or some other thing. \n\nA negative strategy you might employ would be to gatekeep information from those employees who are better than you in an effort to hold them down. This would just create a toxic environment. A positive strategy is to acknowledge people’s strengths and to give them more responsibility as the business grows, so they continue to feel heard and supported. Growth is a salve that heals many problems, especially power dynamics. \n\nAlso, it is definitely true that founders are replaced after the company grows if they can no longer add value. Not every founder is meant to be a CEO and that’s okay. Founders can be great visionaries and sales people but cant always scale after achieving initial success and product-market fit. Despite the harm to their ego, this can be good for the founder if they retain their share in the company because their financial wealth increases by promoting someone else into their role to run the company. \n\nI often wonder how Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang retained their roles despite hiring a zillion brilliant people.",

Long story short, a year later the CEO got fired because he missed something that a season COO would NOT have missed. Now having said that, I have seen people hire strong technical talent who would either not be a team player or was so certain they were right all the time that they fought the whole company.
