      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a fullstack software engineer. (htm, css, js, react js, node js). I graduated in computer science and did a few coding bootcamps.  \n  \nI landed a job in 2016 as a dev, I quit in 2018 to try the entrepreneur life. I tried many different businesses ideas, more than 5, everything failed. I'd make ends meet by freelancing Shopify projects and fixing small bugs. I met a lot of nice (and rich) people through this and learned a lot.\n\nWith everything I was learning, I'd always code Shopify apps/chrome extensions with the genuine intent of helping people out. My customers would complain about X, I'd make an app to fix X. I wasn't thinking too much about money, my goal was to make bank by selling products, not apps. \n\nFast forward to 2020. One of the apps blew up almost overnight. I coded a few others based on popular complaints and, in a matter of months, I was profiting $200\\~ USD daily, passively. Some days more, some days less. I could still work on projects and had this nice cushion to support me. \n\nFast-forward to 2026, now I make $0 and I'm going to close my business.\n\nPardon my arrogance, but I'm an excellent programmer. The thing is that there is no market looking for what was once valuable, and I don't really know what to do. Nowadays, being someone with good network/connections is way more valuable than being a top notch programmer.\n\nI invested and saved a lot, so I'm not in a dangerous position (yet), but honestly it's a weird time.\n\nAnyone in a similar position?",

Sure Shopify apps/extensions may no longer be a money maker, but think laterally - is there another platform that is crying out for the same thing?\n\nIf your programming skills are as good as you say, then you should easily be able to pivot to another marketplace.

Your experience can be a massive advantage to help newbies like me. You can create an agency that checks vibe coded apps, fixes them, adds security measures, tests for bugs, and more. You already know what weaknesses can be exploited. \n   I’ve vibe coded a few projects. I have a couple people practically begging me to release one of them and all I shared were screenshots. (It’s honestly a better product than what’s available today!) But I’d love to have a seasoned pro review everything and suggest security fixes, edits or improvements before I officially launch.

Kind of like from deterministic (rule based form filling) to non deterministic work (eg, filling a form via an AI agent after calculating what to fill for each field by checking additional submitted docs). Think of it like an evolution, and its chaotic. I think boring operational inefficiencies in mid-sized companies -20-30 employees is a good area - not too big (long sales cycle and enterprise is expensive), or too small (cannot afford). Logistics, staffing, manufacturing. These guys are drowning in manual work which maybe was not possible earlier but parts of it can now be handled by AI agents. People are not even aware what is possible and if you can truly understand their business overheads and low value work and demonstrate via a POC a satisfactory outcome  (eg saved X hours of manual work), small businesses will be happy to avail your services (agents). \n\nFor eg, I worked with a large marketplace in India recently where we deployed a voice ai agent - they needed Indian english accent - to speak with freelancers to verify and do a level 2 screening. Earlier, this was a huge time suck. Once they tested it (paid POC) and ran it, they were happy to deploy it - currently happening in phases - especially after we established benchmarks on cost, accuracy, false negatives, etc. It’s a bit of process - like building trust in the outcome. And having ways to override the AI outcome if needed.\n\nPS - Saying this from experience as an engineer turned product manager turned AI consultant (yeah pivots).",

      "text": "Give or take a few days, my mate started his \"boutique\" gym around this time last year. Focusing on \"hyper-personalised\" training programs.\n\nWhen he first invested a ton of cash into matte black paint, equipment, big frameless mirrors, motivational quotes on the walls, I thought he'd gone mad. I didn't see much traction for the first couple of months.\n\nBut now he charges £80 per 90 minute personal training session. His personal trainers are not really certified at all, they're just fit looking university students he pays £15 an hour.\n\nBefore each client's first session they fill out a detailed questionnaire on this iPad with their goals, injuries, experience level, all the usual stuff. They even pose for a few \"before\" pics.\n\nThen everything is uploaded straight to ChatGPT and it spits out a 12 week progressive program, exercise form cues and even some motivational talking points tailored to that specific client.\n\nThen all these trainers do is pull up the program on their phone and just guide clients through it. They are literally reading the ChatGPT response word for word.\n\nHe charges £80 per session and has on average 4 sessions a day across 5 different trainers. The average client books 2 sessions a week for at least 3 months.\n\nRight now monthly revenue is around 40k with trainer costs being about 11k and the gym overhead is 5k so there's approx 24k a month left. And yeah, I know that is not pure profit, you have to account for equipment lease costs, corp tax, other bills and all that.\n\nSo far nobody has complained and he keeps saying ChatGPT has access to thousands of peer-reviewed studies and decades of training data, it's  qualified enough.\n\nNow, here is where it gets interesting cos he wants me to help him scale this to 2 more locations. I don't think any other locations would come close to the central parts of London but he says there are many cities this would work.\n\nIs this a smart scalable business or am I helping him build a house of cards?",

Personal training is much more about behavior change, motivational counseling, and peer support/accountability than just spitting out exercise programs which anyone can look up online. Expecting ai to fill that consistent relatable peer support role is like thinking buying an alarm clock will automatically make you a morning person.\n\n  \nEven Layne norton, a long time professional trainer and phd nutritionist, with clear incentive to promote his own training, has himself admitted that he wouldve rather studied behavior change than nutrition in school. Because most people coming to him for training already have made the first step (choosing to get a trainer), and he realized he can't take honest responsibility for their initial progress. It's more about sustaining that motivation over the long term (where most clients drop off). That's a lot more nuanced than spitting out a 12 week bodybuilding template.",

          "text": "This is a house of cards. The reason this is such \"easy money\" is what makes gyms and training unprofitable in the long term. Its a race to the bottom when everyone can do the same thing with zero barrier to entry. High selling trainers go out on their own, long term clients dont need the service anymore etc. You need more upsells, you need actual value add other than spitting out programs. You need drilling on behavior change, individualized nutrition support, etc. These things take expertise and time, the margins get thinner, etc.\n\nGyms can have captive audiences, unique offerings, value adds that succeed more often. Larry Wheels gym succeeded because he didnt need to buy equipment and got sponsor companies, on top of being famous in the fitness space.\n\nHormozi succeeded by overselling old-school sales funnels most people will laugh at today and think are obvious scams. (12 week \"challenges\" with shady money back practices). You can't do that anymore with the same consistency.\n\nCreate an actual business plan with unique offerings and really sell the human aspect rather than the idea of spitting out template programs.\n\nIt works if you are a huge influencer or successful in a unique niche. Not so much if you are a random selling templates. If youre not trying to become an influencer, actually use that as a selling point to be more relatable (you are selling the peer support and individualized motivation, you understand peoples pain points, youre not just some cash grab influencer trash).",

My definition of wealthy is very close to the one you described, however I have been reading and listening and sometimes I also feel the universe is holding a big panel at me saying stop wanting to own a home because the recent information I have are famous investment advisors who rent a flat rather than buy a home because they call it a liability and instead buy one to rent it. \nHowever, some people who coach others to start a business often say they bought a giant house and live the life of their dreams. \n\nSo honestly, I don't really know. I guess the idea today is that internet all the tech and TV's are accessories and that money and business exist without them too and being rich implies work and dedication and you do not need to have a Bentley or a Rolls Royce to be rich. \n\nI feel if you have the money accomplish your dream lifestyle because otherwise you will ask yourself is it worth it. But then maybe change things, sell the flashy car for a basic one, dump the designer styles for everyday stuff and sell or even better rent the giant house and get a cozy flat to rent or buy one without a mortgage if you are very rich and pretend it has a rent and save your money too.",

People give the AI a vague request or dump a pile of information on it and expect it to somehow know what matters, what it should ignore, and where the lines are.\n\nWhen it doesn’t have that clarity, it doesn’t stop. It guesses. That’s where a lot of the “why is it making stuff up?” anger comes from.\n\nI ended up putting together a short guide after watching this play out a lot. Not to fix backend systems, but to help people better understand how missing context, loose instructions, and unclear expectations push the AI into filling in the gaps.\n\nClean data helps, but it doesn’t fix the part where people assume the AI knows what matters. If you don’t spell that out, it’ll happily make something up and move on.",

I have seen so many of the newer people that have jumped into AI, become a newbie \"guru\" and not even learn some of the basic steps i learned in the beginning. I built ny first bot on my first workshop and, I never tried to pretend I knew what I was do I nor teach anyone else until that time came along. People like to sit at the front though and raise their hand, answer first and get the gold star. For some its all about rising to the top instead of doing shit right. My \"teacher\"  had told us at one point in time they'll be a lot of bots and custom gpts out there at some time coming soon that will all be programmed to do the wrong thing. How scary.

A bot that invents info isn’t “helpful,” it’s dangerous for a business. Fake discounts, wrong shipping thresholds, medical ish claims like hypoallergenic… that’s not a small mistake, that’s real damage.\n\nWhen I build a chatbot, the goal isn’t to sound confident  it’s to be **as close to 99% accurate as possible**, even if that means the bot says *“I don’t have that information”* or hands off to a human. Silence is better than lying.\n\nSo yeah, I fully agree with you: a chatbot that hallucinates is worse than no chatbot at all. If it can’t stick strictly to product descriptions, policies, and store rules, it has no business talking to customers.\n\nYour frustration is 100% valid.",

There is nothing more terrifying for a business owner than an AI \"manifesting\" fake discount codes or lying about product safety. That jewelry story is a nightmare.\n\nThe real issue is that most of these bot companies are just selling \"fancy autocomplete.\" They use ChatGPT to be creative, but in business, you don’t want a creative bot—you want a factual one.\n\nI’m actually building a support tool right now specifically to kill this hallucination problem. I use something called RAG, which basically forces the AI to keep its \"eyes\" on your docs only. If the info isn't explicitly in your product descriptions or settings, the bot is literally not allowed to make it up. It’s an \"open book\" system—no data, no answer.\n\nI also added a floating WhatsApp/Call button alongside the chat because, let's be real, sometimes a bot just isn't enough and the customer needs a human immediately.\n\nYou’ve clearly been through the ringer with those 3 bots. If you're up for it, I’d love for you to \"stress-test\" what I’ve built. No charge, no sales pitch—I just want to see if you can break my guardrails. I’d rather a bot say \"I don't know\" than commit fraud against your customers lol.",

That was me.\n\nAt some point I read something very simple, it said stop thinking about 10k and just try to make 1 dollar. That sentence stayed in my head.\n\nSo in June I just tried to make 1 dollar online, nothing more. I’m in the surf niche, so I made a simple inside joke design, put it on a mug because mugs felt low risk, built a Shopify store in about 2 days and ran some ads.\n\nWhen the first sale came in and I saw that 1 dollar, I just stared at the screen for a moment. After almost 2 years of zero, it felt unreal.\n\nAt the beginning it wasn’t really profitable and some days I was just happy I didn’t lose money, but I kept changing small things, reading a bit, trying again, and then it clicked.\n\nIn around 20 days I sold about 400 mugs and made a bit over 2k profit.\n\nWhat surprised me the most wasn’t even the money, but what happened after I started really working instead of just thinking, because suddenly I understood how things actually work, I learned more in a few weeks than in the 2 years before, and I started seeing opportunities everywhere.\n\nIdeas stopped feeling like fantasies and more like things I could actually test, and that feeling alone is fucking gold.\n\nI’m still learning and still figuring things out, but I remember how stuck I felt before and just wanted to share this, maybe it helps someone who’s in that same place right now.\n\nThat’s it.

      "text": "So still most people in Kenya still rely on mobile data bundles for internet access and in all honesty Safaricom (and friends) absolutely milk that system. Bundles expire, speeds drop, and you’re paying more for less. Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is cheaper, more convenient, and way more scalable… if you can get it close to people.\n\nI live in a fairly remote area, but I’m close to a market that’s still developing. One day a friend visited me and casually suggested I try running a Wi-Fi hotspot around there. At first, I didn’t take it seriously. I assumed everyone would just use Safaricom bundles for those unable  to buy wifi installation services,so I didn’t see why anyone would pay for local Wi-Fi.\nAfter thinking about it for a while, I decided to try anyway purely as an experiment.\n\nI didn’t start big or spend much. I used a second-hand MikroTik router my friend sold me, added a basic Tenda router, and connected everything to my existing Airtel 5G line, which I already pay for monthly. We ran a long Ethernet cable outside, mounted the equipment in a small box, and pointed the antennas toward the market. That was the entire setup.\n\nOn the first day, from around 10am to midnight, I made about 1,200 KES. I assumed it was just people being curious and trying something new. But the same thing happened the next day, and the day after that. On slower days I make around 1,500 KES, and on good days it goes up to about 2,000 KES.Crazy!!\n\nWithin about a week, I had recovered all my initial costs. That’s when it stopped feeling like a small side experiment and started feeling like a real opportunity.\n\nLater, a friend showed me his own dashboard. He averages around 15,000 KES per day. He also mentioned others who earn much more, but those setups are larger fiber connections, multiple locations, and years of gradual expansion. That’s when I realized this business doesn’t grow overnight. It grows with infrastructure, patience, and consistency.\n\nThe hardest part for me wasn’t the money or the hardware. It was learning how to configure MikroTik properly and setting up the billing system. Without guidance, I probably would have quit early out of frustration. Once everything was configured correctly, though, the system became fairly stable and mostly runs itself.\n\nI’m not posting this to sell anything or claim I’ve figured everything out. I just wanted to share an honest experience for anyone who’s curious . You can start small, learn as you go, and grow slowly while doing things properly over time.\n\nEstimated capital (based on my setup)\nMikroTik router  5,000 KES\nTenda router 1,500 KES\nBilling system (iterativebilling.com)  1,000 KES\nAirtel 5G internet 3,000 KES\nElectricity 1,500 KES per month\nTotal: 12,000 KES\n\nThis could definitely grow into something bigger, but it would require an big investors for better equipment, stronger infrastructure, and proper licensing. I’m still researching the regulatory side and long term setup. With the right investment and planning, this could be a solid business, especially in underserved areas.",

Also, include the prices in both KES and USD for easy interpretation by most people. You should definitely consider the Starlinks option too. As many people mentioned in the post, large telecoms company can be very brutal if you infringe into their territory and they usually have strong connections within government.

      "text": "I've seen hundreds of pitch decks, met dozens of founders in 2025, and made dozens of pitch decks. Talked to many investors and asked their insights about pitch decks for whole year. Here is what I learned this year:\n\n1. **The problem slide is where you win or lose.** If an investor doesn't lean forward on slide 2, the rest doesn't matter. Most founders bury their best insight on slide 8.\n2. **Founders who've experienced the problem they're solving tell better stories.** Personal connection > market research every single time.\n3. **The \"platform\" word is poison.** I removed it from at least 10 decks this year. Just tell me what the thing actually does.\n4. **Traction without context is useless.** \"10K users\" means nothing. \"10K users, 23% MoM growth, $47 average revenue per user\" means something.\n5. **Most market size slides are bullshit, and investors know it.** TAM/SAM/SOM with numbers pulled from Statista doesn't impress anyone. Show me YOUR math based on YOUR customer segments.\n6. **Financial projections are fiction, but they reveal how you think.** Show you understand unit economics and investors will forgive aggressive growth assumptions. Show hockey sticks with no underlying logic and investors will assume you don't know your business.\n7. **The team slide should answer \"why you, why now.\"** Your advisor's LinkedIn profile doesn't matter. Your 10 years solving this exact problem does.\n8. **Asking for money without showing what milestones is just amateur.** \"We need $2M for hiring and marketing\" isn't a plan. \"$2M gets us to $100K MRR and 18-month runway\" is.\n9. **Design matters less than founders think, but more than they act like it does.** Your deck doesn't need to be gorgeous, but it can't look like you don't give a shit.\n10. **Every deck should answer: what's the insight only you have?** If I could've thought of your idea without domain expertise, it's not compelling enough.\n11. **Slide count doesn't matter.** Based on my experience and Carta's insights, there's no correlation between slide number and fundraising success. If a slide is meaningful, keep it. If a slide is just \"nice to have,\" remove it.\n12. **Founders confuse features with benefits.** \"AI-powered matching algorithm\" doesn't mean shit to anyone. \"Cuts hiring time from 60 days to 12\" does.\n13. **The fundraising story matters as much as the business story.** Why this round, why this amount, why now etc. If you can't articulate it clearly, investors smell desperation.\n14. **The decks that got funded weren't perfect but they were clear.** Clarity beats cleverness every single time.\n15. **Nobody reads Slide 1 (Cover slide).** They glance at it for 3 seconds. If your tagline is a paragraph, you've already lost.\n16. **\"AI\" is a feature, not a business.** In Q1 2025, slapping \"AI\" on a slide worked. Now? It's noise. Tell me what problem you solve, not what tech stack you use.\n17. **The \"Conservative Estimate\" Lie.** We know your Year 5 projection of $100M ARR is fake. You know it's fake. Focus on how you get the first $1M instead of giving huge promises.\n18. **One idea per slide.** I see founders trying to cram the Problem, Solution, and Market Size onto one slide to \"save space.\" Don't. It looks like a random note.\n19. **Your TAM is wrong.** If you claim your Total Addressable Market is \"The Global Internet,\" you don't know who your customer is. Niche down.\n20. **Font size 10 is illegal.** If an investor has to squint to read your LTV/CAC ratio on a mobile screen, they're closing the file.\n21. **Bullet points are boring.** Use icons, use charts, use big numbers. Walls of text are for legal contracts, not pitch decks.\n22. **Stop using \"Uber for X.\"** It's almost 2026. Come up with your own category.\n23. **The Appendix is your best friend.** Keep the main deck short and tell your story clearly. Put the technical deep dives in the appendix.\n24. **PDF is the only format.** Don't send a Keynote. Don't send a PPT. Fonts break. Layouts shift. Send a PDF.\n25. **Your \"Exit Strategy\" is presumptuous.** You haven't sold one unit yet. Don't tell me about your IPO plans.\n26. **Data needs context.** Don't just show a graph going up. Label the axes. Explain the spike. Everybody love labeled axes.\n27. **Consistency signals competence.** If your headers jump around and your colors shift slightly, investors subconsciously think your code is messy too.\n28. **Frameworks kill the story.** Most founders try to use famous frameworks. But those frameworks push founders to be standard. Instead of this, create your own story.\n29. **Competition slide is your positioning.** Everybody knows you cannot compete with Google, Apple, OpenAI or other big corporates. But you really can focus a niche and grow in a vertical. You don't have to write a complex competition slide. X-Y landscape is great but you have to choose the right X and Y angles and be perfect on your niche.\n30. **Don't separate \"Why Now\" into its own slide.** Weave it naturally into your problem (it's urgent), market (it's shifting), and competition (giants are slow). When \"why now\" is isolated, it feels forced.\n\n**My predictions for 2026:**\n\n**AI will review your deck before humans do.** I've talked to investors and many of them are already using AI reviews, custom GPTs, Claude, Gemini on their emails. Your pitch deck isn't just for humans anymore. You need to explain your business to AI too. Find the balance: clear enough for AI to understand, compelling enough for humans to care.\n\n**Pre-seed rounds will get harder.** Building an MVP is easier than ever thanks to AI. So investors are asking for revenue or real traction even at pre-seed, and their bar will keep rising. My advice? Generate traction first, fundraise later -when it is possible of course. (And possible doesn't mean \"if you have money\", it means \"if it is possible as technical\")\n\n**Investor outreach will be noisier than ever.** Automation tools are everywhere now. Anyone can build a bulk email campaign to investors. Standing out will require actual creativity, not just another cold email template. The spray-and-pray approach is literally dead.",

The point about AI reviewing decks before humans really hit home, it’s the next big hurdle for founders.\n\nThat prediction is exactly why I built a custom “Pitch Deck Analyst” agent on GenSpark. I trained it on feedback from actual investors (and posts like this!). Now, when I feed it a draft, it acts like that brutally honest pre-screening AI you mentioned. It flags stuff like: “Your ‘10K users’ claim has no context,” or “Slide 5 crams problem and solution, pick one,” or “Your financials jump without a clear ‘how’.” It’s my sandbox to pressure-test decks for both AI clarity and human appeal before they go out the door.\n\nBuilding this kind of targeted agent is what platforms like GenSpark are great for. It’s become an indispensable tool to navigate exactly the future you’re describing.",

I run a store with a wide range of customizable products, and I need a tool that not only shows products in 3D but also lets my customers interact with them easily. Here's a quick rundown of my thoughts so far:\n\n* **Zakeke:** The ease of integration and its strong focus on user experience really stand out to me. It’s API-first, and it seems much more agile than some of the other platforms. Plus, I’ve heard great things about its web-to-print capabilities, which is essential for some of my custom products.\n* **Threekit:** This one is impressive, especially for high quality visuals. The \"Virtual Photography\" feature is a huge plus for marketing, but it seems to come with a steeper learning curve and a more complicated pricing structure. I’m not sure it’s worth the complexity, especially for a growing business.\n* **Expivi:** The interface is clean and intuitive, but it lacks some of the deeper integration capabilities that I think Zakeke offers. while the 3D modeling is nice, it doesn’t seem as scalable as Threekit for large product catalogs.\n\nI’m mainly looking for a solution that combines flexibility, ease of integration, and strong customization tools without too much overhead. for those of you who’ve worked with these tools, which one works best for customizable product stores and why? do you have any feedback on ERP syncing or the ability to scale?",

For someone with ADHD, interest isn’t always persistent. Motivation fluctuates, and it’s easy to slip into a procrastination loop.\n\nThat loop can be costly. lost time, wasted money, missed opportunities, and unrealized potential, often with nothing tangible to show for the effort until the business finally becomes profitable. Unlike a regular job, entrepreneurship offers no immediate structure, deadlines, or external accountability. You’re responsible not only for execution, but also for creating your own systems, discipline, and momentum.\n\nSo realistically, how do you manage everything? How do you stay focused when your brain constantly seeks novelty? How do you build consistency when your energy comes in waves? And how do you protect yourself from burnout, self-doubt, and paralysis while still pushing forward in a world that rewards long-term persistence?",

          "text": "Caffeine.   \n    \nElectronic music loud enough to drown out my thoughts.   \n    \nAnd most importantly: **Scheduling**.    \n   \nLiterally the only things more important to success than making and keeping a schedule are breathing, drinking water, eating food, and sleeping. Way too many people, including you just now, use the word \"discipline\" and I think that hinders success. Because tons of people recognize that they need \"discipline\" but I don't think very many of them actually know what it is. Discipline is simply having a code or set of rules that you follow, and actually following it. Want to know an *extremely* easy way to do that? Set a schedule. Having and following a schedule *is* discipline. Any time you see the word discipline, change it out for scheduling. No schedule? No discipline. Plain and simple.     \n    \nWe ***know*** scheduling works. Look at every school on the planet. Did you go to history class or geometry when you \"felt like it\" or \"were in the mood\"? No. You went when the bell rang because there was a schedule. And people who haven't been in a classroom in 20+ years still wake up in a cold sweat from time to time after having a *nightmare* they were late to class. Why? Because scheduling has an extremely potent psychological effect.    \n    \nIf you want to succeed, set a schedule. On $DAY at $TIME for $DURATION I'm going to do $SPECIFIC_TASK.   \n    \nIf you don't know when to set your schedule, 10:00AM to 12:00PM on Sundays is your new time to work on your schedule, and you will set your schedule for the following two weeks. Adjust as needed. And make your schedule obvious so that it's something you look at every day. It needs to be somewhere where you are unable to miss it.   \n    \nI also want to mention that sometimes we don't have things broken down enough yet to get a good specific task out of them. Taking the time to figure out specific tasks of a larger project is itself a task that you need to schedule and do.",

The part about breaking down projects into specific tasks is something I've been avoiding because it feels tedious, but you're right that \"work on business\" is too vague to actually execute on when my brain is bouncing all over the place.

          "text": "Personally, time management and ADHD management is a skill you have to develop through your lifetime, your the only one who knows how you work so you gotta experiment. But i'll share with what I did personally. Some people mention medication, for me I refuse to get medicated but to each man his own.\n\n1. Time Management For me personally I use Google Calendar, Notion Calendar, And Notion for Task and Schedule management. I have elaborate pages that carries out all my tasks, and have a recurring task even so I don't have to redo them. I have 2 Notion pages mainly for my life, and for my work. I will probably have another one as I start a family or a business. These are my holy grail but find what works for you.\n2. Timers For me to stay on track and focused, I need to be disciplined. I use timer for everything. there's two main things to use it for Time Boxing and Pomodoro\n\nPomodoro - Use it for long tasks so you can pace yourself well and not burn out \\[30min work - 5min break, 3 rounds then a 30min break, do the ratio that works for you\\]\n\nTimeboxing - Use for pretty much any tasks especially when you feel like procrastinating, we procrastinate because we already calculate in our heads how much work its gonna take so we'd rather not do it. You have to trick your brain to overcome it, instead of going to the gym for 1 hour, tell yoursel out loud, i'm gonna wear my shoes for 2 mins \\*start the timer for 2 mins, i'm gonna drive to the gym for 10 mins \\*start timer for 10 mins, etc.  \nHere are the links (sure you can use your iphone timer, but you may get distracted):  \nI use 2 timers, 1 hand held and 1 for desk, you can DM me for the amazon link.\n\n3. Brain Dumping and Journaling  \nFor ADHDers like us its as if we have 5 different thoughts occuring at once, you should know that unless these thoughts are acknowledged its gonna keep running in your head forever, overwhelming you. You need something to pour your thoughts too right away. I either use the note app on my iphone or I carry around a pocket notepad, I literally right down everything that comes up \"theres a show I wanna watch!\" or \"I need to get my tire changed\" or \"I wonder how babies are made\". Then later on when you have time, you can go over your notes and put it on your task manager and do them. You should probably journal too.\n\n4. Health  \nTake care of you physical and mental health. The more unhealthy you are the more difficult it is to manage yourself and the more unstable you are. Get proper sleep, eat right, take some time to exercise, and maintain your emotions through journaling. Cut off or atleast moderate unhealthy habits (junkfood, doom scrolling, porn). You mention your brain seeks novelty, sure. I think its mainly stimulation and dopamine, if your healthy your brain doesn't need so much to function (If you do high dopamine activities such as doom scrolling of course your not gonna find going on a nice stroll \"novel\") You can use stimulants like coffee and energy drinks but these are short term solutions to long term problems, keep yourself healthy and you will rarely reach for the caffeine.\n\n5. Scheduling  \nKnow your biology, your body functions on different energy levels throughout the day, experiment and find your magic spot. You can't do high level energy activities all day, you will burn out. For me my schedule is divided to 3 parts 6am-1pm Deep Hard Work 1pm-2pm Lunch 2pm-7pm Moderate Level Work 7pm-8pm dinner 8pm-11pm Low Energy / Relax > Sleep\n\nThere's more things I will share on my comment below",

              "text": "6. Consistency  \nDon't push yourself too hard, the turtle wins the race, small incremental steps build in the long run over inconsistent sprints. (Better for you to set 20 min workouts a day consistently than set 60 min hard workout but you fail and only do twice). Do something I call \"Minimum Winning\" If you can't do something because you don't have time or too tired, do the absolute bare minimum to at least say you did it! (Too tired to go on a run? Just put on your shoes walk outside and walk back in, that counts!) This teaches you to remain consistent for the long term.\n\n7. Active Practice  \nBecause of ADHD we easily get into this sort of thought, planning paralysis. Executive Dysfunction. We analyze more and plan but we barely do. For example i'm giving you a lot of info, take some time to absorb this slowly. Practice more than learning. Its hard to explain this but pretty much keep your theory to practice ratio to about 1/5. Don't fall into a trap of reading all the self help books and watching youtube videos but never doing any of it. Just take it one at a time, take small bites and chew thoroughly.\n\n8. Mindfulness  \nThis is my last one. Your mindset plays a lot of role into this, so keep your mental healthy. Try to do some journaling, practice things such as self forgiveness, your never gonna be perfect, your days won't be perfect, you will fail and fall, bad days come, your plans don't go according to plan. Accept this, learn, and get up again. Learn to manage your emotions, I'm very sensitive and emotional, if my heart is troubled I can't do anything but sit and dwell on it, I fall to depression sometimes. Manage yourself so you catch yourself before you hit rock bottom. If you do hit it, that's fine the only way is up :)\n\nIts a lot but its really helped me and I hope it helps you and others who read this.\n\nCheck this guy on youtube his name is Newel of Knowledge, these 3 videos helped me get out of depression.  \n1 How to do hard things  \n2 How to manage emotion  \n3 How to Resist Temptation",

It happened way too many times, more than I could imagine. But I kept going on. Sometimes right away, sometimes after days, even, weeks of doing nothing. \nI've been trying to figure a way out of that magic circle: energy - burnout - self-doubt - paralysis, something that would make me more firm in all the mental chaos.\n\nWhat, I dare to say, helped me:\n\n1. Stop trying to \"fix\" your brain - your brain isn't broken, it's just overloaded with too many inputs and no stopping points\n\n2. Reduce decision fatigue - automate the small stuff so you have mental bandwidth for what matters\n\n3. Create external structure - deadlines, accountability, body doubling (even virtual)\n\n4. Give yourself permission to work in bursts (this is where I fall constantly) - stop forcing 8-hour focus days if your brain doesn't work that way\n\nI actually made a short survival manual for this exact problem (ADHD-friendly, no motivation \"bla-bla\"), just practical relief for overloaded brains like mine. Not sure if I can share links here, but it's on my profile in About section, if you or anyone is up for it.\nAdjust your systems, not yourself.\nCheers and good luck!",

We’re not positioning as a full-stack “we do everything” digital agency. The focus is performance-driven content and production — short-form video, UGC-style creatives, and ads that actually convert, not just look good. That’s where most brands here are still weak.\n\nGeographic arbitrage alone doesn’t work long term. The play is specialization + execution, not location hype. UAE just happens to be a market where that combo gets rewarded faster if you deliver.\n\nHappy to break down the numbers or strategy further if you’re genuinely curious.",

They don't want to shut you down in a conversation so they engage, ask questions, and make you feel heard. Then they go back to their lives and forget you exist. With our clients doing early validation the breakthrough moment is always when someone does something unprompted that costs them time or effort.\n\nThe question that separates real from fake is asking them to commit to something small right now. Not later, not hypothetically. \"Can I send you a rough prototype next week and get 15 minutes of feedback?\" If they say yes and actually respond when you send it, that's signal. If they hedge or go silent, the interest was performative.\n\nStop counting positive conversations and start counting actions taken. Ten people who said \"sounds interesting\" means nothing. One person who asked to be first in line when you launch means everything.",

Like if they actually follow up without you prompting them or connect you with someone they know, that means they cared enough to think about you when you weren't in front of them. Friendly reactions in the moment are basically just being polite. It's the equivalent of \"we should hang out sometime!\" that never turns into actual plans",

Without spending money I don’t have, I spent a year ingraining myself to become an industry expert. I realized that my COGS, with everything, was “only” $13,700 not including $200k manufacturing costs. I used my own money instead. \n\nThe same investors who rejected me are now confused as to how I managed to get everything up and running. Two of them have had to write off their investments. \n\nI know that, once I start scaling nationwide, I can go back to them, or possibly not even need external investors. I still haven’t paid myself anything in two years. It’s definitely a grind. Based on my experience, I wouldn’t invest this soon. Invest your own funds first, but you need to find a way to bootstrap and be efficient. It’s too early for external partners unless you have a product that is just THAT special and industry-changing. Invest in yourself instead for now. To be “fundable,” you need to show a good value proposition. What makes you stand out from the competition? Why should consumers buy your product? What’s your profit margin? There are also other factors that could be industry specific. For example, one investor that’s interested in my company right now told me yesterday that, “I want to see your product sold at this specific place that I like”",

      "text": "I want to share a reminder that small, thoughtful changes can compound faster than most people expect.\n\nI created my first product after my father died. I called it the “Estate Preparation Package.” The goal was simple. Help families organize critical estate information so the people left behind were not scrambling.\n\nWhat I did not anticipate was the confusion.\n\nA lot of people assumed they were buying a will or legal documents and I lost them in the funnel. That was not the product. I was solving an organization and action problem, not a legal drafting problem. But the name and framing were bad.\n\nSo I made a change.\n\nI renamed the product the CLEAR Kit. It became both a product name and an acronym. (Comprehensive legacy and estate administration repository.) It sounded tangible, not like a professional service, but more importantly it clarified what it was (and just as importantly what it was not).\n\nSales tripled.\n\nRecently, I made another set of changes that were far less dramatic but just as intentional. I rewrote the product page to focus on benefits instead of features. Less about what is included, more about what families can actually do with it. I also cleaned up metadata across Shopify so the product was easier to understand by both people and search engines.\n\nSales tripled again.\n\nNo viral moment. No massive rebrand. No new product.\n\nJust clearer language, better positioning, and a willingness to admit that confusion is usually our fault as founders.\n\nThe lesson I keep relearning is this. Incremental improvements stack. When you remove friction at multiple small points, the cumulative effect can be enormous.\n\nIf something isn't converting, don't assume the idea is broken. Sometimes the explanation is.",

      "text": "TL;DR - the ups and (many many) downs of starting your own agency, semi enjoyable read. Lessons Learnt at the end, for anyone in a similar position.\n\n\n\nStarted out in the space 2024, I lost my job working at a startup and decided to go freelance. And here is what 2025 looked like as the first FULL year as an agency owner starting from 0.\n\n\n\nTried to keep concise and pragmatic.\n\n\n\nQ1 - INITIAL EXCITMENT\n\n\n\nStarted the year well, we had a project lined up for building an AI SDR for a French startup. Things started well, but scope creeped to always adding more features, when pushing back to sign the contract. Suddenly not a priority anymore.\n\n\n\nThis then led to a huge outreach effort and SM posting about the solution. At this time the solution was featured on Liam Ottley’s YT video, that coupled with some viral reddit posts. Led us to onboard 5 ish clients. Had salesforce knock on the door - small flex (lol)\n\n\n\nQ2 - MAKING THE BEST OF AN OPPORTUNITY\n\n\n\nWe did the classic, onboarded too much. Which led to the inevitable, reduction in performance and lesser outcomes for clients. Churn kicked us in the stomach.\n\n\n\nFrom here partnerships with pre-existing agencies to do AI and Dev work began. Being given projects without full say on the scope, was pretty rough. Had projects to deliver 10 AI agents … \n\n\n\nBut was good cashflow, and ultimately this is when the 12 hour days started. As the projects were sold off the back of AI will replace a team of people. Scopes were ENORMOUS, and we foolishly said yes :L\n\n\n\nQ3 - THE REAL SH-T SHOW BEGINS\n\n\n\nWorking 6-7 days a week become normal & 24/7 stress.\n\n\n\nThis is when the sizes of projects became TRULY apparent. And when I truly discovered the REAL limits of AI. What will work well 85% of the time is a few weeks of intense work. And  going from 85 —> 90% effectiveness is an exponential journey (months), 1 change in the AI (prompt) will throw things off wildly, and testing becomes 10x longer…\n\n\n\nTried to partner with another agency, didn’t go too well. From being in the trenches fixing things 24/7 led me to almost forget how to delegate work effectively. \n\n\n\nOn a positive - somehow managed to start sitting at tables at billion dollar companies, speaking with legitimate 30yr IT professionals about integrating AI. Being a young guy led to many - “who tf is this?” - having a baby face didn’t help either XD\n\n\n\n\\> Also discovered, EVERYONE loves talking about AI but can never go deeper with actually how it works in the real world.\n\n\n\nQ4 - SALVAGING FROM RUINS\n\n\n\nStarted consuming monstrous amounts of caffeine, and fights with the partner became more frequent. With having such variable income, meant having no time for the relationship. Date night perma cancelled, quality netlfix time became laptop and chill (lol)\n\nRounding off the year, was mainly finising up the larger projects. Tried to hire devs offshore, absolute mess. Tried to charge 200USD for setting up a GitHub repo and 1 meeting - yikes\n\n  \nBuild systems that genuinely worked well. From Automated mood board creation for interior designers, Reactivation campaigns for Mortgage company with Voice AI, Many RAG systems. An SEO blog automation which basically replaced a team … And many smaller jobs here and there.\n\n\n\nLESSONS LEARNT:\n\n* Don’t sell features - if you sell features - you will always add more features to seal the deal\n* Don’t try to rush the delicate art of negotiating a deal. It WILL backfire on you\n* Onboarding hype is REAL for AI projects. Manage expectations ASAP - it will take twice as long and fail in unexpected ways\n* NEVER do free work - 2 weeks to get a demo, then boom ghosted\n* !! Reddit inbound (content) is the way forward !!\n* Have time for play - reset your mind and allows you to get back to “normal”\n* Voice AI is probably the best use case vs effort to implement.\n* Sk00L is SURPRISINGLY good for landing clients\n\n\n\nMY PERSONAL HUNCHES FOR 2026:\n\n* The Claude Code framework will be the default framework for AI agent teams\n* N8N and workflow automation tools will be replaced by agentic / vibe coding (controversial - I know). The hype around April / June was insane, I think it will die down\n* I will enjoy using Lang chain ……. -  this will never happen XD\n\n\n\nInterested to see whose year was a roller coaster as well! \n\n",

Quality was inconsistent because some days I had ideas and energy, other days I was just forcing it\n\nI switched to batching everything on monday mornings. Block out 3 hours, create all my content for the week in one focused session and thats way more efficient because I'm in the creative zone and not context switching constantly.\n\nHere's my actual process now: I brainstorm 5-7 content ideas on sunday night, just write them down in notion then monday morning I create all of them back to back. Usually ends up being like 15-20 pieces of content once I break things down for different platforms\n\nIm using blotato to handle the platform specific formatting so I'm not manually resizing everything and adjusting captions for linkedin vs instagram vs twitter. That alone saves probably like 2 hours\n\nI went from spending roughly 11 hours per week on content spread throughout the week to about 3 hours on monday. Freed up 8 hours that I'm using for actual revenue generating work now and content quality is more consistent too because I'm not forcing creativity every single day, sometimes you just dont have it and that's fine",

A few bucks on an LLM, maybe another tool, and everything feels incremental.\n\nThe real cost shows up when you hit that wall. The code mostly works, the bug is subtle, and the AI keeps guessing. Every suggestion sounds right. None of them fix it. Looping (is there a better term for the hell?).\n\nSo you keep going. Another prompt. Another hour gone.\n\nBeing humans, I dunno is this our primordial brains, there’s no invoice, we treat that time as free. But it isn’t. It’s lost momentum, burned weekends, and shipping later than planned.\n\nMost people will spend four or five hours stuck just to avoid paying for ten minutes of certainty.\n\nBringing a human in has risks. Trust, context, security. That hesitation makes sense. But looping with AI isn’t risk-free either, it just hides the cost.\n\nAt some point the question becomes simple: what is your time actually worth when you’re stuck?\n\nCurious how others handle that moment.

Code comes and bite you.** Producing code is not the hard part. Translating your objectives to as little code, of as much quality as possible, is the difficult part.\n\n*Every software project has a life expectancy.* Over time, you fix bugs, change things, follow trends, implement features. And inexorably, code quality degrades, more bugs pop up, or you find out that the easy feature is actually super complicated to implement given the current state of the code base.\n\nWhen you are a young inexperienced developer, you code with limited foresight and architecture expertise. The life expectancy of the software is then usually a few months or a year of daily modifications. As you gain experience and skill, your software gets a longer expected lifespan. Top developers that I've met or witnessed the work of (I'm talking open-source project leaders in their fifties) are able to write code with a life expectancy of about 15 to 20 years.\n\nYou see? **At no point I'm saying that producing the code is difficult**. I'm saying that producing code that you will not have to reinvest time into later on is difficult. And, sadly, LLMs are very novice programmers. Yes, they have been trained on lots of code. They know lots of class and function names. But they spit out the most naive solution to your prompt, with no foresight or architecture.\n\nI may be a bit extreme, but for the moment, my evaluations of vibe coding tools and AI-completions in IDEs is quite negative. My colleagues using this experience much lower software life expectancy, and way more bugs. To me, this is injecting poison in your project.",

As an Engineer who founded startups, I'm so glad I didn't have to go through that. Just because you find someone who can code doesnt give you any sense of whether or not they can built the app. Most \"Engineers\" are really coders who can take direction.\n\n2) \"startup mindset is so easy to claim but so hard to actually find in the wild\" True. Almost no engineer wants to take much of a pay cut, let alone what you can probably afford.\n\nYour hardest task is identifying the right person, agencies are sell, so they just cost extra and will claim every engineer they rep can build an MVP. It's your job to not only find and filter, but to SELL TO THEM.\n\nMany Engineers who can take an app from begining to end have their own projects. Even those who can't run the process end-2-end are hard to sell. Those with a track record often have bidding wars.\n\n3) You're gonna hate hearing this, but if you think 6 months isn't worth finding the right person and selling them on your idea, its over. \n\nAs I mentioned before, just finding the right person is a huge accomplishment. There is no place you can just go and find these types. And not being technical, I can't imagine how you could validate them. So the first two parts are unimaginably hard, but then you're hoping to recruit them.\n\nI suggest you repost what you want and get specific about what you're doing in the hopes of attracting the right people. The info you posted, so far, doesn't pain an alluring image. You're struggling with money (typical, I often have to self fund), you dont seem to have an adopter, which calls into question if your idea has merit. Do you know what tech skills you need? What are you going to do for the project? If your just the idea guy, there's nothing to talk about.",

Perhaps start while you are still working and see if you like it, or if your idea can see some success.  It is alot more work of course doing it this way, but you have a fall back plan.\n\nI have seen those whom went all in, and still not out and lost great careers.\n\nIf you are thinking of SaaS or software, take everything you read on these forums and the hopium with a grain of salt.   more than 90% of these type of businesses fail or cannot make enough to even be viable living.\n\nI dabbled in creating a business a couple didn't go well, but I did it while I was working my salaried position.  Eventually I have a multitude of businesses running circling the same industry and in technology and they are doing fantastic.  I still work my job because that is my stability.

Walking away from years of career equity without proof is not brave, it’s reckless.\n\nThe safer path is boring but it works. Keep the job. Build something nights and weekends. Treat it like an experiment, not an escape plan. When the business can cover a real chunk of your living costs consistently for months, then you have leverage and choices.\n\nMost people who win didn’t jump. They transitioned. They waited until the risk was asymmetrical in their favor.\n\nYou’re not scared of failing. You’re scared of making a dumb irreversible move.

I’ve got stories about what actually happened, the good, the bad, and the stuff founders usually don’t talk about publicly.\n\nThinking weekly episodes covering things like:\n\n\t∙\tWhy I quit a comfortable corporate job\n\n\t∙\tHow I approached finding a cofounder (and what I’d do differently)\n\n\t∙\tThe pivots and challenges \n\n\t∙\tWhat web3 is actually like vs. what people think\n\n\t∙\tMistakes I made that cost us time and money\n\nMy question for you:\n\n\t1.\tWould you actually watch something like this?\n\n\t2.\tWhat topics would you most want to see covered? (Fundraising? Cofounder dynamics? Pivoting? Day-to-day reality?)\n\n\t3.\tWhat makes founder content worth your time vs. just noise?\n\nNot trying to become a YouTuber, just think there’s value in documenting the real journey while it’s happening.

      "text": "I originally posted this in on the flipping subreddit but got told it belonged here so hopefully this is the right place for this. I also want to add a disclaimer that, while I do make money off of events like concerts, plays, sports, etc. I do everything in my power to add value and I never just straight up resell tickets on their own. Ultimately I sell total event packages but I’m a big music lover so concerts are my bread and butter and on the rare occasions I can’t fill the bookings I give the tickets away for free. \n\r\nI live in a very touristy area that always has some sort of events going on and a couple of years ago I had to travel for months at a time for work. I listed my place on AirBnB and my buddy helped run it while I was away. It did fine. Nothing crazy but it was certainly nice extra cash. \n\r\nAs you’d expect, bookings often correlated with big events. So we eventually started experimenting with offering full trip packages instead of just lodging. I’d post in fan forums, Facebook groups, and occasionally relevant subreddits when a show is announced and offer a bundled option that includes:\n\r\n●\tConcert tickets\n\r\n●\tLodging at the AirBnB\n\r\n●\tTransport to/from the venue\n\r\n●\tA band T-shirt + poster\n\r\nIt ended up doing so well that when I stopped traveling I invested in a bigger place to keep it going and land larger groups. The response was significantly better than I expected, especially for weeknight shows that the Airbnb would normally be empty.\n\r\nWhat really made this work long-term is the repeat customers. People who love concerts REALLY love concerts. Once someone has a great experience, they’ll come back for another show, sometimes multiple times a year. I also keep an email list of past guests, so a lot of events sell out fast without much effort.\n\r\nOn top of that, I quietly include a few extras that I don’t advertise, just to exceed expectations:\n\r\nA framed photo from the weekend (I set up a small photo station near the entrance with an event-themed backdrop and everyone takes photos before heading out while they’re all dressed up). A welcome basket with water, ponchos, snacks, and a printed guide with venue tips + best local food and drinks. And everyone’s favorite… while guests are at the show, I prep a pile of grilled cheese sandwiches so there’s a drunk midnight snack waiting when they get back. People go absolutely nuts for it and the word of mouth has been massive.\n\r\nFrom an ops side, the biggest challenge for me was landing the actual tickets without paying insane resale markups. I organized around early access and planning. Knowing which shows were coming, when presales dropped, and which ones were actually worth building packages around. I get all of my info from venues email lists and presale sites. I used to use presalecodefinder but got sick of the ads so I switched to presale.codes. I prefer it because you can set alerts and search by location instead of just artists like most other sites.\n\r\nLike I said, I love concerts and love being able to monetize that passion while sharing it with others. While the money isn’t enough to replace my actual job, it’s been significant enough for me to rapidly increase my savings and put me on track to FIRE in the next few years… hopefully. \r\nI mainly want to know how can I expand this beyond myself? I’d love to do it full time but I feel like I’ve plateaued and I probably couldn’t run two by myself. Any advice?",

And then - it's like they switched something. A flood of similar 1-2 star reviews started. No details, template-like. Clearly the work of \"well-wishers.\"\n\nLike many, I first went the official route: polite responses, requests to real clients, endless complaints to Google support. Result - zero. The system just ignores them. These fakes are like nails hammered into the first page of search results for my name. Inquiries from new clients have dropped to almost zero. I feel completely powerless.\n\nNow I'm reading, looking for solutions. Came across information about snow monkey+block chain pr agency. A strange combination - on one hand, a monkey (probably agility and speed), on the other - blockchain (tech-savviness and transparency?). I understand I don't just need support, but \"heavy artillery\": someone who can apply legal pressure and technically \"bury\" this negativity in search results at the same time. But that's probably astronomically expensive for a small business, right? Or are there options?\n\nReally need advice from those who have already pulled their project out of such a hole.\n\nWhen did you realize you couldn't handle it on your own?\n\nDid you turn to reputation specialists? If yes, how did you choose them and what did you look for?\n\nWhat ended up working and how much time/resources did it require?\n\nThanks in advance for any response.

Google does take action about fake reviews, but it takes time because they also get flooded by other businesses attempt to take down genuine poor reviews.\n\nPoor reviews can also be drowned out by great SEO with positive actions like sponsorships, positive reviews, new blog articles, new social media posts, etc.\n\nCheckout your competitor reviews too.

Look, before you throw money at any of these companies claiming they can fix this, you need to actually verify these are fake reviews and not just pissed off customers. Document everything - timestamps, review patterns, identical language, accounts with no other activity. Then escalate with Google through their business support, not the regular report button, and be persistent as hell. If they're genuinely fake and you can prove a pattern, sometimes media attention works better than any service - local news loves this kind of story. As for those blockchain reputation whatever companies you mentioned, that sounds like buzzword soup designed to separate you from your money. Most legit reputation management is just good SEO, getting more real reviews to bury the bad ones, and legal cease and desists if you can actually prove defamation. Don't panic spend on some expensive service until you've exhausted the free options and talked to a lawyer about your actual legal options.",

Subreddits, Slack, forums, meetups. You can even host a simple mixer just to bring people in the industry together. Listen to how they describe the pain in their own words.\nResearch the builders and the money. Crunchbase helps you spot patterns fast. If you’re bold, reach out to competitors or the VCs backing them. Be honest. You’re learning the space and want to understand real challenges. It’s a reach, but when it works, it’s worth it.\n\nWatch for patterns. Especially with competitors that failed. VCs will often tell you exactly why things didn’t work.

I think it's partly to get the comfort of hearing about other people doing the same thing, and partly because I want to also be challenged and hence be able to prepare myself better for what's coming.\n\nIn March, I'll be leaving my 72K€/year job (in Spain) as a Product Manager to travel the world with my girlfriend and use a lot of the time to build products myself. I'm 28 years old and really like my job, I really do. At the same time, during the last months I have built a couple of products that get around 150 visits per month (no paid users yet), and it has been really eye-opening on how much I love doing this. I can't stop imagining myself doing this for a living. It's been hard to juggle between a demanding full-time job, social life, and building these products. I feel that if I had more mental capacity to focus on this, I could really make it.\n\nAt the same time, my girlfriend is up to traveling the world and I feel like it's now or never (I have no kids, no debts, no attachments).\n\nI have cash runway for 2–3 years, but my plan is to do this for a year, explore building products more seriously, and discover if I really want to do this full-time. Worst case, I come back to my job or find a new one (I have confidence I can find another one easily).\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share my experience and see if it resonates with someone. Any tips, challenges, will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you and happy building!",

Some were too rigid, others too generic, and most relied on “trust the process” without giving parents a real way to understand what was working.\n\nSo I decided to approach the problem differently.\n\nTogether with my sister (a midwife) and a small group of pediatricians and sleep consultants she collaborates with, I developed **PAT Sleep System** — a structured sleep training framework based on experimentation and measurement rather than a single fixed method.\n\nThe core principles:\n\t•\tno one-size-fits-all formula\n\t•\tparents test different approaches\n\t•\tresults are tracked with clear metrics\n\t•\tdecisions are driven by data\n\nThe program runs over 14 days and focuses on teaching babies how to fall asleep independently.\n\nEarly results\n\nWe launched recently, and the first outcomes are honestly very encouraging.\nBabies around 7–8 months are reaching 10–12 hours of uninterrupted night sleep.\n\nAt this stage, I’m less focused on scaling and more on refinement.\n\nWhat I’m working on now\n\t•\timproving the educational materials\n\t•\tsimplifying the framework without losing rigor\n\t•\tcollecting structured feedback from parents\n\t•\tvalidating messaging and positioning\n\nThis is the project if you’re curious it is called The Cozy Knights.\n\nI’m posting here to keep myself accountable and to learn from others who’ve built education or parenting-related businesses.\n\nIf you’ve launched:\n\t•\tdigital courses\n\t•\tevidence-based products\n\t•\tor anything in the parenting space\n\nI’d love to hear what worked (and what didn’t) in your early stages.\n\nI’ll update as things evolve.",

      "text": "I've been working for a few months now on a one-page website builder that creates uniquely designed websites for small businesses with a strong focus on three areas: conversion, good SEO principles and ease of going live. I think the product solidly delivers on all of these.\n\nFrom here on I figured outreach would be the big one right, and I feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing, and keep iterating the product based on feedback I'm getting, trying to reach people for who the product would actually be useful. I feel my issue is that it is hard to actually reach my users. I think, at least initially I should be doing it in person, but right now I'm based in the country of Georgia, where most small businesses have no interest in a website. In my home country in Belgium, it seems like businesses want to have a website, but even the easy fast do it yourself option feels too much work for most of them, so I'm having more success selling the sites all-in for a fixed price. But this also feels off, because I'm basically asking them the input manually and than still use my own tool to make the site for them, so it's hard to price it \"right\" if that makes sense?\n\nI'm now doing cold out reach through Instagram / Messenger / WhatsApp DMs to SMB owners I find on Google Maps that do not have a website yet mainly (I'm also thinking of reaching out to those who already have a website, but a bad / outdated one). The highest reply rate by far is \"Hey, I had a question, do you mind if I ask?\" <- then proceed to ask them about why they don't have a website yet (but this feels like \"tricking\" them, which I don't like). Other outreach approaches seem to have a very low reply rate (I tried short / long / introducing me in detail / not doing that / reaching out with the a free preview offer and than having the option for them to continue building it / have an offer to do it all-in and handle everything for them (of course at a higher price point). But all of those seem to have a very very low reply rate (like less than 5%).\n\nSo I'm wondering looking at competitors like Wix, Squarespace, Durable who have all been able to scale to millions of users, why it's so hard for me to find even one paying user for a product a feel addresses quite a few of the pain points that SMB owners are talking about when using those services. What am I doing wrong? How do you think I should find users for what I have build? Should I just focus on doing the all-in websites (at least initially) as those pay the bills?",

What you are seeing suggests people are willing to pay more to make a problem disappear (than to learn a better way to handle it themselves). Especially smb owners.\n\nWhen someone pays more specifically to not be involved, that tells you something.   \nThey’re not really buying a website, they are buying relief from having to think about websites at all.\n\nThat doesn’t mean your tool or initial idea is wrong. It may just mean the first buyer isn’t the DIY user you imagined, but someone who wants the outcome without the cognitive overhead. a lot of successful software products started as services for exactly this reason.\n\nIt might help to stop asking why won’t they use the tool and instead ask who actually wants this problem off their plate, and when. Those are very different buyers.\n\nIf you zoom out for a moment, do you want the next phase to buy you validation that the tool works, or clarity about who truly wants to own this problem themselves?",

That's not a marketing problem, that's market feedback telling you what they actually value.\n\nThe small businesses you're targeting don't want another tool to learn. They want the website to exist without them thinking about it. Wix and Squarespace scaled with tens of millions in marketing spend and years of brand building, comparing yourself to them is pointless. They also target a different user, someone who actually wants to build their own site.\n\nThe \"tricking\" feeling about your opener is misplaced. Asking someone why they don't have a website isn't manipulation, it's genuine curiosity about their situation. That's just sales.\n\nWith our clients doing productized services the ones who succeed fastest stop fighting what customers are buying. If done-for-you at a fixed price is closing, do that. Price it based on the value of a working website to them, not based on how long it takes you. If your tool lets you build sites in 2 hours that would take someone else 10 hours, that efficiency is your margin.\n\nRun the productized service for 6-12 months, learn what these customers actually need, then decide if the DIY tool still makes sense. Revenue now beats theoretical SaaS scale later.",

      "text": "I've been thinking about this a lot lately after watching three colleagues nearly lose their businesses to administrative issues that had nothing to do with their actual business performance.\n\nWe've made business formation incredibly accessible - and that's great. You can file an LLC online in under an hour for less than $200 in most states. Every guru on YouTube and TikTok is selling courses on \"how to start your business TODAY\" and it's never been easier to become official.\n\nBut formation is maybe 5% of the actual administrative work.\n\nWhat comes after is this ongoing maze of compliance requirements that most first-time business owners have zero awareness of. Annual reports. Biennial statements. Franchise taxes. BOI filings. Business licenses at city, county, and state levels. Registered agent requirements. Good standing certificates.\n\nAnd here's the kicker - the penalties for missing these aren't proportional to the complexity. A $50 annual report you didn't know existed can result in dissolution of your business. Your LLC status can go from \"active\" to \"delinquent\" while you're busy actually running the company and generating revenue.\n\nI've seen people lose contracts because they couldn't produce a certificate of good standing on demand. I know someone who had their business involuntarily dissolved because compliance notices went to an old address.\n\nThe infrastructure exists to help with this - InCorp as registered agent to handle the ongoing compliance tracking - but most new business owners don't even know this is something they should be budgeting for until they've already missed something critical.\n\nWhy isn't this part of the conversation? Why do we celebrate making formation easy but completely ignore the fact that we're setting people up to fail on the backend?\n\nThoughts?",

One page with: exact legal name, state ID number, registered agent, tax year, deadlines for annual report/franchise tax/BOI, plus links to the state SOS search and local licensing portals. Then:\n1) Put every deadline in a shared calendar with 60/30/7-day reminders.\n2) Use a service that actually explains your obligations in plain English (Northwest for RA, Stripe Atlas for Delaware + early-stage, and doola for non-US founders who need EIN/banking/compliance guardrails instead of just one-off filings).\n3) Once a quarter, spend 30 minutes doing a “good standing” check: state site, RA messages, IRS letters.\nThe main point is compliance should be treated like payroll: invisible, scheduled, and never a surprise.",

It won't.\n\nI wasted 6 months building shit nobody asked for before I realized something - as a solo founder stuck at $0, your problem isn't your product. It's everything else. Here's exactly what changed:\n\n**1. I Stopped \"Building\" and Started Talking**\n\nBig mistake: I spent 5 months coding in isolation thinking \"build it and they will come.\"\n\nThey didn't come.\n\nThen I forced myself to do something uncomfortable - I started cold messaging 50 people on LinkedIn every single day. Not copy-paste spam. Actually personalized messages to people who engage with top posts in my niche.\n\nResponse rate: 15-20%.\n\nThese people told me what they actually wanted. \n\nYour obsession with coding is just avoiding rejection.\n\n**2. Fuck Your Feature List**\n\nThis one hurt but... I deleted 7 features I spent weeks building.\n\nTurned out 3% of users ever clicked on them.\n\nStripped everything down to ONE thing: AI content that sounds like you, not ChatGPT.\n\nMade that 10x better instead of adding more mediocre features.\n\nYour feature bloat is killing you. Pick one thing and make it unfairly good.\n\n**3. The Pricing Move That Felt Insane**\n\nStarted at $19/month to \"compete\" with bigger tools at $39.\n\nConversion rate: 6%.\n\nThen I did something that felt stupid - raised it to $29/month.\n\nConversions went UP to 11%.\n\nPlus the customers who complained about the $10 difference:  \n  \nThey were going to be nightmare support tickets anyway.\n\nStop racing to the bottom.   \n  \nYour low price isn't helping you.\n\n**4. Reddit Became My Unfair Advantage**\n\nWhile everyone's trying to hack the algorithm on X, I did the most unsexy thing possible...\n\nWrote ONE valuable post per day on Reddit.   \n  \nNo promo links in the post. (Just let people ask)\n\nOne post drove 50+ qualified visitors. That's more than weeks of \"viral\" tweets with 50k impressions ever did.\n\nNow I repurpose that one post across 5-10 relevant subreddits.\n\nCost: $0. Time: 60 minutes per day.\n\n**5. SEO But Make It Actually Smart**\n\nEveryone told me: \"Write about LinkedIn growth tips!\"\n\nCool, I'd be competing with HubSpot, Neil Patel, and every marketing blog with DA 80+.\n\nI'd never rank.\n\nSo I went bottom-of-funnel instead:\n\n* \"Brandled vs \\[competitor\\]\" comparison pages\n* \"Best \\[competitor\\] alternatives\"\n* \"\\[competitor\\] review\"\n\nThese get 50-200 searches per month. But everyone searching is ready to buy.\n\nAnd I can actually rank for them.\n\nOne comparison page drives more revenue than 10 \"tips and tricks\" articles ever did.\n\n**6. I Stopped Pretending to Be a Big Company**\n\n**The Solo Founder's Actual Edge**\n\nYou can't outspend funded competitors. You can't out-hire them. You can't out-build them.\n\nBut you can out-care them.\n\nEvery customer gets a personal response from me. Every feature request gets a Loom video (even if it's a \"no\"). Every cancelled user gets a real email asking what I could've done better.\n\nBig companies can't do this. Their support team doesn't even know their founder.\n\nYou ARE the founder. That's your moat.\n\n**Why I Almost Quit (And Why You Shouldn't)**\n\nMonth 3: $0. Thought about quitting. Month 4: $0. Definitely thought about quitting. Month 5: $0. Wrote my \"I'm shutting down\" post. Month 6: Changed everything. Hit $126 in 4 days.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you: most founders quit right before things work.\n\nNot because their idea was bad. Because they ran out of patience.\n\nThe difference between $0 and $126 isn't talent. It's just refusing to quit when everything feels pointless.\n\n**The Truth About \"Making It\"**\n\nI'm not at $20k MRR. I'm not at $10k. I'm at $126.\n\nBut you know what? I went from \"this will never work\" to \"holy shit, people are actually paying me.\"\n\nThat mental shift is worth more than the money.\n\nBecause now I know the model works. Now it's just about repetition.\n\nKeep doing outreach. Keep writing content. Keep talking to users. Keep shipping.\n\n$126 becomes $500. $500 becomes $2k. $2k becomes $10k.\n\nBut only if you don't quit at $0.\n\nLook, I'm not some guru. I'm just a solo founder who wasted 6 months doing everything wrong.\n\nBut if you're stuck at $0 like I was, maybe my mistakes can save you some time.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share more details.\n\n(And yeah, the tool is Brandled - helps founders grow on LinkedIn & X without sounding like ChatGPT. But more importantly: just keep building. Most people quit right before it works.)",

If you're a solo founder who's also a software developer, it's so easy to get caught up with code and features, and often times it's the only thing I want to do - which is OK, because that's the way you finish something. I am currently in the validation stage for the product I recently built. I still don't have customers, but I decided I am not building anymore features until I find the people who are meant to use this tool. I created a first version, published it and now I am looking for people and teams on LinkedIn that might be interested (not just in buying, but in collaboration, giving feedback etc.). Each day I connect with 10-20 niche profiles, and as I do that, more and more suggestions and connections are coming along. \n\nSo you are 100% right: we do need to stop building for a while, and do the \"uncomfortable\" thing which is communicating, getting feedback, getting ourselves out there, become visible. As soon as I realized this, the process started becoming natural and comfortable.",

Three main things to understand: 1) “Being your own boss” is not a good thing at all — for me, I personally have no choice but to be my own boss because I am so incompetent that I cannot rely on being employed elsewhere. 2) ideas do NOT matter, execution does. 3) Digital spaces are saturated, awful places to start if you have no experience — get into a physical, labor based business like a trade if you want quick, reliable cash while learning a skill. \n\nWith that said, the most important thing is to not overthink, but also to not spend money ever if you can. Don’t “overinvest” in yourself, you should have the mentality that most expenses are based on scams unless they are returnable tools or things that produce immediate, safe turnaround. Don’t buy courses — if you do this, you probably have way too much to learn about real life first before starting a business and should hyperfocus on getting some street smarts. Last, never work with partners unless you take the time to understand how a corporate structure works — ie. how taxes, private loans, payouts, and salaries are different than ownership % and dividends. If you don’t understand this concept, you have NO business trying to run a business with someone else who owns even 1%",

I’m technically solid: servers, hosting, networking. As a hobby i started web development (Frontend + Backend), built a lot of pages and apps (more fun than business). \n\nBuilding and running things isn’t the issue for me. I want to get out of employment and move toward self-employment. Not because I’m chasing some magic business model or overnight success. I know that doesn’t exist.\n\nBoth of my parents were entrepreneurs as well (different industry, not for me), so I grew up around that mindset. I’m not afraid of hard work, long hours, or slow progress. I just want to build something of my own that actually makes sense.\n\nWhat I’m really after is learning how to identify real niches and real customer problems, and then build products or services that solve those problems and people are willing to pay for. Not once, but repeatedly.\n\nMy current thinking: Focus first on marketing and understanding demand\n\n→ learn how people think, decide, and buy\n→ then build the right product on top of that\n\nNot the other way around.\n\nI’m starting to seriously study marketing and neuromarketing because I want to understand the mechanics, not just copy tactics. I genuinely enjoy these topics and want to develop the skillset to independently find problems, validate them, and build solutions.\n\nSo my questions:\nDoes this order of learning and execution make sense?\nWhat parts of marketing matter most early on for solo founders?\nWhere do technical people like me usually mess this up?\n\nI’m not looking for shortcuts or hype. I’m looking for honest experiences and lessons learned.\n\nAppreciate any input. 🙏",

Your approach totally makes sense: learn what people need first to build solutions second. Most tech founders do the opposite and waste months building something nobody really wants. If you’re starting solo, here’s what I’d focus on early: Talk to people / validate pain points – literally watch them struggle and see if they’d actually pay for a fix. Make your value super clear – can you explain in one sentence why someone should care? If not, hold off building. Run tiny tests – landing pages, surveys, pre-orders, small ad experiments. Quick feedback more important building the full thing. Figure out where your audience hangs out – forums, Discord, Reddit, LinkedIn and test messaging there. Tech people often slip up by overbuilding, adding stuff no one asked for, focusing on nice-to-have instead of must-have, or forgetting that even the best solution fails if it’s hard to find or buy. \n\nHonestly, if you combine your technical skills with really understanding what people want and quick experiments, you’ll avoid most rookie mistakes. What kind of problem or niche are you most interested in exploring first? That’ll help you figure out which marketing pieces to learn first.",

          "text": "This is actually a smart reset, not a downgrade you’re removing ego, sunk-cost bias, and burnout from the equation. A few high-leverage thoughts that might help you get real signal faster with this approach: First, free is fine only if you’re testing the right thing. Page views vs downloads tells you interest, but it doesn’t tell you value. One simple tweak that keeps things lightweight: ask for a tiny commitment before download. Even something like “enter an email to get updates / next version” or a “pay what you want (including $0)” option. People who bother are already a different class of signal. Second, static/offline tools are perfect for sharp, single-pain use cases. The ones that tend to spread are not “productivity tools” but “I built this because I was annoyed by X.” When you post, lead with the irritation, not the tool. People don’t share tools, they share relief. Third, usage more important then downloads is the real boss metric, but it’s invisible unless you design for it. Since you’re offline/no backend, consider baking in something like: a visible “session count” the user sees themselves or a very obvious “did this help?” prompt with a one-click feedback link. It sounds small, but it turns passive users into active signal. Fourth, Gumroad is not just a checkout, it’s a filter. Even when you switch to paid, pricing at $3–$7 will tell you more than free ever will. If someone won’t pay the price of a coffee to remove a real annoyance, the problem probably isn’t strong enough. Two questions that’ll help sharpen the next iteration: What specific moment or frustration made you build this tool for yourself? If this tool disappeared tomorrow, what would you personally be most annoyed to lose? Those answers usually point directly to the version people will actually use and pay for.",

      "text": "Hey, I went into SaaS last year with my tool Brandled (helps founders grow on X & LinkedIn) in a pretty competitive space with $0 and 0 audience and ended up wasting six months straight on the wrong things.\n\n\n\nSpent half a year stuck at $0 MRR before I figured out what actually matters.\n\n\n\nHere's everything I learned the hard way. Wish someone had told me this on day one.\n\n\n\n1. Offer Google/social login. Seriously.\n\n\n\nI started with the magic link only. (cause i adopted ship fast mentality on the wrong things)\n\n\n\nMy signup completion rate was 45%.\n\n\n\nAdded Google OAuth. It jumped to 78% overnight.\n\n\n\nFriction at signup is invisible revenue loss. Every extra step costs you 20-30% of potential users.\n\n\n\nTakes like 1 hour to implement. \n\n\n\n2. Post-launch is 80% marketing, 20% product. Maybe even 90/10.\n\n\n\nI spent 3 months building features.\n\n\n\nThen I \"launched.\"\n\n\n\nGot 12 signups. 0 paying customer.\n\n\n\nI thought: \"The product isn't good enough yet. Let me add more features.\"\n\n\n\nSpent another week building.\n\n\n\nBut still got no results.\n\n\n\nThe problem wasn't my product. The problem was nobody knew it existed.\n\n\n\nHere's the truth: your product only needs to solve ONE problem well. That's it. Everything else is marketing.\n\n\n\nI know founders with worse products than mine making $50k MRR because they're good at marketing.\n\n\n\nI know founders with better products than mine making $0 because they suck at marketing.\n\n\n\nPost-launch, you should spend 80% of your time getting eyeballs on your product and 20% improving it based on paying customer feedback.\n\n\n\nNot the other way around.\n\n\n\n3. Market shamelessly. Talk about your product everywhere.\n\n\n\nI was terrified of being \"salesy.\"\n\n\n\nSo I'd post about \"building in public\" but never actually mention my product.\n\n\n\nI'd write valuable content on Reddit but never link to my tool.\n\n\n\nSo I was staring $0 MRR every day.\n\n\n\nThen I started being shameless and mentioning my product everywhere.\n\n\n\nNobody will discover your product by accident. You have to put it in their face. Repeatedly.\n\n\n\nThe people who get offended by promotion weren't going to buy anyway.\n\n\n\n4. Respect the ones who churn. They're giving you honest feedback.\n\n\n\nWhen users churn, I used to feel rejected.\n\n\n\nNow I have an automated email that asks: \"What made you unsubscribe?\"\n\n\n\nThe responses are gold.\n\n\n\nA lot of times, I was able to get them back by just guiding them or fixing some minor issue in the tool.\n\n\n\n5. Use your own product every single day. Not once a week. Every. Day.\n\n\n\nI built Brandled but wasn't using it consistently for my own content.\n\n\n\nOne day I forced myself to use it like a real user would.\n\n\n\nFound 7 bugs in 30 minutes. Things I never noticed in testing.\n\n\n\nMy users were experiencing all of this and not telling me. They were just leaving.\n\n\n\nNow I use Brandled for everything.\n\n\n\nI catch problems before my users do. And I understand their workflow because I live it.\n\n\n\nIf you're not using your own product daily, you're building blind.\n\n\n\n6. Retention > acquisition.\n\n\n\nI was obsessed with getting new signups.\n\n\n\nRan ads. Did outreach. Posted everywhere.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, my churn rate was 40% per month.\n\n\n\nI'd get 10 new customers and lose 4 old ones.\n\n\n\nNet growth: 6.\n\n\n\nI was filling a leaky bucket.\n\n\n\nThen I focused on retention:\n\n\n\nFixed onboarding\n\n\n\nAdded email sequences to keep users engaged\n\n\n\nBuilt features existing customers actually asked for\n\n\n\nChecked in with users who went quiet\n\n\n\nChurn dropped to 15%.\n\n\n\nNow when I get 10 new customers, I only lose 2-3.\n\n\n\nNet growth: 7-8.\n\n\n\nSame marketing effort, but better results.\n\n\n\n7. Your MVP should only have the must-haves. Actually stick to MoSCoW.\n\n\n\nI know everyone says this. But I didn't listen.\n\n\n\nMy \"MVP\" had:\n\n\n\nContent generation\n\n\n\nAnalytics dashboard\n\n\n\nPost scheduling\n\n\n\nCompetitor tracking\n\n\n\nSWOT analysis\n\n\n\nComment assistant\n\n\n\nHashtag research\n\n\n\nThat's not an MVP.\n\n\n\nI should've launched with ONE feature: AI content generation that sounds like you.\n\n\n\nThat's it.\n\n\n\nEverything else should've come after people paid for that one thing.\n\n\n\nHere's how MoSCoW actually works:\n\n\n\nMust have: The ONE thing that solves the core problem\n\n\n\nShould have: Stuff you add after the first 10 paying customers ask for it\n\n\n\nCould have: Nice-to-haves that you build if you have extra time (you won't)\n\n\n\nWon't have: Everything else (most of your ideas belong here)\n\n\n\nYour MVP should make people go \"holy shit, this solves my problem\" even if it's ugly and missing features.\n\n\n\nNot \"wow, this has so many features\" while not solving anything particularly well.\n\n\n\n8. Price based on value, not competition.\n\n\n\nI looked at my competitors:\n\n\n\nTaplio: $39/month\n\n\n\nSuperX: $29/month\n\n\n\nHypefury: $29/month\n\n\n\nI priced Brandled at $19/month to \"undercut the market.\"\n\n\n\nBig mistake.\n\n\n\nLow price signals low value. People assumed I was inferior.\n\n\n\nPlus, at $19/month, I needed 263 customers to hit $5k MRR.\n\n\n\nAt $39/month, I need 128.\n\n\n\nHalf the customers for the same revenue.\n\n\n\nThen I realized: my tool saves people 10+ hours per week. That's worth $500-$700/month atleast for most founders.\n\n\n\nI wasn't competing on price. I was competing on value.\n\n\n\nRaised my price to $29/month - $39/month. Conversions actually IMPROVED.\n\n\n\nBecause the people who care about $10 differences aren't your best customers anyway.\n\n\n\nYour best customers care about results, not price.\n\n\n\nPrice for the value you deliver, not for what your competitors charge.\n\n\n\nThe Truth Most SaaS Founders Don't Want to Hear:\n\n\n\nMost SaaS founders don't fail because of bad ideas.\n\n\n\nThey fail because they give up too early.\n\n\n\n90% of SaaS products are gone within 2 years.\n\n\n\nNot because they couldn't work.\n\n\n\nBecause the founder quit before they figured out what works.\n\n\n\nI almost quit at month 5. I was depressed. Burnt out. Convinced I was wasting my time.\n\n\n\nThen I changed my approach and hit $126 MRR in 4 days.\n\n\n\nStill small. But it's proof the model works.\n\n\n\nNow it's just about staying consistent and not quitting when shit gets hard (which it will).\n\n\n\nHere's my commitment:\n\n\n\nI'm building this to $10k MRR minimum. No matter how long it takes.\n\n\n\nI'm documenting everything on X and LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nNot the highlight reel. The real shit. The mistakes. The failures. The small wins.\n\n\n\nIf you're building something, my advice: stay in the game.\n\n\n\nMost people quit right before things start working.\n\n\n\nDon't be most people.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer questions or share more details on any of this.",

A lot of founders convince themselves they’re being “responsible” when they’re really just avoiding the uncomfortable stuff.\n\nOne thing I don’t see talked about enough is how easy it is to forget why decisions were made in the first place. You fix onboarding, tweak pricing, change positioning, then six months later you’re questioning everything again. Keeping that reasoning around matters. I’ve started being more intentional about capturing context, not just metrics. Notion helps, but I’ve also used Sensay as a low effort way to preserve those lessons so I don’t relearn them every cycle.\n\nRespect for sticking it out and being honest about the ugly parts. Most people quit right before the pattern becomes obvious.",

      "text": "I enjoyed dining at a popular and very successful Chinese restaurant.  \nOne day, I heard that the owners (A guy, his sister, and her husband) had a huge disagreement and decided to go their separate ways.\n\nThe guy stayed with the original restaurant.\n\nHis sister opened another restaurant in a different town and named it after herself.\n\nHer ex-husband opened his own restaurant on the same block as his ex-wife.\n\nEven the head Chef left and opened his own restaurant in another town.\n\nAll four of them were massively successful within the first year of opening, even though they all had different branding and different customers.\n\nIn other words, all they had was their knowledge - the playbook that made the original restaurant successful. This most likely included items such as recipes, suppliers, business processes, and je ne sais quoi.\n\nI've seen many restaurant owners fail, yet those four succeeded because, in their minds, they weren't starting from scratch; they were reclaiming their previous victory.\n\nThis gave me an idea. You've probably heard about Manifestation. The type of Manifestation I think most credible is through In-Depth Acting. i.e., Act as if your desire had already been achieved. It does two things:\n\n1. It implants a muscle memory into your subconscious\n2. It gets your subconscious comfortable with the new environment and overwrites old habits\n\nThe hardest part of the journey is getting your hands on a detailed playbook that lets you act as if you already own the desired goal that you want to manifest.\n\nEvery day, act as if you already own and operate that successful business. From doing fake marketing to fake sales calls. Managing a fake team, etc.\n\nDon't think of it as \"faking it\" or \"manifestation,\" think of it as practice. Practice has a better ring to it because it suggests you're getting better at it. You practice a musical instrument or sport and get better.\n\nPractice would also outperform reading a book, watching a video, or taking a course, just as playing golf would outperform reading about playing golf.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Plutôt que d’augmenter le volume, on a d’abord travaillé sur la structure.\n\nOn a combiné quelques outils simples comme Lemlist pour les séquences, PhantomBuster pour l’extraction de données, et HubSpot comme CRM léger. Rien de très sophistiqué. L’impact est surtout venu d’un meilleur ciblage, de données plus propres et de responsabilités claires sur les relances.\n\nLes résultats n’ont pas été spectaculaires, mais surtout plus stables. Des taux de réponse plus réguliers, moins de leads perdus, et plus de temps pour améliorer les messages plutôt que faire du répétitif.\n\nConclusion perso: les outils aident, mais seulement quand le process est clair.
