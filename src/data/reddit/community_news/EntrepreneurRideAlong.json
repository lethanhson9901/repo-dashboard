          "text": "Oh we definitely did and still pay monthly for most of the agents we use tbh! I just looked at our billing dashboard and here are the ones that stood out:\n\n1. Gamma: Great for automating making presentations! Gamma created a fully designed presentation for me (including all the content) from a one line prompt in 90 seconds. This was damn impressive!   \n2. Windsurf/Cursor: Everyone in our team gets either Windsurf or Cursor, which has literally tripled our developer output. We ship products much faster now. Personally I am huge fan of Windsurf Cascade agent that as been able to pull off large changes to our production app from a single prompt! But some prefer Cursor!  \n3. Lovable/Bolt: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff!  \n4. Frizerly: I have an automation using Frizerly AI agent that pulls all our Google search console data, and comes up with a strategy for blogs on our website based on last months changes and current strategy. It then auto publishes a blog daily on our wordpress website! It can also generate and publish instagram posts weekly using our exact product images that mostly involves educational content! \n5. Clay: We have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point.\n6. Google Nano Banana: Google Nano Banana has been a game changer in helping us create marketing assets from scratch with simple product images. It can easily turn simple images to full blown product shoots!  \n\n \n\nWould love to learn what others are paying for as well!",

That is the textbook definition of Circumventing Systems.\n\nOnce you trigger a 'Circumventing' ban, your domain name and payment profile are blacklisted forever. Google tracks digital fingerprints way beyond just your IP (browser canvas, payment hash, domain WHOIS history). A VPN will not save you.\n\nTo the OP: The 'Unverifiable Location' suspension usually happens because of a mismatch between three points:\n\n\\- Your Payment Profile (Is the credit card billing address in Wyoming or Europe?)\n\n\\- Your Website Footer (Does it list the Registered Agent address exactly?)\n\n\\- Your 'About Us' page (Does it honestly say 'US HQ with EU team'?)\n\nGoogle requires consistency. If your site looks anonymous or hides your location, their Trust Safety bot flags it.\n\nI build compliance scanners (called Merchant Risk Radar) to detect these exact 'Identity Mismatches' on storefronts. Before you appeal, make sure your website's footer address matches your Google Ads Verification documents character-for-character. Then appeal with: \"We are a US LLC with remote operations.\" Transparency fixes this, hiding via VPN makes it fatal.",

      "text": "I wasted like $2k on lead lists before I figured this out. Posting in case anyone else is burning money the same way I was.\n\nBackground: bootstrapped b2b saas, tiny budget, couldn't afford SDRs. Was doing all outbound myself.\n\nBought lists from apollo, clearbit, zoominfo trials, you name it. Response rates were embarrassing. Like 1-2%. Started thinking outbound just \"doesn't work for our space.\"\n\nThen I had a dumb realization that honestly should've been obvious way sooner.\n\n**The people I want to sell to are already telling me who they are.**\n\nThey're following my competitors on linkedin.\n\nThey're commenting on posts about the exact problem I solve.\n\nThey're engaging with content in my niche every single day.\n\nWhy am I paying for some scraped list of \"CMOs in the US\" when I can just... look at who's actively interested in my space?\n\n**What I started doing:**\n\n1) Found the 5 biggest competitors in my space. Looked at their linkedin company page followers. Filtered by job title. These people literally followed a company that does what I do. They're not cold.\n\n2) Found \\~10 people who post content about my problem space. Looked at who's commenting and engaging. These people are self-identifying as caring about this topic.\n\nThen I just reached out. Super simple message like \"saw you engage with \\[x\\]'s post about \\[topic\\], working on something related, thought you might have thoughts\"\n\n**What changed:**\n\nOld way (bought lists): \\~2% reply rate, most replies were \"not interested\" or \"remove me\"\n\nNew way: 35-40% reply rate, and these people actually want to talk because they're already thinking about this stuff\n\nWent from mass outreach to like 30-40 hyper targeted messages per week. Way less volume but 10x the results.\n\n**The boring logistics part:**\n\nYou can do this manually (I did for the first few weeks, it sucked). There's some tools that scrape linkedin engagers - I've tried a few, won't shill any specific ones here but just google \"linkedin engagement scraper\" and you'll find options. Some let you automate the outreach too which saves time.\n\nMain point isn't the tools though. It's the mindset shift.\n\nStop trying to find people who MIGHT be interested.\n\nStart finding people who already ARE interested.\n\nThey're right there. Engaging with your competitors. Commenting on relevant content. Following pages in your space.",

      "text": "Started this whole thing in May 2025 because I was burnt out from my consulting gig and wanted something that could run without me being on camera every day. I'm not camera shy exactly, but the idea of filming myself three times a week while also working full time felt exhausting.\n\nThe niche I picked was personal finance for millennials. Saturated? Absolutely. But I figured the content quality bar was still pretty low for faceless channels in that space.\n\nFirst three months were rough. I was using stock footage, basic text animations, and AI voiceover. The videos looked like every other generic finance channel. Growth was basically flat at around 200 subs after posting 25 videos. CPM was decent when I finally got monetized but views were trash so it didn't matter.\n\nThe turning point came when I started thinking about the channel like a character, not just a content machine. I needed a consistent visual identity that wasn't just random stock clips of people typing on laptops.\n\nI experimented with a bunch of different approaches. Tried Midjourney for creating a recurring \"host\" character but the face consistency was all over the place. One video she'd look 25, next video she'd look 40 with completely different bone structure. Looked amateur.\n\nEnded up testing several AI portrait tools. Played around with Artflow, tried the character training on Leonardo, messed with APOB, and a few others I found on Product Hunt. Each had tradeoffs. Some were great at realism but terrible at keeping the same face across generations. Others were consistent but the output looked obviously AI.\n\nWhat finally worked was building out a proper system. I created a character bible with reference images, specific lighting preferences, and a list of expressions that matched different video topics. Took maybe two weeks of iteration but once I had that dialed in, production speed went through the roof.\n\nNow I batch create all my thumbnail and B roll images in one session. Usually takes about 3 hours to generate enough visual assets for 8 to 10 videos. Compare that to the 6+ hours I used to spend hunting for relevant stock footage that wouldn't get me a copyright strike.\n\nThe numbers since making the switch:\n\nMonth 4 to 6: Averaged 2,100 views per video\n\nMonth 7 to 8: Averaging 8,400 views per video\n\nCurrent subscriber count: 4,200\n\nRevenue last month: $847\n\nNot life changing money but the trend line is what matters. And more importantly, I'm actually enjoying the process now instead of dreading every upload.\n\nBiggest lessons from this whole experiment:\n\nConsistency in visual branding matters way more than I thought for faceless channels. Viewers subconsciously recognize your style and it builds trust even without a real human face.\n\nThe tech is good enough now that you don't need to be a designer or spend hours in Photoshop. But you do need to put in upfront work defining what you want before you start generating stuff randomly.\n\nStock footage channels are going to struggle more and more. The bar for \"professional looking\" keeps rising and audiences can tell when you're just slapping generic clips over a script.\n\nStill figuring out the best approach for scaling to a second channel in a different niche. The workflow I built is pretty transferable but picking the right topic is the hard part.",

I wanted to make sure that my family didn't pay the price. So I worked my schedule around them. That meant once everyone was in bed asleep.I got up and I would work for a few hours every night. Then, I would get up very early in the morning to work.And prepare breakfast before leaving for work.\n\nEarly on I found the power list created by Andy Frisella.\n\nOnce the business had traction, and I was working it full time in late year 3 i started making my list of five action items to do every day. That list can be personal family or business. And usually as a combination of all three.\n\nWhen i've knocked out my five things for the day, then i've won the day and I can choose what to do with the rest of my time.\n\nIn year ten now, currently that's how I live. I sleep until I wake up. I have breakfast with my family every morning. Then I start my day. I'm usually home in the late afternoon.\n\nThere are seasons where things are busier. I have a huge inventory order arriving tomorrow. So today i'm preparing everything in the warehouse to receive it. Once it arrives, I will check everything in and stock it on the shelves. Then, I'll fill all the back orders that i've acquired. Ship out any new first orders for the day.And onboard any new customers. Then I'll go home. \n\nBut I understand that tomorrow might be a fifteen hour day or longer. I will work until the job is done. Because if not, it would make the next day harder.\n\nThe big thing is, if you have something that needs to get done, you finish it. If tomorrow is going to be a very long day. Then, I will probably have breakfast with the family and I will come home for dinner and play with my children.And hang out with my wife until they're all in bed.And then I'll come back up to the warehouse and work all night if I have to. My family won't know because I will be there cooking breakfast in the morning.",

It's not really that it's a day-to-day grind, because if you're pushing hard through work that feels terrible, then the work you're creating is probably terrible too.\n\nI think the two big things I've learned about the software businesses are:\n\n1. That it's about education rather than 'hard work'. Building expertise is the part that takes a long time. Once you know how to do something, doing it is trivial, but if you don't know how to do something, no amount of hard work will help you until you do.\n\n2. That the difficult part is like an ultra-marathon, not like a sprint. It's really hard, but not in the sense that you're pushing yourself to the absolute max for a month - more like you have to sustain a good pace for years and not quit, even when some moments are hard. If you sprint, you just burn yourself out, and the whole thing ends up taking longer. Patience is more important than speed.\n\nThe more you can get to be great at what you do through really challenging real-world side projects or realistic experience before starting a business, the better. I probably should have done more of that before starting my business, but I guess learning the hard way is better than not learning at all.",

There was the original concern and rush to get out there, meet with everyone, and constantly learning new shit I needed to do. Year two I was able to hire a bookkeeping service which cut out 4 days of busywork a month. Every Friday was my catch up on books day and a bookkeeper could do it in a tenth that time, so hiring out was amazing. I also brought on a partner who needed support all the time at first, so that was a lot. I also was always bumpy on cash flow. It was stressful going from having 50K in the business checking to needing to hold off on paying ourselves because of cash flow. High growth does that. \n\nSince October though, I’ve really slowed down my sales grind and things keep coming my way, I have a reoccurring revenue so I’m really set so long as I don’t start suddenly losing business, and if I keep adding, I need to hire soon. I’m paying myself around 200K, so that’s nice, and my business checking has been in the lower 6 figures all year. \n\nI honestly thought it would take at least another 1-2 years to get to this point, definitely was not expecting by end of year 1 to be stable, end of year two to be making more, and looking ahead, I may need to hire this year.",

I really don’t want fake clicks or bots that bounce immediately, so I want real website traffic. I’m hoping to find something that sends visitors who look natural, browse my website, and show up properly in analytics, since that is important for getting approved by ad networks.\n\nIt also matters to me that I can buy traffic and have an option to choose visitor locations, and that the traffic arrives gradually instead of flooding in all at once, so it keeps looking realistic. If anyone has tested a site that held up long term without causing penalties or strange ranking drops, I’d really appreciate any recommendations.",

He found this expensive vendor that guaranteed residential ips and lengthy session durations which sounded perfect on paper. We watched the real time analytics and sure enough the users were coming in from different cities and scrolling down the pages. But then we looked closer at the heatmaps and realized every single user moved their mouse in the exact same pattern before leaving. The investor pulled out after their tech team audited the logs, and my client lost the deal plus the 5k he spent on the package.",

You might see the numbers go up in your analytics for a few days and feel good about it, yet the ad networks have very sophisticated ways of spotting patterns that look unnatural. If you care about the long term health of your domain, you should probably stay away from purchasing visitors completely. It is much safer to focus on creating content that people actually search for, because once you get flagged for invalid activity, it is nearly impossible to get your reputation back with the big networks.",

That number isn’t impressive by startup-Twitter standards, but it covers my devops costs, AI tools, and about half of my car payment. More importantly, it’s stable and still growing month over month.   \n  \nWhat surprised me most is that none of this came from TikTok hype, Instagram reels, or viral launches. No big audience. No “growth hacks.” Just a boring combination of shipping consistently, fixing UX friction, listening to user complaints, and iterating for months.  \n  \nPeople keep saying the app market is dead, SaaS is saturated, hardware is impossible, etc. From what I’m seeing, that’s mostly noise. Revenue still compounds if you keep improving something real. Whether you’re building a mobile app, a SaaS, or even a physical product: if users are getting value and you keep showing up, the curve eventually bends upward. It’s not glamorous, but it works.\n\nI’m still iterating on my app daily, and I expect it to keep growing and not because of hype, but because people actually use it.\n\n**If you’re in a slump right now: don’t stop.

I do have some third party experience of this (and was nosy enough to ask how they sorted it) so hope it helps.\n\nTrampoline parks sit in a small, specialist insurance category. Most retail agents literally cannot place the risk, so they either say no immediately or throw out a defensive quote hoping you go away. That’s why the numbers feel insane.\n\nAt this point, stop calling general insurance agents.\n\nYou want brokers who already place cover for high risk leisure venues. Trampoline parks, indoor climbing, zip lines, karting, adventure parks. When you speak to them, don’t frame the conversation as “can you insure my trampoline park?”. Instead, position it as “we are opening an indoor leisure venue, equipment installed, safety systems documented, waivers in place, and we are finalising our insurer”. That signals legitimacy and that you’re already past the idea stage.\n\nOn your questions, yes, £70K plus a year is unfortunately not unusual in year one for trampoline parks. It often comes down once you’ve operated safely for a period of time. Waivers help, but they don’t replace proper liability insurance. Extra cover on top of your main policy is common in this industry, but it should be there to protect against worst-case scenarios, not sold to you out of fear.\n\nThe fastest unlock is finding a broker who already has trampoline parks on their books. Ask them directly how many similar venues they insure. If the answer is zero, move on.\n\nA quick AI search gave me:\n\n* **RPS (Risk Placement Services)** Large wholesale broker with a dedicated entertainment and leisure practice. Many retail agents place trampoline risks through them.\n* **AmWINS** One of the biggest specialty wholesalers in the US. They regularly place coverage for indoor amusement, family entertainment centres, and extreme sports.\n* **CRC Group** Another major wholesale broker that places difficult liability risks, including trampoline parks and adventure venues\n\nHope that steadies things a bit, and good luck with the venture",

In high-risk operations like trampoline parks, insurance isn’t a box you check at the end, it’s the thing that determines whether the business is even viable. If you can’t get coverage at a price the numbers can support, the rest of the plan doesn’t really matter.\n\nThat said, the $85k–$140k quotes you’re getting unfortunately aren’t out of line, especially in year one. Trampolines, ninja courses, and kids are about as bad as it gets from an underwriting standpoint. I pay close to that just for liquor liability in one state with aggressive liability laws, and this risk profile scares carriers even more. Early on, 6–10% of gross going to insurance is very real in this space.\n\nAs for waivers, they do help, but nowhere near what people think. They don’t stop lawsuits, they don’t protect you from gross negligence claims, and they’re much weaker when minors are involved. Insurers know all of this, which is why premiums stay high even if your waiver language is solid.\n\nAt this point the question isn’t how you get cheaper insurance, it’s whether this business can survive its actual risk profile. If you can’t stomach year-one insurance costs at this level, there’s a real chance the model doesn’t work the way you think it does. Your only realistic path forward is a specialty broker and surviving long enough to build clean loss history. Otherwise this turns into a very expensive lesson.",

However, I’ve seen this '12-hour laptop trap' **hundreds of times in my 15 years as a mentor**. You are currently in what I call the **'Circle of Busyness'**: where you mistake movement for progress.\n\nIn my book, **'Startup Inferno'**, I explain that a productive day isn't defined by how many emails you sent, but by how much you reduced the 'structural friction' of your business.\n\nHere is my advice to change your mindset:\n\n1. **Focus on 'Leverage' tasks:** Writing a blog post is fine, but did it improve your conversion rate? Sending emails is okay, but did it shorten your sales cycle? A productive day is one where you build a 'brick' that stays there forever, not just one where you 'tread water'.\n2. **Stop the 12-hour madness:** After 35 years in global strategy and startups, I can tell you: nobody is truly strategic after the 8th hour of staring at a screen. You are likely building a **'Frankenstein Startup',** adding features or content out of anxiety rather than clear vision.\n3. **The 1-Metric Rule:** Define a productive day by one single metric. For you, it might be: 'Did I talk to one fashion photographer today to understand why they haven't paid yet?' That one call is worth 10 blog posts.\n\nA productive day is when you are closer to a scalable system, not just when you are tired. How many of those 12 hours are spent actually talking to potential users vs. just 'polishing' your tool?",

You don’t need a team of 20 or a slide deck for every decision. Just a useful product, a few customers who pay and a feedback loop that actually works.\n\nWould love to hear from others building solo or small- how’s it going for you?

It’s wild how much sharper your thinking gets when the only metric that matters is: do customers keep paying and telling you what to fix next?\n\nOne thing that helped me was treating my micro SaaS like a portfolio asset, not my entire identity: keep it lean, build slow moats (distribution, relationships, workflow depth), and avoid any feature that adds support burden without lifting ARPU or retention.\n\nFor finding those customers, I lean on Hypefury and Taplio for X/LinkedIn, then Pulse for Reddit in the background to catch people describing the exact pain in real time.

If YOU have to ask then I think it suggests it is not possible for you. But Richard Branson never asked anyone whether it was possible. And if I had to guess he never knew if it would work or not, he was having fun and trying to make some money along the way.\n\nI listened to a few of Branson’s masterclass videos and read a biography years ago. The guy just has brass balls he developed from his youth. I remember a story of his mom dropping he and his brother off in the middle of road and making them find their way home. Stuff young adults today would say was “abuse”, but his mom was trying to teach them to be resourceful and solve problems on their own. Branson told a story of how he founded the airline. He was stuck in an airport and his flight kept getting delayed so he just walks into a hangar and talks to some people with planes. Charters one, writes on a paper board “Flights for $99 to wherever the f” he was going, and sold the rest of the empty seats. That was the genesis for the airline idea. \n\nYou look some random ass facts like “he only had this much money” blah blah and you think that is a linchpin to whether he was successful or a failure? He is successful because he tried bold ideas, he solves problems, he doesn’t ask for permission, etc. His mindset is not one to ask Reddit if it will work, he acts on his ideas and sees them through to fruition, and some worked and some didn’t.",

          "text": "It's not a straight comparison really.\n\nBranson's net worth was already £5m by 1979, so £25-30m in today's money, so likely significantly more in 84.  He may have leased a used 747 for a lot less, but he used the cashflow and reputation of the existing Virgin businesses to guarantee the airline and get away with starting the airline itself on comparatively little capital whilst assuring it would't fold whilst he fought for routes (as Freddie Laker found out the hard way).\n\nEarly cashflow came from forward ticket sales. I can remember a tale of Branson writing a cheque to fill the 747 with fuel and wincing.\n\nAnd Virgin Music was launched on an inheritance of around £3k from an aunt and £300 from his mother in 1970s money, plus a bank loan guaranteed by family money of £25k. Modern cash equivalents probably approaching £200k in total.\n\nIt cost him £2500 to cover the studio costs for Tubular Bells...and the net profits on the sales of that were around £5m-£7m in 70's money.\n\nSO: Sure everyone really starts from 'just an idea', but these founder myths aren't helpful.\n\nBranson bootsrapped a smaller business first that was financed, and used that to underpin a bigger business.  You gotta either bring growth capital, or underwritten financing with you pretty quickly if you want to start to make noises in a sector.\n\nNone of this to say that championing Tubular Bells and making a pile out of it, or seeing where Freddie Laker went wrong weren't genius business moves...they definitely were...it's just that he came from an upper middle class background despite the hippy veneer, and was positioned to make it happen.\n\nSome version of that is the lesson for doing the same today.",

Having spent **35 years** navigating both global multinationals and the startup world, and **15 years mentoring hundreds of founders**, I’ve seen this 'Branson myth' lead many people straight into what I call the **'Circle of Heresy',** denying current market reality.\n\nIs it still possible? **Yes, but the rules have changed.**\n\n1. **From 'Flashy Marketing' to 'Structural Trust':** In the 80s, you could launch an airline with a bold move and a phone call. Today, transparency is 10x higher. You can't just 'convince' partners; you need to demonstrate a system that works. In my book **'Startup Inferno'**, I call this avoiding the **'Frankenstein Startup',** don't just stitch together promises; build a solid core.\n2. **The 'Pre-payment' Reality:** Using customer money to scale (bootstrapping) is still the ultimate gold standard. But today, customers are more cynical. You need a 'Minimum Viable Trust' before they hand over their cash.\n3. **The Leverage of 2026:** Branson didn't have AI or global digital reach. Today, you don't need millions to start, but you need **extreme focus**. The danger now isn't 'not having resources', it's 'wasting resources' on 100 different paths.\n\nSuccess today isn't about being a billionaire first; it's about being the most **resilient architect** of your own vision. Most people fail not because they lack Branson's money, but because they lack his ability to simplify complex chaos into a single, executable mission.",

Bought a \"clean\" list, loaded it into a sequence, hit send, and waited for replies like an idiot. Opens were mid, replies were dead, and bounces kept creeping up. I kept blaming subject lines and rewriting my pitch, but the real problem was I was emailing the wrong people. Wrong roles, wrong industries, old contacts, random info that made personalization impossible. I was basically doing spam with extra steps.\n\nHere’s what I changed and it finally started working. I stopped chasing big lists and started building small, tight segments. One niche, one city, one exact buyer type. I do quick spot checks on the company site so I know they are actually my ICP, then I validate emails before anything goes into a sequence. First email stays plain text with no links and one simple question. I send 100 to 200 at a time, see what gets replies, then double down on that exact segment.\n\nMost \"cold email problems\" are not copy problems. They are list problems.

      "text": "First UP, I didn't went from idea to $1300 in 28 days.\n\nFor the first three months I didn't knew that you have to market your product too.\n\nI just kept building.\n\nThen when I had 0 users after having a brutally failed PH launch.\n\nI just went down on researching on how apps really grow from \"0\"\n\nWatched endless starter story videos, reddit threads, podcasts, articles and what not.\n\nThen finally formulated a marketing strategy and went all in on it since 1st January.\n\nIt's been a month now since going all in on Brandled and I now have 35 paying users or about $1.3k in MRR\n\nIt's not millions but atleast a proof that my stuff is working.\n\nNow here's what worked:\n\n1. **Building in public to get initial traction:** I got my first users by posting on X (build in public and startup communities). I would post my wins, updates, lessons learned, and the occasional meme. In the beginning you only need a few users and every post/reply gives you a chance to reach someone.\n2. **Warm DMs:** Nope I didn't blasted thousands of cold dms and messages instead I engaged with my ICPs posts and content and then warm dm them asking them to try out my product and give me some feedback (this was the biggest growth lever)\n3. **Word of mouth:** I always spend most of my time improving the product. My goal is to surprise users with how good the product is, and that naturally leads to them recommending the product to their friends. More than 1/3 of my paying customers come from word of mouth.\n4. **SEO:** I went into SEO from day 1, not targeting broad keywords and instead focussed on Bottom of Funnel keywords (alternatives pages, reviews pages, comparision pages), it basically allows you to steal traffic from your competitors\n5. **Removing all formatting from my emails:** I thought emails that use company branding felt impersonal and that must impact how many people actually read them. After removing all formatting from my emails my open rate almost doubled. Huge win.\n\n**What didn’t work:**\n\n**1. Building free tools:** The tools that received most traffic are usually pretty generic (posts downloader, video extractor etc.) so the audience is pretty cold and it's almost impossible to convert them\n\n**2. Affiliate system:** I’ve had an affiliate system live for months now and I get a ton of applications but it’s extremely rare that an affiliate will actually follow through on their plans. 99% get 0 sign ups.\n\n**3. Building features no one wants (obviously):** I’ve wasted a few weeks here and there when I built out features that no one really wanted. I strongly recommend you to talk to your users and really try to understand them before building out new features.\n\nNext steps:\n\nDoing more of what works. I’m not going to try any new marketing channels until I’m doing my current ones really well. And I will continue spending most of my time improving product (can’t stress how important this has been).\n\nAlso working on a big update but won’t talk about that yet.\n\nBest of luck founders!",
