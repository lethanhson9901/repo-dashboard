      "text": "I honestly owe this community a massive thank you.\n\nA few weeks ago, i posted my story here just a 16-year-old kid sharing a small win of making my first $500. i was terrified of being judged or ignored. Instead, the advice, DMs, and encouragement i received literally changed my trajectory.\n\nBecause of the doors that opened and the confidence i gained from your comments, I’ve managed to scale that initial win to around $1.500 in revenue this month. I’ve even locked in deals with national and international brands.\n\nI’m not saying this to brag. I’m saying this because i want to give back. i don't have a course to sell, but I do have a process that works for me. If this helps even one person get their first client, I’ll be happy.\n\nHere is the exact blend of high tech and  old school hustle I used to fill my pipeline:\n\n1) The AI approach or lead Gen\n\nI realized that spamming people with generic IA templates is a waste of time. Instead, I use AI to be more human, not less.\n\nI use AI agents to scrape leads, but I filter strictly by pain points. I don't look for successful businesses. I look for businesses with great products but terrible websites, or active Instagrams with no link in bio, or some kind of problem that i can fix.\n\nI feed the business's data into an LLM to draft a cold email, but i force it to focus on their problem, not my service.\n\nI never send the raw AI output. i rewrite the opening line manually to prove i actually looked at their brand. High personalization == High response rate.\n\n2. Networking\n\nThis was a game-changer advice I got from a user here.\n\nI stopped trying to act like a corporate agency and started owning my age.\n\nI reach out to potential leads on LinkedIn or email saying I'm a 16 years old student building a business, and I'd love your feedback on X.\n\nPeople are incredibly kind when they see you are young and trying to build something. They lower their guard, they give advice, and often, that advice turns into a contract because they want to support the hustle.\n\n3. Boots on the ground \n\nThis is the one most people skip because it's uncomfortable, but it brought me my best clients.\n\nI physically walk into local businesses.\n\nI don't pitch. i listen. i ask, what is the most annoying thing about your marketing /tech right now?\n\nI offer to lend a hand with something small for free first. Fix a glitch, edit a photo, update a setting.\n\nThat small act of kindness builds trust faster than any cold email ever could.\n\nTo the community ❤️\n\nThank you for not dismissing me because of my age. You guys gave me the push i needed to take this seriously.\n\nA question for those ahead of me:\n\nI’m starting to get to the point where i have more leads than time. For those who scaled past this point did you automate more first, or did you hire help immediately?",

Success isn't guaranteed, and it only serves you to broaden your skillsets and perspectives. I say ride the wave with your business, and let it fund the things you want to achieve in life, whether that is funding college, or bigger and more enterprising ventures that can scale beyond what time you personally have available.\n\nIn the meantime, you could look into only taking projects that are worth it to you. Not every project will be equal, and maybe your time is more valuable than $500, or later $1500, or later who knows?",

Here's the thing: don't automate or hire yet. I know that sounds backwards, but hear me out. You're 16 and you've got something way more valuable than time right now, you've got momentum and you're still learning what actually works. The second you automate or bring someone in, you lose that direct feedback loop. You stop understanding why things work. I've watched people (including myself) try to scale too early and it just creates expensive chaos. Instead, raise your prices. Seriously. If you've got more leads than time, that means you're undercharging. Let the market thin itself out. The clients who stay at higher rates are usually better to work with anyway. Then once you've worked at that level for a few months and you truly understand your process inside and out, that's when you document everything and consider help. You've already figured out the hardest part (getting clients). Don't rush past the part where you become absolutely excellent at delivery. That's your real competitive advantage.",

              "text": "Raising prices first is exactly the move here, and honestly, I wish someone drilled that into me earlier.\n\nWhen you’ve got more demand than time, it’s a signal problem, not a systems problem. Higher prices do three things at once: filter out flaky clients, buy you breathing room, and force you to tighten your offer. That’s where you actually learn what people value enough to pay real money for.\n\nWhile you’re in that phase, treat every project like R&D: after each one, write down what you did, where you got stuck, what you’d never do again. That becomes your first “playbook” and later your onboarding doc for a contractor or VA. Only then does automation/hiring make sense because you’re not guessing what to offload.\n\nTools like Notion or Google Docs are enough to track process, and stuff like Zapier to remove little annoyances. I’ve tried things like LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Apollo for outreach, but Pulse for Reddit has been the thing I use when I want to spot real conversations from people already talking about the problems I solve.\n\nSo yeah: raise prices now, build the playbook while you’re busy, then scale on purpose instead of out of panic.",

      "text": "A lot of people think you need hundreds of thousands of dollars, an MBA, or 10 years of experience to buy a business.\n\nThat wasn’t my experience at all.\n\nWhen I was 21, I bought my first business for **$4,000**. It was a small B2C SaaS that was already making around **$500/month**. Nothing crazy as such, but it was real revenue.\n\nAnd that I exited at 6 figures.\n\nSince then, I’ve bought **5 more businesses**, all for **under $10k**, and every one of them was already making money when I bought it.\n\nI don’t come from a finance background. I wasn’t rich. I just spent time looking for small deals most people ignore.\n\nOne big reason I prefer buying instead of starting from scratch:  \nyou’re not guessing if the idea will work.\n\nThe business already exists. Customers are already paying. There’s way less uncertainty compared to starting something new where you’re testing everything from zero.\n\nIf a bought business doesn’t work out, you usually still have options - improve it, fix obvious issues, or even sell it again. That feels way less risky to me than pouring months (or years) into something that may never make a dollar.\n\nEven while writing this, I can see **dozens of small businesses with revenue** selling for just a few thousand dollars.\n\nWhat actually matters isn’t being rich or “qualified.” It’s more about finding decent deals, being willing to take action (Execution is really imp), negotiating the right price and keep on iterating once you own it, etc.\n\nThere are a lot of businesses out there where **you’d be a better operator than the current owner**.",

If you have basic sales, support, or ops skills, you can often double a tiny SaaS just by tightening those.\n\nI’d add: focus on one channel you can operate well (cold email, content, Reddit, whatever) before chasing new features. I’ve used tools like Apollo and Lemlist for that first sales push, and Pulse for Reddit to catch keywords and threads where people are already complaining about competitors or asking for alternatives.\n\nKey point: you’re buying momentum and a sandbox to learn in, not a finished product-so pick something where your specific skills can move the needle fast.",

I used my registered agent address because thats what i thought you were supposed to do, but now they want proof that im actually operating from that location, im in Europe and  this is a software company so why do i need a physical office to run google ads?

          "text": "Oh we definitely did and still pay monthly for most of the agents we use tbh! I just looked at our billing dashboard and here are the ones that stood out:\n\n1. Gamma: Great for automating making presentations! Gamma created a fully designed presentation for me (including all the content) from a one line prompt in 90 seconds. This was damn impressive!   \n2. Windsurf/Cursor: Everyone in our team gets either Windsurf or Cursor, which has literally tripled our developer output. We ship products much faster now. Personally I am huge fan of Windsurf Cascade agent that as been able to pull off large changes to our production app from a single prompt! But some prefer Cursor!  \n3. Lovable/Bolt: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Bolt instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff!  \n4. Frizerly: I have an automation using Frizerly AI agent that pulls all our Google search console data, and comes up with a strategy for blogs on our website based on last months changes and current strategy. It then auto publishes a blog daily on our wordpress website! It can also generate and publish instagram posts weekly using our exact product images that mostly involves educational content! \n5. Clay: We have taught Clay our ideal customer personal using previous conversions. Now it can automatically reach out on both email and LinkedIn to schedule our first sales calls for our sales team. Saves a lot of time for everyone. Conversion rate for the automation is same as manual outreach at this point.\n6. Google Nano Banana: Google Nano Banana has been a game changer in helping us create marketing assets from scratch with simple product images. It can easily turn simple images to full blown product shoots!  \n\n \n\nWould love to learn what others are paying for as well!",

      "text": "Been building **Brandled** with AI and basically zero technical background. Everyone talks about how easy it is now with Claude Code, Antigravity etc.., but they leave out the part where you get completely fucked by production issues that AI can't solve.\n\nPure AI coding gets you maybe 60% there. You can build nice landing pages, set up login systems, even get a decent dashboard running. But then real subscribers start using your product and everything breaks in ways the AI never warned you about.\n\nLemonsqueezy integration that worked perfectly in test mode but randomly failed with real customers. I thought I was making money while actual payments were bouncing. AI couldn't explain webhook validation or why certain cards were getting declined without proper error handling.\n\nDatabase performance that was fine with 10 users but completely shit with 1,000+. Every query started timing out. AI kept suggesting caching fixes instead of telling me I was running garbage queries on unindexed tables. My dashboard was loading every single data point instead of paginating like a normal human would.\n\nUser sessions that just randomly logged people out. What happens when someone's subscription expires while they're using the app? How do you handle multiple browser tabs? AI could fix individual bugs but had no clue how to build proper session management.\n\nData isolation problems where customers could see each other's data. That's a fun support ticket to get. AI had zero understanding of how to debug multi-tenant architecture or why my database setup was fundamentally broken.\n\nBilling logic that looked perfect but created accounting chaos. Proration, failed payment retries, subscription changes - the AI code \"worked\" but had edge cases that destroyed my revenue tracking. One customer downgrading somehow triggered three billing events and I couldn't figure out what the hell happened.\n\nThe turning point was realizing I needed to be a better AI supervisor, not just blindly trust whatever code it spat out. Started setting up actual logging for critical actions, testing payment flows with real cards before launching, keeping a simple spreadsheet of what actually worked vs what looked good in dev.\n\nSpent a few weeks learning database basics, payment processing fundamentals, how web apps actually handle user data and security. Not trying to become a senior dev, just enough to read server logs and understand when something was genuinely broken vs a quick fix.\n\nMost success stories skip the part where they got stuck for weeks on subscription billing or had to hire actual developers to rebuild their payment system. The sweet spot is learning just enough SaaS fundamentals to not get completely destroyed by production, then using AI to move 10x faster on the stuff you actually understand.\n\nStill using AI for 90% of my development, but now I can tell when it's giving me code that'll explode in production vs code that'll actually work with real users and real money.",

AI will happily generate working SQL that's technically correct but absolute garbage at scale. it doesn't think about n+1 queries or what happens when your users table hits 100k rows because it's never had to sit there watching a dashboard spin for 30 seconds.\n\nhonestly the most underrated skill for vibe coding is knowing what questions to ask. like if you'd prompted \"what are the common production gotchas with lemon squeezy webhooks\" before building, you probably would've caught the validation issues early. the AI knows this stuff, it just won't volunteer it unless you ask.",

Had the exact same experience - everything tested perfectly with test Stripe webhooks, then production happened and suddenly customers were getting charged twice because I didn't account for network timeouts causing retry attempts.\n\nOne thing that saved me later: before any payment-related action, I started logging the \"intent\" with a timestamp, then the \"result\" after. When something weird happens, you can trace exactly what the app thought was happening vs what actually happened. AI won't suggest this kind of defensive logging because it doesn't think about your app at 3am when a customer emails saying they got charged three times.\n\nThe 90% AI / 10% supervision ratio you landed on sounds about right. The 10% is just knowing where the landmines are - payments, auth, data isolation. Basically anywhere real money or real users can break things in ways that only show up in production.",

In my 35 years in tech, starting back at **Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)** and moving through the dot-com bubble to today, the tools change, but the traps stay the same. You just described what I call the **Circle of Feature Lust** in my e-book, **Startup Inferno**.\n\nAI is a world-class 'cosplayer.' It can act like a Senior Dev, but it has zero accountability for production-level architecture. As you found out, building a UI is easy; building a **robust system** that handles edge cases, race conditions, and multi-tenancy is where the real business lives.\n\n**Two things I want to highlight from your struggle:**\n\n1. **The 'Boring' Fundamentals:** you realized that you don't need to be a Senior Dev, but you DO need to understand the 'boring' stuff (webhooks, indexing, session states). In the Inferno, ignoring the 'boring' is a shortcut to a burn rate disaster.\n2. **AI as an Accelerator, not a Pilot:** using AI for 90% of the code is fine, but as soon as you stop being the 'Architect' and start being just a 'Prompt Engineer,' you've lost control of your company.\n\nI wrote Startup Inferno precisely to help founders like you bridge that gap—understanding the '9 Circles' of mistakes so you can stop the fire before it destroys your database (and your reputation).\n\nKudos to you for staying in the trenches and learning the hard way. That '2 months of hell' just gave you more business acumen than 10 years of 'vibe coding' ever could.",

On the integration side, we’ve found it helps a lot to have customer connections isolated by default (separate auth, separate tenants), which is a big part of why multi-tenancy is built into Cyclr. \n\nWhat's the elevator pitch for Brandled?",

Where it falls apart is when you need to debug production issues at 2am and you don't understand what the code is actually doing. The AI got you there quickly but now you're stuck.\n\nThe sweet spot I've found: use AI to accelerate the parts you already understand. It's a multiplier, not a replacement. If you understand database design, AI helps you write schemas faster. If you don't understand database design, AI gives you a schema that works until it catastrophically doesn't.\n\nThe people who'll win long-term with this approach are the ones treating AI as a senior developer they pair with, not a magic box they delegate to. You still need to review what it produces and understand why it made those choices.\n\nThat said, the barrier to launching a product has never been lower. That's exciting.

Sellers rarely are given the benefit of the doubt with Amazon (from my experience anyway).  It seems this would be the same as you simply accepting all the disputes and saving your time (although a high loss rate could have future consequences with your payment processor).\n\nStripe has an option where you can buy chargeback insurance and they will handle it all — I think they may even guarantee your money (but I'm not sure about that part).

Amazon not only provides traffic, it absorbs a ton of operational friction.\n\nSome of the things I’ve seen that spike Shopify disputes are stuff like longer delivery windows or inconsistent tracking updates, customers not recognizing the charge descriptor, and selling higher-ticket or impulse-buy products without strong post-purchase comms.\n\nAt some point, it becomes cheaper to just change the system than dispute every charge. That can mean better descriptors, order confirmation emails, delivery notifications, and even preemptive refunds in some cases.\n\nYou're not wrong that the time drain is brutal. Disputes aren’t really about “proof.” They're about how card networks bias the outcome.",

      "text": "I started my programming journey at 12 back in 2002. I remember bringing homework with sorting algorithms to class on floppy disks, sometimes even writing code on paper.\n\nBy the time I graduated university, I was juggling two software engineering jobs ($2.5k/mo). I eventually moved into a standard 9-5 and quickly jumped to lead positions (currently earning around $10k/mo).\n\nI’ve always had side projects. One I’m particularly proud of involves managing industrial labeling machines (Layer 2). It started in 2020 and has made about $50k so far. We’ve built 20 machines that are currently running inside meat processing plants.\n\nWhile working on the industrial machines, I hit a wall: I needed a way to access these remote machines behind firewalls and NATs. I looked for a reliable local tunneling service that supported both TCP and UDP, but existing solutions were either too expensive or didn't fit my specific technical needs.\n\nIn late 2025, the \"AI Agent\" era kicked off. Honestly? I was a huge skeptic. I thought they were good for landing pages or API wrappers, but not for complex network engineering.\n\nI decided to challenge that skepticism: Could I build my own tunneling service using AI agents?\n\nMy goal was to build a profitable SaaS (or at least save money on 3rd party tools). I spent 2 months building this in parallel with my 9-5 and the industrial project.\n\nThe Results:\n\nI am actually shocked by the power of these agents. The result exceeded my expectations. The code isn't perfect, but it works surprisingly well.\n\nI launched the project 3 weeks ago as open sourced. As of today:\n\n* 210 registered users\n* 3-5 active tunnels at any given time (people are actually using it!)\n* 497 stars on GitHub\n* $2 MRR 😆 (It’s not much, but it’s infinitely better than $0)\n\nIf you are skeptical about AI agents for backend work, I encourage you give it a try. It was a massive learning experience.\n\n\n\n",

Building for industrial labeling machines is the definition of solving a 'boring', high-value problem, that’s where the real money is.\n\nYou’ve hit a classic fork in the road. You have 500 stars on GitHub but only $2 MRR. In my e-book, **Startup Inferno**, I’ve seen many brilliant engineers get stuck in the **Circle of Craftsmanship**: you built a great tool, but you might be accidentally building a 'charity' instead of a SaaS.\n\n**My veteran advice for your next 3 months:**\n\n1. **The 'Open Source Trap':** 500 stars mean you solved a dev problem. 2$ MRR means you haven't solved the 'payment friction' yet. Don't let the dopamine of GitHub stars distract you from the brutal reality of unit economics.\n2. **AI Agents for Scale, not just Code:** use those agents now to automate the 'boring' business side (outreach, documentation, support) so you can keep your 9-5 while scaling.\n3. **Don't 'Cosplay' the Hobbyist:** if this is a business, treat the $2 MRR as a fire that needs oxygen.\n\nI wrote Startup Inferno precisely to help technical founders like you navigate the transition from 'cool project' to 'surviving business.'\n\nQuick question: Since you're in the meat processing industry, have you considered selling the 'tunneling' as a premium security feature for industrial IoT rather than a generic dev tool?

We'd been talking to this BD guy who wanted 5% and I was about to say yes because... idk, he seemed confident about it and I had nothing to compare it to.\n\nThe whole equity thing is way more nuanced than I realized when we incorporated. Like there's fully diluted vs issued shares, how safes actually convert (not how I thought they did), what happens to the option pool when you raise. My cofounder and I spent an entire weekend just trying to figure out what we'd actually be giving away if we said yes to this advisor.\n\nAnyway we didn't give him the 5%. Moved our cap table into mantle after that whole mess because our spreadsheet was making me anxious every time I opened it, couldn't tell if the formulas were even right. But honestly the bigger lesson was just... ask other founders before you commit to anything equity related.

      "text": "Started this in late November. Film myself once, use the footage for 11 different accounts with different faces. Seemed like a shortcut.\n\nI'd do the real movements and expressions, just change the face. So I wouldn't be on camera but the content would still feel authentic.\n\nHonestly just kept making more accounts. Started with 3, then made a few more when those didn't pop immediately. Ended up with 11.\n\nFirst few weeks were just setup. Created 11 different characters using reference photos. Made them look different enough that you wouldn't connect the accounts. Different ages, ethnicities, styles.\n\nFor the face swaps I'm using whatever works. Been rotating between APOB, Reface, and HeyGen depending on what I need. APOB I use most because I can process a few at a time. Reface is faster for single edits. HeyGen has better lip sync but costs more. None of them are perfect.\n\nThe workflow: film myself doing 5-6 exercises in one session, usually Sunday mornings in my apartment gym when no one's around. Feels weird doing burpees and talking to a camera by myself but whatever. Then I process them through whichever tool makes sense, export the versions, schedule them. Takes about 4-5 hours per week now. Setup took way longer though, probably 30-40 hours total in the first month.\n\nWeek 6 I was done. All accounts under 500 followers after putting in all that time. Sat there staring at the analytics thinking I'd wasted a month and a half on the dumbest idea ever. Almost deleted everything.\n\nThen account 1 randomly popped off. Woke up one morning to 50k views on a video I thought was mediocre. Checked my phone like five times thinking it was a glitch. Now it's at 8k followers and still growing. Some videos hit 10k views, some get 2k. No pattern I can figure out.\n\nAccounts 3, 5, and 7 are doing okay. Between 800-2k followers each. They grow but slow. Making around $200 total per month from affiliate stuff across these three.\n\nThe rest are basically dead. Highest one is under 500 followers after two months. Some videos barely get any views. I'm posting the same frequency, same hooks, same everything. Just different faces.\n\nStarted noticing weird patterns. The account with the older looking character does way better with strength training content. The younger looking one gets more engagement on HIIT stuff. Makes no sense because it's literally the same person doing the movements.\n\nAlso ran into issues I didn't expect. One account got flagged for \"inauthentic behavior\" on Instagram. Nothing happened but it spooked me. Another one, people started commenting that something looked off. One comment was like \"why does your face look different in every video lol\" and I panicked. Tried different tools to see if one looked more natural but they all have issues sometimes.\n\nThe successful account made $520 in December and is tracking around $450 so far this month from supplement links. So across all accounts I'm at maybe $650-700 monthly depending on the month.\n\nMy roommate thinks the whole thing is weird. Keeps asking why I'm filming myself then not posting my real face. Can't really explain it without sounding sketchy.\n\nBiggest problem is I can't figure out what made account 1 successful. I've tried copying everything about it to the dead accounts. Same posting times, same caption style, same hashtags. Nothing moves the needle.\n\nPart of me wants to kill the bottom 6 but I keep thinking what if they just need more time. I've already put in the work to set them up. Feels wasteful to delete them when posting is basically automated now anyway.\n\nAlso paranoid about the face swap thing. Haven't seen anyone else talk about getting flagged for it but I know platforms are cracking down on synthetic content. Don't know if I should mention in bios that it's not my real face or just keep quiet.\n\nAnyone running multiple accounts like this? Feels like I'm either onto something or wasting time on accounts that'll never work.",

Then see what the algorithm feeds you after you hit your content. You may be shocked, or it could just...make sense. Derive the population watching this and what content they are expecting to see from that experience. Easy-peasy. \n\n\nThe slowly growing userbase might be more valuable in the future than the almost viral post, but you can derive good information from both. The real value here is not the money, but the data. If you cannot at least infer it from using the app, then you're not the one who's gonna make the money off of your content. ",

This project includes a maximum of 4 major revisions and 4 minor revisions. “Major revision” means moving any part of the design that requires rearranging design elements. “Minor revision” means changes to color or [make your own decision]. Additional revisions are charged by the half hour at $250/hr and payable upon delivery of the revision. Major revisions require at least 2 hours. No ‘extra’ revisions will be accepted unless 90% of the contract is paid; the final 10% is due with final approval of the design prior to delivery of the final product. If the project extends beyond 21 days, the full amount of the contract is due even if the final design has not been approved and the final design formatting will be billed as a final revision. \n\nThe initial consultation leads to x number of designs. After deciding to pursue a design, changing to a different concept will require a new project contract. This contract will be considered complete and a credit applied to the new contract prorated to account for work already complete. This does not matter if the new concept is one of the presented designs or a completely different concept.’\n\nWhen you are sending revisions back, the subject of the email or somewhere very obvious on the deliverable needs to have MAJOR REVISION #2/3 or something similar. When they ask for the first “extra” revision, you send the invoice for the amount due and then wait until it’s paid per your contract terms. It’s scary, but when you hold the line, most people will pay and not even question it. Don’t ever apologize for holding to your agreement. It’s not negotiable until you signal to the client that it is negotiable. Don’t do that.\n\nIn this situation, you dug yourself in. Stop the bleeding and say the project is done and send the bill. If the girlfriend freaks out, move on, send the bill, and be pleasantly surprised when the client pays and apologizes.",

      "text": "Hello,\n\nI’m 21 (in Canada) and a university student, doing computer science. I’m pretty much in my last year. I know the logical thing to do is just finish the degree since I’m almost done, I only have like 9 courses left to do including this current semester. I don’t know whether it’s because I’m juggling too many things at once and I’m burnt out which is why I feel like quitting everything and running away to some island or what.\n\nAbout my work situation. I am taking 3 courses. I’m working on 5 paid projects currently which are related to software development. I’m also working part time on the side remotely as a full stack dev intern. This has given me confidence to build stuff on my own and try to sell it. I contacted one of my old workplaces where I worked as an admin assistant and I remembered a specific problem they had and I was able to provide them a solution for a small price. I’m also good at social skills, so maybe that’s why they remembered me and trusted me?\n\nBefore I had any tech work to do, I was working retail and as a technical instructor to children, and like different summer jobs basically to earn some money.\n\nWhat university has done for me in the past 4 years. The student status helped me get into a program/networking that led to all this current paid work I’m doing and really padded my resume. I also got some paid TAing experience. But what it hasn’t done for me is actually teach me anything…. It probably is my fault since I don’t go to class at all. I don’t remember a single course over the years where I actually went to class regularly. Usually I just go for a few days then stop and work on assignments online and show up before the exam days. I literally only study the night before and cram everything. I get Bs and Cs somehow. My friends tell me I’m crazy for spending so much money doing a degree and I’m not even “making an effort” towards my education, but like they don’t know what I do on the side or how much I’m always working and sacrificing my sleep and I don’t feel like explaining it to them either cuz it doesn’t matter.\n\nBut it does make me wonder whether I’m doing the right thing? Before when I was working simpler jobs where I didn’t have to use my brain as much, university didn’t really bother me. But since the past year, it’s been really bothering me. Last winter semester, I withdrew from classes halfway cuz I just couldn’t take it and only got half tuition refunded. Fall was okay, but now I’m feeling it again, especially since it’s more work than before.\n\nI don’t know if this matters but I’m Asian and I was brought up in a strict abusive household and I learned pretty quickly that unless I earn money I’m pretty useless to everyone, so yea that’s been carved in my brain to “make money” And they probably would have a big problem with me quitting (not that they pay for any of my school, but I live with them)\n\nI literally have an exam in like 6 hours and I can’t bring myself to study, usually I would be cramming, but I just hate it so much. It’s not even that hard.\n\nThe reason I can even think about dropping out and going the entrepreneur route is because of the experience I have gained so far. I am also not romanticizing the idea of entrepreneurship, I know it may be years of grinding and not achieving anything in the end. it’s just something I feel like I must try or I would regret it for the rest of my life. I also don’t have an exact plan in mind of what I would do if I were to drop out today, but the problem is I don’t have the time to THINK about it or explore it since there’s always one thing after another due. I have bunch of ideas listed, but no time to try any of it or validate the market for it.\n\nI feel like I’m shooting a shot in the dark. Idk I’m lost. Any advice is appreciated, thanks.\n\nTLDR; Did you quit uni/college to go the entrepreneur route or did you stick to doing both? How do you even keep going?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the advice. I will probably stick it out, it's just 9 courses left. After this semester, I will have a 4 month break as well so I will be able to reset.",

You are currently in the **Circle of Burnout**, and you are making decisions based on exhaustion, not strategy.\n\nYou have 9 courses left. In the grand scheme of a 40-year career, that is a blink of an eye. If you drop out now, you aren't 'becoming an entrepreneur,' you are just escaping a pressure cooker.\n\n**Here is the reality check from my book, Startup Inferno:** Entrepreneurship is not an escape from hard work; it’s an intensification of it. If you can't manage the 'annoying' task of finishing 9 courses, the 'annoying' tasks of taxes, legal compliance, and failed pivots will crush you even harder.\n\n**My advice to save your sanity and your future:**\n\n1. **The 'Good Enough' Degree:** stop aiming for B's and C's if it costs you your sleep. Aim for the bare minimum to pass. A degree is a binary switch (Yes/No); nobody cares about your GPA once you've built your first SaaS.\n2. **Cut the Projects:** You are working 5 paid projects + an internship + university. That’s not entrepreneurship; that’s **Self-Exploitation**. Drop 2 projects. The money you lose now is cheaper than the therapy you'll need later.\n3. **Validate, Don't Guess:** You say you have ideas but no time to validate. That’s a trap. Most people who quit uni to 'build' end up doing **Startup Cosplay,** acting like founders without a market.\n\nI wrote Startup Inferno for people exactly in your position: high-achievers who are burning out because they don't have a map to navigate the fire.\n\n**Finish the degree.** Not for your parents, but for your 'Future Founder' self. It’s the ultimate test of finishing what you start, a trait every successful entrepreneur needs.\n\nTake a breath. Go to that exam in 6 hours. Don't study to master it; study to survive it.",

      "text": "2 years in B2B lead gen (building my own lead gen agency). Last 6 months I've been experimenting with AI to speed up my workflow, and honestly? I'm finding qualified leads I would've never caught before. (I get it a waaaay tooo long post, but hear me out, it took about 25 minutes to write it by hand and about 3 hours to structure my thoughts).\n\nThe \"obvious\" stuff everyone knows: 1 ChatGPT for email personalization. 2Scraping LinkedIn with AI parsers. 3 Basic ICP matching\n\nMy approach:\n\n1. AI-generated \"lookalike\" ICPs. I took our 20 best customers, exported their LinkedIn + company data, and fed it to Chatgpt with this prompt: *\"Find hidden commonalities. Ignore obvious stuff like industry and company size. Look at hiring patterns, tech mentions, recent news, executive backgrounds.\"* And 14 of our 20 buyers had hired a \"Head of Revenue Operations\" 3-6 months before purchasing. Not in their title - buried in company announcements and team pages. We never targeted this because it's not a job title we could filter for.\n\nHow I use it now: I scrape \"recently funded\" lists from Crunchbase, then use gpt to identify which ones have RevOps hiring signals in their careers pages or exec LinkedIn profiles. I prioritize those. Conversion rate jumped from 2.1% to 6.8% on that segment alone.\n\n2. \"Negative ICP\" analysis. Exported 500 leads from last year that never converted (including 50 where we actually talked to them and they said no). Fed the data to Claude with context: *\"Pattern-match why these were bad fits. Look for combinations of signals.\"* Companies using Salesforce + HubSpot simultaneously had 80% no-show rate on demos. Also: companies that raised Series B 6+ months ago but hadn't posted any \"we're hiring\" content in 90 days were dead ends (likely hiring freezes, no budget).\n\nHow I use it now: I built a Clay enrichment table that flags these combinations before I even reach out. If I see \"Salesforce + HubSpot\" in their tech stack, I deprioritize or skip entirely. Saved \\~15 hours/month on dead leads.\n\n3. AI-suggested \"weird\" angles. Instead of generic personalization, I use this workflow: Take a prospect's company, feed GPT their recent news + LinkedIn activity + job openings, then ask: *\"What's a specific, non-obvious business problem they likely have right now that our \\[product category\\] solves? Give me 3 angles.\"* Real example: Target was VP Sales at a Series B fintech. GPT surfaced they just expanded to 3 EU countries from US-only. Angle: *\"Compliance with EU data residency for sales calls recorded in Gong - most US fintechs miss this until it's a legal issue.\"* Result: 67% reply rate on that campaign vs. our usual 12%. The specificity hit different.\n\nMy current stack:\n\n* WarpLeads as lead database (tested 12 ICP variations last month without burning credits which is nice for AI experimentation)\n* Clay for AI enrichment and research automation\n* Instantly for sequencing\n* ChatGPT/Claude (honestly I liked Claude more) for the creative qualification angles\n\nAI doesn't just speed up busywork. It lets you *test 10x more hypotheses* about who buys and why. I went from 2-3 ICP tests per month to 15-20. Some fail hard. But the winners? 40% higher reply rates.\n\nGuys, what non-obvious AI workflows are you using for lead qualification? Still feel like I'm barely scratching the surface.",

After a while it looked more like busywork than success - if you can test more but you're not more successful year-over-year than what you did before, then nothing changed.\n\nOne salesperson's individual strength of connection to the local market was a better indicator of success than anything else, because good personal relationships always trumped \"signals\".\n\nIt's easy to look interesting, it's hard to be statistically significant.",

If they aren't meeting milestones, then have a conversation to understand why and adjust accordingly.  If they continue to fall short, then you need to have a tougher conversation.\n\nMicromanaging would be overseeing exactly how they're completing tasks within a milestone.

In reality, it helps them test things faster and more cheaply. Recommendation: find a “pain point” in a particular industry or community and simply try to solve it. It doesn't have to be beautiful, detailed, or scalable. You just need a rudimentary way to solve the problem and publish it.

      "text": "I've been working with early stage founders for a while now and there's a pattern I kept seeing over and over. They'd come in with a solid idea, spend months building, and then just... stall. Not because the tech was hard. Because they kept adding things.\n\nFeature after feature, \"oh we also need this,\" and suddenly what was supposed to be a simple product turned into a massive project with no clear finish line.\n\nSo at some point I started forcing a framework on every project I touched. I call it the 3-3-5 rule and honestly it's pretty simple once you see it.\n\nThe idea is you cap everything. No exceptions.\n\n3 database entities. That's your max. Like Users, Listings, and Bookings or whatever makes sense for your product. You want to add a fourth? Cool, that's a V2 conversation.\n\n3 external APIs. Stripe, an email service, maybe an AI API. Pick three. Every single integration you add is another thing that can slow you down or break.\n\n5 core user flows. Just map out the actual path a user takes. Something like sign up, create a listing, browse, book, pay. That's it. If something doesn't fit into one of those five flows, it's not going in.\n\nWe've been shipping MVPs inside this box in about 30 days using Supabase and React. The budget usually lands around $4k. And the reason it works isn't because we're doing anything crazy technically. It's just that the constraints force you to actually decide what matters before you start coding.\n\nAnyway, curious if anyone else has run into this. The hardest part honestly is just getting founders to agree to cut stuff. Happy to talk through how we actually figure out which flows make the cut if anyone's interested.",

I was just killing time, half-curious, half-restless, typing vague searches like “interesting startup ideas” and opening whatever looked remotely useful. Most of it was the usual stuff I’d seen a hundred times before, and I was about to give up when I clicked into a database-style site full of structured ideas and problem statements.startupideasDB\n\nAt first I treated it like light reading. Scroll, skim, move on. But something felt different. Instead of grand visions or hypey trends, each entry described a very specific, almost mundane problem someone out there was actually dealing with. And alongside it was a simple, practical way to solve it. It felt less like browsing content and more like walking past rows of unbuilt tools, each one quietly saying, “you could make me.”\n\nOne problem stopped me mid-scroll. It was so familiar that I could immediately picture the people who would use a solution for it. My brain switched from passive reading to active imagining. What would the first screen look like? What’s the smallest useful version of this? Could I hack together a prototype in a weekend?\n\nI tried to keep browsing, but my mind kept drifting back to that one idea. By the time I closed the tab, I wasn’t thinking about ten possibilities anymore, just that single, stubborn concept that refused to leave. Later that evening I opened my notes app “just to jot down a few thoughts” and ended up mapping out features and user flows until well past midnight.\nIt felt oddly effortless. Not because the work would be easy, but because the direction was suddenly clear. For months I’d been stuck in endless ideation, waiting for a lightning bolt. Instead, what moved me forward was simply running into a well-defined problem at the right time and realizing, almost casually, that I was capable of solving it.\n\nI don’t know where this project will end up, but I do know that the search is over. I’m no longer wandering through abstract possibilities; I’m building something concrete. All it took was a quiet moment of discovery that turned idle browsing into a starting line.",
