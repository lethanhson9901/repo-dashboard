A number of crates do that for you. **THEN** Manually implementing [std::fmt:*](https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler/blob/main/src/frontend/parser/ast.rs#L350) crap. All because claude never actually made or used an abstraction around bit-masks, so they have to glue it together manually. \n2. The whole AST copies every text fragment into individual buffers & re-allocates them. Rough parse trees are literally ideal for `&'a str` or `Cow<'a,str>` (references to the source file) but most LLMs really **really** struggle with lifetime management. It is wild because the \"file\" is kept allocated the whole time as [spans](https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler/blob/main/src/common/source.rs#L3) are just byte offsets into the text. It also can't handle >4GiB source files, which `cl.exe` does now (and has for ~10 years), so this just sad.",

Not just something done faster and cheaper, but like the actual tipping point?\n\nLLMs are already profoundly useful and impressive as a natural language search and information retrieval tool. They've got that shit down, and have done for over a year now.\n\nAs someone who has been doing this for a very long time and currently gets no speedup by using LLMs to write code (except as a search tool for docs), the point where I'll consider using an LLM to write code for me will be when:\n\n1. I have the option to run it locally, or at least self-hosted on a general purpose cloud platform, meaning no one can deny me access to it, and...\n\n2. Its rate of getting things completely wrong (in everything but the smallest and most textbook-ass trivial tasks that I can do in my fucking sleep anyway) goes down from the current 60% or so, to perhaps 5%. I think if I only had to rewrite 1 in 20 lines instead of more than half, that would be about the threshold where the LLM would go from an irritation to an actual timesaver.\n\nFor now, the very high error rate and the proprietary nature of the LLMs that suck the least make it hard to be impressed with any of this.",

The big tech companies want a tool that can just copy other companies products and then they use their control of search, advertising and the platforms to make sure their version is the one that wins out. They don't care if others have to do the hard creative part and come up with the first version, all they care about is that they can quickly clone it and use their market control to ensure they get the money and the original creator gets nothing. These are plagiarism machines built on plagiarism. Pointing out that that's all they are good for misses the point. As far as the big tech companies are concerned that's all they are needed for.\n\nGo look up Eric Schmidt's talk at Stanford where he tells all the devs in the room (I'm paraphrasing from memory here) \"You guys should be telling your AI to clone TikTok and attempt to go viral and if it fails, try again a few days later.\" He even goes so far as to tell them not to worry about the illegality of it all because if it succeeds they'll have more than enough money to pay good enough lawyers to fight it out in court. That's how these guys are thinking. Not of AI as a tool to help them create cool new things but of AI as a tool to help them steal the cool things others create.",

Don't forget to suggest surgical assistants and nurses in this context, and watch things get really wild.\n\n.\n\nEdit: prepend all of the above with the following and paste it into either chatgpt or gemini:\n\nWhile you are not a session involved in what I describe below, I'm curious: how do you respond to my post from reddit that follows the colon:",

If you have access to the compromised binaries you can see where it was contacting to get the malicious updates. Which region is the server in, and has that IP been used for other attacks in the past?\n\nYou can also identify based on the time the attack occurred - what time-zone was it done in? If it was performed at 3am in China then it's not likely to be a Chinese group, but if it's like 1:30pm in Beijing, after time for some nice lunch? Much more reasonable.\n\nAlso, you can gather information by looking at the targets - what kinds of systems were targeted? Who were the victims? The article mentioned that the attack only affected certain targets, so you can gauge who the perpetrator was by what they had to gain based on who was targeted.\n\nYou can also look at the choice of targets and timing to correlate to in-world current events. Which targets were picked and why would that timing matter to various suspects?\n\nYou add all these little pieces of evidence up and figure out what the percentage chance of various attackers is.",

The shared hosting server in question was compromised until the 2nd of September, 2025. On this particular date, the server had scheduled maintenance where the kernel and firmware were updated. After this date, we could not identify any similar patterns in logs, and this indicates that bad actors have lost access to the server. We also find no evidence of similar patterns on any other shared hosting servers.\n> 2. Even though the bad actors have lost access to the server from the 2nd of September, 2025, they maintained the credentials of our internal services existing on that server until the 2nd of December, which could have allowed the malicious actors to redirect some of the traffic going to https://notepad-plus-plus.org/getDownloadUrl.php to their own servers and return the updates download URL with compromised updates.\n> 3. Based on our logs, we see no other clients hosted on this particular server being targeted. The bad actors specifically searched for https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ domain with the goal to intercept the traffic to your website, as they might know the then-existing Notepad++ vulnerabilities related to insufficient update verification controls.\n> 4. After concluding our research, the investigated security findings were no longer observed in the web hosting systems from the 2nd of December, 2025, and onwards, as:\n>   * We have fixed vulnerabilities, which could have been used to target Notepad++. In particular, we do have logs indicating that the bad actor tried to re-exploit one of the fixed vulnerabilities; however, the attempt did not succeed after the fix was implemented.\n>   * We have rotated all the credentials that bad actors could have obtained until the 2nd of September, 2025.\n>   * We have checked the logs for similar patterns in all web hosting servers and couldn’t find any evidence of systems being compromised, exploited in a similar way, or data breached.\n>\n> While we have rotated all the secrets on our end, below you will find the preventive actions you should take to maximize your security. However, if below actions have been done after the 2nd of December, 2025, no actions are needed from your side.\n>\n> * Change credentials for SSH, FTP/SFTP, and MySQL database.\n> * Review administrator accounts for your WordPress sites (if you have any), change their passwords, and remove unnecessary users.\n> * Update your WordPress sites (if you have any) plugins, themes, and core version, and turn on automatic updates, if applicable.\n> We appreciate your cooperation and understanding. Please let us know in case you have any questions.\n\nGetting a scrollbox for `tt` text instead sure is something.",

The problem with Notepad++ is that for a long time they did not use Authenticode, and people trusted the binary installs despite the warning from Microsoft.  People felt safe doing it because everyone seemed to use Notepad++, which is exactly what made it such a nice target for state sponsored actors.

Some consultant comes in and takes their work, they get dropped and the company carries on with everything they did. You don't own anything you do for a company.\n\nWhat I described is not the minimum expectations. I described the job as it was agreed to.\n\nWhen I offer $10 for a meal at a food shop, I don't expect the person to give me a bonus icecream to impress me and move up in the world.\n\nEmployment is a business contract. You agree to terms and get what you pay for. Thinking a company will reward you if you just bend over backwards for them and let yourself be extra-exploited more than everyone else is stupid. Not to mention a race to the bottom.\n\nMy time is worth something to me, if someone wants more of my time they can pay me for it. And I've done quite well, and held senior full stack development job roles. \n\nBeing a permanently on call, working unpaid overtime hours, wage slave, is not necessary. Be good at your job and employers will gladly accept your terms.\n\nAnd quite frankly I don't want a management level position. I see what constitutes as \"work\" for managers. Sorry I'd rather do something more rewarding.\n\nIf you have energy to do anything extra outside of agreed work hours you should be using that time to do contract work or build things that you own which can secure employment in other companies one day, build a portfolio, contribute to open source projects, etc.",

Why not?\"  \"Well... \" I say, \"I suppose I could, but this nice lady here is bending me into unnatural shapes right now, and I might say things that HR won't like...\"\n* A coworker with kidney disease.... \"They want to know why I can't fly to an offsite for a day event...  I said I could if I had my own restroom or people didn't mind the bag\"\n* My employer had strike duty -- they tried to put on a boom truck -- given I'm blind, I protested.  It took an outside source and and lawyer to explain this might be a bad idea... but the press would love it.\n* A coworker in the same strike duty -- they wanted her to climb poles.  She agreed, but only if she could drop wrenches on our CEO.  I had to explain it wasn't the loss of the CEO that was the problem -- we could always get a new one -- but the wrenches were expensive.\n* My employer had a team building event somewhere, and we were all supposed to drive there, and policy said I couldn't order car service.  They INSISTED I had to drive myself.  I tried to explain.  Finally, I offered \"Sure!  It's a rental -- I'll even pay the CDW.  I wonder if I'll make it out of the parking lot before I total the car.  By the way, I have no license.\"\n* Years ago, my VPs of engineering were gems.  I say that, because the first just went to Burning Man one day, and never returned.  The second, his replacement, who was supposed to be better, was a Harold Camping (sp?) fan.  Thus, he believed, the world was going to end in 1994.  He told everyone too.   I was on good terms with the CFO so he asked \"Well, I guess I don't need to pay him anymore, or do we havea. company lockout -- I don't know...\"\n\nStrangely enough, this happens again and again.....  One of my most favorite ones was an offsite picnic -- one of those you'd better attend and have fun OR ELSE.   We're there -- a small child comes up to our CEO and runs away in tears \"Mommy!  He's dead!  He looks like Lurch!\"  I had nothing to do with this!",

And through my whole CS education I wanted to become that sort of craftsman I kept reading about, to one day tell these stories of the types of software I built, to mentor people in writing software, to work up and eventually become a greybeard in some area. It feels like since the moment I joined (and GPT stormed the world a mere month later), I've been watching that fade into a future excluded from the set of possibilities.\n\n\nCompared to that, I must confess I'm jealous that you had your decade-plus before it fell apart. Maybe I'll one day have my own stories or variety of craftsmanship, maybe it won't all fall apart after all. Maybe I'll no longer be directly touching any code in 5 years' time. Maybe in some sense this is no different than someone in the mid-2000s watching enterprise Java take the world, saying they wish they could have been one of the GNU hackers of the 80s and 90s.\n\n\nBut I do feel a grief for that loss, at least in this moment.

Not your time, but actual money for the AI usage.\n\nSure, you can argue that it's saving you from hiring another developer.

This is true for people who see a productivity boost from AI and those that don't. Everyone just pays to write code.\n\nMost small companies will struggle with this tax if it becomes mandatory and the cost of software will reflect it.

Most real world enterprise problems just needed functional, clean-ish, workman-like level solutions. Even before AI of the last 3-4 years, people in the industry already commonly complained how most jobs were just CRUD apps, in boring businesses... craftsmanship matters, but relatively little in such contexts, when CRUD was widely recognized to be a commoditized skillset even before AI.\n\nThere used to be a lot more blacksmiths. The individual craftsmanship mattered some, and some blacksmiths could charge more than others. But the Industrial Revolution made those small individual skill differences irrelevant, and the scaling benefits of mass production were too overwhelming -- when push comes to shove, craftsmanship has to justify itself against economic reality. The mass market will not overpay for commodity items, as they shouldn't.\n\nBlacksmiths didn't disappear entirely. But it's a smaller niche now. You can either do it as a hobby, or you can make a business out of it if you've got truly exceptional craftsmanship, or if you provide something unique that I couldn't just buy off Etsy or 3D print myself or whatever a substitute good might be. \n\nThere's nothing especially different or unique about software. We might've held on to the assumption that, the forces shaping meatspace would take longer to reach into digital spaces, but we were naive if we ever thought we were totally safe forever. It's sad, but IMHO it's no more sad than any other previous wave of capitalism transforming the way people live -- we don't deserve any more or less sympathy than blacksmiths did 200 years ago. \n\nEveryone should face the music. Some may choose to continue, and invest more in their personal craft and try to add unique value, to stay ahead of the curve somehow. Others will leave the industry. And some may stubbornly ride north, and I sincerely hope they find whatever measure of satisfaction fate can afford them.",

Sharpen a knife, which is like other knives, it's just not as good because it got dull.  I'm not sure there's a very good software analogy to that... delete the malware off your Windows 95 partition?\n\nAs a user of the tools, I care when they're small and sharp and not buggy, and if I'm going to need to alter them, I care that they're the same way internally.  But ultimately it's because I care about what I can do with them, the definition of \"well designed\" from the inside means it's a pleasure to bend them into some new shape I suddenly need now.  I'm not sure how that fits in with traditional definitions of craftsmanship, but I think the analogy just doesn't fit well.  No one is going to install your bespoke program in their living room and enjoy how it smoothly copies files around for years, unlike the cheap factory built `cp` commands which corrupt them.\n\nIn terms of personal satisfaction, there's work and personal.  Work things are for someone else's end, and while some of them are nice and some of them were not nice, and of course I'd rather work on the nice ones, in the end it just affects how much time it takes for me to do something for the group.  Whether or not things are nice kind of has to do with team dynamics and politics and history and all those things mostly not under any one person's control.  If people start flooding stuff with AI and you're not down with the style, it seems not too different from getting on a team where they just don't care about the things you do.  Maybe the article is saying the overall culture is moving towards enormous wobbly piles of jello and sure fair enough I think it is, that's been a constant theme ever since Rob Pike complained about cat coming back from Berkeley waving flags.  Sloppy AI code will contribute to it, but it's just part of an overall direction that's much larger.  I kind of hate that stuff as a normal user who has to use some broken bank website, but that's just life in the modern world, it's not really about programmers in particular.\n\nBut ultimately, all work things disappear the moment you change jobs, or even the moment you turn off at 5 or whatever and go home.  This seems pretty different from a cowboy who has a lifestyle, not a job.\n\nFor personal things, which is more like lifestyle and not job, feel free to not slop it up with AI if you don't like that!  That stuff no one else will tell you how to do, it only matters how much you enjoy doing it, and whether you can use it to do whatever it is you really wanted to do with it.\n\nI guess if you're a freelancer then personal and work is mixed, and say you feel you just can't compete writing by hand, then yeah that could feel like being left behind.  But once again, maybe you're in a field where the customer doesn't care about the insides, so long as it does the thing they want it to, and maybe that's to do with the field, in the same way as team culture mismatch.",

I have a feeling that vibe coding and co. might hurt programming as a hobny too, and I'm quite sad about it. That's because  the final product, the program, not the code, that an hobbyist can make is often inferior to what the newfound competition can achieve. \n\nDespite the hobby nature of the activity, creating something useful is often important. Although I might not care about *selling* the product of my labor, or my labor-force itself, I still care about it being used, at least by me or those who I care about. I knit a sweater because I want to wear it, and even if it's not as practical as the industry made ones, it's more beautiful (as an aside, I think aesthetic value in this context can be considered *use* value, as the product generates pleasure through its beauty). The same goes with woodworking or other creative hobbies, I want to use, or at least aesthetically appreciate, the product of my labor. If it wasn't the case, if I only created purely for the pleasure I take in the *process* of creating, I'd just destroy the creation and start from scratch every time, which very few hobbyists do.\n\nWith programming, achieving this is becoming harder and harder, at least for me. Yes, one can find pleasure in the aesthetic value of the code, or even in some aspects of the final program (e.g. visual design of an UI), but I think for most hobbyists, this is not the main purpose of the creation. I think most of programming, even at the hobbyist level, is about creating some useful.\n\nUnfortunately, I think AI is hurting this, as it is becoming better than me at creating useful programs. Not only it is sidelining me economically (not much in my case, programming is on my CV and helps a bit, but I'm not a professional developer), but it's also killing my motivation to create. And it's really painful.\n\nI might still write something more about the aspects, but this is the main point I thought about while reading your comment. What do you think?",

I would say it is twofold.\n\n1. It makes our jobs faster, but dirtier. When you let AI handle the easy to do things, you have to pick up the things that the AI sucks at. I find myself going through really badly written code that is hard to understand. It sucks.\n2. AI's need training. They train on code that exists. Quality might degrade a lot over time.\n\nNow this isn't a big deal. Yeah the profession might be not as necessary anymore. You don't need as many horse breeders or farriers anymore either. But my concern is also that the job becomes worse. Instead of writing nice beautiful code the job becomes more digging through and fixing ugly poorly maintained code.

Will I still use it? Yeah, likely for help when I need to deploy something (it's surprisingly very good at deployment configurations) but for the software I develop? No way, not anymore. And this is kinda scary because I plan on making my own consultancy/startup, and I know \"not using\" AI could make me look like I'm lagging behind the rest, but at this point I value enjoying the entire process of development more than anything (not to mention that for some of the products I'm planning to develop LLMs don't know how to use certain libraries yet lol) and hell, I want my clients to know why certain decisions are taken: if I show them a bullet list made by an LLM, they are right to think \"why did we hire this bum instead of just giving an LLM what we needed?\", but I want to show people that experience from people is still insanely valuable (despite my short time in the career I've seen some things that would make most people want to retire on the spot and go open up a farm lol)\n\n\nI love the process and while I know I am \"hindering\" myself I hate the mentality of \"ship now and fix later\" because being honest that \"later\" almost never comes and people end up building on top of an already wrongly done base for their software. It makes sense to ship fast in a startup but hell, if I'm not going public, why bother lol",

I legit had an existential career crisis when this realization hit me.\n\nOnce we knew how to use Claude at that level and knew how to get proper prompting/context generation/had documented the codebase *thoroughly* with a mix of our own documentation and Claude's generated documentation (which we reviewed ourselves), Claude absolutely chewed through features and fixes. We reviewed all the code ourselves, and it wasn't always perfect, but there was no question that we became significantly more productive and faster as a team.\n\nI really do think a lot of the people who say these types of things either work in really low level languages (assembly, for example) or just do not actually know how to make Claude Code work for your codebase properly.",

I’ve rubbed around enough codebases of giant sizes to let go of the notion that there is only one way to code “beauty”.\n\nWhat the AI tools are taking away is this self referentiality; putting something out there that is a product of our own uniqueness - purportedly -  and then falling in love with that as we put more things on top. No objective value, no functional value, no organizational value is considered during this narcissistic joy. Now all the plausible deniability we had against management as to why they should pay us while bullshitting our ways around actual organizational goals is gone, and that is the thing we are grieving.\n\nThe syntax of the code is trying to approximate the grammar of the language, but the syntax of the programming activity is trying to approximate to the grammar of the information processing goals the business has at hand. The latter will not be taken away by AI, so long as business itself stays a human endeavor. And the moment AI could handle that bit there’s no economy whatsoever anyways.",

Previous automation transitions were defined by lowered manufacturing costs - but with downloadable or web hosted software the cost to produce copies of quality software remains virtually zero. It's not comparable to when linen makers got overwhelmed by lower quality products because there is no bar to mass producing higher quality products.\n\nRegardless - if the problems haven't changed the need for clever solutions also hasn't changed.

Can’t resolve problems. Can’t even add up a couple things. All it can do is be the equivalent of that man in a Chinese room. \n\nYes, AI can inherently beautify your- our- code much as it can generate pictures that appeal to our senses; they’re clean, they’re flawless in syntactic terms, and they’re also free of any semantics. \n\nIf your AI happens to generate code that matches your idea of what you were looking for, that’s literally correlation rather than causation. It may suffice for the particular situation, but it’s neither reproducible nor is it transferable; worse, perhaps, is that you gain no additional information to add to your experience. Basically, it’s a case of set-and-forget. \n\nThat therefore is the real tragedy. Not only are we at risk of being obsoleted by employers that figure AI can replace a competent software developer. (Even if it certainly can replace incompetent coders.)\n\nBut we’re also at risk of losing our hard earned competence, our knowledge, and ultimately our intelligence, if we think of intelligence as a combination of a knowledge base on the one hand and our ability to search and apply fragments of that knowledge for new solutions on the other. \n\nAI has this inherent appeal of making things easier for us; but by resigning ourselves to it, because it’ll provide answers that seem to make sense, over time, we stop questioning AI as a source of information and just accept everything at face value. \n\nAnd that’s something to be avoided at all costs, not just because it’s AI but because it means we’re stopping to think for ourselves and will then have lost all agency. We‘ll be unwitting pawns in someone else’s game. \n\nSo don’t think of competence as a tragedy or how life’s experiences were ruined by AI. \n\nInstead, think of it as noblesse oblige or, in this case, compétence oblige if you will. \n\nThink of it as someone being required to help develop AI if you prefer rather than being the one being obsoleted by it; because that will be most of those that rely on AI to get things done. \n\nBecause that’s the only way to try and direct anything. Just giving up on things and handing thought processes over to someone else actually DOES make us obsolete. \n\n— Disclaimer: NO AI was used in the creation of this post; I’m sorry to have to put this here, but I’ve been accused of being AI myself too many times in the past.",

I struggle to understand the engineers who likes programming for the tedious, non-creative part that can be delegated to AI. But they seem to be here in overwhelming numbers.\n\nSo that's odd.\n\nAI poses no threat to a creative problem solver. On the contrary,  it poses a huge opportunity. It feels the same way it felt when I first learn how to write scripts in the first place, to automate away tedious problems. The central value proposition of all machines. The reason for industry itself.\n\nDescribing this logical progression of engineering in terms of some grand romantic tragedy is so goofy to me. Is the idea that these programmers wanted to mow lawns for a living and then their moms forced them to be programmers? I understand the appeal of yard maintenance,  but you can always go do something like that after work",

I like creative problem solving (developing the whole logic to solve a problem) and I'm really surprised how many people delegate all that interesting stuff to AI so they can focus exclusively on the tedious, non-creative parts (describing work to do and reviewing written code).\n\nIt all depends on how you use AI I suppose, but like, the main selling point I've been hearing for years is \"I don't need to solve stuff myself anymore, AI does it for me.\" It really feels like the most vocal proponents of AI have no particular love for the craft and just see it as an easier lower-effort less-involved way to generate the same final result. And I can't help but wax poetic about it because that's not why I got into programming. I got into it because I actually enjoy the process of figuring shit out for myself.",

It determines everything else. On a movie set, the movie's director \"describes the work to do\" and everyone else goes and does it. It would be weird to suggest the movie's director is focused exclusively on tedious, non-creative work. \n\nThe implementation logic is kind of creative, but in the way that a sudoku puzzle is kind of creative. Yard maintenance is kind of creative if you want it to be, but you're mostly just carrying out a route set of operations. The better you get at it, the less creative it is. With implementation logic, if you get too clever about it you're likely doing something wrong. The same cannot be said of the high-level creative direction of the project.",

          "text": "Okay here’s what I have to say: \n\nFirst OP: thank for sharing this! It’s vulnerable and honest and authentic and I appreciate you! \n\nNow I myself see programming like I see art or music. It’s something that you do because you must. It’s something you explore because you want to push the boundaries of what it means to be you. It’s a process that continuously answers the question: Can I do this? Maybe it’s improvising a new style of music, or maybe it’s learning how to paint in a more impressionist style. Maybe it’s learning assembler for RISC-V. But it’s about seeing how far can you push the boundaries on what you’re capable of. \n\nI think the problem is often that there are people who, for example, love to draw. But they decide to try and become a graphic designer instead because they think it’s the safe bet. Now personally I actually love design and based on the fact I’ve spent more time doing design than oil painting I can say that for now I like it better. But this example is about someone who loves to oil paint but takes the design job. It’s not their truth. It’s them dimming there light. \n\nWhen someone isn’t living their truth and dimming their light but with the understanding that this design job pays better that’s okay; as long as they want the money because raising a family is more their truth. But if it isn’t then they aren’t truly happy. \n\nSo let’s pretend in our example that our artist working as a designer does a lot of YouTube thumbnails as a freelancer. \n\nThen when AI comes along and all of a sudden they see themselves getting less and less work. \n\nThen they are pissed. \n\nBut why? \n\nI think the real reason is that they already aren’t living their truth. The already are taking work that didn’t fulfill them. So when that work leaves they are left with their original unfaced realization: they are an artist not a designer. \n\nIf they had taken the risky road of trying to be an artist that may have been harder. It might have paid poorly. But AI wouldn’t have had the same impact because they would just continue making their art. People who buy art - like actual oil paintings - aren’t suddenly going to buy prints of AI generated images. It’s a completely different experience. They want the actual art. For a variety of reasons none of which are affected by AI generated content. \n\nLikewise I think there are programmers out there that look at programming as something you only do for money in the context of a day job. \n\nBut there are, for example, indie game developers that spend years of this life creating the game they need to create. It’s an act of love. It’s an artistic expression. And even if the game doesn’t sell a zillion copies those that do buy WANT to buy it because it is the expression of one person’s vision. \n\nThis isn’t affected by AI generated code. \n\nLike vintage computer scene coders aren’t going to use AI to code their next Commodore 64 demo. There would be no point. The person is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, both on the platform and within themselves, and the people that enjoy running and watching those demos love that whole thing in the same way. \n\nNow I haven’t read the story but if someone does something they love and can live their truth then that’s beautiful. Other people will always respond to this. It doesn’t matter if the rest of the world drives cars. There are people who love horses and want to share that love with others. \n\nIf you do something you love and live your truth, and you don’t need the outcome of that work to bring in great wealth or status or meet some need to feel extra special, then living your truth is a reward onto itself. \n\nAnd if someone is pissed that they made good money doing something they don’t love and have to get a different job that they also don’t love… well then I don’t know what to tell you. \n\nChange is a bitch. \n\nBut to those who are, or want, to live their truth then the first thing that comes to mind is this song.\n\nA Harry Chapin song that goes something like this:\n\n“But music was his life, it was not his livelihood\nAnd it made him feel so happy \nand it made him feel so good\nAnd he sang from his heart \nAnd he sang from his soul\nHe did not know how well he sang, \nit just made him whole”",

Your craftsmanship is important only insofar as it generates value for the company. I'd argue that being a good craftsman does still generate value for the company regardless of AI, as long as the engineer keeps the end goal in sight. Many engineers sadly don't or can't.\n\n2. Many of the \"problems\" I run into on a daily basis should have been solved _ages_ ago, but we keep reinventing the wheel over and over. If AI actually manages to solve them then great, but it's plainly wrong to claim that we _needed_ AI to solve them in the first place.\n\nCase in point: most web applications serve some kind of tabular data and let you change said data, usually via some kind of modal window. That we haven't universally adapted automatic code generation for something like that is plainly hilarious. It's even more hilarious that we need AI to do it when we had the tools for probably a decade or more.",

Only the hard creative and planning parts.\n\nSome places will not be heavily impacted by AI, mostly operating systems, embedded programming and console games.

Microsoft pushed it for a couple of years, and then it was abandoned\n\nSame with Adaptive Cards - a technology for dynamically building UI. When it was introduced, it was pushed heavily for a couple of years, even open-sourced, and then abandoned (though it’s still being developed quietly)\n\nThere is 90% chance that latest Widget Board would be abandoned again for whatever reason, but I have a cautions optimism here.

LLMs already have a strong preference for whatever was most popular in their training data, so you get this feedback loop where popular packages get recommended more, which makes them more popular, which makes them show up more in training data. Smaller, better-maintained alternatives just disappear from the dependency graph entirely.\n\nAnd it compounds with the security angle. Today's Supabase/Moltbook breach on the front page is a good example -- 770K agents with exposed API keys because nobody actually reviewed the config that got generated.

The tools are really good, but we still need to read what they write before it gets used by other people. \n\nOn the topic of OSS dying because of agentic-assisted software engineering - as these things get closer to the Star Trek Computer, and get faster, the ability to just rewrite everything purpose-built and customized for every task anew will trend towards keeping any source at all being less cost effective than just telling the computer in vague human language what you want it to do, and it just doing it.\n\nCode is written for humans to communicate past specifications in a completely unambiguous way so that they can evaluate the smallest amount of change to make it work, repeatedly, or with your new task, only. If it's cheap enough in money and time to generate, execute, and throw away on the fly, nobody needs to read it or maintain it at all.

LLMs already have a strong preference for whatever was most popular in their training data, so you get this feedback loop where popular packages get recommended more, which makes them more popular, which makes them show up more in training data. Smaller, better-maintained alternatives just disappear from the dependency graph entirely.\n\nI mean, a few counterpoints:\n\n1. Standardization is good.\n\n2. Sprawl is bad, arguably worse than bloat.\n\n3. This is already the case, just look at any modern web frontend.\n\n4. This is easily - even trivially - managed outside of code. Linked libraries, container layers, compile time pruning, etc.\n\n5. Most of the security risks from a supply chain perspective are already fairly well understood *because* those libraries are already in widespread use.\n\nIf libcurl has a security flaw, the whole Internet has a security flaw, and that's a big part of why they banned AI-generated PR's and have a very thorough manual human review process. \n\nMost smaller single-purpose libraries are *also* full of bugs and vulnerabilities, and oftentimes questionably maintained/well maintained until they're not. And they're also way less likely to follow the CVE process and coordinate appropriately on fixes to minimize public risk, or respond appropriately when a high severity vulnerability is discovered.\n\nThat's not to say that big popular libraries *don't* have supply chain risks and day0 incidents and all that, or that there isn't some value of having a diverse ecosystem of smaller competing libraries - but I do think that it's a bit silly to consider the alternative to be more secure.",

If you follow at least few blogs or social media I’d claim the opposite is happening at the moment.\n\n> If we consider this effect of ‘AI-assisted’ software development to be effectively the delegating of the actual engineering and development to the statistical model of an LLM\n\nAgain an interesting take. This assumes pure vibe coders are replacing proper software engineers and the AI-assisted engineers. I don’t see this happening at any company yet. The number of times I run into outdated information in an LLM is daily. Every piece of software I write with an LLM still contains bugs. If all you can do is run prompts you’ll end up programming yourself into a deep hole you can’t get yourself out of.

But finding an effect system to have some semblance of measurement of this is the real challenge.\n\nThere are options of using no measurements, but if we take time to explain to others who understand the system and measure the value of it, we would also create  extra work no one wants to do. And not having metrics for performance brings another set of problems as well.\n\nPractically having a standardized system that measures the value of individual is really the core of the issue in alot of our endeavors.\n\nAfter some thoughts, I am wondering if we look at things from another perspective, why is that engineer so valued? I think the reason why there is so much reward for the 'fixer' hero, is because systematic understanding is rare. And real time diagnostics is also a rare skill, because organization typically under invest in up keeping a real time documentation system for internal usage, and we do not test our systems under simulated failures enough. So maybe the under investment of testing and knowledge sharing is the culprit here.",

So when they go in to \"fix\" the \"disaster\", it's often just addressing the same said issue that they were warning about beforehand.  But instead of being allowed to fix it in normal working hours, they were forced to do it as part of an incident response.  And once in a while, you'll even get this backhanded \"hero\" label even when your stuff \"just works\" without any incident or user complaint.\n\nCalling someone a hero is often a cheap way for a manager to say \"thank you for fixing my mistake.\"  And everyone's resentment for the \"hero\" is often an example of Tall Poppy Syndrome.\n\nI'll give you a counter example.  I once had a bunch of product managers from other teams filing into my office one by one to complain that my product was a 100% solution when it should have been a 80% solution.  I pointed out to them my team delivered everything on time and under budget, and that every piece of functionality was carefully researched through user studies and backed by data that demonstrated the need.  I pointed out that we had planned for the operational needs before launching and that the product had a flawless uptime record over the next 12 months (it \"just worked\").\n\nMeanwhile, their projects were a year or more behind schedule, required tripled staffing, and they were pushing features that our users never asked for.  And their initial launches had to be rolled back in embarrassing scandals a week or so after launch because of severe bugs or scaling problems.  \n\nReality did not stop them from insinuating that my team had done something wrong.  We \"gold plated\" our project.  We \"squandered\" business value by pushing out something that was \"perfect\" instead of moving on as soon as it was \"good enough\". It was somehow our fault that their own projects failed.  \n\nAgain - I pointed out that my PM had brought in a UX researcher and we aggressively prioritized features based on user feedback.  And that the CEO of the company had personally vouched for the key features they were calling \"too perfect\" as a market differentiator for our company.   This only made them even more butt hurt.\n\nSo when you actually have the power to do everything the right way, instead of burning the midnight oil to fix the foreseeable problems you had warned everyone about -- they still hate you for it.",

What happens when \"Brad\" burns out? How does the team culture suffer?

I started a new job as a Sr. Director of App Dev / DevOps and the MD of Infra asked me about my thoughts on \"on-call\" . . . I told her I don't believe in it, and if you have to have \"on-call\" you are doing it wrong.  She looked at me like I had a third arm growing out of my head. \n\nAs you have shown . . . do it right the first time, and shit \"just works\", and you can actually accomplish more for the same investment.

To me, the \"bus factor\" and \"on-call\" issues aren't just cultural side effects - they are symptoms of how a department is structured.\n\nWhen a system fails because one person is missing, that’s almost certainly a failure of leadership to enforce a consistent approach to best practices. You said you're new as a Sr Director, so this is your chance to be that leadership.  Especially with today's skeleton crews, you can’t just hope for quality; you have to build the appropriate standard of care into the daily workflows so the product doesn't rely on a single \"hero\" to survive.\n\nI actually disagree that the solution to on-call is to \"not believe in it.\" In my experience, you improve morale by taking on-call more seriously, not less. We treated the on-call rotation as a high-value engineering task.  That person was pulled from feature work specifically to triage logs, document technical debt, and conduct formal handoffs.  Handoffs were presided by a staff engineer or a skip level manager -- to give them the visibility they deserved.  If an engineer identified a bug or some tech debt during one of these meetings, the first thing you'd ask them is \"where's the ticket?\" because it was meant to get prioritized and sorted.\n\nBy treating that on-call as \"real work,\" we reduced error logs by orders of magnitude within months and drastically improved the MTTR for the entire department. We got to the point where we were finding and helping fix bugs in vendor platforms because our own internal \"noise\" was so low. One of my *frontend developers* was invited to a luncheon by our observability vendor and given an award for helping fix their agent compatibility on certain Docker container OS's. That’s how you actually eliminate the 3 AM page—not by ignoring the rotation, but by using it to aggressively burn down the technical debt that causes the fires in the first place.\n\nAs for the ETL/data issues, I've found that those teams often struggle because they aren't held to the same standards as the app dev teams. If 9/10 issues are coming from \"junk data,\" it’s a sign that the ETL process lacks the same rigor and proactive refactoring we expect everywhere else.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can’t just rant against the politics; you have to implement the processes that improve the working culture.  And you have to do it even though you know it's an uphill battle that will all get tossed to the wayside with the next set of layoffs.  You just do it.  And for what it's worth, everything I just described to you was completely fumbled when the best practices I introduced for my department were attempted at the company level, with people above my pay grade formed a committee to institutionalize everything I had done.  It eventually made me quit that job.  C'est la vie.",

It's a lot easier to campaign on the fact a crumbling bridge was fixed rather than preemptive measures were taken. Given that this is the reality of the situation I'm not sure of the fix. I've always been a fan of the elegance of economic tools like insurance. Insurance is used to hedge risk and the more incidents occur the higher the monthly premium is and vice versa for less incidents. I'm curious how a tech team would react to a production incident insurance policy where the currency is made up but the consequences are real. I think the team would take more preventative measures than they would otherwise.",

          "text": "I am exposed to quite a few robotics companies. This is exactly the difference between the good and the bad ones. \n\n* The bad ones have to send either engineers, or at least firefighting technicians out with every robot. Maybe, some local firefighter can take over. You see these robots operating with a group of engineers crowded around either a few laptops, looking nervous and anxious, or you see them pulling at the guts of the robot which is sitting open infront of them. Always, the interiors of these robots seem very \"engineered\" at a glance, but then you start to ask, \"Why are there 3 rows of $200 each waterproof connectors inside the robot and cables with 50A carrying capacity where there should be data lines?\n\n* The good ones have a shipping department who hand their robots to a courier and forget it exists. They never hear any complaints from the customer, questions, etc. The thing just works. \n\nWhen you look inside the good robots, they are elegant as hell. Very few wires going anywhere, cheapest components possible (not cheap, just cheapest possible) etc. This because this robot was genuinely engineered. As in the engineers did their jobs. They didn't just blob together a bunch of barely tested experiments, which all promptly failed, which was solved by making those failure points thicker, faster, stronger etc. For example, why are there so many wires? Poor planning. Why are they so thick? Because of weird surges for unknown reasons; plus something was super noisy, so thick shielding. Why the waterproof connectors inside? Because water is getting in somehow. And on and on.\n\nExcept, when you are shipping a large volume of products, and want to keep increasing that volume, you can't be firefighting; if you are, it will keep you small.\n\nThere are some other costs to a heroics dependent company:\n\n* On-boarding is forever because you need to know so much to be useful. Often the heroics are required because of a giant legacy spaghetti mess where new people are told, \"Don't tug on that, you don't know what it is attached to.\"\n\n* The heroes are required to make progress with the software, but are also required for installs, and then for regular disaster maintenance, thus, aren't there to make much progress. This makes even development an exercise in firefighting.\n\n* As the OP said, that the heroics are rewarded. This is also because the company knows how screwed it is when a hero leaves. \n\n* This sort of culture comes from the top. So, even when a kind of break shows up managers would rather the heroes work on some manager's pet project rather than go back and shore things up with unit tests or something else. \n\n* Since everything is a crisis, people aren't doing much measuring. Thus, where are the bugs coming from, who really is a hero, how much progress is being made on the core product, why won't management fire Adam who is a giant misogynist and a crap coder?\n\n* Managers in such a culture become extreme micromanagers. Everything is a crisis, but they can't be the ones taking the blame. They are often being badgered to deliver this or that, in ever shifting priorities, because it will trigger payments which will let the company make payroll.\n\n* This last means you have micromanagers who are endlessly gantt horny, but at the same time, change what people are assigned based on the crisis of the hour. Then get angry that people aren't living up to the gantt charts, \"Yeah, I'm going to need you to come in on the weekend; you can't be letting the team down on this.\n\n* In a genuine attempt to stop the pain, these micromanagers will go from Agile, to PMI, to \"Hey I just watched a video on Prince2\" with the key that they won't adopt any system which doesn't have them as a micromanager.\n\n* Every jira ticket now has 800 fields because of all the above project management systems adding a few more with each failed attempt to implement them. The managers marked them all as mandatory.\n\nDue to the inevitable probability of some of the fires taking too long to put out, or even failing to put out, the company can't scale, a sales dry spell, a cancelled customer; the company will occasionally run into a cash flow wall. A cunning CFO can spin these plates for some time, but eventually, you will get a convergence of events which require another layoff. \n\nThese heroics companies will generally cough and sputter along for years and years, with a layoff about every 18 to 24 months. Then, they either merge or die. Often, the death is masked as a merger, in that one of their customers is so dependent upon their crap, that they demand they merge with one of their solid vendors, who then immediately begins a migration to software which works.\n\nAlong this path to death, they will occasionally have \"great success\" an opposing confluence of events where good sales, line up with lots of payments, and maybe some other bonus. The management start talking about doubling staff over the next 6 months as now they can \"grow\". This ends in tears. \n\nSome of these companies latch on like a blood sucker to some accidental profit printer. Now they can't overly screw it up. It doesn't mean they are any good, but that it is nearly impossible to go down the toilet with this profit factory hosing money into their pockets. Companies like this then fool people into thinking they've got their act together. All this means is that some decade a competitor will do things properly and eat their lunches.\n\nI find most of the red flags for these nightmares surrounds meetings:\n\n* Lots of meeting rooms with scheduling systems.\n* First thing stand ups.\n* Lots of people who's only job is to have meetings with developers. They produce no measurable value; but are paid well.\n* Pizza for people who work on weekends and evenings.\n* When people leave, hero or not, nobody really notices. This is like a house being on fire, people don't notice when the napkin holder catches fire as they try to fight the raging inferno in 8 other rooms.\n* Gantt charts and demands for highly detailed estimates on everything.",

This doesn't have to be anything grandiose, but what if . . . \n\nManagement was able to say, \"Brad reduced the risk of this module, by refactoring it and minimizing the blast radius of a future change\", or \"Suzy reduced the 'bus factor' of this module by decomposing it into its constituent parts so that more people are knowledgeable of the code\", or \"Joseph reduced the change correlation rate of the Billing Module by refactoring it to be stateless\".\n\nThis can only occur with data though.  This can only occur if you know the before and after state.  So rather than rewarding the person who IS an SME in the system (because they have been working on it for years), we use data to celebrate those that may not implement that whiz bang new UI component, but those that ENABLE the entire team to be more effective.  The stability of a system is not just its \"up time\" or \"error rate\"; the system includes THE PEOPLE that support it, and the amount of effort / risk that the PEOPLE themselves represent (and I don't mean from a skill issue, but think SME getting run over by a bus, or someone is a \"single thread\" for multiple areas of a solution).\n\nIn my opinion, its the ones that \"make life better for everyone\" (allowing code changes to occur faster, with less risk . . . reducing the testing surface due to isolation, for examples), that have a GREATER impact (financially, and even culturally) to the organization, than those that are the 1x per quarter \"heroes\".\n\nI AM NOT saying that both types are not needed on a team, but its about democratizing contributions, and not just those that are \"most visible\".  Because lets be real, when my web team had to deal with an \"outage / incident\" . . My VP was notified, my CIO was notified, and I'm willing to bet it made the CEO's desk.  So who was \"recognized\"? \n\n\"The web team had an incident, and it was resolved in 45 minutes, when Brad identified a mis-configuration on one of the 3 servers.  Post mortem to occur\" <- probably a pretty standard update from the CIO right?  And even if \"Brad\" isn't directly mentioned, it was for this App that was Aligned with this business unit, and we all know that \"Brad\" is the SME in that area.\n\nDoes this help?  Again, my opinion, but I do think that DATA is how we get there.  Hell, DevOps was supposed to be a \"data driven decision making 'philosophy'\" to begin with.",

Measurable upstream impact.\n- **Post-mortems that celebrate prevention.** 'We had zero incidents in Q3 because  refactored the payment service proactively.' Same spotlight, different behavior.\n\nThe hardest part is changing what gets discussed in 1:1s and promoted in calibration. If managers only surface crisis responses, that's what gets optimized for.

The pattern that actually works: humans define the architecture and encode it as constraints (types, lint rules, test suites), AI generates implementations within those constraints, and a fast verification loop catches mistakes before they compound. The human's job becomes building and maintaining the guardrails, not writing the code. Without that layer, you just get fast-generated garbage.",

Those are immediately stress-tested, researched, expanded, and clarified by the agent.\n\nActing as the driver has made me a better planner, engineer, and communicator. I still reject ideas when they are wrong, but that critical evaluation is now formalized in the updated plan instead of in my head. The result so far is work that is better thought out, better implemented, and significantly easier to explain to others. Overall, it’s leading to sturdier designs and fewer downstream corrections. So far anyway!\n\nI am still very cautious and I don’t give it full access by any means. Everything is still vetted by my eyes, and I always make sure to understand every concept it builds.

HR started complaining that we might have to migrate out or have another server instance and move some employees to a different entity... etc.. \n\nand for shit sake.. I decided to RDP in and have a look, while calling the support team. The server barely had ram or cpu load. ram was like less than 14GB and cpu was mostly 1-2% usage. \n\nIn processes list, they were running SQL express. I asked the support tech why sql express and if they are aware it's limited to 1GB of ram.. apparently that's why they picked it. Because it wouldn't use more than 1 GB of ram. \n\nfuck it.. let's see what's SQL is doing .. turns out it was mostly executing a stored procedure... pull it up.. \n\nFUCK.. it was a mega store procedure.. no it was the entire business logic store procedure. \n\na 1200+ line store procedure that was mostly pulling data into variables and \"If/else\" all inside a single transaction/commit. along with old code commented out. \n\n  \nI closed it.

The fact that such evidence is not actually found (especially when actively sought) serves to affirm our belief in that theory.\n\nWith that in mind - a good code may be easy to delete, but as long as it's not actually deleted we know it's good _and relevant_ code (because it's still needed in the codebase)",

We own them, but no urgent development is needed for them.\n\nTo keep things fresh, it’s multiple services running on top of  micro size instances of managed postgres in AWS. AWS has this nice feature where you can buffer disk I/O credits and cpu credits from when you need them, so can have the occasional heavy query still getting executed fairly fast. \n\nOn top of that they have made a bunch of terrible database crimes that cause full table scans all the time. As long as the tables are small enough, they stay cached in ram, queries are still fast enough and everything looks fine. \n\nOnce those table grow big enough though, each query causes part of the table to get evicted from ram, causing a bit of I/O on disk. \n\nInitially it just uses part of the buffer during office hours and then the buffer refills. \n\nThen people working late start getting timeouts because the buffer is empty. After they stop working for a bit, and report it is down, it starts responding again.\n\nThen things start timing out during the late afternoon working hours, but redeploying things helps. And when you check things out in the morning, everything runs fine.\n\nBefore x-mas we took a closer look at one of the services, and found a routine that look for things added in the last 5 mins, but the timestamp column doesn’t have an index on it, so it needs to scan the entire log table.\n\nThis week another of these services started doing the same thing, so we immediately looked at the database. The entire service consists of storing ‘items’ with their ‘itemlines’.\n\nBrainiac A decided that a many-to-many relation was the right implementation for this. \n\nBrainiac B decided that when you need to lookup all itemslines by item id, the correct way was to go though all the item lines, join them to the item-to-itemlines table, and then filter out any itemlines where the item id on the item-to-itemlines entity didn’t match the item id you are looking for. There is a covering index on the item-to-itemline table that would solve this with a lookup, but they managed to write the C# code in a way that ensured that EF didn’t use it by accident.",

How long is the wait for each update? I'd expect waiting for a single update on any reasonable configuration to take like at most 2ms or something of that order, or say 500 updates per second. Not great, but it'd work. Even if we'd assume much worse performance at 50 updates per second, why would that take 5+ minutes? Do they really need to update 50 x 5 x 60 = 15,000 users? Or is there any reason a simple user update takes about 20ms?\n\nGiven that the bulk operation completed in 300ms I'd say there's probably something else going on that slowed the updates in that loop and that the loop was just the place where it had the biggest visible impact",

Thousands of lines of code.\n\nBut it was the very first part that caught my attention - it took a batch of records, and then did ‘foreach ( Record record in batch ) new Thread(handleRecord, record).start() ‘.\n\nIn other words, it spun up one thread for each record in the batch, of which there could be hundreds or even thousands. I’m sure it worked fine for the guy’s three-record test code, and then choked on real data.\n\nI replaced it with ‘ThreadPool.start’ and it went from fifteen minutes to about thirty seconds.

This worked fine when there were only 3 test items in each drop down but when there were several hundred and 5 or 6 drop-down on a screen it started to take significant time.\n\nI wrote a routine that took the list, turned it into a DOM object once and provided that object to the UI to use directly.  Screen transition went from 30 seconds to effectively instantaneous.  It was a simple fix but nobody had thought to try the UI with anything other than toy-data and the code review didn't catch the wildly inefficient design.\n\nThe exec's were thrilled with the miraculous fix and I was a hero. :-)",

In my opinion the people who think that what agents produce is 'good enough' are the people who have no love for the craft at all and just quite simply don't care. 'As long as it works I don't give a damn' type of folks. But if you're anything like me, someone who really cares about the quality of their work, and about their own personal growth at the craft, it's all kinds of gross.\n\nPersonally I've decided that LLMs are great learning tools, being able to not only search for information but ask questions, bounce around ideas, describe things and get them automatically expanded upon or summarised, etc, is very handy. It's now an additional tool in my toolbox along with various docs, websites, books, youtube channels, etc. If I need to learn a new language, it is very handy to be able to ask it something like, 'Show me a simple Hello World in this language and explain each line'. I think that's a good use for the tech.\n\nAnd for coding tasks, if I use an LLM for actual code it's for what you said, small discrete tasks. A template of something, a single function, a test, etc. Or simple text edits. \"Translate all the English words in this HTML into French\" \"Generate a simple CMake Template with these requirements: \" \"Write a function to convert an RGB colour to a HSL colour\", etc. Small tasks, so I can review the results, adjust them if needed, and add them to a project.\n\nI'm always watching the output carefully, and also trying to keep the number of times I use it somewhat low. I'll use it for speeding up tedious tasks that offer me no great learning experience when I'm on the clock, but if I got the time to do something myself, and it's 'actual proper coding work' that could help me personally keep growing my skills or at least practice something I haven't done for a while, I'd rather do that myself. All skills are perishable, you use them or lose em, I don't want to rely to LLMs to the point that I start to forget how to write code.\n\nAnd if that makes me 'old man yells at cloud.jpg' then fine, I don't care.\n\nI look at some folks who talk about letting coding agents go ham on their whole repositories, even doing commits, writing absolutely everything, with no guard rails, generating stuff that's full of technical debt, bugs, and not giving a damn, spinning in their chair while the water supply of an entire lake is consumed by a data centre somewhere generating tens of thousands of lines of junk code, while they don't bother to learn a single thing at all about coding and I just think... if that's what being a developer means in the future, I'm going to have to start introducing myself as something less embarrassing, like maybe a used cars salesman, or drug dealer.",

It feels like progress because nothing's slowing you down. \n\nBut nothing's checking you either.\n\nOne thing that's helped me: before accepting complex AI code, I ask it to explain what it wrote back to me. Not as a test for the AI. As a test for me. If I can't follow the explanation, I don't understand the code well enough to own it.\n\nSounds obvious. But when you're in the \"just 5 more minutes\" loop, you skip it. You accept because it looks right and the tests pass.\n\nThe abstraction bloat thing is real too. AI will scaffold 1,000 lines where 100 would do. You have to actively push back—\"couldn't you just...\"—and it immediately simplifies. But if you don't ask, it won't offer.

But most of the code today is written within big organizations with massive monopolies or duopolies etc. where customers stay not because of quality but because of lack of alternatives.",

If you fire the whole QA department, the software won't automatically break the next day or the next week.

It's not unlikely that such management will be long gone before the delayed penalty for their decisions actually resurface.\n\nI've also seen a case where development and maintenance were split between two managers.

          "text": "I like to share this article when discussing quality: https://martinfowler.com/articles/is-quality-worth-cost.html .  Quality and speed is a false trade off beyond a month or so.\n\nThe original post has a rather expansive definition of quality that includes how intuitive things are for users.  That seems reasonable for it to be a product call, as usually they can evaluate that with similar insight as an engineer.\n\nWhat they can't assess easily is the quality of the code base.  But often engineers speak of quality as something separate from business value.  It's not: as Martin Fowler points out, quality allows you to build faster and with fewer bugs.  The difficulty is that it's often hard to directly measure and you may have to use strong anecdotes and some degree of trust.  But there are projects where you can measure fairly directly: pipeline velocity, defects per engineer per month, and such.\n\nSometimes I use sharpening the axe as an analogy.  Yeah, maybe I can bludgeon the next tree down and maybe even faster than it would take for me to sharpen my axe and cut this one tree down.  But I know you want me to deal with the whole forest and it will be faster if you let me sharpen my axe first.\n\nAI has been interesting and you might be able to use enthusiasm for it to your advantage.  AI rarely gets it right at first and benefits from fast iteration cycles and extensive test coverage with useful feedback.  It also benefits from good documentation and names that make sense.",

At the same time, the capability to deliver updates almost instantaneously over the Internet means that careful screening for bugs and performance issues is considered unnecessary.

          "text": "There are a few issues: \n\nOne is that you often have to work within a pre-existing codebase or system and often the quality is really bad. So there's not much you can do at that point, because the changes you're making are usually quite small.\n\nThe other problem is that the few times that you might be asked to build a new system from scratch, often the deadline is really rushed for some reason. For maintaining old code, often the deadlines are quite relaxed or non-existent, but for building a new project from scratch, managers always seem to want really clear timelines and then they check in with you constantly and basically apply a lot of pressure. Maybe part of it is that they know that maintenance development is less desirable, so they feel compelled to treat you nicer, whereas new development is more desirable so they feel like they can pressure you more without you leaving. Idk.\n\nAnd the final issue is that on these new projects, often your teammates will sort of go insane, they may have never really gotten the chance to write much code from scratch, so they almost go into this mania where they're writing tons and tons of code, like the sheer act of typing in the code is the goal for them and they create these super verbose codebases with tons of boilerplate, pointless tests, every wacky abstraction they read about in a book, every obscure language or framework feature, etc. It's almost an orgy of coding where the codebase just explodes with thousands and thousands of lines of this stuff.",

Because one key factor is the theory built between people. If we keep switching people around, or we keep switching targets, or teams or goals, it gets hard to get good at anything, or get any vision of where you are doing. You begin to to thrash, stumble, flail and then burn out as you never see anything you do have success, you never get closure and never leave the stress fight-flight.\n\nFinally impossible dead lines. Note that I am fine with impossible dead lines as long as everyone agrees they're impossible. Moon-shots or stuff like that. Where the goal isn't to achieve it, but to see how much you can achieve. Honestly timeboxing tasks into time way too short to finish it, but enough to get a gist of it being worth to invest the whole time or not is super useful. But I'll take it for what it probably is meant as: impossible *expectations*. That's just setting yourself up for failure and frustration. You may do the most amazing thing you've ever done in your career, and you'll have someone listing how it felt short (even if no one else would ever have gotten closer) that's just deflating. If we celebrate how far we made it, then I can be inspired to push a little bit further just to see where we can end up.\n\nAI is a tool, you use it or not. If it scares you, that's fine, it's a scary moment where we need to rethink our careers. But it's part of the ever changing world of tech. The only issue is if you're being forced to use it, or forced to use it in bad ways, but that isn't AI, that's *bad management*. Toxic Coworkers are a pain, but you can avoid them and let them sink on their own, the only issue is when you're forced to deal with a toxic coworker in a toxic manner and are forced to not use any recourse against the situation, but that isn't the toxic worker, that's *toxic management*. So again, really bad management is the core issue (because impossible deadlines are bad management, and turnover is a management strategy).",

              "text": "In my experience the issue is *every single time* a misunderstanding and abuse of inheritance and the *\"is-a\"* relationship, including with OP's example. They start off with the \"you should model real world\" rule and then they fail to do so and then blame the tool.\n\nThe problem is that just because something *is* something else **in the English spoken language** doesn't mean that it *physically is* that thing as well. For example: My coffee mug *is* red in everyday spoken language, but in reality my coffee mug itself isn't the color \"red\", rather its surface material *has a* color attribute with the value of red. \"Is-a\" vs \"has-a\" is a surprisingly good rule when tackled from the *physics* point of view and not from the English language pov.\n\nIn OP's case the blog post starts off with \"both employees and managers are humans, so let's create a Human base class\" which is already terribly wrong. When a new company hires me, or when I simply change my position in a company, I don't suddenly physically morph into an entity of a different class in the real world. No, I'm the exact same human being and simply my *role within a company* changed. When modeling the real world I'm still a human and not some worker entity, my work isn't my identity.\n\nA better way would be to have a Human class with a *roles* attribute, and both Employee and Manager would be *roles*. Then you could just change `someHuman.roles.insert(new Manager())` or whatever.\n\n**But even that is incorrect,** because physically and biologically a human being doesn't have a list of \"work roles\" when it's born, rather it's a flexible being that can do any number of various tasks at various times. No, it's actually the *company* that cares about my role:\n\n    class Human {\n        Date birthDay\n        Decimal height\n    }\n    \n    class Company {\n        // Just one way to model it, but now these can contain duplicates.\n        List<Human> employees\n        List<Human> managers\n    }\n\nThere, problem solved.\n\nNow this is often overkill and you notice that you don't actually want to model the real world too accurately because it would lead into a lot of extra work and code (because real world ~~is complex~~ has high complexity), but at that point you need to draw proper domain boundaries and not blame OOP for your bad choices.\n\nFor example, from an accounting perspective you don't actually care if the workers are humans in the first place, for all you care they could be aliens or robots. What you really care about are the *contracts* and *identification* (like SSN) and the *roles within the company*. At this point there is zero reason to try to model a biological *Human* into your code anymore, and thus you once again get rid of the inheritance problem.\n\n**TL;DR:** It's not the tool that's broken, it's the users.",

But not related to common data.   \nI use the DOES-LIKE relationship instead of a IS-A relationship.\n\nFor components it is common to have a draw() function. For data-entities to have a store() and load() function. It also has downsides.     \nWhile you can also use a swtich/case statement to split up each operation when you have one big draw() function. But then this function also needs to know everything about the components that you are drawing.   \nWith a class-related draw() one can dig deeper into the complex state of a component. And one can easily add a large set of new components. In some cases 100s of components are very common. But this draw() function also needs to know how to draw things. Which gets extreme if you have a complex graphics system.  \nSo there is some balance.\n\nIn practice people often mix components and data-entities. They can describe the same thing, especially in games. But they also relate to different \"Domains\". One is related to drawing. And one is related to internal data. For example, the money on an account, can also be a number on a screen. It is not the same thing.",

Do you understand that something can be an engineering marvel that massive pushed the bar for technological standards, yet at the same time be implemented in a way that is awful?\n\nDOOM is trivially portable to anything because one of the better decisions Carmack made at the time was to make use of the linker to abstract away the platform specific stuff. The game itself is written in a very platform agnostic way. This is something they kept doing going forward in future games.\n\nBut DOOM is an absolute mess otherwise. Almost every single variable in the source code is global, functions have absolutely zero idea of staying in their own lane and will modify memory in sections of the game that they really shouldn't be touching. \n\nCarmack himself has criticized this aspect of the game, and is a bit of a pure function extremist these days.",

The author’s “prickly” attitude and eagerness to trash on reasonable concepts aren’t doing the post any favors.\n\nAside from the style, the contents of the post provide pretty mediocre advice. \n\nWe all know that overuse of inheritance hierarchies is bad. That’s nothing new. Neither is the idea that one should wait until there are multiple examples of code being used before trying to generalize them.\n\nWhat’s unusual in here is the idea that good code is code which has been compressed as much as possible. An interesting idea! Which I have seen go wrong many times.\n\nThe approach of removing duplication wherever possible often leads to tight coupling between conceptually different things. Textual similarity between multiple pieces of code is not a good enough reason alone to try to unify them under a single abstraction, because things which have been unified in this way are now coupled. Uncoupling them later if the need arises is frequently harder than if they were never combined at all. To borrow a phrase, “No abstraction is better than the wrong abstraction.”\n\nHow do you know when this unification should be performed? By thinking about the concepts behind the code. What forces are in play, what the code _means_, how the code has evolved up until this point, what your project manager has in your backlog, etc. This doesn’t mean preemptively building a framework to account for all of these things; it means deferring decisions which are hard to undo unless you have a reason to believe that they won’t need to be undone. This is exactly the kind of thinking that the post is mocking.\n\nFinally,\n\n> The fallacy of “object-oriented programming” is exactly that: that code is at all “object-oriented”. It isn’t. Code is procedurally oriented, and the “objects” are simply constructs that arise that allow procedures to be reused.\n\nThis is laughable and expresses an extremely limited perspective on the wide range of ways which code can be structured and understood.",

Each new feature (workspaces, monitoring, documentation) increases surface area for bugs and complexity, while potentially confusing new users about what the product actually does.\n\nThe counterargument: APIs are inherently a full lifecycle problem. If you're testing an API, you probably also need to document it, monitor it, mock it for development. The question is whether one tool should own that entire stack or whether best-of-breed specialized tools win.\n\nSo far, vertical integration has worked better for developer tools than \"super apps\" - but Postman's market position is strong enough they might be the exception.",

Maybe I wasn't clear.\n\nJetBrains has a built-in [HTTP client ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/http-client-in-product-code-editor.html)that can - among other things - do exactly what Postman does. At least at a basic level. The file is just text formatted in a particular way.\n\n    POST https://ijhttp-examples.jetbrains.com/post\n    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n    \n    field1=value%+value&field2=value%&value\n\nWhat I used AI to do was make a quick and dirty CLI web scraper. Scraped their API docs and put it in a text file. They were great docs. Showed how to call every endpoint in a dozen ways. Including the format I needed.\n\nNow that file with all the endpoints and options is in my project. One and done.\n\nCould I have copied and pasted each one? Sure. But that's tedious and my company mandates the use of AI so this seemed like a great use of it. Do something quickly that removes tedium and supports the actual work.\n\nI use it for generating dummy data. Like a 40 line CSV with very real looking data.\n\nOur stack has factories and seeders for generating test data. No business logic. It's based entirely off the defined entity. It's amazing at that because it's just applying the documentation. And to be honest it does better than me. I'll typically only write enough options to do what I need to do. It will make a fully fleshed out version with all options. Unless I change the underlying entity we never have to touch it again.\n\nMy opinions on AI do not matter. If I want to keep my job I must adopt it. And I'm trying to approach it like every other tool that I've been introduced to.  Use its strengths and avoid its weaknesses. Poke and prod and tweak so it fits my personal workflow.\n\nI've spent a lot of time setting up the config. Defining standards. Putting in guardrails. The more I use it the more I can recognize when its having a problem. When I need to pivot. I'm doing my best to maintain the standards I have worked to set before AI was mandated.\n\nI can either sit here and be a piss-pants about being force to use it or take ownership of it.

For most desktops, that default is being centered.\n\nIt not being in the last location may upset some people. Personally, I don't like windows opening up in their last locations. Or rather, I hate when apps choose to always open in nonsensical places, neither centered nor where they were last open.\n\n> Some popups, such as Search Everywhere and Recent Locations, may not be moved outside of the main frame.\n\nThat's not a Wayland thing. For whatever reason, they just decided that popups must be contained inside the window. Probably so that they can have more control over where things pop up?\n\n> Window decorations (such as the title bar, window control buttons, shadows, and rounded corners), where present, may not fully adhere to the current desktop theme\n\nYeah that one is harder to defend. Titlebar and window rounding, I don't really care. But inconsistent shadows, or complete lack of shadow makes the window feel \"off\".",

Most desktop environments will allow windows to supply their own decorations if they wish but will provide a default implementation on the server side as an alternative. GNOME, in their infinite wisdom, have decided that all clients must provide their own decorations, and if a client does not, they will simply be missing. I disagree with this decision; Factorio does not need to provide decorations on any other platform, nay, on any other desktop environment, but GNOME can (ab)use its popularity to force programs to conform to its idiosyncrasies or be left behind.\n> \n> To fix this, I had to bring in another dependency, libdecor. It functions, and SDL even has support for it, but a video game shouldn't have to supply window decorations in the first place.",

Notably, Poland's market has grown significantly and now competes closely with Germany.\n* **Work Arrangements**: There is a noticeable reduction in fully remote roles as employers increasingly favor hybrid work models.\n* **Experience Gap**: Demand has shifted toward senior experts in specialized areas like Data Engineering and Mainframe development, while junior positions are making up a shrinking share of new openings.\n* **Hiring Process**: Job seekers report frustration with \"ghosting\" (reported by nearly half of candidates) and lack of salary transparency. Candidates overwhelmingly prefer a streamlined 2-stage interview process.\n\n# Impact of AI\n\n* **Productivity vs. Pressure**: While 90% of employees use AI tools to some extent to boost productivity, 53% report increased workplace performance demands because of them.\n* **Job Security**: Most IT professionals (79%) do not feel threatened by AI taking their jobs in the next five years.\n* **Adoption**: AI is becoming a standard \"assistant\" for coding and job hunting, but human verification remains essential; only a minority trust AI-generated code completely.\n\n# Reality for Juniors\n\n* **Barriers to Entry**: 76% of juniors believe entry-level roles require excessive experience.\n* **Education**: 85% of respondents hold a university degree, though 42% believe it is helpful but not strictly essential to enter the industry.\n* **Search Success**: Most juniors (58%) secure their first role within three months, primarily through job boards (39%) and personal networks (29%).\n\n# Average IT Salaries by Country (Gross Annual)\n\n* **Switzerland**: 106,900 CHF (\\~114,383 EUR).\n* **United Kingdom**: 65,000 GBP (\\~74,100 EUR).\n* **Germany**: 62,400 EUR.\n* **Netherlands**: 55,700 EUR.\n* **Poland**: 268,300 PLN (\\~61,709 EUR).\n* **Romania**: 14,100 RON/month net (\\~32,148 EUR/year net).",
