(That is, it is more work to write than to read!) ...  \n\n> If, however, prose is LLM-generated, this social contract becomes ripped up: a reader cannot assume that the writer understands their ideas because they might not so much have read the product of the LLM that they tasked to write it.\n\nThe breaking of a social contract is a very accurate way of describing this, in my opinion. LLM usage can go beyond typical rudeness, they create situations with *epic* levels of time wasted by professionals in similar positions to the curl team.\n\n[0] https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0576",

As a corporation one of their main (unstated) goals is to eliminate the competition. Eventually these companies will care about the economics of AI, but for now they're driven by the fear of an upstart like OpenAI getting a toehold and becoming the next big platform.

Same project, cleaning things up a bit and factoring out a portion of the app into a separate file took 4 full days. Arguaby, it might have been quicker to use an LLM to rewrite that component from scratch and then integrate it.\n\nThis has three major implications: \n\n(1) vibe coding has a natural limit, when code complexity has increased so much that forward progress on prototypes even with LLM support stalls because every step breaks as much as it adds\n\n(2) the deferred/maintenance cost of LLM supported coding is tremendous, and as so often in software engineering, the immediate measurable (lines of code/progress # of features) doesn't accurately reflect the total cost (surprise bug trail and much larger maintenance costs)\n\n(3) Experienced software engineers controlling and pushing back against poorly orthogonalized changes from LLM agents have major value in development going forward. They provide a way to control the snowballing maintenance costs, but of course that comes at a cost of slower upfront development.",

Kinda like a paid apprenticeship thing.\n\n\nThat sort of model, I think, would work particularly well with outreach to communities that traditionally don't have a lot of opportunities available to them. I don't know if, for example, the American Indian tribes or some of the towns in Japan who are having trouble with all the young people moving away might be interested in hosting a local office for a program like that.\n\n\nEven with this AI thing and hiring at a standstill, the industry is still complaining that they can't find qualified programmers.

Cont xt window was still at 25% but even compacting it  didn't work, and a new session tried to either re-refractor already refractored code or make completely insane decision. \n\nI guess it worked fine on my original code but I got problem trying to work on their own.\n\nSpent the next couple of days manually fixing all the dumb decisions the agent made during the 1 day of refactoring.\n\nIssues I had with the code were, in no particular order:\n\n- Non consistent syntax \n\n- Duplicated code (similar to a very junior programmer a lot of copy paste the same 30 line function and change one line  instead of changing the behavior of the one function to accept both cases)\n\n- Questionable architectural decisions (just things that worked, but that you know its going to give you problem in the long run if you do it like that)\n\n- Insanely defensive code ( up to declare a variable with a magic number and then check if it is initialized in the next line)\n\n- Hidden and purposely sneaky errors. (One of the errors i pointed out turns out he fixed it by adding a check at the beginning of the function that basically always returned true in an obfuscated way but didn't actually run)\n\n- Random bugs and small quirks added that only becomes clearer once you actually start to use the program \n\n\nA lot like AI images when you see them you see that they are AI, but you cant put your finger on it. until you start pay attention and you see the 7 fingers and the weird nonsensical stuff in the background.\n\nStill better than Claude 4 was (last one I tried a couple of months before, when everyone was saying that programming is over for humans). But I'll wait for claude 5 next, people say 4.5 is there with Gemini 3, but I dont think is close enough that even if it is slightly better might make me more efficient.\n\nRight now its just slowing me down.\n\nI still use auto completion, always did, I like it because when the code is terrible is a keystroke to delete it and I control the full context and can fix it in the moment instead of having to wait for to go back and tey to understand what the fuck they did.",

But I wanted it to create real artifacts to make this code work and be able to be tested.\n3. Compile under X86 instead of the architecture it was needed for.. .ALSO stub out the code... because why not bring back a bad idea for a third round (probably even higher than that). \n4. Rewrite cmake from the ground up so it would work like yocto   (Literally asked it \"Are you serious?\"  And it realized that was a fucking stupid idea... ) \n\nMy point being... it's GREAT when you haven't read the docs, or you don't want to figure out the build system every time, and you need to push something to git.   It's awful when you run into a problem that isn't already documented somewhere else. \n\nSo no... Ai is not Ready to replace Junior Developers, and it's OBVIOUSLY not.   \n\nAnd again I like AI, I think it's a very useful tool, but it's a useful TOOL.  It's the user of the tool that's responsible.   It makes you more effective, it doesn't replace anyone. \n\nBut anyone who thinks otherwise....well either isn't making it do something interesting or novel or unique, or has gotten EXTREMELY lucky and never really tested it outside of that one point.\n\nPS. That story about \"AI figured out what took us 6 months to figure out.\"  I would put SERIOUS heavy money on the fact that ... the AI read their design documents....    \n\nAlso that example?  it created a prototype, if they could only make a prototype in 6 months... that's a bad sign on them.\n\nEdit: Got another story \"Let's use Sqllite instead of Mysql for local dev.\" ... spoiler, a lot of the migration scripts were designed for mysql.. THATS WHY WE DONT CHANGE DATABASES ON A FUCKING WIM.   Oh and it didn't use mysql, it used mariadb... ugh.",

So much code is vanishing by properly using postgres\n* And while rust is not a common web dev language, it is going to have a few key benefits such as; brutally fast, blazingly brutally fast, smooth development experience with everything just working.\n* While the docker is effectively modern linux, it is on a modern linux VM, making it so much easier to maintain with modern firewalls, etc.\n* Logins using oauth.\n\nOne bit of where doing this as a rust monolith is cool, is that after 20 years of operation, I can be fairly certain of the capacity required. Rust's speed allows for an immense amount of capacity on a crap VM, 100's thousands of requests per second. With a monolith, redis type caching is just built into the application.\n\nBut, postgres is allowing for wonderful datastructures to be cooked up. One of my favourites are arrays. This makes most cases for lookup tables go away. The jsonb makes for a wonderful form of denormalization with heavily pre processed data. Combined with caching to drastically reduce db hits, and performance goes through the roof. \n\nA different application I recently built uses postgres's GIS capability. Amazing.",

My experience is that it is slower up front, but the same slow at the end. \n\nThe usual experience being it is 50% in short order, 90% not long after that, with the last 10% taking twice as long as the 90%; if it ever gets done. Obviously swamped with technical debt.\n\nWith rust projects, I find the technical debt accumulates extremely slowly, as you can depend on earlier code to the extreme.\n\nFor tiny projects where they can accumulate technical debt at almost any speed and still get finished, not so important. \n\nBut, often, I am dealing with projects where the complexity is very high, and technical debt overload is a notable risk.\n\nOne fun one I hit this morning was a particularly grinding file processing step. This was one where even in rust, it is turning the fan on my laptop on, for a single file. Maybe 40 seconds for a file in the top quartile in size.\n\nThe end user is the one uploading these files. Let's just say files per minute might be the measure of the server's performance. \n\nBut, I realized, as a rust wasm application, I can dump that load onto the user, not the server. This may have just changed the server from a 50k per month server to a $10 per month server; as the remaining work is just simple file shuffling, and using highly simplified data extracted from the file by the user.\n\nThe algos to extract the data are not proprietary, thus reverse engineering the wasm isn't a problem.\n\nWhere I find that avoiding some microservices swamp has a huge benefit is simplicity. The key is to ask if complexity is the solution to avoid other complexity. \n\nBut, as I said, one of the real benefits of having such a thing go brutally fast is that it opens up features where responsiveness was a make or break feature.\n\nBut, I've found other minor, but very important benefits to having all the functionality, or at least highly related functionality in the same program. Things like is an administrator logged in? If this is in a shared memory space with instant access, then the confidence in the security can be very high, while the code is extremely simple. Having the data moving through complex paths such as some kind of message queue becomes far cleaner. \n\nOne of the realities I've found with distributed systems is they are effectively multithreaded programming. Most programmers suck at multithreaded programming. Within a single monolith, the threading becomes more, actual threading; and thus it is easier to design an M-N threading model which is then battle hardened.\n\nI would most certainly not recommend this to most people who are not comfortable with this style development. Rust is not an easy language, teams working with compiled codebases require coordination at a level beyond where most people are prepared to go; and this is not an area most people have even toyed with, let alone have experience with.\n\nFor me, and the problems I am solving, it is perfect.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, the web facing part of my work is rarely now users. Most of my work is embedded robotics, sensors, and their interfaces. \n\nSo, for example, I recently made a device (where I used micropython as a test) where there is one user; maybe two. I still made the web interface in rust wasm. This is a toy project, not some mission critical safety critical system.\n\nIt does show this workflow is well fast enough that using my previous decades of experience where I made web stuff \"traditional\" ways was still not easier for me.",

When you are experienced enough with the language then your development speed isn’t meaningfully slower than when using other languages. People have this idea about rust because when they use it for the first time, it is much slower to write because of its differences with OOP languages. Writing it like an OOP language will cause you to constantly fight the compiler.\n\nI like using it for its high quality pattern matching syntaxes, valued enums, Option (lack of a NULL), Result (high quality error handling), and its trait system. It’s “blazing fast” speed isn’t the only selling point, and it isn’t exclusively nice to use when you have many users.",

              "text": "Yeah, it wouldn't be terribly hard to build a UDP protocol using OpenSSL with a fast symmetric cipher and a key exchange handshake. If you want to prevent randos from reading your stream that'd probably be fine. Fundamentally you can never really trust the client platform, though. Spending your time trying to build trust into a fundamentally untrustworthy platform will buy you less for your engineering effort than mitigating the possible advantages a user could derive from intercepting that stream.\n\n\nYou can generally assume that given a strong enough financial incentive, people are going to figure out a way to cheat at your game. This isn't just true of video gaming. Casinos are in a never ending arms race and need to mitigate the effects of and detect possible collusion with their staff. See also [Postlegate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stones_Gambling_Hall_cheating_scandal). That one's wild.\n\n\n So your engineering effort is usually better spent mitigating the possible advantages that having access to the streams would confer on the user. Ultima Online had that problem with the introduction of sneaking decades ago -- people would detect you from across the screen and attack you even when you were hidden. They ended up not transmitting hidden players to clients until the server decided the hidden player had been detected. The cheaters could still have faster than human reaction times, but those advantages were not hugely game breaking.\n\n\nIn online poker, even given the best anti-cheat technology in the world someone could still point a camera at a laptop and do image recognition on card faces. So if you want to build a farm of colluding bots, it's not that difficult. An online casino could try to mitigate that by randomizing who you get placed with on a table if they have a big enough pool of players. But if you have a couple dozen (say) systems running bots, you just need to have a couple of them figure out they're sitting at the same table to give yourself an advantage. And that advantage will grow the more bots you have at one table.\n\n\nA few days ago, people were talking about marking their monitor with a sharpie to give themselves an advantage at some FPS or other. Which is why I tend to be suspicious of Esports as a thing unless they're played in a controlled environment with a standardized hardware/software loadout. I suspect part of Blizzard's policy on WoW plug-ins is at least partially an attempt to normalize the environment so that in such a controlled environment a player wouldn't be facing a completely unfamiliar interface. Whenever watching any of the wow streamer channels, their UI looked *nothing* like the stock one Blizzard provided.\n\n\nKnowing all of *that* and being able to convey that information when a user asks about something vaguely related to the ssh protocol being unsuitable as a gaming protocol really highlights the weaknesses in the current round of AIs. At this point the AI has been trained in all of human knowledge, but is incapable of identifying this question as being in the category of \"cheating protection\" and suggesting good places to spend your engineering time to mitigate the impact of cheating. If you follow its advice without thinking about the problem yourself, you might end up building a program that superficially looks pretty secure but doesn't stand up to a thorough analysis by people who have an incentive to do that work. I think the way the world's going now, there will be many opportunities from cheaters because an AI didn't consider lessons learned from the past in its suggested solution. It might be possible to build an AI capable of doing that, but I be it'd be prohibitively expensive to run. Probably more prohibitively expensive than *I* am.",

An AI (likely) has no idea what specific SSH daemon package you have on your local machine, what operating system you're running, or even whether or not you compiled your SSH daemon from source, omitting or including certain additional features. \n\nThey first explain that SSH added keystroke timing obfuscation in 2023. In [the link they posted](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20230829051257) which explains this functionality, it explains exactly how it is implemented and the new ping/pong extension that it uses. Therefore, if someone were to read that post and actually glean technical meaning from it, their next question would be: Is it possible to disable ping/pong SSH extensions on [my specific version of SSH?]\"\n\nIn their case, now knowing that they're using an SSH server implemented in Go, they could have even just searched the server's source code for the extension names (SSH2_MSG_PING, SSH2_MSG_PONG).\n\nBut instead, we can see the next figure in the blog post is the user immediately reverting back to their Claude prompt, asking  the extremely broad question of: \"Is there any way to disable the chaff server-side?\"\n\nI think the lack of explanation of what version of SSH the server running, lack of clarity that they specifically want to disable the new ping/pong extension, and the generic way they referred to the functionality as \"chaff\" demonstrated that despite AI and/or their research leading them directly to the answer, they failed to parse the technical information they were already provided and instead decided to rely on their AI agent to do the job for them and walk them through it.\n\nI was even more taken aback when I saw their screenshot mentioning \"Claude was also pretty pumped\" about their results, with the most obvious \"AI gassing you up and being your yes-man\" response of all time in the screenshot.\n\nI think the overall flow of their problem solving skills demonstrated in the blog post show an over reliance on AI and a lack of critical thinking skills applied to the project.",

By doing so, the author is denying themselves a valuable learning opportunity to try out and familiarize themselves with common networking and analysis tools (tcpdump, wireshark) that they'll likely use for the rest of their career.\n\n(Caveat: It's possible this is a personal skill issue on my part! I'm not denying that someone could write an insane tcpdump one liner to do network analysis - I just don't personally think someone with the skillset to do would ever choose to waste time on scripting that instead of just viewing raw dumped output/using wireshark - but that is also my bias. It's possible that kind of engineer exists!)",

From there you can engage critical thinking skills and read the documentation to understand how the tool works. I think it's somewhat silly to imply that Google has poor results when looking up technical documentation or information, as it's usually the shortest path to reach the writings of the actual implementers or designers of the thing you're investigating (ie: finding and reading sshd manpages, source code, etc. can all be done easily with Google, regardless of the search engine serving ads or whatever else)\n\nHaving an LLM parse similar manpages for me and try to regurgitate information from it, while obfuscating things like the sshd version, the source of the data, the legitimacy of the data source, etc. just feels like a waste of time. And if I ask an LLM to specify all of that information, I'm essentially just using a search engine again but with more steps.\n\nAI can be useful for providing guidance on generic problems, but it's important to stick to factual documentation and sources of information when dealing with complex technical issues or implementations like SSH. Documentation differs between versions, packages, operating systems, libraries, etc.\n\nAlso, on your point about Google being designed \"to make money for Google\":\n\nGoogle attempts to make a useful product, because if it isn't a useful search engine then users will stop using it. And if there are no users, there will be no one left to look at their ads. In the same way, Claude/ChatGPT/etc. currently attempt to be useful, but just like a Google search, are inherently profit-driven, selling user training data and other analytics. While Google Ads may not be the same profit motivator as captured analytics and training data, both companies make an attempt to be as useful as possible to protect their income stream and user base.",

There are still some cool utilities and shortcuts in there though. Animations and effects maybe? I'd love to hear from someone knowledgeable who can elaborate futher.\n\nShort answer: I'm guessing probably habit and convention more than anything. It's still bundled with Wordpress and all the tutorials use it. The frontend de jour isn't as big of a deal in the real world. And in today's age, a 80kb library is actually pretty fucking adorable.\n\nHTMX is 60kb. What can you do with it that you can't with VJS? Nuthin. It's just fun",

The benefit of the d3 way seems to just be if you want to do d3 transitions, which do are still more fully featured than most things you might replace them with.\n\nAll that said, I used to be making more flashy and ambitious visualizations with d3, with my current role being more conservative and having me mostly focus on the data going into them.

We plan to remove support in stages, and the next step will be released in jQuery 5.0.\n\nThey're actually planning to release more major versions, too. Makes sense to drop support for older browsers, but it also kinda feel like that might be a good reason to want to use jQuery, to support complex scripting in retro browsers, as niche as that use case may be.\n\nAnyway, I don't think there's really a good argument for using jQuery for new projects these days. Plain JS does everything you want and it's more or less just as convenient. I do believe that DOM manipulation can still be somewhat complicated and verbose in plain JS, though, and jQuery has a nice set of helper functions for it that are pretty powerful. It's not really worth using it just for that, but this is an area where plain JS has always been a little bit unnecessarily awkward.",

If you can properly communicate and educate you can usually avoid working on “stupid” things and elevate yourself in the process. \n\nIf you learn how to do this in a friendly and collaborative way instead of an adversarial one, you’re more likely to reduce “stupidity” instead of just deflecting it.

When they see you're earnest, they're more likely to be earnest in return. And when you're friendly, they're more likely to be friendly. And all that adds up to people extending benefit of the doubt, being predisposed to listen to you, etc.\n\nIn this case, people are much more likely to gracefully take pushback and change tack to work together with you if they think you're a decent guy who's on the level and not out to fuck them. And even more so if you had a beer together recently. \n\nAnd the reverse is true too, when you've had a beer with them recently, they don't come to you with a \"stupid idea,\" they come to you with \"a reasonable suggestion that needs some workshopping\" to, depending on your political writing, get everyone all pulling in the same direction, or just to make sense given your relevant roles and goals and system architectures and whatnot.\n\nLike you said. Politics. \n\nWe can't do everything solo. We need buy-in. How you get that buy-in is Politics. Some people are convinced on purely technical arguments ... but it may not be obvious which arguments they value. Some people are convinced based on simply whether they like you ... so fucking bribe them with a beer once in a while, and smile and nod a lot. Some people are convinced only if it furthers their career or other goals. Some people are convinced only if it seems like their own idea in the first place. Some people don't give a shit and do whatever their boss says. You want to get a lot done, done well, and done in the furtherance of your goals? Figure out who's who.",

Until you understand the dynamics and politics it's easy to do a faux pas that eats at your credibility early, and it's a PITA to push on your projects if you start with burnt bridges you have to amend.\n* I seriously advice against criticizing a project without offering a better alternative. Hell many times if you can identify the key fix that the project will need and you have the cycles, you can start that and when the project hits the issue, you can come in as the hero with the missing piece. If you don't have an idea of how to fix it yourself, or don't have anything to add then honestly let it go.\n* It also should be considered that many successful projects started as really bad projects that then pivoted as they fixed the core issues and it resulted in something radically different. One thing I've learned as a senior is that sometimes you have to let people do it the wrong way so they can find the right way. This is doubly so when you yourself don't know what the right way is going to be.\n* On the Killing a VP project, $50,000 political credibility cost, I'd up the number to $100,000, it's something you don't want to do, and that many people will never do in their lives. I think that projects on that size are messy, and a lot of times you have a lot of leeway in how you interact with things (make it easy to undo or change back) you can negotiate on that space and it's smaller, and even then there's are many ways to do it without saying the project is a bad idea outright, just having issues on your side. The only reason I think this should be used is if it becomes an existential issue: one that would kill *your* project or the entire company. Basically you use this when getting fired is not the worst case scenario because the alternative was very probably going to be you being without a job.\n    * And this one you certainly need to have a better path/alternative that can be done instead, because you'll have to propose something that the company can do.",

Realize what is the implication there. This is talking about projects like that. What I propose is that at that level, it's best to do damage control on your side, and let the project try on its own.

Each fab is at least a billion dollars in upfront costs. If the demand for GPU/RAM crashes in the year it takes to get built, it's a net loss for the company. The current capacity is just enough to supply the business market by sacrificing the consumer market, and us consumers will either:\n\n- wait it out\n\n- buy anyways\n\nEither way, it's a win for the manufacturer which will raise prices that will take years to go back down. The only reason the prices would drop sharply would be to have an oversupply, which can't happen because fabs are not getting built.",

That’s good enough in my book, but I can imagine that problem (among many other reasons) preventing you from adopting smolid.\n\nNope, I like it.\n\nThe endless argument over UUIDs is that there's competing constraints. If you want a UUID that is *forever* unique and meaningful and part of an audit trace, over ANY circumstance - massively distributed, surviving company acquisition, refactoring, decades of bit rot, dumped into logs and schemaless backups, passed between data processors and back, then encode the whole lot.\n\nThe UUID is self-contained within a single application? Sure, scale the timestamp over the period between the date of the first git commit to the age you expect to be long dead, and you've saved some CO_2 emissions.\n\n> I’ll just leave that to the PostgreSQL project or ISO/IEC to fix before 2059.\n\nSensible conclusion in most circumstances! As long as you aren't designing infrastructure, my own \"rule of thumb\" is 25 years, so by that metric this isn't a bad decision for another eight years.\n\n> Only 2 bits for versioning?\n\nAbsolutely enough. Possibly too many. The only valid answers are between zero and two, and 'one' is on thin ice.\n\n> smolid is useful where your peaks are around a thousand new records per second. If this sounds like you, feel free to play with it!\n\nYup! Any faster, stick a queue in front of it. UUIDs aren't going to be the bottleneck.",

The intent was to give reviewers/maintainers a way to shut down slop PRs quickly and push the burden back on the author to prove the PR is worth reviewing. There is a whole discussion about extractive contributions that may be worth reading to understand the spirit. It still takes time, but we are not at the breaking point where we need further restriction.\n\n\nWe also don't want to wholesale ban LLM-assisted contributions as many active established contributors are pretty happily using these tools. There is a precedent of an optimization discovered by Claude and validated through Alive that was accepted, for example. This is also how we all learn to work with these tools effectively. I expect maintainers and experienced contributors to mentor new contributors on the best practices of LLM usage the same way they would mentor them on using cmake, tablegen or even git. So I don't see a particular risk of there not being a new generation of maintainers: some people will volunteer to put in time and effort regardless of the tooling landscape and some will just send a one-off PR to put \"LLVM contributor\" on their CV.\n\n\nUltimately, we are sort of playing the Turing's imitation game at scale: if a bunch of expert reviewers can't tell the difference, does it matter that a PR is machine-assisted or even generated?\n\n\nDisclaimer: opinions are personal and don't engage any instance of the LLVM project I may be a part of.",

TL;DR: I quantize the components of the sampling (shape) vector to one of 8 possible values and use those to construct a cache key. I then use that to create a lookup table around 2MB in size, which makes lookups very, very cheap.\n\nBut yeah, a lot of effort went into making this run smoothly on mobile. The other primary performance concern is collecting the sampling vectors themselves and performing contrast enhancement, both of which I needed to delegate to the GPU. On my (admittedly powerful) laptop, the full pipeline for rendering a frame takes around 2ms. The [appendix on GPU acceleration](https://alexharri.com/blog/ascii-rendering#appendix-gpu-acceleration) briefly covers this.\n\nBut no plans to implement color for now.

I also think that we are just at the start of leveraging theorem provers in general and using them to prove the correctness of some implementation against a formal specification specifically.\n\nThere is a lack of knowledge on how to effectiviely work with formal specifications. Perhaps it is possible to build tools to help with producing and evaluating formal specifications. Perhaps we could move towards reducing incidental complexity from our systems in a way that would make it possible for mathematical reasoning to scale better.\n\nMy main point is that theorem provers could eliminate the core flaw of llms to be unreliable and hallucinate and that both technologies are only at the start of their development.",

Which as an IC are basically out of your control. I chased those things as a way to survive the upcoming layoffs, and when I was laid off anyway (along with almost all of my org) it hit me hard. I took that to the next job, and when I came across a bad manager who belittled my contributions while I was trying hard to get influence and impact it broke me. I got laid off again.\n\nNow after some reflections I realise that layoffs happen no matter how hard you try. Attempting to impress people and chase influence and impact is not a worthy goal. Just do the best you can and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nI think the most dangerous thing about performance reviews is that it makes you feel like your compensation and levelling is down to your work quality. As you mentioned in the article, it is more down to politics.",

After all, if you shout loud enough at the right people, you can get compensation approved. \n\nI was watching a video the other day, where they talked about how Sales people are compensated. Where you directly tie bonus into the sales you bring in. The nice thing about this is that increasing someone else's bonus wouldn't be reduced by another person's bonus. I wonder if the ideal system would be to somehow justify the value of an engineer's work in terms of money made, and reward based on that.

Some are just more open to spending than others. And as soon as a salesperson leaves there is a huge political mess about what to do with their accounts. You might be doing well - you just signed a 500k uplift with a customer and are well on track to hit your number for the year. Then Mike leaves the company and you get one of his accounts. On paper they look good - 2 million ARR, but they emailed Mike before he left that they were planning to spend 1 million less this year, and Mike never updated his Salesforce notes to reflect this. You get the account and it’s less than 2 months before the renewal. Suddenly you’re 500k in the hole through no fault of your own.",

We have X to distribute in bonuses, Y in raises, and we have A B C D promotions available for the various levels. \n\nStarting at the top of the org chart pyramid and flowing to the bottom, each manager has to decide how to split this pool. Who gets more and who gets less. \n\nCovid times was weird as hell because for a couple years there the budgets really ballooned, especially at a lot of the top tier companies. Then suddenly, cutbacks. Layoffs if you were unlucky. So now managers have to tell employees, you did an amazing job this year, best I can do for you is a shit raise, because the company is tightening its belt. Some people take this in stride, some people quit for more pay elsewhere or politely threaten to do so, some people take this really personally. \n\nIt's also one of the reasons that a team of equal level people can bite you - you have four up from promo but your team gets at most two. What to do? If they're all junior, they need promotions soon else it's an obvious sign to quit; if they're senior they expect longer times between promos and are generally less likely to quit but if they do the impact is more severe. \n\nA company doesn't need to stack rank for comparisons between employees and limited resources afforded by the beancounters and execs to be somewhat painful. \n\nIn ye olde mythical times you could just trust the company management understands all this and will take care of you. Unsure exactly how much that was real vs rosy tinted glasses. Today people get really antsy immediately for good reasons, a missed promo could be a sign of an impending pip/layoff/fire.",

          "text": "> compensation teams, HR partners, even senior leaders — genuinely want them to be fair, data-driven, and humane within the budget limits set by company leadership.\n\nHere's the problem, *exactly*: people's economic impact cannot be confined into the budgetary limits imposed by leadership.  You'll find that in the whole of your experience, never once did you witness compensation or promotional criteria actually try to arrive at a very simple truth: what is the current and future financial impact of this person's work.  You'll find that this is severely downplayed even when the financial impact is clear and undeniable.  At large tech companies, it's almost commonplace for people to fix bugs or implement performance optimizations that recover *millions* in lost revenue.  \n\nThe whole performance review process exists *solely* to stop people from talking about money.  Or the most obvious fact about money: that the total compensation is always less than the total benefit.  The compensation budget gets set *in advance*, before the performance review cycle even begins.  It's all a distraction to get workers to squabble over the scraps that had been thrown their way.  It does not and cannot reflect reality.\n\n> Companies are still fundamentally hierarchical. We haven’t found a better way to run them — or at least, we haven’t seriously tried. \n\nOn the contrary!  If we just *stopped trying*, for once, things would instantly get better.  There is a large body of scientific and business literature and studies that consistently show the same thing: performance reviews are harmful.  Just stop doing them!  \n\nThe anecdote from your time in Moscow is a case in point: there was no process, but when they discovered someone had been underpaid for 2 years, they gave her backpay.  See?  Already, that's better.  \n\nI'm old enough to have worked at tech companies *before* they started performance review cycles.  It was glorious.  If you wanted a promotion or a raise, you would walk into your manager's office and demand one.  Money was discussed *openly*, with client contracts and sales figures being transparently available to everyone who was working on them.  The way you had \"impact\" was by making sure you worked on the projects with the largest upside while spending the least amount of time on the ones that were underwater.  Very simple.  When negotiating, everything was on the table - salary, vacation days, choice of projects, even all-expense paid trips for your family to join you on business trips.  One year I flew out to Colorado to manage one of their engineering teams for the summer and in exchange I got to live in a mountain cabin with my girlfriend on the company dime - all expenses paid. \n\nThere was only one time when I found that performance reviews were useful: when I didn't have to participate.  I just walked into my manager's office one day and he said, \"good news, you're getting a promotion and a pay raise\".  And even then, that was the *only* good part about it.  As soon as I got to the point where I wanted the next promotion and pay increase that I thought I was due, then suddenly all the bullshit started to matter.  So I had no choice but to quit and get what I wanted from somewhere else.\n\nBut it's been downhill from there. *It is* a wage suppression scheme.",

Emails that announce your work launching, design documents/reviews, who talks about it are all very important. Two projects that save same amount of money/equal engagement gains will often have very different perceived impact based on how they are communicated. A big part of this is also just focusing your work to align with your manager/skip manager/even higher up as possible.\n\n2. Relationships with people above you: The higher the better. My current company even requires your promotion performance reviews come from people at your target level or higher. You want to promote for senior? Then ideally have multiple staff/senior staff/etc engineers and managers that support you. Having only senior reviewers is technically enough but your chances improve heavily the higher level your support comes from.\n\n\n\nFor 2 one thing I did early on as a junior engineer was \\~2 times a month schedule a casual 1 on 1 with people from teams/departments mine collaborated with to learn more about their work. While that was not done for the purpose of promotion, in retrospect forming a lot of good relationships with senior/staff engineers as a junior helped heavily. I still sometimes do it now (much less though) and now I do consider what level someone is. Just having people high up being aware of your work and include you in future discussions is very helpful.\n\n  \nPart of number 2 is also just the image you end up building.

          "text": "I mean it's a challenging notion. The first problem, I'd argue, is that there's no objective or reasonable way to measure individual performance. Because so much of the performance of an individual is respective to transient situations and the team you're in.\n\nSay we have a new staff engineer, they've got chops and history, but the company is in a dire position and they are struggling. If they go to team A they'll be thrown some starter projects but have those changed around. Mostly due to the massive reorgs the company is going due to the dire position. Then they'll be thrown around to different teams that work on disparate situations and struggle with different parts of the infrastructure. Our engineer now has worked on radically different platforms, but has never really spent more than 6 months on any team. After 2 years the engineer has done solid job, but more on a senior, not staff level, so they do badly on reviews. The engineer also now struggles to catch up and get something in.\n\nSay we had the same staff engineer, but this time joined a team B where there was a principal engineer involved. As chaos from the reorg happens, the principal takes the new eng under his wing and with a director, they want to create a \"strike\" team that will focus ~40-60% of their time to a specific goal that is important for the company, even as the reorg happens (this is why the strike team, it's meant to be decoupled from the reorg and therefore have a consistent approach. You are not the strongest engineer the principal could take, but the principal engineer sees that the new eng has the potential they just haven't had the opportunity to gain expertise in an area, and they believe that the staff can totally take over this project once things settle down, and the other engineers, though their expertise with the company and its systems can ramp up more quickly, they also would benefit the teams during the reorg more. So this staff engineer now spends ~9 months on this project, and naturally becomes the lead (he's switched to other projects, but they mostly help with the firefighting, paying down the tech debt from the reorg, and then are moved on to another team). After the whole thing the engineer now has grown confidence in his area and helps create a new team for the project that the strike force handled, and is made the tech lead of this team, as the principal has moved on to other projects. Now during after 2 years they have helped a multitude of teams and gained a lot of networking and wide knowledge, but also have pushed and lead critical systems in the company: exactly what you'd expect of a very solid to strong staff engineer.\n\nThe same engineer, the same company, but the difference was just one person that understood how to get their potential out, and not let circumstances hamper the productivity of that engineer. It can be many other variations: access to a mentor or someone who is willing to sit and teach, a manager who understands how to excite you (or at the very least knows how to express feedback and weakness in an actionable manner), a tech lead that has a similar philosophy on software and things with the team just \"click\", or a mix of all of this, or maybe a team that has just the right mix of meetings to avoid thrashing but keep the eng focused through their ADHD. A good chunk of the effective productivity of an engineer is affected by the people around them. This is why we pay manager and middle management so well, this is why staff+ engineers are all about how they work with others: jobs whose effect is increasing the impact/productivity of ICs are huge benefits.\n\nSo we can measure the productivity at team level relatively well, but it's hard to do it at individual level. Any system that purports to be able to measure this directly on the individual is bound to have parts of it that are arbitrarily defined and hand-waved away based on what is convenient. This gives us different pros and cons. In some companies you lose a lot of amazing engineers because they move elsewhere once they are good enough, because you can't recognize them. In some companies you'd have to lose tens of solid engineers while a team struggles for years before realizing it was a management issue. In some companies there's a lot of people who just have no idea what to do and require an insane unjustifiable investment to become productive enough but you can't justify getting rid of them either.",

              "text": "So how do we track individuals? The answer is complicated, but there is a way. Ironically the easier problem to solve is, IMHO, promotions:\n\n* New grad to Junior: just meet expectations for a couple of years, if you are still in New Grad level and are more than X years after you graduated, this should be a moment to bring up an intervention with possible firing. There's a chance that the training and education you need just can't be given at the company, and extending your time stuck in that fresh-outta-school mentality is going to be far more harmful to your range. A successful intervention should basically finish in the guy getting a promotion to junior. A recommendation to go into other spaces (consulting can be brutal but it's great at teaching and forming solid programmers).\n* Junior to Mid: it's about a checklist of skills. Basically you need to have done X amount of projects, covered X amount of things, used X amount of technologies. Basically you need to do what a solid engineer can do and understand a variety of things beyond \"just coding\". You need to be able to get peers to review you positively (like asking for a recommendation, or a peer review) on those projects and about those skills.\n* Mid to Senior: the full checklist, with some advanced work (e.g. supported software that was long-lived, has worked with legacy code, etc.) that's important for the knowledge. At this point you are considered a strong engineer who can do anything that's expected of an engineer and do it well. You also show you know how to work well on a team and understand how to mentor, lead technical design, etc. As in many tech companies (though that may be changing thanks to AI) this is the level you are expected to eventually get to. If you are unable to get a promotion above this it shouldn't be held above you: projects in the staff+ land are rarer, and proving your performance beyond this level is messy.\n* Senior to Staff: This is where we start actually looking at performance. The goal is to show you can interact in variety of projects, with a variety of teams, and yet in all these environments you show a consistent impact. That is you can notice that teams you join have an increase in productivity and impact consistently, and projects you lead tend to be core part of that. If the effect remains after you leave this may actually be a stronger signal of you being staff level. Basically show this in enough environments that you have to start to consider that it'd be a statistical anomaly that it wasn't something unique to you specifically. With this you prove you have a multiplicative effect, and are a highly useful and powerful engineer to pass around teams, and to start thinking on the level beyond teams.\n* Going to Staff+ positions is just about staff but with even more.. Not just show you work well in different teams, but different problem spaces, different areas of the company, different software, and about how well your leadership and mesh with leadership is. This becomes more like the promotions of VPs and onwards, a more political and subtle thing.\n\nThat's great. So what about performance? First of all lets understand the problem with stack-ranking, and in many companies calibration is really stack-ranking behind the scenes. The idea is that employees over a large enough group should distribute normally, and by having the managers discuss over all of these employees they can rank the employees accordingly. If you really wanted an objective measurable way, you would use perf-packets reviewed by a performance committee of managers who were unrelated to the employees being reviewed. Your manager would be on a pref-committee for other engineers. The perf-packet would be made by the employee and manager and make the arguments and data for it. Like the inputs you give to the Roblox algorithm, but it's a committee of humans, and you can appeal a review with another committee.\n\nBut either way this doesn't solve shit either, because of the core problem the article put forward: there's limited budgets to distribute. And how do you distribute them. While we know that stack ranking doesn't work, no one every discussed why. The answer is simple: we assume a normal curve, but who the hell said that's the case? It could just as well be an exponential curve (it is intuitive that the time an engineer has been at the company follows an exponential distribution, it is also intuitive that amount of time an engineer needs to get to a skill level is also an exponential distribution, does this mean that performance is non-normal? No it might be normal, but the point is to make a reasonable case that maybe it isn't). The second issue is what I've said: we track teams, not members.\n\nSo instead lets measure the performance of teams first. We can do a nice, objective system, where a report of what was done is made, and it's measured by managers unrelated to the team into some value. Now we rank the teams in simple terms: it's meeting the expectation, surpassing them, or failing to reach them. We can compare areas of the companies as well by using a Mann-Whitney U-Test to compare how different products compare in efficiency. This is just an interesting number to see how it compares to the profits of that product, but sometimes your cash-cow isn't what needs the most money (it's resilient and working well) and instead the focus should be on the bleeding edge where you're finding new growth opportunities. This info can be used to measure.",

                  "text": "Now what about bad performance? Well lets start with the individual: when an engineer is working badly within a team, or not satisfying them, they are transferred to a new team, with no information about why they looked for an internal transfer shared with the team (that said they may need to pass the internal interview and all that, and if they fail they lose the job). This isn't spreading bad employees around, it's acknowledging that context and situation may matter. If you fail consistently and have other people not wanting to work with you, then an intervention is set up, with a high chance that it'll result in you losing the job. This might seem expensive, but given how long a mediocre employee can remain in the job, it honestly isn't, and teams have an easier time just asking to trade someone for another person, rather than having to set up the firing. The firing happens at a higher level than your direct EM, it requires that multiple EMs are unhappy with you on their different teams, throughout different moments of the employee's life (so it wasn't just a couple bad days, but months).\n\nWith teams with bad performance a similar thing is done. An intervention is done to understand what is happening with the team. There's an order of magnitude less teams than employees (almost by tautological definition) so more effort can be put at scrutinizing the performance. If the issue seems transient, the team is given a second chance to recover. If the issue seems that the team is oversized or under-sized for the projects it handles (i.e. the team's actually able to do everything it wants super quickly, but there simply isn't that much to do as the product has reached a certain level of maturity where the focus is to keep things stable and do incremental improvements there just aren't that many goals to achieve, or alternatively the team struggles to do most of its goals because it's overwhelmed with work) the headcount is reassessed. If the team seems to have engineering issues, weak engineers are transferred to other teams (as per the bad individual performance test above) and you bring in a staff+ engineer to see if they can help change the team to something better. If the problem seems to be mismanagement, then you handle the EM as you would with a bad individual performance issue above. Of course there may be bigger issues at director level and what not, but these are easy to measure, we can rank multi-team leads by doing U-Test between their teams, without the issues of the above. That said, even there you probably want to run some experiments: strong directors may take on more teams/products, while weaker directors may cede some of their teams, until we reach a level. Ideally directors will need to be able to increase the number of teams to advance up the ladder, as they need to show they have a consistently positive benefit over a large enough group of people.\n\nSo what about strong individuals? They'll get their projects and what not that help them get the promotions and to staff quickly enough. Having a patron would also help getting these projects, that hasn't changed.\n\nAnd I agree with the author here: the goal shouldn't be fairness. It should be humanity + alignment. Alignment is the goal for the company: the whole point is that employees give them the most value for their salary, and the benefit to the employee is that they realize what work they do not need to do and can focus on what will actually get them paid more. Humanity is the necessary part for the process to work with the employees. The answer is to be predictable, transparent and candid on the whole thing. Let employees be able to see a calibration/rating meeting, have things be transparent, and be honest about the strengths and weaknesses. Admit that the goal isn't to be a perfect meritocracy, but to reward employees who do the best they can for the company. Be candid in your feedback on how to improve, and be candid on how to 'cheat' the system (e.g. the easiest way to get a great score is to show you generated $X amount of profit for the company that year, where $X is notably larger than what you cost the company) because it isn't cheating the system: it's aligning with the company values (now those may have their own issue, but that's a separate problem). And be clear that there's limited budgets and they're being distributed among all the employees. Maybe a year the profits are 3x and the budget 2x, but the number of employees is now 5x, let the engineers do the math. Treat your employees as adults and trust that they are big boys who understand that this is a business and a job, not a hobby club. And do this making it clear to the employee that you expect the employees to work for their own best interest within the system, and that you want them to succeed because that means they made you, the employer, succeed as well.\n\nThen listen to the feedback: why do employees not like the system. Why do they find it broken? When does it not reward them for doing what the company wants them to do? When does it punish them for it? What are the issues that employees are having? While the system I have may seem extreme, the idea is that you only need peer reviews while building towards senior promotions, but not for normal perf.\n\nAnd this isn't perfect. Lotta details missing on how to not make this take 40% of your eng-hrs and manager-hrs every year. How to make it easy to understand, etc.",

Two cases come to my mind:\n\n1. Early job.  My boss came out of a nasty 4 hour support call, but still needed to give me a year-end review before I went on vacation.  He was not in a good mood.  He spent the next two hours going beyond every detail to nitpick things from my first couple of weeks.  He started complaining about my lunch choices.  He even believed some (obvious) lies from his favorite self-appointed-second-in-command, which was the only time I raised my voice back at him.  I still have some lasting trauma from the place.  Years later I’ve learned about narcissistic abuse only to come to the conclusion that this man was an A+ P.o.S.\n2. Not so early job.  I was working for an unstable company that had three CEOs in the span of 12 months.  Product was not built properly from the start (before my time), but we were making headway.  Halfway through my (good) boss ran off to China and was replaced with a “Rockstar” programmer.  Biggest P.o.S. I ever worked for (like AAA+).  Issues included constantly complaining and belittling others behind their back, constantly yelling/asking me “Why did <person> do this?” When there were things done way before my time.  I also suspect he was having a failing marriage because he was constantly telling me about his wife hates him.  As for my performance review, he used it more as a session to complain about things at the company, and even admitted that he couldn’t accurately rate me but still wanted to give me poor marks.  I did try to confront him about this, but when I spoke up an told him that his review was “not fair an accurate” the first thing he shouted to me was “is this about the bonus”?  When we got the product done (and ready for regulator approval) most of us in product development were laid off, except for him.  I believe management wanted to keep him on to clean software things up.  I later found out that he rage quit the company a few weeks later.  But what’s interesting is that he lists himself as working at the company for 5 months longer than his quit date (didn’t want to make it look like he was only there for 7 months).  Somehow he was able to be “Director of Software Engineering” at two companies, at the same time (I think he was lying).\n\n---\n\nI never said anything at the time because I was afraid of losing my job and that these companies were small and didn’t have an HR department.  Don’t stand for abuse and call it out.  I wish I had a time machine to go back and convince my former self to call these people abusive to their faces in the moment.",

It can lead to the wrong conclusion: “avoid boundaries, have one team do everything.” That just hides the problem until the system gets too big to hold in one person’s head.\n\nWhat works is being explicit at the boundary: agree on shared terminology (and avoid loaded jargon), surface assumptions, and write down the minimal invariants the integration depends on (units, power source, interface expectations, tolerances, etc.). Working from invariants makes “boring” failures like unit mismatches much harder to miss, because you stop reasoning about what the other engineer surely knows and start reasoning about what must be true for the integration not to fail. That’s why “failure to communicate” is usually “failure to predict edge cases”, especially the stupid, mundane ones we assume would never happen (like pounds vs newtons mismatch).\n\nStarting from invariants moves you from “we missed obvious edge cases” to the much more respectable problem of “we weren’t perfect at predicting genuinely intricate edge cases.”",

There are libraries to provide this sort of functionality, but they're not standard, and they're not ubiquitous and used by every engineer.\n\nIf I'm looking at some metric and I see a field called `latency` of type `double` -- what unit is it? Depending on the system, I have seen seconds, milliseconds, and nanoseconds. Sure, you could call it `latency_ms` -- but why not just have `latency` be of type `duration`?\n\nWhen dealing with currency transactions, you'll usually see one of two things. It's some language-specific form of decimal, or it's an integer value of the smallest denomination. So either $5 == €5 == ¥5 == ₩5 (which is very wrong) or US¢500 == EU¢500 == ¥500 == ₩500 (which is a lot closer but still very wrong). Why not have a first-class currency datatype that allows you to know that $5.00 > $3.00 but will error out if you try to check $5.00 > ¥300 unless you explicitly convert with an exchange rate?\n\nFor that matter, the type system could even deny you the ability to divide a currency value by a scalar, a huge potential source of bugs, and instead offer multiple methods depending on the context. Like splitting an amount into shares, honoring things like rounding rules and minimum coin sizes, so that the results are guaranteed to add up to the original amount and no Superman 3/Office Space chicanery can happen.\n\nAnd the very existence of a first-class currency type in the standard library would discourage inexperienced developers from trying to use floating-point values for currency.",

You want to tell me that it was simple and unmistakable the judge would have accepted it as an honest mistake, but the fact it's so obfuscated only serves to weaken the argument that it was a mistake?",

Citi sent the money, and the recipients took the position that they weren't under any particular obligation to send it back... it was Citi's business whether or not they could collect from the creditors.",

But more importantly, the question of whether it did or didn't have to be returned did not at all rest on whether the transfer would have looked correct to Citi, but whether it should have looked correct to *Revlon.* Which obviously had nothing to do with Citi's UI.\n\nThough that said, that UI also violated many well-established rules of good ux design and is thus not particularly a case of a system functioning correctly to begin with. That accident had a clear cause and responsible actors- those who designed the UI, those who signed off on it, and those who continually failed to replace it.",
