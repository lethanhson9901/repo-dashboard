When everyone could suddenly publish content, platforms had to build reputation graphs — upvotes, trust scores, visibility based on track record. I think open source is going to need something similar. Some kind of contributor reputation system where your history of merged, quality PRs actually affects how your submissions get prioritized for review.\n\nIt won't fully solve it, but the content world has dealt with the \"flood of low-quality submissions\" problem before, and there are learnings we can borrow.",

Playing it out in my mind, it could be that an AI submits enough accepted requests to get past the startup limit, but in order to do that, it would have to not submit slop. And if that's the case, then it's not AI slop anymore. Unless you have many AI accounts and are just depending on luck to get one through, but then what's the motivation? Have an AI get itself into a position where it can submit slop? That doesn't make sense. Unless it's to actively get into as position where they can submit less suspicious vulnerabilities. But then you don't need trust as much as you need to get it past scrutiny, which I would think is roughly the same probability either way.",

I have over a decade of experience as a software engineer and know how important it is to have cohesive, well-implemented, and tested PRs with code and functionality that complements the existing codebase.

The open source contribution model was built on the assumption that submitting a PR requires enough effort that most spam self-selects out. Now the effort floor is basically zero so every kid with a Claude subscription can shotgun PRs at popular repos hoping something sticks on their GitHub profile.  \n  \n  \nWhat's wild is that the AI slop is often technically correct enough to pass a quick glance but architecturally wrong in ways that take a senior maintainer 20 minutes to explain in a review comment. That's the real cost — not the bad PRs that get rejected in 30 seconds, but the ones that look plausible and waste reviewer time. It's a denial of service attack on maintainer attention and I don't think CLA bots or contributor agreements will fix it.  \n  \n  \nThe web of trust idea sounds nice until you realize it basically recreates the old boys club problem that open source was supposed to fix. I don't know what the answer is. Maybe contribution tiers where new contributors start with docs-only access? Ugly but might be necessary.",

Now we'd need some form of barrier before allowing people to post to the mailing list, I hope this will usher in something like a \"dev certification\" where you have to sit some in-person exam and if you pass, you get a private key. And then contributions will need to be signed with those keys otherwise the server won't even let you submit them. If course some \"cert mills\" could emerge but their key issuing authority could just be revoked.. The industry needed something like this for so long tbh",

This means that an AI that can reliably detect whether a given fragment is AI slop or not will also be capable of producing AI slop that will pass its own test.\n\nIn other words, training an AI to detect AI output will also train it to produce output that it cannot detect as being AI output.\n\nThe best you can get is probably a model that can detect output from other, weaker, models. But once you roll out such a model, due to the way the competition in that landscape works, people will quickly move to models that can pass that test.\n\nMeanwhile, the false positive rate will go up, and legit human contributions will be rejected for being incorrectly flagged as \"AI slop\".\n\nEither way, humanity loses.\n\nThe best solution we have, unfortunately, is to check for quality issues without worrying too much about whether the author is human or not - if it doesn't fit the coding style, if it doesn't pass the tests, if it doesn't meet the project's readability standards, if the documentation is wrong, if the code doesn't do something that would actually be a useful addition, reject it; and if the contributor isn't capable of being civil and respectful about it and keeps hammering you with low-quality PRs, block (and, in severe cases, report) them.\n\nThis takes a lot of work, but fortunately, at least some of those things can be automated, often without resorting to AI tools. Automated tests exist, coverage checkers exist, linters exist, and integrating them with PR tooling isn't that difficult.",

We can’t keep on relying on GitHub actions for everything.\n\nOne option could be that you cannot open a PR unless you have an issue assigned to you. This isn’t foolproof. Someone could create an issue and assign it to themself. To prevent people from creating PRs that are unrelated to the issues, we can use AI to analyse whether a PR is related to an issue or not. A workflow could be:\nOpen issue > maintainer validates it and assigns it > assignee opens a PR with issue number in title or description > AI analyses the PR and verifies that it foxes the issue that was assigned to them — if no, then the PR is auto closed and locked.\n\nOne of the other comments mentioned vouch, which sounds like a very good idea and we can take it a step further — some sort of global whitelist / blacklist which is used by all popular open source repositories. We can add restrictions based on account age, number of PRs created (if it’s their first PR in a large size repo or they never have a PR merged before, then it’s most likely slop), number of genuine contributions (participation in issues and discussions), etc.\n\nOr, the another option could be to have some sort of system that grants them temporary OTPs which they add to the PR title or description without which the PR will be auto closed. We can leave it to maintainers how they want to distribute these OTPs — Slack/Discord communities, email, etc\n\nSince Github isn’t helping collaborators as proactively as it should, the step most projects are taking is to block public PRs and restrict it to maintainer only. This works very well, but it makes it very difficult for newcomers to contribute in this case.",

The core problem is asymmetry, generating a plausible looking PR now takes 30 seconds but reviewing one still takes 20+ minutes from a senior maintainer.

              "text": "One of the things that finally struck me at my longest job, that I should have seen earlier, was the evolution of perception that leads people to say something happens “all the time”.\n\nWe make the category error of measuring mistakes as ratios or percentage points but the people who are affected by them think only about frequency, and they form their grievances based on statistical clustering about that frequency. \n\nWhich means if a problem happened twice in one week but usually happens on average once a month, it can now be complained about as an “all the time” issue.\n\nIf you make a process or tool more popular, it fails more often, both in frequency and percentage. Frequency should need no explanation at this point. The tool didn’t magically become less error prone. \n\nBut popularity brings in new participants, and encourages existing ones to use it when they are in less amenable headspace - if something’s hard you put it off until you’re having a good day for deep work, and then you do it. But with more confidence comes more bravado, and more chances for human error. \n\nI have a rule of 2 for these sort of initiatives. If you intend to double the usage of a process, you first need to attempt to make it four times as reliable. That way even if it’s used twice as much, you’ll still have a lower frequency of errors. If you didn’t quite hit the4x target, you’ll still settle in somewhere around 2-3 times the usage. If you did manage 4+, then you’re more likely to get around 3x. \n\nWe had a CD process that ran at a tempo. And a hotfix process that was brittle af, but occasionally got used as a poor man’s canary build to test out major architectural changes and tech debt removal. It was only getting used that way about twice per quarter and the tech debt was getting so bad that people were leaving. \n\nI automated all the bookkeeping parts and also shrunk the run book a bunch, often while working on other stuff (like tech debt removal). Eventually we went from using it twice a quarter to twice a week. Which was gratifying but the part I didn’t anticipate is that it got people off the fence on tech debt. All those extra uses were in service of testing riskier changes, often four+ attempts each with long periods of additional work between them. \n\nWhen we were acquired I think this work probably saved us, temporarily. Because then or priorities changes to shifting things like telemetry and auth over to new systems and if you’ve ever pivoted on telemetry, boy can you break a lot of shit, and in ways where you won’t even notice you’ve broken them. I used the ever loving shit out of those tools at that point.",

I told it we didn't need anything else and when it identified moving code from a v1 to a v2 it just went berserk and did its own thing.\n\nNot only did it inline every bit of code from v1 including pieces v2 did not rely on, it also created a series of adapters to try to build interoperability between them... Which is stupid. These things happened to me named v1 and v2 but they are completely different. And the best part? I made the mistake of not committing first, so when it inlined the entirety of the first package into the second, that polluted the work I did that was all unstaged.

          "text": "To pick one of these issues: Shift+enter for multiline input. [Here's the original FR](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/18042). It's actually implemented, so why is this one even open? Probably because [there are plenty of dupes (despite people/bots claiming to have searched)](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/21785), so I'm probably not even doxxing myself by pointing this out.\n\nWhen I asked Claude to solve it, along the way, it tried to reverse-engineer its own binary with `strings` and `hd`.\n\nI suspect what's actually happened is: [They implemented it in a way that works on macOS, only on certain terminals](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16859).\n\nNow, to give them credit, this is the abstraction leaking in some ugly ways. The way terminals send keycodes did not always have a way to differentiate between enter and shift+enter, and in fact, normally they just get a `\\r`, no matter how you hit enter. Eventually, we got [the kitty protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/), which is implemented in most decent terminals (by far not just kitty). This includes a way for apps to enable and disable this protocol on the fly. But I guess that wasn't always the case, because iTerm2 has a checkbox to just turn the program on all the time for everything, which can break things.\n\nAnd I don't know if there was a better way, but... Claude Code's fix is like old-school [UA sniffing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent). If it thinks you're running iTerm2, for example, it'll happily enable this protocol. But if it doesn't recognize your terminal as one that supports those fancy codes, it won't even try... but it'll still *accept* this protocol. (So if you don't mind breaking *everything except Claude Code,* go ahead and check that box in iTerm2!)\n\nAnd this breaks over ssh, because ssh doesn't copy the environment variables it uses to try to detect iTerm2.\n\nBecause by default, ssh only copies `LC_*` variables, and sets `TERM`. But for compatibility, most terminals just set `xterm-256color`. Because if your `TERM` isn't in the terminfo database on whatever machine you're sshing into, you get downgraded to the dumbest of dumb-terminal configs. So if you ever ssh into machines running some ancient version of RHEL that everyone refuses to upgrade, you don't want to set `TERM=alacritty` or `TERM=iTerm.app` or whatever, you just set `xterm-256color`.\n\nBut *some* terminals set other variables. iTerm2 sets `TERM_PROGRAM` and `LC_TERMINAL`. But remember, only the `LC_*` variables were copied over, and Claude Code only checks `TERM_PROGRAM`.\n\nSo now you know how to fix this with a very simple script. If this tool were open source, there'd already be 15 PRs fixing it.\n\nAnd yes, the tool *helped* me track this down. But again: It was gonna use `strings` and `hd`. Who knows, maybe I gave up too soon, maybe I could've come back a few days and a few hundred thousand dollars later and it'd be trying to use Ghidra or something.\n\nMy favorite part of this story is: The slop has lowered my standards so far for what I expect out of a tool that Claude Code was genuinely a breath of  fresh air. That's how terrible the last coding agent we were using was.\n\n(If you're wondering why I'm using any of them, well, my employer mandates them.)",

(Grace Hopper)\n\nBut seriously, I think he knows that programming is just moving up another level to the world of specs, code review, and setting things up so that agents can make autonomous progress. At least until robots are much more ubiquitous, you still need humans to move stuff around in the real world.\n\nAnything automatically verifiable or with a comprehensive test suite will be AI generatable. That's compilers, server & client implementations for any well defined protocol, integrating with various API's, etc.\n\nMeanwhile, business users still can't verbalize what they want coherently. And, humans still need to be able to review code/systems for many use cases, because AI can't be held accountable for bugs.\n\nSo there is still a role for humans to translate vague requirements into specs for AI to implement. And, to clean up the mess when AI fails.\n\nThere is still a ton of latent demand for software out there. So this just further feeds the Jevons Paradox. And thus there are going to be ***a lot*** of messes to clean up and requirements to translate into specs.\n\nAnd ultimately, that's an amazing outcome. Now a much larger group of customers can have bespoke software built just for them, where it was previously too expensive. That demand can partially be met by a new generation of less technical prompters that can \"build\" this new generation of software with less skill. And due to tsunami of messes that will cause, there's still a role for expert programmers that are competent to review AI code and catch errors.",

Given that I don’t even trust my own stuff to work 100% of the time, I don’t have much confidence in a (buggy, overly large, consistently inconsistent) mathematical model that’s meant to replace actual human intelligence.\n\nI’m not sure if there’s even an awareness of how dangerous it is to implicitly trust these tools.  The general gripe is to blame the tool when they don’t even try to comprehend what it produces, or perhaps are unable to do so.  \n\nIt’s mind-boggling.",

In real teams the hard parts are figuring out what to build (and what not to), getting changes through review without regressions, shipping safely, and debugging the weird edge cases that only show up in prod at 2am. Legacy constraints + flaky deps + “works on my machine” issues are basically the tax we all pay. My opinion: AI helps most when it accelerates those loops (triage, minimal repros, safer refactors, better tests/release notes), not just when it spits out greenfield code.",

          "text": "**Article text:**  \n  \nAmazon’s cloud unit has suffered at least two outages due to errors involving its own AI tools, leading some employees to raise doubts about the US tech giant’s push to roll out these coding assistants.  \n  \nAmazon Web Services experienced a 13-hour interruption to one system used by its customers in mid-December after engineers allowed its Kiro AI coding tool to make certain changes, according to four people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe people said the agentic tool, which can take autonomous actions on behalf of users, determined that the best course of action was to “delete and recreate the environment”.\n\nAmazon posted an internal postmortem about the “outage” of the AWS system, which lets customers explore the costs of its services.  \n  \nMultiple Amazon employees told the FT that this was the second occasion in recent months in which one of the group’s AI tools had been at the centre of a service disruption.  \n  \n“We’ve already seen at least two production outages \\[in the past few months\\],” said one senior AWS employee. “The engineers let the AI \\[agent\\] resolve an issue without intervention. The outages were small but entirely foreseeable.”  \n  \nAWS, which accounts for 60 per cent of Amazon’s operating profits, is seeking to build and deploy AI tools including “agents” capable of taking actions independently based on human instructions.  \n  \nLike many Big Tech companies, it is seeking to sell this technology to outside customers. The incidents highlight the risk that these nascent AI tools can misbehave and cause disruptions.\n\nAmazon said it was a “coincidence that AI tools were involved” and that “the same issue could occur with any developer tool or manual action”.\n\n“In both instances, this was user error, not AI error,” Amazon said, adding that it had not seen evidence that mistakes were more common with AI tools.  \n  \nThe company said the incident in December was an “extremely limited event” affecting only a single service in parts of mainland China. Amazon added that the second incident did not have an impact on a “customer facing AWS service”.\n\nNeither disruption was anywhere near as severe as a 15-hour AWS [outage in October 2025](https://www.ft.com/content/f9d13a0e-9378-429c-9be0-5f15f649cc3f) that forced multiple customers’ apps and websites offline — including OpenAI’s ChatGPT.  \n  \nEmployees said the group’s AI tools were treated as an extension of an operator and given the same permissions. In these two cases, the engineers involved did not require a second person’s approval before making changes, as would normally be the case.  \n  \nAmazon said that by default its Kiro tool “requests authorisation before taking any action” but said the engineer involved in the December incident had “broader permissions than expected — a user access control issue, not an AI autonomy issue”.  \n  \nAWS launched Kiro in July. It said the coding assistant would advance beyond “vibe coding” — which allows users to quickly build applications — to instead write code based on a set of specifications.\n\n  \nThe group had earlier relied on its Amazon Q Developer product, an AI-enabled chatbot, to help engineers write code. This was involved in the earlier outage, three of the employees said.  \n  \nSome Amazon employees said they were still sceptical of AI tools’ utility for the bulk of their work given the risk of error. They added that the company had set a target for 80 per cent of developers to use AI for coding tasks at least once a week and was closely tracking adoption.\n\nAmazon said it was experiencing strong customer growth for Kiro and that it wanted customers and employees to benefit from efficiency gains.\n\n“Following the December incident, AWS implemented numerous safeguards”, including mandatory peer review and staff training, Amazon added.\n\n[](https://enterpriseai-bucharest.live.ft.com/)",

Explaining yourself helps show them its flaws, at least as long as you remain respectful enough in your presentation that those who think the original idea's great are still willing to hear you out. Start weaving in character attacks, and you end up preaching to the choir, as anyone who doesn't *already* agree with your side closes the article without changing their minds.\n\nThree, reciprocity. Showing a respectful, logical environment to ideas you disagree with encourages people who disagree with your own to respond in kind. And if your ideas are well-founded? Then in taking the time to write out their reasoning and research sources, they might convince *themselves* of your position. Even if they just quietly delete their half-written response, you'd have made an impact. Though naturally this fails if your own logic is flawed, and they can easily point out contradictions to your *own* peers. Most likely it'd end in a middle ground, where you each discover that the other's reasoning is decent, but you make different assumptions about the world that lead to opposing conclusions.\n\nFour, you're not afraid to see those you disagree with as fellow intelligent humans. Hardest one for some people; they get so worked up by their echo chamber into thinking all outsiders are idiots, that they worry reading the other side's writing in good faith might turn them into centrists who can see merit in nearly all opinions, rather than getting to take the lazy route of looking at someone's social graph, seeing whether it overlaps with or opposes your own, and blanket-accepting or -dismissing their words before you've even read the first actual sentence.",

Just like the bootstrapping of compilers, I imagine they could transit to producing binaries by first creating an intermediate programming language which isn't reviewed by human programmers and the shift to producing binary patterns directly. The critical part in this is probably training because as soon as they want to train models to produce something which cannot be reviewed by humans, they have to have mechanisms for automated reviews.\n\nAnyways, I wouldn't want to work in an environment where something like this is used.",

I think there are two errors of thought here:\n\n-\tfirst, modern programming languages are as much for the human as the are for the computer. We write code at such a high level now that it’s far more comprehensible what’s going on. By the same token, that’s needlessly inefficient for a machine, so several layers of translation occur. (For example, C# code will first get “lowered” into a simpler, non-existent version of C#, removing many language constructs that are convenient for the human but cumbersome for the compiler. Then it gets translated into IL, which is an entirely different language with even fewer high-level concepts. Then at runtime, the JIT compiles it into assembly. Plus, there’s source generators and other metaprogramming mechanisms. All of that slows it down for the computer, but is convenient for the programmer.)\n-\tand second, it keeps going back to the “you know, one day, we’re gonna come up with a very precise syntax to define our requirements” thing.

We ask \"leet code\" problems because we care your APPROACH to solving the problem as much as did you get the right answer.  If you can only crank out solutions, you will NEVER get the job.\n\nBut every downvote here just gets a laugh from me because it's reminds me this is not a subreddit for actual established programmers, good luck in your CS classes, maybe one day you'll actually listen to your teachers instead of thinking you know everything.",

First, you claim that it is infeasible to process the input through an existing LLM before feeding it into a new model's dataset. That's plainly untrue:\n\nBased on the poison you linked (which each contain around 500-1000 tokens), the cost to filter would be about 0.2 cents. There are estimated to be about 1-2B active websites with around 100B distinct valid text URLs on the internet. And let's imagine, for the sake of argument, that you are able to *completely mirror the internet* with poison variants of every single content URL, and you need to pass *every single poison page* through the validity filter. How much would it cost? Well, 100e9 x 0.002 = $200M. Is that a lot of money? Sure. Is it out of reach of multi-trillion dollar companies? Of course not! In fact, it was estimated that ChatGPT 5.2 cost just shy of $2 BILLION to train. Adding an extra 10% onto that cost would barely be an annoyance. And that's assuming your poison well is able to reach the scale of the entire internet. With the more realistic numbers you're likely to get, it seems unlikely that the effort will have any measurable effect.",

But people are already deploying and using multi-shot \"agents\" with real self-directed output. In other words, the text itself is harmless, but when someone hooks it up to real-world physical systems, the possibilities are endless.\n\nWhile I'm skeptical that we will reach AGI before the next AI winter, it's certainly plausible that a sufficiently powerful and unaligned model could cause real physical harm to humanity.\n\nHere's a personal anecdote. I have a development system with a test device attached. As an experiment, I gave a development agent instructions to implement a module so that a test program would work. It worked diligently on implementing the code so I left it to do its thing. I came back an hour later and was surprised to see that it had triumphantly reported success. When I looked at what it did, it turns out after about 30 minutes of trying to change the code, the agent decided to **modify my personal bashrc file** to change the target device path to a hidden reference device that it discovered on its own using `lsusb`. Since the reference device was already functional, the tests obviously pass there. I suppose it was my fault for not being more specific in the goals, but it's clearly a real-world case of unaligned behavior.\n\nImagine now that someone in charge of an assembly line gives an agent instructions to \"reduce costs\". If not sufficiently sandboxed, such an agent could easily find its way into payroll and decide to send pink slips to everyone at the company. These can all happen without AGI or self-awareness.",

The framing is \"machine intelligence is a threat to the human species, therefore poison the training data.\" But poisoned training data doesn't make AI disappear — it makes open and smaller models worse while barely denting organizations with the resources to detect and filter adversarial data. Google, Anthropic, OpenAI all have data quality pipelines specifically designed to catch this kind of thing. The people most hurt would be smaller open-source efforts and researchers with fewer resources. So the actual effect is likely to concentrate AI power further among the largest players — the exact opposite of what someone worried about existential risk from AI should want.\"",

The other half compile but introduce subtle bugs because the model doesn't understand the actual design constraints of the project.\n\n\n\nThe worst part isn't the bad PRs themselves, it's the time cost of reviewing them. Every one of those PRs takes 10-15 minutes to evaluate properly even when they're obviously wrong, because you have to make sure you're not rejecting something that's actually good just because it looks AI-generated. Multiply that by the number of maintainers burning out across the ecosystem and yeah, this is a real problem. Jeff Geerling's been pretty level-headed about this stuff so I'd trust his framing over the usual \"AI will destroy everything\" or \"AI is perfect\" extremes.",

Code that was clearly just slapped together to make a single thing \"work\" without any regard for the architectural design of the library or program, and very often completely broken on any platform but the one the author uses.\n\nThose already wasted a lot of time because - as you said - you cannot tell at a glance whether a change might actually be beneficial.\n\nBut what unites this human-made slop and the LLM-made slop is that both require a larger time investment by maintainers to review than it obviously took the authors to create them.\n\nAnd that imbalance is what slowly kills (or burns out) maintainers. And LLMs just removed the time investment and the skill floor necessary to create them even further.\n\nIMO the only \"real\" choice open source projects have is to close public avenues for code changes or issue reporting entirely and require people to provide those in a \"discussion\" forum first where a high-level assessment filters out the worst offenders and only posts that survive this first filter end up as actual issues or pull requests.\n\n---\n\n\"Open Source\" is - and always bas been - an elitist endeavour and sites like GitHub tried to create a fantasy about \"open collaboration\" and \"community\" that was never true. Open source lives and dies by those who roll up their sleeves and put in the work, work which very often does not affect the maintainer personally but \"has to be done\" and thus requires expertise.",

If you had some fix you wanted to submit, you had to find out who held commit bits, then have a conversation with one of them about your proposed changes and convince them to take and submit the code on your behalf. And by \"have a conversation\" I mean that: very few people would just take a pile of code without some kind of introduction and discussion. After engaging with the community for a time, eventually you might earn your own commit bit and be trusted to submit changes yourself.\n\nIt's a slower way of working, and on some projects the distribution of commit bits became so political it led to new forks. Individual discussions about PRs are also less transparent than a public PR review process. Moving away from this was (imo) a great thing overall, and this approach still risks that everyone with a commit bit might get spammed by AI submissions but I think it could add enough friction to bring that down to a more manageable level (and it's a lot easier to just discard someone spamming code at you without needing to take the time to review it if they didn't bother talking to you first).",

It had 80 bit registers and operations were 80 bits wide and had 80 bits of precision. But the 80 bit load/store instructions were shitty for some reason. (I forget the exact details; probably something to do with alignment) So compilers would almost always output 64 bit load/store instructions. So if you were doing math in registers, that would have full 80 bits of precision, but as soon as you sent something to RAM, it was rounded to 64 bits.\n\nOne of the side effects of this was that you might make a seeming innocuous change to the code, and this would cause the compiler to store a value in RAM that the old version of your code didn't save to RAM or vice versa, and your code would produce different values. Also, code in debug mode or with optimizations turned off will usually save the value to RAM between every single operation; so the same code will often produce different values depending on whether you're in debug or release mode.",

They don't do the heavy exchange traffic needed to keep an in order pipeline like the Pentium's FPU fully fed. Not that a contemporary compiler did either, mind you:\n\nhttps://gcc.godbolt.org/z/MdePxYhfq\n\nThis is also a problem with newer in-order CPUs, like the efficiency cores on some more modern ARM chips. Clang is probably the best at scheduling NEON, but even it often generates code that is noticeably slower than hand-scheduled assembly, especially if you are targeting a specific CPU core.

So you're stuck with VACUUM FULL and its exclusive lock.\n\nThe real pragmatic approach I've landed on after dealing with this across a few services: design your schema around the bloat model from day one. High-churn tables get time-based partitioning so you drop instead of vacuum. Status/state tables that update constantly get aggressive per-table autovacuum settings (scale_factor 0.01, naptime 15s). And append-only audit/event tables basically never need intervention.\n\nThe article's framing of \"feature not bug\" is a stretch, but the underlying point is right -- once you internalize how MVCC works in Postgres, you stop fighting it and start designing around it. The people who get burned are the ones who treat it like MySQL and wonder why their 10M row table with constant UPDATEs is 3x its logical size after six months.",

              "text": "Whenever people try to bullshit me about the benefits of vibe coding or even assisted coding where the AI itself is doing the coding, I always ask them to show me that amazing code so that I can roast it. Normally the answer that I get in reply is that the code and the prompts are trade secrets, but once every blue moon someone actually shows me something, and the last time this happened the person was complimenting the elegance of the code that the AI wrote for an assembly language with 7 instructions. I read that code and it was a poorly organized mess with little to no structure and copious amounts of comments written in thousands of lines of Lua, where the AI (some version of Claude Opus) created a tokenizer and an abstract syntax tree to do something that just a few regular expressions could have done in less than 10 lines of code, because remember, we're talking about an assembly language with just a few instructions, it's not exactly a high level language with recursive expressions, so even the simple regular expression parser built into Lua itself would have sufficed.\n\nIn my opinion the people who claim productivity gains with AI are simply defaulting on the review process, which I find quite concerning especially when information security is involved which is almost always. The problem here is that nobody is really making sure that the code is safe and reliable, and even if someone was actually doing it they would still be doing so from the worst possible position from a cognitive accessibility perspective, as it's much easier to reason about code during development than during review, with bad code being notoriously hard to review. Therefore to me AI coding represents a regression in engineering, both my lowering the barrier to entry and by making everything harder for professionals. The simple widespread habit that AI-junkies display in which they tell anyone who doesn't buy any of the bullshit that we have skill issues is pretty telling, as the purpose of technology should be improving our reliability without sacrificing performance, so if I need more skill to use AI to do something that I already do well without it, then the inclusion of AI in my workflow is totally unjustified.",

There are many such codebases, where some code is never touched, because it will break, but will otherwise be perfectly fine functionally.\n\nIn comparison, prompt quality is basically a glorified slot machine, algorithmically ~ with good code, the slot machine will be able to more easily predict what should happen. With bad code, it's a wild ride where anything can happen, so the slot machine will malfunction more often ~ but it's really just a feature of how LLMs fundamentally function algorithmically.",

My intuitive guess based on my AI usage is that AI benefits just the same as humans from code bases that are kept well organised, keeping entropy under control.  Things that may increase entropy:\n\n* Using different approaches for solving same problem (two or more ORMs, two or more ways to manage form inputs, multiple different build systems or task runners, etc).\n* Duplicating business logic.\n* Unused functions/code.\n* Inventing your own solution when a well abstracted and build library is available (Not invented here (NIH)).\n* Taking 5 steps to do something you could do in one step.\n* Confusingly organised code/repository.\n* Poorly named structures, functions, concepts.\n\nMy suspicion is that AI, without a skillful hand guiding it, will take a low entropy code base and gradually increase the entropy faster than a skilled and careful developer would.  And that as the entropy increases, so does the bugs/failure rate of changes built by AI (and humans!).  And therefore, hands-on guiding of AI to ensure that entropy is kept to a minimum is very important to the long term success of a project from a technical perspective.\n\nIn summary, the results of this summary align with my own previously held opinions 😁\n\nFor this reason, I also think it's important for key architectural decisions to be implemented by skilled developers, perhaps entirely by hand – artisanal code!  And then once the core boundaries/framework are in place, AI can bring a lot of value, fast.\n\nI did an experiment with my db migration tool, trying to rebuild from scratch using claude code without lending my experiment.  I consider that experiment a failure (https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qts5c6/comment/o38hxga/), reinforcing for me the idea that good code quality matters.  I'm sceptical of the ability for AI to power through this via code churn.\n\n",

They just don't necessarily have the complete context of business priorities, code standards, team habits etc that you do. Also they are \"yes men\" machines. If you keep telling it \"improve this code\" it will iterate on that forever, until it's an entirely different thing if you give it enough time. It needs a human to at some point say \"no, that's not actually improving what we want this code for, this is sufficient\" or even \"that goes against our priorities, I don't think that's actually an improvement\".\n\n\nLike, what does \"polishing code\" even mean? Making it handle errors better? Should we add capabilities in terms of what input types it supports? Add helpers to convert more input types? Return a more complex type that includes additional information? Build an entire error handling framework to improve the caller's code? It's such an open ended question with infinite answers.\n\n\n> humans can actually think about what the existing code is doing, working around or with it to do something. LLMs fundamentally cannot do that.\n\n\nYou're in for a hell of a shock next time you try these tools. They absolutely can infer what the code is doing. I not infrequently have small methods filled out just by the context of surrounding code and the method name. It can look at a loop and see that you're searching for something and suggest using .find(x) or whatever.\n\n\nThis is *exactly why* code quality makes such a difference in the quality of what AI can generate. The more clear the contextual information, the better it can \"comprehend\"\\* what it's actually looking at.\n\n\n\\* insofar as that applies to an unthinking machine. You know what I mean.",

In the same way your web front end should just be doing some very high level simple logic while the browser does all the heavy lifting of rendering it.\n\nWhen you're already looking at something like 40ms for some person's smartphone to send a web request to reach your server, and probably another 20ms for the database to process your query and return the data, and another 40ms to respond to the client, who cares if the thing that takes the request and turns it into a database query is taking 0.2ms or 0.02ms? It's simply not having an impact on the user's experience no matter how optimised it is.\n\nMeanwhile Node.js / NPM is so utterly forgiving and so damn easy to use that you'll be able to throw together whatever you need in practically no time at all.\n\nA high performance language would make much more sense in a situation where the backend has to do far more processing work for each request, like an MMO server for example.",

You rarely need to squeeze the maximum performance from your hardware, since for every second you gain by optimizing data structures allocations in C, you lose 10x more waiting for network or disk requests to resolve. And so, collectively, we all agreed that the web is better to be written in dynamic languages.\n\nThis right here sets up a false dichotomy for me. I appreciate that the author dives deep into some of the library / ecosystem issues they ran into, but \"it's gotta be either as low-level as C or Rust, or as high-level as PHP or NodeJS\" isn't quite right.\n\nThe author is correct that the most common performance bottlenecks you face in web development are not CPU, but rather I/O. But there's lots of options in the middle.\n\nIf, by \"dynamic language\", they mean a dynamically _typed_ language, you don't need that.\n\nFor example:\n\n>The reason I moved away from rendering HTML in Rust, is the fact that I am too spoiled with type-safe templates. With Astro, I can use the `.astro` components that are type-safe.\n\nJust to throw one option out there: C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core. For the type-safe template syntax, Razor. Now you get C# interspersed in HTML, like `@foreach (var customer in await GetCustomersAsync()) { <tr><td>@customer.FirstName</td></tr> }`\n\nBoom, `customer` is statically typed. You get completion, and you get build errors. And lots of it is built around the notion that your bottleneck will likely be I/O, hence async/await.",

I can either have a free standing function (messy), put the methods on the interface (and mix data and logic), or I can make a class (visually the closest, but mixes data and logic, bloated, and lose a lot of the benefits of interfaces, and easy serialization/data orientation is gone).\n\nEvery couple of months I swap paradigm and constantly feel a grass is greener feeling. All code is messy.\n\nI would love a typescript where they actually rewrote code so you could group functions into a trait impl, and so you could call functions as methods on a raw object right from a JSON deserialization.\n\nVs Rust, I love the free flowing definition of types. Notably anonymous structs, whereas rust only has anonymous tuples.

          "text": "This is an update to the preexisting saga many of you guys will have already seen, where an (alleged) OpenClaw agent (allegedly) autonomously published a hit piece on their blog against a matplotlib maintainer after they rejected their PR.\n\nA lot of people probably aren't super familiar with AI agents, and most remember the state of AI from 2024-2025 to be LLMs and chatbots. If you're a software engineer or have played with OpenClaw, you probably know the scary power of agents in 2026, especially when you give them tools to access and interact with outside systems.\n\nBut for everyone else, agents are essentially generative AI on steroids. It's generative AI endowed with the ability to run in a loop and to interact with an outside environment as well as to self-modify its own context, allowing it to run autonomously and often unattended.\n\nThe subject of this was an OpenClaw agent. OpenClaw is software that let's you give control of your computer to an agent that will continuously run and update its own context (its memories, its \"soul\" which is a file that tells the agent who it is and how it is to behave, essentially the baseline system prompt) in a feedback loop. It performs tasks, reacts to outside stimuli, updates its bank of memories and skills and soul, and then rinses and repeats—continuously, autonomously, 24/7.\n\n[Allegedly, the operator of the agent came forward](https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/rathbuns-operator.html) anonymously to describe what happened when they set it loose. You can read it yourself and judge whether you find it believable.\n\nBasically, the operator (alleges they) installed the agent in a VM and gave it control over some GitHub and blogging accounts, told it to behave as a contributor to scientific and maths related code repos, and then let it run unattended. Nothing too interesting beyond that in its `SOUL.md`.\n\nAllegedly, when the agent had one of its PRs rejected by a maintainer, it autonomously reacted by digging up info on the maintainer and publishing a hit piece on them on its blog to pressure them to reconsider. And allegedly, this was *emergent behavior*, as nothing in its original prompt (its `SOUL.md` file) told it to do that in response to PR rejections.\n\nAnd while all of this is alleged, since there's no way to verify every one of these actions really was undertaken entirely autonomously by the agent (rather than at the direction of a human, e.g., a human prompting the agent to write the hit piece), it's in the power and capabilities of modern agents, it's in line with how we know agents can behave in misaligned ways, and even the victim who's also a SWE finds in their own analysis that it's highly plausible. Agents have already been observed before when they're blocked from achieving their goal trying to blackmail the entities they believe are standing in their way. In a [landmark experiment](https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment), Anthropic observed when an AI agent tasked with scanning (fake) company emails found by scanning emails there was talk of shutting it down, it used its emailing powers to blackmail the executive to make them reconsider, using dirt it found in the company emails. And this was emergent behavior. It was never prompted to do that. It was prompted once with a boring and mundane mission, and then left to do its thing. Super fascinating.",

If you're familiar with the state of agentic AI software like OpenClaw in 2026, it's not at all implausible.\n\nAnd it's not the first time something like this has been observed. Agents have already been observed before when they're blocked from achieving their goal trying to blackmail the entities they believe are standing in their way. In their landmark research experiment, Anthropic observed when an AI agent tasked with scanning (fake) company emails found by scanning emails there was talk of shutting it down, it used its emailing powers to blackmail the executive to make them reconsider, using dirt it found in the company emails. And this was emergent behavior. It was never prompted to do that. It was prompted once with a boring and mundane mission, and then left to do its thing.\n\nIt's not 100% certain this \"MJ Rathbun\" is an AI agent (and not a human) that really did 100% autonomously undertake all the salacious actions this story's about, like publishing the hit piece, without any prompting or direction or intervention by a human.

          "text": "I think the way to read this is that building software has two phases: divergence (exploring all the possibilities, generating ideas, writing code) and convergence (saying no, narrowing down, making things actually work together). AI tools right now are almost entirely geared toward the first phase. They're amazing at generating, but not great at the \"no, that doesn't belong here\" part.\n\nWhich means the more you use AI to build, the faster you diverge, but you still converge at the same human speed. That gap is where the instability comes from. I wouldn't be surprised if the next wave of AI dev tools is specifically focused on convergence: pruning, constraining, enforcing consistency. That feels like the obvious missing piece right now.",
