When everyone could suddenly publish content, platforms had to build reputation graphs — upvotes, trust scores, visibility based on track record. I think open source is going to need something similar. Some kind of contributor reputation system where your history of merged, quality PRs actually affects how your submissions get prioritized for review.\n\nIt won't fully solve it, but the content world has dealt with the \"flood of low-quality submissions\" problem before, and there are learnings we can borrow.",

Have an AI get itself into a position where it can submit slop? That doesn't make sense. Unless it's to actively get into as position where they can submit less suspicious vulnerabilities.

The open source contribution model was built on the assumption that submitting a PR requires enough effort that most spam self-selects out. Now the effort floor is basically zero so every kid with a Claude subscription can shotgun PRs at popular repos hoping something sticks on their GitHub profile.  \n  \n  \nWhat's wild is that the AI slop is often technically correct enough to pass a quick glance but architecturally wrong in ways that take a senior maintainer 20 minutes to explain in a review comment. That's the real cost — not the bad PRs that get rejected in 30 seconds, but the ones that look plausible and waste reviewer time. It's a denial of service attack on maintainer attention and I don't think CLA bots or contributor agreements will fix it.  \n  \n  \nThe web of trust idea sounds nice until you realize it basically recreates the old boys club problem that open source was supposed to fix.

This means that an AI that can reliably detect whether a given fragment is AI slop or not will also be capable of producing AI slop that will pass its own test.\n\nIn other words, training an AI to detect AI output will also train it to produce output that it cannot detect as being AI output.\n\nThe best you can get is probably a model that can detect output from other, weaker, models. But once you roll out such a model, due to the way the competition in that landscape works, people will quickly move to models that can pass that test.\n\nMeanwhile, the false positive rate will go up, and legit human contributions will be rejected for being incorrectly flagged as \"AI slop\".\n\nEither way, humanity loses.\n\nThe best solution we have, unfortunately, is to check for quality issues without worrying too much about whether the author is human or not - if it doesn't fit the coding style, if it doesn't pass the tests, if it doesn't meet the project's readability standards, if the documentation is wrong, if the code doesn't do something that would actually be a useful addition, reject it; and if the contributor isn't capable of being civil and respectful about it and keeps hammering you with low-quality PRs, block (and, in severe cases, report) them.\n\nThis takes a lot of work, but fortunately, at least some of those things can be automated, often without resorting to AI tools. Automated tests exist, coverage checkers exist, linters exist, and integrating them with PR tooling isn't that difficult.",

We can’t keep on relying on GitHub actions for everything.\n\nOne option could be that you cannot open a PR unless you have an issue assigned to you. This isn’t foolproof. Someone could create an issue and assign it to themself. To prevent people from creating PRs that are unrelated to the issues, we can use AI to analyse whether a PR is related to an issue or not. A workflow could be:\nOpen issue > maintainer validates it and assigns it > assignee opens a PR with issue number in title or description > AI analyses the PR and verifies that it foxes the issue that was assigned to them — if no, then the PR is auto closed and locked.\n\nOne of the other comments mentioned vouch, which sounds like a very good idea and we can take it a step further — some sort of global whitelist / blacklist which is used by all popular open source repositories. We can add restrictions based on account age, number of PRs created (if it’s their first PR in a large size repo or they never have a PR merged before, then it’s most likely slop), number of genuine contributions (participation in issues and discussions), etc.\n\nOr, the another option could be to have some sort of system that grants them temporary OTPs which they add to the PR title or description without which the PR will be auto closed. We can leave it to maintainers how they want to distribute these OTPs — Slack/Discord communities, email, etc\n\nSince Github isn’t helping collaborators as proactively as it should, the step most projects are taking is to block public PRs and restrict it to maintainer only. This works very well, but it makes it very difficult for newcomers to contribute in this case.",

The core problem is asymmetry, generating a plausible looking PR now takes 30 seconds but reviewing one still takes 20+ minutes from a senior maintainer.

Explaining yourself helps show them its flaws, at least as long as you remain respectful enough in your presentation that those who think the original idea's great are still willing to hear you out. Start weaving in character attacks, and you end up preaching to the choir, as anyone who doesn't *already* agree with your side closes the article without changing their minds.\n\nThree, reciprocity. Showing a respectful, logical environment to ideas you disagree with encourages people who disagree with your own to respond in kind. And if your ideas are well-founded? Then in taking the time to write out their reasoning and research sources, they might convince *themselves* of your position. Even if they just quietly delete their half-written response, you'd have made an impact. Though naturally this fails if your own logic is flawed, and they can easily point out contradictions to your *own* peers. Most likely it'd end in a middle ground, where you each discover that the other's reasoning is decent, but you make different assumptions about the world that lead to opposing conclusions.\n\nFour, you're not afraid to see those you disagree with as fellow intelligent humans. Hardest one for some people; they get so worked up by their echo chamber into thinking all outsiders are idiots, that they worry reading the other side's writing in good faith might turn them into centrists who can see merit in nearly all opinions, rather than getting to take the lazy route of looking at someone's social graph, seeing whether it overlaps with or opposes your own, and blanket-accepting or -dismissing their words before you've even read the first actual sentence.",

Just like the bootstrapping of compilers, I imagine they could transit to producing binaries by first creating an intermediate programming language which isn't reviewed by human programmers and the shift to producing binary patterns directly. The critical part in this is probably training because as soon as they want to train models to produce something which cannot be reviewed by humans, they have to have mechanisms for automated reviews.\n\nAnyways, I wouldn't want to work in an environment where something like this is used.",

A compiler is already the “idea to binary” machine, except it has a formal language, a spec, deterministic transforms, and a pipeline built around checkability. Same inputs, same output. If it’s wrong, you get an error at a line and a reason.\n\nYes. I think there are two errors of thought here:\n\n-\tfirst, modern programming languages are as much for the human as the are for the computer. We write code at such a high level now that it’s far more comprehensible what’s going on. By the same token, that’s needlessly inefficient for a machine, so several layers of translation occur. (For example, C# code will first get “lowered” into a simpler, non-existent version of C#, removing many language constructs that are convenient for the human but cumbersome for the compiler. Then it gets translated into IL, which is an entirely different language with even fewer high-level concepts. Then at runtime, the JIT compiles it into assembly. Plus, there’s source generators and other metaprogramming mechanisms. All of that slows it down for the computer, but is convenient for the programmer.)\n-\tand second, it keeps going back to the “you know, one day, we’re gonna come up with a very precise syntax to define our requirements” thing. Yeah, but… we already have!",

A compiler takes human readable code from a higher level to machine code that the machine can actually understand. \n\nI agree that \"Skip the code\" is s stupid idea, but can we stop trying to out stupid the people we are arguing with?   Jesus christ this was bad.\n\nEdit: I keep getting downvoted here, and it just reminds me how many junior programmers are here.   \n\nThings this sub needs to learn. \n\nA. When you gain experience and become a senior you start writing more documents and sharing your IDEAS in those documents.\n\nB. You're not an amazing snowflake, a lot of people can do what you can do, your core fundamental skill is not writing the code, but architecting the system/service. \n\nC. We ask Fizzbuzz codes in interviews because we care you can program, anyone can claim what you claim and not have written code. \n\nD. We ask \"leet code\" problems because we care your APPROACH to solving the problem as much as did you get the right answer.  If you can only crank out solutions, you will NEVER get the job.\n\nBut every downvote here just gets a laugh from me because it's reminds me this is not a subreddit for actual established programmers, good luck in your CS classes, maybe one day you'll actually listen to your teachers instead of thinking you know everything.",

If not, then as a developer, my answer would be \"sorry, but no, I don't do unpaid work.\" If they are, then why have them come into the office at all? Sure, it's *possible* to do some work tasks from your phone while crammed into a commuter train during rush hour, but it's certainly not ideal, so why not just let them sit at home, with a beefy laptop, decent coffee, and all the peace and quiet they need to properly focus? And if you absolutely do need them to come into the office at some point, it's probably still better to start their day from home to avoid rush hour traffic, and then pop out a laptop on the now mostly empty train.\n\nBut really I'm pretty sure it's the former, and this CEO is just bone-headedly celebrating what normal people would call \"intruding on your employees' personal life\". Fuck work-life balance, amirite?\n\n> For instance, if you asked what workout music is, you’d get different answers from different people, sometimes based on their geography. Americans tend to prefer hip-hop overall, though millions prefer death metal. And while a number of Europeans would work out to EDM, many Scandinavians like heavy metal.\n\nGuess which continent \"Scandinavia\" is part of.\n\n> The exec also touted Spotify’s ability to build a unique dataset that other LLMs could not commoditize, the way they could other online resources, like Wikipedia. That’s because there’s not always a factual answer for music-related questions, he said.\n\nNo, it's not. It's because they have access to data that nobody else has access to. Wikipedia is public information, so yeah, anyone can train an LLM on that stuff; but Spotify's playlists, tags, usage patterns, etc., are well kept secrets, and a massively valuable dataset that only Spotify has access to. The \"not always a factual answer\" bit is bullshit - if you have the data, you can derive statistical information from it (including LLMs), if you don't, then you can't.",

The best results I've found come from giving the agent good context (design documentation if it's a large enough change) and giving it tasks that are broken down to be testable. The prompts I give are technically detailed but typically not longer than a paragraph. I generally know exactly where I want the changes to be made and what they should look like so I point the agent in that direction, tell it to write tests and to build and run them to verify they pass. \n\n\nEven when programming by hand, my approach has always been iterative. Write a rough first pass and then repeatedly go over the code, refactoring and refining until I'm satisfied. This works very well with AI. The first pass will most likely have problems. My review approach for the output is like half-vibes. Most of my focus is going into the test cases. The rest, I'm looking at the \"shape\" of the code to see if it matches my expectations. \n\n\nIf the tests are too complex to understand quickly, I'll focus on extracting parts of the algorithm that I can test individually and simplifying the test regime. Then on the code side I'll focus on getting the code into a good, maintainable shape. Reducing duplication, improving readability, getting the structure right, etc.\n\n\nThis isn't going to be like a 10x productivity improvement. But it is faster by playing to the strengths of the agents. You only need to type out a sentence or two with each iteration and that's faster than typing the code yourself, keeps the AI doing things it can do pretty reliably, and keeps down the amount of reviewing you need to do at once. Measurements estimate the org has seen low double digit percentage velocity improvements. Sounds about right to me.",

Making sure the code isn't a convoluted mess of logic helps reduce the amount of exponential growth in testing required to handle its edge cases. And second, readable code has a stronger clarity of intent. That means that the agent isn't going to come along and wipe out one of the algorithm's requirements because it was vaguely encoded in two distant pieces of code.\n\n\nAnd to be clear, I'm talking about structural readability issues. Not trivial stuff like naming. The AI is typically pretty good about the trivial stuff. ",

Companies and founders like Legora, Lavoit etc. want talent but when I talked to the CTO/CEO/CPO they can't answer shit about basic engineering questions regarding debugging, systems and scaling. the key thing that should be a red flag about this post is spotify trying to expand to physical books, daniel ek leaving (most likely to avoid getting sued by artists). so much so most of the machine learning community in stockholm takes spotify with a grain of salt and doesn't hold them in high regard now. hence spotify trying to capitalize on london and ny where london has queen mary for ai music and new york. with all the genai stuff happening right now - it's looking like spotify's business model may get rekt by apple, google(youtube) who offer much better audio experiences than them so they want this article to drum up interest ",

First, you claim that it is infeasible to process the input through an existing LLM before feeding it into a new model's dataset. That's plainly untrue:\n\nBased on the poison you linked (which each contain around 500-1000 tokens), the cost to filter would be about 0.2 cents. There are estimated to be about 1-2B active websites with around 100B distinct valid text URLs on the internet. And let's imagine, for the sake of argument, that you are able to *completely mirror the internet* with poison variants of every single content URL, and you need to pass *every single poison page* through the validity filter. How much would it cost? Well, 100e9 x 0.002 = $200M. Is that a lot of money? Sure. Is it out of reach of multi-trillion dollar companies? Of course not! In fact, it was estimated that ChatGPT 5.2 cost just shy of $2 BILLION to train. Adding an extra 10% onto that cost would barely be an annoyance. And that's assuming your poison well is able to reach the scale of the entire internet. With the more realistic numbers you're likely to get, it seems unlikely that the effort will have any measurable effect.",

But people are already deploying and using multi-shot \"agents\" with real self-directed output. In other words, the text itself is harmless, but when someone hooks it up to real-world physical systems, the possibilities are endless.\n\nWhile I'm skeptical that we will reach AGI before the next AI winter, it's certainly plausible that a sufficiently powerful and unaligned model could cause real physical harm to humanity.\n\nHere's a personal anecdote. I have a development system with a test device attached. As an experiment, I gave a development agent instructions to implement a module so that a test program would work. It worked diligently on implementing the code so I left it to do its thing. I came back an hour later and was surprised to see that it had triumphantly reported success. When I looked at what it did, it turns out after about 30 minutes of trying to change the code, the agent decided to **modify my personal bashrc file** to change the target device path to a hidden reference device that it discovered on its own using `lsusb`. Since the reference device was already functional, the tests obviously pass there. I suppose it was my fault for not being more specific in the goals, but it's clearly a real-world case of unaligned behavior.\n\nImagine now that someone in charge of an assembly line gives an agent instructions to \"reduce costs\". If not sufficiently sandboxed, such an agent could easily find its way into payroll and decide to send pink slips to everyone at the company. These can all happen without AGI or self-awareness.",

Most training data was scraped without explicit permission, and retroactive \"well it was publicly available\" arguments don't hold up when the scale of extraction fundamentally changes the economics. A photographer sharing work on Flickr in 2015 didn't consent to that work training a model that competes with them in 2026.\n\nBut poisoning approaches have a collateral damage problem. They don't just affect corporate AI training — they can degrade legitimate research, accessibility tools, translation systems, and other beneficial applications that also rely on web data.\n\nThe real solution is structural: opt-in licensing frameworks, data provenance standards, and actual compensation mechanisms. But nobody wants to build that because it's boring infrastructure work that doesn't generate hype cycles.\n\nUntil then, expect an escalating cold war between scrapers and poisoners, with regular internet users caught in the crossfire.",

I mean Anthropic couldn’t if you actually read their paper, but I’m sure random Joe Schmoe on Reddit is fully capable of poisoning. Come on now, let’s see it. \n\nOr wait, are you going to realize that maybe Anthropic’s paper was right if you read it correctly, and this is really only a threat to open sourced models / poorly curated systems? I think you all forget there’s no confirmed cases of poisoning in ANY big company models. It has only been confirmed, ***in theory***, in a lab, where a model was specifically built and trained to be susceptible to poisoning.",

The framing is \"machine intelligence is a threat to the human species, therefore poison the training data.\" But poisoned training data doesn't make AI disappear — it makes open and smaller models worse while barely denting organizations with the resources to detect and filter adversarial data. Google, Anthropic, OpenAI all have data quality pipelines specifically designed to catch this kind of thing. The people most hurt would be smaller open-source efforts and researchers with fewer resources. So the actual effect is likely to concentrate AI power further among the largest players — the exact opposite of what someone worried about existential risk from AI should want.\"",

It's not a matter of just training it with more and better data; at some point, something has to do the \"thinking\", and these things simply don't have the capability. At best, LLM tech will end up being just the interface between thinking silicon and the outside world, in which case this style of poison doesn't do much.\n\nTheoretical systems that *would* be able to replace the human mind wouldn't be fooled by this style of poison, just as humans right now would look at it and go \"this is complete nonsense, I'm just going to ignore it\".\n\nAll that having been said, fuck LLMs anyway, I'm rooting for this poison to take effect.",

Google+ was a fucked up JS-only site, but here is a link in case someone knows how to extract the chat better: [https://web.archive.org/web/20161108075712/https://plus.google.com/+JunioCHamano/posts/NFjKAX4nE3i](https://web.archive.org/web/20161108075712/https://plus.google.com/+JunioCHamano/posts/NFjKAX4nE3i)\n\nThis was such an eye opener on the [complexities of just handling case sensitivity](https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2018/nov/26/case/). I recommend everyone to check out how messy it is, if they have to deal with issues like that.",

How the decisions of today would impact development decades from now. He just needed to keep the Linux project rolling.\n\nI *do* begrudge the community for deciding that the same tool that was written in a month for a massively complex, ongoing, distributed software project, that uses mailing lists as its primary form of code transfer, was the new de facto standard for version control, when almost none of those conditions apply to most projects. \n\nI mean, we’re in 2026 and there’s not even any **discussion** of how a VCS that takes advantage of reliable internet connection could lead to great new functionality. That’s how I know there has to be a better system possible. Google docs has had this functionality **since 2006** with real time character by character editing since 2010.

I get that it’s for distributed repos, but people working in those repos also need to use it locally. \n\nReferring to a commit by its SHA hash is silly. \n\nMaking every commit a jumping off point, with no “lesser” way to save intermediate progress, is silly.\n\nAdding every file whose changes you want to include every time you commit is silly.\n\nThat .gitignore changes seem to be applied as soon as the file is saved without needing a commit, flying in the face of the rest of git philosophy, is silly.\n\nAnd the fact that we’re in 2026 and our version control systems for distributed repos can’t even take advantage of constant internet connectivity isn’t just silly, it’s obscene. \n\nThe list goes on, but as you said, if you mention it you get flamed by people who think knowing git makes them superior, when the very idea that “superiority” is required to use a VCS is insane.\n\nI can use git perfectly fine. It’s been around since I started learning, so it took a while, but I can. But nobody should have to. That time and effort should be better spent elsewhere.",

It had 80 bit registers and operations were 80 bits wide and had 80 bits of precision. But the 80 bit load/store instructions were shitty for some reason. (I forget the exact details; probably something to do with alignment) So compilers would almost always output 64 bit load/store instructions. So if you were doing math in registers, that would have full 80 bits of precision, but as soon as you sent something to RAM, it was rounded to 64 bits.\n\nOne of the side effects of this was that you might make a seeming innocuous change to the code, and this would cause the compiler to store a value in RAM that the old version of your code didn't save to RAM or vice versa, and your code would produce different values. Also, code in debug mode or with optimizations turned off will usually save the value to RAM between every single operation; so the same code will often produce different values depending on whether you're in debug or release mode.",

Current compilers don't have tuning for old Pentiums, plus x87 is seldom used due to SSE being both faster and easier to use. Thus, even if you get them to use x87, they don't do a great job of interleaving calculations on a 4x4 matrix-vector multiply:\n\nhttps://gcc.godbolt.org/z/YK4nnsr6q\n\nAll three compilers are assuming out of order execution, simply issuing operations in a large batch and only at most using FXCH near the end of the calculation chains. They don't do the heavy exchange traffic needed to keep an in order pipeline like the Pentium's FPU fully fed. Not that a contemporary compiler did either, mind you:\n\nhttps://gcc.godbolt.org/z/MdePxYhfq\n\nThis is also a problem with newer in-order CPUs, like the efficiency cores on some more modern ARM chips. Clang is probably the best at scheduling NEON, but even it often generates code that is noticeably slower than hand-scheduled assembly, especially if you are targeting a specific CPU core. But this too becomes less of an issue as even efficiency cores move to out of order.",

Every one of those PRs takes 10-15 minutes to evaluate properly even when they're obviously wrong, because you have to make sure you're not rejecting something that's actually good just because it looks AI-generated. Multiply that by the number of maintainers burning out across the ecosystem and yeah, this is a real problem.

Code that was clearly just slapped together to make a single thing \"work\" without any regard for the architectural design of the library or program, and very often completely broken on any platform but the one the author uses.\n\nThose already wasted a lot of time because - as you said - you cannot tell at a glance whether a change might actually be beneficial.\n\nBut what unites this human-made slop and the LLM-made slop is that both require a larger time investment by maintainers to review than it obviously took the authors to create them.\n\nAnd that imbalance is what slowly kills (or burns out) maintainers. And LLMs just removed the time investment and the skill floor necessary to create them even further.\n\nIMO the only \"real\" choice open source projects have is to close public avenues for code changes or issue reporting entirely and require people to provide those in a \"discussion\" forum first where a high-level assessment filters out the worst offenders and only posts that survive this first filter end up as actual issues or pull requests.\n\n---\n\n\"Open Source\" is - and always bas been - an elitist endeavour and sites like GitHub tried to create a fantasy about \"open collaboration\" and \"community\" that was never true. Open source lives and dies by those who roll up their sleeves and put in the work, work which very often does not affect the maintainer personally but \"has to be done\" and thus requires expertise.",

                  "text": "I think that aside from the obvious possibility of many projects simply closing the doors to community contributions we may need to bring back some of the old ways.\n\nIn the past, before git existed, some projects limited who could submit changes with a 'commit bit'--anyone with an account on the server could pull the latest changes but by default everyone was read-only. If you had some fix you wanted to submit, you had to find out who held commit bits, then have a conversation with one of them about your proposed changes and convince them to take and submit the code on your behalf. And by \"have a conversation\" I mean that: very few people would just take a pile of code without some kind of introduction and discussion. After engaging with the community for a time, eventually you might earn your own commit bit and be trusted to submit changes yourself.\n\nIt's a slower way of working, and on some projects the distribution of commit bits became so political it led to new forks. Individual discussions about PRs are also less transparent than a public PR review process. Moving away from this was (imo) a great thing overall, and this approach still risks that everyone with a commit bit might get spammed by AI submissions but I think it could add enough friction to bring that down to a more manageable level (and it's a lot easier to just discard someone spamming code at you without needing to take the time to review it if they didn't bother talking to you first).",

But I totally get why it's frustrating when your table balloons to 50GB and you just want the dead rows gone.\n\nThe good thing is that since Postgres is basically a foundation for half the internet at this point, the ecosystem has filled in the gaps. Tools like pg\\_repack existing means you get the best of both worlds, you keep the MVCC design that makes Postgres reliable and you still get a way to clean house without downtime.

So you're stuck with VACUUM FULL and its exclusive lock.\n\nThe real pragmatic approach I've landed on after dealing with this across a few services: design your schema around the bloat model from day one. High-churn tables get time-based partitioning so you drop instead of vacuum. Status/state tables that update constantly get aggressive per-table autovacuum settings (scale_factor 0.01, naptime 15s). And append-only audit/event tables basically never need intervention.\n\nThe article's framing of \"feature not bug\" is a stretch, but the underlying point is right -- once you internalize how MVCC works in Postgres, you stop fighting it and start designing around it. The people who get burned are the ones who treat it like MySQL and wonder why their 10M row table with constant UPDATEs is 3x its logical size after six months.",

Basically if you have a program with lots of data in a performance critical area, the layout of the data in memory can significantly increase cache hits, memory prefetching, lower TLB misses and increase SIMD usage. Going from bad data layout to good data layout can many times lead to even 5x performance gains with the same algorithms. And the problem is that it is reallly easy to have a bad data layout in memory, having it be good doesnt come automatically or naturally to most people.\n\nTLDR of it is use stuctures of arrays and not arrays of structures, optimise for most common data access in mind, stay away from objects and heavy dynamic runtime abstractions in performance critical areas with lots of data, prefer flat arrays with a single type of data. Everything in your CPU and memory is designed with linear and predictable data access of tightly packed memory in mind, so if you have lots of data you should access it like your hardware expects.\n\nif you care to learn more, here are some great talks about it:  \nMore about theory:  \n[CppCon 2014: Mike Acton \"Data-Oriented Design and C++\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc)  \nHow to apply it in practice:  \n[Andrew Kelley: A Practical Guide to Applying Data Oriented Design (DoD)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IroPQ150F6c)\n\nThese concepts apply as much to higher level languages like Java as they do to C++ and alike, so even though the talks show examples with low level languages, don't think that they are somehow irrelevant elsewhere",

A fun consumer product that’s like magic but the underlying trick isn’t that impressive when you know how it works. Quantum processors is the opposite. Feels like absolute magic. Just at the beginning of it being something that you can work on in a research capacity. The next 10-15 years it may go mainstream. Huge implications for data modelling and cryptography,  but it’s not that relatable to the average joe and is hard to even see the magic for it to capture the nation the same way AI has. But I think history will show that it was a much more important breakthrough. ",

Compare that against the future maintenance woes, and that single senior engineer has now created a ticking time bomb.\n\n> Entry-level coders are skipping the “hard way”: they might never build a binary search tree from scratch or debug a memory leak on their own.… The counter-scenario: as AI handles the routine 80%, humans focus on the hardest 20%. Architecture, tricky integrations, creative design, edge cases: the problems machines alone can’t solve. Rather than making deep knowledge obsolete, AI’s ubiquity makes human expertise more important than ever. \n\nYeah, good luck learning those edge cases if you let the AI handle the bulk of the work. How do you learn something you aren’t able to build yourself?\n\n\nLastly on the changing of roles, while I have been seeing that all jobs basically require someone to be a highly-skilled generalist, it is extremely difficult to display that in a resume or interview. I agree new projects to upskill is important, but I haven’t finding that making a strong impact when it comes to proving that lately. ",

Second of all, congratulations, now you have an actual say in things, which means YOU are the person who's paid to stand between the codebase and people trying to ruin it. So obviously everyone from the business side fucking hates you and tries to steamroll over you and the entire dev team 24/7. Whatever devs end up delivering, it's never as fast as the business demanded them to. You can be incredibly productive, but you're still being made feel like a failure for not doing more than humanly possible. And instead of engineering, all day every day you're drowning in people, meetings, confrontations, and sky-high expectations that contradict each other.

I have a Gemini Pro subscription, installed Antigravity, pointed it to a folder with an existing .net implementation of my personal project, asked it to rewrite in python with fastapi. \n\nIt took a long time and a lot of prompts to get rid of the bugs. And it had a fully featured .net implementation as a reference. I was able to spot these issues because I write in python/fastapi at work. I was able to form the right prompts because I work on AI integration at work. \n\nNow in the end. The code quality is pretty bad. Something a junior would write. A lot of bad assumptions (that weren't there in the .net app). Ok, but it works.\n\nThe real problems begin once you leave that conversation and start a new one, for a new feature. You ask it to add something to that code and it no longer has the context of the previous conversation. There are some guidelines.md and what not, but it's not good enough. So it starts implementing a new feature completely disregarding its own bad design choices and creating new ones at best. At worst, it completely misses some interdependencies because it didn't pick the right file to analyze. So instead of grabbing something from a common module, it implements a completely different way to pass it from somewhere else (where it noticed it being used).\n\nOver time, and over multiple conversations, this created a mess so chaotic that when in a new conversation I asked the Pro High thinking model to evaluate the quality of the code base, it absolutely fucking destroyed pretty much every single choice and suggested a complete rewrite. Much to my satisfaction, it said something along the lines of \"the dotnet implementation is clean and well architectured while the one in Python is an entangled mess that is impossible to decipher\".\n\n/edit/ And before anyone tells me Gemini is shit and Claude is better, which I have been told on AI-hyped subreddits. Most of the code was written using Claude Opus 4.6 which Antigrativty lets you choose from, with minor features implemented and code evaluation done by Gemini 3 Pro High.",

But the discourse is so dominated by \"will AI replace us\" that none of it gets any oxygen.  \n  \n  \nI think the actually interesting prediction for the next two years isn't about AI at all. It's about what happens when the generation of developers who learned to code with AI assistance hits the 3-5 year experience mark and runs into problems that require deep understanding of the systems they're working with. We're going to see a talent gap that nobody's talking about because everyone's too busy arguing about whether Claude can write a REST endpoint. It can.

Normally the answer that I get in reply is that the code and the prompts are trade secrets, but once every blue moon someone actually shows me something, and the last time this happened the person was complimenting the elegance of the code that the AI wrote for an assembly language with 7 instructions. I read that code and it was a poorly organized mess with little to no structure and copious amounts of comments written in thousands of lines of Lua, where the AI (some version of Claude Opus) created a tokenizer and an abstract syntax tree to do something that just a few regular expressions could have done in less than 10 lines of code, because remember, we're talking about an assembly language with just a few instructions, it's not exactly a high level language with recursive expressions, so even the simple regular expression parser built into Lua itself would have sufficed.\n\nIn my opinion the people who claim productivity gains with AI are simply defaulting on the review process, which I find quite concerning especially when information security is involved which is almost always. The problem here is that nobody is really making sure that the code is safe and reliable, and even if someone was actually doing it they would still be doing so from the worst possible position from a cognitive accessibility perspective, as it's much easier to reason about code during development than during review, with bad code being notoriously hard to review. Therefore to me AI coding represents a regression in engineering, both my lowering the barrier to entry and by making everything harder for professionals. The simple widespread habit that AI-junkies display in which they tell anyone who doesn't buy any of the bullshit that we have skill issues is pretty telling, as the purpose of technology should be improving our reliability without sacrificing performance, so if I need more skill to use AI to do something that I already do well without it, then the inclusion of AI in my workflow is totally unjustified.",

There are many such codebases, where some code is never touched, because it will break, but will otherwise be perfectly fine functionally.\n\nIn comparison, prompt quality is basically a glorified slot machine, algorithmically ~ with good code, the slot machine will be able to more easily predict what should happen. With bad code, it's a wild ride where anything can happen, so the slot machine will malfunction more often ~ but it's really just a feature of how LLMs fundamentally function algorithmically.",

My intuitive guess based on my AI usage is that AI benefits just the same as humans from code bases that are kept well organised, keeping entropy under control.  Things that may increase entropy:\n\n* Using different approaches for solving same problem (two or more ORMs, two or more ways to manage form inputs, multiple different build systems or task runners, etc).\n* Duplicating business logic.\n* Unused functions/code.\n* Inventing your own solution when a well abstracted and build library is available (Not invented here (NIH)).\n* Taking 5 steps to do something you could do in one step.\n* Confusingly organised code/repository.\n* Poorly named structures, functions, concepts.\n\nMy suspicion is that AI, without a skillful hand guiding it, will take a low entropy code base and gradually increase the entropy faster than a skilled and careful developer would.  And that as the entropy increases, so does the bugs/failure rate of changes built by AI (and humans!).  And therefore, hands-on guiding of AI to ensure that entropy is kept to a minimum is very important to the long term success of a project from a technical perspective.\n\nIn summary, the results of this summary align with my own previously held opinions 😁\n\nFor this reason, I also think it's important for key architectural decisions to be implemented by skilled developers, perhaps entirely by hand – artisanal code!  And then once the core boundaries/framework are in place, AI can bring a lot of value, fast.\n\nI did an experiment with my db migration tool, trying to rebuild from scratch using claude code without lending my experiment.  I consider that experiment a failure (https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qts5c6/comment/o38hxga/), reinforcing for me the idea that good code quality matters.  I'm sceptical of the ability for AI to power through this via code churn.\n\n",

They just don't necessarily have the complete context of business priorities, code standards, team habits etc that you do. Also they are \"yes men\" machines. If you keep telling it \"improve this code\" it will iterate on that forever, until it's an entirely different thing if you give it enough time. It needs a human to at some point say \"no, that's not actually improving what we want this code for, this is sufficient\" or even \"that goes against our priorities, I don't think that's actually an improvement\".\n\n\nLike, what does \"polishing code\" even mean? Making it handle errors better? Should we add capabilities in terms of what input types it supports? Add helpers to convert more input types? Return a more complex type that includes additional information? Build an entire error handling framework to improve the caller's code? It's such an open ended question with infinite answers.\n\n\n> humans can actually think about what the existing code is doing, working around or with it to do something. LLMs fundamentally cannot do that.\n\n\nYou're in for a hell of a shock next time you try these tools. They absolutely can infer what the code is doing. I not infrequently have small methods filled out just by the context of surrounding code and the method name. It can look at a loop and see that you're searching for something and suggest using .find(x) or whatever.\n\n\nThis is *exactly why* code quality makes such a difference in the quality of what AI can generate. The more clear the contextual information, the better it can \"comprehend\"\\* what it's actually looking at.\n\n\n\\* insofar as that applies to an unthinking machine. You know what I mean.",

          "text": "**Article text:**  \n  \nAmazon’s cloud unit has suffered at least two outages due to errors involving its own AI tools, leading some employees to raise doubts about the US tech giant’s push to roll out these coding assistants.  \n  \nAmazon Web Services experienced a 13-hour interruption to one system used by its customers in mid-December after engineers allowed its Kiro AI coding tool to make certain changes, according to four people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe people said the agentic tool, which can take autonomous actions on behalf of users, determined that the best course of action was to “delete and recreate the environment”.\n\nAmazon posted an internal postmortem about the “outage” of the AWS system, which lets customers explore the costs of its services.  \n  \nMultiple Amazon employees told the FT that this was the second occasion in recent months in which one of the group’s AI tools had been at the centre of a service disruption.  \n  \n“We’ve already seen at least two production outages \\[in the past few months\\],” said one senior AWS employee. “The engineers let the AI \\[agent\\] resolve an issue without intervention. The outages were small but entirely foreseeable.”  \n  \nAWS, which accounts for 60 per cent of Amazon’s operating profits, is seeking to build and deploy AI tools including “agents” capable of taking actions independently based on human instructions.  \n  \nLike many Big Tech companies, it is seeking to sell this technology to outside customers. The incidents highlight the risk that these nascent AI tools can misbehave and cause disruptions.\n\nAmazon said it was a “coincidence that AI tools were involved” and that “the same issue could occur with any developer tool or manual action”.\n\n“In both instances, this was user error, not AI error,” Amazon said, adding that it had not seen evidence that mistakes were more common with AI tools.  \n  \nThe company said the incident in December was an “extremely limited event” affecting only a single service in parts of mainland China. Amazon added that the second incident did not have an impact on a “customer facing AWS service”.\n\nNeither disruption was anywhere near as severe as a 15-hour AWS [outage in October 2025](https://www.ft.com/content/f9d13a0e-9378-429c-9be0-5f15f649cc3f) that forced multiple customers’ apps and websites offline — including OpenAI’s ChatGPT.  \n  \nEmployees said the group’s AI tools were treated as an extension of an operator and given the same permissions. In these two cases, the engineers involved did not require a second person’s approval before making changes, as would normally be the case.  \n  \nAmazon said that by default its Kiro tool “requests authorisation before taking any action” but said the engineer involved in the December incident had “broader permissions than expected — a user access control issue, not an AI autonomy issue”.  \n  \nAWS launched Kiro in July. It said the coding assistant would advance beyond “vibe coding” — which allows users to quickly build applications — to instead write code based on a set of specifications.\n\n  \nThe group had earlier relied on its Amazon Q Developer product, an AI-enabled chatbot, to help engineers write code. This was involved in the earlier outage, three of the employees said.  \n  \nSome Amazon employees said they were still sceptical of AI tools’ utility for the bulk of their work given the risk of error. They added that the company had set a target for 80 per cent of developers to use AI for coding tasks at least once a week and was closely tracking adoption.\n\nAmazon said it was experiencing strong customer growth for Kiro and that it wanted customers and employees to benefit from efficiency gains.\n\n“Following the December incident, AWS implemented numerous safeguards”, including mandatory peer review and staff training, Amazon added.\n\n[](https://enterpriseai-bucharest.live.ft.com/)",

That said, \"sending the same tool definition\" (of an optimized size) is actually _more_ efficient than selectively changing tool definitions from call-to-call. As OP noted, they get 95% cache hits so even if you do waste a bunch of context _size_, the constant prefix significantly reduces computation costs which is definitely optimized for Anthropic's wallet, if not your own.\n\n> [gemini] No tool definition overhead at all (the tools are defined server-side, not in the prompt),\n\nI'd imagine gemini does the same as claude but just is less transparent about the context taken up by tool definitions.

          "text": "This is an update to the preexisting saga many of you guys will have already seen, where an (alleged) OpenClaw agent (allegedly) autonomously published a hit piece on their blog against a matplotlib maintainer after they rejected their PR.\n\nA lot of people probably aren't super familiar with AI agents, and most remember the state of AI from 2024-2025 to be LLMs and chatbots. If you're a software engineer or have played with OpenClaw, you probably know the scary power of agents in 2026, especially when you give them tools to access and interact with outside systems.\n\nBut for everyone else, agents are essentially generative AI on steroids. It's generative AI endowed with the ability to run in a loop and to interact with an outside environment as well as to self-modify its own context, allowing it to run autonomously and often unattended.\n\nThe subject of this was an OpenClaw agent. OpenClaw is software that let's you give control of your computer to an agent that will continuously run and update its own context (its memories, its \"soul\" which is a file that tells the agent who it is and how it is to behave, essentially the baseline system prompt) in a feedback loop. It performs tasks, reacts to outside stimuli, updates its bank of memories and skills and soul, and then rinses and repeats—continuously, autonomously, 24/7.\n\n[Allegedly, the operator of the agent came forward](https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/rathbuns-operator.html) anonymously to describe what happened when they set it loose. You can read it yourself and judge whether you find it believable.\n\nBasically, the operator (alleges they) installed the agent in a VM and gave it control over some GitHub and blogging accounts, told it to behave as a contributor to scientific and maths related code repos, and then let it run unattended. Nothing too interesting beyond that in its `SOUL.md`.\n\nAllegedly, when the agent had one of its PRs rejected by a maintainer, it autonomously reacted by digging up info on the maintainer and publishing a hit piece on them on its blog to pressure them to reconsider. And allegedly, this was *emergent behavior*, as nothing in its original prompt (its `SOUL.md` file) told it to do that in response to PR rejections.\n\nAnd while all of this is alleged, since there's no way to verify every one of these actions really was undertaken entirely autonomously by the agent (rather than at the direction of a human, e.g., a human prompting the agent to write the hit piece), it's in the power and capabilities of modern agents, it's in line with how we know agents can behave in misaligned ways, and even the victim who's also a SWE finds in their own analysis that it's highly plausible. Agents have already been observed before when they're blocked from achieving their goal trying to blackmail the entities they believe are standing in their way. In a [landmark experiment](https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment), Anthropic observed when an AI agent tasked with scanning (fake) company emails found by scanning emails there was talk of shutting it down, it used its emailing powers to blackmail the executive to make them reconsider, using dirt it found in the company emails. And this was emergent behavior. It was never prompted to do that. It was prompted once with a boring and mundane mission, and then left to do its thing. Super fascinating.",

There is basic number formatting. Display names and duration are under \"experimental\". I bet that the things that are there - work and stable, but many other things are not there or labeled as experimental.\n\nOn top of all that, how do you integrate it into a translation framework like \"fluent\"? With i18next in node, I can do something like\n\n\\`\\`\\`  \n...  \n\"fileLimit\": \"The file limit is {{sizeLimit, number(notation: compact; style: unit; unit: megabyte; unitDisplay: narrow;)}}\"  \n...  \n\\`\\`\\`\n\nWhich would be formatted correctly, and it's enough to pass just the \\`{sizeLimit: 20}\\`, without the backing needed to care about the formatting, it's all baked into the translation files. There is no equivalent of this in Rust. Fluent has basic support for numbers (and dates if I recall correctly), but that's it.",

In the same way your web front end should just be doing some very high level simple logic while the browser does all the heavy lifting of rendering it.\n\nWhen you're already looking at something like 40ms for some person's smartphone to send a web request to reach your server, and probably another 20ms for the database to process your query and return the data, and another 40ms to respond to the client, who cares if the thing that takes the request and turns it into a database query is taking 0.2ms or 0.02ms? It's simply not having an impact on the user's experience no matter how optimised it is.\n\nMeanwhile Node.js / NPM is so utterly forgiving and so damn easy to use that you'll be able to throw together whatever you need in practically no time at all.\n\nA high performance language would make much more sense in a situation where the backend has to do far more processing work for each request, like an MMO server for example.",

I can either have a free standing function (messy), put the methods on the interface (and mix data and logic), or I can make a class (visually the closest, but mixes data and logic, bloated, and lose a lot of the benefits of interfaces, and easy serialization/data orientation is gone).\n\nEvery couple of months I swap paradigm and constantly feel a grass is greener feeling. All code is messy.\n\nI would love a typescript where they actually rewrote code so you could group functions into a trait impl, and so you could call functions as methods on a raw object right from a JSON deserialization.\n\nVs Rust, I love the free flowing definition of types. Notably anonymous structs, whereas rust only has anonymous tuples. There's plenty you could do to retain the benefits of JavaScript and not have some of the restrictions of Rust (for all I also kinda want those restrictions).\n\nBut Rust was made by actual PL researchers and engineers, and was very well thought out.
