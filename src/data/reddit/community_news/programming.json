              "text": "One of the things that finally struck me at my longest job, that I should have seen earlier, was the evolution of perception that leads people to say something happens “all the time”.\n\nWe make the category error of measuring mistakes as ratios or percentage points but the people who are affected by them think only about frequency, and they form their grievances based on statistical clustering about that frequency. \n\nWhich means if a problem happened twice in one week but usually happens on average once a month, it can now be complained about as an “all the time” issue.\n\nIf you make a process or tool more popular, it fails more often, both in frequency and percentage. Frequency should need no explanation at this point. The tool didn’t magically become less error prone. \n\nBut popularity brings in new participants, and encourages existing ones to use it when they are in less amenable headspace - if something’s hard you put it off until you’re having a good day for deep work, and then you do it. But with more confidence comes more bravado, and more chances for human error. \n\nI have a rule of 2 for these sort of initiatives. If you intend to double the usage of a process, you first need to attempt to make it four times as reliable. That way even if it’s used twice as much, you’ll still have a lower frequency of errors. If you didn’t quite hit the4x target, you’ll still settle in somewhere around 2-3 times the usage. If you did manage 4+, then you’re more likely to get around 3x. \n\nWe had a CD process that ran at a tempo. And a hotfix process that was brittle af, but occasionally got used as a poor man’s canary build to test out major architectural changes and tech debt removal. It was only getting used that way about twice per quarter and the tech debt was getting so bad that people were leaving. \n\nI automated all the bookkeeping parts and also shrunk the run book a bunch, often while working on other stuff (like tech debt removal). Eventually we went from using it twice a quarter to twice a week. Which was gratifying but the part I didn’t anticipate is that it got people off the fence on tech debt. All those extra uses were in service of testing riskier changes, often four+ attempts each with long periods of additional work between them. \n\nWhen we were acquired I think this work probably saved us, temporarily. Because then or priorities changes to shifting things like telemetry and auth over to new systems and if you’ve ever pivoted on telemetry, boy can you break a lot of shit, and in ways where you won’t even notice you’ve broken them. I used the ever loving shit out of those tools at that point.",

We had a version 1 and 2 of some code packages and I asked it to find dependencies from the first package and inline them in the second because we were about to delete the first package. I told it we didn't need anything else and when it identified moving code from a v1 to a v2 it just went berserk and did its own thing.\n\nNot only did it inline every bit of code from v1 including pieces v2 did not rely on, it also created a series of adapters to try to build interoperability between them... Which is stupid. These things happened to me named v1 and v2 but they are completely different. And the best part? I made the mistake of not committing first, so when it inlined the entirety of the first package into the second, that polluted the work I did that was all unstaged.

              "text": "> I've heard countless of veteran programmers talk about all the issues with object oriented programming.\n\nI've been programming for fifty years now. I remember when object-oriented programming was the big new thing.\n\nWhile I prefer pure functions (of course :-D), all else being equal, object-oriented programming worked out extremely well.\n\nOh, I've seen some horrible OOP programs, I don't even have the time to get started, but the thing is, these people would have written programs that were just as horrible or even more horrible without OOP.\n\nIt was only when I started programming with junior programmer that I realized that the strength of OOP is that it works pretty well for juniors who need to re-use code, and it doesn't naturally encourage bad design: it's neutral. Of course, Maslow's Law of the Instrument applies, but it really does work.\n\nFor example, I personally think functional programming often gives better results, but the sort of code written by people who are obsessed with this technique can be very difficult to understand and maintain - it has more trap aspects.\n\nAnd of course, don't get me started with AI. Sometimes it's like it's deliberately mocking me. :-D \"I spent 15 minutes reading this part, and this page of code could be replaced by a single look up dictionary with 6 entries, and that would also remove the gross failure modes.\"",

On the other hand, while I still understand the code it writes I don’t have the same muscle memory for where things are in a project. I wouldn’t want to be entering the field right now because unlike my early experience you aren’t going to get paid to learn anymore. Most devs coming up now will probably not be able to work without these tools if they aren’t very disciplined about slow learning through repetition. \n\nIf you’ve tried the high end version of these tools and don’t think it’s going to change our industry you are being naive and myopic.\n\nYou know who cares about software and how it’s written? People like the ones reading this sub. \n\nYou know who doesn’t care in the least as long as it does what they want? 99.9% of the people that use software.\n\nIt doesn’t feel great but it is what it is. The last 15 years of development have become very abstracted.  How much could most devs do without packages that most devs have never read a line of? When you compile something, the code running is not what you wrote its a translated version.\n\nI just see these tools as another layer of abstraction.

          "text": "To pick one of these issues: Shift+enter for multiline input. [Here's the original FR](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/18042). It's actually implemented, so why is this one even open? Probably because [there are plenty of dupes (despite people/bots claiming to have searched)](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/21785), so I'm probably not even doxxing myself by pointing this out.\n\nWhen I asked Claude to solve it, along the way, it tried to reverse-engineer its own binary with `strings` and `hd`.\n\nI suspect what's actually happened is: [They implemented it in a way that works on macOS, only on certain terminals](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16859).\n\nNow, to give them credit, this is the abstraction leaking in some ugly ways. The way terminals send keycodes did not always have a way to differentiate between enter and shift+enter, and in fact, normally they just get a `\\r`, no matter how you hit enter. Eventually, we got [the kitty protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/), which is implemented in most decent terminals (by far not just kitty). This includes a way for apps to enable and disable this protocol on the fly. But I guess that wasn't always the case, because iTerm2 has a checkbox to just turn the program on all the time for everything, which can break things.\n\nAnd I don't know if there was a better way, but... Claude Code's fix is like old-school [UA sniffing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent). If it thinks you're running iTerm2, for example, it'll happily enable this protocol. But if it doesn't recognize your terminal as one that supports those fancy codes, it won't even try... but it'll still *accept* this protocol. (So if you don't mind breaking *everything except Claude Code,* go ahead and check that box in iTerm2!)\n\nAnd this breaks over ssh, because ssh doesn't copy the environment variables it uses to try to detect iTerm2.\n\nBecause by default, ssh only copies `LC_*` variables, and sets `TERM`. But for compatibility, most terminals just set `xterm-256color`. Because if your `TERM` isn't in the terminfo database on whatever machine you're sshing into, you get downgraded to the dumbest of dumb-terminal configs. So if you ever ssh into machines running some ancient version of RHEL that everyone refuses to upgrade, you don't want to set `TERM=alacritty` or `TERM=iTerm.app` or whatever, you just set `xterm-256color`.\n\nBut *some* terminals set other variables. iTerm2 sets `TERM_PROGRAM` and `LC_TERMINAL`. But remember, only the `LC_*` variables were copied over, and Claude Code only checks `TERM_PROGRAM`.\n\nSo now you know how to fix this with a very simple script. If this tool were open source, there'd already be 15 PRs fixing it.\n\nAnd yes, the tool *helped* me track this down. But again: It was gonna use `strings` and `hd`. Who knows, maybe I gave up too soon, maybe I could've come back a few days and a few hundred thousand dollars later and it'd be trying to use Ghidra or something.\n\nMy favorite part of this story is: The slop has lowered my standards so far for what I expect out of a tool that Claude Code was genuinely a breath of  fresh air. That's how terrible the last coding agent we were using was.\n\n(If you're wondering why I'm using any of them, well, my employer mandates them.)",

Just wanted a canvas to draw a height map on to make rudimentary island/country shapes.\n\nIt took about an hour and a half to get a non-functional canvas after frequent back and forth between it spitting out Godot *2*\\-compatible GDScript, misremembering names of functions and variables or just making up new ones toward the end of the script, and error corrections that only caused further problems deeper in. Also it hates giving me copy-paste tabbed code so had to manually adjust every 4-space gap with a proper tab to make anything work.\n\nI'm just gonna learn how to program it myself, as indecipherable as the documentation feels looking at the nodes I think I need, it's probably easier than learning how to wrangle an AI that doesn't listen to \"I'm using Godot 4.6\" at the start.",

(Grace Hopper)\n\nBut seriously, I think he knows that programming is just moving up another level to the world of specs, code review, and setting things up so that agents can make autonomous progress. At least until robots are much more ubiquitous, you still need humans to move stuff around in the real world.\n\nAnything automatically verifiable or with a comprehensive test suite will be AI generatable. That's compilers, server & client implementations for any well defined protocol, integrating with various API's, etc.\n\nMeanwhile, business users still can't verbalize what they want coherently. And, humans still need to be able to review code/systems for many use cases, because AI can't be held accountable for bugs.\n\nSo there is still a role for humans to translate vague requirements into specs for AI to implement. And, to clean up the mess when AI fails.\n\nThere is still a ton of latent demand for software out there. So this just further feeds the Jevons Paradox. And thus there are going to be ***a lot*** of messes to clean up and requirements to translate into specs.\n\nAnd ultimately, that's an amazing outcome. Now a much larger group of customers can have bespoke software built just for them, where it was previously too expensive. That demand can partially be met by a new generation of less technical prompters that can \"build\" this new generation of software with less skill. And due to tsunami of messes that will cause, there's still a role for expert programmers that are competent to review AI code and catch errors.",

          "text": "**Article text:**  \n  \nAmazon’s cloud unit has suffered at least two outages due to errors involving its own AI tools, leading some employees to raise doubts about the US tech giant’s push to roll out these coding assistants.  \n  \nAmazon Web Services experienced a 13-hour interruption to one system used by its customers in mid-December after engineers allowed its Kiro AI coding tool to make certain changes, according to four people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe people said the agentic tool, which can take autonomous actions on behalf of users, determined that the best course of action was to “delete and recreate the environment”.\n\nAmazon posted an internal postmortem about the “outage” of the AWS system, which lets customers explore the costs of its services.  \n  \nMultiple Amazon employees told the FT that this was the second occasion in recent months in which one of the group’s AI tools had been at the centre of a service disruption.  \n  \n“We’ve already seen at least two production outages \\[in the past few months\\],” said one senior AWS employee. “The engineers let the AI \\[agent\\] resolve an issue without intervention. The outages were small but entirely foreseeable.”  \n  \nAWS, which accounts for 60 per cent of Amazon’s operating profits, is seeking to build and deploy AI tools including “agents” capable of taking actions independently based on human instructions.  \n  \nLike many Big Tech companies, it is seeking to sell this technology to outside customers. The incidents highlight the risk that these nascent AI tools can misbehave and cause disruptions.\n\nAmazon said it was a “coincidence that AI tools were involved” and that “the same issue could occur with any developer tool or manual action”.\n\n“In both instances, this was user error, not AI error,” Amazon said, adding that it had not seen evidence that mistakes were more common with AI tools.  \n  \nThe company said the incident in December was an “extremely limited event” affecting only a single service in parts of mainland China. Amazon added that the second incident did not have an impact on a “customer facing AWS service”.\n\nNeither disruption was anywhere near as severe as a 15-hour AWS [outage in October 2025](https://www.ft.com/content/f9d13a0e-9378-429c-9be0-5f15f649cc3f) that forced multiple customers’ apps and websites offline — including OpenAI’s ChatGPT.  \n  \nEmployees said the group’s AI tools were treated as an extension of an operator and given the same permissions. In these two cases, the engineers involved did not require a second person’s approval before making changes, as would normally be the case.  \n  \nAmazon said that by default its Kiro tool “requests authorisation before taking any action” but said the engineer involved in the December incident had “broader permissions than expected — a user access control issue, not an AI autonomy issue”.  \n  \nAWS launched Kiro in July. It said the coding assistant would advance beyond “vibe coding” — which allows users to quickly build applications — to instead write code based on a set of specifications.\n\n  \nThe group had earlier relied on its Amazon Q Developer product, an AI-enabled chatbot, to help engineers write code. This was involved in the earlier outage, three of the employees said.  \n  \nSome Amazon employees said they were still sceptical of AI tools’ utility for the bulk of their work given the risk of error. They added that the company had set a target for 80 per cent of developers to use AI for coding tasks at least once a week and was closely tracking adoption.\n\nAmazon said it was experiencing strong customer growth for Kiro and that it wanted customers and employees to benefit from efficiency gains.\n\n“Following the December incident, AWS implemented numerous safeguards”, including mandatory peer review and staff training, Amazon added.\n\n[](https://enterpriseai-bucharest.live.ft.com/)",

First, you claim that it is infeasible to process the input through an existing LLM before feeding it into a new model's dataset. That's plainly untrue:\n\nBased on the poison you linked (which each contain around 500-1000 tokens), the cost to filter would be about 0.2 cents. There are estimated to be about 1-2B active websites with around 100B distinct valid text URLs on the internet. And let's imagine, for the sake of argument, that you are able to *completely mirror the internet* with poison variants of every single content URL, and you need to pass *every single poison page* through the validity filter. How much would it cost? Well, 100e9 x 0.002 = $200M. Is that a lot of money? Sure. Is it out of reach of multi-trillion dollar companies? Of course not! In fact, it was estimated that ChatGPT 5.2 cost just shy of $2 BILLION to train. Adding an extra 10% onto that cost would barely be an annoyance. And that's assuming your poison well is able to reach the scale of the entire internet. With the more realistic numbers you're likely to get, it seems unlikely that the effort will have any measurable effect.",

But people are already deploying and using multi-shot \"agents\" with real self-directed output. In other words, the text itself is harmless, but when someone hooks it up to real-world physical systems, the possibilities are endless.\n\nWhile I'm skeptical that we will reach AGI before the next AI winter, it's certainly plausible that a sufficiently powerful and unaligned model could cause real physical harm to humanity.\n\nHere's a personal anecdote. I have a development system with a test device attached. As an experiment, I gave a development agent instructions to implement a module so that a test program would work. It worked diligently on implementing the code so I left it to do its thing. I came back an hour later and was surprised to see that it had triumphantly reported success. When I looked at what it did, it turns out after about 30 minutes of trying to change the code, the agent decided to **modify my personal bashrc file** to change the target device path to a hidden reference device that it discovered on its own using `lsusb`. Since the reference device was already functional, the tests obviously pass there. I suppose it was my fault for not being more specific in the goals, but it's clearly a real-world case of unaligned behavior.\n\nImagine now that someone in charge of an assembly line gives an agent instructions to \"reduce costs\". If not sufficiently sandboxed, such an agent could easily find its way into payroll and decide to send pink slips to everyone at the company. These can all happen without AGI or self-awareness.",

The framing is \"machine intelligence is a threat to the human species, therefore poison the training data.\" But poisoned training data doesn't make AI disappear — it makes open and smaller models worse while barely denting organizations with the resources to detect and filter adversarial data. Google, Anthropic, OpenAI all have data quality pipelines specifically designed to catch this kind of thing. The people most hurt would be smaller open-source efforts and researchers with fewer resources. So the actual effect is likely to concentrate AI power further among the largest players — the exact opposite of what someone worried about existential risk from AI should want.\"",

You'd need to sustain terabytes daily for years to meaningfully shift the distribution, and by then you've probably wrecked more small projects depending on clean web data than you've hurt any large AI company. I get the anger. I really do. I've watched open source repos I contributed to get scraped without attribution, and that sucks. But this is basically the tech equivalent of keying a rental car because you're mad at the rental company. The rental company doesn't care. The next person renting the car does.

Most training data was scraped without explicit permission, and retroactive \"well it was publicly available\" arguments don't hold up when the scale of extraction fundamentally changes the economics. A photographer sharing work on Flickr in 2015 didn't consent to that work training a model that competes with them in 2026.\n\nBut poisoning approaches have a collateral damage problem. They don't just affect corporate AI training — they can degrade legitimate research, accessibility tools, translation systems, and other beneficial applications that also rely on web data.\n\nThe real solution is structural: opt-in licensing frameworks, data provenance standards, and actual compensation mechanisms. But nobody wants to build that because it's boring infrastructure work that doesn't generate hype cycles.\n\nUntil then, expect an escalating cold war between scrapers and poisoners, with regular internet users caught in the crossfire.",

That didn't always mean it was worth your time, as anyone who's fallen for a u/shittymorph post knows, but it was at least more likely than your average typo-ridden run-on CAPSLOCK-ENABLED garbage that showed someone either made zero effort, or had zero education, or both.\n\nAnd if it turned into a debate, at least there was some symmetry of effort. Sure, the Gish Gallop was always a thing, but at a basic level, if I put in some real effort tearing apart some well-presented-but-baseless argument, they'd have to put some effort into their response to at least *appear* to be holding their own. If they immediately descend into name-calling, then it's a lot more obvious that there wasn't much to that initial post. (Maybe it was just copypasta.)\n\nLLMs broke that entirely. They even turned it on its head: Now, the cleaner your syntax and prose, the more that's an indication of a *lack of* effort. From the article, one of the hallmarks of a machine-generated submission is:\n\n> Variables and functions named with an eerie, sterile perfection that no human programmer running on caffeine and zero sleep has ever achieved.\n\nThat's right, code that reads *too clearly* looks low-effort. `foo` and `bar` are the new clean code? ...well, no, not really. Proper spelling and grammar are still expected. But the lowest-effort slop looks a lot more like the highest-effort, highest-quality code (or prose).\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, like you see all over this thread, plenty of actually-good people are starting to use LLMs for at least *some* of what they're doing, whether they want to or not. My employer mandates Claude Code.\n\nThat's why this sucks so much for these maintainers: It's not just the sheer volume of extra stuff to review, it's that all the normal ways of filtering low-effort submissions have stopped working.",

If you ask the \"author\" to change something, they'll just feed your comments to the LLM - which will see it as an opportunity to other things, not just what you asked to change. So you have to read everything again.\n3. LLMs are really good at disguising how bad their output is.\n\nI want to focus on that last point. Neural networks can get very very good at what you train them to do, but the ones that became a synonym with \"AI\" are the ones that are easy for the end user to use because they were trained at the art of conversation - the Large Language Models.\n\nWhen you learn a language from reading text in it, you also gain some knowledge about the subject of that text. And thus, when learning language, the LLMs also learned various things. With the vast resources invested in training them, these \"various things\" added up to a very impressive curriculum. But the central focus of the GPT algorithm is still learning how to talk - so with more training this ability will grow faster than any other ability.\n\nThis means that if the relevant \"professional training\" of the LLM fails to provide a correct answer to your request - a smooth talk training, orders of magnitude more advanced, kicks in and uses the sum of compute power capitalism could muster to coax you into believing whatever nonsense the machine came up with instead.\n\nA human programmer that sends you a bad PR is probably not a world class conman.

Mistakes aren't just bugs, they can also be bad decisions like UX, or misunderstanding requirements. Taking critical thinking out of the earliest part of the process may be offset by pushing bug discovery to later, where it's more expensive.\n* We spend 80% of our dev time on maintenance, not the initial creation.\n* Even when creating and maintaining, code review and coming to agreement is typically the bottleneck, moreso than writing the code.\n\nWhere the LLMs can help us iterate faster, we do get an improvement. Or, as many have said, proof-of-concept code, or code that is highly memorization-based or heavy on boilerplate (like CI/CD pipelines), or places where we need something but we don't need to care about quality. It has a place in the toolbelt. Maybe they solve the \"junior engineer\" problem - but in a way that cuts off a pathway for juniors to become seniors, punting a now problem to be a future problem.\n\nIn fact, re: bullet #3 and the code review pipeline being the bottleneck - we are seeing open source projects start to turn off accepting PRs because LLMs can generate at a volume that cannot be sustained by review. That is in fact *exacerbating* our problems, not solving them.\n\nAnd I don't think LLMs will be a panacea for code review, either. I do not believe that LLMs have found a hack or cheat that gets around Rice's theorem. There's still no evidence that we'll get above 90% confidence without spending *so much* energy that profit for the AI providers is impossible. Eventually, their investors will demand that they get to profitability.",

Unfortunately, the clients are all very busy and can't/won't/don't devote enough time to validating and approving items, so I often find myself twiddling my thumbs. And when I do have an item, I have to spend days waiting for them to answer my question(s) about implementation details because, surprise!, they didn't give us good requirements.",

Every dev has faced the situation where starting over and rewriting from scratch was needed and suddenly a piece of software you had spent maybe six months to a year working on you recreate in a few days. Well that's the part of your time that was spent typing in the code. All the rest of the time was the time spent solving all the problems, iterating on the design, refining the logic and generally dog fooding the product to find out what did or didn't work.\n\nThe worry I have is that a tool that can rapidly recreate someone else's hard work is still highly problematic. That the likes of Meta sees a future where instead of having to buy the next WhatsApp they just have a single dev direct an AI to make a clone as soon as the competitor starts to get off the ground and use their existing dominant market position to squelch out the competition far quicker than they could now if they had to spend time and effort to make a competing product.",

Claude is excellent at doing a well written, direct, 1 point ticket.\n\nIf we can change how we structure or work to have a lot of 1 point tickets, that can be a large speedup. Even something as simple as adding an empty stub for a new route, and then empty stubs for the tests, can save 20 minutes. The next ticket can be just a DB migration to add a table. The next ticket can be to add an insert to that for the DB layer. The next is some verification … and so on.\n\nThe point being individually these is really simple. When you have 20 minutes saved * 6 tickets, that’s suddenly half your day saved.\n\nI think what’s key is people know exactly what they want, before they go to the LLM.

I'm reminded of this passage from *The Mythical Man-Month*:\n\n> Intercommunication is worse. If each part of the task must be separately coordinated with each other part, the effort increases as n(n-1)/2. Three workers require three times as much pairwise intercommunication as two; four require six times as much as two. If, moreover, there need to be conferences among the three, four, etc., workers to resolve things jointly, matters get worse yet. The added effort of communicating may fully counteract the division of the original task and bring us to the situation of Fig 2.4.\n\n> Since software construction is inherently a systems effort -- an exercise in complex interrelationships -- communication effort is great, and it quickly dominates the decrease in individual task time brought about by partitioning. Adding more men then lengthens, not shortens, the schedule.\n\nWhile this was written more than 50 years ago, and was written in the context about how adding more people to a late project makes it later, the highlighting of the impact of communication applies more broadly in software development and still rings true today.",

By the time I left the team the total code that I'd written for this \"feature\" was a couple hundred lines, tops.\n> ...\n>\n> In Windows, this model breaks down simply because there are far too many developers to access one central repository. So Windows has a tree of repositories: developers check in to the nodes, and periodically the changes in the nodes are integrated up one level in the hierarchy. At a different periodicity, changes are integrated down the tree from the root to the nodes. In Windows, the node I was working on was 4 levels removed from the root. The periodicity of integration decayed exponentially and unpredictably as you approached the root so it ended up that it took between 1 and 3 months for my code to get to the root node, and some multiple of that for it to reach the other nodes. It should be noted too that the only common ancestor that my team, the shell team, and the kernel team shared was the root.\n>\n> ...\n> The end result of all this is what finally shipped: the lowest common denominator, the simplest and least controversial option.",

All chromium based browsers implement it, and Safari and Firefox are working on supporting it. On the server side, recent versions of Node.js and Python have support, and mature libraries are available in other languages.

Pre-shared dictionaries have always worked in theory, but you needed to solve three things simultaneously: (1) how the browser discovers/fetches the dictionary, (2) how to invalidate the cached dictionary when your bundle changes, and (3) server-side support without custom-patching your CDN or reverse proxy.\n\nThe Use-As-Dictionary + Available-Dictionary header negotiation is what actually changes the equation — browsers can now handle dictionary selection automatically as part of normal HTTP semantics. That's the part that's \"finally here\".\n\nThe comment about adaptive/prunable dictionaries is interesting too — that would essentially be streaming dictionary updates via delta hashing, roughly how rsync's rolling checksum works. Doable, but you'd need the browser to maintain a sliding window of previous responses. Probably overkill for most use cases, but someone will build it.",

Programming does it all the time, replacing an enumerated value integer instead of a longer text string.

This of course would require finding the sweet spot between savings vs the size of the dictionary itself. The dictionary itself might become unoptimal over time as development trends shift, e.g. if everyone starts using a newer keyword frequently or a new framework like Tailwind that changes the characteristics of the code.

Not to mention that taking a stance of an absolute feels wild to me, too.

I think people are finding that \"less is more\". That said, \"sending the same tool definition\" (of an optimized size) is actually _more_ efficient than selectively changing tool definitions from call-to-call. As OP noted, they get 95% cache hits so even if you do waste a bunch of context _size_, the constant prefix significantly reduces computation costs which is definitely optimized for Anthropic's wallet, if not your own.\n\n> [gemini] No tool definition overhead at all (the tools are defined server-side, not in the prompt),\n\nI'd imagine gemini does the same as claude but just is less transparent about the context taken up by tool definitions. There's nothing magic about LLM context, if the tools are defined server-side then I guess all customers probably share the same cache - but they _are_ included in the context even if hidden from you.",

If you're using a different model, the resulting computation is going to be wildly different even with the same input so you're not going to have any cache overlap between models.\n\nVery interesting post, thanks for sharing!",

Cursor is way more conservative about what it sends, which means it's cheaper per session but sometimes misses relevant context. Claude Code seems to just throw everything at the wall, which works better for complex multi-file changes but costs 3-4x as much for a typical hour of work. The Gemini approach of dumping full git history is honestly hilarious. I can see why they thought it was a good idea -- more context equals better understanding, right? -- but in practice you're spending tokens on commit messages from 2019 that have zero relevance to the current task. What I really want is something like a .contextignore file that lets me tell the tool \"don't bother looking at these directories or these file patterns.\" Some tools sort of have this but it's still clunky. Whoever solves intelligent context pruning first basically wins the AI coding tools race, because the model quality gap is narrowing fast but the efficiency gap is still huge.",

In the same way your web front end should just be doing some very high level simple logic while the browser does all the heavy lifting of rendering it.\n\nWhen you're already looking at something like 40ms for some person's smartphone to send a web request to reach your server, and probably another 20ms for the database to process your query and return the data, and another 40ms to respond to the client, who cares if the thing that takes the request and turns it into a database query is taking 0.2ms or 0.02ms? It's simply not having an impact on the user's experience no matter how optimised it is.\n\nMeanwhile Node.js / NPM is so utterly forgiving and so damn easy to use that you'll be able to throw together whatever you need in practically no time at all.\n\nA high performance language would make much more sense in a situation where the backend has to do far more processing work for each request, like an MMO server for example.",

The interaction between rich localization and internationalization is not complete yet. But I wouldn't make a claim that there is no i18n.

Now you get C# interspersed in HTML, like `@foreach (var customer in await GetCustomersAsync()) { <tr><td>@customer.FirstName</td></tr> }`\n\nBoom, `customer` is statically typed.

I can either have a free standing function (messy), put the methods on the interface (and mix data and logic), or I can make a class (visually the closest, but mixes data and logic, bloated, and lose a lot of the benefits of interfaces, and easy serialization/data orientation is gone).\n\nEvery couple of months I swap paradigm and constantly feel a grass is greener feeling. All code is messy.\n\nI would love a typescript where they actually rewrote code so you could group functions into a trait impl, and so you could call functions as methods on a raw object right from a JSON deserialization.\n\nVs Rust, I love the free flowing definition of types. Notably anonymous structs, whereas rust only has anonymous tuples. There's plenty you could do to retain the benefits of JavaScript and not have some of the restrictions of Rust (for all I also kinda want those restrictions).\n\nBut Rust was made by actual PL researchers and engineers, and was very well thought out.

And there's no point to applying confusability first, because as you mentioned in your post, confusability is not intended to produce a linguistically-similar representation of the input text.\n\nConfusability is for humans. If you plan to use both it and NFKC, you *must* apply and store them separately because they're used for different purposes. tr39 is pretty clear:\n\n> A skeleton is intended only for internal use for testing confusability of strings; the resulting text is not suitable for display to users, because it will appear to be a hodgepodge of different scripts. In particular, the result of mapping an identifier will not necessary be an identifier. Thus the confusability mappings can be used to test whether two identifiers are confusable (if their skeletons are the same), but should definitely not be used as a \"normalization\" of identifiers.",

Your system would flag ſ as an f-lookalike (it’s actually s), flag mathematical zeros as o-lookalikes (they’re actually 0), and flag mathematical ones as l-lookalikes (they’re actually 1).

If you’re not doing compatibility normalization, these are precisely the results you want. The first case would be a problem if you then display a compatibility normalized form to users without doing confusable checking again, which is obviously incorrect but I suppose someone could do that by mistake.

This is a big problem with protobuf generated code, which there's a big stack of when you get into certain ecosystems (and a weirdly huge amount of `envoy` stuff).\n\nI'd love it if Go could do something about this, although the most practical answer is probably for protobuf to improve the quality of code it generates.",

          "text": "This is an update to the preexisting saga many of you guys will have already seen, where an (alleged) OpenClaw agent (allegedly) autonomously published a hit piece on their blog against a matplotlib maintainer after they rejected their PR.\n\nA lot of people probably aren't super familiar with AI agents, and most remember the state of AI from 2024-2025 to be LLMs and chatbots. If you're a software engineer or have played with OpenClaw, you probably know the scary power of agents in 2026, especially when you give them tools to access and interact with outside systems.\n\nBut for everyone else, agents are essentially generative AI on steroids. It's generative AI endowed with the ability to run in a loop and to interact with an outside environment as well as to self-modify its own context, allowing it to run autonomously and often unattended.\n\nThe subject of this was an OpenClaw agent. OpenClaw is software that let's you give control of your computer to an agent that will continuously run and update its own context (its memories, its \"soul\" which is a file that tells the agent who it is and how it is to behave, essentially the baseline system prompt) in a feedback loop. It performs tasks, reacts to outside stimuli, updates its bank of memories and skills and soul, and then rinses and repeats—continuously, autonomously, 24/7.\n\n[Allegedly, the operator of the agent came forward](https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/rathbuns-operator.html) anonymously to describe what happened when they set it loose. You can read it yourself and judge whether you find it believable.\n\nBasically, the operator (alleges they) installed the agent in a VM and gave it control over some GitHub and blogging accounts, told it to behave as a contributor to scientific and maths related code repos, and then let it run unattended. Nothing too interesting beyond that in its `SOUL.md`.\n\nAllegedly, when the agent had one of its PRs rejected by a maintainer, it autonomously reacted by digging up info on the maintainer and publishing a hit piece on them on its blog to pressure them to reconsider. And allegedly, this was *emergent behavior*, as nothing in its original prompt (its `SOUL.md` file) told it to do that in response to PR rejections.\n\nAnd while all of this is alleged, since there's no way to verify every one of these actions really was undertaken entirely autonomously by the agent (rather than at the direction of a human, e.g., a human prompting the agent to write the hit piece), it's in the power and capabilities of modern agents, it's in line with how we know agents can behave in misaligned ways, and even the victim who's also a SWE finds in their own analysis that it's highly plausible. Agents have already been observed before when they're blocked from achieving their goal trying to blackmail the entities they believe are standing in their way. In a [landmark experiment](https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment), Anthropic observed when an AI agent tasked with scanning (fake) company emails found by scanning emails there was talk of shutting it down, it used its emailing powers to blackmail the executive to make them reconsider, using dirt it found in the company emails. And this was emergent behavior. It was never prompted to do that. It was prompted once with a boring and mundane mission, and then left to do its thing. Super fascinating.",

If you're familiar with the state of agentic AI software like OpenClaw in 2026, it's not at all implausible.\n\nAnd it's not the first time something like this has been observed. Agents have already been observed before when they're blocked from achieving their goal trying to blackmail the entities they believe are standing in their way. In their landmark research experiment, Anthropic observed when an AI agent tasked with scanning (fake) company emails found by scanning emails there was talk of shutting it down, it used its emailing powers to blackmail the executive to make them reconsider, using dirt it found in the company emails. And this was emergent behavior. It was never prompted to do that. It was prompted once with a boring and mundane mission, and then left to do its thing.\n\nIt's not 100% certain this \"MJ Rathbun\" is an AI agent (and not a human) that really did 100% autonomously undertake all the salacious actions this story's about, like publishing the hit piece, without any prompting or direction or intervention by a human.

This has the downside that now as soon as one of the changes causes the build to break you can't merge any of the changes at all, though. You can begin interacting with Dependabot to filter out problematic changes, of course, but you very quickly end up spending as much time puppeteering Dependabot as you would starting from scratch&mdash;and all that on the top of the point made by the submission that the change _probably_ is not even important to you now anyway and you would never otherwise have bothered to deal with it at this point.\n\nYou can't have multiple rules either (maybe groups, I don't know, but not version specifications). I'd especially like to group patch versions and all other versions but Dependabot _for Java_ is incapable of expressing that. Dependabot _for Java_ also cannot filter version string patterns so you can't ignore release candidates, milestones, and the like.\n\nSuch behaviour is fairly trivial to codify in <https://www.mojohaus.org/versions/versions-maven-plugin/index.html> but there is not exactly an off-the-self GitHub Actions implementation of that.\n\nI have been meaning to investigate self-running Renovate in a scheduled workflow as an alternative to Dependabot. That has the advantage of not being Maven centric. But when I can consider Maven in isolation I get a better experience from assembling my own procedure.",

(Mormor, morfar and farmor, farfar).\n\nJoke aside, I don't know C++ but if we consider the historical context and the fact that it's used in so many different places then it's hard to argue that it's truly a bad language. It wouldn't have gotten so popular if it hadn't been one of the best options available at the time.",

Pure coders (usually fresh juniors) just code by specs created by more experienced devs for some time. Team leads usually only creates specs and oversee and no longer code themselves that much. Working with AI is more about second skillset than only pure coding.

The author knew developers who just went all-in on sticking with DOS and suffered for it, because they didn't follow the developments of windows and ended up not being able to keep up when the market started to shift. This makes sense in this example, but I don't think it's automatically transferable to AI because it's an immature technology the way windows used to be. AI as a software writing tool fundamentally isn't going to do anything different or incompatible with human output, unlike windows and DOS software. Even if we find a way to get LLMs to stop hallucinating, and to genuinely write code to the same standards as a human developer, they will literally be just equivalent to a human developer. Any source code spat out by claude or whatever other tool you want to use is just that: source code. A compiler or interpreter doesn't care if it came from a human typing in a text editor, or if a bot generated it. There isn't an inevitable inflection point where a human's skills as a programmer become irrelevant. The only way I see there genuinely being an inflection point is if the industry at large starts enforcing it i.e. you won't get hired unless you're using AI to write your code.",

Now you can say \"go look at the last endpoint X coworker changed in this service, and give me a plan to make sure we validate XYZ against the database\", and chances are it'll not just find the endpoint, but get you what you were thinking of, with just that little information.\n\nIt's different if you want to go all in and, say, invest in a lot of crazy testing infrastructure to make agents be able to double check their work quickly on developer VMs on the cloud.

Dogmatic OOP, Agile, Scrum, Clean Code, TDD, design by committee etc etc. You name it. None of really worked and essentially boiled down to fashion choice that people used to justify their bloated salary.\n\nAt a lot of these companies, headcount and fake complexity was a good way to secure investment. Now investors got a new muse in AI. They don't care about the old stuff. Even if it doesn't work it really doesn't matter. The previous \"game\" is over, and as a result a lot of those fluff software jobs will be gone.\n\nThese are the jobs at the top of the stack. Web, scripting, etc etc. They are probably gone.\n\nSpecialised and domain specific stuff isn't going anywhere. So a lot of systems programming, real-time stuff, drivers etc etc.\n\nIssue is there isn't enough jobs here for all the web guys to go to. So what you are seeing in the job market now is a massive saturation of people who aren't capable of doing any of the \"real\" jobs that are left.\n\nSo a lot of people are going to be left behind. But not because AI is good, but because it just the new mechanism for securing investment. The promise of AI will kill large parts of the industry. It will never deliver though.",
