(That is, it is more work to write than to read!) ...  \n\n> If, however, prose is LLM-generated, this social contract becomes ripped up: a reader cannot assume that the writer understands their ideas because they might not so much have read the product of the LLM that they tasked to write it.\n\nThe breaking of a social contract is a very accurate way of describing this, in my opinion. LLM usage can go beyond typical rudeness, they create situations with *epic* levels of time wasted by professionals in similar positions to the curl team.\n\n[0] https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0576",

Arguaby, it might have been quicker to use an LLM to rewrite that component from scratch and then integrate it.\n\nThis has three major implications: \n\n(1) vibe coding has a natural limit, when code complexity has increased so much that forward progress on prototypes even with LLM support stalls because every step breaks as much as it adds\n\n(2) the deferred/maintenance cost of LLM supported coding is tremendous, and as so often in software engineering, the immediate measurable (lines of code/progress # of features) doesn't accurately reflect the total cost (surprise bug trail and much larger maintenance costs)\n\n(3) Experienced software engineers controlling and pushing back against poorly orthogonalized changes from LLM agents have major value in development going forward.

Sounds like marketing and interaction bait to me - after all I had to give them my work email just to read the damn paper. \n\nNadella's numbers about productivity gains certainly are doubtful to some extent, but at least they have real data about the latest GHCP usage and correlation to some loose productivity metrics like Lines of Code or tasks closed.

It's not that I don't care, it's that I only go down the new queue a few times a day. I do remove the things you're talking about, but generally I'm seeing them after they've been up for a few hours. I was traveling over the holidays and pretty busy this weekend and more stuff stayed up than usual, sorry about that.\n\nThe biggest category of posts that I remove is demos (\"I made this\"). After that it's random AI related things that have nothing to do with programming, and after that it's support/forum questions. (That last one may surprise you but if you saw the quality of them you'd understand.) [I wrote more about this here](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chs4ib/the_state_of_the_subreddit_may_2024/) but as you can see it's been some time.\n\nI've really love to get some more mods, but I'm very concerned about finding people that I can trust. Some of the more active users here (which is what reddit's find-a-mod feature uses) are really inappropriate to become mods. I'm not sure what other criteria that I can find to keep it from becoming a drama fest.\n\nI'm not happy with the current situation either, but I'm not sure how to make it better. I'm doing my best. Mods aren't paid by reddit so you're shouting \"I sure wish somebody else would do more free work for my pleasure!\". And honestly I'm with you, I wish there were an easier way to deal with this. But until there is, I'll keep doing my best.",

Employers benefit because throughput goes up. The tradeoff is real though. If someone uses it to avoid thinking or learning, yeah they’ll get worse. Used right, it’s a tool that speeds up parts of the workflow, not autopilot.",

Here is the rant:\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nAs you may notice, this page and pretty much the entire website were obviously created with the help of AI. I wonder how you could tell? Was it a big \"Written With Claude\" badge on every page? I moved it to the top now (with the help of AI of course) to make it even more obvious. There are a few blogposts that were written by me manually, the old-fashioned way, I hope there will be more in the future, and those have a similar \"Human Written\" badge. This project (not the website), on the other hand, is a very, very different story. It took me more than two years of painstaking and unpaid work in my own free time. A story that, hopefully, I will tell someday. But meanwhile, what would you like me to do? To create a complex documentation website with a bunch of highly technical articles with the help of AI and fake it, to give you an illusion that I also did that manually? Like the half of itnernet is doing at this point? How does that makes any sense? Is that even fair to you? Or maybe to create this website manually, the old-fashioned way, just for you? While working a paid job for a salary, most of you wouldn't even get up in the morning. Would you like me to sing you a song while we're at it? For your personal entertainment? Seriously, get a grip. Do you find this information less valuable because of the way this website was created? I give my best to fix it to keep the information as accurate as possible, and I think it is very accurate at this point. If you find some mistakes, inaccurancies or problems, there is a comment section at the bottom of every page, which I also made with the help of the AI. And I woould very much appreciate if you leave your feedback there. Look, I'm just a guy who likes SQL, that's all. If you don't approve of how this website was constructed and the use of AI tools, I suggest closing this page and never wever coming back. And good riddance. And I would ban your access if I could know how. Thank you for your attention to this matter.",

              "text": "Yeah, it wouldn't be terribly hard to build a UDP protocol using OpenSSL with a fast symmetric cipher and a key exchange handshake. If you want to prevent randos from reading your stream that'd probably be fine. Fundamentally you can never really trust the client platform, though. Spending your time trying to build trust into a fundamentally untrustworthy platform will buy you less for your engineering effort than mitigating the possible advantages a user could derive from intercepting that stream.\n\n\nYou can generally assume that given a strong enough financial incentive, people are going to figure out a way to cheat at your game. This isn't just true of video gaming. Casinos are in a never ending arms race and need to mitigate the effects of and detect possible collusion with their staff. See also [Postlegate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stones_Gambling_Hall_cheating_scandal). That one's wild.\n\n\n So your engineering effort is usually better spent mitigating the possible advantages that having access to the streams would confer on the user. Ultima Online had that problem with the introduction of sneaking decades ago -- people would detect you from across the screen and attack you even when you were hidden. They ended up not transmitting hidden players to clients until the server decided the hidden player had been detected. The cheaters could still have faster than human reaction times, but those advantages were not hugely game breaking.\n\n\nIn online poker, even given the best anti-cheat technology in the world someone could still point a camera at a laptop and do image recognition on card faces. So if you want to build a farm of colluding bots, it's not that difficult. An online casino could try to mitigate that by randomizing who you get placed with on a table if they have a big enough pool of players. But if you have a couple dozen (say) systems running bots, you just need to have a couple of them figure out they're sitting at the same table to give yourself an advantage. And that advantage will grow the more bots you have at one table.\n\n\nA few days ago, people were talking about marking their monitor with a sharpie to give themselves an advantage at some FPS or other. Which is why I tend to be suspicious of Esports as a thing unless they're played in a controlled environment with a standardized hardware/software loadout. I suspect part of Blizzard's policy on WoW plug-ins is at least partially an attempt to normalize the environment so that in such a controlled environment a player wouldn't be facing a completely unfamiliar interface. Whenever watching any of the wow streamer channels, their UI looked *nothing* like the stock one Blizzard provided.\n\n\nKnowing all of *that* and being able to convey that information when a user asks about something vaguely related to the ssh protocol being unsuitable as a gaming protocol really highlights the weaknesses in the current round of AIs. At this point the AI has been trained in all of human knowledge, but is incapable of identifying this question as being in the category of \"cheating protection\" and suggesting good places to spend your engineering time to mitigate the impact of cheating. If you follow its advice without thinking about the problem yourself, you might end up building a program that superficially looks pretty secure but doesn't stand up to a thorough analysis by people who have an incentive to do that work. I think the way the world's going now, there will be many opportunities from cheaters because an AI didn't consider lessons learned from the past in its suggested solution. It might be possible to build an AI capable of doing that, but I be it'd be prohibitively expensive to run. Probably more prohibitively expensive than *I* am.",

The top hit if I search for \"ssh sends many more packets than expected\" is the Hacker News discussion about this post.\n\nYou're also wrong about how the project was made - I have written the vast majority of this code by hand. And my blog has years of [detailed technical writing](https://eieio.games/blog/a-million-realtime-chess-boards-in-a-single-process/) on making my games, many of which don't touch on using AI at all.\n\nThis post even mentions that I'm relatively new to using agentic tools and still figuring out how to best use them! I think that is a worthwhile thing to do.\n\nSo idk what to tell you.

An AI (likely) has no idea what specific SSH daemon package you have on your local machine, what operating system you're running, or even whether or not you compiled your SSH daemon from source, omitting or including certain additional features. \n\nThey first explain that SSH added keystroke timing obfuscation in 2023. In [the link they posted](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20230829051257) which explains this functionality, it explains exactly how it is implemented and the new ping/pong extension that it uses. Therefore, if someone were to read that post and actually glean technical meaning from it, their next question would be: Is it possible to disable ping/pong SSH extensions on [my specific version of SSH?]\"\n\nIn their case, now knowing that they're using an SSH server implemented in Go, they could have even just searched the server's source code for the extension names (SSH2_MSG_PING, SSH2_MSG_PONG).\n\nBut instead, we can see the next figure in the blog post is the user immediately reverting back to their Claude prompt, asking  the extremely broad question of: \"Is there any way to disable the chaff server-side?\"\n\nI think the lack of explanation of what version of SSH the server running, lack of clarity that they specifically want to disable the new ping/pong extension, and the generic way they referred to the functionality as \"chaff\" demonstrated that despite AI and/or their research leading them directly to the answer, they failed to parse the technical information they were already provided and instead decided to rely on their AI agent to do the job for them and walk them through it.\n\nI was even more taken aback when I saw their screenshot mentioning \"Claude was also pretty pumped\" about their results, with the most obvious \"AI gassing you up and being your yes-man\" response of all time in the screenshot.\n\nI think the overall flow of their problem solving skills demonstrated in the blog post show an over reliance on AI and a lack of critical thinking skills applied to the project.",

By doing so, the author is denying themselves a valuable learning opportunity to try out and familiarize themselves with common networking and analysis tools (tcpdump, wireshark) that they'll likely use for the rest of their career.\n\n(Caveat: It's possible this is a personal skill issue on my part! I'm not denying that someone could write an insane tcpdump one liner to do network analysis - I just don't personally think someone with the skillset to do would ever choose to waste time on scripting that instead of just viewing raw dumped output/using wireshark - but that is also my bias.

And if I ask an LLM to specify all of that information, I'm essentially just using a search engine again but with more steps.\n\nAI can be useful for providing guidance on generic problems, but it's important to stick to factual documentation and sources of information when dealing with complex technical issues or implementations like SSH. Documentation differs between versions, packages, operating systems, libraries, etc.\n\nAlso, on your point about Google being designed \"to make money for Google\":\n\nGoogle attempts to make a useful product, because if it isn't a useful search engine then users will stop using it. And if there are no users, there will be no one left to look at their ads. In the same way, Claude/ChatGPT/etc. currently attempt to be useful, but just like a Google search, are inherently profit-driven, selling user training data and other analytics.

When we start typing, all the code we are about to type is already in our heads and just has to be typed out. We found, that the prompts needed to get good results were often waaaaay longer than what we were to type directly, which defeated the point of the \"AI\". In the beginning we thought that finally we would have to type less, but in practice this just was not the case. Also, like already stated, the time to read, understand, verify and modify the \"AI\" generated code has to be factored in, which can be significant depending on the topic.",

And then things go downhill really quickly\n\nIf you cannot trust the code to a degree greater than it-compiles, you are not winning anything",

              "text": "See now, this is where I've been for a couple of years now, because it seems like the \"obviously\" correct tact to take.  AI can be great when the person wielding it (a) knows what they're doing on their own anyway, and (b) doesn't trust it absolutely.\n\nBut you know, I'm starting to wonder if that latter part is wrong.\n\nMy thinking... which is ongoing to be clear, I'm not stating a solid position here... is basically to ask the question: when was the last time I reviewed the code that my Java compiler spit out?  When was the last time I went in and tweaked what my C compiler spit out?\n\nAre we treating AI like something more than it needs to be, which in a way is a weird compiler?\n\nPut it this way... if I write some Java code, and compile it, and run it, and it does what I expect, do I care one iota what the bytecode looks like?  Nope, and neither does anyone else.  If I write TypeScript code, and it passes all the tests I wrote for it, do I care what the resultant JavaScript looks like?  Nope, and neither does anyone else.\n\nWell, not until something goes wrong, of course, but I digress :)\n\nMaybe we should be thinking of AI more like a compiler, and our PROMPTS are the source code.  Of course, there's an obvious flaw there: a compiler will spit out the same code from the same source every time (barring version changes or anything like that).  That's definitely not true for an AI.\n\nBut I'm starting to wonder it that really matters?  As long as what I got THIS TIME works, does it matter what  I got LAST time?\n\nAnd what about the argument that AI-generated code is technical debt because eventually you're going to have to touch it yourself.\n\nARE you though?\n\nIf you need a new feature later, you just prompt (and prompt again and again and again and...) until you get what you want.  Oh, there's a bug?  Prompt the AI to fix it.  Oh, it's not quite performant enough?  Prompt the AI to optimize.  As long as the tests still pass, what's the difference?\n\nYour prompts are the source code, the AI is your compiler, whether it's a new feature, a bug, or anything else, why do you care what it actually produces if it works and passes the test?\n\nThis viewpoint bothers me a great deal because it may not be wrong.  Believe me, I've been coding in one form or another for right around 47 years now, professionally for a hair over 30.  And I still enjoy it.  So I don't WANT to NOT code.  But it could it be that \"coding\" is starting to have a different meaning?\n\nMaybe.\n\nAI tends to fall flat on its face if there isn't expertise guiding it.  I've seen people use AI poorly because they don't have the skill to even prompt it properly for what is needed.  You can only go so far with these tools without knowledge and experience to guide it properly.  But man, when you have those things, what you can get out of them IS pretty amazing sometimes... the trick is you have to not look under the covers... and maybe that's okay.\n\nLike I said, it's an evolving thought, and I may well discard it upon further reflection.  But it strikes me as an interesting thought regardless.",

Abstracting stuff to make our jobs easier can be really useful (or useless), \"it doesn't work\" is not a real reason considering your own example proved to be really useful, even if didn't manage to fulfill its original goal (and even that is debatable, considering it is definitely used by non-developers). A similar example of a succesful tool that tried to emulate plain english is Python.\n\nI believe a more productive approach to these kinds of abstractions is asking \"is it worth abstracting?\" and \"how?\".

In contrast, LLMs are processing informal language -- there is no spec, there are no regression tests for it. If someone made a compiler that has tons of amazing features that would make life so much easier in theory, but is also full of subtle miscompilation bugs where it simply cannot be trusted that it will do what you told it to, then most people today wouldn't use it. Yes, it is a matter of trust, but there are real reasons behind that trust. You could as well say \"the only difference between actually solving an equation and rolling the dice is trust\".

But for every task I delegate to it, I'm not really learning (though again, I can't really be dogmatic here because I *do* learn stuff from Claude) and I don't really get to know the system that I'm creating. At work I'm writing in a C++ codebase; I hardly know C++, so AI has written a load of my code. Lo and behold, I shipped a catastrophic C++ bug to production last week (call me names, this is not just my reality; many engineers are doing the same thing). I would *love* for AI to not exist, because then I could really work to become an expert in C++, and it would be understood that this will take time. But because of AI, the assumption is I don't have to do this learning, because an agent can already write the code. So I feel pressured to use AI, even though using it is making me a worse engineer. \n\nIn a way, I think giving up on it entirely is both admirable and sensible. But I worry that if models improve, I'll just end up doing nothing more than raging against the (word-making) machine while others profit from it...",

          "text": "I’ve been working with SharePoint for quite a while and I noticed a few points that may not be fully accurate or at a minimum I had some thoughts about it, and I wanted to share some clarifications that might be useful for you and others in the community.\n\n>**SharePoint Framework is Still Painful**  \nWant to test a change? Package your web part, deploy it to your SharePoint tenant, refresh the page, and hope it worked. The local workbench barely functions for anything beyond trivial examples because it can’t properly mock SharePoint’s APIs. You end up deploying to a dev tenant constantly, and each deploy takes minutes.\n\nThis is not accurate. There is no need to deploy to the tenant every time you make a change. You can work directly in the page and it will automatically refresh as well, without a need of using the Workbench. You can work directly against the APIs.  \n[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/debug-modern-page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/debug-modern-page)\n\n>**The Object Model is Inconsistent**  \nModel), the JSOM (JavaScript Object Model), and the legacy SOAP services. They don’t have feature parity. Some operations are only available in REST, others only in CSOM. Documentation is scattered and often outdated. You spend half your time trying to figure out which API even supports what your trying to do.\n\nI tend to agree with the frustration here. Documentation is certainly hard to find and much of it is out of sync. The only comment I'd make is that you're sort of comparing Apples to Oranges in the blog post when you compare CSOM to REST. Under the covers CSOM is just calling into the APIs anyway, with the exception of server related things on-premises (which should be a given that it's different). The Object Model exists to abstract away some of the nuances of the underlying APIs, and it's expected that they may function differently.\n\n>**Page Rendering Is Slow**  \nThere’s no efficient bundling or lazy loading. Everything gets loaded upfront, whether you need it or not.  \n....  \nThe “modern” pages in SharePoint Online are supposed to be faster, but they’re still noticeably slower than a well-built static site or SPA. \n\nAgain, another area where I'd agree in some aspects,  but disagree in others. The pages are absolutely slow. SharePoint is a huge platform and it is built on decade old APIs that may not be very performant. However, it's a bit unfair to compare it to a static site. Obviously it would never be as fast a static site. In addition, there's context here that is important, which is the sheer amount of ACL's that need to be validated on any given page in SharePoint. It's a platform built on a complex web of hierarchical permissions and many different aspects of the page have to lookup to ACLs to determine whether a specific user has access to it. It's not just a simple web site.\n\nWith that said, I'd also argue about the efficient bundling and lazy loading. This is implemented in Modern SharePoint, both for different aspects of the page (e.g suite bar) and even within the page sections themselves.\n\n>**List Performance Degrades Quickly**  \nThe list view threshold is 5,000 items by default, and if your query exceeds that, SharePoint just refuses to run it. \n\nFor clarity, if your query *returns* more than 5,000 items then the call fails. You mention having a list with 8,000 items and then queries started timing out so you archived the data. Maybe you were in classic, but nowadays moving your data isn't necessary, you would just need to optimize the queries and using paging to return the data, if custom developed. If you're discussing the native experience, the modern experience handles this fine as long the indexes were created accordingly. I have a list with 1.3 million items in it, that I use for demoing this behavior when I speak at conferences.\n\n**Overall Thoughts**  \nFrankly, it was an interesting read and hope my post here doesn't come off as critical. SharePoint is beast of an application and your blog highlights a lot of the short comings of the platform, but at the same time explains the biggest issue with SharePoint. When SharePoint is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. At the end of the blog you summarized it nicely. You got a real application to build? Don't build it on SharePoint. Use Azure SQL, Blazor, etc. SharePoint can be a great platform to do what it's meant to do, the moment you start building large applications, transactional systems, heavily relational data, is when it truly starts to fall down.\n\nAt the end of the day you should use a product for what it's meant and not shove a square peg into a round hole. You hit the nail on the head when you said...\n\n>Stop trying to make SharePoint do everything.",

Personally, I do not see much value in pulling all of that information into your own database when SharePoint is already acting as that database for you. It also does not scale well, and with how quickly permissions and files change, the data is likely out of sync by the time you run a report. A report based on inaccurate data is not very useful.\n\nWhat kind of reports do you really need that go down the file level and permissions across an entire tenant in a view. Given the hierarchical nature of the permissions, and permissions down the files, you're talking about a really significant amount of data.\n\nI find that many reports that Businesses want is already available in Microsoft Purview, or available as part of the Microsoft Purview APIs. \n\nIf you truly need to operate at scale, the best option is Graph Data Connect, which is designed specifically for pulling data from Microsoft 365 and Graph in bulk. Otherwise, you're going to be constantly fighting against the throttling limits. Though if that's the route you're going to go, make sure you're using an App Registration, utilizing the Batch APIs to reduce the # of calls... not much else you can do.",

For instance, a controversial or volatile project with a well defined estimate may shield the team from undue pressure or negative performance review in the event the project falters. \n\nI would also add that it’s better to *forecast* than it would be to use the verb “estimate”. Estimating the cost of materials is quantitative and generally fixed but its much harder to estimate service/labor costs. You don’t know what you don’t know, and you often uncover new information in software work that impacts the costs. In software development, this is more analogous to weather forecasting. We can forecast the costs of this software project based on current conditions, but that forecast is always subject to change as new information emerges.",

          "text": "Good article, but there's a little too much emphasis on accurate estimates being impossible. I think in an experienced team, it's often possible to have useful accuracy.\n\n\nAs an example, at my last job we had a bunch of services based on a framework. We stood up a new service a couple of times a year, and we very often added a new feature to an existing service that required the same pattern of work: add a new DB column, add some business logic around it, add some new methods to the API. Even if the exact business feature was quite different each time, the time to completion was straightforward to estimate.\n\n\nAnd estimates are really important. They allow sales and marketing to do their jobs. They also give important leverage to the engineering team (\"we said it would take three months, and it'll take three months. Stop pressuring us to get it done in two, it's not happening.\")\n\n\nAs for the engineering team, the process of estimating is important because it quickly reveals the degree of certainty attached to all the key elements. When you are being asked to commit to a date, that's often the point where you really pore through the requirements and realize: hey, there's something here that I don't even know how to do yet. We often have a tendency to rush in and begin with the easy parts, the fun parts, the flashy parts, and ignore the fuzzy, ugly, poorly understood parts. Where I work, project estimation is often the first place one is empowered to tell management that the requirements are unclear and must be fixed. THAT happens all the time where I currently work.",

I once told a manager, “How long do you want it to take? We can make the design fit however much you want to invest in this.”\n\nHe didn’t thank me for being agreeable.  He told me -- directly -- that I was trying to sneak out of doing my job. He told me that as Staff Engineer, I didn't have to prove to him that I could find a shortcut. What he needed was for me to tell him how long it should take to do the work properly.\n\nBy offering a \"one-week version\" just because the CTO wants it in a week, we’re often just masking the true cost of the project. Here’s why that’s a problem:\n\nWhen you choose a hacky approach to hit a date, you’re deciding for the company that speed is more important than quality. But that’s a business trade-off that should be made transparently, not hidden inside a clever technical design.\n\nManagers need ammunition, not just \"Yes.\" A good manager wants to know the real cost so they can argue for more time, more people, or to kill the project entirely.  You should always propose the *ideal* system, first, and help your manager understand why building it that way is justified.  Otherwise, you’re leaving your manager high and dry when they actually need to push back on unrealistic demands from above.\n\nTrust isn't just about being easy to work with. OP mentions building a \"well of trust\" by being pragmatic. But real trust is when your manager knows you won't let them accidentally ship a disaster just to hit a deadline.\n\nIf we just hold our finger to the wind to see which way the wind is blowing before we even look at the code, we're not leading— we're just being order-takers with better titles. Our job is to provide the *should*, not just the *how*, even when (especially when) it’s inconvenient.",

The hidden costs need to be made more explicit, maybe even as jokes: \"when this will be done?\", \"tell me first how much you'll pay for maintaining all our for-cycles in the code\". Separate the estimates and reports: when something will be done and when the information about the progress will be available, and make the reports meaningful. To do this use the experience: how does the report and estimate of copying files look like? Nothing, theoretical calculation, hanging on 99% for an hour, saying which files are already copied, specify the number of copied files regardless of their size, specify the size regardless of number of files, say the copy is complete, but it's actually in the cache and might be lost if the device disconnects - plenty of options to consider. The binary-search-like approach and experience actually helps: specify two points \"I'll complete it in 5 minutes\" and \"I'll complete it in 5 years\", both are not realistic, cut the range in half, see which half is more likely contains the realistic estimate, repeat. Negotiation is not forbidden in the estimates: \"we need to complete A in order to retain the customer, their renewal decision is in one month\", \"what if we give them B in two weeks, but A in two months?\". \n\nSir, this is Wendy's.",

Managers have to break down the scope into small enough modules so the engineers can estimate. Things get rough when there is 0 specification apart from 4 sentences from a client and they refuse to pay for discovery and you are competing against 5 other companies trying to get the project. Those kinda projects are really not about your estimates, that's a roll of dice from upper management if they decide to take it.\n\nI can count on one hand how many times I've really fucked estimates (going x2 over budget) and almost all of them was when I was a junior and they were trying to teach me the estimation process.\n\nSadly currently I'm working with people who put x2-3 multipliers themselves then upper management also adds a buffer and the result is that we are twice as expensive as the competition. Surprise, surprise, once I got the task of overlooking estimates and I managed to point out how most of our devs are overestimating by a large margin, we could actually get projects because I'd correct the estimations. I was curious and got permission to not tell the same devs that the actual budget is much smaller yet they managed to finish work 70% of the time within my estimation.\n\nMost of our devs overestimated for 2 reasons: cookie points from the CEO and to slack off at home when calling in sick and \"work\" from home or being remote.\n\nI love remote and I fought multiple times to keep that offer on the table for anyone at the company, but boy, I fucking hate people who will estimate 40 hours for a simple fucking CRUD only so they can finish it in 4 hours or less with AI, then they can jerk off while we are pricing ourselves out of the market.\n\nEDIT: I'd add that what I described is not for corporate jobs or startups with self developed apps. It's related to agency work, which is like probably 80% of SWEs across the world.",

We're pretty used to minority coalitions with some support deal in parliament; we haven't had a single party have majority nationally in this millennium. Party membership has been on the decline for a while, but it's still fairly normal to work with someone who's a member of some political party. Which is to say: Political affiliations are protected information (your employer can't make you disclose it), but discussions aren't taboo, and it's pretty expected that people have varying opinions, rather than having to lump everyone into team red vs team blue.\n* We have pretty strong labour rights and unions, and are pretty habituated to the [tripartite cooperation](https://snl.no/trepartssamarbeid) of labour unions, employer unions and the government.\n* We like to think we have a pretty flat hierarchy, where it's expected that you're able to contradict and argue with your boss in meetings.\n* (We also don't really have words like \"sir\" or \"madam\" in our language any more; those fell out of use, oh, around a century ago?)\n\nSo for us I'd kind of expect a labour union like [Tekna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekna_(Norway\\)) or [NITO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Society_of_Engineers_and_Technologists) to be involved in having the backs of employees, but also in informing employees in what's expected to be acceptable and what's not.\n\nThat doesn't mean that everything is sunshine and butterflies, but we might be a bit more predisposed to the idea that employees can and will push back on the stuff their employers want.\n\n> The real question the paper doesn't answer: who's going to pay for quality information if not advertisers?\n\nAt least here in Norway I'd expect tax money to  be a part of the discussion, in a way that'd probably be … somewhat contentious over in Silicon Valley.

I don't know what you really mean when you say \"democratic\" here. On one hand, you might be referring to \"software being for everyone\", but then you are perhaps unwittingly mixing in related concepts that are unrelated to software. What makes something \"unethical software\", exactly? It reads to be very vague and arbitrarily, unfortunately, without specific definitions of what you actually mean.\n\nAnd talking about specifics, I think the only unethical stuff in relation to open-source software is proprietary software, pseudo-open source (think shared source where you can see the code, but aren't allowed to do anything with it), and LLM-generated slop that is currently inundating open source project merge request and issue boards ~ slop that might have been derived from LLMs training on proprietary code, for one.",

You envision something, implement it and feel great when the whole thing starts working and always have a sense of learning and accomplishment! I shifted into SWE because I passionately loved coding and how code all works together in some architecture.\n\nOn the other hand, *reading* existing code in order to understand it and find bugs - especially if it's subpar LLM-generated AI slop - is a boring chore compared to the joys of writing it. It's unfulfilling, mentally taxing and it's easy to miss important things.\n\nIt's not fun! I'm often guilty of procrastinating PR reviews. Who *enjoys* reviewing a hundreds line long PR?!\n\nLLMs shift engineering activity away from writing code towards reading code i.e. they take away the fun parts and introduce more of the unfun parts. They also lessen the human discussion and connection part and instead we're mindlessly chatting with a machine all day. \n\nHeck, they even degrade our thinking - at least with web search, we've had to make the final decision about a piece of information or adapt some solution to fit our problem. Now, we're spoon-fed with generative solutions that may or may not work.\n\nI like programming computers but I don't like outsourcing my thinking to probabilistic black boxes and labeling *that* as \"productivity\". I don't like the most fun parts being taken away from this profession.\n\nOf course, many folks just treat code as a means to an end already. They may be good engineers who just don't like coding as much. Or they are managers, CTOs etc. who may have liked coding before but don't have the time for it any more. For them, it's totally understandable that whipping out Claude Code in order to create something between two meetings can be amazingly fun. But not for me!\n\nI'm not sure where all this will go but maybe I need some exit plan out of this profession even though I have achieved quite much. I already barely tolerate the pressure from AI hype, the anxiety that it causes and the burnout that it may bring.",

I took joy in my job as a freelancer crafting applications that in some cases have been running for almost twenty years now and that have remained easily extended and updated.

One observes these self-anointed \"developers,\" though their title is a garment ill-fitting and stolen, who profess to build digital kingdoms while possessing little more than the whimsical \"vibe\" of an architect.\n\nThey are the artistic equivalent of one who, with a grandiose flourish, commands a machine to produce a masterpiece, then has the gall to press their seal upon the canvas and proclaim themselves a painter of the old masters' lineage. The effort lies not in the mixing of pigments, the understanding of light, or the stroke of the brush, but merely in the utterance of a fashionable incantation.\n\nTheir code is not architected; it is wished into existence, a precarious tower of incantations copied from distant scrolls, held together by hope and the toil of the libraries they do not comprehend. They speak in vagaries of \"energy\" and \"flow,\" mistaking the absence of rigour for the presence of genius, and believe that debugging is a spiritual journey rather than a disciplined exercise in logic.\n\nLet it be known: to manipulate the very logic of machines, to command the silicon with precision, is a pursuit worthy of the title Developer. It is a vocation of structure, of relentless reason, of building with materials one thoroughly understands. What these \"vibe coders\" practice is not development; it is digital dabbling. They are not builders of empires, but mere decorators of rented rooms, blind to the foundations beneath their feet and doomed to bewilderment when the walls—as they inevitably must—begin to crack.\n\nThe court of genuine achievement has no throne for such hollow pretension. They may play at creation, but they reside in the gallery of consumers, mistaking the act of curation for the sweat of genesis. A most tiresome and decadent trend, indeed.",

Perhaps it is possible to build tools to help with producing and evaluating formal specifications. Perhaps we could move towards reducing incidental complexity from our systems in a way that would make it possible for mathematical reasoning to scale better.\n\nMy main point is that theorem provers could eliminate the core flaw of llms to be unreliable and hallucinate and that both technologies are only at the start of their development.",

When enough people vote for the end of democracy, then so be it. Any political system can be changed to another at the will of those in control of it. Democracy is not any different.\n\nPersonally, I'm a firm believer in democracy, and it makes me sad seeing change to a different system, but then again this project is not controlling anything in our lives, so the point is that people are just trolling with that and see this as entertainment.\n\nIt's a rather long shot to relate this to a political system. In addition voting is often only the most interactive aspect of a democracy. But to reduce a democracy to just voting is a simplification. There are political systems that let people vote, but that's it. A strong political democracy has free press, separation of powers, rule of law, active participation, and fundamental rights and equality *in addition* to voting. A political system where people cannot choose *what to vote on* is not a democracy.",

I was working at a natural language processing company at that time, and it's relatively common in NLP stuff to download dumps of Wikipedia page texts to use for training purposes, since Wikipedia has a large amount of text in a lot of different languages, and conveniently packages up dumps of all of its content every night. Someone I worked with at the time made a post on Twitter about how this Scots Wikipedia thing exposed a major issue with using Wikipedia (and internet data at large) for these kinds of purposes.

Which as an IC are basically out of your control. I chased those things as a way to survive the upcoming layoffs, and when I was laid off anyway (along with almost all of my org) it hit me hard. I took that to the next job, and when I came across a bad manager who belittled my contributions while I was trying hard to get influence and impact it broke me. I got laid off again.\n\nNow after some reflections I realise that layoffs happen no matter how hard you try. Attempting to impress people and chase influence and impact is not a worthy goal. Just do the best you can and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nI think the most dangerous thing about performance reviews is that it makes you feel like your compensation and levelling is down to your work quality. As you mentioned in the article, it is more down to politics.",

We have X to distribute in bonuses, Y in raises, and we have A B C D promotions available for the various levels. \n\nStarting at the top of the org chart pyramid and flowing to the bottom, each manager has to decide how to split this pool. Who gets more and who gets less. \n\nCovid times was weird as hell because for a couple years there the budgets really ballooned, especially at a lot of the top tier companies. Then suddenly, cutbacks. Layoffs if you were unlucky. So now managers have to tell employees, you did an amazing job this year, best I can do for you is a shit raise, because the company is tightening its belt. Some people take this in stride, some people quit for more pay elsewhere or politely threaten to do so, some people take this really personally. \n\nIt's also one of the reasons that a team of equal level people can bite you - you have four up from promo but your team gets at most two. What to do? If they're all junior, they need promotions soon else it's an obvious sign to quit; if they're senior they expect longer times between promos and are generally less likely to quit but if they do the impact is more severe. \n\nA company doesn't need to stack rank for comparisons between employees and limited resources afforded by the beancounters and execs to be somewhat painful. \n\nIn ye olde mythical times you could just trust the company management understands all this and will take care of you. Unsure exactly how much that was real vs rosy tinted glasses. Today people get really antsy immediately for good reasons, a missed promo could be a sign of an impending pip/layoff/fire.",

Some are just more open to spending than others. And as soon as a salesperson leaves there is a huge political mess about what to do with their accounts. You might be doing well - you just signed a 500k uplift with a customer and are well on track to hit your number for the year. Then Mike leaves the company and you get one of his accounts. On paper they look good - 2 million ARR, but they emailed Mike before he left that they were planning to spend 1 million less this year, and Mike never updated his Salesforce notes to reflect this. You get the account and it’s less than 2 months before the renewal. Suddenly you’re 500k in the hole through no fault of your own.",

You'll find that in the whole of your experience, never once did you witness compensation or promotional criteria actually try to arrive at a very simple truth: what is the current and future financial impact of this person's work.  You'll find that this is severely downplayed even when the financial impact is clear and undeniable.  At large tech companies, it's almost commonplace for people to fix bugs or implement performance optimizations that recover *millions* in lost revenue.  \n\nThe whole performance review process exists *solely* to stop people from talking about money.  Or the most obvious fact about money: that the total compensation is always less than the total benefit.  The compensation budget gets set *in advance*, before the performance review cycle even begins.  It's all a distraction to get workers to squabble over the scraps that had been thrown their way.  It does not and cannot reflect reality.\n\n> Companies are still fundamentally hierarchical. We haven’t found a better way to run them — or at least, we haven’t seriously tried. \n\nOn the contrary!  If we just *stopped trying*, for once, things would instantly get better.  There is a large body of scientific and business literature and studies that consistently show the same thing: performance reviews are harmful.  Just stop doing them!  \n\nThe anecdote from your time in Moscow is a case in point: there was no process, but when they discovered someone had been underpaid for 2 years, they gave her backpay.  See?  Already, that's better.  \n\nI'm old enough to have worked at tech companies *before* they started performance review cycles.  It was glorious.  If you wanted a promotion or a raise, you would walk into your manager's office and demand one.  Money was discussed *openly*, with client contracts and sales figures being transparently available to everyone who was working on them.  The way you had \"impact\" was by making sure you worked on the projects with the largest upside while spending the least amount of time on the ones that were underwater.  Very simple.  When negotiating, everything was on the table - salary, vacation days, choice of projects, even all-expense paid trips for your family to join you on business trips.  One year I flew out to Colorado to manage one of their engineering teams for the summer and in exchange I got to live in a mountain cabin with my girlfriend on the company dime - all expenses paid. \n\nThere was only one time when I found that performance reviews were useful: when I didn't have to participate.  I just walked into my manager's office one day and he said, \"good news, you're getting a promotion and a pay raise\".  And even then, that was the *only* good part about it.  As soon as I got to the point where I wanted the next promotion and pay increase that I thought I was due, then suddenly all the bullshit started to matter.  So I had no choice but to quit and get what I wanted from somewhere else.\n\nBut it's been downhill from there. *It is* a wage suppression scheme.",

          "text": "My main lessons with performance reviews is the two key things are,\n\n  \n1. Perceived impact: Not the same as actual impact. Emails that announce your work launching, design documents/reviews, who talks about it are all very important. Two projects that save same amount of money/equal engagement gains will often have very different perceived impact based on how they are communicated. A big part of this is also just focusing your work to align with your manager/skip manager/even higher up as possible.\n\n2. Relationships with people above you: The higher the better. My current company even requires your promotion performance reviews come from people at your target level or higher. You want to promote for senior? Then ideally have multiple staff/senior staff/etc engineers and managers that support you. Having only senior reviewers is technically enough but your chances improve heavily the higher level your support comes from.\n\n\n\nFor 2 one thing I did early on as a junior engineer was \\~2 times a month schedule a casual 1 on 1 with people from teams/departments mine collaborated with to learn more about their work. While that was not done for the purpose of promotion, in retrospect forming a lot of good relationships with senior/staff engineers as a junior helped heavily. I still sometimes do it now (much less though) and now I do consider what level someone is. Just having people high up being aware of your work and include you in future discussions is very helpful.\n\n  \nPart of number 2 is also just the image you end up building. If you are viewed as reliable/fast/etc engineer year 1 then later on if your performance slows down often your earlier image will heavily continue to bias your new reviews and be excused in some way.",

          "text": "I mean it's a challenging notion. The first problem, I'd argue, is that there's no objective or reasonable way to measure individual performance. Because so much of the performance of an individual is respective to transient situations and the team you're in.\n\nSay we have a new staff engineer, they've got chops and history, but the company is in a dire position and they are struggling. If they go to team A they'll be thrown some starter projects but have those changed around. Mostly due to the massive reorgs the company is going due to the dire position. Then they'll be thrown around to different teams that work on disparate situations and struggle with different parts of the infrastructure. Our engineer now has worked on radically different platforms, but has never really spent more than 6 months on any team. After 2 years the engineer has done solid job, but more on a senior, not staff level, so they do badly on reviews. The engineer also now struggles to catch up and get something in.\n\nSay we had the same staff engineer, but this time joined a team B where there was a principal engineer involved. As chaos from the reorg happens, the principal takes the new eng under his wing and with a director, they want to create a \"strike\" team that will focus ~40-60% of their time to a specific goal that is important for the company, even as the reorg happens (this is why the strike team, it's meant to be decoupled from the reorg and therefore have a consistent approach. You are not the strongest engineer the principal could take, but the principal engineer sees that the new eng has the potential they just haven't had the opportunity to gain expertise in an area, and they believe that the staff can totally take over this project once things settle down, and the other engineers, though their expertise with the company and its systems can ramp up more quickly, they also would benefit the teams during the reorg more. So this staff engineer now spends ~9 months on this project, and naturally becomes the lead (he's switched to other projects, but they mostly help with the firefighting, paying down the tech debt from the reorg, and then are moved on to another team). After the whole thing the engineer now has grown confidence in his area and helps create a new team for the project that the strike force handled, and is made the tech lead of this team, as the principal has moved on to other projects. Now during after 2 years they have helped a multitude of teams and gained a lot of networking and wide knowledge, but also have pushed and lead critical systems in the company: exactly what you'd expect of a very solid to strong staff engineer.\n\nThe same engineer, the same company, but the difference was just one person that understood how to get their potential out, and not let circumstances hamper the productivity of that engineer. It can be many other variations: access to a mentor or someone who is willing to sit and teach, a manager who understands how to excite you (or at the very least knows how to express feedback and weakness in an actionable manner), a tech lead that has a similar philosophy on software and things with the team just \"click\", or a mix of all of this, or maybe a team that has just the right mix of meetings to avoid thrashing but keep the eng focused through their ADHD. A good chunk of the effective productivity of an engineer is affected by the people around them. This is why we pay manager and middle management so well, this is why staff+ engineers are all about how they work with others: jobs whose effect is increasing the impact/productivity of ICs are huge benefits.\n\nSo we can measure the productivity at team level relatively well, but it's hard to do it at individual level. Any system that purports to be able to measure this directly on the individual is bound to have parts of it that are arbitrarily defined and hand-waved away based on what is convenient. This gives us different pros and cons. In some companies you lose a lot of amazing engineers because they move elsewhere once they are good enough, because you can't recognize them. In some companies you'd have to lose tens of solid engineers while a team struggles for years before realizing it was a management issue. In some companies there's a lot of people who just have no idea what to do and require an insane unjustifiable investment to become productive enough but you can't justify getting rid of them either.",

              "text": "So how do we track individuals? The answer is complicated, but there is a way. Ironically the easier problem to solve is, IMHO, promotions:\n\n* New grad to Junior: just meet expectations for a couple of years, if you are still in New Grad level and are more than X years after you graduated, this should be a moment to bring up an intervention with possible firing. There's a chance that the training and education you need just can't be given at the company, and extending your time stuck in that fresh-outta-school mentality is going to be far more harmful to your range. A successful intervention should basically finish in the guy getting a promotion to junior. A recommendation to go into other spaces (consulting can be brutal but it's great at teaching and forming solid programmers).\n* Junior to Mid: it's about a checklist of skills. Basically you need to have done X amount of projects, covered X amount of things, used X amount of technologies. Basically you need to do what a solid engineer can do and understand a variety of things beyond \"just coding\". You need to be able to get peers to review you positively (like asking for a recommendation, or a peer review) on those projects and about those skills.\n* Mid to Senior: the full checklist, with some advanced work (e.g. supported software that was long-lived, has worked with legacy code, etc.) that's important for the knowledge. At this point you are considered a strong engineer who can do anything that's expected of an engineer and do it well. You also show you know how to work well on a team and understand how to mentor, lead technical design, etc. As in many tech companies (though that may be changing thanks to AI) this is the level you are expected to eventually get to. If you are unable to get a promotion above this it shouldn't be held above you: projects in the staff+ land are rarer, and proving your performance beyond this level is messy.\n* Senior to Staff: This is where we start actually looking at performance. The goal is to show you can interact in variety of projects, with a variety of teams, and yet in all these environments you show a consistent impact. That is you can notice that teams you join have an increase in productivity and impact consistently, and projects you lead tend to be core part of that. If the effect remains after you leave this may actually be a stronger signal of you being staff level. Basically show this in enough environments that you have to start to consider that it'd be a statistical anomaly that it wasn't something unique to you specifically. With this you prove you have a multiplicative effect, and are a highly useful and powerful engineer to pass around teams, and to start thinking on the level beyond teams.\n* Going to Staff+ positions is just about staff but with even more.. Not just show you work well in different teams, but different problem spaces, different areas of the company, different software, and about how well your leadership and mesh with leadership is. This becomes more like the promotions of VPs and onwards, a more political and subtle thing.\n\nThat's great. So what about performance? First of all lets understand the problem with stack-ranking, and in many companies calibration is really stack-ranking behind the scenes. The idea is that employees over a large enough group should distribute normally, and by having the managers discuss over all of these employees they can rank the employees accordingly. If you really wanted an objective measurable way, you would use perf-packets reviewed by a performance committee of managers who were unrelated to the employees being reviewed. Your manager would be on a pref-committee for other engineers. The perf-packet would be made by the employee and manager and make the arguments and data for it. Like the inputs you give to the Roblox algorithm, but it's a committee of humans, and you can appeal a review with another committee.\n\nBut either way this doesn't solve shit either, because of the core problem the article put forward: there's limited budgets to distribute. And how do you distribute them. While we know that stack ranking doesn't work, no one every discussed why. The answer is simple: we assume a normal curve, but who the hell said that's the case? It could just as well be an exponential curve (it is intuitive that the time an engineer has been at the company follows an exponential distribution, it is also intuitive that amount of time an engineer needs to get to a skill level is also an exponential distribution, does this mean that performance is non-normal? No it might be normal, but the point is to make a reasonable case that maybe it isn't). The second issue is what I've said: we track teams, not members.\n\nSo instead lets measure the performance of teams first. We can do a nice, objective system, where a report of what was done is made, and it's measured by managers unrelated to the team into some value. Now we rank the teams in simple terms: it's meeting the expectation, surpassing them, or failing to reach them. We can compare areas of the companies as well by using a Mann-Whitney U-Test to compare how different products compare in efficiency. This is just an interesting number to see how it compares to the profits of that product, but sometimes your cash-cow isn't what needs the most money (it's resilient and working well) and instead the focus should be on the bleeding edge where you're finding new growth opportunities. This info can be used to measure.",

                  "text": "Now what about bad performance? Well lets start with the individual: when an engineer is working badly within a team, or not satisfying them, they are transferred to a new team, with no information about why they looked for an internal transfer shared with the team (that said they may need to pass the internal interview and all that, and if they fail they lose the job). This isn't spreading bad employees around, it's acknowledging that context and situation may matter. If you fail consistently and have other people not wanting to work with you, then an intervention is set up, with a high chance that it'll result in you losing the job. This might seem expensive, but given how long a mediocre employee can remain in the job, it honestly isn't, and teams have an easier time just asking to trade someone for another person, rather than having to set up the firing. The firing happens at a higher level than your direct EM, it requires that multiple EMs are unhappy with you on their different teams, throughout different moments of the employee's life (so it wasn't just a couple bad days, but months).\n\nWith teams with bad performance a similar thing is done. An intervention is done to understand what is happening with the team. There's an order of magnitude less teams than employees (almost by tautological definition) so more effort can be put at scrutinizing the performance. If the issue seems transient, the team is given a second chance to recover. If the issue seems that the team is oversized or under-sized for the projects it handles (i.e. the team's actually able to do everything it wants super quickly, but there simply isn't that much to do as the product has reached a certain level of maturity where the focus is to keep things stable and do incremental improvements there just aren't that many goals to achieve, or alternatively the team struggles to do most of its goals because it's overwhelmed with work) the headcount is reassessed. If the team seems to have engineering issues, weak engineers are transferred to other teams (as per the bad individual performance test above) and you bring in a staff+ engineer to see if they can help change the team to something better. If the problem seems to be mismanagement, then you handle the EM as you would with a bad individual performance issue above. Of course there may be bigger issues at director level and what not, but these are easy to measure, we can rank multi-team leads by doing U-Test between their teams, without the issues of the above. That said, even there you probably want to run some experiments: strong directors may take on more teams/products, while weaker directors may cede some of their teams, until we reach a level. Ideally directors will need to be able to increase the number of teams to advance up the ladder, as they need to show they have a consistently positive benefit over a large enough group of people.\n\nSo what about strong individuals? They'll get their projects and what not that help them get the promotions and to staff quickly enough. Having a patron would also help getting these projects, that hasn't changed.\n\nAnd I agree with the author here: the goal shouldn't be fairness. It should be humanity + alignment. Alignment is the goal for the company: the whole point is that employees give them the most value for their salary, and the benefit to the employee is that they realize what work they do not need to do and can focus on what will actually get them paid more. Humanity is the necessary part for the process to work with the employees. The answer is to be predictable, transparent and candid on the whole thing. Let employees be able to see a calibration/rating meeting, have things be transparent, and be honest about the strengths and weaknesses. Admit that the goal isn't to be a perfect meritocracy, but to reward employees who do the best they can for the company. Be candid in your feedback on how to improve, and be candid on how to 'cheat' the system (e.g. the easiest way to get a great score is to show you generated $X amount of profit for the company that year, where $X is notably larger than what you cost the company) because it isn't cheating the system: it's aligning with the company values (now those may have their own issue, but that's a separate problem). And be clear that there's limited budgets and they're being distributed among all the employees. Maybe a year the profits are 3x and the budget 2x, but the number of employees is now 5x, let the engineers do the math. Treat your employees as adults and trust that they are big boys who understand that this is a business and a job, not a hobby club. And do this making it clear to the employee that you expect the employees to work for their own best interest within the system, and that you want them to succeed because that means they made you, the employer, succeed as well.\n\nThen listen to the feedback: why do employees not like the system. Why do they find it broken? When does it not reward them for doing what the company wants them to do? When does it punish them for it? What are the issues that employees are having? While the system I have may seem extreme, the idea is that you only need peer reviews while building towards senior promotions, but not for normal perf.\n\nAnd this isn't perfect. Lotta details missing on how to not make this take 40% of your eng-hrs and manager-hrs every year. How to make it easy to understand, etc.",

          "text": "I’ve had employers/bosses before use the performance review not so much to review me (and my work) but their general frustrations at the company (and life), and then rate me as a poor performer.  Two cases come to my mind:\n\n1. Early job.  My boss came out of a nasty 4 hour support call, but still needed to give me a year-end review before I went on vacation.  He was not in a good mood.  He spent the next two hours going beyond every detail to nitpick things from my first couple of weeks.  He started complaining about my lunch choices.  He even believed some (obvious) lies from his favorite self-appointed-second-in-command, which was the only time I raised my voice back at him.  I still have some lasting trauma from the place.  Years later I’ve learned about narcissistic abuse only to come to the conclusion that this man was an A+ P.o.S.\n2. Not so early job.  I was working for an unstable company that had three CEOs in the span of 12 months.  Product was not built properly from the start (before my time), but we were making headway.  Halfway through my (good) boss ran off to China and was replaced with a “Rockstar” programmer.  Biggest P.o.S. I ever worked for (like AAA+).  Issues included constantly complaining and belittling others behind their back, constantly yelling/asking me “Why did <person> do this?” When there were things done way before my time.  I also suspect he was having a failing marriage because he was constantly telling me about his wife hates him.  As for my performance review, he used it more as a session to complain about things at the company, and even admitted that he couldn’t accurately rate me but still wanted to give me poor marks.  I did try to confront him about this, but when I spoke up an told him that his review was “not fair an accurate” the first thing he shouted to me was “is this about the bonus”?  When we got the product done (and ready for regulator approval) most of us in product development were laid off, except for him.  I believe management wanted to keep him on to clean software things up.  I later found out that he rage quit the company a few weeks later.  But what’s interesting is that he lists himself as working at the company for 5 months longer than his quit date (didn’t want to make it look like he was only there for 7 months).  Somehow he was able to be “Director of Software Engineering” at two companies, at the same time (I think he was lying).\n\n---\n\nI never said anything at the time because I was afraid of losing my job and that these companies were small and didn’t have an HR department.  Don’t stand for abuse and call it out.  I wish I had a time machine to go back and convince my former self to call these people abusive to their faces in the moment.",

Each time they it I immediately see how arbitrary they can be (scoring by issue count was an idea… also just effort pointing EVERYTHING was brought up which was so stupid).\n\nWhat I found in the above product was something that leveraged LLMs to try and pull in the complexity of the output into account by directly measuring via a variety of integrations, and adding scores based on a matrix. As an LLM skeptic I was pleasantly surprised by how it worked, maybe far too from perfect but far better and more thorough than any human could realistically pull off.\n\nI think LLMs hold the key in help orgs better understand the real performance of their engineers, the ability to push huge amounts of information continuously through them (down to code diffs in pull requests, comments made in various collaborative systems), combine those things, and score based on what are inherently qualitative metrics to give us discussion points to work with is a perfect use case for them.",

But the root problem isn’t boundaries themselves, it’s a cultural failure to imagine failure modes and communicate integration contracts clearly.\n\nThat’s why treating “boundaries = danger” as the lesson is risky. It can lead to the wrong conclusion: “avoid boundaries, have one team do everything.” That just hides the problem until the system gets too big to hold in one person’s head.\n\nWhat works is being explicit at the boundary: agree on shared terminology (and avoid loaded jargon), surface assumptions, and write down the minimal invariants the integration depends on (units, power source, interface expectations, tolerances, etc.). Working from invariants makes “boring” failures like unit mismatches much harder to miss, because you stop reasoning about what the other engineer surely knows and start reasoning about what must be true for the integration not to fail. That’s why “failure to communicate” is usually “failure to predict edge cases”, especially the stupid, mundane ones we assume would never happen (like pounds vs newtons mismatch).\n\nStarting from invariants moves you from “we missed obvious edge cases” to the much more respectable problem of “we weren’t perfect at predicting genuinely intricate edge cases.”",

There are libraries to provide this sort of functionality, but they're not standard, and they're not ubiquitous and used by every engineer.\n\nIf I'm looking at some metric and I see a field called `latency` of type `double` -- what unit is it? Depending on the system, I have seen seconds, milliseconds, and nanoseconds. Sure, you could call it `latency_ms` -- but why not just have `latency` be of type `duration`?\n\nWhen dealing with currency transactions, you'll usually see one of two things. It's some language-specific form of decimal, or it's an integer value of the smallest denomination. So either $5 == €5 == ¥5 == ₩5 (which is very wrong) or US¢500 == EU¢500 == ¥500 == ₩500 (which is a lot closer but still very wrong). Why not have a first-class currency datatype that allows you to know that $5.00 > $3.00 but will error out if you try to check $5.00 > ¥300 unless you explicitly convert with an exchange rate?\n\nFor that matter, the type system could even deny you the ability to divide a currency value by a scalar, a huge potential source of bugs, and instead offer multiple methods depending on the context. Like splitting an amount into shares, honoring things like rounding rules and minimum coin sizes, so that the results are guaranteed to add up to the original amount and no Superman 3/Office Space chicanery can happen.\n\nAnd the very existence of a first-class currency type in the standard library would discourage inexperienced developers from trying to use floating-point values for currency.",

These two may wrap the same type (a `long`), but if you tried to use one in place of the other (e.g. after a merge conflict or something), the compiler will error out.\n\nThe best part is that this concept doesn't need any special support from the language, just a somewhat sane typesystem. For example, [libraries for Java](https://github.com/tguzik/valueclasses) focus on just the convenience around the core concept, not the foundations.",

A common issue is \"death by a thousand cuts\" - a bunch of *small* inefficiencies add up and are almost impossible to profile as they just appear as noise.\n2. When you have tasks indirectly dependant on other tasks, it can be very unclear where optimizations actually can help. I have a sprite resampling mod for a game. The hashing algorithm is pretty quick, but speeding it up even more still helps the game's render thread keep going, but it also helps keep data getting pushed to the worker threads so that they actually have things to do. A marginal improvement in performance results in a lot of tasks getting done sooner and reduces latency.\n\nAlso noting that measuring (except if you're using very specific tools) won't always tell you what's *actually* causing the slowdown, only what's being slow. Aside from the macro cases of awaiting something else (like IO), this applies to things like cache invalidations (usually due to false sharing or not using non-temporal access where appropriate). The thing *causing* the slowdown is hidden in the profile - what it's made slow is what pops up.",

Depending on what you want to actually use the measurements for, different metrics offer different benefits. I wrote about that [here](https://modulovalue.com/blog/statistical-methods-for-reliable-benchmarks/#different-metrics-for-different-questions): \n\n* **Fastest (minimum)**: \"How fast can this code run?\" An existence proof of capability. Best for comparing pure algorithms where you want to isolate the code from system noise.\n* **Median**: \"How fast does this code typically run?\" Robust against outliers. Best for understanding typical performance under normal conditions.\n* **Mean (average)**: \"What is the total time cost?\" Essential for capacity planning and throughput calculations where every millisecond counts toward the total.\n\nThere's also the question of which tools one should use. I used standard file IO library that Dart comes with, but I also tried reimplementing it via FFI and It was only a few percent faster so that was a waste of time. One person linked to a blogpost about [Off-CPU Flame Graphs](https://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/offcpuflamegraphs.html) and I think it would be nice to have better tooling in those areas that make it easier to collect data that we can then derive metrics from.",

The bottleneck was really per-file overhead: the accumulated cost of 300,000+ syscalls, filesystem metadata lookups, inode resolution, and directory traversal. The SSD itself was capable of 5-7 GB/s but I was getting 80 MB/s, not because the storage was slow, but because of everything that happens between \"read this file\" and actually getting the bytes.\n\nOne of the commenters (ori\\_b) made a similar point: the user/kernel context switch itself is maybe 50ns on modern hardware, so 300,000 switches only account for about 2% of the 14.5 seconds. The rest is the work happening inside each syscall: filesystem metadata lookups, dentry resolution, random access latency on NVMe (\\~50-100us per read). So \"syscall overhead\" is also slightly misleading. \"Per-file overhead\" is probably the most accurate framing.\n\nI updated the post with an addendum covering this distinction, but you're right that the title could do a better job. The core finding is that going from 104,000 individual file opens to 1,351 archive reads eliminated most of that per-file overhead, giving a 43x I/O improvement. Whether you call that \"I/O\" or \"the boundary between user and kernel space\" or \"per-file overhead\" is partly semantic, but precision matters and the title is sloppy about it.",

What and how to comment when you can't trivially pull up API docs on hover, but also can't collapse novella-length rambles matters far more.\n\nIt makes me wish more automatic formatters had support for half-indents, though: Gives labels/case statements a wonderfully-skimmable silhouette, and can make it trivial to distinguish a wrapped line from a block when using same-line opening braces, among other, more subjective, uses.",

I've known people who kind of straddle the fence between management and tech leadership struggle with not making that space. But it can work even if it feels kind of rare. I do connect with the whole \"skin in the game\" idea.",

Do you have on-calls that you as the manager participate in too? \nOtherwise it is not much of the skin... \n\nWhat's more important though is this: do you oversee the salaries in the team? If so, how do you know that the team is not biased towards your solution/tasks done? \nMeaning they are less likely to question you or stand against you.\n\nSorry, I've never seen \"coding EM\" being a healthy thing.",
