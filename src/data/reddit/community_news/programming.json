All these numbers sound crazy, but you have to remember that all the AI services are heavily subsidized, so you have to 2x or maybe 3x the cost of this \"browser\" built \"fully autonomously\" to see the real cost. So 140~210 million dollars for a repo that doesn't build?",

I asked it to do some stuff, it automatically modified the code and said \"I'm done.\" But when I tried to compiler it, it didn't compile.\n\n\nSo I told it that, and gave it the compiler output, and it figured out the problem and fixed it.\n\n\nSo I thought, if it can figure out the problem given the compiler output, why can't it just try to compile it itself and check the output, and keep going until it can successfully compile and run the program? And given this instruction, it actually did it.\n\n\nNow, you might say \"maybe it can get the program to compile, but is it doing the right thing?\" So let me tell you another anecdote.\n\n\nI gave it a quite simple task of implementing one of our tickets, basically just a counter keeping track of something. But after it had updated the code and added checks of the counter in the tests, I noticed an obvious bug: In some of the tests, the counter ended up negative.\n\n\nSo I told Amazon Q this, and nothing more - there is a bug somewhere, because this counter should never go negative. And Amazon Q responded with \"I understand, the problem is that your requirement said X but what you actually want is Y\".\n\n\nIt basically told me that it hadn't made a mistake, it had followed the requirements correctly but the requirements it had been given didn't match what we actually wanted. And of course it also updated the code to do what I actually wanted.\n\n\nUp until this week, I was extremely skeptical about AI.\n\n\nBut Amazon Q is turning me into a believer.",

The information was encrypted and our job was to find the key by optimizing provided C code that would normally take years to finish, with no further information provided.\n\nReading the code made it immediately clear to me that they were computing the area of a huge circle in the most inefficient way imaginable, so I just replaced that code with the regular circle area formula, computed the result as an approximate floating-point number in a single operation, converted it to an integer, and then interleaved incremental additions and subtractions to brute-force the key until the decrypted result contained something resembling an E-mail address, at which point the exact value was found and the challenge was cleared.\n\nOnce I found the address I just E-mailed them the code and results, which ran so fast on my own computer that just a naive `times` command just returned 0.0 for all system, user, and real time values on Linux. They weren't expecting that solution, said that the fastest version they had internally took 0.3 seconds to run on their systems, and in the end I just told them that I wasn't really interested in the job because it was way too far away from home but found the challenge interesting and definitely uncommon. I never got to read their internal solution so up to this day I haven't figured out exactly what their own train of thought actually was, or even whether they intended the problem to be interpreted as just finding the area of a circle, but that's how I inferred the problem from the provided code and that was the optimal solution that I found.",

It can still be useful, even with its flaws.\n\nFor example, this test runs a higher chance of false-flagging folks with visual disabilities. However, as long as you don't notify the candidate that they got it right/wrong, and then ***also*** try a different test that doesn't run the same risk of false-flagging folks with visual disabilities, then this might end up being a very useful tool.

It's not about testing your skill level if you are a real programmer, it's about removing the non-programmers from the interview process before they're wasting our time.\n\nI'm joining a lot of job interviews for my company for the technical part and like 2/3 of applicants are completely unsuited for the job. The other 1/3 are real programmers and we end up taking maybe 1 of 20 applicants.\n\nFor example we're looking for senior full stack devs (>5 yoe) and lots of people send in applications for that without any background in IT/CS and without being able to tell the interviewer what an IP address is or what the differences between compiled and interpreted languages are. I'm very positive that those people also wouldn't be able to solve that simple code puzzle correctly, or any other code puzzle really.\n\nSo yes, a test like this will absolutely filter out all those non-technical applicants that are applying for roles that they're completely unfit for whatever reason. It's not about figuring out how good you are at programming, it's about figuring out whether you can program at all or not.",

Back in the 1980's when I attended university then all you could take into an exam was paper, pen and calculator but only normal calculators that could do basic arithmetic because programmable HP calculators were just appearing and those were banned from the exam room.",

Last week was opencode with Gemini 3 flash to try and refractor a testing tool.\n\nWorked fine for about a day. Then gemini decided to spaz out and give instruction to himself. Cont xt window was still at 25% but even compacting it  didn't work, and a new session tried to either re-refractor already refractored code or make completely insane decision. \n\nI guess it worked fine on my original code but I got problem trying to work on their own.\n\nSpent the next couple of days manually fixing all the dumb decisions the agent made during the 1 day of refactoring.\n\nIssues I had with the code were, in no particular order:\n\n- Non consistent syntax \n\n- Duplicated code (similar to a very junior programmer a lot of copy paste the same 30 line function and change one line  instead of changing the behavior of the one function to accept both cases)\n\n- Questionable architectural decisions (just things that worked, but that you know its going to give you problem in the long run if you do it like that)\n\n- Insanely defensive code ( up to declare a variable with a magic number and then check if it is initialized in the next line)\n\n- Hidden and purposely sneaky errors. (One of the errors i pointed out turns out he fixed it by adding a check at the beginning of the function that basically always returned true in an obfuscated way but didn't actually run)\n\n- Random bugs and small quirks added that only becomes clearer once you actually start to use the program \n\n\nA lot like AI images when you see them you see that they are AI, but you cant put your finger on it. until you start pay attention and you see the 7 fingers and the weird nonsensical stuff in the background.\n\nStill better than Claude 4 was (last one I tried a couple of months before, when everyone was saying that programming is over for humans). But I'll wait for claude 5 next, people say 4.5 is there with Gemini 3, but I dont think is close enough that even if it is slightly better might make me more efficient.\n\nRight now its just slowing me down.\n\nI still use auto completion, always did, I like it because when the code is terrible is a keystroke to delete it and I control the full context and can fix it in the moment instead of having to wait for to go back and tey to understand what the fuck they did.",

That's the main thing that separates successful tech companies from shitty tech companies. In shitty companies, the CEO is often a business major that could not write a hello world script. But in the most successful tech companies that's not usually the case anymore. There was a really big shift in this about 15 years ago or so when the tech world collectively realized that people with zero science or engineering background tend to make really terrible CEOs when the company specializes in advanced technology. For example, Sundar Pichai of Google is an engineer, im sure he can write a hello world. Jensen Huang is an engineer, Lisa Su of AMD is an engineer, Tim Cook of apple is an engineer, Satya Nadella is an engineer. Even Jeff Bezos has a degree in engineering.",

I can give the agent a high level overview of what I want it to accomplish and ask for a detailed plan. It'll build up context scanning relevant areas of the code, reading documentation, etc. and go back and forth with clarifying questions on the requirements. I'll continue nitpicking its suggestions until it aligns with what I need, then I let it run off and do the boring stuff. I review the output and continue asking for refinements or step in to dot the `i`s and cross the `t`s. \n\nIt's not replacing a developer but it's certainly a valuable tool in a developer's hand.",

Only problem the proprietary build system won't build the files, And you can't use yocto because you haven't updated the Recipe... I mean that stuff is normal. \n\nSo what does AI want to do? \n\n1. Write fake fucking Project files for EVERY project it wants to pull it, it gave up after 4 (I knew this was a bad idea from 1).\n2. Stub out our analytics code... But I wanted it to create real artifacts to make this code work and be able to be tested.\n3. Compile under X86 instead of the architecture it was needed for.. .ALSO stub out the code... because why not bring back a bad idea for a third round (probably even higher than that). \n4. Rewrite cmake from the ground up so it would work like yocto   (Literally asked it \"Are you serious?\"  And it realized that was a fucking stupid idea... ) \n\nMy point being... it's GREAT when you haven't read the docs, or you don't want to figure out the build system every time, and you need to push something to git.   It's awful when you run into a problem that isn't already documented somewhere else. \n\nSo no... Ai is not Ready to replace Junior Developers, and it's OBVIOUSLY not.   \n\nAnd again I like AI, I think it's a very useful tool, but it's a useful TOOL.  It's the user of the tool that's responsible.   It makes you more effective, it doesn't replace anyone. \n\nBut anyone who thinks otherwise....well either isn't making it do something interesting or novel or unique, or has gotten EXTREMELY lucky and never really tested it outside of that one point.\n\nPS. That story about \"AI figured out what took us 6 months to figure out.\"  I would put SERIOUS heavy money on the fact that ... the AI read their design documents....    \n\nAlso that example?  it created a prototype, if they could only make a prototype in 6 months... that's a bad sign on them.\n\nEdit: Got another story \"Let's use Sqllite instead of Mysql for local dev.\" ... spoiler, a lot of the migration scripts were designed for mysql.. THATS WHY WE DONT CHANGE DATABASES ON A FUCKING WIM.   Oh and it didn't use mysql, it used mariadb... ugh.",

But now I sometimes need to make something using python, which I don't really have experience with and not a big fan of. However with AI tools I can easily get some results just because:   \n \\- I know exactly what I need  \n \\- I have pretty good idea how the code suppose to look and which checks it needs to have  \n \\- I can easily make changes to the generated code to make it fit the edge cases  \n \\- I will be able to maintain that code as once I saw it, I understood it and I will have zero issues with having to working with it in a long run.\n\nIn that scenario I don't feel like a software developer anymore, more like a person that has plenty of expertise in many technologies that is able to put together anything with any tools and any quality depending on the project requirements. \n\nCan I developer something brand new? Yes, of course. How often do I need  to develop something that doesn't exist or hard to find? Rarely. \n\nIf I make my own project that I care about - I'm not trusting it to any AI.",

Its admission control, scheduling and QoS are primitive to non-existent. Performance analysis at runtime is pretty limited. No native metrics or tracing capabilities. I could go on.

If you have to create a very high transactional application, not  too big , mysql can work better than postgres because there is no vacuum (history is managed in another way ) , no problem like not hot operations (not hot updates and so on) which can be a great problem on postgresql . It is not all black or white . I love postresql, i used it also for a 360tb database , but it is false that mysql has not its point of strenght . there are applications for which mysql has some advantages . Multimaster replication of mysql is really good, Galera for example , or Innodb cluster are something really worth of it if you need a shared nothing write write cluster with many  nodes . We had a cluster with 47 galera 3 nodes system ... for example . I don't believe postgres has a write write cluster like galera or innodb cluster.

Early postgres was kind of weird and not the database it is today.\n\nI jumped to mariadb after the mysql sale. It has been solid for me at the scale I needed. The focus of mysql/mariadb has always been simple CRUD website backends. It wasn't designed to run banking systems and its pretty good at what it does.\n\nAny new project probably should start with postgresql by default and have to justify using anything else.

(Technically, an early version of mariadb).\n\nIt is moving to nginx, rust, and postgres. \n\nWow, what a wildly different development experience:\n\n* Docker makes everything cleaner, \n* nginx is so much less painful, and fast.\n* postgres, the features I can use here are amazing. So much code is vanishing by properly using postgres\n* And while rust is not a common web dev language, it is going to have a few key benefits such as; brutally fast, blazingly brutally fast, smooth development experience with everything just working.\n* While the docker is effectively modern linux, it is on a modern linux VM, making it so much easier to maintain with modern firewalls, etc.\n* Logins using oauth.\n\nOne bit of where doing this as a rust monolith is cool, is that after 20 years of operation, I can be fairly certain of the capacity required. Rust's speed allows for an immense amount of capacity on a crap VM, 100's thousands of requests per second. With a monolith, redis type caching is just built into the application.\n\nBut, postgres is allowing for wonderful datastructures to be cooked up. One of my favourites are arrays. This makes most cases for lookup tables go away. The jsonb makes for a wonderful form of denormalization with heavily pre processed data. Combined with caching to drastically reduce db hits, and performance goes through the roof. \n\nA different application I recently built uses postgres's GIS capability. Amazing.",

My experience is that it is slower up front, but the same slow at the end. \n\nThe usual experience being it is 50% in short order, 90% not long after that, with the last 10% taking twice as long as the 90%; if it ever gets done. Obviously swamped with technical debt.\n\nWith rust projects, I find the technical debt accumulates extremely slowly, as you can depend on earlier code to the extreme.\n\nFor tiny projects where they can accumulate technical debt at almost any speed and still get finished, not so important. \n\nBut, often, I am dealing with projects where the complexity is very high, and technical debt overload is a notable risk.\n\nOne fun one I hit this morning was a particularly grinding file processing step. This was one where even in rust, it is turning the fan on my laptop on, for a single file. Maybe 40 seconds for a file in the top quartile in size.\n\nThe end user is the one uploading these files. Let's just say files per minute might be the measure of the server's performance. \n\nBut, I realized, as a rust wasm application, I can dump that load onto the user, not the server. This may have just changed the server from a 50k per month server to a $10 per month server; as the remaining work is just simple file shuffling, and using highly simplified data extracted from the file by the user.\n\nThe algos to extract the data are not proprietary, thus reverse engineering the wasm isn't a problem.\n\nWhere I find that avoiding some microservices swamp has a huge benefit is simplicity. The key is to ask if complexity is the solution to avoid other complexity. \n\nBut, as I said, one of the real benefits of having such a thing go brutally fast is that it opens up features where responsiveness was a make or break feature.\n\nBut, I've found other minor, but very important benefits to having all the functionality, or at least highly related functionality in the same program. Things like is an administrator logged in? If this is in a shared memory space with instant access, then the confidence in the security can be very high, while the code is extremely simple. Having the data moving through complex paths such as some kind of message queue becomes far cleaner. \n\nOne of the realities I've found with distributed systems is they are effectively multithreaded programming. Most programmers suck at multithreaded programming. Within a single monolith, the threading becomes more, actual threading; and thus it is easier to design an M-N threading model which is then battle hardened.\n\nI would most certainly not recommend this to most people who are not comfortable with this style development. Rust is not an easy language, teams working with compiled codebases require coordination at a level beyond where most people are prepared to go; and this is not an area most people have even toyed with, let alone have experience with.\n\nFor me, and the problems I am solving, it is perfect.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, the web facing part of my work is rarely now users. Most of my work is embedded robotics, sensors, and their interfaces. \n\nSo, for example, I recently made a device (where I used micropython as a test) where there is one user; maybe two. I still made the web interface in rust wasm. This is a toy project, not some mission critical safety critical system.\n\nIt does show this workflow is well fast enough that using my previous decades of experience where I made web stuff \"traditional\" ways was still not easier for me.",

When you are experienced enough with the language then your development speed isn’t meaningfully slower than when using other languages. People have this idea about rust because when they use it for the first time, it is much slower to write because of its differences with OOP languages. Writing it like an OOP language will cause you to constantly fight the compiler.\n\nI like using it for its high quality pattern matching syntaxes, valued enums, Option (lack of a NULL), Result (high quality error handling), and its trait system.

The main thing here seems to be giants bullet point lists of things that went wrong with all these agents interacting with each other it's totally confusing Example:\n\nRuthless triage: If you can't turn a symptom into a task with a measurable outcome quickly, stop and split the work.\n\nOk what on earth does that mean ... It's like a VC writing your documentation.\n\nThere is no actual build at all anywhere that I can download to see if this is actually working. The actions has 63,302 workflow runs which I can't find a single one that has actually ran successfully.\n\nThe git history is complete and utter chaos every day there has been thousands and thousands of git commits for seemingly random stuff all just mixed in with no real proper overarching description. The commit messages don't tell you why but are simply a summary of the diff.\n\nThere are test everywhere. Some of it inline with the code some of it in separate dedicated files. Some of these tests are labelled as test some are not. I think there is an order to this chaos but it's hard to tell as there is no clear docs just giant bullet point lists with VC like speech in them.\n\nThere seems to already be abandoned stuff in this repo for example there are 2 very important structures:\n\nBrowserDocument\nBrowserDocument2\n\nThey seem similar at a high level but seem to be 2 different implementations of the same thing. This is a common pattern to go into a folder and see 2 of the same thing seemingly used for the same thing but with differences. It's like the agent couldn't change one and so just built a different one and changed that instead and left the old one there.\n\nMost of the files are like 500 lines long but there are some mega objects in here that are like 6500 line long files with no structure. The worst one is this:\n\nhttps://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/blob/main/src/resource.rs\n\n30,000 lines in a single file.\n\nSome serious wtf in that file btw have a look through some of those functions my fav is normalize_http_url_for_fetch which seems to be a function to encode a url.\n\nComments are wild. Some files have almost ever single line covered by a comment like the typically LLM generated code that over explains itself as an example other files have no comments whatsoever. There is no pattern at all like a comment block at the top of each file explaining the file some have these some do not.\n\nThere is a mixture of long winded sentences as function names mixed in with almost code golf style 3 character acronym old school 1980's naming.\n\nIt's using an older version of Rust 1.70.0 not sure why.\n\nThere are a shitload of dependencies here I mean like > 100. The most important seems to be a binding lib to quickjs. To me that's not really writing you own js engine but I guess the authors here didn't review this in any way and because it looks like there is a js engine here that's been custom built then they are happy.\n\nI think my summary is that this is a dead end project that will never see the light of day. There is just too much \"stuff\" here and because the authors let this go way too far before they reviewed the thing or because the didn't really know how to build a properly structured browser this can't really go any further.\n\nI suspect the reason this stopped was that the majority of changes that have been happening on the last few days have seen very little progress but just so many changes i.e. the LLMs are now just \"spinning the plates\" and not really progressing. That means this dude probably is thinking \"I better stop spending money now and just let the world see this and declare success\". A bit like how George W declared missioned accomplished.\n\nTo me this is a cautionary tale. Current day LLMs are not ready to tackle large scale projects like this themselves when they are not driven by people whom have a very clear defined vision of how that project should be structured.",

Maybe that's what they meant, that it \"almost compiles\"? :) We can even check https://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/actions?query=is%3Asuccess that the last successful build was... 3 days ago. And since then the agents were just piling-up more and more code, to already broken software. At this point I seriously doubt it's possible to figure out how to fix the build. There are 58 pages of \"successful build\" and 2324 pages of \"failed builds\".\n2. We're talking about writing software that has complete examples on the internet so the model contains the information about how every single of the exact problems was solved in the past. Not \"similar\" problem, not some \"analogy\", the exact problem.\n3. This software also has very clear, fixed guidelines and requirements in the form of RFCs and HTML and JS specs. In a way, this is much closer to solving ACM/LC-style problem than what \"normal software development\" is, where the requirements are fuzzy and ever changing.

One thought I had: If the AI is so smart, why can't it make installers so people can try it out?\n\nI cloned the repo and tried to build it. I got several compiler warnings and errors. I thought maybe I should find a different tag to get a working release, but the project has zero tags.\n\nI looked through the repo. It's 63,000 files. All I can say is: *Yes. It certainly looks like the source code for a working web browser.*\n\nI'd dismiss it entirely (especially after seeing another guy on Reddit claim he made an AI-generated browser from scratch that was just a wrapper around a webview control), but a guy on Twitter (who looks legit) says he's a browser developer and got it to compile after two hours of messing with it. He posted screenshots and it looks like the browser renders websites well enough. I trust he isn't fabricating them.\n\nEDIT: Apparently the guy \"fixed it\" by having an LLM just iterate on it until it compiled. It took about two hours.\n\nStill, I'm... deeply skeptical of these [Potemkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potemkin_village) apps. How much of this is \"from scratch\" and how much is libraries? Why should I trust anything he says? This is the CEO of Cursor, which just reskinned Microsoft Visual Studio Code and integrated it with OpenAI and other APIs. They didn't make an editor and they didn't make an LLM fine-tuned for coding. Any engineering team could do that, but Cursor did it first so the company is now ~~worth~~ valued at $29.3 billion.\n\nI don't even think it's worth the time to investigate these claims anymore. I'm tired of cloning the repos and finding code that doesn't compile. I'm tired of pointing out fake screenshots and broken UIs. I'm just going to give \"ok boomer\" responses to AI news:\n\n\"Wow. Big if true.\"",

The IEEE calls Johnston \"the father of perceptual audio coding\" and a federal court stated both men \"together\" created the standard. Brandenburg's own interviews confirm this.\n\nAs for Ken Thompson - he didn't \"sponsor\" anything. He personally rewrote Johnston's PAC codec (a different codec, not MP3) from Fortran to C. That's not funding, that's engineering.\n\nThe Erlangen work under Musmann was foundational - no one disputes that. But Johnston had working perceptual coding software in 1987, documented under oath in court records. Both streams of research mattered. That's the point.\n\nI'd gently suggest the Zuse and ARPANET tangents aren't really relevant to whether Johnston's contributions to MP3 have been overlooked - which the documentary evidence clearly shows they have been.",

Before I awnser here are my failings in that post above.\n\n- I wrote in a hast on the toilet, I fucked up grammar, orthography and in part cohesive ordering. English being my 2nd language.\n- I used Thompson as a reference, I meant the france company not the person\n- to explain all the intricate details I needed to write way more, but I choose to summarize in an equally superficial way\n\nOn to your reaction:\nThere is a motivation why I even bothered to write in an day old post like this.\n\nMainly the annoyance with the ever repeating distortion of history. Again and again Media such as this reframes collectiv human efforts in a way that frames a limited number of people as sole magician of the new arcane. But thats seldom enough, there is also the need to nationalize the narrative. To force it down and bind it to a perversed limited view.\n\nHere you posted a story of a man left with limited notice to his efforts. Being exclude from the grand narrative stated before.\n\nWhat I was trying to express was that this grand narrative in itself was flawed and wrong in the way it was presented. To my that story is part of a collection of storie: \"the broad and superficial self gradulation of the american mind\".\n\nAgain and again, when any form of Kopernican Revolution are changing the views of an topic, here the encoding of sound,  an intrusive narrative is spune. An american side character takes center stage, saving the day. Almost always independent of what really happend. Missing all the little people who actually planed and build the pyramids.\n\nHere an extraordinary massive part of the actual science was done by drone like minons in the university of erlangen. 4th semester students, to diplomstudents. Helpers helper. All put together, orchestrated by Musmann, long before any Idea of a standard. The collaboration was born because of ISDN. Thats why the france and the bell labs wanted in. Super cheap digital telephony over glass fiber. The music part was an addition for phone loops. Nothing more. Thats where it started. \n\nThey needed Musmanns expertise, got the data long before starting themselves. And building on that.Alot of the really hard bits were already found solutions for, what was left was variations.\n\nAs for the american judicial system in question of inventions. Its has a  horrible history winning liars and cheater. Stealing from all over the world, silencing the true owner. I have no idea what exactly this lawsuit was realy about. But I know that all the titles an accolades are not as earned as presented.\n\nI hope you can follow now why Zuse and the digital network had its place here.\n\nAnd also the other reasion I was annoyed, triggered even, by the article:\n\nI had a stind of 1 semester as an post doc at erlangen. I was brought to a alumni after party in the late 2000s. There I had the pleasure to listen to the stories of the small people, the greavens over the absolut arrogance of the bell lab people. How the bell lab people seemed to be under so much pressure that they constantly tried to reframe ideas of the team as their own. That some diploma final works had to be scraped because the ideas and data was already published without respectfull communication. How the france company was basically fobbed out of millions, thanks to the american way of working. How many were disillusioned by working with so called the best of the best, because some of the stars beyond the pond couldnt even build the experiments correctly without stealing from 22 year old german nobodies who just got pennies because it was just an helper job.\n\nAs my own jorney later on brought me to surprisingly simular realisations. I worked with almost matha-magical indians, chinese, russian and other europeans who had to work with  american companies and universities. \n\nThe pure horror of the in part abysmal differences in competence are still personal horror stories. A few of which are public known by many as grand american successes.\n\nAnd so. Same as it ever was.",

Perceptual codecs using the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform that actually underpins MP3 were being worked on over a decade prior to 1988:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_discrete_cosine_transform\n\n> The discrete cosine transform (DCT) was first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in 1972,[11] and demonstrated by Ahmed with T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1974.[12] The MDCT was later proposed by John P. Princen, A.W. Johnson and Alan B. Bradley at the University of Surrey in 1987,[13] following earlier work by Princen and Bradley (1986)[14] to develop the MDCT's underlying principle of time-domain aliasing cancellation (TDAC) as the core component of an analysis/synthesis filter bank system. TDAC provided efficient critically sampled representations for subband coding applications. Building on this, a 1987 refinement by Princen, A. W. Johnson, and Bradley proposed the \"oddly stacked\" MDCT configuration, which became the predominant form due to its computational efficiency and suitability for real-valued signals",

This thread has been incredibly useful - thank you all for the engagement, including the pushback.\n\nA few things I'm taking away:\n\n**The title was really bad.** Several of you pointed out it reads like Thompson co-created MP3. He didn't - he rewrote Johnston's PAC codec (a different, competing codec). The federal court statement is about Johnston and *Brandenburg* together creating MP3. Two separate facts got mashed together. *My bad. Reddit won't let me fix the title, only the body - ugh*.\n\n**I should have been clearer about audience.** Multiple commenters noted that JJ is well known in the audio coding community - AES, IEEE, MPEG circles. That's true. The article is addressing the *popular* narrative: Wikipedia, mainstream tech journalism, the \"who invented MP3\" Google results. Among peers, Johnston is respected. In public tech history, he's largely absent while Brandenburg gets the \"lone inventor\" treatment.\n\n**The MDCT point is in the article, but could be clearer.** Johnston contributed psychoacoustic modeling; Brandenburg brought MDCT from the Surrey work. The article says \"Brandenburg brought MDCT; Johnston brought perceptual modeling. Neither had the complete picture alone.\" But I can see how that got lost.\n\nI will update the doc to address these points. Also got a comment from Howie Singer, who was actually *at* a2b and wrote a book on it - so there's more to dig into there!\n\nAppreciate the corrections and the good-faith debate.

The benefit of the d3 way seems to just be if you want to do d3 transitions, which do are still more fully featured than most things you might replace them with.\n\nAll that said, I used to be making more flashy and ambitious visualizations with d3, with my current role being more conservative and having me mostly focus on the data going into them.

We plan to remove support in stages, and the next step will be released in jQuery 5.0.\n\nThey're actually planning to release more major versions, too. Makes sense to drop support for older browsers, but it also kinda feel like that might be a good reason to want to use jQuery, to support complex scripting in retro browsers, as niche as that use case may be.\n\nAnyway, I don't think there's really a good argument for using jQuery for new projects these days. Plain JS does everything you want and it's more or less just as convenient. I do believe that DOM manipulation can still be somewhat complicated and verbose in plain JS, though, and jQuery has a nice set of helper functions for it that are pretty powerful. It's not really worth using it just for that, but this is an area where plain JS has always been a little bit unnecessarily awkward.",

This appeared to be an instance of genuine, if primitive, artificial intelligence. That was nine years ago.  \n\nSubsequently, much larger sets of training data were used and the developers began scraping web content in a wholesale manner to create enormous training sets. By the era of ChatGPT3, when OpenAI locked down access to its formerly open source project, they were using 60% of the data in the Common Crawl database which is a large chunk of the Internet Archive. \n\nThere is no second internet to scrape. The data that was contained in the earlier training sets is all we've got. It's what humanity has to offer. You can filter it in different ways but the progress that was made between 2017 and 2022 are not going to be repeated because there is nowhere to turn for new training data. You can re-filter what you've already got but that's not as simple as what went before. \n\nMoreover, you've now got your data poisoned by the abundance of AI generated content that has already been published in the last five years. Simultaneously, progress in computer hardware has nearly come to a halt while costs to manufacture slightly more efficient chips have grown exponentially. The meat has been picked off the bones, the skin and sinews devoured and now there are bunch of hungry carnivores left to fight over what's remains of the bone marrow.",

There's existing code I've written that defines access at a bulk level. Separately, there's code that defines labels at a row level, but not a bulk level like access. \n\nExpanding this bulk feature to include labels needs programming, not engineering. I've already done the engineering when I considered the so many things around this picture (AWS API infrastructure, hosting for application, request protocol, proxy layer for auth, data layer for query invalidation), what I need is more programming (putting the square block in the square hole, use a similar api handler, db query and transactions that already exist). \n\nI can't exactly see myself riding the hype train when I can review code that genuinely satisfies a proper implementation to fit these scenarios. \n\nI was skeptical too before I saw what Cursor is able to pull off when engineering decisions have already been made and are clearly defined, such as my infrastructure being defined in code as well (SST)",

But Morata whole career is about to end and till now nobody realised his potential and fixed his “offside problem” \n\nThat’s how the AI is going to crash.",

Each fab is at least a billion dollars in upfront costs. If the demand for GPU/RAM crashes in the year it takes to get built, it's a net loss for the company. The current capacity is just enough to supply the business market by sacrificing the consumer market, and us consumers will either:\n\n- wait it out\n\n- buy anyways\n\nEither way, it's a win for the manufacturer which will raise prices that will take years to go back down. The only reason the prices would drop sharply would be to have an oversupply, which can't happen because fabs are not getting built.",

They could explain what their product **actually does**\n\n- Amazon: Make it easy for people to buy stuff online\n- Google: Make online search better\n- Facebook: Sell ads on a massive website people want to use because humans are social creatures\n- iPhone: Have websites, camera, phone, apps and GPS in one practical handheld device.\n- Uber: Make it easy to get a taxi\n- AWS: Make it easy to get a server in the cloud.\n\nEvery single one of those can explain, in a single sentence, a clear-cut usecase where their product makes sense. Every single \"moonshot\" that **couldn't** do that, [failed miserably, no matter how much money it burned.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/meta-s-vr-bet-implodes-after-70b-loss-costing-1-500-jobs/ar-AA1UoUFD)\n\nSo, what is the product/vision/plan of most generative AI startups? *\"Uh, yeah, uhmmm, our product, ummmm, kinda will be, like, totally super intelligent, bro, and, uhmmm, do stuff I guess? But it's gonna be super awesome at it and totally make everything super profitable, #trustmebro\"*\n\nThat is not a product vision, that's *religious belief.*\n\n---\n\nRepeating the buzzwords from a bunch of CEOs and VC guys, is not an argument.",

That’s good enough in my book, but I can imagine that problem (among many other reasons) preventing you from adopting smolid.\n\nNope, I like it.\n\nThe endless argument over UUIDs is that there's competing constraints. If you want a UUID that is *forever* unique and meaningful and part of an audit trace, over ANY circumstance - massively distributed, surviving company acquisition, refactoring, decades of bit rot, dumped into logs and schemaless backups, passed between data processors and back, then encode the whole lot.\n\nThe UUID is self-contained within a single application? Sure, scale the timestamp over the period between the date of the first git commit to the age you expect to be long dead, and you've saved some CO_2 emissions.\n\n> I’ll just leave that to the PostgreSQL project or ISO/IEC to fix before 2059.\n\nSensible conclusion in most circumstances! As long as you aren't designing infrastructure, my own \"rule of thumb\" is 25 years, so by that metric this isn't a bad decision for another eight years.\n\n> Only 2 bits for versioning?\n\nAbsolutely enough. Possibly too many. The only valid answers are between zero and two, and 'one' is on thin ice.\n\n> smolid is useful where your peaks are around a thousand new records per second. If this sounds like you, feel free to play with it!\n\nYup! Any faster, stick a queue in front of it. UUIDs aren't going to be the bottleneck.",

Until you understand the dynamics and politics it's easy to do a faux pas that eats at your credibility early, and it's a PITA to push on your projects if you start with burnt bridges you have to amend.\n* I seriously advice against criticizing a project without offering a better alternative. Hell many times if you can identify the key fix that the project will need and you have the cycles, you can start that and when the project hits the issue, you can come in as the hero with the missing piece. If you don't have an idea of how to fix it yourself, or don't have anything to add then honestly let it go.\n* It also should be considered that many successful projects started as really bad projects that then pivoted as they fixed the core issues and it resulted in something radically different. One thing I've learned as a senior is that sometimes you have to let people do it the wrong way so they can find the right way. This is doubly so when you yourself don't know what the right way is going to be.\n* On the Killing a VP project, $50,000 political credibility cost, I'd up the number to $100,000, it's something you don't want to do, and that many people will never do in their lives. I think that projects on that size are messy, and a lot of times you have a lot of leeway in how you interact with things (make it easy to undo or change back) you can negotiate on that space and it's smaller, and even then there's are many ways to do it without saying the project is a bad idea outright, just having issues on your side. The only reason I think this should be used is if it becomes an existential issue: one that would kill *your* project or the entire company. Basically you use this when getting fired is not the worst case scenario because the alternative was very probably going to be you being without a job.\n    * And this one you certainly need to have a better path/alternative that can be done instead, because you'll have to propose something that the company can do.",

I bookmarked it for future projects -- thanks a lot and great work!\n\nI suppose we can leverage some caching at pixel group levels to speed up some lookups, but at the same time the current JS benchmarks seem acceptable (<200ms). \n\nI found the comparison with the blurry ascii interesting as in sometimes I'd want to achieve a blurry effect rather than sharp, and later on you clarified that the lookup can be parameterized to achieve control over this. \n\nAny plans on taking it further, say, by using color mapping? Again, great work!",

TL;DR: I quantize the components of the sampling (shape) vector to one of 8 possible values and use those to construct a cache key. I then use that to create a lookup table around 2MB in size, which makes lookups very, very cheap.\n\nBut yeah, a lot of effort went into making this run smoothly on mobile. The other primary performance concern is collecting the sampling vectors themselves and performing contrast enhancement, both of which I needed to delegate to the GPU. On my (admittedly powerful) laptop, the full pipeline for rendering a frame takes around 2ms. The [appendix on GPU acceleration](https://alexharri.com/blog/ascii-rendering#appendix-gpu-acceleration) briefly covers this.\n\nBut no plans to implement color for now. It would be interesting to look at, though!",

                  "text": "In the company it was literally points. Tasks all had points. If you completed a task, you got the points, the tasks were reviewed, and the reviewer got 1/3rd the points. \n\nAny minor bug in the task had to be fixed quickly to retain the points, major bugs, lost everyone the points.\n\nThen, a bonus pool was allotted, and each got their share based on their share of the points.\n\nThe founders aggressively watched for people working too many hours, this was one of very few firing offences up there with sexual harassment. \n\nThey had a system where each task got a red, orange, or green code. Red tasks had to be done before orange, and orange before green; assuming you had the ability to do the red or orange tasks. Each task had points assigned to it by the founders, but anyone could suggest a task. Someone might say, \"Rewrite the entire system in Go\" and the founders might assign that -1,000,000 points as a hard no.\n\nBut, you might say, \"Experimentally rewrite the comms module in rust and compare performance.\" and this might get 100 points. Changing the wording of \"Open File\" to \"Open PDF\" in a menu might be 1 point.\n\nAnyone could pick any task; but only one task at a time. Anyone could code review. But, if your code was consistently crap, the people who were really good at code reviews would stop reviewing your code as they weren't getting points from it, and you would stop getting points. Thus a crap programmer would just eventually quit. You didn't want to take your code to a crap reviewer as they would miss bugs, and you could lose points. You didn't take your code to the pedantic fool who focused on code style guides made up in their head, and ignored brutalizing your code with potentially their own unit tests like the great code reviewers would do.\n\nOn the point of juniors. This was a great environment for ones with potential; as code reviewers would tell them what would be needed for them to fix up their code, and be better prepared for their next review. Also, juniors could pair program, as this would increase the points by 20%. That is if something was worth 30 points, and two people paired on it, they would each get 18 points. People were willing to do this with promising juniors.\n\nThings like people with poor communications skills almost instantly floundered and soon left; as nobody told them what to do, you had to ask and figure things out.\n\nThe difference in take home pay could be enormous. People who were OK, and did stick around might pull in 100k or less. But a coding performance monster could easily crack 1m. There were people pulling in more than this who worked a day or two a week and took massive vacations. They would just knock off one brutally hard task after another with really good code for the time they were there. The point pool might be 8m points, and these guys could come in and knock off 10 1k tasks in a single week. These were tasks that most programmers would choke on and give up after a month. A task might be, \"Get the present messaging system past 100k messages per second. with 10 points awarded for every 1k messages per second more; max 1k points. And these guy would make an FPGA network card which could handle 2m messages per second. Nobody even thought of building their own network card and were thinking about screwing with the linux network stack or something.\n\nThese were the people who kept moving the needle forward for the company and were well rewarded for doing so. This incentive structure would then attract more of these stars; often not because they could earn so much, but earn lots while working very very little and not be pressured to work 60h+ for the same pay at most other places. \n\nThe best part of this place is watching the fogies try to explain to me why the place didn't work. Some people simply can't wrap their heads around such a different culture. They live in worlds where micromanagers use gantt charts to populate jira task lists, and by putting them on a kanban board they think they are being modern. But, all they do is assign tasks, wonder why people aren't being creative, complain about \"herding cats\" and then watch as their uninspired projects run wildly overbudget, are late, and really disappoint the end users (oh, I should have called them stakeholders).",

Yes they're both \"companies\" but if that's the only information you judge on, how accurate can you be?\n\nCloudflare won't aim to shut down other website builders, because they don't make money on that. WordPress, however, has their entire business model dependent on it being \"hard\" to make your own website, and \"hard\" to find a host. Ergo, if they bought up this option, they would be incentived to put it behind a paywall or shut it down.\n\nCloudflare, on the other hand, doesn't make their money by charging to help create a website. They make their money by their pro services required for hosting non-trivial content (i.e. databases, lamdas, etc). And they can recognize that Astro only works because it's not paid (it's market is developers who know how to code, unlike WordPress).\n\nSo, yes, if you take the view that \"muh corporation runs software now\", it's equally as bad if any company runs it. But, if you have a bit of nuance you might realize that actually there are better or worse things that can happen to software.\n\nIf Cloudflare switches up, and tries to close-source this, or charge for currently free features, I would be SHOCKED. And I'd instantly call that out as a bad thing. But, that hasnt happened, doesn't seem like it will happen, and again, would probably be a dumb move.\n\nI don't think you've actually used Cloudflare, and know what I'm trying it say.
