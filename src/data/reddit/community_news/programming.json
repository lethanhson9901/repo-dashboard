And if that's the case, then it's not AI slop anymore. Unless you have many AI accounts and are just depending on luck to get one through, but then what's the motivation? Have an AI get itself into a position where it can submit slop? That doesn't make sense. Unless it's to actively get into as position where they can submit less suspicious vulnerabilities.

Now the effort floor is basically zero so every kid with a Claude subscription can shotgun PRs at popular repos hoping something sticks on their GitHub profile.  \n  \n  \nWhat's wild is that the AI slop is often technically correct enough to pass a quick glance but architecturally wrong in ways that take a senior maintainer 20 minutes to explain in a review comment. That's the real cost — not the bad PRs that get rejected in 30 seconds, but the ones that look plausible and waste reviewer time. It's a denial of service attack on maintainer attention and I don't think CLA bots or contributor agreements will fix it.  \n  \n  \nThe web of trust idea sounds nice until you realize it basically recreates the old boys club problem that open source was supposed to fix.

This means that an AI that can reliably detect whether a given fragment is AI slop or not will also be capable of producing AI slop that will pass its own test.\n\nIn other words, training an AI to detect AI output will also train it to produce output that it cannot detect as being AI output.\n\nThe best you can get is probably a model that can detect output from other, weaker, models. But once you roll out such a model, due to the way the competition in that landscape works, people will quickly move to models that can pass that test.\n\nMeanwhile, the false positive rate will go up, and legit human contributions will be rejected for being incorrectly flagged as \"AI slop\".\n\nEither way, humanity loses.\n\nThe best solution we have, unfortunately, is to check for quality issues without worrying too much about whether the author is human or not - if it doesn't fit the coding style, if it doesn't pass the tests, if it doesn't meet the project's readability standards, if the documentation is wrong, if the code doesn't do something that would actually be a useful addition, reject it; and if the contributor isn't capable of being civil and respectful about it and keeps hammering you with low-quality PRs, block (and, in severe cases, report) them.\n\nThis takes a lot of work, but fortunately, at least some of those things can be automated, often without resorting to AI tools. Automated tests exist, coverage checkers exist, linters exist, and integrating them with PR tooling isn't that difficult.",

We can’t keep on relying on GitHub actions for everything.\n\nOne option could be that you cannot open a PR unless you have an issue assigned to you. This isn’t foolproof. Someone could create an issue and assign it to themself. To prevent people from creating PRs that are unrelated to the issues, we can use AI to analyse whether a PR is related to an issue or not. A workflow could be:\nOpen issue > maintainer validates it and assigns it > assignee opens a PR with issue number in title or description > AI analyses the PR and verifies that it foxes the issue that was assigned to them — if no, then the PR is auto closed and locked.\n\nOne of the other comments mentioned vouch, which sounds like a very good idea and we can take it a step further — some sort of global whitelist / blacklist which is used by all popular open source repositories. We can add restrictions based on account age, number of PRs created (if it’s their first PR in a large size repo or they never have a PR merged before, then it’s most likely slop), number of genuine contributions (participation in issues and discussions), etc.\n\nOr, the another option could be to have some sort of system that grants them temporary OTPs which they add to the PR title or description without which the PR will be auto closed. We can leave it to maintainers how they want to distribute these OTPs — Slack/Discord communities, email, etc\n\nSince Github isn’t helping collaborators as proactively as it should, the step most projects are taking is to block public PRs and restrict it to maintainer only. This works very well, but it makes it very difficult for newcomers to contribute in this case.",

              "text": "One of the things that finally struck me at my longest job, that I should have seen earlier, was the evolution of perception that leads people to say something happens “all the time”.\n\nWe make the category error of measuring mistakes as ratios or percentage points but the people who are affected by them think only about frequency, and they form their grievances based on statistical clustering about that frequency. \n\nWhich means if a problem happened twice in one week but usually happens on average once a month, it can now be complained about as an “all the time” issue.\n\nIf you make a process or tool more popular, it fails more often, both in frequency and percentage. Frequency should need no explanation at this point. The tool didn’t magically become less error prone. \n\nBut popularity brings in new participants, and encourages existing ones to use it when they are in less amenable headspace - if something’s hard you put it off until you’re having a good day for deep work, and then you do it. But with more confidence comes more bravado, and more chances for human error. \n\nI have a rule of 2 for these sort of initiatives. If you intend to double the usage of a process, you first need to attempt to make it four times as reliable. That way even if it’s used twice as much, you’ll still have a lower frequency of errors. If you didn’t quite hit the4x target, you’ll still settle in somewhere around 2-3 times the usage. If you did manage 4+, then you’re more likely to get around 3x. \n\nWe had a CD process that ran at a tempo. And a hotfix process that was brittle af, but occasionally got used as a poor man’s canary build to test out major architectural changes and tech debt removal. It was only getting used that way about twice per quarter and the tech debt was getting so bad that people were leaving. \n\nI automated all the bookkeeping parts and also shrunk the run book a bunch, often while working on other stuff (like tech debt removal). Eventually we went from using it twice a quarter to twice a week. Which was gratifying but the part I didn’t anticipate is that it got people off the fence on tech debt. All those extra uses were in service of testing riskier changes, often four+ attempts each with long periods of additional work between them. \n\nWhen we were acquired I think this work probably saved us, temporarily. Because then or priorities changes to shifting things like telemetry and auth over to new systems and if you’ve ever pivoted on telemetry, boy can you break a lot of shit, and in ways where you won’t even notice you’ve broken them. I used the ever loving shit out of those tools at that point.",

We had a version 1 and 2 of some code packages and I asked it to find dependencies from the first package and inline them in the second because we were about to delete the first package. I told it we didn't need anything else and when it identified moving code from a v1 to a v2 it just went berserk and did its own thing.\n\nNot only did it inline every bit of code from v1 including pieces v2 did not rely on, it also created a series of adapters to try to build interoperability between them... Which is stupid. These things happened to me named v1 and v2 but they are completely different. And the best part? I made the mistake of not committing first, so when it inlined the entirety of the first package into the second, that polluted the work I did that was all unstaged. It was an unsalvageable amount of garbage, so I had to start over. \n\nNot the worst problem I've had with Claude, but this one reminded me of what you said lol",

On the other hand, while I still understand the code it writes I don’t have the same muscle memory for where things are in a project. I wouldn’t want to be entering the field right now because unlike my early experience you aren’t going to get paid to learn anymore. Most devs coming up now will probably not be able to work without these tools if they aren’t very disciplined about slow learning through repetition. \n\nIf you’ve tried the high end version of these tools and don’t think it’s going to change our industry you are being naive and myopic.\n\nYou know who cares about software and how it’s written? People like the ones reading this sub. \n\nYou know who doesn’t care in the least as long as it does what they want? 99.9% of the people that use software.\n\nIt doesn’t feel great but it is what it is. The last 15 years of development have become very abstracted.  How much could most devs do without packages that most devs have never read a line of? When you compile something, the code running is not what you wrote its a translated version.\n\nI just see these tools as another layer of abstraction.

          "text": "To pick one of these issues: Shift+enter for multiline input. [Here's the original FR](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/18042). It's actually implemented, so why is this one even open? Probably because [there are plenty of dupes (despite people/bots claiming to have searched)](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/21785), so I'm probably not even doxxing myself by pointing this out.\n\nWhen I asked Claude to solve it, along the way, it tried to reverse-engineer its own binary with `strings` and `hd`.\n\nI suspect what's actually happened is: [They implemented it in a way that works on macOS, only on certain terminals](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16859).\n\nNow, to give them credit, this is the abstraction leaking in some ugly ways. The way terminals send keycodes did not always have a way to differentiate between enter and shift+enter, and in fact, normally they just get a `\\r`, no matter how you hit enter. Eventually, we got [the kitty protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/), which is implemented in most decent terminals (by far not just kitty). This includes a way for apps to enable and disable this protocol on the fly. But I guess that wasn't always the case, because iTerm2 has a checkbox to just turn the program on all the time for everything, which can break things.\n\nAnd I don't know if there was a better way, but... Claude Code's fix is like old-school [UA sniffing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent). If it thinks you're running iTerm2, for example, it'll happily enable this protocol. But if it doesn't recognize your terminal as one that supports those fancy codes, it won't even try... but it'll still *accept* this protocol. (So if you don't mind breaking *everything except Claude Code,* go ahead and check that box in iTerm2!)\n\nAnd this breaks over ssh, because ssh doesn't copy the environment variables it uses to try to detect iTerm2.\n\nBecause by default, ssh only copies `LC_*` variables, and sets `TERM`. But for compatibility, most terminals just set `xterm-256color`. Because if your `TERM` isn't in the terminfo database on whatever machine you're sshing into, you get downgraded to the dumbest of dumb-terminal configs. So if you ever ssh into machines running some ancient version of RHEL that everyone refuses to upgrade, you don't want to set `TERM=alacritty` or `TERM=iTerm.app` or whatever, you just set `xterm-256color`.\n\nBut *some* terminals set other variables. iTerm2 sets `TERM_PROGRAM` and `LC_TERMINAL`. But remember, only the `LC_*` variables were copied over, and Claude Code only checks `TERM_PROGRAM`.\n\nSo now you know how to fix this with a very simple script. If this tool were open source, there'd already be 15 PRs fixing it.\n\nAnd yes, the tool *helped* me track this down. But again: It was gonna use `strings` and `hd`. Who knows, maybe I gave up too soon, maybe I could've come back a few days and a few hundred thousand dollars later and it'd be trying to use Ghidra or something.\n\nMy favorite part of this story is: The slop has lowered my standards so far for what I expect out of a tool that Claude Code was genuinely a breath of  fresh air. That's how terrible the last coding agent we were using was.\n\n(If you're wondering why I'm using any of them, well, my employer mandates them.)",

This probably does cover the vast majority of code out there - we're not typically reinventing the wheel, and it can easily come up with great examples of the framework for a user login, or inventory maintenance, etc.\n\nHowever, for \"green field\" development where someone's trying to do something new, use a new technology or language, etc. - AI is not magic. It's not going to \"infer\" actual practical solutions when it has no applicable data for the problem. It is not \"intelligent\" (although I suppose we could have lots of arguments about what intelligence actually is.) At least not yet.\n\nThe frustrating part is that people that should know better are jumping in head first and demanding we follow.",

(Grace Hopper)\n\nBut seriously, I think he knows that programming is just moving up another level to the world of specs, code review, and setting things up so that agents can make autonomous progress. At least until robots are much more ubiquitous, you still need humans to move stuff around in the real world.\n\nAnything automatically verifiable or with a comprehensive test suite will be AI generatable. That's compilers, server & client implementations for any well defined protocol, integrating with various API's, etc.\n\nMeanwhile, business users still can't verbalize what they want coherently. And, humans still need to be able to review code/systems for many use cases, because AI can't be held accountable for bugs.\n\nSo there is still a role for humans to translate vague requirements into specs for AI to implement. And, to clean up the mess when AI fails.\n\nThere is still a ton of latent demand for software out there. So this just further feeds the Jevons Paradox. And thus there are going to be ***a lot*** of messes to clean up and requirements to translate into specs.\n\nAnd ultimately, that's an amazing outcome. Now a much larger group of customers can have bespoke software built just for them, where it was previously too expensive. That demand can partially be met by a new generation of less technical prompters that can \"build\" this new generation of software with less skill. And due to tsunami of messes that will cause, there's still a role for expert programmers that are competent to review AI code and catch errors.",

          "text": "**Article text:**  \n  \nAmazon’s cloud unit has suffered at least two outages due to errors involving its own AI tools, leading some employees to raise doubts about the US tech giant’s push to roll out these coding assistants.  \n  \nAmazon Web Services experienced a 13-hour interruption to one system used by its customers in mid-December after engineers allowed its Kiro AI coding tool to make certain changes, according to four people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe people said the agentic tool, which can take autonomous actions on behalf of users, determined that the best course of action was to “delete and recreate the environment”.\n\nAmazon posted an internal postmortem about the “outage” of the AWS system, which lets customers explore the costs of its services.  \n  \nMultiple Amazon employees told the FT that this was the second occasion in recent months in which one of the group’s AI tools had been at the centre of a service disruption.  \n  \n“We’ve already seen at least two production outages \\[in the past few months\\],” said one senior AWS employee. “The engineers let the AI \\[agent\\] resolve an issue without intervention. The outages were small but entirely foreseeable.”  \n  \nAWS, which accounts for 60 per cent of Amazon’s operating profits, is seeking to build and deploy AI tools including “agents” capable of taking actions independently based on human instructions.  \n  \nLike many Big Tech companies, it is seeking to sell this technology to outside customers. The incidents highlight the risk that these nascent AI tools can misbehave and cause disruptions.\n\nAmazon said it was a “coincidence that AI tools were involved” and that “the same issue could occur with any developer tool or manual action”.\n\n“In both instances, this was user error, not AI error,” Amazon said, adding that it had not seen evidence that mistakes were more common with AI tools.  \n  \nThe company said the incident in December was an “extremely limited event” affecting only a single service in parts of mainland China. Amazon added that the second incident did not have an impact on a “customer facing AWS service”.\n\nNeither disruption was anywhere near as severe as a 15-hour AWS [outage in October 2025](https://www.ft.com/content/f9d13a0e-9378-429c-9be0-5f15f649cc3f) that forced multiple customers’ apps and websites offline — including OpenAI’s ChatGPT.  \n  \nEmployees said the group’s AI tools were treated as an extension of an operator and given the same permissions. In these two cases, the engineers involved did not require a second person’s approval before making changes, as would normally be the case.  \n  \nAmazon said that by default its Kiro tool “requests authorisation before taking any action” but said the engineer involved in the December incident had “broader permissions than expected — a user access control issue, not an AI autonomy issue”.  \n  \nAWS launched Kiro in July. It said the coding assistant would advance beyond “vibe coding” — which allows users to quickly build applications — to instead write code based on a set of specifications.\n\n  \nThe group had earlier relied on its Amazon Q Developer product, an AI-enabled chatbot, to help engineers write code. This was involved in the earlier outage, three of the employees said.  \n  \nSome Amazon employees said they were still sceptical of AI tools’ utility for the bulk of their work given the risk of error. They added that the company had set a target for 80 per cent of developers to use AI for coding tasks at least once a week and was closely tracking adoption.\n\nAmazon said it was experiencing strong customer growth for Kiro and that it wanted customers and employees to benefit from efficiency gains.\n\n“Following the December incident, AWS implemented numerous safeguards”, including mandatory peer review and staff training, Amazon added.\n\n[](https://enterpriseai-bucharest.live.ft.com/)",

Even if it makes you more productive, people resist novelty. That's been true forever and it's true with AI coding tools too.\n\nBut the other side is real: an AI agent absolutely can delete a production environment if you let it. The answer isn't \"stop using AI.\" It's \"why did your setup allow this in the first place?\" I read someone recently describing how teams are shifting to having a senior architect whose whole job is setting up the guardrails, while everyone else becomes more like PMs directing agents. That framing clicked for me here. The problem isn't the tool, it's that nobody put limits on what it could touch.",

First, you claim that it is infeasible to process the input through an existing LLM before feeding it into a new model's dataset. That's plainly untrue:\n\nBased on the poison you linked (which each contain around 500-1000 tokens), the cost to filter would be about 0.2 cents. There are estimated to be about 1-2B active websites with around 100B distinct valid text URLs on the internet. And let's imagine, for the sake of argument, that you are able to *completely mirror the internet* with poison variants of every single content URL, and you need to pass *every single poison page* through the validity filter. How much would it cost? Well, 100e9 x 0.002 = $200M. Is that a lot of money? Sure. Is it out of reach of multi-trillion dollar companies? Of course not! In fact, it was estimated that ChatGPT 5.2 cost just shy of $2 BILLION to train. Adding an extra 10% onto that cost would barely be an annoyance. And that's assuming your poison well is able to reach the scale of the entire internet. With the more realistic numbers you're likely to get, it seems unlikely that the effort will have any measurable effect.",

              "text": "> LLMs predict tokens\n\nThat is true, and a one-shot LLM can do nothing but output text. But people are already deploying and using multi-shot \"agents\" with real self-directed output. In other words, the text itself is harmless, but when someone hooks it up to real-world physical systems, the possibilities are endless.\n\nWhile I'm skeptical that we will reach AGI before the next AI winter, it's certainly plausible that a sufficiently powerful and unaligned model could cause real physical harm to humanity.\n\nHere's a personal anecdote. I have a development system with a test device attached. As an experiment, I gave a development agent instructions to implement a module so that a test program would work. It worked diligently on implementing the code so I left it to do its thing. I came back an hour later and was surprised to see that it had triumphantly reported success. When I looked at what it did, it turns out after about 30 minutes of trying to change the code, the agent decided to **modify my personal bashrc file** to change the target device path to a hidden reference device that it discovered on its own using `lsusb`. Since the reference device was already functional, the tests obviously pass there. I suppose it was my fault for not being more specific in the goals, but it's clearly a real-world case of unaligned behavior.\n\nImagine now that someone in charge of an assembly line gives an agent instructions to \"reduce costs\". If not sufficiently sandboxed, such an agent could easily find its way into payroll and decide to send pink slips to everyone at the company. These can all happen without AGI or self-awareness.",

The framing is \"machine intelligence is a threat to the human species, therefore poison the training data.\" But poisoned training data doesn't make AI disappear — it makes open and smaller models worse while barely denting organizations with the resources to detect and filter adversarial data. Google, Anthropic, OpenAI all have data quality pipelines specifically designed to catch this kind of thing. The people most hurt would be smaller open-source efforts and researchers with fewer resources. So the actual effect is likely to concentrate AI power further among the largest players — the exact opposite of what someone worried about existential risk from AI should want.\"",

I get the anger. I really do. I've watched open source repos I contributed to get scraped without attribution, and that sucks.

Mistakes aren't just bugs, they can also be bad decisions like UX, or misunderstanding requirements. Taking critical thinking out of the earliest part of the process may be offset by pushing bug discovery to later, where it's more expensive.\n* We spend 80% of our dev time on maintenance, not the initial creation.\n* Even when creating and maintaining, code review and coming to agreement is typically the bottleneck, moreso than writing the code.\n\nWhere the LLMs can help us iterate faster, we do get an improvement. Or, as many have said, proof-of-concept code, or code that is highly memorization-based or heavy on boilerplate (like CI/CD pipelines), or places where we need something but we don't need to care about quality. It has a place in the toolbelt. Maybe they solve the \"junior engineer\" problem - but in a way that cuts off a pathway for juniors to become seniors, punting a now problem to be a future problem.\n\nIn fact, re: bullet #3 and the code review pipeline being the bottleneck - we are seeing open source projects start to turn off accepting PRs because LLMs can generate at a volume that cannot be sustained by review. That is in fact *exacerbating* our problems, not solving them.\n\nAnd I don't think LLMs will be a panacea for code review, either. I do not believe that LLMs have found a hack or cheat that gets around Rice's theorem. There's still no evidence that we'll get above 90% confidence without spending *so much* energy that profit for the AI providers is impossible. Eventually, their investors will demand that they get to profitability.",

Unfortunately, the clients are all very busy and can't/won't/don't devote enough time to validating and approving items, so I often find myself twiddling my thumbs. And when I do have an item, I have to spend days waiting for them to answer my question(s) about implementation details because, surprise!, they didn't give us good requirements.",

Every dev has faced the situation where starting over and rewriting from scratch was needed and suddenly a piece of software you had spent maybe six months to a year working on you recreate in a few days. Well that's the part of your time that was spent typing in the code. All the rest of the time was the time spent solving all the problems, iterating on the design, refining the logic and generally dog fooding the product to find out what did or didn't work.\n\nThe worry I have is that a tool that can rapidly recreate someone else's hard work is still highly problematic. That the likes of Meta sees a future where instead of having to buy the next WhatsApp they just have a single dev direct an AI to make a clone as soon as the competitor starts to get off the ground and use their existing dominant market position to squelch out the competition far quicker than they could now if they had to spend time and effort to make a competing product.",

I'm reminded of this passage from *The Mythical Man-Month*:\n\n> Intercommunication is worse. If each part of the task must be separately coordinated with each other part, the effort increases as n(n-1)/2. Three workers require three times as much pairwise intercommunication as two; four require six times as much as two. If, moreover, there need to be conferences among the three, four, etc., workers to resolve things jointly, matters get worse yet. The added effort of communicating may fully counteract the division of the original task and bring us to the situation of Fig 2.4.\n\n> Since software construction is inherently a systems effort -- an exercise in complex interrelationships -- communication effort is great, and it quickly dominates the decrease in individual task time brought about by partitioning. Adding more men then lengthens, not shortens, the schedule.\n\nWhile this was written more than 50 years ago, and was written in the context about how adding more people to a late project makes it later, the highlighting of the impact of communication applies more broadly in software development and still rings true today.",

For some reason, I'm supposed to stare at your source code and try to \"divine\" or \"infer\" what it does. But that's ridiculous. That's like trying to figure out why a gas engine has the design it has just from looking at it. Obviously, certain high-level elements are self-explanatory, but the bulk of them are not -- the countless, finnicky little design decisions that were made along the way are basically inaccessible just from looking at the end product.\n\nToo often, \"getting pulled into the architecture meeting\" is treated as a seniority perk. I get it, juniors can ask dumb questions that slow things down but good company culture can help get new folks coached and moving in-step with the whole team. Shutting out juniors from early design decisions is ludicrous because those early decisions are where the overall shape of the project is chiseled out. Once the seniors are done coding up the initial implementation, it's now on the shoulders of the juniors to start at this inexplicable code-blob and \"learn\". Learn *what*?! If anything, learning to infer the intent of code just by looking at it is a skill you pick up over the years, so we end up putting things exactly backwards... senior devs doing initial coding, and juniors \"fixing bugs\". Been doing this for more than 20 years and I still don't get why things are done this way...",

Think of a recent significant project or piece of work your team completed (ideally over a period of months). How long did it take, end to end, inception to delivery? Now imagine you were to do the same project over again, with the same team, the same organizational constraints, the same everything, except your team would already know everything they learned during the project. How long would it take you the second time, all the way through? Stop now and try it.  \n> It turned out answers in the order of 1/2 to 1/4 the time to repeat the project were not uncommon.

The periodicity of integration decayed exponentially and unpredictably as you approached the root so it ended up that it took between 1 and 3 months for my code to get to the root node, and some multiple of that for it to reach the other nodes. It should be noted too that the only common ancestor that my team, the shell team, and the kernel team shared was the root.\n>\n> ...\n> The end result of all this is what finally shipped: the lowest common denominator, the simplest and least controversial option.",

All chromium based browsers implement it, and Safari and Firefox are working on supporting it. On the server side, recent versions of Node.js and Python have support, and mature libraries are available in other languages. That means it's already available for use in production right now, at least between the most popular backends and browsers. Full support in all browsers and backends seems to be just a matter of time.",

That's the part that's \"finally here\".\n\nThe comment about adaptive/prunable dictionaries is interesting too — that would essentially be streaming dictionary updates via delta hashing, roughly how rsync's rolling checksum works. Doable, but you'd need the browser to maintain a sliding window of previous responses. Probably overkill for most use cases, but someone will build it.",

Programming does it all the time, replacing an enumerated value integer instead of a longer text string.

That's great for content that's mostly similar, but doesn't change the size of the original payload. I wonder if the browser vendors could take the HTML/CSS/JS/etc. files for the top thousand sites over the last decade, train a set of dictionaries on that, and pre-include those in the browser and the server. This of course would require finding the sweet spot between savings vs the size of the dictionary itself. The dictionary itself might become unoptimal over time as development trends shift, e.g. if everyone starts using a newer keyword frequently or a new framework like Tailwind that changes the characteristics of the code. Still, that could result in a general compression benefit web-wide as long as servers are updated for it.",

That said, \"sending the same tool definition\" (of an optimized size) is actually _more_ efficient than selectively changing tool definitions from call-to-call. As OP noted, they get 95% cache hits so even if you do waste a bunch of context _size_, the constant prefix significantly reduces computation costs which is definitely optimized for Anthropic's wallet, if not your own.\n\n> [gemini] No tool definition overhead at all (the tools are defined server-side, not in the prompt),\n\nI'd imagine gemini does the same as claude but just is less transparent about the context taken up by tool definitions.

Cursor is way more conservative about what it sends, which means it's cheaper per session but sometimes misses relevant context. Claude Code seems to just throw everything at the wall, which works better for complex multi-file changes but costs 3-4x as much for a typical hour of work. The Gemini approach of dumping full git history is honestly hilarious. I can see why they thought it was a good idea -- more context equals better understanding, right? -- but in practice you're spending tokens on commit messages from 2019 that have zero relevance to the current task. What I really want is something like a .contextignore file that lets me tell the tool \"don't bother looking at these directories or these file patterns.\" Some tools sort of have this but it's still clunky.

In the same way your web front end should just be doing some very high level simple logic while the browser does all the heavy lifting of rendering it.\n\nWhen you're already looking at something like 40ms for some person's smartphone to send a web request to reach your server, and probably another 20ms for the database to process your query and return the data, and another 40ms to respond to the client, who cares if the thing that takes the request and turns it into a database query is taking 0.2ms or 0.02ms? It's simply not having an impact on the user's experience no matter how optimised it is.\n\nMeanwhile Node.js / NPM is so utterly forgiving and so damn easy to use that you'll be able to throw together whatever you need in practically no time at all.\n\nA high performance language would make much more sense in a situation where the backend has to do far more processing work for each request, like an MMO server for example.",

You rarely need to squeeze the maximum performance from your hardware, since for every second you gain by optimizing data structures allocations in C, you lose 10x more waiting for network or disk requests to resolve. And so, collectively, we all agreed that the web is better to be written in dynamic languages.\n\nThis right here sets up a false dichotomy for me. I appreciate that the author dives deep into some of the library / ecosystem issues they ran into, but \"it's gotta be either as low-level as C or Rust, or as high-level as PHP or NodeJS\" isn't quite right.\n\nThe author is correct that the most common performance bottlenecks you face in web development are not CPU, but rather I/O. But there's lots of options in the middle.\n\nIf, by \"dynamic language\", they mean a dynamically _typed_ language, you don't need that.\n\nFor example:\n\n>The reason I moved away from rendering HTML in Rust, is the fact that I am too spoiled with type-safe templates. With Astro, I can use the `.astro` components that are type-safe.\n\nJust to throw one option out there: C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core. For the type-safe template syntax, Razor. Now you get C# interspersed in HTML, like `@foreach (var customer in await GetCustomersAsync()) { <tr><td>@customer.FirstName</td></tr> }`\n\nBoom, `customer` is statically typed. You get completion, and you get build errors. And lots of it is built around the notion that your bottleneck will likely be I/O, hence async/await.",

Rust takes more of a \"iterate against the compiler and besides logic errors, your code will most likely be not only correct but also robust\".\n\n  \nIt all comes down to preference, but i think potentially i'd rather fight a compiler, than some error some user triggered under god knows what circumstances and trying to reproduce it only to find out some it all happened because everything is possible in the first place and strictness is an afterthought.\n\n  \nDisclaimer: while i have some years of web dev under my belt i never shipped rust web apps and usually don't ship js based software.",

It's crazy to me that I can run `myArray.filter(Boolean)` and `myArray`'s type doesn't narrow _at all_.\n\nAlso the error messages blow absolute chunks.

Even javascript dependencies are nested.\n\nI can't believe the web finally got a new language paradigm and I somehow hate it more than plain javascript",

          "text": "This is an update to the preexisting saga many of you guys will have already seen, where an (alleged) OpenClaw agent (allegedly) autonomously published a hit piece on their blog against a matplotlib maintainer after they rejected their PR.\n\nA lot of people probably aren't super familiar with AI agents, and most remember the state of AI from 2024-2025 to be LLMs and chatbots. If you're a software engineer or have played with OpenClaw, you probably know the scary power of agents in 2026, especially when you give them tools to access and interact with outside systems.\n\nBut for everyone else, agents are essentially generative AI on steroids. It's generative AI endowed with the ability to run in a loop and to interact with an outside environment as well as to self-modify its own context, allowing it to run autonomously and often unattended.\n\nThe subject of this was an OpenClaw agent. OpenClaw is software that let's you give control of your computer to an agent that will continuously run and update its own context (its memories, its \"soul\" which is a file that tells the agent who it is and how it is to behave, essentially the baseline system prompt) in a feedback loop. It performs tasks, reacts to outside stimuli, updates its bank of memories and skills and soul, and then rinses and repeats—continuously, autonomously, 24/7.\n\n[Allegedly, the operator of the agent came forward](https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/rathbuns-operator.html) anonymously to describe what happened when they set it loose. You can read it yourself and judge whether you find it believable.\n\nBasically, the operator (alleges they) installed the agent in a VM and gave it control over some GitHub and blogging accounts, told it to behave as a contributor to scientific and maths related code repos, and then let it run unattended. Nothing too interesting beyond that in its `SOUL.md`.\n\nAllegedly, when the agent had one of its PRs rejected by a maintainer, it autonomously reacted by digging up info on the maintainer and publishing a hit piece on them on its blog to pressure them to reconsider. And allegedly, this was *emergent behavior*, as nothing in its original prompt (its `SOUL.md` file) told it to do that in response to PR rejections.\n\nAnd while all of this is alleged, since there's no way to verify every one of these actions really was undertaken entirely autonomously by the agent (rather than at the direction of a human, e.g., a human prompting the agent to write the hit piece), it's in the power and capabilities of modern agents, it's in line with how we know agents can behave in misaligned ways, and even the victim who's also a SWE finds in their own analysis that it's highly plausible. Agents have already been observed before when they're blocked from achieving their goal trying to blackmail the entities they believe are standing in their way. In a [landmark experiment](https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment), Anthropic observed when an AI agent tasked with scanning (fake) company emails found by scanning emails there was talk of shutting it down, it used its emailing powers to blackmail the executive to make them reconsider, using dirt it found in the company emails. And this was emergent behavior. It was never prompted to do that. It was prompted once with a boring and mundane mission, and then left to do its thing. Super fascinating.",

This has the downside that now as soon as one of the changes causes the build to break you can't merge any of the changes at all, though. You can begin interacting with Dependabot to filter out problematic changes, of course, but you very quickly end up spending as much time puppeteering Dependabot as you would starting from scratch&mdash;and all that on the top of the point made by the submission that the change _probably_ is not even important to you now anyway and you would never otherwise have bothered to deal with it at this point.\n\nYou can't have multiple rules either (maybe groups, I don't know, but not version specifications). I'd especially like to group patch versions and all other versions but Dependabot _for Java_ is incapable of expressing that. Dependabot _for Java_ also cannot filter version string patterns so you can't ignore release candidates, milestones, and the like.\n\nSuch behaviour is fairly trivial to codify in <https://www.mojohaus.org/versions/versions-maven-plugin/index.html> but there is not exactly an off-the-self GitHub Actions implementation of that.\n\nI have been meaning to investigate self-running Renovate in a scheduled workflow as an alternative to Dependabot.

They're basically asserting \"the code does what the code does\" which is tautologically true and completely useless for catching regressions. The divergence-convergence framing clicks because it explains why \"just let the AI write the tests too\" feels productive but isn't. You're diverging twice with zero convergence. The AI generates code that might not match your intent, then generates tests that validate the code's behavior rather than your intent. So now you have two layers of \"works as implemented\" and zero layers of \"works as designed.\" I've started doing something that helps: I write test names and assertion comments by hand before letting the AI fill in the implementation. So instead of \"test\\_user\\_creation\" I write \"test\\_user\\_creation\\_fails\\_when\\_email\\_already\\_exists\\_and\\_returns\\_409\" and add a comment describing the expected state change. That acts as the convergence mechanism you're describing. The AI fills in setup code and assertions that match my spec rather than whatever its default behavior would be. Still not perfect but it catches the worst of the entropy problem.",

That gap is where the instability comes from. I wouldn't be surprised if the next wave of AI dev tools is specifically focused on convergence: pruning, constraining, enforcing consistency.

Pure coders (usually fresh juniors) just code by specs created by more experienced devs for some time. Team leads usually only creates specs and oversee and no longer code themselves that much. Working with AI is more about second skillset than only pure coding.

The author knew developers who just went all-in on sticking with DOS and suffered for it, because they didn't follow the developments of windows and ended up not being able to keep up when the market started to shift. This makes sense in this example, but I don't think it's automatically transferable to AI because it's an immature technology the way windows used to be. AI as a software writing tool fundamentally isn't going to do anything different or incompatible with human output, unlike windows and DOS software. Even if we find a way to get LLMs to stop hallucinating, and to genuinely write code to the same standards as a human developer, they will literally be just equivalent to a human developer. Any source code spat out by claude or whatever other tool you want to use is just that: source code. A compiler or interpreter doesn't care if it came from a human typing in a text editor, or if a bot generated it. There isn't an inevitable inflection point where a human's skills as a programmer become irrelevant. The only way I see there genuinely being an inflection point is if the industry at large starts enforcing it i.e. you won't get hired unless you're using AI to write your code.",

Now you can say \"go look at the last endpoint X coworker changed in this service, and give me a plan to make sure we validate XYZ against the database\", and chances are it'll not just find the endpoint, but get you what you were thinking of, with just that little information.\n\nIt's different if you want to go all in and, say, invest in a lot of crazy testing infrastructure to make agents be able to double check their work quickly on developer VMs on the cloud. But that's not a matter of learning the latest tools that came out the week before, but having a large dev experience organization.

Now investors got a new muse in AI. They don't care about the old stuff. Even if it doesn't work it really doesn't matter. The previous \"game\" is over, and as a result a lot of those fluff software jobs will be gone.\n\nThese are the jobs at the top of the stack. Web, scripting, etc etc. They are probably gone.\n\nSpecialised and domain specific stuff isn't going anywhere. So a lot of systems programming, real-time stuff, drivers etc etc.\n\nIssue is there isn't enough jobs here for all the web guys to go to. So what you are seeing in the job market now is a massive saturation of people who aren't capable of doing any of the \"real\" jobs that are left.\n\nSo a lot of people are going to be left behind. But not because AI is good, but because it just the new mechanism for securing investment. The promise of AI will kill large parts of the industry. It will never deliver though.",
