They mention at one point that the banks their standards cover are required to be synchronized to within 100 nanoseconds for their transactions. That must have been a fun undertaking to implement at a global scale.\n\n\nThey didn't mention time much at all back in the '80's when I was in college. Given how much of a problem it is, I feel like more attention needed to be devoted to it. I don't know what they teach the kids these days, though.\n\n\nI'd say it's not rocket science, but there are plenty of examples of rocket science being screwed up by bad time handling. One of the engineers at a satellite imagery company I used to work at used to tell a story about how he accidentally  ran some maneuvers from his Linux account instead of the system one they usually used. He had his timezone set to a something other than the GMT one the system used (Just the TZ environment variable in his login info,) and so he ended up rotating the satellite so its solar panels weren't facing the sun. They did manage to fix it, but it took 3 days to get it back to completely normal. The same company couldn't do imaging over the international date line because it would crash processes in the ground system.\n\n\nThere are a lot of take-aways from that story, the main one being that if you're looking for real estate for your fortress of eviltude, right on the international dateline is a good spot to consider.",

Our management team told them this was drastic and they we would make sure that nothing happened to their system during those times.\"\n\nI was managing a QA team at the time and I was told that we needed to test it.  The majority of the work had to be done by IT, to set up an environment for us where the clocks wouldn't automatically reset to the correct time.  Once they did that, the testing was trivial: we just set the clock to two hour before the clock change, ran the system for four hours, and verified that nothing bad happened.  \n\nManagement had the team perform this test *eleven* times.  All eleven times, the system ran fine without any problems.  Then they told the development teams to review the entire code base and evaluate every usage of dates and times to make sure that no problem could occur.  The teams all went through their code and concluded that there was nowhere in the code that could be affected by the clock change.  All told, we put several hundred hours into this.\n\nManagement then told the customer that nothing would happen to their system during those times, as long as they shut down production completely on the nights when the clocks were going to change.",

That didn't always mean it was worth your time, as anyone who's fallen for a u/shittymorph post knows, but it was at least more likely than your average typo-ridden run-on CAPSLOCK-ENABLED garbage that showed someone either made zero effort, or had zero education, or both.\n\nAnd if it turned into a debate, at least there was some symmetry of effort. Sure, the Gish Gallop was always a thing, but at a basic level, if I put in some real effort tearing apart some well-presented-but-baseless argument, they'd have to put some effort into their response to at least *appear* to be holding their own. If they immediately descend into name-calling, then it's a lot more obvious that there wasn't much to that initial post. (Maybe it was just copypasta.)\n\nLLMs broke that entirely. They even turned it on its head: Now, the cleaner your syntax and prose, the more that's an indication of a *lack of* effort. From the article, one of the hallmarks of a machine-generated submission is:\n\n> Variables and functions named with an eerie, sterile perfection that no human programmer running on caffeine and zero sleep has ever achieved.\n\nThat's right, code that reads *too clearly* looks low-effort. `foo` and `bar` are the new clean code? ...well, no, not really. Proper spelling and grammar are still expected. But the lowest-effort slop looks a lot more like the highest-effort, highest-quality code (or prose).\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, like you see all over this thread, plenty of actually-good people are starting to use LLMs for at least *some* of what they're doing, whether they want to or not. My employer mandates Claude Code.\n\nThat's why this sucks so much for these maintainers: It's not just the sheer volume of extra stuff to review, it's that all the normal ways of filtering low-effort submissions have stopped working.",

It takes much longer to recognize that they are bad because:\n\n1. They are usually longer, because LLMs have no issue generating walls of text.\n2. If you ask the \"author\" to change something, they'll just feed your comments to the LLM - which will see it as an opportunity to other things, not just what you asked to change. So you have to read everything again.\n3. LLMs are really good at disguising how bad their output is.\n\nI want to focus on that last point. Neural networks can get very very good at what you train them to do, but the ones that became a synonym with \"AI\" are the ones that are easy for the end user to use because they were trained at the art of conversation - the Large Language Models.\n\nWhen you learn a language from reading text in it, you also gain some knowledge about the subject of that text. And thus, when learning language, the LLMs also learned various things. With the vast resources invested in training them, these \"various things\" added up to a very impressive curriculum. But the central focus of the GPT algorithm is still learning how to talk - so with more training this ability will grow faster than any other ability.\n\nThis means that if the relevant \"professional training\" of the LLM fails to provide a correct answer to your request - a smooth talk training, orders of magnitude more advanced, kicks in and uses the sum of compute power capitalism could muster to coax you into believing whatever nonsense the machine came up with instead.\n\nA human programmer that sends you a bad PR is probably not a world class conman.

It is not reasonable to expect me to fix someone's lack of intrinsic motivation or impostor syndrome: I have no training or interest in being someone's unpaid therapist. It is not reasonable to expect me to teach a CS 101 course in my spare time: glib quotes aside, mastery of a subject does not replace years of learning about pedagogy, and it's a disservice to everyone involved to pretend that a busy senior SWE is going to intuit the fundamentals in their spare time. But you see both of those and similar expectations routinely in discussions around mentorship: in replies to this topic, in blogs, in people complaining about how their mentors didn't magically make them 10x engineers and fix all of their mental health problems.",

I put zero effort into this.\n\nOther people required tiny bits of guidance every now and then, and often taught me cool new things along the way.\n\nAll my best mentors would give me very basic guidance as to why they were going to do a thing, and made sure I would see them do that thing. I could then appreciate what they were doing so much better.\n\nI learned from one guy the differences between management and leadership. He told me that managing client expectations was my primary job along with protecting my team from the executive.\n\nHe showed me that you mostly manage processes at factories. But people need to be lead. They need a vision to follow. This included the clients and the executive. They have to buy into the vision. You don't badger them into accepting the vision, but they all have to internalize it.\n\nThen, people largely can self manage as they are able to filter their own decisions through that vision. As a leader, you just monitor to see that people aren't modifying or straying from the vision. \n\nDeveloping the vision is a team effort, and modifying as makes sense is as well. \n\nMicromanagers complain about \"herding cats.\"; a sure sign they are a terrible terrible manager. Leaders have the cats follow them.\n\nBut, this is where my best mentor pointed out. If you have cats which won't follow you, is it because they are so smart they know a better place to go. Or, are they just aholes? If the latter fire them, if the former, reexamine your vision.\n\nI learned this very well.

If only one person understands a system, that’s a liability, not excellence.\n\nIn short: a good coder can produce great code alone.

An evaluation process without defined standards tends to become a biased process, whether that’s actual discrimination or just the sort of popularity contest that takes more notice of some people’s accomplishments than others. Also, as some people have already noted, if mentorship is not recorded as work, then you’ve got to pull a full load of recorded work on top of the mentorship, which just punishes your mentors.\n\nSo I understand the reasons for formalizing processes, particularly when not doing so entails some legal risk, but that unavoidably ends in a one-size process by which there is only one officially approved way to excel at your job, and one which trades *inadvertently* ignoring some contributions for *explicitly* ignoring contributions that do not tick a box somebody previously thought to include on a list while also requiring things that might not make sense for every individual. Not everybody on your staff needs to be a blogger or a maintainer of an open source repository, for instance.\n\nIf you squint at these formal processes you can tell yourself that the right person will *automatically* tick all those boxes and that those requirements represent values you wish to promote. In practice it reminds me of that story where the Air Force designed a cockpit around the mathematical average of every pilot in the service and ended up with an airplane that fit nobody.\n\nOn one hand you’ve got to fairly and consistently recognize people for what they do, which does not happen by good will and wishing alone. On the other hand, a one-size standard just does not reflect the nature of people, and people who are working to check a box are less effective at that than doing whatever comes naturally to them. I am not remotely claiming to have a solution to this dilemma, but constantly reminding ourselves it *is* a dilemma is more humane than installing some technocratic ass-covering regime and calling it a day.",

Note - I don’t have brain to read the full article and I’m reacting purely to the title here. \n\nTeaching a concept well takes the ability to understand a subject _so_ well that you can distill it and communicate it to a variety of different learning styles. It’s a combination of depth of technical understanding and communication skills. You have to communicate to your audience while also knowing the subject matter enough to perform that translation on the fly. \n\nAt the same time, software engineering at its basic level is taking a concept and communicating that to a computer using a specific and specialized language. Passable engineers can do this in a single language. Better engineers can do this in multiple languages. The best can do this in programming languages and human languages.",

              "text": "The article is written in three steps: 1) senior engineers never learned to mentor and because they're so swamped they substitute good mentorship with, \"how's it going?\", 2) when an engineer gets past that point and try to be a good mentor and listen, typically they mire themselves in explaining technical concepts and deciding between X and Y for a specific problem (you might called this the \"giving a fish rather than teaching to fish\" concept), then 3) there is a blind area where a mentee just doesn't see the things they need to see to ask about like \"how do I deal with an ambiguous problem or effectively scope and estimate a task?\"\n\nThe point is that mentorship is about teaching how to deal with the complexities of problem solving in engineering outside of basic technical principles. I've seen this over and over in all these senior- / staff-level interviews I do; people don't know how to think about problems and system design effectively. Presented with an ambiguous problem or badly stated problem, they're always grasping for a solution they've already seen and it's blatantly obvious. Even amongst people who clearly have had to design a complex solution to a hard problem, lead a project, and have 8-10 years of experience, I can be surprised because all the most basic guides on doing interviews try to teach the principles that I'm about to lay out. Specifically, asking clarifying questions, laying out multiple possible solutions and considering their pros and cons, eliciting feedback from a larger group of technical experts (your interviewers), thinking about project management and communication, etc. These are things that a mentor should be teaching, but I digress.\n\nThe fundamental point in the title which is really bait is that just because you are exceptional at technical solutions doesn't mean you have the capacity to teach someone how to figure out technical problems on their own or pass on technical knowledge. It's just a fundamentally different skill. Sure, it helps to have experience and understand a technical idea in sufficient depth.  \n  \nWhen I was a TA in undergrad, I had the opportunity to work with a lot of people who were varying degrees of clever and varying degrees of good at mentorship. The more hardcore someone was about performing well, often the less a damn they gave about teaching. PhDs were often happy to just give solutions because they had better things to do with their time (research) without actually helping you grasp the concept. I would spend an hour with students who I knew were on the margin in a course because I cared about their desire to actually learn the concepts. I once took a class far outside my capacity and I went to the professor's office hour to give up and get his approval to drop the class. This is a professor that, together with another professor, defined an entire new field of mathematics now considered a branch of studies on par with applied math, pure math, etc. You could say he was the brightest, most technically talented. He stopped me from dropping the course and was willing to sit through every office hour then on to basically repeat what he did in class. I landed with the second highest grade on the final. Point being: technical skill and mentorship being completed divorced abilities that need to be trained and passed on.\n\nBut, the thing I would argue that is disingenuous about the title is the suggestion that the best engineers shouldn't be good mentors. The field has grown manifoldly generation after generation and the reality is that it is imperative for every generation to learn the skill of mentorship and pass on good practices or we're left with underdeveloped engineers building spaghetti crud with programming languages lacking robustness through vibe coding, a viper pit of vulnerable, cruft fattened from hundreds of layers of frameworks resting upon each other like a stack of dried out sticks in a Californian autumn.",

We followed a pattern where assigned work was always done in pairs, and innovation work was solo. It was budgeted at about a 50/50 split (reality was often different, but that was the goal).

The other one is previously worked on surface level on a fully developed system, she can do things in structured & standardised way. But, she is not good at debugging & analysis - and sometimes she can't even find the cause of bugs. But, she is a quick learner and learning things fast. So, I am happy with the team.\n\nI also mentoring another team of 4 developers on NestJS - React - Flutter. The developers are working in intern positions & paid very low. SO, their commitments are horrible. But, the flutter developer is good - and she is a fast learner. Also, the senior MERN developer is good - he is the most paid guy - and he is faster. But, there are other two MERN guys - they can't catch up things. There are other 6 testers - 3 of them are seniors - one of them is paid. Their testing is in an average level. Other 3 of them are interns - Their work also ok. On the above of all - There is a project coordinator - she also good - and she works as client support too. Even though mentoring that team (3 MERN developers, 1 Flutter Developer, 6 Testers, 1 Project Coordinator) is a pain - I took that a challenge.\n\nSo, as of my experience, \"Are you good mentor question & are you enjoying it question\" are highly tied to the behaviour of the team you are mentoring. It also varies time to time (according to the progress of the team). In a painful environment - all we can do is try our best.\n\nAnother thing to mention here is: The management of first company is really cool. They understand well & supports well. But, the second one is horrible. they things like coding is a cheap skill, any one can do with a bunch of AI tools. And the developers are very cheap - they don't have to paid at all.

It might sound cynical, but really it's really no different than a teenager's angry anti-government post in the sense that it is only touching the problem at the surface level while missing the underlying cause.\n\nThe biggest reason it's so hard for engineers to compromise is because a lot of engineers effectively *require* that any communication with them, especially as it pertains to the product, must happen using their preferred terminology, ideas, and presentation style. Anyone that can't do that is seen like a lesser being, perhaps a minor insult like \"QA\" or the ultimate insult; \"user.\"\n\nThe secret is to explain thing to people not using your language, but using *their* language. Most people you work with genuinely want to do a good job, it's just that they also have their own constraints and requirements. Fortunately, if you actually get them talking you might find that some of these requirements are more aspirational, while others are set in stone. Then it's a lot more easier to negotiate when you know what is and isn't possible.\n\nIt's a lot easier to \"do better\" when you've talked to what everyone thinks \"better\" is.\n\nHowever, one thing that absolutely *will* harm your chances is if you approach these people with too much cynicism. Instead what they want to see is several well thought-out options, and the costs and benefits of each outlined clearly. This isn't an idealist or a cynic document. Just a professional one. Figure out how the people you need to influence think, then figure out how you can shift that without annoying them or wasting too much time. This is purely a question of communication skill, and how well you understand a target audience.",

Mistakes aren't just bugs, they can also be bad decisions like UX, or misunderstanding requirements. Taking critical thinking out of the earliest part of the process may be offset by pushing bug discovery to later, where it's more expensive.\n* We spend 80% of our dev time on maintenance, not the initial creation.\n* Even when creating and maintaining, code review and coming to agreement is typically the bottleneck, moreso than writing the code.\n\nWhere the LLMs can help us iterate faster, we do get an improvement. Or, as many have said, proof-of-concept code, or code that is highly memorization-based or heavy on boilerplate (like CI/CD pipelines), or places where we need something but we don't need to care about quality. It has a place in the toolbelt. Maybe they solve the \"junior engineer\" problem - but in a way that cuts off a pathway for juniors to become seniors, punting a now problem to be a future problem.\n\nIn fact, re: bullet #3 and the code review pipeline being the bottleneck - we are seeing open source projects start to turn off accepting PRs because LLMs can generate at a volume that cannot be sustained by review. That is in fact *exacerbating* our problems, not solving them.\n\nAnd I don't think LLMs will be a panacea for code review, either. I do not believe that LLMs have found a hack or cheat that gets around Rice's theorem. There's still no evidence that we'll get above 90% confidence without spending *so much* energy that profit for the AI providers is impossible.

Unfortunately, the clients are all very busy and can't/won't/don't devote enough time to validating and approving items, so I often find myself twiddling my thumbs.

Claude is excellent at doing a well written, direct, 1 point ticket.\n\nIf we can change how we structure or work to have a lot of 1 point tickets, that can be a large speedup. Even something as simple as adding an empty stub for a new route, and then empty stubs for the tests, can save 20 minutes. The next ticket can be just a DB migration to add a table. The next ticket can be to add an insert to that for the DB layer. The next is some verification … and so on.\n\nThe point being individually these is really simple. When you have 20 minutes saved * 6 tickets, that’s suddenly half your day saved.\n\nI think what’s key is people know exactly what they want, before they go to the LLM. Not *’go fix this bug’* type stuff.",

If each part of the task must be separately coordinated with each other part, the effort increases as n(n-1)/2. Three workers require three times as much pairwise intercommunication as two; four require six times as much as two. If, moreover, there need to be conferences among the three, four, etc., workers to resolve things jointly, matters get worse yet. The added effort of communicating may fully counteract the division of the original task and bring us to the situation of Fig 2.4.\n\n> Since software construction is inherently a systems effort -- an exercise in complex interrelationships -- communication effort is great, and it quickly dominates the decrease in individual task time brought about by partitioning. Adding more men then lengthens, not shortens, the schedule.\n\nWhile this was written more than 50 years ago, and was written in the context about how adding more people to a late project makes it later, the highlighting of the impact of communication applies more broadly in software development and still rings true today.",

The periodicity of integration decayed exponentially and unpredictably as you approached the root so it ended up that it took between 1 and 3 months for my code to get to the root node, and some multiple of that for it to reach the other nodes. It should be noted too that the only common ancestor that my team, the shell team, and the kernel team shared was the root.\n>\n> ...\n> The end result of all this is what finally shipped: the lowest common denominator, the simplest and least controversial option.",

I get it, juniors can ask dumb questions that slow things down but good company culture can help get new folks coached and moving in-step with the whole team. Shutting out juniors from early design decisions is ludicrous because those early decisions are where the overall shape of the project is chiseled out. Once the seniors are done coding up the initial implementation, it's now on the shoulders of the juniors to start at this inexplicable code-blob and \"learn\". Learn *what*?! If anything, learning to infer the intent of code just by looking at it is a skill you pick up over the years, so we end up putting things exactly backwards... senior devs doing initial coding, and juniors \"fixing bugs\".

Think of a recent significant project or piece of work your team completed (ideally over a period of months). How long did it take, end to end, inception to delivery? Now imagine you were to do the same project over again, with the same team, the same organizational constraints, the same everything, except your team would already know everything they learned during the project. How long would it take you the second time, all the way through? Stop now and try it.  \n> It turned out answers in the order of 1/2 to 1/4 the time to repeat the project were not uncommon.

It'd be better for competition, it'd be fair to FOSS authors - hell, it could actually fund the knowledge they create - and it'd be less destructive to the economy (read: economy, not stock market) which objectively isn't seeing material benefits from this technology.

That filter hasn't changed.\n\nWhat I do think is a genuine problem is the signal-to-noise ratio. Package registries are getting flooded with low-effort packages that wrap existing functionality with AI-generated code and AI-generated READMEs. Makes it harder to find the actually maintained stuff. npm already had this problem before AI, but it's definitely accelerating.\n\nThe maintainer burnout angle is worth watching too. If people start submitting AI-generated PRs to real projects that look reasonable but have subtle issues, that's more review burden on already-stretched maintainers.

Much like we were told nuclear was a threat .. but eventually we embraced nuclear energy to offset other energy forms because of the density; IMHO vibe coding is in the same vein.  There will be adjustments and we're all gonna have to get used to that model of development.  \n\nCompanies that *provide* software have a more threatened model IMHO because many things they could write that others couldn't .. can now be written.  So say licensing a tool that does $foo costs many 10K .. and yet you can ask an AI to write the same software and get an 80/20 result with even mediocre ROI is impressive .. and that's only gonna get better.\n\nI think as we continue to explore what it means to have an OSS tool that you've maintained over the years.. and now others can make changes to on their own time w/o having to involve the maintainers ... it will change the paradigm.   \n\nConsider i have too $bar that does this Thing(tm) .. but doesn't exactly solve my problem; and there's resistance to the implementation of the solution.  I can take some $$ and an AI and say \"go add $feature to $bar for my needs\".  The result may or may not be production ready, fit the original design model or have the support the original did; but it satisfies a need that wouldn't have been possible before. \n\nPromoting *any* product is going to have to evolve to talk about WHY their version is better than what can be coded upon or around it.  That selling point will have to be cogent and impactful; and AFAICS I havn't heard one that will be either for MBMA managers that read about the new AI revolution. \n\nIMHO the wins for any software provider will be:\n\n * managing complexity across the entire toolset ( as AI suffers here still ) \n * supportability and responsiveness to issues \n * training and good knowledge transfer \n * feature management relative to design goals\n\nAs examples.  But we're in the early stages and it's only going to accelerate.",

That's the part that's \"finally here\".\n\nThe comment about adaptive/prunable dictionaries is interesting too — that would essentially be streaming dictionary updates via delta hashing, roughly how rsync's rolling checksum works.

That's great for content that's mostly similar, but doesn't change the size of the original payload. I wonder if the browser vendors could take the HTML/CSS/JS/etc. files for the top thousand sites over the last decade, train a set of dictionaries on that, and pre-include those in the browser and the server. This of course would require finding the sweet spot between savings vs the size of the dictionary itself. The dictionary itself might become unoptimal over time as development trends shift, e.g. if everyone starts using a newer keyword frequently or a new framework like Tailwind that changes the characteristics of the code. Still, that could result in a general compression benefit web-wide as long as servers are updated for it.",

Then WebAssembly was actually shipped in browsers and I discovered that you still have to use JS if you want to interact with browser APIs in any meaningful way.  \n  \nI fully appreciate that developing an entirely new language for the web is a monumental task, and that a compiled language makes sense to target high-performance scenarios, but for most of us plebs writing run-of-the-mill websites this new proposal is what we have wanted all along. The fact I could (if I was clever enough) write real time ray-traced games that run in the browser is mind-blowing, but it's not something that I would ever get to do in my day job. All I want is to be able to write functions that interact with the dom AND guarantee that the arguments passed to them are actually going to be numbers and not null, an array of objects, or a string that the interpreter will try very hard to assign a numeric value to, because it's only trying to help and having some value is better than throwing an error, no?",

It practically was wasm, but in JS syntax.\n\nWhat it didn't have was an ABI because you already were in a JS context, so if you wanted to call some DOM method you could just do that. Then the whole thing got upgraded to wasm and people started to think about ABI but it was deemed too complex for an MVP, so the old \"here's a flat region of memory that's how you'll communicate\" is what we got.\n\nIt's been years and years and I haven't looked at the component model for a while but I guess it's getting ready for prime time.\n\nOn the flipside, though, integration already exists. If you're writing your wasm in e.g. rust the end-user code will stay the same when switching from the old stuff to components because from the code perspecive, it's all just rust library functions, no matter how they're implemented or by which mechanism they get called.\n\nWhat this actually enables is better cross-language integration, that is, linking different languages into one wasm module, as well as getting rid of the JS integration, and then finally implementing JS on top of wasm. There's work going on regarding interacting with garbage-collected memory from the wasm side to make that work, wouldn't make sense to have the GC running inside the wasm runtime, especially not multiple GCs from different dynamic language runtimes running inside the runtime. Plus the GC that the browser needs in one way or the other anyway to manage the DOM.\n\n---\n\nThat all said, I have a pet peeve: Non-hosted sites. Things like twine VNs distributed as html files and a folder full of images. If you want to use wasm in those you have two options, launch a webserver instead of using `file://`, or compress your wasm, base-encode it into the html file as a string, and load it as a binary blob, which is ludicrous (but works). Browsers won't load \"external\" wasm files from `file://` URL because CORS policy because don't ask me why. There ought to be something simple, like just put everything in a zip file and rename it to `.webapp`, that allows you to bundle these kinds of projects and not need a webserver. That zip file would also be a great place to put LocalStorage in.",

We all stopped writing Java because we don't want to have to churn out that kind of boilerplate.  This kind of thing gives me lfashbacks to writing JNI shims by hand back around y2k.\n\nwasm needs a native interface to the browser APIs.  It's such an obvious, obvious idea and yet the reaction is consistently either \"we can't imagine a use-case for that, just use javascript\" or \"you need a javascript shim to do that\".  For people whose whole world is javascript, they just can't imagine why someone would want to avoid javascript wholesale.\n\nIn a way, the situation is similar to JNI.  There are tools being gradually improved that do all the work for you.  But in this case, it all seems so unnecessary.  I still don't understand why WASM can't just have a native interface to the APIs.\n\nETA: Having now read the article, it seems like a whole bunch of steps in the right direction.  But some of the problems are really fundamental and the article seems to ignore them.  Making wasm able to interface to browser APIs directly without JS code in the middle is definitely a step in the right direction, removing one paradigm-shifting interface.  But it's not obvious to me that that translates directly into \"now I can write browser front-end in any language\".  There is still a paradigm-shift that has to be accommodated.  For instance, one of the examples from the article would let a Rust program import a web API like this:\n\n    package std:web;\n    \n    interface console {\n      log: func(msg: string);\n      ...\n    }\n\nBut what is this `string` we are using here?  That works well for Rust strings, which, like JavaScript strings, store the string length alongside the string content.  But it doesn't work so well for lots of other languages that use C-style null-terminated strings.  Such a language will always have to either reallocate strings coming from the web APIs to accommodate a null terminator or just not use their own native string types.  There will be other similar fundamental differences in the models of languages that mean you can't just compile them to wasm and magically use browser APIs.",

The agent run uses subagent (orchestrator with planner, implementer, reviewer, tester).\n\nThe review step is a 3-model (sometimes more) summary to get different “opinions”.\n\nAll the context is saved in the repo - plans, chats, docs, references, skills, agent definitions.\n\nPeople work in parallel via worktrees to do multiple changes at once. Neither the reasoning nor the diffs are paid attention to.\n\nNon engineers are making changes to the product. There are no product or design artefacts in the traditional sense. It’s all markdown with diagrams that are fed as context.\n\nThe older stacks are getting fully rewritten (go, protos, microservices, db) to be typescript sql monoliths to move as fast as possible.\n\nTechnical discussions aren’t held because rolling back an architectural change is done via unleashing the agents for an hour. To do or not to do something is answered by summaries pasted back and forth in slack.\n\nIt hasn’t been very fun to work this way for someone deeply technical. People however who see code as means to an end adore this.\n\nIn a sense the craft might be dead. The above is still engineering but in quite a different way. I’m in early stages of founding a company and some investors have expectations about the above. “Building is so fast” is a common phrase I hear.\n\nI’ve never worked in corporate so I don’t know how far behind this wave is, nor have I embraced it but there are more than a few organisations running like this.",

This is a big problem with protobuf generated code, which there's a big stack of when you get into certain ecosystems (and a weirdly huge amount of `envoy` stuff).\n\nI'd love it if Go could do something about this, although the most practical answer is probably for protobuf to improve the quality of code it generates.",

Think about the \"safe withdrawal ratio\" and extend the timeline out from an oft-cited 30-year period to a longer period (define \"permanently\" - a hundred years?) and increase the assessed risk when running the model. Same math anyone does when setting up a trust with a large endowment in order to fund something in the long-term or as close to perpetuity as they can reasonably ask for -- when you're dead, you can't really vet the fund manager to make sure he's not incompetent or a crook, you do the best you can with rules the trust has to legally follow, and hope it works out, and hope that if there are troubles people will donate to up the funds.\n\nThe oft-cited 4% withdrawal ratio doesn't work for funding designed to be \"in perpetuity.\" You're probably talking more like 2%.\n\nSo if you want to pay (eg) 10 programmers full-time, salary and benefits, and you figure you can get some good folk at below market rate (by US standards) because they believe in the mission, you're talking what, maybe $2m per year so $100m endowment. $100m endowment for a modestly-sized software project is huge sums of money. And that's ignoring the need to pay for other stuff like lawyers, accountants and asset managers and tax guys, auditors, PR guys to raise more money, etc; even a super \"minimal overhead\" endowment that doesn't keep any of those people on permanent staff will still need to occasionally pay them for work. And then note that that endowment and withdrawal ratio wouldn't even remotely come close to paying for everyone needed to work on something huge like - using popular examples we're all familiar with - like the linux kernel, but hell, it wouldn't even pay for something much more limited in scope like git.",

[The OSI definition of open source](https://opensource.org/osd) (which is as close as you can get to a canonical definition) runs counter to your claim, as it does hold the ability to modify, distribute and derive from the original source as crucial. \n\nIt's why the Commons clause is criticized for making software no longer \"**open** source\"",

The pricing of RDS is about x4 the price of the same reserved EC2, and if you pay that much there is definitely a way to greatly lower those costs. Even if it's just using the main in RDS and the other ephemeral databases in EC2s or something else, there is definitely a way to be found.

You're just trading one black box for another. If you didn't understand the intent behind the code, you sure as hell won't understand the shiny new classes the AI just created. You've just swapped a single, messy black box for a set of smaller, prettier black boxes. The underlying business logic is still a mystery. And now I have to click around on the IDE to jump to different functions. Minus points if the LLM used some shiny OOP pattern that also abstracts codes into 10 different files.\n2. AI optimizes for syntax, not for human comprehension. When I refactor code, I'm telling a story. I'm trying to guide the next developer's mental model: \"Data comes in here, gets processed, this if statement handles that one weird legacy edge case, and the output is here.\" Claude refactoring can be beautiful, but it just doesn't tell a story that sticks. If it doesn't stick it's more tech debt than the original code.\n3. The premise is a paradox. The only way for an AI to do a truly great refactor is for it to rewrite the class from scratch. But that requires two things that are often harder than the refactoring itself: 1) Perfectly articulating 20 years of unwritten business logic, political decisions, and historical context into a prompt, and 2) Having a \"perfect\" set of unit tests to validate it!",

Have you noticed though that when you ask it for something you *do* know a lot about, what you get back is often superficial, misleading, or flat out wrong?\"\n\nThe point is hopefully obvious to most: AI consistently gives you stuff that looks plausible, but not necessarily true and generally of lesser value than what an expert can do. (And no this isn't going to magically go away with AI advances, because the data LLMs have been trained on is of variable quality. AI cannot evaluate quality or truth, the best it can theoretically do is give you a sort of average of that data.) So for anything where quality and accuracy matters, you need an expert to supervise the AI. The question isn't whether it can take their jobs, the question is how or whether it makes them better or faster at their jobs.\n\nUnfortunately it turns out the point isn't obvious to one kind of person: the person who asks AI about things they *think* they know a lot about, but actually don't, and are therefore always impressed.",

          "text": "Starts off strong, but very quickly falls into the same trap as many other such articles.\n\nTo start off, this list is mistaken:\n\n> 1. Big bosses — CEOs and such of companies used to hire programmers.\n> 2. General public.\n> 3. Programmers.\n\nThere are actually 4 distinct groups:\n\n> 1. Big bosses — CEOs and such of companies used to hire programmers.\n> 2. General public.\n> 3. Programmers that do not understand ML\n> 4. Programmers that DO understand ML\n\nYou described Big bosses and the general public accurately, but you missed the final distinction.\n\nMost people that you refer to as \"vibe coders\" fall into group 3. It's essentially the people trying to use an AI like a person. Also in group 3 are people that seem to think the only valid use for AI is trivial translation and research tasks. Essentially the unifying theme; to people like this \"AI\" is a black box that you can treat as a singular object. It's something you use, and then you stop and do something else.\n\nOn the other hand, programmers that do understand machine learning treat AI tools like any other tool or lib that is omnipresent in our lives. I'm never just \"using an LLM,\" just like I'm never just using \"glibc,\" or just using \"linux,\" or just using \"python.\" These are all just tools that are constantly active. I might refer to them directly sometimes, but even if I'm doing something totally unrelated they are still there facilitating operations.\n\nIt's not too different with ML. During the course of work I might be using any number of LLMs, classifiers, embedders, filters, processors, and transformers, all as individual tools that facilitate my work. It's rarely just one either. I might have multiple tasks going in the background at once as I review and validate the results of one. It's about understanding how to use your effect effectively.\n\nAs part of it I am constantly making decisions about things like how much to review (a test needs much less attention than auth code), and conversely, how much time to spend before implementation to plan out the entire thing (If it knows exactly what files to change, and how to change them, it's far less likely to make uninformed changes) . For instance, the idea that LLM code needs to be refactored (well, all code really. Would you ever actually ship your first draft?) is pretty well known, so at the very least you probably shouldn't be reviewing your code until you've had the LLM iterate over it a few times with an eye towards cleanup, refactoring, and normalising the code to your style (which you've obviously described in extensive detail for the AI in your docs, right?)\n\nThe challenge here is that none of this is obvious or implicit. If you don't understand that you must take on all these extra tasks to make AI development effective... Well, then you just won't be effective. Then when scientists are studying simplify it all down to a simple soundbite (no gains in performance when using a tool that takes many years to fully master, a couple of years after that tool's release). \n\nIt's also where you get the people thinking that just because an AI can write code now that makes them software engineers. Software engineering isn't \"writing code,\" that's just being a code monkey. A software engineer understands why software is designed the way it is, and can make informed decisions about the structures and abstractions that a codebase will need not just tomorrow, but also in two years. This is why the most senior devs and engineers have always spent more time in meetings than at the keyboard. The meetings is where the hard stuff with no clear answers gets solved. The keyboard is where the technical challenges with an obvious solution you haven't found yet get solved. One of those is actually much harder.\n\nAn AI will happily make generic, uninformed decisions about your codebase if you let it, and your task as the person doing the development is to not let it do that.\n\n> Some programmers report (I am one of them, honestly) that they lost the fun of coding and the feeling of a “flow”.\n\nI find this has more to do with how much you're learning, and how challenging it is, rather than how exciting the profession is. As you master a profession, it will often stop being fun, because you will stop encountering projects that challenge you. With AI this is a very easy state to reach, because AI makes a lot of previously challenging tasks much easier. \n\nThis makes sense if you know anything about flow state though. Flow is a mix if skill and difficulty of a task. If a task is too simple, you will not enter a flow state. Obviously if you make a task easier, you will have trouble entering flow.\n\nThe solution is that is actually quite simple though. Take on more challenging tasks. Have the AI help you understand fields you don't understand at all, but have always wanted to. Use it to write code in totally new environments, doing things you've never done before. Start projects that have always seemed too impossible and too insurmountable to even start. It's quite easy to regain that bright-eyed excitement when you're exploring a totally new realm that you thought was denied to you.\n\nAs an example, I did not really need an AI driven home assistant box capable of tracking me across all my camera, parsing voice from any of them in order to respond to my requests, and I most certainly didn't need to design my own PoE powered box pi5 ML inference box, and I absolutely didn't need to do fluid dynamics simulations to track how the air would flow in that box. I could have just bought one of the stupid pre-made assistant boxes, or just bought a micro-PC and used that and spent far less time and money. I didn't though; instead I hammered at it for a while with AI, and now I have a 3D model generation scaffold, a fluid dynamics simulation environment, and nearly have a talking smart house that can operate even without internet. None of those were things I thought I'd reasonably be able to get to in this lifetime. All were, and continue to be really fun.",

Vibe coding - even using the definition you quoted - are about using code the developer haven't looked at. \n\nYour stance on Torvalds is about redefining \"the developer\" to \"a very senior developer\". Doesn't matter how senior someone is if they don't look at the code.\n\nI'm not saying that's what happened in Torvalds' case (haven't checked), but vibe coding is expressly about _not_ reviewing code, but rather just looking at the end product.

And it WILL break. AI-generated code often works perfectly for the happy path and then explodes on edge cases that the AI was not prompted about.\n\nWhere vibe coding is genuinely useful:\n- Quick internal tools nobody else will use\n- Prototyping to validate an idea before investing real engineering time\n- Boilerplate generation (CRUD endpoints, config files, test scaffolding)\n- Learning new frameworks by getting a working example to study\n\nWhere it will get you in trouble:\n- Production systems with real users\n- Anything involving security, payments, or sensitive data\n- Complex state management or concurrent systems\n\nUse AI to code faster.

Coz, there is no thinking process really, what we see on the screen is just a simulation.\n\nThis is my only issue with the article, and honestly, it's specific to DeepSeek. Even Gemini doesn't benefit much from \"thinking\" because it's an emulation. I've literally seen Gemini \"think\" incorrectly just to justify an incorrect answer.\n\nThe technique only works when it is designed as part of the model, and feeds *independently* back to evaluation steps. \n\nThe \"how many [letter]s in [word]\" test is telling. DeepSeek is the only model I have literally been unable to get a wrong answer from. Every other model makes weird mistakes, at least every once in a while. \n\nBut it goes to show how new the industry is, and frankly, how stupid. DeepSeek published a full white paper and their competition still can't implement it. Ironically, I implemented my own version with Gemini that seems to actually work quite well by reading their white paper and implementing it in code. Yet \"real\" \"thinking\" Gemini gives me some of the stupidest answers. I think it says something about the people building this stuff that a relative layman (me) built a tool on top of their own model, based on a freely accessible white paper, that outperforms their more expensive \"thinking\" model. And I mean *by a wide margin*.",

Last year AI programming was basically glorified intellisence. Now I activate \"yolo-mode\" in a github code space and tell the AI to just prototype all the features I can think of and check back what it built at the end of the day.\n\nFrom 2008 when I first got hired by EA, to 2025, I always recommended programming as a job to kids.

They are in essence an HCI that helps the computer understand the human's intent, and the human to keep track of what the computer thinks it's supposed to be doing.\n\nThat is no longer the case with vibe coding: if you use the _generated_ code as the HCI, it's still a 4GL. And if you use the _prompt_, there is no deterministic path from the prompt to the code. The same prompt doesn't yield the same code. Slight adjustments to the prompt don't yield a familiar, slightly changed code. It is therefore not practical for the human developer to actually stay in charge of the developed software. The developer cannot meaningfully do code review, and debugging and profiling become a lot harder, as they lack familiarity.",

It is in your interest.\n\nFirstly, very few people will have connections that can get them anything remotely useful to getting a good job. You may get some shittty job in your uncle’s business or even a nice job, just not in your area, and not really something you have any interest in. This is my experience as when I was younger it was incredibly hard to get jobs and we were forced to use this kind of alternatives to find something that paid the bills.\n\nSecondly, about juniors… sorry but why should my company hire a junior now and let them write code to learn how to code, even though AI can do it faster and better, when I know all too well that juniors are very likely to leave as soon as they have actually learned stuff and can now compete for jobs at companies that can pay much better than mine? I think the bigger companies will be the only ones who can afford to educate juniors, which means there will not be many who will make it… I do recognize that many years from now, this will cause a shortage of seniors, but on the other hand , we simply can’t predict the future, no one saw the current situation we’re in 10 years ago. So we need to act on what we can know, and by that reasoning it is not looking great for junior developers right now.\n\nMy company is currently taking temporary apprentices because we do want to help some young people get into the business, but from a pure business standpoint there is very little reason to hire them, unfortunately. As the article points out, AI can do a lot but a senior dev is needed to keep it on the right track, and that requires a lot of experience that will be next to impossible for juniors to obtain. It’s a hard question.",

          "text": "Overall, great article and I learned a lot. I just disagree with the conclusion.\n\nIsn't it also true that TEE doesn't prevent lower level kinds of copying as well? The CPU has to route the audio information to a piece of hardware and - presumably - a user could produce a piece of hardware which acts like a speaker, but functions like a recorder. So, while this DRM is easier to \"hack\", it serves basically the same purpose, no? A deterrent - as it is mentioned in the article.\n\nAnother example I've seen is HDMI splitters to record video output which is encrypted with TEE.\n\nUltimately I think this claim is where I have the most beef:\n\n>Real DRM, you know; the kind that requires a motivated attacker to invest serious time and expertise to defeat; lives in hardware TEEs and requires commercial licensing\n\nI just don't think it *does* require serious time to bypass media-based DRMs. DRMs that obfuscate complex code (like video games) are much harder to get around because you need to find ways to actually decrypt the source. But anything that produces a \"static\" product like images, videos, music, etc. are always going to be easily bypassed by simply moving the unencrypted bits into a piece of hardware/software you control and recording the unencrypted bits on that hardware (ie., recording signals across HDMI, audio cables, etc.). Because ultimately, all of these static products must interface with something a human can perceive - which leads to generic encodings that currently don't support encryption (god help us if they start integrating encryption into the full life cycle and Spotify only plays music on Spotify^(TM) headphones). \n\nThe author seems mostly like they're advocating *against* building DRMs in JavaScript, but they also counter their own argument too well. It's not to prevent hackers. It's to prevent the layperson. \n\n>I don’t think it works the way it’s intended to work but I suppose I cannot fault fermaw for wanting to create a solution for the ASMRtists who felt they needed it. \n\nI would say it is working the way it's intended. Again, I think the article is correct in most of its assertions, I just disagree with the conclusion.",

Original author does not understand the legal purpose of userland DRM.\n2. Author broke the law during his research and is liable for distribution of anti-circumvention technology.\n\nWhether or not it prevents copying by a determined attacker does not matter. What matters, legally, is that the content was protected by DRM. And then, no matter how strong or weak that DRM was, it was circumvented.\n\nI have an ereader, canvas rendered, that is protected by DRM, that protects one sole work. The eReader is on the website that hosts it. The work is also available via Google Books, Apple Books and AWS, all protected by their own DRM.\n\nWhich means once it is copied and the DRM cracked, doesn't matter whose DRM was cracked, and it has been because I have found copies in the wild, I, as a proprietor of DRM, can bring suit against anybody using my work in their dataset.\n\nThis is not a civil copyright issue at this point. It is criminal law and DMCA 1201 anti-circumvention. And anti-circumvention, as written in the DMCA, does not end at the party who broke the DRM, but at the terminal beneficiary, i.e. those using the work that was originally protected by the DRM.\n\nRealNetworks v. DVD CCA, and Napster and Grokster contributory copyright cases are the precedent here. Also see Cartoon Network v. CSC Holdings/Cablevision.\n\nThis is still a legal grey area, but one I am willing to test.\n\nAnd because I developed a userland DRM written in Typescript, transpiled to JavaScript, I'm basically sat on a legal timebomb for a variety of modern companies who love to claim they are not infringing copyright.\n\nI have a legal chain of custody where the work, when shown in public, was never not protected by DRM.\n\nAdvisement to author: Seek legal counsel, you might need it soon.\n\nDownvoting is fine, it means you do not understand the legal arguments.\n\nI do not personally like the DMCA and think it is a terrible law and should never have been written, and certainly not as it is, but that does not change the fact that the law is established. It either applies equally, to everyone, or it applies to no one. And right now, certain large scale entities are enjoying the fruits of others' labours.",

All he basically does is capturing the audio output of the browser. This is no different than connecting a tape recorder to your speaker output and pressing record. Popular browsers are open source, so anyone could easily add a bit of code into the browser itself that dumps audio samples to disk, which would then be completely site agnostic. This is why browsers use 3rd party DRM components. He is not in any way preventing the DRM system from functioning as intended because he only deals with what happens at the output end. Youtube downloaders are in a similar situation, and they're currently winning. Youtube-dl and its derivatives are still freely available in source and binary form. Multiple corporations tried to have those repositories shut down, but they always lost, and the repositories were reinstated shortly after.\n\nAt worst, he might be violating copyright law by providing means to record the samples but that may also not hold due to many jurisdictions contain provisions that give you the right to make private copies or backup copies of material you consume.",
