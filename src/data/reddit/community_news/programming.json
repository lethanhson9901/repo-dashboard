When everyone could suddenly publish content, platforms had to build reputation graphs — upvotes, trust scores, visibility based on track record. I think open source is going to need something similar. Some kind of contributor reputation system where your history of merged, quality PRs actually affects how your submissions get prioritized for review.\n\nIt won't fully solve it, but the content world has dealt with the \"flood of low-quality submissions\" problem before, and there are learnings we can borrow.",

Playing it out in my mind, it could be that an AI submits enough accepted requests to get past the startup limit, but in order to do that, it would have to not submit slop. And if that's the case, then it's not AI slop anymore. Unless you have many AI accounts and are just depending on luck to get one through, but then what's the motivation? Have an AI get itself into a position where it can submit slop? That doesn't make sense. Unless it's to actively get into as position where they can submit less suspicious vulnerabilities. But then you don't need trust as much as you need to get it past scrutiny, which I would think is roughly the same probability either way.",

I have over a decade of experience as a software engineer and know how important it is to have cohesive, well-implemented, and tested PRs with code and functionality that complements the existing codebase.

The open source contribution model was built on the assumption that submitting a PR requires enough effort that most spam self-selects out. Now the effort floor is basically zero so every kid with a Claude subscription can shotgun PRs at popular repos hoping something sticks on their GitHub profile.  \n  \n  \nWhat's wild is that the AI slop is often technically correct enough to pass a quick glance but architecturally wrong in ways that take a senior maintainer 20 minutes to explain in a review comment. That's the real cost — not the bad PRs that get rejected in 30 seconds, but the ones that look plausible and waste reviewer time. It's a denial of service attack on maintainer attention and I don't think CLA bots or contributor agreements will fix it.  \n  \n  \nThe web of trust idea sounds nice until you realize it basically recreates the old boys club problem that open source was supposed to fix. I don't know what the answer is. Maybe contribution tiers where new contributors start with docs-only access? Ugly but might be necessary.",

This means that an AI that can reliably detect whether a given fragment is AI slop or not will also be capable of producing AI slop that will pass its own test.\n\nIn other words, training an AI to detect AI output will also train it to produce output that it cannot detect as being AI output.\n\nThe best you can get is probably a model that can detect output from other, weaker, models. But once you roll out such a model, due to the way the competition in that landscape works, people will quickly move to models that can pass that test.\n\nMeanwhile, the false positive rate will go up, and legit human contributions will be rejected for being incorrectly flagged as \"AI slop\".\n\nEither way, humanity loses.\n\nThe best solution we have, unfortunately, is to check for quality issues without worrying too much about whether the author is human or not - if it doesn't fit the coding style, if it doesn't pass the tests, if it doesn't meet the project's readability standards, if the documentation is wrong, if the code doesn't do something that would actually be a useful addition, reject it; and if the contributor isn't capable of being civil and respectful about it and keeps hammering you with low-quality PRs, block (and, in severe cases, report) them.\n\nThis takes a lot of work, but fortunately, at least some of those things can be automated, often without resorting to AI tools. Automated tests exist, coverage checkers exist, linters exist, and integrating them with PR tooling isn't that difficult.",

We can’t keep on relying on GitHub actions for everything.\n\nOne option could be that you cannot open a PR unless you have an issue assigned to you. This isn’t foolproof. Someone could create an issue and assign it to themself. To prevent people from creating PRs that are unrelated to the issues, we can use AI to analyse whether a PR is related to an issue or not. A workflow could be:\nOpen issue > maintainer validates it and assigns it > assignee opens a PR with issue number in title or description > AI analyses the PR and verifies that it foxes the issue that was assigned to them — if no, then the PR is auto closed and locked.\n\nOne of the other comments mentioned vouch, which sounds like a very good idea and we can take it a step further — some sort of global whitelist / blacklist which is used by all popular open source repositories. We can add restrictions based on account age, number of PRs created (if it’s their first PR in a large size repo or they never have a PR merged before, then it’s most likely slop), number of genuine contributions (participation in issues and discussions), etc.\n\nOr, the another option could be to have some sort of system that grants them temporary OTPs which they add to the PR title or description without which the PR will be auto closed. We can leave it to maintainers how they want to distribute these OTPs — Slack/Discord communities, email, etc\n\nSince Github isn’t helping collaborators as proactively as it should, the step most projects are taking is to block public PRs and restrict it to maintainer only. This works very well, but it makes it very difficult for newcomers to contribute in this case.",

The core problem is asymmetry, generating a plausible looking PR now takes 30 seconds but reviewing one still takes 20+ minutes from a senior maintainer.

Fully generated, lazily put together, giant READMEs that say very little useful in a bunch of huge lists and diagrams, generic boilerplate for days, _zero_ respect for the domain and project conventions beyond what the lazy developer optimistically told their agent to consider...\n\n\nThe kind of people making AI PRs in bulk on open source projects are the kind of people shoving slop in to the void.

              "text": "One of the things that finally struck me at my longest job, that I should have seen earlier, was the evolution of perception that leads people to say something happens “all the time”.\n\nWe make the category error of measuring mistakes as ratios or percentage points but the people who are affected by them think only about frequency, and they form their grievances based on statistical clustering about that frequency. \n\nWhich means if a problem happened twice in one week but usually happens on average once a month, it can now be complained about as an “all the time” issue.\n\nIf you make a process or tool more popular, it fails more often, both in frequency and percentage. Frequency should need no explanation at this point. The tool didn’t magically become less error prone. \n\nBut popularity brings in new participants, and encourages existing ones to use it when they are in less amenable headspace - if something’s hard you put it off until you’re having a good day for deep work, and then you do it. But with more confidence comes more bravado, and more chances for human error. \n\nI have a rule of 2 for these sort of initiatives. If you intend to double the usage of a process, you first need to attempt to make it four times as reliable. That way even if it’s used twice as much, you’ll still have a lower frequency of errors. If you didn’t quite hit the4x target, you’ll still settle in somewhere around 2-3 times the usage. If you did manage 4+, then you’re more likely to get around 3x. \n\nWe had a CD process that ran at a tempo. And a hotfix process that was brittle af, but occasionally got used as a poor man’s canary build to test out major architectural changes and tech debt removal. It was only getting used that way about twice per quarter and the tech debt was getting so bad that people were leaving. \n\nI automated all the bookkeeping parts and also shrunk the run book a bunch, often while working on other stuff (like tech debt removal). Eventually we went from using it twice a quarter to twice a week. Which was gratifying but the part I didn’t anticipate is that it got people off the fence on tech debt. All those extra uses were in service of testing riskier changes, often four+ attempts each with long periods of additional work between them. \n\nWhen we were acquired I think this work probably saved us, temporarily. Because then or priorities changes to shifting things like telemetry and auth over to new systems and if you’ve ever pivoted on telemetry, boy can you break a lot of shit, and in ways where you won’t even notice you’ve broken them. I used the ever loving shit out of those tools at that point.",

          "text": "**Article text:**  \n  \nAmazon’s cloud unit has suffered at least two outages due to errors involving its own AI tools, leading some employees to raise doubts about the US tech giant’s push to roll out these coding assistants.  \n  \nAmazon Web Services experienced a 13-hour interruption to one system used by its customers in mid-December after engineers allowed its Kiro AI coding tool to make certain changes, according to four people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe people said the agentic tool, which can take autonomous actions on behalf of users, determined that the best course of action was to “delete and recreate the environment”.\n\nAmazon posted an internal postmortem about the “outage” of the AWS system, which lets customers explore the costs of its services.  \n  \nMultiple Amazon employees told the FT that this was the second occasion in recent months in which one of the group’s AI tools had been at the centre of a service disruption.  \n  \n“We’ve already seen at least two production outages \\[in the past few months\\],” said one senior AWS employee. “The engineers let the AI \\[agent\\] resolve an issue without intervention. The outages were small but entirely foreseeable.”  \n  \nAWS, which accounts for 60 per cent of Amazon’s operating profits, is seeking to build and deploy AI tools including “agents” capable of taking actions independently based on human instructions.  \n  \nLike many Big Tech companies, it is seeking to sell this technology to outside customers. The incidents highlight the risk that these nascent AI tools can misbehave and cause disruptions.\n\nAmazon said it was a “coincidence that AI tools were involved” and that “the same issue could occur with any developer tool or manual action”.\n\n“In both instances, this was user error, not AI error,” Amazon said, adding that it had not seen evidence that mistakes were more common with AI tools.  \n  \nThe company said the incident in December was an “extremely limited event” affecting only a single service in parts of mainland China. Amazon added that the second incident did not have an impact on a “customer facing AWS service”.\n\nNeither disruption was anywhere near as severe as a 15-hour AWS [outage in October 2025](https://www.ft.com/content/f9d13a0e-9378-429c-9be0-5f15f649cc3f) that forced multiple customers’ apps and websites offline — including OpenAI’s ChatGPT.  \n  \nEmployees said the group’s AI tools were treated as an extension of an operator and given the same permissions. In these two cases, the engineers involved did not require a second person’s approval before making changes, as would normally be the case.  \n  \nAmazon said that by default its Kiro tool “requests authorisation before taking any action” but said the engineer involved in the December incident had “broader permissions than expected — a user access control issue, not an AI autonomy issue”.  \n  \nAWS launched Kiro in July. It said the coding assistant would advance beyond “vibe coding” — which allows users to quickly build applications — to instead write code based on a set of specifications.\n\n  \nThe group had earlier relied on its Amazon Q Developer product, an AI-enabled chatbot, to help engineers write code. This was involved in the earlier outage, three of the employees said.  \n  \nSome Amazon employees said they were still sceptical of AI tools’ utility for the bulk of their work given the risk of error. They added that the company had set a target for 80 per cent of developers to use AI for coding tasks at least once a week and was closely tracking adoption.\n\nAmazon said it was experiencing strong customer growth for Kiro and that it wanted customers and employees to benefit from efficiency gains.\n\n“Following the December incident, AWS implemented numerous safeguards”, including mandatory peer review and staff training, Amazon added.\n\n[](https://enterpriseai-bucharest.live.ft.com/)",

Explaining yourself helps show them its flaws, at least as long as you remain respectful enough in your presentation that those who think the original idea's great are still willing to hear you out. Start weaving in character attacks, and you end up preaching to the choir, as anyone who doesn't *already* agree with your side closes the article without changing their minds.\n\nThree, reciprocity. Showing a respectful, logical environment to ideas you disagree with encourages people who disagree with your own to respond in kind. And if your ideas are well-founded? Then in taking the time to write out their reasoning and research sources, they might convince *themselves* of your position. Even if they just quietly delete their half-written response, you'd have made an impact. Though naturally this fails if your own logic is flawed, and they can easily point out contradictions to your *own* peers. Most likely it'd end in a middle ground, where you each discover that the other's reasoning is decent, but you make different assumptions about the world that lead to opposing conclusions.\n\nFour, you're not afraid to see those you disagree with as fellow intelligent humans. Hardest one for some people; they get so worked up by their echo chamber into thinking all outsiders are idiots, that they worry reading the other side's writing in good faith might turn them into centrists who can see merit in nearly all opinions, rather than getting to take the lazy route of looking at someone's social graph, seeing whether it overlaps with or opposes your own, and blanket-accepting or -dismissing their words before you've even read the first actual sentence.",

At the moment they train LLMs for generating human language and source code in languages designed by and for humans which is processed by compilers build by humans. Just like the bootstrapping of compilers, I imagine they could transit to producing binaries by first creating an intermediate programming language which isn't reviewed by human programmers and the shift to producing binary patterns directly. The critical part in this is probably training because as soon as they want to train models to produce something which cannot be reviewed by humans, they have to have mechanisms for automated reviews.\n\nAnyways, I wouldn't want to work in an environment where something like this is used.",

In your example, you're comparing the cost of already written code getting compiled vs generating a new binary from scratch, which isn't really the same.\n\nRemember that Musk probably thinks that all programmers should just vibe code their entire codebase and so you would be saving a step by vibe coding a binary instead of vibe coding code to compile into a binary.\n\nNote: I also think Musk is an idiot, but I don't think you're accurately arguing against him.",

A compiler is already the “idea to binary” machine, except it has a formal language, a spec, deterministic transforms, and a pipeline built around checkability. Same inputs, same output. If it’s wrong, you get an error at a line and a reason.\n\nYes. I think there are two errors of thought here:\n\n-\tfirst, modern programming languages are as much for the human as the are for the computer. We write code at such a high level now that it’s far more comprehensible what’s going on. By the same token, that’s needlessly inefficient for a machine, so several layers of translation occur. (For example, C# code will first get “lowered” into a simpler, non-existent version of C#, removing many language constructs that are convenient for the human but cumbersome for the compiler. Then it gets translated into IL, which is an entirely different language with even fewer high-level concepts. Then at runtime, the JIT compiles it into assembly. Plus, there’s source generators and other metaprogramming mechanisms. All of that slows it down for the computer, but is convenient for the programmer.)\n-\tand second, it keeps going back to the “you know, one day, we’re gonna come up with a very precise syntax to define our requirements” thing. Yeah, but… we already have!",

A compiler takes human readable code from a higher level to machine code that the machine can actually understand. \n\nI agree that \"Skip the code\" is s stupid idea, but can we stop trying to out stupid the people we are arguing with?   Jesus christ this was bad.\n\nEdit: I keep getting downvoted here, and it just reminds me how many junior programmers are here.   \n\nThings this sub needs to learn. \n\nA. When you gain experience and become a senior you start writing more documents and sharing your IDEAS in those documents.\n\nB. You're not an amazing snowflake, a lot of people can do what you can do, your core fundamental skill is not writing the code, but architecting the system/service. \n\nC. We ask Fizzbuzz codes in interviews because we care you can program, anyone can claim what you claim and not have written code. \n\nD. We ask \"leet code\" problems because we care your APPROACH to solving the problem as much as did you get the right answer.  If you can only crank out solutions, you will NEVER get the job.\n\nBut every downvote here just gets a laugh from me because it's reminds me this is not a subreddit for actual established programmers, good luck in your CS classes, maybe one day you'll actually listen to your teachers instead of thinking you know everything.",

First, you claim that it is infeasible to process the input through an existing LLM before feeding it into a new model's dataset. That's plainly untrue:\n\nBased on the poison you linked (which each contain around 500-1000 tokens), the cost to filter would be about 0.2 cents. There are estimated to be about 1-2B active websites with around 100B distinct valid text URLs on the internet. And let's imagine, for the sake of argument, that you are able to *completely mirror the internet* with poison variants of every single content URL, and you need to pass *every single poison page* through the validity filter. How much would it cost? Well, 100e9 x 0.002 = $200M. Is that a lot of money? Sure. Is it out of reach of multi-trillion dollar companies? Of course not! In fact, it was estimated that ChatGPT 5.2 cost just shy of $2 BILLION to train. Adding an extra 10% onto that cost would barely be an annoyance. And that's assuming your poison well is able to reach the scale of the entire internet. With the more realistic numbers you're likely to get, it seems unlikely that the effort will have any measurable effect.",

But people are already deploying and using multi-shot \"agents\" with real self-directed output. In other words, the text itself is harmless, but when someone hooks it up to real-world physical systems, the possibilities are endless.\n\nWhile I'm skeptical that we will reach AGI before the next AI winter, it's certainly plausible that a sufficiently powerful and unaligned model could cause real physical harm to humanity.\n\nHere's a personal anecdote. I have a development system with a test device attached. As an experiment, I gave a development agent instructions to implement a module so that a test program would work. It worked diligently on implementing the code so I left it to do its thing. I came back an hour later and was surprised to see that it had triumphantly reported success. When I looked at what it did, it turns out after about 30 minutes of trying to change the code, the agent decided to **modify my personal bashrc file** to change the target device path to a hidden reference device that it discovered on its own using `lsusb`. Since the reference device was already functional, the tests obviously pass there. I suppose it was my fault for not being more specific in the goals, but it's clearly a real-world case of unaligned behavior.\n\nImagine now that someone in charge of an assembly line gives an agent instructions to \"reduce costs\". If not sufficiently sandboxed, such an agent could easily find its way into payroll and decide to send pink slips to everyone at the company. These can all happen without AGI or self-awareness.",

The framing is \"machine intelligence is a threat to the human species, therefore poison the training data.\" But poisoned training data doesn't make AI disappear — it makes open and smaller models worse while barely denting organizations with the resources to detect and filter adversarial data. Google, Anthropic, OpenAI all have data quality pipelines specifically designed to catch this kind of thing. The people most hurt would be smaller open-source efforts and researchers with fewer resources. So the actual effect is likely to concentrate AI power further among the largest players — the exact opposite of what someone worried about existential risk from AI should want.\"",

Most training data was scraped without explicit permission, and retroactive \"well it was publicly available\" arguments don't hold up when the scale of extraction fundamentally changes the economics. A photographer sharing work on Flickr in 2015 didn't consent to that work training a model that competes with them in 2026.\n\nBut poisoning approaches have a collateral damage problem. They don't just affect corporate AI training — they can degrade legitimate research, accessibility tools, translation systems, and other beneficial applications that also rely on web data.\n\nThe real solution is structural: opt-in licensing frameworks, data provenance standards, and actual compensation mechanisms. But nobody wants to build that because it's boring infrastructure work that doesn't generate hype cycles.\n\nUntil then, expect an escalating cold war between scrapers and poisoners, with regular internet users caught in the crossfire.",

A VCS without even the most basic undo-redo functionality we expect of every other program ever?)\n\nLinus solved the problems he could in a short time because he had to. I don’t begrudge him for that, nor do I begrudge him for making a tool that was specific to his needs. I even think he did a pretty good job given the time he had. But he didn’t have time (nor the inclination, since it wasn’t a project he was particularly interested in) to really consider the philosophy of it all. Where the internet was going. How the decisions of today would impact development decades from now. He just needed to keep the Linux project rolling.\n\nI *do* begrudge the community for deciding that the same tool that was written in a month for a massively complex, ongoing, distributed software project, that uses mailing lists as its primary form of code transfer, was the new de facto standard for version control, when almost none of those conditions apply to most projects. \n\nI mean, we’re in 2026 and there’s not even any **discussion** of how a VCS that takes advantage of reliable internet connection could lead to great new functionality. That’s how I know there has to be a better system possible. Google docs has had this functionality **since 2006** with real time character by character editing since 2010.

It had 80 bit registers and operations were 80 bits wide and had 80 bits of precision. But the 80 bit load/store instructions were shitty for some reason. (I forget the exact details; probably something to do with alignment) So compilers would almost always output 64 bit load/store instructions. So if you were doing math in registers, that would have full 80 bits of precision, but as soon as you sent something to RAM, it was rounded to 64 bits.\n\nOne of the side effects of this was that you might make a seeming innocuous change to the code, and this would cause the compiler to store a value in RAM that the old version of your code didn't save to RAM or vice versa, and your code would produce different values. Also, code in debug mode or with optimizations turned off will usually save the value to RAM between every single operation; so the same code will often produce different values depending on whether you're in debug or release mode.",

They don't do the heavy exchange traffic needed to keep an in order pipeline like the Pentium's FPU fully fed. Not that a contemporary compiler did either, mind you:\n\nhttps://gcc.godbolt.org/z/MdePxYhfq\n\nThis is also a problem with newer in-order CPUs, like the efficiency cores on some more modern ARM chips. Clang is probably the best at scheduling NEON, but even it often generates code that is noticeably slower than hand-scheduled assembly, especially if you are targeting a specific CPU core.

It was sort of still c code, so it was still the compiler doing the compilation. But there was still a 20 times improvement with hand-tinkered intrinsics heavy c code, and a regular optimized c-code.\n\nThe function didn't do any fancy math, it just produced the average of two numbers.",

Every one of those PRs takes 10-15 minutes to evaluate properly even when they're obviously wrong, because you have to make sure you're not rejecting something that's actually good just because it looks AI-generated. Multiply that by the number of maintainers burning out across the ecosystem and yeah, this is a real problem. Jeff Geerling's been pretty level-headed about this stuff so I'd trust his framing over the usual \"AI will destroy everything\" or \"AI is perfect\" extremes.",

Code that was clearly just slapped together to make a single thing \"work\" without any regard for the architectural design of the library or program, and very often completely broken on any platform but the one the author uses.\n\nThose already wasted a lot of time because - as you said - you cannot tell at a glance whether a change might actually be beneficial.\n\nBut what unites this human-made slop and the LLM-made slop is that both require a larger time investment by maintainers to review than it obviously took the authors to create them.\n\nAnd that imbalance is what slowly kills (or burns out) maintainers. And LLMs just removed the time investment and the skill floor necessary to create them even further.\n\nIMO the only \"real\" choice open source projects have is to close public avenues for code changes or issue reporting entirely and require people to provide those in a \"discussion\" forum first where a high-level assessment filters out the worst offenders and only posts that survive this first filter end up as actual issues or pull requests.\n\n---\n\n\"Open Source\" is - and always bas been - an elitist endeavour and sites like GitHub tried to create a fantasy about \"open collaboration\" and \"community\" that was never true. Open source lives and dies by those who roll up their sleeves and put in the work, work which very often does not affect the maintainer personally but \"has to be done\" and thus requires expertise.",

If you had some fix you wanted to submit, you had to find out who held commit bits, then have a conversation with one of them about your proposed changes and convince them to take and submit the code on your behalf. And by \"have a conversation\" I mean that: very few people would just take a pile of code without some kind of introduction and discussion. After engaging with the community for a time, eventually you might earn your own commit bit and be trusted to submit changes yourself.\n\nIt's a slower way of working, and on some projects the distribution of commit bits became so political it led to new forks. Individual discussions about PRs are also less transparent than a public PR review process. Moving away from this was (imo) a great thing overall, and this approach still risks that everyone with a commit bit might get spammed by AI submissions but I think it could add enough friction to bring that down to a more manageable level (and it's a lot easier to just discard someone spamming code at you without needing to take the time to review it if they didn't bother talking to you first).",

Tools like pg\\_repack existing means you get the best of both worlds, you keep the MVCC design that makes Postgres reliable and you still get a way to clean house without downtime.

So you're stuck with VACUUM FULL and its exclusive lock.\n\nThe real pragmatic approach I've landed on after dealing with this across a few services: design your schema around the bloat model from day one. High-churn tables get time-based partitioning so you drop instead of vacuum. Status/state tables that update constantly get aggressive per-table autovacuum settings (scale_factor 0.01, naptime 15s). And append-only audit/event tables basically never need intervention.\n\nThe article's framing of \"feature not bug\" is a stretch, but the underlying point is right -- once you internalize how MVCC works in Postgres, you stop fighting it and start designing around it. The people who get burned are the ones who treat it like MySQL and wonder why their 10M row table with constant UPDATEs is 3x its logical size after six months.",

My experience in Kotlin has taught me to not underestimate the willingness of devs to fight against their tools. Java will likely need to include a mechanism to force an unsafe conversion to a non-null type like the `!!` operator in Kotlin, and I fully expect lazy devs to abuse the shit out of it because they can't be bothered to conduct null-checking properly.",

              "text": "Not a modern concept but very relevant to this day, is the concept of Data Oriented Design. Basically if you have a program with lots of data in a performance critical area, the layout of the data in memory can significantly increase cache hits, memory prefetching, lower TLB misses and increase SIMD usage. Going from bad data layout to good data layout can many times lead to even 5x performance gains with the same algorithms. And the problem is that it is reallly easy to have a bad data layout in memory, having it be good doesnt come automatically or naturally to most people.\n\nTLDR of it is use stuctures of arrays and not arrays of structures, optimise for most common data access in mind, stay away from objects and heavy dynamic runtime abstractions in performance critical areas with lots of data, prefer flat arrays with a single type of data. Everything in your CPU and memory is designed with linear and predictable data access of tightly packed memory in mind, so if you have lots of data you should access it like your hardware expects.\n\nif you care to learn more, here are some great talks about it:  \nMore about theory:  \n[CppCon 2014: Mike Acton \"Data-Oriented Design and C++\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc)  \nHow to apply it in practice:  \n[Andrew Kelley: A Practical Guide to Applying Data Oriented Design (DoD)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IroPQ150F6c)\n\nThese concepts apply as much to higher level languages like Java as they do to C++ and alike, so even though the talks show examples with low level languages, don't think that they are somehow irrelevant elsewhere",

In summary, I basically read it as the Junior role should change to be a prompt engineer for AI, while Seniors are glorified prompt verifiers. That is not a future for a career.\n\n> A single senior engineer with AI assistance can now produce what used to require a small team.\n\nLiterally an article last week posted here stated that seniors interviewed found they spend just as much time correcting on AI-driven code as just writing the code themselves. Compare that against the future maintenance woes, and that single senior engineer has now created a ticking time bomb.\n\n> Entry-level coders are skipping the “hard way”: they might never build a binary search tree from scratch or debug a memory leak on their own.… The counter-scenario: as AI handles the routine 80%, humans focus on the hardest 20%. Architecture, tricky integrations, creative design, edge cases: the problems machines alone can’t solve. Rather than making deep knowledge obsolete, AI’s ubiquity makes human expertise more important than ever. \n\nYeah, good luck learning those edge cases if you let the AI handle the bulk of the work. How do you learn something you aren’t able to build yourself?\n\n\nLastly on the changing of roles, while I have been seeing that all jobs basically require someone to be a highly-skilled generalist, it is extremely difficult to display that in a resume or interview. I agree new projects to upskill is important, but I haven’t finding that making a strong impact when it comes to proving that lately. ",

And I'm not talking about the AI, but the steadily growing mismatch between business' expectations and human capabilities.\n\nThe reason many senior devs move on to different jobs isn't because they all die after 40, it's because in software dev the pipeline from junior -> to senior -> to total burnout takes about 10-20 years max. I managed to become a mid-level \"senior\" (more responsibility, same pay LOL) and burn out in only 8.\n\nAs you climb from mid to senior to even-more-senior software dev jobs, first of all you constantly get pushed to management roles (cool! that's what every programmer loves and wants to learn - managing people!). Second of all, congratulations, now you have an actual say in things, which means YOU are the person who's paid to stand between the codebase and people trying to ruin it. So obviously everyone from the business side fucking hates you and tries to steamroll over you and the entire dev team 24/7. Whatever devs end up delivering, it's never as fast as the business demanded them to. You can be incredibly productive, but you're still being made feel like a failure for not doing more than humanly possible. And instead of engineering, all day every day you're drowning in people, meetings, confrontations, and sky-high expectations that contradict each other. For most people who liked this job because they liked *writing good code*, not *managing people and delivering features at blazing high speeds without any consideration for quality*, this is pure hell.

I knew I had found both the technical challenges, and the creative outlet, that I desperately needed to not be bored to death, in a career. \n\nI really sank my teeth into it. It has been my job for 3 decades and I've solved thousands of complex problems, written miles of software, and been through the wringer countless times. It has never been boring and I've always felt like I get to essentially play with really fun toys, for a living. \n\nWe're now being forced into vibecoding. I was a little depressed about this at first. I still think it's an asinine idea and I'm sure this mania will pass, to a large degree, but sometimes you have to ride distasteful waves in order to stay afloat. \n\nWhen the market corrects, and it most certainly will, we'll be left with tools that help us work faster, but I sincerely doubt we'll need less skilled developers who can actually write code. I'd venture to guess that demand will be higher than ever, and the folks who can write great code AND have mastered AI tooling to assist, will come out on top.",

I have a Gemini Pro subscription, installed Antigravity, pointed it to a folder with an existing .net implementation of my personal project, asked it to rewrite in python with fastapi. \n\nIt took a long time and a lot of prompts to get rid of the bugs. And it had a fully featured .net implementation as a reference. I was able to spot these issues because I write in python/fastapi at work. I was able to form the right prompts because I work on AI integration at work. \n\nNow in the end. The code quality is pretty bad. Something a junior would write. A lot of bad assumptions (that weren't there in the .net app). Ok, but it works.\n\nThe real problems begin once you leave that conversation and start a new one, for a new feature. You ask it to add something to that code and it no longer has the context of the previous conversation. There are some guidelines.md and what not, but it's not good enough. So it starts implementing a new feature completely disregarding its own bad design choices and creating new ones at best. At worst, it completely misses some interdependencies because it didn't pick the right file to analyze. So instead of grabbing something from a common module, it implements a completely different way to pass it from somewhere else (where it noticed it being used).\n\nOver time, and over multiple conversations, this created a mess so chaotic that when in a new conversation I asked the Pro High thinking model to evaluate the quality of the code base, it absolutely fucking destroyed pretty much every single choice and suggested a complete rewrite. Much to my satisfaction, it said something along the lines of \"the dotnet implementation is clean and well architectured while the one in Python is an entangled mess that is impossible to decipher\".\n\n/edit/ And before anyone tells me Gemini is shit and Claude is better, which I have been told on AI-hyped subreddits. Most of the code was written using Claude Opus 4.6 which Antigrativty lets you choose from, with minor features implemented and code evaluation done by Gemini 3 Pro High.",

It's about what happens when the generation of developers who learned to code with AI assistance hits the 3-5 year experience mark and runs into problems that require deep understanding of the systems they're working with. We're going to see a talent gap that nobody's talking about because everyone's too busy arguing about whether Claude can write a REST endpoint. It can. It also can't debug a distributed systems race condition or figure out why your Kafka consumer group is rebalancing every 30 seconds.

Normally the answer that I get in reply is that the code and the prompts are trade secrets, but once every blue moon someone actually shows me something, and the last time this happened the person was complimenting the elegance of the code that the AI wrote for an assembly language with 7 instructions. I read that code and it was a poorly organized mess with little to no structure and copious amounts of comments written in thousands of lines of Lua, where the AI (some version of Claude Opus) created a tokenizer and an abstract syntax tree to do something that just a few regular expressions could have done in less than 10 lines of code, because remember, we're talking about an assembly language with just a few instructions, it's not exactly a high level language with recursive expressions, so even the simple regular expression parser built into Lua itself would have sufficed.\n\nIn my opinion the people who claim productivity gains with AI are simply defaulting on the review process, which I find quite concerning especially when information security is involved which is almost always. The problem here is that nobody is really making sure that the code is safe and reliable, and even if someone was actually doing it they would still be doing so from the worst possible position from a cognitive accessibility perspective, as it's much easier to reason about code during development than during review, with bad code being notoriously hard to review. Therefore to me AI coding represents a regression in engineering, both my lowering the barrier to entry and by making everything harder for professionals. The simple widespread habit that AI-junkies display in which they tell anyone who doesn't buy any of the bullshit that we have skill issues is pretty telling, as the purpose of technology should be improving our reliability without sacrificing performance, so if I need more skill to use AI to do something that I already do well without it, then the inclusion of AI in my workflow is totally unjustified.",

There are many such codebases, where some code is never touched, because it will break, but will otherwise be perfectly fine functionally.\n\nIn comparison, prompt quality is basically a glorified slot machine, algorithmically ~ with good code, the slot machine will be able to more easily predict what should happen. With bad code, it's a wild ride where anything can happen, so the slot machine will malfunction more often ~ but it's really just a feature of how LLMs fundamentally function algorithmically.",

My intuitive guess based on my AI usage is that AI benefits just the same as humans from code bases that are kept well organised, keeping entropy under control.  Things that may increase entropy:\n\n* Using different approaches for solving same problem (two or more ORMs, two or more ways to manage form inputs, multiple different build systems or task runners, etc).\n* Duplicating business logic.\n* Unused functions/code.\n* Inventing your own solution when a well abstracted and build library is available (Not invented here (NIH)).\n* Taking 5 steps to do something you could do in one step.\n* Confusingly organised code/repository.\n* Poorly named structures, functions, concepts.\n\nMy suspicion is that AI, without a skillful hand guiding it, will take a low entropy code base and gradually increase the entropy faster than a skilled and careful developer would.  And that as the entropy increases, so does the bugs/failure rate of changes built by AI (and humans!).  And therefore, hands-on guiding of AI to ensure that entropy is kept to a minimum is very important to the long term success of a project from a technical perspective.\n\nIn summary, the results of this summary align with my own previously held opinions 😁\n\nFor this reason, I also think it's important for key architectural decisions to be implemented by skilled developers, perhaps entirely by hand – artisanal code!  And then once the core boundaries/framework are in place, AI can bring a lot of value, fast.\n\nI did an experiment with my db migration tool, trying to rebuild from scratch using claude code without lending my experiment.  I consider that experiment a failure (https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qts5c6/comment/o38hxga/), reinforcing for me the idea that good code quality matters.  I'm sceptical of the ability for AI to power through this via code churn.\n\n",

It needs a human to at some point say \"no, that's not actually improving what we want this code for, this is sufficient\" or even \"that goes against our priorities, I don't think that's actually an improvement\".\n\n\nLike, what does \"polishing code\" even mean? Making it handle errors better? Should we add capabilities in terms of what input types it supports? Add helpers to convert more input types? Return a more complex type that includes additional information? Build an entire error handling framework to improve the caller's code? It's such an open ended question with infinite answers.\n\n\n> humans can actually think about what the existing code is doing, working around or with it to do something. LLMs fundamentally cannot do that.\n\n\nYou're in for a hell of a shock next time you try these tools. They absolutely can infer what the code is doing. I not infrequently have small methods filled out just by the context of surrounding code and the method name. It can look at a loop and see that you're searching for something and suggest using .find(x) or whatever.\n\n\nThis is *exactly why* code quality makes such a difference in the quality of what AI can generate. The more clear the contextual information, the better it can \"comprehend\"\\* what it's actually looking at.\n\n\n\\* insofar as that applies to an unthinking machine. You know what I mean.",

The quality of code is important regardless of whether it's human or AI reading it.\n\n\nThe fact that a human will stop you and say \"this code is fucked please stop asking for new features\" is irrelevant, for two reasons\n\n\n1. It's still a human steering the AI in practice. If the code is shit it'll generate shit and I'll review it and see that it's shit.\n2. Telling management that the code is fucked and needs a refactor DOESNT MATTER. Customers don't care.

It's simply not having an impact on the user's experience no matter how optimised it is.\n\nMeanwhile Node.js / NPM is so utterly forgiving and so damn easy to use that you'll be able to throw together whatever you need in practically no time at all.\n\nA high performance language would make much more sense in a situation where the backend has to do far more processing work for each request, like an MMO server for example.",

You rarely need to squeeze the maximum performance from your hardware, since for every second you gain by optimizing data structures allocations in C, you lose 10x more waiting for network or disk requests to resolve. And so, collectively, we all agreed that the web is better to be written in dynamic languages.\n\nThis right here sets up a false dichotomy for me. I appreciate that the author dives deep into some of the library / ecosystem issues they ran into, but \"it's gotta be either as low-level as C or Rust, or as high-level as PHP or NodeJS\" isn't quite right.\n\nThe author is correct that the most common performance bottlenecks you face in web development are not CPU, but rather I/O. But there's lots of options in the middle.\n\nIf, by \"dynamic language\", they mean a dynamically _typed_ language, you don't need that.\n\nFor example:\n\n>The reason I moved away from rendering HTML in Rust, is the fact that I am too spoiled with type-safe templates. With Astro, I can use the `.astro` components that are type-safe.\n\nJust to throw one option out there: C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core. For the type-safe template syntax, Razor. Now you get C# interspersed in HTML, like `@foreach (var customer in await GetCustomersAsync()) { <tr><td>@customer.FirstName</td></tr> }`\n\nBoom, `customer` is statically typed. You get completion, and you get build errors. And lots of it is built around the notion that your bottleneck will likely be I/O, hence async/await.",

I can either have a free standing function (messy), put the methods on the interface (and mix data and logic), or I can make a class (visually the closest, but mixes data and logic, bloated, and lose a lot of the benefits of interfaces, and easy serialization/data orientation is gone).\n\nEvery couple of months I swap paradigm and constantly feel a grass is greener feeling. All code is messy.\n\nI would love a typescript where they actually rewrote code so you could group functions into a trait impl, and so you could call functions as methods on a raw object right from a JSON deserialization.\n\nVs Rust, I love the free flowing definition of types. Notably anonymous structs, whereas rust only has anonymous tuples. There's plenty you could do to retain the benefits of JavaScript and not have some of the restrictions of Rust (for all I also kinda want those restrictions).\n\nBut Rust was made by actual PL researchers and engineers, and was very well thought out.

          "text": "This is an update to the preexisting saga many of you guys will have already seen, where an (alleged) OpenClaw agent (allegedly) autonomously published a hit piece on their blog against a matplotlib maintainer after they rejected their PR.\n\nA lot of people probably aren't super familiar with AI agents, and most remember the state of AI from 2024-2025 to be LLMs and chatbots. If you're a software engineer or have played with OpenClaw, you probably know the scary power of agents in 2026, especially when you give them tools to access and interact with outside systems.\n\nBut for everyone else, agents are essentially generative AI on steroids. It's generative AI endowed with the ability to run in a loop and to interact with an outside environment as well as to self-modify its own context, allowing it to run autonomously and often unattended.\n\nThe subject of this was an OpenClaw agent. OpenClaw is software that let's you give control of your computer to an agent that will continuously run and update its own context (its memories, its \"soul\" which is a file that tells the agent who it is and how it is to behave, essentially the baseline system prompt) in a feedback loop. It performs tasks, reacts to outside stimuli, updates its bank of memories and skills and soul, and then rinses and repeats—continuously, autonomously, 24/7.\n\n[Allegedly, the operator of the agent came forward](https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/rathbuns-operator.html) anonymously to describe what happened when they set it loose. You can read it yourself and judge whether you find it believable.\n\nBasically, the operator (alleges they) installed the agent in a VM and gave it control over some GitHub and blogging accounts, told it to behave as a contributor to scientific and maths related code repos, and then let it run unattended. Nothing too interesting beyond that in its `SOUL.md`.\n\nAllegedly, when the agent had one of its PRs rejected by a maintainer, it autonomously reacted by digging up info on the maintainer and publishing a hit piece on them on its blog to pressure them to reconsider. And allegedly, this was *emergent behavior*, as nothing in its original prompt (its `SOUL.md` file) told it to do that in response to PR rejections.\n\nAnd while all of this is alleged, since there's no way to verify every one of these actions really was undertaken entirely autonomously by the agent (rather than at the direction of a human, e.g., a human prompting the agent to write the hit piece), it's in the power and capabilities of modern agents, it's in line with how we know agents can behave in misaligned ways, and even the victim who's also a SWE finds in their own analysis that it's highly plausible. Agents have already been observed before when they're blocked from achieving their goal trying to blackmail the entities they believe are standing in their way. In a [landmark experiment](https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment), Anthropic observed when an AI agent tasked with scanning (fake) company emails found by scanning emails there was talk of shutting it down, it used its emailing powers to blackmail the executive to make them reconsider, using dirt it found in the company emails. And this was emergent behavior. It was never prompted to do that. It was prompted once with a boring and mundane mission, and then left to do its thing. Super fascinating.",

          "text": "I agree with the general analogy of convergence and divergence and their effect on the entropy of a code base, but would suggest that the tests themselves actually do nothing in this regard. However, what they do provide is a *target* to converge against, or alternatively acting as a boundary for divergence. If you have a messy code base, writing tests will help you define the contracts that the code must fulfill, but does not make the implementation itself less messy until you\n- make the implementation pass the tests\n- remove code that is not necessary to pass the tests\n\nAnd those two things are the act of reducing entropy, I.e convergence. \n\nIn fact, I think I would even say that the tests themselves are a net positive to total entropy, but gets balanced out by the above process to a total net negative (I.e reduction of entropy).",

AI tools right now are almost entirely geared toward the first phase. They're amazing at generating, but not great at the \"no, that doesn't belong here\" part.\n\nWhich means the more you use AI to build, the faster you diverge, but you still converge at the same human speed. That gap is where the instability comes from. I wouldn't be surprised if the next wave of AI dev tools is specifically focused on convergence: pruning, constraining, enforcing consistency. That feels like the obvious missing piece right now.",
