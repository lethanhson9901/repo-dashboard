The guy had about 25 years of experience, so I e-mailed him back and said that I would definitely consider him but that I was trying to hire some junior guys first to balance out the team.\n\nThat afternoon I was pulled into a meeting with the VP of Engineering who told me to stop interviewing for juniors.  \"That's what outsourcing is for,\" he said.  I pointed out that if we don't hire juniors, they won't develop into seniors, and then what do we do in a few years when we start looking for seniors and there aren't any.

I think you probably have the pandemic schedule in mind, which was distorted.\n\nAnyway, I doubt that the code was good, but greenfield projects are easy for AI. It will punch out an MvP really fast. Then, when you get feature requests, maintenance, observability, shifting business directions and the like, you will realize that the code actually had bad abstractions, and even those bad abstractions were not fully followed and have leaked all over. You will have multiple places accessing S3 using the FileProcessor and the FileDownloader and the PdfGetter and, to add insult to injury, raw AWS API calls sprinkled in various places. Also, you should worry about security very hard because most LLMs don't give a fuck. I also take offense at you downplaying the added maintenance costs from this. I already had the displeasure of dealing with a codebase written mostly by AI like you described, and that was super reassuring. Good luck to anyone trying to run this for 6 months.\n\nI agree with you in spirit, though. Juniors are gone because people think that takes like yours make sense, and won't hire them. This will be a problem in 5-10 years. See you on the other side of this shitshow.",

My first job still had a punch card machine in a repurposed room. We used text editors, not IDEs. Implementation was painful, but juniors weren’t disposable code monkeys. We were treated as professionals in training.\n\nMy first task was a “benign” display bug. I was given time to explore so I could learn the system. In doing that, I found a deeper logic error affecting calculations. It was dismissed at first, then confirmed. That catch mattered because someone invested in letting a junior care and look closely.\n\nThat’s what I worry about losing, not typing speed. I don’t need juniors who grind out code that now can be generated. I need juniors who care about correctness, continuity, and the company surviving long enough to pay them.\n\nAI is just another tool. It can accelerate work. It can’t replace ownership.\n\nTo me the question is how do we preserve that sense of responsibility while tooling risks reducing the bench of skilled developers who can care.\n\nEven if your code can be generated and supported with minimal effort, at some point you will be on vacation when a critical change is needed. Or you may move on to new responsibilities or simply no longer be part of the company. Someone unfamiliar with the code regenerating it whole or trying to tweak it may be inefficient and ineffective. *That* is when the price of not having a bench of junior engineers will be realized.",

But a constriction in the job market for them is still significant news. Especially as it affects the downstream promotion to senior engineers a decade down the line.\n\nIf you hire 100k junior developers in 2010, maybe 25k of them will be senior by 2020 (totally arbitrary numbers to demonstrate a wider point). \n\nIf suddenly AI cuts that demand by even just 25%, that's a massive reduction in talent in the long run. That's the problem. Couple this with the fact that our largest demographic is currently in the process of retiring, it means the talent pool is getting squeezed from both ends, and talented senior software developers are going to get rarer and rarer, there is probably some maths you can do to work out the precise date in which they hit maximum rareness, given what we know about retirement rates, and layoff rates. \n\nMaybe give it a few years, and we're probably not going to see the number of senior software engineers notably increase again. That's it. The growth in this market has capped (at least in the west). Unless big tech is expecting AI to also fill the senior engineer gap, the number of humans doing this job is likely at its limit. This is a classic pipeline problem. Companies are saving money on hiring juniors now, and expecting seniors to just \"be there\" in the future, or perhaps not even thinking about it and they're totally short-sighted which really wouldn't surprise me.",

But the point is thousand hand drawn jobs were replaced with maybe hundred 2d digital animators. Same thing is happening with our industry. They don't need thousand sw engineers. They need maybe 2 senior engineers when there were maybe 10 engineers on the team. And no it's a myth that senior engineers cannot be hired if junior engineers don't get experience. There's already tons of engineers already trained and wanting jobs. No one needs to learn new and become a senior. There already are tons wanting jobs",

We're still dealing with the transition, figuring out the workflows, understanding how to effectively teach people, and determining what it even means to \"develop\" with an AI. \n\nEventually, we'll get all of those things sorted out, and when we've done that, do you think we'll be hiring old, crusty devs, super set in their ways, and willing to burn bridges to make everything suit their vision, which they will have before they even know what your product does?

That's probably the most important part of the post, I would say.\n\nJust one question: _where did the AI \"generated code\" come from?_\n\nSee, we're talking about language _models_ here. Huge amounts of actual code & comments in, lossily compressed into a neural whatever network (the model), then spit back out on request. There are quite a few documented cases of the AI spitting out the _exact same code_ as some repository somewhere. Without attribution, nor telling you the licence.\n\nSo unless we're ready to abandon copyright altogether (a valid political question), we probably should be wary of the answers the AI gives us, just because of the legal liability.",

Note I am not trying to judge success by any other metric, for example engineering or design taste or craftsmanship or code quality or resource efficiency or whatever the fuck.\n\nIs there an alternate universe where not-shipping would've worked out better? It's really, really hard to say. But the empirical evidence that shipping (even when laden with mistakes and wrong turns and dead ends) led to success, is a pretty good indication that not-shipping for fear of doing something fatally wrong is not actually a realistic risk. Is there a mythical alternate timeline where Google focused more and shipped less but somehow magically shipped the 1 True Perfect Product that would've led to even better results? Yeah maybe that's possible, but in the real world when dealing with uncertainty (no one is omniscient, no one knows the future), it's better to bias for action and ship everything, including your mistakes (and hopefully a few successes sneak in there as well).",

And then it is my understanding is if you work at google and you want to get promoted you have to release something to production.  So someone re-releases projects and often make them worse, but they don't care because they are chasing the promotion.  At that point, if the project was actually popular is has a user base and the only reason it keeps going is it still has enough of what made it good for people to put up with it.

This often leads to fewer bugs, including security bugs.\n\nMeanwhile, the only distinct advantage closed source has is security through obscurity, which is not much help even in the best of times.",

If the string contents are not mutated and length is rarely needed, such as when parsing, a single pointer into the string beats either base+offset with a length field stored somewhere, or position+remaining length. Having a current and end pointer works well, though; neither complex indexing nor needing to decrement the length for every increment in position. In files and network traffic, nul-termination has the advantage that you don't need to know the length before you begin writing.\n\nReally depends what operations you'll be doing most: Copying/concatinating the string contents with little care for the specific text within, or parsing the contents without needing to touch string as a whole.\n\nBut storing the length separately probably makes for a better default. Those who have a specific reason to opt for a non-default structure hopefully know what they're doing and can take the requisite care to avoid problems.",

This means that, roughly from version 3.6.0, any publicly-accessible MongoDB instance has been vulnerable to this.\n\nIt is unknown whether the exploit was known and exploited by actors prior to its disclosure. Given the simplicity of it, I bet it was.\n\nAs of the exploit’s disclosure, which happened on 19th of December, it has been a race to patch the database.\n\nSifting through Git history, it seems like the fix was initially committed on the 17th of December. It was merged a full 5 days after in the public repo - on the 22nd of December (1-line fix btw).\n\nThat beig said, MongoDB 8.0.17 containing the fix was released on Dec 19, consistent with the CVE publish data. While public JIRA activity shows that patches went out on the 22nd of December, I understand that Mongo develops in a private repository and only later syncs to the public one.\n\nIn any case - because there’s no official timeline posted, members of the community like me have to guess. As of writing, 10 days later in Dec 28, 2025, Mongo have still NOT properly addressed the issue publicly.\n\nThey only issued a community disclosure of the CVE a full five days after the publication of it. It is then, on the 24th of December, that they announced that all of their database instances in their cloud service Atlas were fully patched. Reading through online anecdotes, it seems like the service was patched days before the CVE was published. (e.g on the 18th)\n\nMongo says that they haven’t verified exploitation so far:\n\n“at this time, we have no evidence that this issue has been exploited or that any customer data has been compromised”",

In fact most drivers cannot beat a GPS, and almost no driver can beat a traffic aware GPS to a significant degree. Drivers feel this way because that's what they can control. We actually attempted to prove this to dispatchers and drivers and it ended up backfiring politically because the complaints started going to a different department.\n\nThe gulf is that the engineers do not understand the drivers jobs in reality AND they are intentionally mislead by management about those jobs in order for management to manipulate driver metrics.\n\nIn reality a lot of these complaints when you have the data to look into them stem from the fact that in order to meet some kind of target a person created an imputed value.\n\nThe target can be realistic or unrealistic. The imputed value can be realistic or unrealistic. These two variables are independent form each-other because the targets are created in aggergate but the imputed values are individual. Often the way you impute the individual value is too crude to make it realistic.\n\nFor example I need to hit $X money, that means I need to have Y deliveries, and I have Z shifts which means each shift needs to make Y/Z deliveries. Whether $X and Y are unrealistic doesn't matter here, because Y/Z is unrealistic because route efficiency and profitability cannot be \"averaged\" by impute, since it's a multiple traveling salesmen problem.\n\nThis is exactly the same thought process as assuming that a transition between each node on the map is equal cost simply because it's roughly equal distance.",

The turn penalty (smudging edges into curves) is essentially a low-pass filter for walking (reduce the super high frequency necessary to recreate sharp turns from sine waves.)\n\nThat's the Principle of Least Action in Physics. This is also why the Bekenstein Bound exists. It applies to the resolution of the floor grid. Too dense and you have created a Black Hole :D \n\nOptimising for the \"wrong thing\", just means we can't ignore Nature.\n\nBut I disagree with the interpretation of capitalism.

Microsoft made the case for Rust eons ago when they mentioned that [70% of the vulnerabilities in relevant code were memory-safety issues that Rust eliminates by design][microsoft-rust], and these numbers were [corroborated at the time by Mozilla][mozilla-rust] which Microsoft also cites, and as late as last year (2025 for those not paying attention), Google published a [detail statistical analysis of their own internal experience with Rust][google-rust]. Of course this number is significantly reduced in general terms, however that can easily be explained by the fact that most code isn't even written in any of the 3 languages mentioned in the article, so in the context where C++ is used, memory safety is still a huge deal, and of the 3 languages mentioned in the article, only Rust tackles it head-on.\n\n> Second, for the subset that is about programming language insecurity, the problem child is C, not C++.\n\nThe author sources their claims, but their source also states the following about the findings:\n\n> For starters, more code has been written than any other language, providing more opportunities for vulnerabilities to be discovered. The fact is that C has been in use for much longer than most other languages, and is behind the core of most of the products and platforms we use. As such, it is bound to have more known vulnerabilities than the rest.\n\nSo the source explicitly does not back the point that the author is trying to make, Rust isn't even there since most of the timespan analyzed by the source predates Rust 1.0, and C++26 isn't even part of the equation for obvious reasons.\n\n[microsoft-rust]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2019/07/why-rust-for-safe-systems-programming\n[mozilla-rust]: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/02/rewriting-a-browser-component-in-rust/\n[google-rust]: https://security.googleblog.com/2025/11/rust-in-android-move-fast-fix-things.html",

That should be 40% instead of 70% after the correction.\n\nThat 70% you talk about are bounds checks and the hardened C++ STL has it in C++26 (and had modes for years). Implicit contracts will move it to the language by recompilation. That removes 70% of vulnerabilities.\n\n\nWhy do you say those numbers are twisted and blindly believe reports that confirm your bias?\n\nThe big difference would be in lifetime bugs. And for these you have smart pointers (moving handling to runtime) and they account according to some reports for 2-3% of the bugs.\n\nWith warnings as errors you can even catch subsets of these and with clang tidy you can have even more static analysis.\n\n\nFor Rust proposers this safety is a huge deal. The truth is that in general, it is not at all except for the most hardened needs where these problems are disastrous and the borrow checker helps for that 2-3% or for making your code really difficult to refactor and less refactorable in many occasions but the most demanding scenarios. Those scenarios are not even measursble many times if you get the 80/20 rules.\n\n\nAs for vulnerabilities in general you are taking practices from codebases that are plagued with raw pointers and things considered anti-patterns by today standard because those codebases are old or started to be written long ago.\n\n\nSo that comparison is likely to be totally distorted. It os extremely difficult to use Windows APIs correctly, COM APIs, etc. from the OS, with things like int ** or int*** as parameters. Very crazy and totally unrepresentative. I take for granted that big amounts of errors come from ancient and bad practices and that if you take more modern codebases they will approach Rust levels of safety by a small delta.\n\nIf you use Rust with other things that need unsafety, probably the delta will be even smaller.",

Do they not raise reasonable doubt about the point made in the article?\n\n> The big difference would be in lifetime bugs. And for these you have smart pointers (moving handling to runtime) and they account according to some reports for 2-3% of the bugs.\n\nMoving handling to runtime kills performance, which defeats the point that the article is trying to make, because if performance is not a concern, then Swift should be added as a relevant language to the pool, and pretty much all other language becomes relevant outside of bare metal development. Also can you link to the reports that you mention?\n\n> With warnings as errors you can even catch subsets of these and with clang tidy you can have even more static analysis.\n\nThat don't get anywhere close to the level of safety offered by Rust's borrow checker.\n\n> For Rust proposers this safety is a huge deal. The truth is that in general, it is not at all except for the most hardened needs where these problems are disastrous.\n\nPerformance and safety are the main aspects being touted as highly relevant in the article, so promoting C++ specifically when those are actually the more than proven hallmarks of Rust is not exactly an unbiased opinion.\n\n> As for vulnerabilities in general you are taking practices from codebases that are plagued with raw pointers and things considered anti-patterns by today standard because those codebases are old or started to be written long ago.\n\nBecause that's the highly relevant case of all the C and C++ codebases that the author conveniently ignores when it counters their point. One of the claims that they make is that the big problem is actually C, and to prove that they cite a source from 2019 with 10 years of statistical evidence where neither C++26 nor Rust are present, and the source itself makes the statement that the significant number of reported vulnerabilities in C code stems from C being the language used most in critical software components by a huge margin, so this source does in no way back the correlations that the author is using to make a point about the growth of both C++ and Rust.\n\n> So that comparison is likely to be totally distorted. It os extremely difficult to use Windows APIs correctly, COM APIs, etc. from the OS, with things like int ** or int*** as parameters. Very crazy and totally unrepresentative.\n\nI actually think that they are totally representative of reality, which is the only relevant source of information when it comes to explaining statistical data.",

Some people will use it for other things because they are comfortable with it and don't consider it a hindrance, but the main goal of Rust should be to provide safe underpinnings for our software world, and replace as much C/C++ as possible, as quickly as possible.\n\nA lot of that won't involve REwrites, it'll just involve writes.

No two projects are the same anyways and it depends a lot. \n\nMany of the people that say C++ is bad or flawed give simple and unrepresentative examples of what could happen with C-style code nonsense that noone is writing anymore. \n\nWell trained C++ programmers have been writing more robust styles for the last 15 years easily if not longer. RAII is pre-C++11 and shared_ptr existed in Boost pre-C++11.\n\nAlso, many of the complaints I saw about the language have already been fixed or have warnings in compilers, which you can and should be set as errors by default.\n\nFor example, returning a pointer from a local from the stack is in theory allowed, but compilers will not let you do it. This can be applied to narrowing conversions and a ton of things, increasing safety and correctness (namely, compilers are better and safer than the ISO standard strictly speaking).\n\n Even to a subset of lifetime analysis (this one is still quite worse than Rust, but dẻtcts many cases). All this, paired with value-oriented programming and smart pointers makes C++ a language that is quite safe. C++26 includes standard library hardening as well... Value semantics eliminate a lot of the need for lifetime handling.\n\nC++ in the average case does not have a big problem with safety. It does need improvements standard-wise but it is not that unsafe when used with a few patterns that are not that difficult to remember.\n\nIt does have a few footguns though with string_view and others and you have to be conservative about how you use that or capture in lambdas that will be invoked in another scope.

Are there ways to do that? Yes, there are ways. Most devs are living in a myopic world of whatever languages and systems they are taught and then act like they know-it-all. They don't. That's a fantasy. They never ask questions. They merely assume that what they know is all that there is to know and nothing better exists. Instead, they treat their languages and systems like a religion and themselves as high priest converts. It's pathological. And management? They could care less about our tech-religions.

It's fundamentally an implementation of the memoryless exponential decay function. Stochastically speaking, for every extra dollar earned, you roll the die. The odds stay the same, and to survive 1 Billion roles becomes extremely rare, not impossible, but rare. A handful of people become rich, while the majority 97% won't go past the 80K income barrier. In other words, the billionaire income bracket can only exist, because 97% of the population stays ultimately poor (without property). Once you are in that region, you no longer operate under the laws of competition like the rest, where losing a job or getting sick means game over. From here on, it's compound interests and family trusts. You have successfully isolated yourself from the chaos of competition, for generations to come.\n\nTo apply a moralistic worldview to a system that doesn't operate on morals is a huge (categorical) mistake. You are basically using god to explain gravity.\n\nNobody cares for \"good\" code, \"good\" products, if, what ever a worker creates, doesn't generate profits, then this work becomes worthless for a company. How do companies know if their workers are profitable? When the competing capitalists find a way to become more profitable, when they found a way to extract more value out of their workers, i.e. by producing more with fewer people. Salaries are diluted profits.\n\nThat's why capitalism is a class-system in disguise. Legally, you're not a medieval serf, but operationally the role of a wageworker is to function as a source for profits like in historic times. For a while, engineers made good money because they build the systems that would make others redundant (warehouse workers) and companies more profitable (Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon). Now, it's the engineers them self selves that face the consequences of profit optimization. \n\nDoes this system create logical tensions, poverty and war: yes. Does it matter? No, because it's not about logic or moral beliefs, it's about surviving under competition and winning the game.",

Med device companies are usually managed by bean counters, not by engineers.  And a side effect of all the bureaucracy is that you end up shipping code with hundreds of known and already-fixed bugs that didn't make it into the formal build.\n\nFDA auditors rarely have any domain expertise in software,  so they usually only look at whether the paperwork looks like it was completed properly.

The commit ultimately has your name on it, why would you turn in something less than what you're capable of?\n\n> Why do I need to write the same high-level language in a different way than I did a year ago\n\nDo you actually need to do it in a different way?\n\n> when I was producing plenty of code that delivered plenty of business value\n\nHere it is. This is the source of confusion. If you were producing quality code, then you probably don't need to change. However, don't forget that there are legions of bad software developers who were not putting out quality code, and so AI is not actually worse than what they would have done.\n\n> Why do we need to reinvent the wheel again and again?\n\nWhy do we even need computers when people can do this by hand?",

The part yearning for more features will (and should?) never be the part that advocates stability, it’s not what it’s for. What I see lacking is a proper discussion at that level so that the (necessary) tradeoffs are made in the open. And I don’t think that counterpart is ever ground-level developers simply due to difference in power. I have seen this in at least partial action and know there’s a way but also agree that the current common approach is not that.\n\nI also slightly disagree with #2 because software is never done so the backlog is always infinite and that asking for more time should simply not be a thing (acknowledging that it very often still is). As a dev ”done” is *your* call, not anybody else’s. Here I’d blame dev culture/community and not really business (they just take advantage of it) for not boosting the pride and responsibility in being the one who gets shit ”done”. E.g. testing is part of ”done”, not something added to a dev produces.\n\nBottom line, though, I do agree with a severe lack of craftmanship in the software business even if I personally am able to carve out the space-time I need to deliver to my best ability. I see myself as a Software Craftsman, inspired by The Pragmatic Programmer, and try to empower devs around me to accept and fulfill the role as I see it. Through my years I’ve worked with and observed quite a few fellow craftsmen but sadly never in large enough numbers or concentration to truly deliver the software we should be enjoying.\n\nSo finally, I’m not attending this funeral but calling out for my fellow kind to stay true and spread the word; software is a craft and in craft there is pride!",

Then there's the weird spacing choices around operators in an expression.\n\nIt's still better than in a lot of other languages (looking at you Python) in which there are 10 tools to do the same with no consistency.

No \"make illegal states unrepresentable\" there.\n\nSo some \"can I do this?\" questions wind up with either needing to check some docstrings in the kubernetes API reference, or just sending it to a server and seeing if it rejects it. At least schema validators like `kubeconform` help.\n\nIt also bugs me that since Go is the ur-language for Kubernetes, the API in other languages winds up being just recreations of that, rather than actually utilising language features that would make it more ergonomic and correctness-enforcing.",

This text file has no particular legal or technical authority, and it’s not even particularly complicated. It represents a handshake deal between some of the earliest pioneers of the internet to respect each other’s wishes and build the internet in a way that benefitted everybody. It’s a mini constitution for the internet, written in code.\n\nIt’s called robots.txt and is usually located at yourwebsite.com/robots.txt. That file allows anyone who runs a website — big or small, cooking blog or multinational corporation — to tell the web who’s allowed in and who isn’t. Which search engines can index your site? What archival projects can grab a version of your page and save it? Can competitors keep tabs on your pages for their own files? You get to decide and declare that to the web.\n\nIt’s not a perfect system, but it works. Used to, anyway. For decades, the main focus of robots.txt was on search engines; you’d let them scrape your site and in exchange they’d promise to send people back to you. Now AI has changed the equation: companies around the web are using your site and its data to build massive sets of training data, in order to build models and products that may not acknowledge your existence at all.\n\nWe made this article free to read for the rest of the day: https://www.theverge.com/24067997/robots-txt-ai-text-file-web-crawlers-spiders",

I remember pushing an idea to lean more into merging and the wiki concept, where questions would stay open but feed into a wider group of similar problems with canonical answers that apply generally across a range. In the end, they leaned heavily into the \"one right answer\" approach, and we see that in how toxic it became.\n\nNowadays, I still think it *could* be a great platform, but it looks like Fog Creek and Joel Spolsky got out at the right time because it's been utterly gutted since then.",

Not because my core issue was inappropriate, but because the other mods didn't like how I phrased it.\n\nEven in [my most banal of interactions on Meta StackExchange](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/posts/371191/revisions), I've received [strangely strong pushback](https://imgur.com/a/jyhR0Uy) just because I didn't know what went on behind closed doors.\n\nI would smurf sometimes, making a new account and asking the same kinda questions under that one.

They just have to not be a little bitch about it.\n\nInterestingly, some of the candidates we've interviewed were convinced by their teachers to never use AI (which makes sense, because it undermines the value of the teacher.)

It depends a lot on the application how useful AI is imo BUT I always think AI is far more useful for senior developers.\n\nAs an example, a junior guy at work just figured out how to use co-pilot and it's a very mixed bag. On one hand, the code that he produced was FAR better but on the other hand, the logic of his code was horrible and due to producing more code than normal, it took me far longer to go through is PR and spot all the mistakes he had made.\n\nMe on the other hand, on projects where AI works well, I have probably worked twice as fast, with a bit better code but a lot better documented and united + integration tested. My 2 fellow senior developers that are working on the same application are also writing code using AI and for most of it, you'd not be able to spot whom of us did what.\n\nI definitely think the value is far greater for senior developers but the good part for junior developers is that their code will no longer stick out like a sore thumb and the more you set up your codebase to be easy on AI and reviewers, the better it will be for both juniors and seniors.",

Not overly complicated, but it was supposed to be a solution to a bug. Was it a solution? No, not at all. It was this insane, overly defensive custom event listener crafted to hook a secure function, if ever called, to check the output of the other function called, and if the output was wrong in several conditions, to rewrite the output. And still, it didn't really account for edge cases or why the fix needed to be implemented to begin with, and it also would fail if load order was not considered in some circumstances. \n\nIt didn't resolve the source of the bug which is what was wanted. Boolean gating it away downstream so no errors get thrown is not a fix!\n\nThe LLM solution was actually fairly sound, logically, but no actual human would write it because it was so much work where the coder would quickly realize how stupid of an implementation this was.\n\nThe actual solution was literally a single line fix and the LLM failed because they didn't prompt with full context.\n\nI am just thinking of all these companies that are just committing all this trash bloated AI slop and how much if a mess it is going to make for them that they can't just LLM their way out of. I say this as someone who loves using AI to speed up my work and clarify things, debug, and so on. But man, I know how flawed it is. You have to know what to throw out and when it's not reliable.",

A junior + an LLM can reduce the signal:noise ratio of your PR queue until it's absolutely useless.\n\nA *senior* can also do that, but as a senior they are going to go back and forth **much more** with the LLM than read the code, hits the \"LGTM, create PR\" button and move on.\n\nI've looked at projects that people (here and on HN, I think) claimed was done by the LLM to a high quality, and without fail it was either:\n\n1. A very small codebase, or\n2. Horribly over-engineered (a 100k LoC project for a journal that integrates with the calendar, slack and email). That 100K doesn't count the code in the framework, BTW.\n\nWhen I look at what people are claiming as their productivity output, when they also claim \"having 20 years of experience\", I shake my head - no way would I pass that code in a review.\n\nThe only way I get really good code from an LLM is by a proper back and forth (pushing back on quite a lot of what it gives, and questioning the rationale for quite a lot of what it gives).\n\nHalf the time, you give the code back to the LLM and ask a pointed question like \"That looks horribly over-engineered\", they **will** respond with \"You're absolutely right\" and then proceed to change it.\n\nIf *even the LLM* can review the code and say \"Whoops, I made a boo-boo\", why aren't the \"seniors\" doing it? You can't review more than a few thousands of lines of code per day, so having the LLM spit out 20k lines/day means effectively no reviewing will be done.",

Instead of spending hours writing thousands of lines of code or searching Stack Overflow for syntax, engineers can use AI tools to handle the boring stuff.\n\n**The fallacy is that basic work being done today somehow \"doesn't count\".  When it absolutely, 100% counts.**\n\nI'll use another industry as the example.  Landscaping.  Lets say you found a perfect AI driven lawnmower.  All you have to do is drop it off at a home/office building, let it do it's thing, then pick it up an hour later, and it drives itself right back onto your truck.\n\nYou tell your staff \"hey guys, you don't have to worry about the 'grunt work' of mowing lawns anymore! You can do the more detailed work of planting flowers, trimming hedges, and things like that! Won't that be great!\"\n\nBut... 60% of your workers time is currently spent mowing lawns.  Sure - is the other work more interesting, and more skilled?  Of course, but... so what?  You just took away 60% of their work!!!  That's what they got paid to do! You don't need 50 landscapers on staff anymore.  Your 30 lawn mowers are replaced by 5 guys who just deliver AI lawnmowers to locations.\n\nThat's what's happening here.  Saying \"you don't have to do the boring stuff\" anymore is STUPID because we currently *get paid* to do the \"boring stuff.\"  When you take that away, you take work away.  You *take jobs away.* \n\nSo sure, it will only be the \"interesting\" stuff left, but... it will be the \"interesting\" stuff left for the 30% of remaining employees.  That 70% that get fired aren't going to feel comforted that their buddy Jim who still has a job has a more interesting job than he used to.",

By ingesting the data and learning from it AI is now a better tool than Stackoverflow could ever be and the company is completely doomed and will go out of business. \n\nNow we see the same thing happening. \"It's temporary\" \"It's no zirp\" \"Hey why aren't the jobs coming back?\". The jobs aren't coming back because of AI. More jobs will go because of AI. \"But what happens in X years when there isn't a new wave of senior devs because they stopped hiring jrs?\" Guess what buddy, AI. Lil timmy cs grad doesn't get exponentially better every year, claude does. \n\nAs long as the rate of improvement continues there is no reason to hire ANY jrs. And the rate will continue. Programming is especially vulnerable to AI automation because many parts of the process is automatically verifiable, and thus suitable to reinforcement learning, and attractive for automation, because automation may lead to self improvement and acceleration of further AI.\n\nTLDR: 1.

Infix addition is very abstract, but it’s broadly shared, so we don’t need to understand all the leaks or how to make an adder circuit.   Broadly shared and understood abstractions are “simple” (files, processes, functions) while detailed concrete implementations  are “complex” - (file SYSTEMs, process managers, VMs)\n\n\n2. Single-ness -> Multiplicity\n\nThe one that Rich is mostly talking about:  a single thing does a single thing, there isn’t state threaded through the whole call, the function takes some arguments, returns a value, the function has a single observable side effect.  Your data holds data not data AND behavior. \n\n3. Straightforward -> Toilsome\n\nHow much bullshit typing to do I have to do to do the thing?  Like one-to-many relations in databases are sort of obnoxious, you have to specify / type the same-ish thing a whole bunch.  Rails has “belongs_to” which is straightforward as hell and also fronts an enormous amount of “magic”\n\nLike a lot of things it’s a three-way tradeoff - and how making one dimension “better” necessarily makes another dimension “worse”",

But at the very least, it provides a human touch, and there are often insightful discussions in the comments which provide essential context. \n\nAI seems like StackOverflow but worse (in the negative consequences).\n\n> 2.

Keeps writing code when I'm gassed out and need to keep momentum going.\n\nOr how about take a break? If I try to code when gassed, my code goes to shit because my judgement is severely compromised. Throwing an AI into the mix, I wouldn't trust my ability to review the code. Similar to how ability to do quality code reviews goes out the window and if I'm tired enough, I'll approve anything.\n\n> 4.

What and how I use AI models for today is completely different than 6 months ago. Previously it was autocomplete and answering simple questions like “what does this line do?”  Now it’s analyzing entire code bases, running code reviews, RCAs, generating multi media documentation, and even working through complex tickets. That’s not without a decent chunk of work on my end though. It takes preparation and understanding of what the tools can do, what they can’t do, and when and why they fail. It often comes down to three core areas. Context, tooling, and process. If one of those is lacking then it doesn’t matter how great the other two are. Your results will be disappointing.",

Erosion of the \"Power Process\"\n\nKaczynski argued humans have a biological need for the power process: setting a goal, exerting effort, and achieving it autonomously. \n\nAI Extrapolation: By 2026, Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialized agents have reached a level where they handle complex decision-making and creative tasks. Kaczynski would argue this leads to de-skilling, where humans lose the capacity for critical thinking and problem-solving, rendering their lives unfulfilling and dependent on machines. \n\n2. Rise of \"Surrogate Activities\"\n\nThe manifesto describes surrogate activities as artificial goals (hobbies, entertainment, careerism) that people pursue because the system has solved their basic survival needs. \n\nAI Extrapolation: AI acts as an infinite engine for these activities, generating personalized content, social simulations, and gamified tasks that keep the population distracted and docile. This prevents people from recognizing their lack of true power over the technological system. \n\n3. Technological Slavery and Inevitability\n\nKaczynski predicted that as machines become more intelligent, humans will let them make more decisions because machine-made results are \"better\". \n\nAI Extrapolation: Eventually, the system becomes so complex that human beings are incapable of making decisions intelligently to keep it running. In 2026, the deep integration of AI into infrastructure, finance, and healthcare means society cannot simply \"turn it off\" without committing collective suicide, effectively putting the machines in control. \n\n4. Human Adjustment to the System\n\nA key claim of the manifesto is that humans must adjust to the needs of the system rather than the system adjusting to humans. \n\nAI Extrapolation: Modern concerns regarding algorithmic control and surveillance capitalism mirror Kaczynski's warning. Humans in 2026 often modify their behavior to remain \"legible\" or favored by algorithms—whether for social media visibility or workplace productivity—becoming mere \"cogs\" in a digital social machine. \n\n5. Failure of Reform\n\nKaczynski believed the technological system is an indivisible whole that cannot be reformed piece-meal. \n\nAI Extrapolation: He would likely view 2026's ethical AI frameworks and safety regulations as superficial distractions that only serve to further integrate the technology into the fabric of society rather than challenging its fundamental dominance. \n\nFood for thought?",

It is only impossible if you hard reject all invalid routes, which only a few Tier 1 provider do. Smaller providers might give invalids a bad MED, but will still accept the route, which does nothing if the announced route by a rogue operator is a /24 and is in fact most specific.  It is not hardcoded into BGP, it is a policy you CAN add if you run your own routinator and connect it to your router.\n\nKeep also in mind that you cannot add RPKI to legacy networks and transferring them to a RIR lowers their value significantly. So that is not happening either.\n\nAs a Network Engineer, I hate that some sites have added a RPKI check to their \"safety\" tools, but without any context. Since some sites do this, I have to answer a dozen of mails each month why some subnets in our network do not have RPKI.",

So it's not exactly apples to apples. Also worth mentioning: some of the GPU algorithms I used aren't even theoretically optimal. Bitonic sort is O(n log²n) vs quicksort's O(n log n). On a single core, bitonic sort is actually worse. It only makes sense because it parallelizes well on GPU - every comparison is independent so you can throw thousands of threads at it. So really this is more \"single-threaded SQLite vs parallel GPU with algorithms chosen specifically because they parallelize\" rather than \"CPU vs GPU\" in general. A multi-core CPU implementation with proper algorithms would definitely close the gap.The unified memory thing is still real though on a discrete GPU I'd have to add transfer time on top of everything.",

No one will ever just interleave IO and computation sequentially when there is more data to retrieve, that is just a bad implementation.\n\nthe only other question is how much calculation you need to fill up the IO time.  it's possible your simple summations etc are not complex enough and you'll still end up waiting on IO.

I haven't play around with GPU computational stuff much, but I think CUDA has an API for loading directly to the GPU (cuFileRead/Write going by memory). On the hardware level, doing DMA from  NVMe -> GPU is a thing. \n\nHaving the DB in memory and being able to operate it on both with the CPU and GPU without any copy overhead in a shared memory system definitely has a lot more possibilities. I'm a little surprised that is viable in practical. Both storing data in the same way,  being able to access it using it both interchangabily. I won't how common this is, is just an Apple thing.  Does this handle r/w operations or just read - cache-coherency issues come to mind?\n\n**edit**\nDoing some googling, CUDA has a system that lets you do this shared memory storage as well: https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/using-shared-memory-cuda-cc/ .

If everyone wants to cooperate and play “fair” it can work better than having everyone infighting, but if one person is being ruthless and selfish they gain an advantage over everyone else and the only way to counter it is to fight fire with fire.\n\nOnce a company hits a certain size you’re guaranteed to have at least one person like that, so that cutthroat culture becomes hard to avoid.\n\nI also think something like Dunbar’s number plays into it a bit as well (theory that humans brains can only maintain around 150 relationships). I think that as a company grows our brains can’t maintain the human relationships as well and so it’s easier to act ruthlessly. Basically, a laying off 5 people from a 50 person company is tougher decision than a laying off 500 people from a 5000 person company because at a 50 person company the person making the decision likely knows those people personally and sees them as real people. At a 5000 person company most of the people being laid off are just names on a list.",

          "text": "Here is my complete and honest take on this.\n\nStart with some basic assumptions: 1) We are all trying to look out for ourselves, which usually means earn money and often means further our career, and many if not most of us are trying to do good work while we're at it, but not everyone. 2) Most of us need to work cooperatively to accomplish things that are useful on a scale large enough to accomplish the above goals, and even more so for anyone who wants to have any sort of real, widespread impact; we're simply past the era where groundbreaking stuff can often be done by one person or even two or three - while it does happen, it's rare as hen's teeth.\n\nSo we end up organizing into, well, organizations. Of some sort. In this case we're talking companies, whether startups or the most valuable companies in the world or somewhere in between. With a handful of us, or a few dozen, or five hundred, or a few thousand, we can ship really cool stuff to the public that also gets us paid enough to be happy with it.\n\nAny org in a company can be sorted, I think, into roughly four classifications that are relevant to this article. They look a lot like the prisoner's dilemma...\n\nOne: The clockwork org: well funded, well staffed, problem is well understood, people work together pretty well and good work simply ticks out like clockwork. Every year there's a new X that everyone loves, or every six months there's a major improvement to Y product everyone pays for and/or everyone uses, or there are simply consistent and incremental improvements to a ubiquitous product, or every day customers are satisfied because issues are resolved, or every year or two something really neat and novel comes out that people love, or whatever it is. These orgs like any other have climbers, but most people are in it to win it from a collective point of view, working hard to benefit the whole and feeling happy with their personal acknowledgement and reward (probably pay, but not always.) There's not a lot of pressure to sharpen knives because there just aren't that many people trying to step on your or stab you in the back, most effort is spent on cooperation vs the backstabbing part of the prisoner's dilemma.\n\nTwo: The org that desperately needs a win because it's going to be an enormous win, and everyone is licking their chops at getting personally rewarded for that win... especially if they are at the top of the pile when it happens. This is the exact opposite of the first one. People spend far more effort on politicking and backstabbing and stepping and re-orging and climbing than they spend on simply delivering success. This is basically the roulette table where each player gets told that if he stabs the guy next to him at the table he simultaneously improves his payout while reducing his odds of getting the payout and does the math (or thinks he does the math) and finds that the utility of doing so is greater than 1 because the increase of payout to the sole winner is 100x while the reduction in chance is only like 5%... but then half the players at the table whip their knives out. You know what happens here? Usually nobody wins, but a lot of people lose.\n\nThree and four: the two orgs above except with the opposite perspectives (the slam-dunk product org filled with backstabbing that often kills it, and the moonshot org where everyone works cooperatively and are happy to share in riches if they win.) Three is sadly common, four is unfortunately fairly rare. Startups think they're the fourth kind, until there's real money involved (a startup exit) and then far too often everyone except for one or two or three people find out that they've been diluted to zero in some backroom game and stabbed in the back at the finish line rather than it being a constant the entire time.\n\nOP, your group was (2). There were multiple orgs who were chasing ML and none of them had a real success to their name as far as the market, investors, board, etc were concerned. Everyone spent far more time jockeying for position than delivering a fucking product that worked. It got multiple of your management chain fired (\"retired\", whatever.) You were in the middle of it. You weren't playing the game, other people were just playing you. And of course you spent a long long time coasting, which is part of why the org failed to deliver - there were many like you who didn't do much for months and management was blind to it, willfully or incompetently. (Much harder to get away with that in a clockwork org, people generally understand what is getting produced by each person on a regular basis, though of course plenty still manage.) It all sucks, you would hope that any company wouldn't have this sort of sheer incompetence in what they see as a must-do project, but it happens.\n\nFor what it's worth, I know quite a few people who work there at clockwork orgs. Yes everyone is always busy and their thing is more important than your thing and yes people would like to have more than they currently have but for the most part relations are cordial even if a bit tight and products ship on time and people buy them by the truck-full every day. If you transferred internally to an org that constantly delivers value, visibly, every year, multiple times a year, you woulda found a much better environment. Lumping together all large corporations is tempting but not only are they different team-by-team, but also vp/exec by vp/exec, and of course quite different from each other as well. In any case, hopefully you enjoy what you're doing now quite a lot more, it sucks to spend 8+ hours a day not enjoying it.",

I also agree the piece leans toward the darker end of the spectrum — that was intentional — though it’s fair feedback that clearer counterexamples could sharpen the contrast.\n\nWhere I disagree is with the takeaway that this is mainly about “playing the game better” or transferring sooner. Those may be individually rational moves, but they don’t address the underlying mechanism the essay is wrestling with: why so much energy gets wasted on internal conflict in the first place, and under what conditions that becomes the dominant mode.\n\nThe prisoner’s dilemma is a useful intuition, but it’s too coarse to explain real human dynamics.

It's a combination of upper management having a lack of vision, inability to organize the work to make sure it actually happens, and tolerance for net-negative politicking beneath them, often because they themselves are engaged in net-negative politicking. It's almost not interesting to diagnose the problem because the first half of the solution is easy enough - fire the management that allows this - but the second half is devilishly difficult, which is to find new management that is able to take on a 'moonshot' org with incredible potential returns and a ton of pressure without turning it into a backstab hotbed where everyone is busy climbing to get those incredible rewards rather than doing the work that actually unlocks the rewards.",

Customers talk to customer support which talk to product owners which talk to QA which talk to dev leads which finally talk to devs? How many levels of indirection are we talking about here? Can we improve it by adding a few more layers of middle management? If devs are allowed to have full ownership of their software from design to rollout, they will want product and customer support leads to be their slack channels and to have them participate in standups. So that they don't have to rely on chinese whispers to understand what the customers want and what the pain points are. And product and customer support want that too: any dev who's ever had to work with first level support of an external supplier knows that 50% of problems can be solved quickly and easily if you just get to talk to one of their devs directly. Your company doesn't understand async communication and that devs don't have to drop everything every time a message is sent in slack? That sounds like a you problem.\n\n>since many of them aren't even technically inclined people. \n\nThey aren't retarded just because they didn't become devs themselves. If you talked to them you'd see that they are most likey intelligent people who want to excel at their job. Even their feeble minds can learn how to operate high tech like an \"issue tracker\" if you take five minutes to explain it to them. And if they can't? If they've been at the company for 20 years and refuse to learn anything other than email? Maybe it's time for them to move on.\n\nAs for github discussions in particular: One of the few value propositions that github's tech stack has over gitlab is that their search is much better. In particular, issues and pull requests are integrated. You can just remove the `is:pr` from the search bar and run a search across both. This makes it much easier for devs and users to find the places where a keyword was referenced. Discussions ruin this because they are not integrated at all. You have to remember to run at least two queries every time. You might not like it, but Jira solved this issue a long time ago with their highly advanced, sql-like search that can search across the entire jira instance at once. Github discussions are a step backwards in terms of dev-exp and user-exp.\n\nAnd even if they were integrated, it would just be a glorified way to tag issues. Devs are unable to find those issues that are ready for implementation? Here's an idea: click the \"add tag: ready-for-implementation\" button instead of the \"convert to issue\" button.",

If you try to implement all of that, you end up with a spaghettified mess. If you try to sort through it, you will spend ALOT of time on that task alone. Developer time is *fucking expensive*, and defending roadmap sanity from feature-creep is not a cost-effectove use of that time.\n\n**b) The assumption that \"pain points\" identified by customers are b.1) real or b.2) actionable by devs**\n\nI have worked my way from low-level tech support to senior software engineer. I have had calls at 3AM because \"the system is down\", which then turned out to be some genius being unable to tell whether his fucking VPN was connected or not. I have had stakeholders ask me to fix that the app \"feels sluggish\"...the app in question being **their** companies crappy implementation against our backend. I have wasted hours of my life slogging through logfiles looking for alleged bugs, that turned out to be misconfigured firewalls.\n\nMost things customers, or stakeholders, perceive as pain points that a dev should fix, are caused by infra, environment, user error, or a combination of those.\n\nAs for b.2), even if a problem is actually real, 7/10 \"bug reports\" or \"issues\" are various iterations on *\"this does not work please halp!\"*. What doesn't work? What have you tried? When did it fail? How? What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? Even simple things like *\"What version of the software are you running and what's your OS?\"* are often information we only get after asking for the umpteenth time. Ever asked yourself why so many issue trackers include a template, complete with command lines to copypaste to provide essential data? *BECAUSE PEOPLE GET IT WRONG ALL THE TIME*. And even with the templates, they still get it wrong too often for comfort.\n\nMaking sure this mess is fixed, and I am gonna repeat myself here, *is not an effective use of a devs time*. A dev should get a bug report, written by someone who knows what that entails, with all the required info, preferably *AFTER* someone made sure that the perceived bug isn't actually some genius trying to run the service on a Debian installation that was last updated when vikings roamed the coast of England.\n\n> any dev who's ever had to work with first level support of an external supplier knows that 50% of problems can be solved quickly and easily if you just get to talk to one of their devs directly.\n\nQuickly and easily **FOR WHOM?**\n\nFor the customer? Sure, because the dev has more knowledge about the software than a support technician.\n\nFor the devs, this is hell on earth. I worked in shops where devs had to do 1st level support. The only thing that would beat this shit as a productivity killer, would be Pai Mei from \"Kill Bill\" standing behind me, hitting me over the head with his stick at random intervals.\n\nServing the customer is a noble goal, but when it kills dev productivity (and again, dev time is *fuckin expensive*), that's a problem that should be addressed post-haste.\n\n> Your company doesn't understand async communication and that devs don't have to drop everything every time a message is sent in slack? That sounds like a you problem.\n\nMy company understands how expensive dev time is, and how important filtering is to use this expensive resource effectively. If anyone doesn't, well, that sounds like a their-problem.",

Everyone else has perfectly fine git server hosting, if you use PRs/MRs they all work fine on each. Issues are barely a value proposition unless you won't pay for better, and even then I think other free options are fine. GitHub actions is, commercially successful, but I don't think it's actually good, though in fairness many of their competitors are legitimately worse. Especially wrt billing. And the network effects are kinda whatever, it's meaningless for private repos and I don't know whether people benefit from discoverability or if they just get more spam.\n\nGithub is weird, there are a lot of features that are  there but seem abandoned. Wikis and pages could both be slam-dunks but there's enough friction that most people will go their separate ways. Honestly given that github seems to think that copilot is their most important product I'm a little surprised they haven't given wikis some love, given that I think they would love if copilot could pull all your wikis, plus they would get to stick one to notion.",

There is a tradeoff though because it uses more CPU, and you have to do a bunch of performance testing to see if it's really better when turning it on. It also had a bunch of CVEs which delayed adoption. So a lot of large projects haven't adopted it because of the security aspect. It avoids system calls and lets you read/write directly to a buffer in kernel memory. Also, processes that use it need specific permissions from the OS, so it's not as plug and play as just running a regular Java process. Oh yeah and a lot of popular Linux OS don't have a new enough kernel to take advantage of the full io_uring API. Overall, it's still new enough that it's going to take a while before we start seeing it used more. My guess would be 3-5 years.",

If another strncpy copies from name to another buffer of a larger size, that second copy is capable of copying elements of next element of the struct, address. If the next element of the struct is supposed to be secret, that's bad.\n\nThis makes the function a violation of Postel's law: \"Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you emit.\" The function implicitly requires either that num be the minimum of the source / destination buffer length or null terminated strings, but does not ensure that the output is null terminated.\n\nI grant that this saves one byte in each field, but I don't feel this is a worthwhile tradeoff. I'm already using a memory allocator that uses 16-31ish bytes for bookkeeping and padding for each allocation. Wasting a byte per string is a rounding error.\n\n>And it pads with zeros to guarantee that you don't leak uninitialized memory.\n\nI disagree that this is a useful thing for the string copy function to ensure.\n\nI don't feel like I'm consistent enough to remember to initialize every field of a struct - I would rather `memset()` the struct before use or `calloc()` it than try to ensure that I have remembered to initialize each field. (Note that due to structure padding, initializing every field of a struct is not guaranteed to initialize every byte of a struct.)\n\nIn most cases, the compiler can prove that this `memset()` is a dead store anyway, so this has no performance cost if I've remembered to initialize every field.",

                  "text": "C++ enables significantly more complex programs than C did. If I recall correctly, the C application I was maintaining back in the day was 40-60K lines of code and any given run through the code would interact with 10-15K lines of code tops. Old Timey C also has some well-tested and used tools to analyze what the code is doing. Once I got done with the low-hanging fruit in our stability refactor, I found the various malloc and use-after free errors by building the code with [Electric Fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Fence) and running it against some problematic files we'd encountered. The system was very deterministic in its bugs -- if a file caused a crash the first time it was processed, it was more or less guaranteed to always cause a crash.\n\n\nPretty much all the C++ code I write is heavily threaded and most of the weirdness stems from threading issues rather than the traditional memory issues that C was known for. Even with the unit tests that no one ever wrote in the C days, I might have the threads line up in just the right way 1% of the time and expose a place where I should have been using a mutex to synchronize memory access. I was just looking at a fun little bug the other day where I was breaking database loading for a graph up into individual data objects and dispatching loads to a thread pool and I needed to find a place to put a consistently correct \"This load is done\" signal. I had to make a pretty significant change to my design in order to do that because it was literally impossible with my original implementation. I ended up delaying submission of all the nodes to be processed until after the routine had examined the entire graph, because otherwise it would queue up a node that would get processed prior to adding any more, and the system would think it was done.\n\n\nI can't reason about every single execution branch in a system like that, and we're writing more and more systems like that. At best the language you use can force you into safer practices, but I think it can also lull you into a false sense of security because you might start to think you can write code at this level of complexity without really knowing about things like memory synchronization that you explicitly have to think about when using a language like C++. There isn't a silver bullet that can insure that you don't have to think about things like that, because for all that the compiler knows about the code, it still doesn't think about every single interaction that code could end up having. Java was suppose to be that silver bullet too, back in the late '90's, and we saw how well that went. Rust is just history repeating itself in that respect.\n\n\nIf you're curious about my graph code you can find it [here](https://github.com/FlyingRhenquest/RequirementsManager). I'm current wrapping up a [Imgui Node Editor](https://github.com/FlyingRhenquest/ImguiWidgets) to create and edit graphs of those nodes. It's probably pretty solid for single user use, but currently if two users are editing the same graph at the same time, it's very likely that one will overwrite the node information of the other when they try to write back to the database. I can mitigate that to a degree by keeping track of which nodes are modified, but that would require modifying all the node getters and setters to set a changed flag. I could even make that more granular and keep track of individual fields in a node if I want to, but I'd probably want to go to code generation (which I also have a [project](https://github.com/FlyingRhenquest/codegen) for) if I'm going to try to do that. I'm not sure if I really want my nodes to be that complex at this point, though.",

Mid-2024 to today? I can probably count those visits on my fingers without repeating any. \n\nStackOverflow started going downhill when the mods started power tripping in the mid 10's. You'd post an important question and some mod would shut it down and mark it as a duplicate, linking to a discussion about a problem solved in some other language using some library or language feature that doesn't even exist in the language you CLEARLY identified in your original question. Or you'd be swamped by people mocking you because you missed an obscure bit of documentation that detailed your problem on some random Github fork of one of the packages you're using. Using the site became a frustration-filled political minefield where you had to play their game or risk getting booted. \n\nMy all time favorite was a question where I asked about implementing a package in a specific way, and got back a dozen different responses from people telling me that I shouldn't do it that way and that I should do it \"this other way\" instead. Thing is...I needed to do it the way I asked. That was why I asked. When someone finally wandered in and answered the question I'd actually asked, I marked it as the answer and then watched as other posters downvoted their answer into oblivion.\n\nIt was useful, but it was ALWAYS a pain. High school level petty drama. More angry assholes than the Castro.\n\nAI gave us an alternative without the headaches.",

          "text": "Theres some goofy AI talk in this essay but at least they touch on what I think is the core issue:\n\n>**Gatekeeping made Stack Overflow worse. The platform developed a reputation for hostile moderators who would close questions as \"duplicate\" before the asker even had a chance to clarify.** \n\nThis was happening years before llms blew up. I used SO off and on for a while but dealing with such a hostile community gets exhausting. One of the best comments Ive seen about SO was that its a site setup to be an encyclopedia but with a question-and-answer format. The problem is these two things are contradictory to each other. Moderators wanted to keep a 'clean' site going, which is not always conducive to actually answering questions or welcoming new members. \n\nLike anyone else who used it I lost count of how many times I had a question marked as a duplicate even if the 'original' in question was 4 years old with a different tech stack.\n\nI could be wrong but I feel like the end is pure hopium:\n\n>Now, one way Stack Overflow can move forward is by becoming an LLM-assisted, chat-based platform where AI generates initial answers, but humans validate and approve them before they become part of the permanent knowledge base.\n\nWhy would people do this instead of just going with the answer provided by their chatbot? This is what we've already seen happening for a while. I sometimes use llms to point me in the right direction so I can do some deeper research, but that doesnt seem to be what the overall trends are showing. We've seen huge traffic drops for sites across the board like webmd, wikipedia, and recipe and travel sites. Maybe SO can rise again but I'm skeptical.\n\nI say that with some sadness but they did this to themselves.",

That reputation was a sort of street cred for aspiring bloggers and influencers.  As the platform grew, the reputation earned through answering questions would unlock additional ways to earn reputation (e.g. moderation, refinement, etc).\n\nThe core problem SO never addressed was that it was easier to earn reputation points if you already had them, and that there was a compounding interest associated with having answered fundamental questions.  This created an \"Old Reputation\" class.  At one point I was in the top 5% of contributors for my 16 year old answer to a question about the difference between SQL functions and stored procedures.  Someone who managed to answer multiple fundamental questions basically secured their spot in the upper echelon of \"Old Reputation\" users.\n\nUnfortunately there are only so many fundamental questions to be answered and the window of time for someone to join that exclusive club closed about 15 years ago.  Would-be influencers found that the only way to earn reputation was by contributing to the community through moderation activities.  This included refining existing answers and thus earning some reputation off those fundamental questions by being a leech.  These folks became the \"New Reputation\" class.\n\nThe next major problem was one SO created by starting to work with recruiting and hiring platforms.  Suddenly those fake reputation points had value and users were incentivized to secure them in order to juice their resumes.  The \"New Reputation\" class had a problem though, anyone with enough reputation could perform rep earning activities and challenge their position.  The result was the evolution of the toxic community practices to basically punch down at anyone trying to participate in the platform in any way other than up-voting.\n\nThe last time I logged into SO was many years ago, and at the time my question was still earning me rep, I was in the top 10%, but my clear 2 sentence answer no longer existed.  It had been rewritten dozens of times over by other mods \"refining\" and expanding upon it.\n\n\\* Logged into SO and revised above year numbers accordingly.",

If a question asks \"How do I do X without breaking library Y compatibility\", it'd fit into the \"How do I do X\" archetype. Archetypes would appear as info panels with a sentence or two summary, as opposed to tags' less-prominent display. I'd insist on a cultural change to prefer putting almost-duplicates into an archetype rather than closing them, because not everyone is enough of an expert to distinguish when subtle nuances completely change the correct answer. A question may belong to multiple archetypes, and archetypes could themselves have archetypes, forming an acyclic directed graph.\n\nTrue duplicates, with a *far* stricter threshold to count as duplicate, could either be marked as such, filtered-by-default in the archetype view and hidden from site search and search engines alike, or moved into a practice sandbox: An area of the site mainly intended for new users to try writing their first few answers, with hard caps on the amount of points that may be earned by each type of participation. Except comments; in the sandbox, comments would be intended primarily for feedback on the writing of a question/answer, so encouraging experienced users to stick around where they can mentor newcomers is obviously worthwhile.\n\nAs time marches on, old tools and versions become obsolete and new solutions emerge, questions might get marked as outdated. Kept as historic context, as the wisdom of the past might still be of use later, it would change how eye-catching the archetype panels are displayed, heavily encouraging the reader to browse for a more up-to-date version.\n\nLastly, opinion questions would be silo'd off into their own tree of archetypes and filtered out of searches by default, rather than outright disallowed.

Later it dropped, and I can see why the rise of LLMs was a geminate cause, but it was already dropping - you could also argue that it started dropping at the point they were acquired (which happens to be close in time to the launch of ChatGPT, but is less clearly a cause). If I were to speculate, I'd say that it had a \"community vibe\" or whatever early on, which got drowned in the over-moderation nonsense etc, and it was just waiting for something else to come along and disrupt it.

          "text": "Saw the link goes to what looks like an AI company, so that gave me a bit of pause because...well, duh. Didn't read it, but betting it's something with AI is better?\n\nIn my opinion, SO was a demonstration that people are kinda' terrible. It is/was a source of knowledge pooled from a large number of experienced programmers who would share their knowledge but only if you adhered to a strict set of rules comprised of some reasonable rules and some seemingly arbitrary rules and you had to prove yourself worthy of their knowledge because they didn't HAVE to share their knowledge, and they'd let you know it, especially since there wasn't really a lot of people that got to know each other as actual humans. You were a faceless text requesting knowledge from people who may or may not want to answer you if they wanted more Internet points.\n\nYou have a project, you ran into a problem, you were looking for an answer. You weren't looking for a ritual following a sacred checklist from people who fancied themselves gurus, and if you strayed from the One True Path of Programming Enlightenment (which seemed to be very specific to the person holding The Answer) you were at best ridiculed/insulted while getting the answer to your problem, at worst lectured about \"actually your question is irrelevant and you are doing it all wrong\" and once finished left questioning if you were too stupid to be a programmer.\n\nThere were some truly helpful people on the platform. There were some people who genuinely helped and in some ways would mentor. But there were too many who seemed to value asserting their superiority other programmers. Only the worthy should have a portion of their knowledge.\n\nSo along comes LLMs. Marketed as AI. It sounds almost human. It's trained from tons of existing sources, including SO, along with a ton of source code in GitHub and who knows what else. This thing remixes information then has filters in place where a company tells it that it must be a best friend to clients. It must let users know that they are worth of the trophy, there are no stupid questions, and act as if it is a mentor that is proud of you for not forgetting to put your pants on in the morning, let alone ask about the proper syntax of a loop in a specific dialect of BASIC. It never tells you you're doing something stupid, you're doing it wrong, asking the wrong question or neglected to look in a particular page of the MAN pages for an obvious answer. The LLM just patiently explains, sometimes even correctly, how to do what you're asking it to do. No judgement (or if there is something that feels like judgement, it's to tell you how great your question was and assure you that other people have the same problem so you're not alone!)\n\nI got my question answered. It probably works. If I use it \"right\" I remember to ask it the question in a way that addresses a potential security problem in implementation, or I can ask it to elaborate on the answer so I can understand the solution instead of copy and pasting (which was a complaint about SO users too, only now people assume the LLM makes it worse.) There was far less hassle, far less judgement, and it's pretty consistent compared to asking on SO where you look over at the SO digital hill and see the experts in their priestly robes standing atop the digital mountain wondering why no one wants to talk to them anymore and concluding it's because you, the lowly moron beginner, is too dim to follow their simple checklist of rituals to be worthy of their superior approach to implementing that loop (that they'll note should have been a SELECT{}, so you were doing it wrong, by the way.)\n\nWhy are developers moving away from SO...sounds like a question that only non-technical management would ask. Developers used SO and that answer is so obvious it would be deleted as a duplicate.",

Tried making a new account, but it’s practically fucking impossible.

There's almost no value in mocking API calls, in a real life you'll find that the actual API behaves just a little different, or changes over time, making your test look good for coverage purposes, and not much more. YMMV of course, but I usually create an interface, have the real integration and a fake integration. At least I don't have to deal with the obscure error messages mocking frameworks give, I am less tempted to mock every service call which will make it impossible to refactor anything later, and it usually allows me to write acceptance tests up front, should there be value in that.",

It's not OOP in the sense that many people think of OOP (e.g. Java or traditional C++ style) but it uses objects heavily and supports polymorphism via traits (but not implementation inheritance.)\n\nBut, the fact that it doesn't support implementation inheritance avoids a lot of problems that, though they are not inherent to implementation inheritance itself, tend to arise in practical applications of implementation inheritance in commercial development.",

          "text": "A long winded way to appeal to the \"right tool for the job\" idea. Problem is, it is very easy to take it too far, by either underplaying the suitability of a particular tool for many tasks, and overplaying the advantages of a particular tool for a given task. 20 years ago I used to think functional programming was _the_ future, I loved OCaml (still do), looked up to Haskell, and scorned C and C++ for being unneeded for most jobs.\n\nBut the more I code, the more I'm realising that even weak old unsafe C is way underrated.\n\n> Procedural programming tamed the chaos of spaghetti code.\n\nDon't forget about _structured_ programming though. Procedures are freaking amazing, but to make the `goto` spaghetti go away you also need the disciplined control flow that comes with `if` and `while`. And a cursory look at Wikipedia suggests the structured part came after the procedural part.\n\nAlso, \"procedural\" mostly means \"neither functional nor OO\" nowadays.\n\n> OOP arose when systems grew too large to fit in one head,\n\nFollowing you so far.\n\n> offering modularity and encapsulation.\n\nErr… I believe it wasn't the only one, nor even the first. Don't forget that modularity was also offered by… _modules_. And encapsulation needs nothing more than abstract data types.\n\nIn fact, the only two _new_ things OOP offered, were inheritance (now largely avoided, in part because it _breaks_ modularity), and subtype polymorphism, which was already possible with closures — which I reckon where mostly unheard of in existing imperative languages.\n\nOn the other hand, OOP _did_ popularised (not invented), an extremely powerful idea, that is now used all the time: _instantiation_. Before OOP was popular, complex data structures tended to be global. Take Lex and Yacc for instance, they assumed the program would have only _one_ lexer and _one_ parser, so they stored their internal state in global variables. But with OOP it became obvious to anyone how we might have several of them in the same program: just put their internal state in a class, then instantiate that class as many times as required.\n\nOf course such instantiation predated OOP as we know it to day by a couple decades. It was called \"plex\", \"record\", \"struct\", and \"class\", it was used before the Sketchpad demo. But it would seem it only became truly mainstream when OOP took over.\n\n> Functional programming emerged to handle concurrency, immutability, and data transformation at scale.\n\nThat sounds like a retcon, though I can't say for sure. As for handling concurrency (and parallelism), most of the time there's a much more mundane answer: just don't share mutable state across threads, and stop synchronising all the time.\n\nPurely functional data structures are amazing for stuff like \"undo\", though.\n\n> Younger developers often equate minimalism with superiority. “Keep it procedural,” they say. “Classes and abstractions are overkill.”\n\nFunnily enough, I did the reverse: I used to think abstractions (FP abstractions to be precise) were all the rage, and I'm now realising we can do almost as good with much, _much_ less.\n\n> Performance Isn’t the Only Risk\n\nCorrect. Though I'm not sure about seeing it as a risk. Performance is a _requirement_. We don't have infinite CPU time, _some_ threshold must be met. Sometimes the threshold is easily met with an accidentally quadratic Python script. Sometimes it requires a fast algorithm and SIMD or a GPU.\n\nThe following paragraph correctly touches on some performance myths, that though in some sense are true (immutable data structures do take more memory than mutable ones, virtual function calls or similar do have an extra indirection costs…), do not matter in many cases. They may be things to watch out for, but they're never hard and fast rules.\n\nOn the other hand, performance is not a niche concern. Noticeable startup times for instance, especially for popular programs, have more impact than we give them credit for: wasting a second per day per users quickly amounts to a _lot_ of seconds when you have millions of users.

I figured it'd be pretty dated, but it seems to have held up well and while I can't really recall examples to show, I remember thinking that the book was a fun read. Some classics are absolute slogs, but this one I suspect most of us will breeze through.",

That's just not really the case anymore, someone going through documentation for me would be nice but not a fulltime job for them because it's not that much work (and you definitely wouldn't need several people), and the closest analogue to oldschool paperwork would be writing up PRs and resolving tickets which I'd rather just do myself anyway.\n\nI'm not the person you asked, I think a lot of the book holds true today without issue, and you can even draw some good applicable wisdom about this chapter too.

Programmers use a small shadow of the full concept/theory.\n\nSame with monads and I assume applicatives (which I am not familiar with from my basic knowledge of cat theory). Monads aren't even very important in cat theory, they're a weird side thing.\n\nIt's ended up causing decades of confusion and almost deliberate obtuseness, scaring people away from functional programming for no good reason.\n\nCall them mappable and flatmappable and be done with it.

We should be using Monoidal Functor (street name: Zippable?) instead.\n\n- Applicative: `F[A => B] => F[A] => F[B]`\n\n- Monoidal: `(F[A], F[B]) => F[(A, B)]`\n\nThey are equivalent: one can be derived from the other.\n\nApplicative poorly conveys intuition about what is it useful for. Personally, it took me time to realize that Applicative looks the way it looks only because Haskell (language which popularized the concept) uses currying:\n\n- Calling a regular function in Haskell/O'Caml/F#: `f a b c`\n\n- Calling a function in an Applicative:`f <$> a <*> b <*> c`\n\nHowever, if your language doesn't encourage currying everything, you will never use Applicative this way in practice.\n\nThe intuition for Monoidal though is clearer: kind of like inner product of 2 tables:\n\n    zip(Some(42), Some(\"foo\")) == Some((42, \"foo\"))\n    zip(Some(42), None       ) == None\n    zip(None    , Some(\"foo\")) == None\n\n\n> Monad: “I Have a Value, and a Function That Returns a Wrapped Value”\n>\n> Applicative: “I Have a Wrapped Function and a Wrapped Value”\n\nI don't think those descriptions are particularly good for pedagogical purposes.\n\nConsider:\n\n- Monoidal - \"I can compose 2 independent steps\"\n\n- Monad - \"I can compose 2 dependent steps: the second step can depend on the result of the first\"\n\nPeople familiar with `Promise` or `Future` have a chance to recognize the pattern.",

If you can have a raw integer with values containing meaning vs a class containing that integer, giving it more context but the compiler will ultimately just compile down to the raw integer. Then you should be “wrapping” that integer by default. The reasoning is because this empowers you to get errors at compile time rather than runtime.\n\nIf seeing it in action will help you to sort out the whys of wrapping.

              "text": "> The huge gapping hole is WHY you even need all those concepts\n\nThat's EXACTLY like me from 10 years ago and before, when I was still struggling with grasping all those concepts.\n\nThe \"box\" is just a tool. The goal is purity. You abandon side effects. All functions are pure. Types don't lie: type `Int -> Int` means exactly that. You get guarantee of no spooky action at a distance. Benefits include:\n\n- less errors (functions are deterministic and total)\n\n- better testability\n\n- easier to modularize (black box with guarantee of no moving parts inside)\n\n- easier to parallelize\n\n- easier to rubber-duck (assuming you cross the proficiency threshold)\n\n- composability of effects (advanced topic)\n\nBut with abandoning side effects you also lose something:\n\n1. Ability to interact with the Real World (a.k.a `IO`)\n\n2. Ability for function to have a side-channel: anything that the function does besides returning a value.\n\nWhy is it a problem? `IO` is obviously necessary for practical software. And side-channels can be convenient. For example, the infamous error handling in Go language is an example of removing the side-channel: exception handling. User is forced to achieve equivalent functionality with more labor.\n\nWe need something to make up for losing side-channel. The solution is \"functional effect\" (I made up that name now). It's characteristics:\n\n1. It is user-definable what constitutes the side-channel and how it behaves (all that's required is to obey monad laws).\n\n2. The side-channel is explicit: it's visible in the type of the function. The \"box\" _is_ the side-channel.\n\n3. You retain all the purity: you can eat the cake and have the cake (magic!).\n\nUser-definablity of the side channel allows us to express many abstractions. If your \"box\" is `f a` then:\n\n- The value `a` may not exist, due to short circuiting. Examples: `Option`, `Maybe`.\n\n- The value `a` may not exist, due to an exception. Example: `Either`, `Result`.\n\n- There can be multiple values of `a`  to explore. Example: `List`, `Logic`.\n\n- The value `a` has an annotation `s`. Examples: `State`, `Writer`.\n\n- The value `a` does not exist yet, because it requires a dependency `r`. Examples: `Reader`, `useContext` from React.\n\n- The value `a` does not exist yet, because its computation is suspended (`() => a`). Examples: `IO`, `Future`\n\nIn each of those cases, you can use the \"box\" `f a` as if you were on the \"happy path\": you get access to single `a` by using `map` or `flatMap`/`then`.",

It seems rather aggressive and trying to be right.\n\nIn my experience, people do not decompose enough, so it makes sense to highlight the importance of keeping functions small, because this is what most programmers struggle with.\n\nSame thing with comments. Most programmers have a tendency to write redundant or crappy comments and let's not even mention AI stupid comments (which is probably due to having a lot of badly commented code in the learning data). Uncle Bob makes some good points in the book. Comments tend to be overlooked when changing code, which might result in them being obsolete or, even worse, wrong or misleading. I have seen this first hand so I tend to agree with Uncle Bob. I use docstrings, function names and commit messages to document my code and I think it is the superior approach vs inline comments.\n\nI have read John's book as well and I found it really interesting and I liked the concepts of complexity and deep/shallow functions, but I like Clean Code as well and I try to apply principles from both books.",

          "text": "When I read Uncle Bob's stuff, a lot of times I get the gist of what he's saying, but I don't like the way he says it.\n\nI agree with UB on method length (when used as a heuristic), although I would say it should decomposition by levels of abstraction. This was literally how I learned how to program, long ago, as procedural decomposition. Like literally, write an outline of the code first, and then write a function for each level of the outline. I originally learned it in Basic and Pascal in middle school and high school, but when I saw it done in Scheme (Lisp) in college, I was blown away. So, I don't really understand why UB's position is controversial, except of course, in the dogmatic way he puts it \n\n> \"The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that.\"\n\nAnd of course, the absolutely horrific example of the prime number generator. Like, why would you even put that in print? Does UB not have friends that can tell him his code sucks? The [SICP book](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html#%_sec_1.2) has much better examples of how wonderfully procedural decomposition can be done in Scheme (Lisp).\n\nAlso, Uncle Bob's chapter in Clean Code on commenting is actually really good, with lots of good examples of what makes good comments. Again, Uncle Bob's terrible way of putting things, \"comments are an apology for unclear code\" buries the lede. I don't know if this \"zinger\" style of communication resonates with anyone, but I think it is terribly distracting, communicates a different idea than the idea it's supposed to represent, and frankly makes UB sound like a moron.\n\nAnd finally on TDD. I get the idea that Uncle Bob is trying to convey, which John doesn't seem to be getting. Unit tests are an *executable* form of documentation that allows a way to detect deviation from the specification if changes to the code, either through refactoring or new features. Comments can't do that. \n\nThe point of doing it the TDD, and the value I find from the practice, is that it uses tests to drive development based on one feature (aka, test case) at a time. The problem I see when people write unit tests after, especially when coverage metrics are involved, is that the test cases often don't align to any specification, but is a random mess of test methods to satisfy the metric. When I see some of these kinds of unit tests in PRs, I ask, what is the point of this test? When the answer is, I needed to cover this code path, I die a little inside. Like yeah, but what is that code path supposed to be doing? Why is that code path important?\n\nJohn seems to be hung up on design, but that's not what TDD is about by itself. TDD focuses more on \"does this code do what it is supposed to do\" (and the test methods are named accordingly). Design is not mutually exclusive with TDD, but complementary. But, with any practice, it is possible to miss the forest for the trees.\n\nWhat I find interesting is that if you take John's \"bundling approach\":\n\n    design -> code -> unit test\n\nIn those terms, TDD is actually more like:\n\n    design -> unit test -> code\n\nWith the design being a rough sketch or a spike (one to throw way). This is how I at least understood the process from Uncle Bob's book [Agile PPP](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Principles-Patterns-Practices-C/dp/0131857258). In the Payroll case study, the first chapter goes through the requirements, coming up with a list of use cases and features and sketching out some UML to get a feel for the design of the system. Then the tests are written, one feature at a time.\n\nAnother point of TDD, which I don't know if UB captured in the interview, is that your design must be falsifiable. As you write the tests, you might find that the initial design doesn't make sense. This was the point behind the bowling game example. By doing TDD, you can figure this out faster, throw out code, and the whole effort won't be wasted because the tests are still valid, and you have at least a partial specification to iterate new designs against.\n\nI don't want to sound like an Uncle Bob apologist, because a lot of things he says is crap, but I agree with the gist of what UB is saying in thi sinterview, and I don't think John's objections are giving UB's ideas a fair shake, which may also be a consequence of UB's not so great communication style.",

In a world full of screaming about nonsense with zero facts, at least this conversation isn’t screaming.  Also, clear and well written.\n\nStill, it points out the utter lack of actual science and measurement around how *process* interacts with results. And even what are *good results* in some sense. Although at the end of the day everyone agrees: design matters, performance matters, and having tests to support porting, upgrading, and refactoring matters. Under debate, do comments matter. Under debate, is function size to the detriment to understanding and testing.\n\nMy personal take after 40 years in the business is: \n\n1) never liked TDD (aka test first development) and still don’t. +1 John. Unfortunately, since we’re unable to reason or prove code at scale, we continue to need unit tests. Unit tests comprise the majority of written code. If you’re building a library it’s a basic requirement. The time order is irrelevant in the end. Practically you just need them. And in reality as software evolves the tests will necessarily change. I’ll also mention that most of this perspective assumes a 1990 view of the world - where networks and micro services aren’t a thing. For lots of code, that’s the test that matters and difficult to do as a *unit test*. \n\n2) comments. Lots of bad nonsense here. “This is the constructor”. No, that disrespects your teammates, and wastes time and energy. Instead, preconditions: none…etc. Interesting algorithm? Please explain. How concurrency works if applicable, please explain. +1 John.\n\n3) function size. If it fits on a 1985 amber screen laptop (aka 40 sloc x 80 wide), you’re likely good. Sure, you could run a McCabe metric on it, but it’s likely extremely readable in that form. No science, just observation. Smaller is clearly more testable and readable. +1 Bob.",

Normally extracting some logic into a well named method helps with reading the code, because you don't need to jump into that method. That's not the case for UB - his extracted methods off-handedly mutate global state and depend on preconditions that are not obvious at all. He even acknowledge that in the interview, claiming that not only you need to read the whole code, but you need to do that in the right order...\n+1 for Bob on \"more testable\"? Have a look at https://github.com/johnousterhout/aposd-vs-clean-code?tab=readme-ov-file#bobs-rewrite-of-primegenerator2 with the classic ultra testable approach \"why pass arguments when you can use global vars\" and \"why return values even you can mutate some global state\"",

                  "text": "I didn’t read the code terribly carefully. I was reacting mostly to the philosophy discussion. Because this particular sample isn’t actually deep enough to require much upfront design (or is it, see below) it’s difficult to judge. Still, if this is added to a standard library the constraints might be different than if buried as an implementation detail in a crypto generator.\n\nAfter looking at it a bit I’ll keep my position. John writes the whole thing in a single function - and Bobs right about that continue (I got downvoted already here for say continue == goto, but I’ll stick to my guns - it’s goto and we don’t allow it in our codebase). Take the word *static* off and it’s not global, just protected data in a class instance I think (sorry, my Java is pretty rusty and I’m already upset that I have to write a class to write a function, but I digress). There’s likely some performance penalty to passing the result around. What it points out immediately is there’s a resource consideration to handle — and that impacts the resulting api. It’s very much a design/context question where that data belongs. And despite what I said about TDD, I would want to write tests for the candidate selector.  It’s *all opinion though because we don’t have meaningful studies* (someone please correct me if that’s wrong). \n\nPersonally, I’d be tempted to write it as a coroutine (in c++) as a generator function so the state is encapsulated and the client simply gets the next value for as long as they need. Don’t need to decide up front the value of n.  If I did that, I’d write the core as functions in case I needed to use the code outside a coroutine (and really I’d be using std::generator to turn it into a range so I didn’t need to write coroutine logic). \n\nIf we actually know ‘n’ at compile time I’d be inclined to generate the entire solution at compile time (again c++ with constexpr/consteval). At that point, the performance and test is moved to the compile step and the client code is as fast as the OS can load the program.  Up to a certain size of n this might be a great solution for embedded because no runtime allocation. The constraint on the size of n would be device memory. \n\ntldr: all we have as a discipline are *opinions about best practices* after 70ish years.",

It's crap, but it's not maliciously-crafted to do the most damage. Though if they've got filters in place to discard that sort of thing, you'd need to do careful research to figure out the best malicious data that *doesn't* get rejected, and it might take more copies to have a significant effect.",

You know how if you keep clicking the first link on a Wikipedia page, supposedly you eventually get to Philosophy regardless of where you started? What if you chose the content that gradually aligned the model state towards a specific end goal. Say, gradually-shift topics until a rick roll over the course of a few paragraphs, creating a model-wide funnel of nudged probabilities. Or, *always* pick the most likely word, especially when that creates a loop of output repeating endlessly. Better yet, find when the second- or third-most-likely word doesn't break the loop, creating what I can only think to call a rope of a cyclic graph cluster, where even the usual randomness they inject can't break the model out.\n\nSomeone with a proper understanding of how the models work under the hood, rather than my mere gathered-in-passing understanding, and who has a local model of their own that they can fully inspect the state of after each token, could probably make some truly-malicious poison!",

                  "text": "Yeah, maybe, but there is reason to hope that it will be different this time;\n\n\"Big tech\" has always been different form other industries for 2 reasons: 1) they are asset-light companies that make a lot of money regardless and 2) they always had a growth-story to ride on.\n\nNumber 2. ended somewhere around 2012. The smartphone was the last true big reveal of big tech, the last thing where most people in the world really went \"wow! this is amazing!\".\n\nEver since then, these companies have been **desperate** to find a new super-grower. So, instead of actually having *innovation* and products that naturally generated growth stories, they started making growth stories themselves their product. That's why we went through all the shit: Big Data, IoT, wearables, Crypto, NFTs, VR/AR, Spatial Computing...and now AI. None of these were big, tremendous innovations, they were hyped up stories.\n\nGo back in time and look about how people talked about \"Big Data\". How it would \"change everything\" or \"revolutionize industries\". **They used the exact same vocabulary they now use for promoting AI, almost verbatim!**\n\nSure, there was, and is, *some* money in all of these hype-cycles (some people did buy some VR headsets I guess, and some IoT devices are kinda-sorta useful). But the actual *value* generated was nowhere near the hyped up promises. But that's okay from the PoV of the people in charge of the shitshow. They don't care about actual products, they only care about \"number-go-up\" on the stock market...and as long as there was a shiny new thingy to dangle before ever more gullible investors, stock got bought and number went up.\n\nThe fact that money was essentially free after governments bailed out the banks in 2008 exacerbated this. And that's how companies  that haven't really innovated anything of note, actively burned billions on crap, and enshittified everything they touched for the better part of 1.5 decades, got more valuable than ever before.\n\n----\n\nSo, they needed a new growth-story. And along came generative AI. And someone had the super-duper-verystablegenius-bigbrain idea, of betting on a growth story, that required trillions in datacenter buildouts and GPUs, ate tons of power, and had piss poor unit-cost scaling.\n\n**And thus, advantage number 1 went out the window as well.** Because with this AI craze, big tech turned themselves into *asset-heavy* companies. All the problems of traditional industry, with none of the experience in how to deal with them; including the golden rule of any industry that requires heavy assets to serve its customers: **Build for the Market.**\n\nNo one in their right mind would build a car factory for 5 billion, or a nuclear power plant for 10bn, if they weren't 100% sure that there is demand for it. Big Tech however, thought that all their uniqueness still applied, and would always apply, and started splooging out hundreds of billions in borrowed money...for a product which we now know barely has any real market.\n\nAnd they also cannot just pull out of this one. When you're asset-light, and a hype cycle slows down, you can just pivot to the next shiny thing, no hurt feelings. But datacenters are real buildings, on real land, that require real hardware, and real power. So when someone builds all that on borrowed money, and the bet doesn't pay off, things get interesting. And due to the nature of these particular datacenters, they also cannot just be used for something else...1) because the hardware is very specific, 2) *there is no market for it*. Sure, GPUs are useful for some other things...but not on that scale! Who needs 8GW in new compute for physics departments, protein folding and weather forecast?\n\nWhat big tech will end up with here, is a massive oversupply of *pyhsical assets*, built on debt, which they cannot sell to anyone, and which loses them tons of money every hour it exists.\n\nAnd remember: Those companies are valueable because investors buy their stock, because they trust them to grow eternally. So what do you think will happen when investors realize what I just described? Exactly. It's going to be a shitshow.\n\n---\n\nAnd btw. the game is also different this time for the smaller players in this hype cycle. In the past, for all these hyped up things, startups absorbed VC money until they got acquired by someone. Problem is: **Almost no one is acquiring AI startups.** And why would they? Most of these smaller companies are essentially just a wrapper around some prompts around some model offered by the big players. They have no moat. They are not unique. Anyone who wants to can just instantly replicate them. Why would anyone buy these companies, when they can just wrote a similar prompt and get the same thing?\n\n\n\n----\n\nSo in summary, AI will likely be the straw that breaks the camels back, because it's not just another hype cycle...it's the hype cycle that the tech industry burned every advantage they previously had, to somehow make it happen.\n\nThat's what makes me believe that this crash will be different. It will be bad for everyone, sure. But it will be a horror show for big tech. Whatever happens, I don't think that their current rot-economy MO will make it through that.\n\nAnd good riddance.",

          "text": "Thanks for writing a beginner friendly post. However, I think the example could teach some bad practices to a beginner, sending them down the wrong path. Here are my suggestions: \n\n* You've used quite a lot of packages for a small codebase. Given we're making one logical component, I would use one package for this. You might want to split it into a load balanced package and a main package, but more than that is unnecessary and inefficient. \n* Minor point: the slice management in the pool package isn't great, leading to unnecessary allocations. The constructor makes a slice of length zero, which is likely to be a wasted allocation (it likely allocates more than zero, but if it's less than the final length, it will be wasted). It seems simpler to take the full set of servers in the constructor, rather than looping over them in the main package. The lack of locking isn't ideal either. If you add a server at runtime, to increase your capacity, it could lead to a crash currently. \n* It's better to use a single HTTP client in all places, so you can benefit from things like connection pooling. Currently, you're creating different clients in each place, with different configuration. \n* There's no locking in the health checker, which is prone to various issues. It also seems to sleep its interval between each server, rather than each round. That is, a user might set an interval of 1 minute, expecting you to check each server every minute, but you will actually just check one server per minute.\n* The `BalancerStrategy` interface only supports context-free approaches like round robin, as it provides no inputs. A strategy like IP hash couldn't work with this interface, as the client IP isn't provided.\n* The round robin has an unused `sync.Once`.\n* You probably want to parse (and validate) the server URL when it's added to the pool, rather than on every request. This would give better error handling (a bad server would be rejected from the pool, rather than breaking 1 in every `n` requests received) and would be more efficient. \n* For actually proxying the request to the backend server, I would strongly recommend using something like [net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httputil@go1.25.5#ReverseProxy), rather than rolling it yourself. Proxying isn't as straightforward as it looks, and there are some subtle security risks. In particular, you're currently reading the full response into memory, which will break your load balancer if you start getting lots of big responses. Again, you're using a new HTTP client, except you're using a new client for every request, which is particularly wasteful.\n\nAgain, thank you for trying to help beginners, but I think it's important that beginners start with best practices, rather than getting into bad habits.",

This ensures that the core functionality could be imported elsewhere and it's documented automatically. The main package just has the opinionated invocation logic.\n* The [Backend](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/SlyMarbo/bulb#Backend) and [Pool](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/SlyMarbo/bulb#Pool) both use mutexes to guard access.\n* The health checker uses a configurable HTTP client, managed centrally in the health check config.\n* All the preparation and validation is done ahead of time, so that as little work is done when processing requests as possible.\n* The package has fairly extensive tests and there are benchmarks for each strategy.\n\n[github.com/SlyMarbo/bulb](https://github.com/SlyMarbo/bulb) ([docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/SlyMarbo/bulb))",
