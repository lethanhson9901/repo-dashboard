(That is, it is more work to write than to read!) ...  \n\n> If, however, prose is LLM-generated, this social contract becomes ripped up: a reader cannot assume that the writer understands their ideas because they might not so much have read the product of the LLM that they tasked to write it.\n\nThe breaking of a social contract is a very accurate way of describing this, in my opinion. LLM usage can go beyond typical rudeness, they create situations with *epic* levels of time wasted by professionals in similar positions to the curl team.\n\n[0] https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0576",

Often by reading existing code, just for the act of reading it, you can find bugs or improvements. Obviously it is a hard sell to tell your boss \"hey we should just read our code\". Refactoring or a rewrite of code is continuation of that reading and understanding, can't refactor what you don't know.\n\n\nHowever, I do find that often re-writes create new bugs because it can very easily mis recreating behavior that was originally a mistake but now other code depends on that incorrect behavior. ",

It's not that I don't care, it's that I only go down the new queue a few times a day. I do remove the things you're talking about, but generally I'm seeing them after they've been up for a few hours. I was traveling over the holidays and pretty busy this weekend and more stuff stayed up than usual, sorry about that.\n\nThe biggest category of posts that I remove is demos (\"I made this\"). After that it's random AI related things that have nothing to do with programming, and after that it's support/forum questions. (That last one may surprise you but if you saw the quality of them you'd understand.) [I wrote more about this here](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chs4ib/the_state_of_the_subreddit_may_2024/) but as you can see it's been some time.\n\nI've really love to get some more mods, but I'm very concerned about finding people that I can trust. Some of the more active users here (which is what reddit's find-a-mod feature uses) are really inappropriate to become mods. I'm not sure what other criteria that I can find to keep it from becoming a drama fest.\n\nI'm not happy with the current situation either, but I'm not sure how to make it better. I'm doing my best. Mods aren't paid by reddit so you're shouting \"I sure wish somebody else would do more free work for my pleasure!\". And honestly I'm with you, I wish there were an easier way to deal with this. But until there is, I'll keep doing my best.",

I don't know how to really 100% smell which of the two is happening with enough consistency that it can be a rule that the mods enforce here.\n\nTBH, I think I'm fine with people here pushing back on their own and mods sticking with the more procedural aspects of modding instead of a content-driven approach.",

Here is the rant:\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nAs you may notice, this page and pretty much the entire website were obviously created with the help of AI. I wonder how you could tell? Was it a big \"Written With Claude\" badge on every page? I moved it to the top now (with the help of AI of course) to make it even more obvious. There are a few blogposts that were written by me manually, the old-fashioned way, I hope there will be more in the future, and those have a similar \"Human Written\" badge. This project (not the website), on the other hand, is a very, very different story. It took me more than two years of painstaking and unpaid work in my own free time. A story that, hopefully, I will tell someday. But meanwhile, what would you like me to do? To create a complex documentation website with a bunch of highly technical articles with the help of AI and fake it, to give you an illusion that I also did that manually? Like the half of itnernet is doing at this point? How does that makes any sense? Is that even fair to you? Or maybe to create this website manually, the old-fashioned way, just for you? While working a paid job for a salary, most of you wouldn't even get up in the morning. Would you like me to sing you a song while we're at it? For your personal entertainment? Seriously, get a grip. Do you find this information less valuable because of the way this website was created? I give my best to fix it to keep the information as accurate as possible, and I think it is very accurate at this point. If you find some mistakes, inaccurancies or problems, there is a comment section at the bottom of every page, which I also made with the help of the AI. And I woould very much appreciate if you leave your feedback there. Look, I'm just a guy who likes SQL, that's all. If you don't approve of how this website was constructed and the use of AI tools, I suggest closing this page and never wever coming back. And good riddance. And I would ban your access if I could know how. Thank you for your attention to this matter.",

For instance, a controversial or volatile project with a well defined estimate may shield the team from undue pressure or negative performance review in the event the project falters. \n\nI would also add that it’s better to *forecast* than it would be to use the verb “estimate”. Estimating the cost of materials is quantitative and generally fixed but its much harder to estimate service/labor costs. You don’t know what you don’t know, and you often uncover new information in software work that impacts the costs. In software development, this is more analogous to weather forecasting. We can forecast the costs of this software project based on current conditions, but that forecast is always subject to change as new information emerges.",

Bingo bongo you can figure out roughly when an epic will be done.\n\nAnd this plan often falls apart because stories have this horrible habit of spawning 3-4 more stories you didn't know you had to do when you started. Because software work is research and discovery.\n\nI really like the author's quote \"X Y Z would need to all go right, and at least one of those things is bound to take a lot more work than we expect.\" That's to say — unless you educate your PMs, you risk having these silly moments when they remind you that you said you'd be done in two stories five stories ago.\n\nI still like making stories. They help me focus and reveal ways the team might parallelize. They're illustrative and walkable by PMs and engineers alike — but you need to point out which ones (as the author puts it) are the dark forests.",

                  "text": "I never said don’t estimate at all, but instead to call it “forecasting”. It is a better name for it. \n\nBut to answer your question, forecasting gets better the longer you do it and have a history of completed work. New teams and new projects mean you need to start over. Over time, you get a sense of complexity, scope, capacity,  velocity, and team dynamics. \n\nSo on a new team/project, we would start by *guessing*. What feels right, right now? Listen to your gut. \n\nThen after a sprint, retro. What worked, what didn’t, what could we improve? Inspect and adapt. \n\nThe next time you forecast, more becomes clear. \n\n> “We thought that task was going to be hard, but it was easy. Now that that task is done, this is clearly a 1 pointer.” \n\nAlso, if using points and just starting out, I like to ask my team “we need a signal that something is too complex and needs to be broken down further. Let’s figure out how many points a complex task that might take an entire sprint might be.” If using modified fibbonacci with a point system like 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 100, for instance, I find most of my teams will say “I can definitely get an 8 pointer done before the end of sprint, but a 12 is likely too large” for instance. Now if we ever point a task as a 12 or higher, we know its at-risk of carrying over and is likely too complex, this is a signal that we either don’t know enough to solve it yet, or we need to break it down into smaller pieces to maintain consistent delivery.\n\nNext retro:\n> “We thought that task was going to be easy, but it was so hard we couldn’t even get it done in a sprint! That task was probably not a 5, but more like a 12 or 20!!”\n\nAfter a few of these cycles, you suddenly understand so much more about your team and the project. You now know that if you forecast anything larger than a 8, it’s probably not ready. You know now that your team of four engineers has completed on average 30 points of work per sprint, that is your velocity. That is also close to 4 engineers x 8 pts per sprint = 32 points of forecasted velocity, which validates your forecasting. You now know that you can expect a capacity of about 30 pts per sprint. You now likely know more about your project, too. You now can start measuring reliability. \n\nThat’s how I do it in a mature, medium to large organization. I have been working with smaller VC startups lately and for those teams I don’t forecast at all. YAGNI. Don’t add planning and overhead you don’t need, until you need it. \n\nMore tips: experiment. Play around. Every team and project is different, take the opportunity to experiment. Observe. Reflect. Keep what works. Drop what doesn’t. For forecasting Ive used points but also t-shirt sizes instead sometimes. It’s all tools in the toolbox, and you should pick the tools for the job.",

You should always propose the *ideal* system, first, and help your manager understand why building it that way is justified.  Otherwise, you’re leaving your manager high and dry when they actually need to push back on unrealistic demands from above.\n\nTrust isn't just about being easy to work with. OP mentions building a \"well of trust\" by being pragmatic. But real trust is when your manager knows you won't let them accidentally ship a disaster just to hit a deadline.\n\nIf we just hold our finger to the wind to see which way the wind is blowing before we even look at the code, we're not leading— we're just being order-takers with better titles.

This is one of the not-so-obvious failures by technical folks -- not being transparent about what costs they are signing up for. Or worse, the developer says they are implementing a quick and dirty solution, but hand-wave away the costs by saying it should be easy to fix later. But they don't go into detail about what that cost will be later, when later needs to be, and who the dependencies are for later. And that's ignoring the fact that they are not constantly rebasing the expected cost of later with coming changes that the developer might not be able to foresee. That's one of the things managers actually do for us -- they are constantly rebasing the expected cost with the actual cost. So, more info given to them allows them to do that better.",

In particular, the engineering team management decided it wasn't important to challenge the team to make hard decisions around scope. \n\nJust like with any kind of forecasting you need enough sample points (smaller tasks, more team members) and robust sampling (not having each team member work only 1 type of task).\n\nThis article is ridiculously naive and circle jerky. It completely ignores basically the whole point of it, which is to give your team the ability to plan, roadmap, and make informed trade offs.

I think in an experienced team, it's often possible to have useful accuracy.\n\n\nAs an example, at my last job we had a bunch of services based on a framework. We stood up a new service a couple of times a year, and we very often added a new feature to an existing service that required the same pattern of work: add a new DB column, add some business logic around it, add some new methods to the API. Even if the exact business feature was quite different each time, the time to completion was straightforward to estimate.\n\n\nAnd estimates are really important. They allow sales and marketing to do their jobs. They also give important leverage to the engineering team (\"we said it would take three months, and it'll take three months. Stop pressuring us to get it done in two, it's not happening.\")\n\n\nAs for the engineering team, the process of estimating is important because it quickly reveals the degree of certainty attached to all the key elements. When you are being asked to commit to a date, that's often the point where you really pore through the requirements and realize: hey, there's something here that I don't even know how to do yet. We often have a tendency to rush in and begin with the easy parts, the fun parts, the flashy parts, and ignore the fuzzy, ugly, poorly understood parts. Where I work, project estimation is often the first place one is empowered to tell management that the requirements are unclear and must be fixed. THAT happens all the time where I currently work.",

The hidden costs need to be made more explicit, maybe even as jokes: \"when this will be done?\", \"tell me first how much you'll pay for maintaining all our for-cycles in the code\". Separate the estimates and reports: when something will be done and when the information about the progress will be available, and make the reports meaningful. To do this use the experience: how does the report and estimate of copying files look like? Nothing, theoretical calculation, hanging on 99% for an hour, saying which files are already copied, specify the number of copied files regardless of their size, specify the size regardless of number of files, say the copy is complete, but it's actually in the cache and might be lost if the device disconnects - plenty of options to consider. The binary-search-like approach and experience actually helps: specify two points \"I'll complete it in 5 minutes\" and \"I'll complete it in 5 years\", both are not realistic, cut the range in half, see which half is more likely contains the realistic estimate, repeat. Negotiation is not forbidden in the estimates: \"we need to complete A in order to retain the customer, their renewal decision is in one month\", \"what if we give them B in two weeks, but A in two months?\". \n\nSir, this is Wendy's.",

Things get rough when there is 0 specification apart from 4 sentences from a client and they refuse to pay for discovery and you are competing against 5 other companies trying to get the project.

Surprise, surprise, once I got the task of overlooking estimates and I managed to point out how most of our devs are overestimating by a large margin, we could actually get projects because I'd correct the estimations. I was curious and got permission to not tell the same devs that the actual budget is much smaller yet they managed to finish work 70% of the time within my estimation.\n\nMost of our devs overestimated for 2 reasons: cookie points from the CEO and to slack off at home when calling in sick and \"work\" from home or being remote.\n\nI love remote and I fought multiple times to keep that offer on the table for anyone at the company, but boy, I fucking hate people who will estimate 40 hours for a simple fucking CRUD only so they can finish it in 4 hours or less with AI, then they can jerk off while we are pricing ourselves out of the market.\n\nEDIT: I'd add that what I described is not for corporate jobs or startups with self developed apps.

              "text": "Yeah, it wouldn't be terribly hard to build a UDP protocol using OpenSSL with a fast symmetric cipher and a key exchange handshake. If you want to prevent randos from reading your stream that'd probably be fine. Fundamentally you can never really trust the client platform, though. Spending your time trying to build trust into a fundamentally untrustworthy platform will buy you less for your engineering effort than mitigating the possible advantages a user could derive from intercepting that stream.\n\n\nYou can generally assume that given a strong enough financial incentive, people are going to figure out a way to cheat at your game. This isn't just true of video gaming. Casinos are in a never ending arms race and need to mitigate the effects of and detect possible collusion with their staff. See also [Postlegate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stones_Gambling_Hall_cheating_scandal). That one's wild.\n\n\n So your engineering effort is usually better spent mitigating the possible advantages that having access to the streams would confer on the user. Ultima Online had that problem with the introduction of sneaking decades ago -- people would detect you from across the screen and attack you even when you were hidden. They ended up not transmitting hidden players to clients until the server decided the hidden player had been detected. The cheaters could still have faster than human reaction times, but those advantages were not hugely game breaking.\n\n\nIn online poker, even given the best anti-cheat technology in the world someone could still point a camera at a laptop and do image recognition on card faces. So if you want to build a farm of colluding bots, it's not that difficult. An online casino could try to mitigate that by randomizing who you get placed with on a table if they have a big enough pool of players. But if you have a couple dozen (say) systems running bots, you just need to have a couple of them figure out they're sitting at the same table to give yourself an advantage. And that advantage will grow the more bots you have at one table.\n\n\nA few days ago, people were talking about marking their monitor with a sharpie to give themselves an advantage at some FPS or other. Which is why I tend to be suspicious of Esports as a thing unless they're played in a controlled environment with a standardized hardware/software loadout. I suspect part of Blizzard's policy on WoW plug-ins is at least partially an attempt to normalize the environment so that in such a controlled environment a player wouldn't be facing a completely unfamiliar interface. Whenever watching any of the wow streamer channels, their UI looked *nothing* like the stock one Blizzard provided.\n\n\nKnowing all of *that* and being able to convey that information when a user asks about something vaguely related to the ssh protocol being unsuitable as a gaming protocol really highlights the weaknesses in the current round of AIs. At this point the AI has been trained in all of human knowledge, but is incapable of identifying this question as being in the category of \"cheating protection\" and suggesting good places to spend your engineering time to mitigate the impact of cheating. If you follow its advice without thinking about the problem yourself, you might end up building a program that superficially looks pretty secure but doesn't stand up to a thorough analysis by people who have an incentive to do that work. I think the way the world's going now, there will be many opportunities from cheaters because an AI didn't consider lessons learned from the past in its suggested solution.

An AI (likely) has no idea what specific SSH daemon package you have on your local machine, what operating system you're running, or even whether or not you compiled your SSH daemon from source, omitting or including certain additional features. \n\nThey first explain that SSH added keystroke timing obfuscation in 2023. In [the link they posted](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20230829051257) which explains this functionality, it explains exactly how it is implemented and the new ping/pong extension that it uses. Therefore, if someone were to read that post and actually glean technical meaning from it, their next question would be: Is it possible to disable ping/pong SSH extensions on [my specific version of SSH?]\"\n\nIn their case, now knowing that they're using an SSH server implemented in Go, they could have even just searched the server's source code for the extension names (SSH2_MSG_PING, SSH2_MSG_PONG).\n\nBut instead, we can see the next figure in the blog post is the user immediately reverting back to their Claude prompt, asking  the extremely broad question of: \"Is there any way to disable the chaff server-side?\"\n\nI think the lack of explanation of what version of SSH the server running, lack of clarity that they specifically want to disable the new ping/pong extension, and the generic way they referred to the functionality as \"chaff\" demonstrated that despite AI and/or their research leading them directly to the answer, they failed to parse the technical information they were already provided and instead decided to rely on their AI agent to do the job for them and walk them through it.\n\nI was even more taken aback when I saw their screenshot mentioning \"Claude was also pretty pumped\" about their results, with the most obvious \"AI gassing you up and being your yes-man\" response of all time in the screenshot.\n\nI think the overall flow of their problem solving skills demonstrated in the blog post show an over reliance on AI and a lack of critical thinking skills applied to the project.",

By doing so, the author is denying themselves a valuable learning opportunity to try out and familiarize themselves with common networking and analysis tools (tcpdump, wireshark) that they'll likely use for the rest of their career.\n\n(Caveat: It's possible this is a personal skill issue on my part! I'm not denying that someone could write an insane tcpdump one liner to do network analysis - I just don't personally think someone with the skillset to do would ever choose to waste time on scripting that instead of just viewing raw dumped output/using wireshark - but that is also my bias.

I think it's somewhat silly to imply that Google has poor results when looking up technical documentation or information, as it's usually the shortest path to reach the writings of the actual implementers or designers of the thing you're investigating (ie: finding and reading sshd manpages, source code, etc. can all be done easily with Google, regardless of the search engine serving ads or whatever else)\n\nHaving an LLM parse similar manpages for me and try to regurgitate information from it, while obfuscating things like the sshd version, the source of the data, the legitimacy of the data source, etc. just feels like a waste of time. And if I ask an LLM to specify all of that information, I'm essentially just using a search engine again but with more steps.\n\nAI can be useful for providing guidance on generic problems, but it's important to stick to factual documentation and sources of information when dealing with complex technical issues or implementations like SSH. Documentation differs between versions, packages, operating systems, libraries, etc.\n\nAlso, on your point about Google being designed \"to make money for Google\":\n\nGoogle attempts to make a useful product, because if it isn't a useful search engine then users will stop using it. And if there are no users, there will be no one left to look at their ads. In the same way, Claude/ChatGPT/etc. currently attempt to be useful, but just like a Google search, are inherently profit-driven, selling user training data and other analytics.

We already *have* tools that produce that specification correct to the minute details: they're programming languages we choose to develop the product in.\n\n>We're trying to abstract those away by creating super fine grained natural language specifications so that any lay person could build things, and it doesn't work.\n\nI don't like this argument. Abstracting stuff to make our jobs easier can be really useful (or useless), \"it doesn't work\" is not a real reason considering your own example proved to be really useful, even if didn't manage to fulfill its original goal (and even that is debatable, considering it is definitely used by non-developers). A similar example of a succesful tool that tried to emulate plain english is Python.\n\nI believe a more productive approach to these kinds of abstractions is asking \"is it worth abstracting?\" and \"how?\". And here I reach a similar conclussion as you regarding LLMs",

Nope, and neither does anyone else.  If I write TypeScript code, and it passes all the tests I wrote for it, do I care what the resultant JavaScript looks like?  Nope, and neither does anyone else.\n\nWell, not until something goes wrong, of course, but I digress :)\n\nMaybe we should be thinking of AI more like a compiler, and our PROMPTS are the source code.  Of course, there's an obvious flaw there: a compiler will spit out the same code from the same source every time (barring version changes or anything like that).  That's definitely not true for an AI.\n\nBut I'm starting to wonder it that really matters?  As long as what I got THIS TIME works, does it matter what  I got LAST time?\n\nAnd what about the argument that AI-generated code is technical debt because eventually you're going to have to touch it yourself.\n\nARE you though?\n\nIf you need a new feature later, you just prompt (and prompt again and again and again and...) until you get what you want.  Oh, there's a bug?  Prompt the AI to fix it.  Oh, it's not quite performant enough?  Prompt the AI to optimize.  As long as the tests still pass, what's the difference?\n\nYour prompts are the source code, the AI is your compiler, whether it's a new feature, a bug, or anything else, why do you care what it actually produces if it works and passes the test?\n\nThis viewpoint bothers me a great deal because it may not be wrong.  Believe me, I've been coding in one form or another for right around 47 years now, professionally for a hair over 30.  And I still enjoy it.  So I don't WANT to NOT code.  But it could it be that \"coding\" is starting to have a different meaning?\n\nMaybe.\n\nAI tends to fall flat on its face if there isn't expertise guiding it.  I've seen people use AI poorly because they don't have the skill to even prompt it properly for what is needed.  You can only go so far with these tools without knowledge and experience to guide it properly.  But man, when you have those things, what you can get out of them IS pretty amazing sometimes... the trick is you have to not look under the covers... and maybe that's okay.\n\nLike I said, it's an evolving thought, and I may well discard it upon further reflection.  But it strikes me as an interesting thought regardless.",

Claude can tell me very convincingly that I'm on the right path, it can code a solution, it can make something that works, and at the same time it can be architecturally absolutely the wrong thing to do. I think the process described in this article - where you start off impressed, gradually build out a project, and end up in a total mess - is absolutely spot on.\n\nI could decide, like this guy, to not use AI at all, but there's no question I would be slower in certain tasks. But for every task I delegate to it, I'm not really learning (though again, I can't really be dogmatic here because I *do* learn stuff from Claude) and I don't really get to know the system that I'm creating. At work I'm writing in a C++ codebase; I hardly know C++, so AI has written a load of my code. Lo and behold, I shipped a catastrophic C++ bug to production last week (call me names, this is not just my reality; many engineers are doing the same thing). I would *love* for AI to not exist, because then I could really work to become an expert in C++, and it would be understood that this will take time. But because of AI, the assumption is I don't have to do this learning, because an agent can already write the code. So I feel pressured to use AI, even though using it is making me a worse engineer. \n\nIn a way, I think giving up on it entirely is both admirable and sensible. But I worry that if models improve, I'll just end up doing nothing more than raging against the (word-making) machine while others profit from it...",

          "text": "I’ve been working with SharePoint for quite a while and I noticed a few points that may not be fully accurate or at a minimum I had some thoughts about it, and I wanted to share some clarifications that might be useful for you and others in the community.\n\n>**SharePoint Framework is Still Painful**  \nWant to test a change? Package your web part, deploy it to your SharePoint tenant, refresh the page, and hope it worked. The local workbench barely functions for anything beyond trivial examples because it can’t properly mock SharePoint’s APIs. You end up deploying to a dev tenant constantly, and each deploy takes minutes.\n\nThis is not accurate. There is no need to deploy to the tenant every time you make a change. You can work directly in the page and it will automatically refresh as well, without a need of using the Workbench. You can work directly against the APIs.  \n[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/debug-modern-page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/debug-modern-page)\n\n>**The Object Model is Inconsistent**  \nModel), the JSOM (JavaScript Object Model), and the legacy SOAP services. They don’t have feature parity. Some operations are only available in REST, others only in CSOM. Documentation is scattered and often outdated. You spend half your time trying to figure out which API even supports what your trying to do.\n\nI tend to agree with the frustration here. Documentation is certainly hard to find and much of it is out of sync. The only comment I'd make is that you're sort of comparing Apples to Oranges in the blog post when you compare CSOM to REST. Under the covers CSOM is just calling into the APIs anyway, with the exception of server related things on-premises (which should be a given that it's different). The Object Model exists to abstract away some of the nuances of the underlying APIs, and it's expected that they may function differently.\n\n>**Page Rendering Is Slow**  \nThere’s no efficient bundling or lazy loading. Everything gets loaded upfront, whether you need it or not.  \n....  \nThe “modern” pages in SharePoint Online are supposed to be faster, but they’re still noticeably slower than a well-built static site or SPA. \n\nAgain, another area where I'd agree in some aspects,  but disagree in others. The pages are absolutely slow. SharePoint is a huge platform and it is built on decade old APIs that may not be very performant. However, it's a bit unfair to compare it to a static site. Obviously it would never be as fast a static site. In addition, there's context here that is important, which is the sheer amount of ACL's that need to be validated on any given page in SharePoint. It's a platform built on a complex web of hierarchical permissions and many different aspects of the page have to lookup to ACLs to determine whether a specific user has access to it. It's not just a simple web site.\n\nWith that said, I'd also argue about the efficient bundling and lazy loading. This is implemented in Modern SharePoint, both for different aspects of the page (e.g suite bar) and even within the page sections themselves.\n\n>**List Performance Degrades Quickly**  \nThe list view threshold is 5,000 items by default, and if your query exceeds that, SharePoint just refuses to run it. \n\nFor clarity, if your query *returns* more than 5,000 items then the call fails. You mention having a list with 8,000 items and then queries started timing out so you archived the data. Maybe you were in classic, but nowadays moving your data isn't necessary, you would just need to optimize the queries and using paging to return the data, if custom developed. If you're discussing the native experience, the modern experience handles this fine as long the indexes were created accordingly. I have a list with 1.3 million items in it, that I use for demoing this behavior when I speak at conferences.\n\n**Overall Thoughts**  \nFrankly, it was an interesting read and hope my post here doesn't come off as critical. SharePoint is beast of an application and your blog highlights a lot of the short comings of the platform, but at the same time explains the biggest issue with SharePoint. When SharePoint is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. At the end of the blog you summarized it nicely. You got a real application to build? Don't build it on SharePoint. Use Azure SQL, Blazor, etc. SharePoint can be a great platform to do what it's meant to do, the moment you start building large applications, transactional systems, heavily relational data, is when it truly starts to fall down.\n\nAt the end of the day you should use a product for what it's meant and not shove a square peg into a round hole. You hit the nail on the head when you said...\n\n>Stop trying to make SharePoint do everything.",

Personally, I do not see much value in pulling all of that information into your own database when SharePoint is already acting as that database for you. It also does not scale well, and with how quickly permissions and files change, the data is likely out of sync by the time you run a report. A report based on inaccurate data is not very useful.\n\nWhat kind of reports do you really need that go down the file level and permissions across an entire tenant in a view. Given the hierarchical nature of the permissions, and permissions down the files, you're talking about a really significant amount of data.\n\nI find that many reports that Businesses want is already available in Microsoft Purview, or available as part of the Microsoft Purview APIs. \n\nIf you truly need to operate at scale, the best option is Graph Data Connect, which is designed specifically for pulling data from Microsoft 365 and Graph in bulk. Otherwise, you're going to be constantly fighting against the throttling limits. Though if that's the route you're going to go, make sure you're using an App Registration, utilizing the Batch APIs to reduce the # of calls... not much else you can do.",

Fedora has 6-month release cycle so you won't be bothered by version upgrades too often and it's not shipping some day-old drivers with bugs in them, but it's still modern enough so that all the new hardware and whatnot works perfectly.\n\n[Ultramarine Linux](https://ultramarine-linux.org/) is another great option, it's new like Cachy but it's 99.9% Fedora so you're basically getting the stability and support from Fedora. What Ultramarine does better is that it comes with some important stuff pre-installed for you, such as NVIDIA drivers and proprietary media codecs.",

My final OMG moment was as I simply installed Steam and was ready to tinker with Proton/Wine but nothing. Just Steam-install my Windows games and play without hassle (not all run, but >90%). Even VR runs good. If they rtun they run better than under Win 11. Also AI, ComfyUI, Ollama all run so good. Adobe is the only I miss, will keep my Windows for longer as backup, but that's is it, a backup. ",

              "text": "I've been extensively studying and testing distros for the last few months, here's my current take (still just my opinion of course):\n\n* **Ubuntu** (and more so **Kubuntu**) is a solid distro in itself, but its parent company Canonical is basically the Microsoft of Linux. They have implemented some weird quirks into Ubuntu, most recently snaps (while the rest of the Linux world is committed to flatpak), and they are very much pushing their own agenda over the community's good. I just feel like once you switch away from Microsoft, why move to the next worst thing?\n* **PopOS** is a weird one. Their COSMIC desktop environment is theoretically crazy good and I can't wait to use it for real, but it's just not quite there yet. One or two more years and I will definitely try PopOS on my gaming rig, but for now I can't really recommend it due to it being in an awkward mixed state between old and new systems. Their dev team is fully focused on COSMIC, but it's not usable for most people yet.\n* **Fedora** is what I would recommend for most people's everyday use, specifically the [KDE Plasma](https://www.fedoraproject.org/kde/) version. Gaming, programming, creative work... basically for any desktop use. It's very much like Ubuntu for everyday use, but RedHat has been much more Linux friendly and user friendly than Canonical. Similar to Ubuntu, it has a 6-month release cycle for that sweet spot between stable and modern.\n* **Ultramarine Linux** is a promising new distro that's basically 99% Fedora but more beginner friendly. It has less post-installation hassle with things like media codecs and NVIDIA drivers pre-installed for you. Worth looking at, although I *personally* prefer sticking with the base distro (Fedora) whenever possible. But that's probably because I'm already familiar with it, if you're new to Linux then [Ultramarine](https://ultramarine-linux.org/) might be the best option there is right now.",

Haven't you followed the recent news regarding closing the code for RHEL? All distro based on it had to do some workarounds to resolve this, it hurt the open-source ecosystem a lot.\n\nAnd as much as I wanted to love Fedora, it is simply not as good as Ubuntu if you are on NVIDIA. The constant kernel and GPU driver updates requires the system to rebuild their versions against each other, leading to a lot of breakages. While on Ubuntu you rarely face this since the versions of things are just \"up to date enough\", rarely forcing rebuilds, and therefore, less breakages.\n\nUltimately I would recommend Fedora only for those who Are not using NVIDIA, unfortunately for me, it is not the case. Once I buy a new PC it'll be full AMD though, so I'll go back to Fedora and maybe abandon Ubuntu for good.",

I set up Headscale and RustDesk for easy remote support (I self-host on a $5/mo VPS that also hosts my personal website) and everyone has been super happy. I'm probably the happiest since if one person notices something is off, I can push out fixes to everyone using Ansible. Saves me a bunch of time.\n\nAs always with Linux, there's a little jank. Chrome didn't correctly associate its windows with the KDE tray icon, [so I helped convince the flatpak maintainers](https://github.com/flathub/com.google.Chrome/pull/483) to [merge a PR that would fix it](https://github.com/flathub/com.google.Chrome/pull/474). Similarly, Dropbox didn't detect the home directory correctly and required a manual workaround, [so I opened an issue and PR to get that fixed, too](https://github.com/flathub/com.dropbox.Client/issues/392). The beauty of open source on display.\n\nOf course there's all sorts of other jank I can't fix myself. Questionable interface decisions in KDE. Some AppStreams randomly don't work in Discover (e.g. Dolphin extensions, so no Dropbox sync indicators!). The software development story in containers is not as straightforward as one would hope and CUDA passthrough is still annoying.\n\nThe biggest headache, however, was installing the proprietary Nvidia drivers on my personal computer. There is no way to exaggerate how insane the process is. On a Secure Boot and/or LUKS-encrypted system, it's not enough to layer the akmod-nvidia and xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda packages, oh no. You must also generate a Machine Owner Key, enroll it, and then generate a small rpm package to shim that key into ostree. Then you have to manually configure dracut to load the drivers early enough for the LUKS prompt, which slows down updates by needing to renegerate the initrd. [Here's a guide I found invaluable](https://github.com/Comprehensive-Wall28/Nvidia-Fedora-Guide).\n\nIf you have a Nvidia GPU, I'd suggest looking at the more batteries-included Project Bluefin distros (Bazzite, Aurora, etc.). Take this with a grain of salt since I haven't tried them myself. For Intel or AMD, I'd recommend using vanilla Fedora for its stronger community and more storied history (i.e. I trust it more).\n\nAll that said, none of us miss Windows in the slightest.",

TL;DR: I really enjoy the workflow so far, especially the idea of keeping my toolchains separate from everything else via distrobox. Of course you don't *need* to be on Bazzite/Aurora/Bluefin to use distrobox, but it really fits the theme of the entire OS well.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't know if I'd just blindly recommend it to other devs. I'd say read up on the idea of atomic/immutable distros first, and if it sounds interesting enough then definitely give it a test drive on a separate drive or partition. I don't think it's too big of a change IMO, but you also can't just blindly `dnf install ruby` or whatever like you'd usually do, either.\n\nFor your regular Joe User that just needs the basics though? I can seriously see this being the future. Updates are dead simple and have almost no chance of completely trashing your system. And on the off chance that it *does* break something, rollbacks are a couple of clicks (or one command) away.",

That's just the first thing I do now if I run an update and my second monitor isn't working when I reboot, and it always fixes it.\n\n\nI haven't tried my entire steam library yet, but every steam game that I have tried so far just works in Linux, as easily as it would in Windows. A far cry from the Loki Games days where there were 5 or 6 games being manually ported to Linux. I have not ever been able to keep World of Warcraft consistently running on my Linux system. I might be able to get it working until I do a kernel update or Blizzard does a client update. So your mileage may vary if you do a lot of online gaming. But the scene is *very good* right now.",

We're pretty used to minority coalitions with some support deal in parliament; we haven't had a single party have majority nationally in this millennium. Party membership has been on the decline for a while, but it's still fairly normal to work with someone who's a member of some political party. Which is to say: Political affiliations are protected information (your employer can't make you disclose it), but discussions aren't taboo, and it's pretty expected that people have varying opinions, rather than having to lump everyone into team red vs team blue.\n* We have pretty strong labour rights and unions, and are pretty habituated to the [tripartite cooperation](https://snl.no/trepartssamarbeid) of labour unions, employer unions and the government.\n* We like to think we have a pretty flat hierarchy, where it's expected that you're able to contradict and argue with your boss in meetings.\n* (We also don't really have words like \"sir\" or \"madam\" in our language any more; those fell out of use, oh, around a century ago?)\n\nSo for us I'd kind of expect a labour union like [Tekna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekna_(Norway\\)) or [NITO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Society_of_Engineers_and_Technologists) to be involved in having the backs of employees, but also in informing employees in what's expected to be acceptable and what's not.\n\nThat doesn't mean that everything is sunshine and butterflies, but we might be a bit more predisposed to the idea that employees can and will push back on the stuff their employers want.\n\n> The real question the paper doesn't answer: who's going to pay for quality information if not advertisers?\n\nAt least here in Norway I'd expect tax money to  be a part of the discussion, in a way that'd probably be … somewhat contentious over in Silicon Valley.

I don't know what you really mean when you say \"democratic\" here. On one hand, you might be referring to \"software being for everyone\", but then you are perhaps unwittingly mixing in related concepts that are unrelated to software. What makes something \"unethical software\", exactly? It reads to be very vague and arbitrarily, unfortunately, without specific definitions of what you actually mean.\n\nAnd talking about specifics, I think the only unethical stuff in relation to open-source software is proprietary software, pseudo-open source (think shared source where you can see the code, but aren't allowed to do anything with it), and LLM-generated slop that is currently inundating open source project merge request and issue boards ~ slop that might have been derived from LLMs training on proprietary code, for one.",

Basically *writing* quality code, crafting architecture is a mentally fulfilling activity for many. You envision something, implement it and feel great when the whole thing starts working and always have a sense of learning and accomplishment! I shifted into SWE because I passionately loved coding and how code all works together in some architecture.\n\nOn the other hand, *reading* existing code in order to understand it and find bugs - especially if it's subpar LLM-generated AI slop - is a boring chore compared to the joys of writing it. It's unfulfilling, mentally taxing and it's easy to miss important things.\n\nIt's not fun! I'm often guilty of procrastinating PR reviews. Who *enjoys* reviewing a hundreds line long PR?!\n\nLLMs shift engineering activity away from writing code towards reading code i.e. they take away the fun parts and introduce more of the unfun parts. They also lessen the human discussion and connection part and instead we're mindlessly chatting with a machine all day. \n\nHeck, they even degrade our thinking - at least with web search, we've had to make the final decision about a piece of information or adapt some solution to fit our problem. Now, we're spoon-fed with generative solutions that may or may not work.\n\nI like programming computers but I don't like outsourcing my thinking to probabilistic black boxes and labeling *that* as \"productivity\". I don't like the most fun parts being taken away from this profession.\n\nOf course, many folks just treat code as a means to an end already. They may be good engineers who just don't like coding as much. Or they are managers, CTOs etc. who may have liked coding before but don't have the time for it any more. For them, it's totally understandable that whipping out Claude Code in order to create something between two meetings can be amazingly fun. But not for me!\n\nI'm not sure where all this will go but maybe I need some exit plan out of this profession even though I have achieved quite much. I already barely tolerate the pressure from AI hype, the anxiety that it causes and the burnout that it may bring.",

The effort lies not in the mixing of pigments, the understanding of light, or the stroke of the brush, but merely in the utterance of a fashionable incantation.\n\nTheir code is not architected; it is wished into existence, a precarious tower of incantations copied from distant scrolls, held together by hope and the toil of the libraries they do not comprehend. They speak in vagaries of \"energy\" and \"flow,\" mistaking the absence of rigour for the presence of genius, and believe that debugging is a spiritual journey rather than a disciplined exercise in logic.\n\nLet it be known: to manipulate the very logic of machines, to command the silicon with precision, is a pursuit worthy of the title Developer. It is a vocation of structure, of relentless reason, of building with materials one thoroughly understands. What these \"vibe coders\" practice is not development; it is digital dabbling. They are not builders of empires, but mere decorators of rented rooms, blind to the foundations beneath their feet and doomed to bewilderment when the walls—as they inevitably must—begin to crack.\n\nThe court of genuine achievement has no throne for such hollow pretension. They may play at creation, but they reside in the gallery of consumers, mistaking the act of curation for the sweat of genesis. A most tiresome and decadent trend, indeed.",

Perhaps we could move towards reducing incidental complexity from our systems in a way that would make it possible for mathematical reasoning to scale better.\n\nMy main point is that theorem provers could eliminate the core flaw of llms to be unreliable and hallucinate and that both technologies are only at the start of their development.",

But I may be wrong. Or maybe people would lose interest once this turns into a nihilism speedrun because that gets boring pretty quick.",

When enough people vote for the end of democracy, then so be it. Any political system can be changed to another at the will of those in control of it. Democracy is not any different.\n\nPersonally, I'm a firm believer in democracy, and it makes me sad seeing change to a different system, but then again this project is not controlling anything in our lives, so the point is that people are just trolling with that and see this as entertainment.\n\nIt's a rather long shot to relate this to a political system. In addition voting is often only the most interactive aspect of a democracy. But to reduce a democracy to just voting is a simplification. There are political systems that let people vote, but that's it. A strong political democracy has free press, separation of powers, rule of law, active participation, and fundamental rights and equality *in addition* to voting. A political system where people cannot choose *what to vote on* is not a democracy.",

I was working at a natural language processing company at that time, and it's relatively common in NLP stuff to download dumps of Wikipedia page texts to use for training purposes, since Wikipedia has a large amount of text in a lot of different languages, and conveniently packages up dumps of all of its content every night. Someone I worked with at the time made a post on Twitter about how this Scots Wikipedia thing exposed a major issue with using Wikipedia (and internet data at large) for these kinds of purposes. The fact that the AI bros are only just realizing this now is pretty funny to me.",

It's like beaming a SETI message into space - you're hoping that it gets picked up randomly, but the chance of that happening is vanishingly small considering modern AI training typically involves finetuning with highly curated data, not random content from every website.",

A common issue is \"death by a thousand cuts\" - a bunch of *small* inefficiencies add up and are almost impossible to profile as they just appear as noise.\n2. When you have tasks indirectly dependant on other tasks, it can be very unclear where optimizations actually can help. I have a sprite resampling mod for a game. The hashing algorithm is pretty quick, but speeding it up even more still helps the game's render thread keep going, but it also helps keep data getting pushed to the worker threads so that they actually have things to do. A marginal improvement in performance results in a lot of tasks getting done sooner and reduces latency.\n\nAlso noting that measuring (except if you're using very specific tools) won't always tell you what's *actually* causing the slowdown, only what's being slow. Aside from the macro cases of awaiting something else (like IO), this applies to things like cache invalidations (usually due to false sharing or not using non-temporal access where appropriate). The thing *causing* the slowdown is hidden in the profile - what it's made slow is what pops up.",

Depending on what you want to actually use the measurements for, different metrics offer different benefits. I wrote about that [here](https://modulovalue.com/blog/statistical-methods-for-reliable-benchmarks/#different-metrics-for-different-questions): \n\n* **Fastest (minimum)**: \"How fast can this code run?\" An existence proof of capability. Best for comparing pure algorithms where you want to isolate the code from system noise.\n* **Median**: \"How fast does this code typically run?\" Robust against outliers. Best for understanding typical performance under normal conditions.\n* **Mean (average)**: \"What is the total time cost?\" Essential for capacity planning and throughput calculations where every millisecond counts toward the total.\n\nThere's also the question of which tools one should use. I used standard file IO library that Dart comes with, but I also tried reimplementing it via FFI and It was only a few percent faster so that was a waste of time. One person linked to a blogpost about [Off-CPU Flame Graphs](https://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/offcpuflamegraphs.html) and I think it would be nice to have better tooling in those areas that make it easier to collect data that we can then derive metrics from.",

              "text": "I think that's a fair critique of the title. You're right that \"I/O\" is imprecise here. The bottleneck was really per-file overhead: the accumulated cost of 300,000+ syscalls, filesystem metadata lookups, inode resolution, and directory traversal. The SSD itself was capable of 5-7 GB/s but I was getting 80 MB/s, not because the storage was slow, but because of everything that happens between \"read this file\" and actually getting the bytes.\n\nOne of the commenters (ori\\_b) made a similar point: the user/kernel context switch itself is maybe 50ns on modern hardware, so 300,000 switches only account for about 2% of the 14.5 seconds. The rest is the work happening inside each syscall: filesystem metadata lookups, dentry resolution, random access latency on NVMe (\\~50-100us per read). So \"syscall overhead\" is also slightly misleading. \"Per-file overhead\" is probably the most accurate framing.\n\nI updated the post with an addendum covering this distinction, but you're right that the title could do a better job. The core finding is that going from 104,000 individual file opens to 1,351 archive reads eliminated most of that per-file overhead, giving a 43x I/O improvement. Whether you call that \"I/O\" or \"the boundary between user and kernel space\" or \"per-file overhead\" is partly semantic, but precision matters and the title is sloppy about it.",

What makes it easier than rust Is that doesn't have lifetime annotations. So it infers them. You write \\`function foo(x: &string): &string\\`, not \\`fn foo<'a>(x: &'a str) -> &'a str\\`.

I'm going to fix this blog example, it's misleading as written.\n\nFurthermore, it is not a perfect project. It is missing a lot of features and is not ready for production.

Without annotations, how do you distinguish between the lifetimes for these functions?\n\n```\n\nfn first<'a, 'b>(a: &'a str, b: &'b str) -> &'a str { a }\n\nfn second<'a, 'b>(a: &'a str, b: &'b str) -> &'b str { b }\n\nfn random<'out, 'a: 'out, 'b: 'out>(\n  a: &'a str,\n  b: &'b str\n) -> &'out str {\n  if rand::random::<bool>() { a } else { b }\n}\n\n```\n\nRemember that:\n\n1. Rust's lifetime elision handles all the toy examples just fine. You only need annotations for the stuff that's actually tricky.\n2. The lifetime annotations in these examples ensures that you can't accidentally return `b` from `first` or `a` from `second`.",

I'm sure you have put a lot of good work into this that you can be proud of, and I don't mean to be discouraging, but I tend to be skeptical about these projects. Rust is not complex for the sake of it, but precisely because it aims to address all the concerns that you mention: \n\n* Type safety: very nice to have, but what inheritance / interfaces, static / dynamic polymorphism, const-ness, generics and variance, etc.\n* No GC: it's great to take inspiration from the borrow checker, but can you make it any simpler to work with? Will there be pointers / references? How do you handle mutability? And lifetimes? Will there be Rc, Box, etc.? What is the lifecycle of objects? How are they destroyed / drop?\n\nAnd that is before you think of multithreading. By the time you solve all of the above you may find you have converged back to full Rust.\n\nAgain, I truly don't mean to discourage you. Perhaps your aims are not as comprehensive and you can trade off some language features for simplicity.",
