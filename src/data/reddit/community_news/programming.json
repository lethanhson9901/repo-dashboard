I've also had to pull out 30% of the dev capacity because it wasn't making margin while we bring in basic release management, automated test, working CI/CD and other patterns.\n\nThere's a massive co-hort of of engineers <35 who've never put together a big 6 month release, and it shows. I've had to bring back old-ass practices into play like formal gold candidate releases etc - the type of shit you did when you were shipping CD-ROMs - just to tighten up a monthly major release that was creating havoc with client escalations month after month. We're quietly rebuilding the entire deployment pipeline, encapsulating code and services and putting proper interfaces in, and getting ready to shift off some old technology decisions, but it's a slow process.\n\nThere's far too many people in the industry who can only code to an explicit instruction from a senior, and don't have the skills to identify re-use opportunities etc. AI will just produce more of that explosion of non-talent in my view.",

Because I don’t need high level thinking, what I need is someone to pair with who knows bog standard typescript better than I do, which is a low bar. And the bonus is what it does something flagrantly wrong or non-idiomatic I _generally_ can smell it from a mile away and can at least glean what not to do even from bad sessions. \n\nAll that being said I also get extremely frustrated with the capriciousness and lack of cohesion of the js ecosystem. There are a few shining beacons of logic and reasonable convention but most of the time I am just baffled that it caught on because so much of it is opinionated while also being sectarian so it feels like you have to struggle through a half dozen reinvented wheels, you need to reinvent a half dozen wheels, then maybe you find a workflow that doesn’t result in a bunch of make work wheel spinning. It’s no wonder most models veer in your doing over complex wordy galaxy brained shit, the corpus varies so wildly across all dimensions of quality and cohesiveness.",

A good senior develoepr that cleanly understands how to do all aspects of coding is enhanced by AI because AI can code faster than you for a lot of things. For example, it will blow me out of the water writing unit tests.\n\n2. A junior developer will immediately level up to an intermediate because the AI is already better than them. It knows how to code, it understands a lot of the simpler aspects of coding quite well, and it can simply churn out decent code pretty fast if you're good enough with it.\n\n3. A junior developer will be hard capped in their skill progression by AI. They will become too reliant on it and struggle to understand things on their own. They won't be able to give you answers without the AI nor will they understand when the AI is wrong. And worse, they won't be inquisitive enough to question the AI. They'll run into bugs they have to debug and have no idea what to do, where to start, etc.\n\nI stand by it as my experience in the workplace has shown.

Maybe they use AI to do 99% of their work or 1% of their work. As a manager, I only use it for super boring crap like converting a code base in one language to a code base in another language.\n\nBut the design department's use of AI is more interesting. Our design department has 70 designers, and only 10 of those 70 are kind of technical. The other 60 designers sit around designing all these design experiences in Figma, way way faster than the engineers can implement the designs.\n\nAnd it's not even clear whether we *should* implement all the designer's designs. Their designs look prettier and probably are a better user experience, but that doesn't necessarily make us more money. We have lots of designers because our software makes billions and it's fine, but they mostly sit around unhappy that their designs don't make it into product.\n\nSo in late 2025 they all started just asking the AI to implement their designs. And that works, at least in a prototyping sense. So now they're all using their own designs in prototype form. And I know a couple of them have changed their own designs, based on the results of the prototype.\n\nThis is super productive, because now instead of having to harass my engineers to implement bad designs, they only have to harass my engineers to implement well tested, fully prototyped designs, that have already had many rounds of design iteration.\n\nOf course I know my engineers just copy and paste the AI prototype code into the real codebase.

Also I work in small chunks and I am usually scaffolding the code by hand and then having it fill in the blanks.\n\nI will say though that if you get carried away you can easily feel disconnected from the code and it feels less like something you wrote and more like a third party library you are consuming. Ultimately it is speed up but you spend far more time reading code than writing it when doing it this way.\n\nBut letting it handle C++ template errors is worth it alone.

The fact that they found no statistically significant productivity gains *is* the far more interesting finding, but it's not what they were looking for, and it's not the best study design for looking at that. It is of course still surprising that they found no evidence that AI users are faster when the AI knows the library and the people do not.\n\nThe fair comparison would be on a population that's familiar with the library, half with AI, half without. And where they're allowed to use agents rather than just chat, since one would expect that to be faster. And perhaps accounting for what they're able to multitask on while the AI is responding, though I personally suspect that the context switching there doesn't actually lend itself to much efficient multitasking, at least not between high-demand tasks, probably just things like getting a coffee.\n\nBut I think that would still be a largely academic study with little real-world value. I personally would want to compare devs in a large existing codebase that they're familiar with, and include code quality metrics and QA feedback as metrics. That's supposed to be the tradeoff, and so any result other than AI being as slow or slower (a result most people don't expect) doesn't help much, since it doesn't tell you the price you're paying. I expect that to be a difficult study, since I would expect different types of AI use to have vastly different impacts on code quality. For example I suspect that just using GitHub copilot auto complete would have virtually no impact, whereas vibecoding would produce irredeemable trash.",

Namely, writing tests. And what I’ve noticed is two things: 1) the AI has no frame of reference for all the requirements for the code and thus for writing tests, its primary concern is writing ones that will pass. Sometimes the process of testing exposes bugs in your code, but the AI will then adjust the test to pass the bug case. And 2) I know that I am getting worse at writing and verifying tests on my own for lack of practice. \n\nThese are just issues in relatively insignificant avenues of use. I worry a lot for newer devs who I know are just writing things with AI and skipping over both comprehension of the codebase and the ability to troubleshoot. I’ve brought this up as a concern but of course, the execs hand wave away anything negative about AI. Idk what koolaid they’re all drinking, when they go out to conferences they must be getting wined and dined by OpenAI",

LLMs turned basically into a \"high level programming language\", just one with unpredictable compiler. It's what developers have been doing for many years already - make highly expressive programming languages, where you write little code and get a lot of functionality. Oneliner in Python could be hundreds lines of C or thousands lines of assembly. This is just another step - oneliner prompt could be hundreds of lines of python. With the caveat that this \"compiler\" is not deterministic and often generates incorrect code... When you compile your C code to a binary, you don't disassemble it to inspect the assembly and verify it's correct, you trust that the compiler works fine. With LLMs no such guarantees exist.\n\n> This is partly because composing prompts and giving context to the LLM takes a lot of time, sometimes comparable as writing the code manually.\n\nAs for the detail level of prompts - that's also nothing new. Anyone who has been programming for more than 10-15 years has seen this. We've been here before. What vibe coders re-discovered as \"LLM spec driven development\" is nothing more than what used to be called \"Model Driven Development\" - that was the idea that non-developers could simply draw UML diagrams and generate software from that. And there are still tools that actually let you do that! The twist? To get what you really wanted the diagrams would have to be as detailed as the code would be, which essentially turned this into a \"graphical programming language\" and those non-developers became developers of this weird language.\nThat's exactly what we see now with LLMs - people simply became \"programmers\" of this weird prompt programming language. Unfortunately as far as programming languages go, it's a very bad one...",

I think this tool is good for supporting and helping me understand certain things. It works well as a quick syntax check or name suggestion. I also use it for front-end generation because it's always a pain for me; I don't like HTML, JavaScript, and so on. But in my projects, I don't need fancy pages and flashing buttons; I want it to be as simple and readable as possible, so I often dump entire HTML/JS code structures into AI. Unfortunately, search engines like Google are pushing us to AI chats. It's hard to find tutorials for anything specific these days. Besides, I don't think they're being updated, I have that impression. For example, we want a tutorial on creating a login/logout page in Django, and I often find outdated solutions. It's better on YT, but ctrl+c ctrl+v won't work (although apparently no one does that :-) everyone always writes each line themselves :-))",

Utilizing frameworks like speckit to discover if AI can create complete features if given a good enough prompt.  \nThe overwhelming answer is no, it struggles a lot with complex business (and even simple) requirements due to lacking domain knowledge. For a feature which would have taken me a couple of business days to complete it took the AI and me almost a week. This is because I had to debug and refactor a lot of the code it wrote without the normal context that I would have if I wrote it myself.  \nI've seen this repeated a few times and while I got better at prompting, AI still didn't come close to my own speed.  \n  \nOn the other hand I have used AI (Claude cli) in my personal project (from inception) for the past couple of months and it is still incredibly useful, it doesn't struggle with finding files, finding modules, running tests etc.  And it can do complete features with only a bit of dev work at the end to \"fix\" the code\nI think because AI wrote it from the ground up the project is structured in the way that it expects and so is able to get context of what it needs quickly and with fewer tokens.  \n\nI think AI struggles with pre existing code bases because it's trained to understand the \"average\" repo structure.",

The high scorers only asked AI conceptual questions instead of code generation or asked for explanations to accompany generated code; these usage patterns demonstrate a high level of cognitive engagement\n\nThis is not a paper about how AI use can rot your brain, even though the headline would suggest so. This is a paper about how you have to use AI \"the right way\". \n\nI would *really* like to let my confirmation bias do the work for me - I think these tools are junk and a net harm on society - but basic skepticism says this paper really needs to be considered with a great deal of scrutiny.",

          "text": "Oh, boy. It's another round of reddit finds an AI paper that has a nuanced take on AI, and waves it around like a flag to justify their refusal to adapt to a changing world. You guys are starting to remind me of the people who constantly bitched about cellphones when they first came out or the guy who insists that everyone he meets hears about how he doesn't own a tv.\n\nIf you actually read the methodology instead of just the abstract, you’d see this paper isn't the \"AI is useless\" smoking gun you guys so desperately crave.\n\nThe study wasn't measuring senior devs churning out code they've written a thousand times and already understand. It was looking at novice workers trying to learn a completely new library from scratch.\n\nThe \"no productivity gain\" headline is misleading. The average speed was dragged down because some participants spent massive amounts of time (up to 30%) just composing queries and trying to get the prompt right. There was a group, the AI Delegators, who just let the model do the work. They finished the fastest.\n\n\nThe catch is that the pure delegators tanked the post-coding quiz scores (39%) because they bypassed the learning process entirely.\n\nWhat the \"AI kills coding\" crowd is missing is that it is possible to use AI while still building competency. The paper explicitly identified \"High-Scoring Interaction Patterns\" that preserved skill formation. Participants who used the AI to ask conceptual questions (Why does this work?) instead of just asking for code generation scored 65% on the evaluation, higher than the delegators and at comparable levels to the average of the no-AI group. People who asked for code and an explanation had high learning outcomes than all but the top end of the non-AI group.\n\n**The Generation-Then-Comprehension group actually scored higher on comprehension (86% vs 65%) than the non-AI group, although they did take slightly longer.** But the \"humans are getting lazy from using AI\" group didn't bother to read past the title and abstract of this study.\n\nThe breakdown is basically this:\n\n1. The Conceptual Inquiry group was faster than the non-AI group and scored comparable to them.\n2. The Hybrid Code-Explanation group was slightly slower than non-AI and scored slightly higher than them.\n3. The Generation-Then-Comprehension group was also slightly slower than the non-AI group, but scored the highest on comprehension.\n\nThe authors aren't saying, \"don't use AI.\" They're saying don't use AI to bypass learning. It’s evidence of what anyone in education could tell you. Cognitive offloading kills learning. If you treat the AI as a magic answer box, you stunt your growth. If you treat it as a tutor and stay cognitively engaged, you get the utility without the brain rot.\n\nThis isn't the slam dunk you think it is. It's a critical analysis of what works and what doesn't. But this sub doesn't care about that. They just have an emotional need to feel validated in hating AI tools.",

If you actually give a shit about decomposing problems thoroughly, it should take a lot of time. Writing the code IS RARELY THE HARD PART.

One is to double-down on AI and accept their role as a faux tech lead instructing AI who is kind of a moron junior dev with short-term memory loss issues. Another is to reject and denounce AI completely and shit on every use of AI.\n\nBoth are overcorrections. There is a balance where LLMs are just a tool and not a replacement for thinking. Over-reliance on any tool causes skill atrophy. Don’t believe me? Go build a twitter-clone using a plain text editor. You cannot use anything else except that plain text editor and the command line.

I am guessing no.\n\nI think many people are rightly concerned that AI does help much with learning the details of a piece of software, compared to coding yourself, and how does this affect programmer's knowledge about the systems they write and maintain. It seems reasonable that if you just spend your days telling the AI to do the work and go drink coffee, you won't learn a lot. But used right, it can assist both with developing and with learning.\n\nI'd just like to comment that this is a study.\n\nThe task was making small fundamental programming tasks on an unknown API. Out in the real world, using AI to start working with a project or tool does not save time immediately - it takes some ramp up time before you will see efficiency gains. Once you have set up the AI (using CLAUDE MD, Claude Skills, MCP, or other ways) so that it starts with the right context about your stack and procedures and can talk to git, project management tools, read logs and check itself, it becomes a LOT faster to develop with it.\n\nBut before you spend the time interating to get a good setup, you are not going to be saving a lot of time.\n\nEdit:  Haha, so many downvotes 🤣 I guess it is what you get for reasoned argument based on actual working experience using AI day to day in real complex production systems.

He would assign tasks/work and give deadlines. I remember multiple times when I was working on a task, I would come to a proverbial fork in the road and a decision about how to approach the problem would come up that I could see affecting future programming work.\n\nI would meet with him, explain the problem and the different ideas I had to approach it and what I thought the downstream effects would be. I was hoping he could either give me an answer on what approach to take (whether it was one that I already presented or a novel one), or a rule of thumb to use, or really just any guidance so I could finish the task.\n\nInstead, he would waffle on the importance and criticality of making the right decision (which was obvious, that’s why I was there asking him instead of just doing what I personally thought was best) and that I should implement both ways and then gather data on how they worked so that I could make a data driven decision. Except 1) I was mostly worried about issues down the road, not immediate issues. I can’t gather data on future theoretical issues, and 2) it takes much longer to implement both solutions and then test them both than to just choose one. And he was the one who gave me the deadlines in the first place so he should know about them. I guess he expected me to crunch and work late to still meet them.\n\nAnyways, in order to preserve my evenings, weekends and sanity, I stopped asking him these types of questions and just went with the solution I thought was best at the time. Because if an issue ever arose that was caused by my design choice earlier, he couldn’t really blame me for not being able to see the future and anticipate the problem since I had justification for why I designed it the way I did.",

It's about the perception of not knowing and the perception that brings to the people around you, and wether that makes you closer or further from being let go. \n\nBasically if you have to ask, it's proof that you don't know something. Which can and is totally fine! In the right environment, with the right people. I worked at a place where asking questions got you snide remarks and side eyes and \"omfg can you believe this guy\" and I learned QUICKLY to just shut the fuck up and better be thought the fool than prove it. It goes without saying these people were ass holes and some of them didn't like me too much. So any perception of not knowing- not good. Any bothering to get a question answered was met with \"how do you not know already\" energy, almost always.\n\nAnd that makes you go into survival mode... because getting fired can mean homelessness here in the ol' US of A, and quickly, with virtually no safety net of any kind to catch your fall. Better to take your chances and wing it and get it right/interact with A holes *less*, as opposed to bugging the powers that be even *more* and risking getting let go.\n\nIn my current job, it's all the other way around. I'm well liked, and consulted frequently for my expertise and opinion. They want my help as much as possible, and not knowing is *okay* in this environment. I don't have to survive. So I say \"damn, I have literally no idea... But I'm sure I can figure it out, that's my job after all!\" And with this group, that's seen as a strength. As a positive.\n\nIn the end it's not about avoiding humans. It's about avoiding ass holes. People don't like feeling stupid, being put down, or seeing they are thought less of, and all are possible when you \"interact with people,\" especially for contractors imo.",

I’ve definitely seen plenty of devs and especially management who look down on anyone who doesn’t check off these “good question” boxes, but this reasoning doesn't even make sense once you stop and think about it. How are you supposed to understand the problem before you ask a question about it? Timing and prioritization - who the hell is so strapped for time that they can’t answer a question? And self confidence - where is one supposed to get this without being empowered to solve the problem!\n\nPeople in this damn industry really need to learn empathy and realize that not every question needs to be fully thought out. I’ve had too many shit tier bosses that don’t understand this; glad I’m finally on a team with a manager who appreciates that I’m the guy on the team who asks the “dumb questions”.

Humans only seem to do that because they actually have a massive context.\n\nThis is actually a classic example of a problem with AI. When you tell an AI to do something, what prevents it from killing all humans to do it? Nothing inherently, you have to actually train it so that “killing all humans” is a massive negative in the reward function so it doesn’t land on that.\n\nBut then, what prevents it from putting all humans into a coma? You have to add that in too, there’s nothing inherent about a reward function that limits humans in comas as a negative.\n\nThis problem blows up because it turns out, in order to make an AI that actually “does the right thing” you have to encode the entirety of human morality into it up front so it doesn’t land on a choice that involves something horribly unethical. \n\nThis is not trivial and in fact, if AI was smart enough to figure this all out on its own, it would actually be able to turn us all into [paperclips anyway](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/ai-and-paperclip-problem).\n\nI’ll close by saying be careful what you wish for with regards to AI because the optimal solution to your problem most definitely involves killing all humans ",

The programmer will be quiet the whole meeting. Then, at some point the programmer will ask a vague question about what we just discussed and had resolved as a group 5 minutes ago.\n\nFor example, we'll discuss the DB to use for 35 minutes. We figure out that we can't use a simple BigQuery MV for our needs. We figure out the path to a solution which is a bit more complicated, but will work perfectly. We ask if everyone agrees or has ideas of why it might not work. No concerns raised. Even the programmer in question is nodding in approval, which is important because he'll be building this DB and system.\n\nOkay. Decided. We have the plan. Sweet.\n\nThen we start discussing how downstream systems will work with the info, and it's all aligned. Perfect.\n\nOh, Programmer interrupts someone else while they are talking. To ask a question.\n\n\"Where is the information being stored?\"\n\nHuh? We look around. No one knows what he means.\n\n\"So, in order for these downstream systems to use the data, it must be stored somewhere. I know this because I have worked in data for a long time.  You guys are lucky I caught this. Lol. We can't just use data. It has to come from somewhere and then  be stored in order to be queried. We can just use probably BigQuery. That's what I recommend. We should store the data in big query.\"\n\nIt's painful because not only has he not been paying attention this entire meeting, but also the system he works on is BigQuery and ALREADY HAS THE DATA.  We were trying to figure out how to get the data into something that will work for the use cases, which we just discussed and agreed upon. He agreed to it a few minutes ago but he doesn't have any clue what he agreed to.\n\nSo, one by one, he asks the questions which were already discussed in the meeting and the doc outlining the purpose of the meeting and how his own system works.\n\nMultiple hours later, we end up agreeing again to the same system that we had already agreed upon.  The programmer in question agrees to build the system. Again. I offer to create a doc outlining exactly what he agreed to build, if he needs it. He says he doesn't need the doc but would like it anyway, just so others can be on the same page as him. Okay.\n\nI create the doc. It outlines the entire plan we all agreed upon, beginning to end. I give it to programmer. It should take maybe three days. He says it'll take about one. Cool.\n\nThree weeks later, he's done. After heavy pressure from leadership.\n\nFucking A. He ignored the entire doc and created a MV in Big Query that accomplished zero of the use cases and based on the GCP logs, he created the MV one hour after leadership pressured him.\n\nAnd then we have more meetings, and he's asking the exact same questions all over again.",

How do the seniors handle questions?

Occasionally the answer was just \"No reason, I'm just more familiar with this method\", and a couple times it was \"That might actually be a better solution, we should look into it.\"\n\nI was fine with every one of those responses. The problem I've run into on some other teams is that some seniors take personal offense when you question them. But I also came to realize that this is usually because they can't actually answer those questions. As a result, they're usually pretty good at shutting down discussions.\n\nSide note - this is a separate issue from the more systemic issue of people being scared to ask questions because managers interpret questions as incompetence or otherwise use those questions against the person asking them. That's also a common issue, but it affects everyone, not just the juniors.\n\ntl;dr If you want juniors who ask questions, ensure you have seniors who answer them.",

A few projects - for example, the space-shuttle software - have achieved a level of 0 defects in 500,000 lines of code using a system of format development methods, peer reviews, and statistical testing.\"\n\nLoC matters.

Often by reading existing code, just for the act of reading it, you can find bugs or improvements. Obviously it is a hard sell to tell your boss \"hey we should just read our code\". Refactoring or a rewrite of code is continuation of that reading and understanding, can't refactor what you don't know.\n\n\nHowever, I do find that often re-writes create new bugs because it can very easily mis recreating behavior that was originally a mistake but now other code depends on that incorrect behavior. ",

It's not that I don't care, it's that I only go down the new queue a few times a day. I do remove the things you're talking about, but generally I'm seeing them after they've been up for a few hours. I was traveling over the holidays and pretty busy this weekend and more stuff stayed up than usual, sorry about that.\n\nThe biggest category of posts that I remove is demos (\"I made this\"). After that it's random AI related things that have nothing to do with programming, and after that it's support/forum questions. (That last one may surprise you but if you saw the quality of them you'd understand.) [I wrote more about this here](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chs4ib/the_state_of_the_subreddit_may_2024/) but as you can see it's been some time.\n\nI've really love to get some more mods, but I'm very concerned about finding people that I can trust. Some of the more active users here (which is what reddit's find-a-mod feature uses) are really inappropriate to become mods. I'm not sure what other criteria that I can find to keep it from becoming a drama fest.\n\nI'm not happy with the current situation either, but I'm not sure how to make it better. I'm doing my best. Mods aren't paid by reddit so you're shouting \"I sure wish somebody else would do more free work for my pleasure!\". And honestly I'm with you, I wish there were an easier way to deal with this. But until there is, I'll keep doing my best.",

Often it takes a 2nd pair of eyes to spot dud phrasing.)\n\nThe percentage of false positives would go up in a Slop Arms Race. I'm not saying, \"don't monitor\", only that the problems of bots are not going away. Some sloppineers are probably using Reddit as a bot-testing-ground even.\n\nI like that term, \"**sloppineers**\", don't know if I coined it, but if so, my human ego loves credit!",

It's almost more exhausting than AI slop. I don't know what it's going to take to change, but if you ever want to karma farm, just post this and you'll be golden. It doesn't seem to have changed and always goes the same way. Some AI bro steps in to tell us all how AI is going to cure cancer, world hunger and inequality tomorrow and how we're stupid for not wanting to talk more about it, people argue, AI bro gets downvoted harder than Claude trying to fix an issue in a real codebase. Wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nI also think this is likely exacerbated for many of us by the fact that we probably all to some extent report to MBAs and execs who seem to have the idea that AI can just do all of our jobs. I hear enough (and solve enough of it's issues) at work, I come to this sub hoping for good devs writing cool shit I can look at or read about or have conversations about. So seeing vibecoded content take up the bulk of the sub is frustrating because the people vibe-coding aren't exactly going to be particularly knowledgeable about their code.",

Here is the rant:\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nAs you may notice, this page and pretty much the entire website were obviously created with the help of AI. I wonder how you could tell? Was it a big \"Written With Claude\" badge on every page? I moved it to the top now (with the help of AI of course) to make it even more obvious. There are a few blogposts that were written by me manually, the old-fashioned way, I hope there will be more in the future, and those have a similar \"Human Written\" badge. This project (not the website), on the other hand, is a very, very different story. It took me more than two years of painstaking and unpaid work in my own free time. A story that, hopefully, I will tell someday. But meanwhile, what would you like me to do? To create a complex documentation website with a bunch of highly technical articles with the help of AI and fake it, to give you an illusion that I also did that manually? Like the half of itnernet is doing at this point? How does that makes any sense? Is that even fair to you? Or maybe to create this website manually, the old-fashioned way, just for you? While working a paid job for a salary, most of you wouldn't even get up in the morning. Would you like me to sing you a song while we're at it? For your personal entertainment? Seriously, get a grip. Do you find this information less valuable because of the way this website was created? I give my best to fix it to keep the information as accurate as possible, and I think it is very accurate at this point. If you find some mistakes, inaccurancies or problems, there is a comment section at the bottom of every page, which I also made with the help of the AI. And I woould very much appreciate if you leave your feedback there. Look, I'm just a guy who likes SQL, that's all. If you don't approve of how this website was constructed and the use of AI tools, I suggest closing this page and never wever coming back. And good riddance.

For instance, a controversial or volatile project with a well defined estimate may shield the team from undue pressure or negative performance review in the event the project falters. \n\nI would also add that it’s better to *forecast* than it would be to use the verb “estimate”. Estimating the cost of materials is quantitative and generally fixed but its much harder to estimate service/labor costs. You don’t know what you don’t know, and you often uncover new information in software work that impacts the costs. In software development, this is more analogous to weather forecasting. We can forecast the costs of this software project based on current conditions, but that forecast is always subject to change as new information emerges.",

                  "text": "I never said don’t estimate at all, but instead to call it “forecasting”. It is a better name for it. \n\nBut to answer your question, forecasting gets better the longer you do it and have a history of completed work. New teams and new projects mean you need to start over. Over time, you get a sense of complexity, scope, capacity,  velocity, and team dynamics. \n\nSo on a new team/project, we would start by *guessing*. What feels right, right now? Listen to your gut. \n\nThen after a sprint, retro. What worked, what didn’t, what could we improve? Inspect and adapt. \n\nThe next time you forecast, more becomes clear. \n\n> “We thought that task was going to be hard, but it was easy. Now that that task is done, this is clearly a 1 pointer.” \n\nAlso, if using points and just starting out, I like to ask my team “we need a signal that something is too complex and needs to be broken down further. Let’s figure out how many points a complex task that might take an entire sprint might be.” If using modified fibbonacci with a point system like 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 100, for instance, I find most of my teams will say “I can definitely get an 8 pointer done before the end of sprint, but a 12 is likely too large” for instance. Now if we ever point a task as a 12 or higher, we know its at-risk of carrying over and is likely too complex, this is a signal that we either don’t know enough to solve it yet, or we need to break it down into smaller pieces to maintain consistent delivery.\n\nNext retro:\n> “We thought that task was going to be easy, but it was so hard we couldn’t even get it done in a sprint! That task was probably not a 5, but more like a 12 or 20!!”\n\nAfter a few of these cycles, you suddenly understand so much more about your team and the project. You now know that if you forecast anything larger than a 8, it’s probably not ready. You know now that your team of four engineers has completed on average 30 points of work per sprint, that is your velocity. That is also close to 4 engineers x 8 pts per sprint = 32 points of forecasted velocity, which validates your forecasting. You now know that you can expect a capacity of about 30 pts per sprint. You now likely know more about your project, too. You now can start measuring reliability. \n\nThat’s how I do it in a mature, medium to large organization. I have been working with smaller VC startups lately and for those teams I don’t forecast at all. YAGNI. Don’t add planning and overhead you don’t need, until you need it. \n\nMore tips: experiment. Play around. Every team and project is different, take the opportunity to experiment. Observe. Reflect. Keep what works. Drop what doesn’t. For forecasting Ive used points but also t-shirt sizes instead sometimes. It’s all tools in the toolbox, and you should pick the tools for the job.",

This is one of the not-so-obvious failures by technical folks -- not being transparent about what costs they are signing up for. Or worse, the developer says they are implementing a quick and dirty solution, but hand-wave away the costs by saying it should be easy to fix later. But they don't go into detail about what that cost will be later, when later needs to be, and who the dependencies are for later. And that's ignoring the fact that they are not constantly rebasing the expected cost of later with coming changes that the developer might not be able to foresee. That's one of the things managers actually do for us -- they are constantly rebasing the expected cost with the actual cost. So, more info given to them allows them to do that better.",

There have been times where it was possible and times when it wasn't.\n\nWhen it was working well, pointing was a tool to force honest discussion around how much we truly understood the problem, triggering you to trade off scope, break down further, etc. We followed the agile process in a reasonable way and had buy in from the engineering team. They knew it was to help us plan and roadmap, not to judge team performance.\n\nIt stopped working as the team dwindled in size and we moved from a team taking on tasks from a sprint backlog to a kanban approach where team members were often more closely tied to particular types of work and we had much less team ownership when something didn't go as planned. In particular, the engineering team management decided it wasn't important to challenge the team to make hard decisions around scope. \n\nJust like with any kind of forecasting you need enough sample points (smaller tasks, more team members) and robust sampling (not having each team member work only 1 type of task).\n\nThis article is ridiculously naive and circle jerky. It completely ignores basically the whole point of it, which is to give your team the ability to plan, roadmap, and make informed trade offs. It is not to judge team performance and it certainly is not impossible. I don't know how you come to that conclusion except by not reading anything or thinking critically. Enjoy your round of applause for repeating the same tired claims to an audience that wants to hear the message.\n\nNow, coding with ai tooling has thrown a big wrench in things though.",

Less stress, more clarity. Our estimates were rolled up - so it was more \"red/yellow/green\" vibe than \"Will it be done by X?!?!\" We gave them rough dates, they were content as we showed updates/progress - stake holders had insight into progress, so they were never surprised if there was a delay, or it was done faster.\n\nI miss those days.\n\nUnfortunately, the lab was absorbed into the parent company (it made them look bad - it was moving fast and delivering results, the company was full of old-heads who struggled with change and progress - plus, it was a utility, so they get to make money by being shitty either way)",

I think in an experienced team, it's often possible to have useful accuracy.\n\n\nAs an example, at my last job we had a bunch of services based on a framework. We stood up a new service a couple of times a year, and we very often added a new feature to an existing service that required the same pattern of work: add a new DB column, add some business logic around it, add some new methods to the API. Even if the exact business feature was quite different each time, the time to completion was straightforward to estimate.\n\n\nAnd estimates are really important. They allow sales and marketing to do their jobs. They also give important leverage to the engineering team (\"we said it would take three months, and it'll take three months. Stop pressuring us to get it done in two, it's not happening.\")\n\n\nAs for the engineering team, the process of estimating is important because it quickly reveals the degree of certainty attached to all the key elements. When you are being asked to commit to a date, that's often the point where you really pore through the requirements and realize: hey, there's something here that I don't even know how to do yet. We often have a tendency to rush in and begin with the easy parts, the fun parts, the flashy parts, and ignore the fuzzy, ugly, poorly understood parts. Where I work, project estimation is often the first place one is empowered to tell management that the requirements are unclear and must be fixed. THAT happens all the time where I currently work.",

Separate the estimates and reports: when something will be done and when the information about the progress will be available, and make the reports meaningful. To do this use the experience: how does the report and estimate of copying files look like? Nothing, theoretical calculation, hanging on 99% for an hour, saying which files are already copied, specify the number of copied files regardless of their size, specify the size regardless of number of files, say the copy is complete, but it's actually in the cache and might be lost if the device disconnects - plenty of options to consider. The binary-search-like approach and experience actually helps: specify two points \"I'll complete it in 5 minutes\" and \"I'll complete it in 5 years\", both are not realistic, cut the range in half, see which half is more likely contains the realistic estimate, repeat. Negotiation is not forbidden in the estimates: \"we need to complete A in order to retain the customer, their renewal decision is in one month\", \"what if we give them B in two weeks, but A in two months?\". \n\nSir, this is Wendy's.",

Managers have to break down the scope into small enough modules so the engineers can estimate. Things get rough when there is 0 specification apart from 4 sentences from a client and they refuse to pay for discovery and you are competing against 5 other companies trying to get the project.

Surprise, surprise, once I got the task of overlooking estimates and I managed to point out how most of our devs are overestimating by a large margin, we could actually get projects because I'd correct the estimations. I was curious and got permission to not tell the same devs that the actual budget is much smaller yet they managed to finish work 70% of the time within my estimation.\n\nMost of our devs overestimated for 2 reasons: cookie points from the CEO and to slack off at home when calling in sick and \"work\" from home or being remote.\n\nI love remote and I fought multiple times to keep that offer on the table for anyone at the company, but boy, I fucking hate people who will estimate 40 hours for a simple fucking CRUD only so they can finish it in 4 hours or less with AI, then they can jerk off while we are pricing ourselves out of the market.\n\nEDIT: I'd add that what I described is not for corporate jobs or startups with self developed apps.

Fedora has 6-month release cycle so you won't be bothered by version upgrades too often and it's not shipping some day-old drivers with bugs in them, but it's still modern enough so that all the new hardware and whatnot works perfectly.\n\n[Ultramarine Linux](https://ultramarine-linux.org/) is another great option, it's new like Cachy but it's 99.9% Fedora so you're basically getting the stability and support from Fedora. What Ultramarine does better is that it comes with some important stuff pre-installed for you, such as NVIDIA drivers and proprietary media codecs.",

My final OMG moment was as I simply installed Steam and was ready to tinker with Proton/Wine but nothing. Just Steam-install my Windows games and play without hassle (not all run, but >90%). Even VR runs good. If they rtun they run better than under Win 11. Also AI, ComfyUI, Ollama all run so good.

              "text": "I've been extensively studying and testing distros for the last few months, here's my current take (still just my opinion of course):\n\n* **Ubuntu** (and more so **Kubuntu**) is a solid distro in itself, but its parent company Canonical is basically the Microsoft of Linux. They have implemented some weird quirks into Ubuntu, most recently snaps (while the rest of the Linux world is committed to flatpak), and they are very much pushing their own agenda over the community's good. I just feel like once you switch away from Microsoft, why move to the next worst thing?\n* **PopOS** is a weird one. Their COSMIC desktop environment is theoretically crazy good and I can't wait to use it for real, but it's just not quite there yet. One or two more years and I will definitely try PopOS on my gaming rig, but for now I can't really recommend it due to it being in an awkward mixed state between old and new systems. Their dev team is fully focused on COSMIC, but it's not usable for most people yet.\n* **Fedora** is what I would recommend for most people's everyday use, specifically the [KDE Plasma](https://www.fedoraproject.org/kde/) version. Gaming, programming, creative work... basically for any desktop use. It's very much like Ubuntu for everyday use, but RedHat has been much more Linux friendly and user friendly than Canonical. Similar to Ubuntu, it has a 6-month release cycle for that sweet spot between stable and modern.\n* **Ultramarine Linux** is a promising new distro that's basically 99% Fedora but more beginner friendly. It has less post-installation hassle with things like media codecs and NVIDIA drivers pre-installed for you. Worth looking at, although I *personally* prefer sticking with the base distro (Fedora) whenever possible. But that's probably because I'm already familiar with it, if you're new to Linux then [Ultramarine](https://ultramarine-linux.org/) might be the best option there is right now.",

Haven't you followed the recent news regarding closing the code for RHEL? All distro based on it had to do some workarounds to resolve this, it hurt the open-source ecosystem a lot.\n\nAnd as much as I wanted to love Fedora, it is simply not as good as Ubuntu if you are on NVIDIA. The constant kernel and GPU driver updates requires the system to rebuild their versions against each other, leading to a lot of breakages. While on Ubuntu you rarely face this since the versions of things are just \"up to date enough\", rarely forcing rebuilds, and therefore, less breakages.\n\nUltimately I would recommend Fedora only for those who Are not using NVIDIA, unfortunately for me, it is not the case.

A lot of us are forced to work with Windows at work--have to write websites in C#/ASP.Net and we build our code on Windows too.  But if we have it at home we're using a home (option 2) flavor so we get stuck with all the reminders that we're only licensing the software from Microsoft.  This is why the last time I bought a laptop for home I got Linux preinstalled (via Dell no doubt).

I set up Headscale and RustDesk for easy remote support (I self-host on a $5/mo VPS that also hosts my personal website) and everyone has been super happy. I'm probably the happiest since if one person notices something is off, I can push out fixes to everyone using Ansible. Saves me a bunch of time.\n\nAs always with Linux, there's a little jank. Chrome didn't correctly associate its windows with the KDE tray icon, [so I helped convince the flatpak maintainers](https://github.com/flathub/com.google.Chrome/pull/483) to [merge a PR that would fix it](https://github.com/flathub/com.google.Chrome/pull/474). Similarly, Dropbox didn't detect the home directory correctly and required a manual workaround, [so I opened an issue and PR to get that fixed, too](https://github.com/flathub/com.dropbox.Client/issues/392). The beauty of open source on display.\n\nOf course there's all sorts of other jank I can't fix myself. Questionable interface decisions in KDE. Some AppStreams randomly don't work in Discover (e.g. Dolphin extensions, so no Dropbox sync indicators!). The software development story in containers is not as straightforward as one would hope and CUDA passthrough is still annoying.\n\nThe biggest headache, however, was installing the proprietary Nvidia drivers on my personal computer. There is no way to exaggerate how insane the process is. On a Secure Boot and/or LUKS-encrypted system, it's not enough to layer the akmod-nvidia and xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda packages, oh no. You must also generate a Machine Owner Key, enroll it, and then generate a small rpm package to shim that key into ostree. Then you have to manually configure dracut to load the drivers early enough for the LUKS prompt, which slows down updates by needing to renegerate the initrd. [Here's a guide I found invaluable](https://github.com/Comprehensive-Wall28/Nvidia-Fedora-Guide).\n\nIf you have a Nvidia GPU, I'd suggest looking at the more batteries-included Project Bluefin distros (Bazzite, Aurora, etc.). Take this with a grain of salt since I haven't tried them myself. For Intel or AMD, I'd recommend using vanilla Fedora for its stronger community and more storied history (i.e. I trust it more).\n\nAll that said, none of us miss Windows in the slightest.",

TL;DR: I really enjoy the workflow so far, especially the idea of keeping my toolchains separate from everything else via distrobox. Of course you don't *need* to be on Bazzite/Aurora/Bluefin to use distrobox, but it really fits the theme of the entire OS well.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't know if I'd just blindly recommend it to other devs. I'd say read up on the idea of atomic/immutable distros first, and if it sounds interesting enough then definitely give it a test drive on a separate drive or partition. I don't think it's too big of a change IMO, but you also can't just blindly `dnf install ruby` or whatever like you'd usually do, either.\n\nFor your regular Joe User that just needs the basics though? I can seriously see this being the future. Updates are dead simple and have almost no chance of completely trashing your system. And on the off chance that it *does* break something, rollbacks are a couple of clicks (or one command) away.",

I have to add a non-free repo to my debian system and apt install the nvidia-driver.

That's just the first thing I do now if I run an update and my second monitor isn't working when I reboot, and it always fixes it.\n\n\nI haven't tried my entire steam library yet, but every steam game that I have tried so far just works in Linux, as easily as it would in Windows. A far cry from the Loki Games days where there were 5 or 6 games being manually ported to Linux. I have not ever been able to keep World of Warcraft consistently running on my Linux system.

It won't be able to do everything your main machine can, but you can dip your toes in, see what works for you and what doesn't, before you take the plunge. For things like web browsing, document usage, playing music and videos, everything should just work.\n\n  \n(Full disclosure I was a Suse linux user last century, I once had a sun 'pizza box' as my home computer.

I know you're really just simplifying, but the history of GUIs is way more involved than that, and some other GUI Desktop OSes are still floating about, if niche.\n\nOkay, Amiga in particular ...isn't doing so hot since the 1990s.... and you mightn't want it as your primary desktop now, but there have been *a bunch* of GUI Desktop OSes and GUI toolkits, some quite \nmainstream outside the USA. The USA was a weird black hole of non-Amiga-usage from the European perspective (especially as Amiga was technically an American-origin home/personal computer, though not an IBM-PC-Compatible (much like Classic Mac wasn't). Well confusing things, you could fit an optional x86-on-a-card to an Amiga, that made it also IBM-PC-Compatible)\n\n*This* is not intended to be exhaustive either, just horizon-broadening...\n\nThere are present-day open source AmigaOS clones  https://www.arosworld.org/infusions/weblinks/weblinks.php?cat_id=4\n\nBeOS, a strongly AmigaOS influenced OS, has present-day open source Haiku clone https://www.haiku-os.org/\n\nThere's also RiscOS (originating on the Acorn Archimedes, like the ARM cpu you might have heard of), which runs to this day as an option on Raspberry Pis today, and was open sourced. Probably doing the best out of the euro big three Amiga/ST/Archie, even though the Archie was a distant 3rd in Europe back in the day. https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads\n\nAtari ST TOS/GEM effectively went open too, and while Amiga people looked down on it at the time, actually toward the end became arguably more powerful than AmigaOS in some ways (being e.g. further along in adding memory protection) https://freemint.github.io/\n\nGEOS became New Deal Office / Geoworks became Breadbox. It actually got somewhat open sourced too https://bluewaysw.github.io/pcgeos/ \n\nClassic-MacOS is really a very different OS to OS X (which is really NeXtStep descendant... Unfortunately Apple dropped the X recently, so I've been calling it Step-MacOS when I need to distinguish), though OS X did include a something of a source-compat api GUI layer (carbon).\n\nPsion [tiny-laptop-like PDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_\\(company\\)#/media/File:2005-04-16_Psion_Serie_5mx_PRO_24MB_beschn_unscharf_scharf.JPG) OS EPOC32 eventually became SymbianOS that became very widely used on (mostly non-US) nearly-smart gsm + java mobile devices for ages just before Android/iOS. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian\n\nThe QNX/Neutrino Photon microGUI again saw mostly embedded/mobile device use but QNX is still about today, and Photon was interesting architecturally https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/6.4.1/neutrino/sys_arch/photon.html#GRAPHMICROK.  It's the one that did the \"one floppy disk web browser\" gui desktop with web browser demo back in the day. http://toastytech.com/guis/qnxdemo.html\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8kQzKCn7lE .  At one stage QNX was lined up to be the Amiga-branded successor to AmigaOS proper, but that deal collapsed totally. https://www.osnews.com/story/11034/how-qnx-failed-the-amiga/\n\nAnd then over in Japan they had their own stuff, like the GUI desktop for Sharp X68000s SX-Window on the Human68k OS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SX-Window\n\n\n>  There are easily 15 or 20 different window managers to choose from\n\nYes, it is case that the GUI widget toolkits, window managers / desktop environments and display servers (X11, Wayland) can be somewhat decoupled from the OS overall, though that's most common in Unix/Linux/BSD land... it also can apply somewhat elsewhere e.g. AmigaOS had 3rd party Scalos and Directory Opus and 1st party Workbench Desktop Environments, 1st party Intuition and 3rd party MUI and ClassAct GUI toolkits (until ClassAct became part of the OS later as ReAction), and [VMS/OpenVMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS) also ran X11 CDE while being not really a Unix.  (while VMS isn't popular now, it still exists, and famously Microsoft Windows NT (WNT...) is also suspiciously strongly VMS influenced because Cutler - try going to the next letter in the alphabet...).\n\nLinux and the BSDs / Unixes often run the same display servers and GUI toolkits and are architecturally similar generally.  You thus won't have a hugely different desktop experience from Linux on a FreeBSD or DragonflyBSD given a particular GUI Desktop Environment, but they are different OSes.  But you have KDE  (built with Qt), GNOME ( built with Gtk+), XFCE / Gtk+, Enlightenment (EFL/Elementary), etc. etc.",

We were using the same type and schema for two related things which, up until my most recent ticket, had exactly the same shape. When they suddenly had different requirements the change ended up rippling across way more of the system than intended.\n\nThe approach I’ve outlined for the future is that, when sharing types amongst different usages, it’s essential to determine whether the similarity between the types is a **coincidence** or whether it’s an **invariant**. When it’s an invariant, tight coupling is acceptable. When it’s a coincidence, tight coupling is undesirable. A single snapshot of the system is not usually enough to tell you which of these you are dealing with; these are properties of how systems evolve over time.",

I guess now you have isManager and isAdmin, but is it sensible to have a user which is an admin and *not* a manager?\n\nOr maybe you want to say isCancelled.  Ok.  If things are only ever cancelled or not cancelled, you will not regret this choice.  If you ever allow a thing to become uncanceled as part of a retry state, you will quickly find yourself managing multiple orthogonal fields.\n\nIt's fine say \"keep it simple\" if you are certain that your field exists in exactly two states and that will never, ever chance.\n\nNote that binary methods, which validate if you are in X state or not in X state, are probably fine.  Especially if \"cancelled by user\" and \"cancelled because too many retries\" are multiple states something can be in.\n\nBesides, if you have a state field which only has ACTIVE and CANCELLED, and you never actually go beyond those two states, what exactly do you lose?  A few bytes IF the field is properly packed?  The benefit of simplicity just isn't worth the future cost, IMO.  You don't get that much simplicity, DB field migration is the least fun kind of refactor.\n\nI'm pretty sure you can find \"don't use boolean fields\" articles at *least* twenty years old, for both DB fields and method params, so this is one of those lessons I suspect every generation will learn the hard way.\n\nOf course some, who have jumped from industry to industry, never maintaining their legacy code, will never learn it.",

But sometimes I think in this phase I need broader search windows to learn not just the optimal solution for my problems but also the different tools/methods to solve it. I try to do it without AI sometimes, yes it takes longer to solve but in the process I also learn about other things related to that thing, how it works internally, what were the motivations behind them.

AI can be great when the person wielding it (a) knows what they're doing on their own anyway, and (b) doesn't trust it absolutely.\n\nBut you know, I'm starting to wonder if that latter part is wrong.\n\nMy thinking... which is ongoing to be clear, I'm not stating a solid position here... is basically to ask the question: when was the last time I reviewed the code that my Java compiler spit out?  When was the last time I went in and tweaked what my C compiler spit out?\n\nAre we treating AI like something more than it needs to be, which in a way is a weird compiler?\n\nPut it this way... if I write some Java code, and compile it, and run it, and it does what I expect, do I care one iota what the bytecode looks like?  Nope, and neither does anyone else.  If I write TypeScript code, and it passes all the tests I wrote for it, do I care what the resultant JavaScript looks like?  Nope, and neither does anyone else.\n\nWell, not until something goes wrong, of course, but I digress :)\n\nMaybe we should be thinking of AI more like a compiler, and our PROMPTS are the source code.  Of course, there's an obvious flaw there: a compiler will spit out the same code from the same source every time (barring version changes or anything like that).  That's definitely not true for an AI.\n\nBut I'm starting to wonder it that really matters?  As long as what I got THIS TIME works, does it matter what  I got LAST time?\n\nAnd what about the argument that AI-generated code is technical debt because eventually you're going to have to touch it yourself.\n\nARE you though?\n\nIf you need a new feature later, you just prompt (and prompt again and again and again and...) until you get what you want.  Oh, there's a bug?  Prompt the AI to fix it.  Oh, it's not quite performant enough?  Prompt the AI to optimize.  As long as the tests still pass, what's the difference?\n\nYour prompts are the source code, the AI is your compiler, whether it's a new feature, a bug, or anything else, why do you care what it actually produces if it works and passes the test?\n\nThis viewpoint bothers me a great deal because it may not be wrong.  Believe me, I've been coding in one form or another for right around 47 years now, professionally for a hair over 30.  And I still enjoy it.  So I don't WANT to NOT code.  But it could it be that \"coding\" is starting to have a different meaning?\n\nMaybe.\n\nAI tends to fall flat on its face if there isn't expertise guiding it.  I've seen people use AI poorly because they don't have the skill to even prompt it properly for what is needed.  You can only go so far with these tools without knowledge and experience to guide it properly.  But man, when you have those things, what you can get out of them IS pretty amazing sometimes... the trick is you have to not look under the covers... and maybe that's okay.\n\nLike I said, it's an evolving thought, and I may well discard it upon further reflection.  But it strikes me as an interesting thought regardless.",

In contrast, LLMs are processing informal language -- there is no spec, there are no regression tests for it. If someone made a compiler that has tons of amazing features that would make life so much easier in theory, but is also full of subtle miscompilation bugs where it simply cannot be trusted that it will do what you told it to, then most people today wouldn't use it. Yes, it is a matter of trust, but there are real reasons behind that trust. You could as well say \"the only difference between actually solving an equation and rolling the dice is trust\".

Claude can tell me very convincingly that I'm on the right path, it can code a solution, it can make something that works, and at the same time it can be architecturally absolutely the wrong thing to do. I think the process described in this article - where you start off impressed, gradually build out a project, and end up in a total mess - is absolutely spot on.\n\nI could decide, like this guy, to not use AI at all, but there's no question I would be slower in certain tasks. But for every task I delegate to it, I'm not really learning (though again, I can't really be dogmatic here because I *do* learn stuff from Claude) and I don't really get to know the system that I'm creating. At work I'm writing in a C++ codebase; I hardly know C++, so AI has written a load of my code. Lo and behold, I shipped a catastrophic C++ bug to production last week (call me names, this is not just my reality; many engineers are doing the same thing). I would *love* for AI to not exist, because then I could really work to become an expert in C++, and it would be understood that this will take time. But because of AI, the assumption is I don't have to do this learning, because an agent can already write the code. So I feel pressured to use AI, even though using it is making me a worse engineer. \n\nIn a way, I think giving up on it entirely is both admirable and sensible. But I worry that if models improve, I'll just end up doing nothing more than raging against the (word-making) machine while others profit from it...",

We're pretty used to minority coalitions with some support deal in parliament; we haven't had a single party have majority nationally in this millennium. Party membership has been on the decline for a while, but it's still fairly normal to work with someone who's a member of some political party. Which is to say: Political affiliations are protected information (your employer can't make you disclose it), but discussions aren't taboo, and it's pretty expected that people have varying opinions, rather than having to lump everyone into team red vs team blue.\n* We have pretty strong labour rights and unions, and are pretty habituated to the [tripartite cooperation](https://snl.no/trepartssamarbeid) of labour unions, employer unions and the government.\n* We like to think we have a pretty flat hierarchy, where it's expected that you're able to contradict and argue with your boss in meetings.\n* (We also don't really have words like \"sir\" or \"madam\" in our language any more; those fell out of use, oh, around a century ago?)\n\nSo for us I'd kind of expect a labour union like [Tekna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekna_(Norway\\)) or [NITO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Society_of_Engineers_and_Technologists) to be involved in having the backs of employees, but also in informing employees in what's expected to be acceptable and what's not.\n\nThat doesn't mean that everything is sunshine and butterflies, but we might be a bit more predisposed to the idea that employees can and will push back on the stuff their employers want.\n\n> The real question the paper doesn't answer: who's going to pay for quality information if not advertisers?\n\nAt least here in Norway I'd expect tax money to  be a part of the discussion, in a way that'd probably be … somewhat contentious over in Silicon Valley.

I don't know what you really mean when you say \"democratic\" here. On one hand, you might be referring to \"software being for everyone\", but then you are perhaps unwittingly mixing in related concepts that are unrelated to software. What makes something \"unethical software\", exactly? It reads to be very vague and arbitrarily, unfortunately, without specific definitions of what you actually mean.\n\nAnd talking about specifics, I think the only unethical stuff in relation to open-source software is proprietary software, pseudo-open source (think shared source where you can see the code, but aren't allowed to do anything with it), and LLM-generated slop that is currently inundating open source project merge request and issue boards ~ slop that might have been derived from LLMs training on proprietary code, for one.",

They cost a few hundred dollars (back in the day) per seat and were highly profitable. Software companies made money off of other companies' software development. (personally, I bought Turbo C++ for $150 in 1992)\n\nOpen source changed that and most software development tools don't generate revenue (yes, Visual Studio, Oracle's Java, and embedded tools still cost money, but they're the outliers). Sure, I'll pay for a library every now and then, but I always have the choice not to.\n\nNow, imagine the case where you took something that cost everyone nothing but their time and found a way to charge them every time they did it. Not just for the tools or hardware, but every single action generated revenue for you, whether or not it saved them any time or effort. \n\nIt's like if Fender decided to charge me per note I played while offering suggestions for the next riff. Useful for ideation? Probably. Something that should be baked into how I play guitar or I risk getting kicked out of the band? Definitely not.\n\nOr if Intel decided to rent me cycles on their CPUs rather than let me own them... ;)\n\nAI autocomplete and code generation in general is currently a hell of a drug. The first hits are free but there's a possible future where you won't be able to write a line of code without paying an AI tax on it. Do we want that future?",

Those are immediately stress-tested, researched, expanded, and clarified by the agent.\n\nActing as the driver has made me a better planner, engineer, and communicator. I still reject ideas when they are wrong, but that critical evaluation is now formalized in the updated plan instead of in my head. The result so far is work that is better thought out, better implemented, and significantly easier to explain to others. Overall, it’s leading to sturdier designs and fewer downstream corrections. So far anyway!\n\nI am still very cautious and I don’t give it full access by any means. Everything is still vetted by my eyes, and I always make sure to understand every concept it builds.

What's the issue?\" The bigger the company the more efficiently and perversely it will optimise for max Y in unintended ways.  \n  \nThe example that always sticks with me is London in the early 2000s, when the government was under pressure to reduce the abysmal lengths of time people were waiting in A&E (ER) before being triaged/seen by doctors. So they introduced a target: hospitals would be rewarded based on the proportion of people arriving at A&E who were seen, treated and discharged within a four-hour window. The aim being more efficient hospitals and better public opinion. A couple of ways in which hospitals made progress towards the goal that are arguably unintended: \n\n* Cancelling non-urgent operations so that extra staff could work in A&E when performance was being measured (increasing waiting times for elective surgery across the board).\n* Keeping patients just outside A&E in ambulances so that they didn't technically \"arrive\" until the hospital was confident that they could meet the target (leading to increased ambulance response times).\n* A near doubling of the number of patients who happened to be discharged from the hospital within the last 20 minutes of the window.

The metric in that case was the amount of time between when an order was finalized - ie when the cashier collected the money - and when it was cleared off the order screen.

One classic case is parking norms scaled to handle black friday parking, which means that even on the one most bonkers day of the year there's still capacity _in the parking lot_ (what goes on inside the store is someone else's problem), and the remaining 364 days of the year, the parking lot is grossly oversized and underutilised, and in some cases the parking lot winds up being so big that people spend more time walking between their car and the store than people do between their home and the shop in a walkable urban neighbourhood.\n\nOr scaling highways to be able to deal with holiday traffic, which then either leads to them being oversized the rest of the year, or induced demand, which eats away the gains (and a lot of other stuff).\n\nAt least in software there's _some_ awareness around setting goals for stuff like p50, p90 and so on, and that wanting too many nines comes with its own costs.",

Sometimes those comments are straight up \"this doesn't even work at all\". Though the most useful comments are the ones that catch subtle issues that might cause a problem that may evade detection until the change hits prod.\n\nSome people seem to treat code review as if you just skim the code for blatant badness, rather than genuinely understand the code. As well, sometimes people seem to only review the code in the literal sense of the changes only, without considering the big picture implications of how it interacts with the rest of the system. For example, I have some areas of my codebase that must be reentrant (as the code must be able to resume when it gets interrupted), yet it's common for authors to write code that is not reentrant and for reviewers to fail to consider it.\n\nOf course, ideally code would have as few gotchas as possible, have CI systems to ensure it's safe, etc, but it's impossible/infeasible to cover everything, so human reviewers need to be good.",

Unlike mermaid, you can choose the layout of the diagram. (mermaid gets kinda ugly sometimes, at least the flow charts do.)\n\nIt runs in the browser, so it's universally accessible from all devices (not sure about mobile usability TBH).\n\nIt can export an image, so it can be used in documentation.\n\nIt can export as SVG, which means you can have links and other rich metadata in your diagram.\n\nAnd the real killer feature that makes me pick it as my favorite is that you can embed the draw.io metadata _in the image itself_, so you can import the PNG or SVG back into draw.io for further editing.\n\nSimply an amazing tool. I'm honestly surprised it's not mentioned here.\n\nMermaid is better for some things though, e.g. sequence diagrams.",

If I have to explain the entire problem in detail I’m already 90% of the way to solution. \n\nThis becomes especially apparent when you have a large and complex codebase. I was lazy today and asked Gemini to solve some android unit test problems and it was painfully bad at doing so, even with pretty specific prompting and direction. I hate writing fixing tests, but doing it myself ended up being less of a pain than getting a ton of hallucinated solutions.\n\nIt’s great for boilerplate and I genuinely appreciate the AI code review a lot because it makes it easy to fix common mistakes you miss. And it’s surprisingly handy for math and DSA type problems or simplifying code that works but isn’t easy to read or is too verbose.\n\nBeyond that though it’s… not super useful if you have a large or otherwise custom codebase. The context it’s using to understand your code just has no handle on the complexity, and the time it takes to prompt it is equal or greater than the time it takes to just write the damn thing, and provides none of the satisfaction of finding a solution yourself. \n\nMy most enjoyable moments AI coding have been using it as a sounding board for ideas to rapidly iterate potential solutions, but vibe coding isn’t gonna do it for any enterprise size project\n\nEdit: I posted this and realize it was way more reply than necessary, probably because I tried really hard to prompt the thing well today and when I got less lazy I found solutions way more quickly. I think adapting to using it as a junior dev sounding board/algorithm quick thinker is the best idea, but it’s not gonna replace true competent devs",

Its final form is what I expect from a product manager with a BA who took a single \"SWE for non-SWEs\" course at university (Yea, those exist. I had a friend teach one while he was getting his PhD in CS).\n\nWhat I find it useful for is digging through obfuscated legacy code. I'm dyslexic, so \"other people's code is\" a uniquely different \"hell\" for me. I've got my hands on various requirements docs at work, and virtually all of them assume deep in-house / in-program knowledge that takes outsiders (like myself) way too long to tease apart. For example, I'd slap a nun for a semi-complete network topology diagram so I know what IPv4 addresses to connect with; instead, I have half a dozen \"draft\" interface spec documents with holes bigger than the gaps between galactic clusters. I'm somewhat skilled at what I call \"Software Archeology\", and typically get thrown at situations like what I described when there are no more subject matter experts left to consult with. So, using LLMs judiciously, I've turned my discovery cycle from a 2-4wk exercise to a 1wk exercise where I learn enough to ask really hard pointed questions, and another week to motivate folks to update their specs while I work on the other end of the interface.",

If that software is of low quality, the outcome *eventually* may be very bad.\n\n\nMaintainability matters.\n\n\nEven decades ago you'd have startups \"vibe-code\" (via juniors, or outsourcing, no idea — I wish I could find those people, look them in the eye and ask one question: \"WTF?\") the features with the intent to secure funding and then redo it properly. Because who cares how good it is inside if nobody uses it. Once we have customers, it will make sense to invest in quality.\n\n\nThen the project gets serious customers who pay good money and guess what, they constantly request new features and you can't do it! Nobody understands the code, it's dangerous to touch stuff because you don't know what could break in another part of the system, etc. So on one hand you continue adding features in a sloppy manner, further increasing the tech debt, and on the other hand you're extremely conservative in terms of refactoring, afraid to touch something that works. And it never ends.\n\n\nYou may even initiate a \"v2\" project which will consume a lot of resources and get eventually scrapped.\n\n\nThen the language in which the product is written (or its version, or some components, or something else) stops being maintained. No security updates any more. No new developers who'd know it. You can't rewrite anything gradually. You can't replace anything. You can't fix it. You can't find new devs or you have to pay them waaaay more than average to deal with this crap. The product earns a lot of money but its maintenance cost is increasing, eventually surpassing the income.\n\n\nAnd behold, you've locked yourself in a problem you created because at some point the elegance didn't matter.\n\n\n\nThis is not to say that the opposite is preferable, elegance indeed doesn't matter in vacuum, but it's dangerous to sacrifice it.\n\n\n(Edit: typo)",

Which sounds like what the person in the post was trying to do.\n\nHowever, as long as you have a little integration and direction it's been okay at following directions. Today I needed a new feature. It wasn't complicated. I wrote a small technical spec. What it does. How I want it done. Where to put it. And what other features to look to for patterns.\n\nFollowed the 80/20 rule pretty closely. First draft was probably 80% accurate. But that also means I spent 80% of my time getting that last 20% done.\n\nWhen I first started at this place we had access to Github Copilot. It was trash. Then I started using the one built in to JetBrains products. Where it has context and quick access to the whole project. Totally different experience.\n\nAs you said - it's a tool.

A common issue is \"death by a thousand cuts\" - a bunch of *small* inefficiencies add up and are almost impossible to profile as they just appear as noise.\n2. When you have tasks indirectly dependant on other tasks, it can be very unclear where optimizations actually can help. I have a sprite resampling mod for a game. The hashing algorithm is pretty quick, but speeding it up even more still helps the game's render thread keep going, but it also helps keep data getting pushed to the worker threads so that they actually have things to do. A marginal improvement in performance results in a lot of tasks getting done sooner and reduces latency.\n\nAlso noting that measuring (except if you're using very specific tools) won't always tell you what's *actually* causing the slowdown, only what's being slow. Aside from the macro cases of awaiting something else (like IO), this applies to things like cache invalidations (usually due to false sharing or not using non-temporal access where appropriate). The thing *causing* the slowdown is hidden in the profile - what it's made slow is what pops up.",

                  "text": "I completely agree! Measuring implies deciding on a metric, but what metric should one use? Mean, average, the fastest time or something else? Depending on what you want to actually use the measurements for, different metrics offer different benefits. I wrote about that [here](https://modulovalue.com/blog/statistical-methods-for-reliable-benchmarks/#different-metrics-for-different-questions): \n\n* **Fastest (minimum)**: \"How fast can this code run?\" An existence proof of capability. Best for comparing pure algorithms where you want to isolate the code from system noise.\n* **Median**: \"How fast does this code typically run?\" Robust against outliers. Best for understanding typical performance under normal conditions.\n* **Mean (average)**: \"What is the total time cost?\" Essential for capacity planning and throughput calculations where every millisecond counts toward the total.\n\nThere's also the question of which tools one should use. I used standard file IO library that Dart comes with, but I also tried reimplementing it via FFI and It was only a few percent faster so that was a waste of time. One person linked to a blogpost about [Off-CPU Flame Graphs](https://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/offcpuflamegraphs.html) and I think it would be nice to have better tooling in those areas that make it easier to collect data that we can then derive metrics from.",

              "text": "I think that's a fair critique of the title. You're right that \"I/O\" is imprecise here. The bottleneck was really per-file overhead: the accumulated cost of 300,000+ syscalls, filesystem metadata lookups, inode resolution, and directory traversal. The SSD itself was capable of 5-7 GB/s but I was getting 80 MB/s, not because the storage was slow, but because of everything that happens between \"read this file\" and actually getting the bytes.\n\nOne of the commenters (ori\\_b) made a similar point: the user/kernel context switch itself is maybe 50ns on modern hardware, so 300,000 switches only account for about 2% of the 14.5 seconds. The rest is the work happening inside each syscall: filesystem metadata lookups, dentry resolution, random access latency on NVMe (\\~50-100us per read). So \"syscall overhead\" is also slightly misleading. \"Per-file overhead\" is probably the most accurate framing.\n\nI updated the post with an addendum covering this distinction, but you're right that the title could do a better job. The core finding is that going from 104,000 individual file opens to 1,351 archive reads eliminated most of that per-file overhead, giving a 43x I/O improvement. Whether you call that \"I/O\" or \"the boundary between user and kernel space\" or \"per-file overhead\" is partly semantic, but precision matters and the title is sloppy about it.",

          "text": "Let me start negative, then offer an olive branch..\n\nIf you're writing enough specifications to get exactly what you want out of an AI tool, then you're probably close to writing the same amount of text as you'd write for code.\n\nIf you're not writing enough specifications to get exactly what you want, then you're letting a statistical probability engine guess for you what you want. Which means you're basically playing a slot machine and hoping to win more than you lose.\n\nThen there's all the other downsides. Like the fact that the more you start to rely on the AI rather than doing anything for yourself, or thinking, or learning how a function works, or learning an API, the more negative it is for you personally in the long run and for your career, as you're stalling your personal skill development for one off speed boosts. And for the benefit of who? Not you clearly, the benefit is for your employer. They get slop faster, faster updates, and what do you get? You make yourself more easily replaceable in the future because it's not you that has the skill any more, it's the tool that's bringing the value to work. If all you know how to do is just prompt an agent, anyone else can do that too.\n\nNow.. (this is the olive branch part)\n\n.. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that all the AI tools are useless. Sure if you need a quick function or python script to 'do X' where X is a pretty clearly defined thing, and it's something you already know how to do, then yes it's quicker to prompt 'write a RGB to HSL convert function' than it is to actually write the function.\n\nIt's great if you need to do a bunch of simple text edits that follow an explainable pattern and it's quicker to prompt than to type. It's fantastic for boilerplate, or the initial setup of a project if you can describe the structure you want and it generates it, etc. It's like having an infinite library of templates you can describe and fetch, then modify to fit your needs.\n\nIt's WONDERFUL as a learning tool, to explain functions, write a quick explainer on how to use an API, a quick 101 on a new language, etc.\n\nSo there's positives here, it's not all negative.\n\nBut put all this together and what do we get?\n\nWhile cool, the AI coding hype is not even approaching, let alone entering into the same realm as 'Your grandma will be generating her own smart phone apps by 2027' hype level that the AI bros have been pushing on us.\n\nThe bottleneck in software development was NEVER an individual's typing speed anyway. Most of us can type at 100wpm and if you know your language/tools/APIs, it's quite possible to hit those speeds while you're in the process of writing code with a plan and know what you're doing. Hell on the days when I know exactly what I'm doing, I know my language well, my APIs well, and have an exact plan for what I'm doing, I've been able to write insane amounts of code on a daily basis. Or even faster when you look at the crazy hotkey and marco setups some people have on their IDEs, or the autocomplete tools we already had before LLMs. Or just the old tricks of copy/pasting boilerplates, inserting template-able snippets with typed shorthand, etc.\n\nPeople boast about writing 10k lines of code in a day with an agent? I've written 10k lines of code in a day! If I really got a plan worked out and know exactly what I'm doing, I become the code producing version of a GAU-8 Avenger. \n\nThe bottleneck isn't typing speed, if anything more speed can be a bad thing if you're producing code so fast that you're not stopping to think about structure, you're not reviewing anything, and you have no idea even what's in the code or how it works. We don't just make and serve a piece of software like a cake, it's something that requires maintenance and to be evolved over time, to be documented.\n\nNo the real bottle neck with software development is problem solving, planning, designing. The bottleneck is our mental capacity, ability to coordinate with other people, long term structural planning and these tools don't make us better at any of that. If anything they risk making us worse if we over use them.",

Now I can play around with a prototype (that we will throw away) and learn what features are useful and what feels extraneous and I can learn where my specs are unclear or produced results that are different than I hoped. I can get all this done on airplane wifi without having to bother a UX designer or an engineer. I can show that clickable prototype to a customer and get feedback without building anything.\n\nAnother example: I was testing the quality of data that comes from a set of competing vendor’s APIs. I wanted to know where the data overlapped, where it differed and who had the best results for my sample set. I vibe coded a python script that lets me plug in multiple vendor’s APIs and a sample set and it generates a CSV that I can drop into Excel to dig deep into how the data from various vendors compared. It let me spot that 2 of the 5 vendors I was comparing were a strict subset of another vendor and added no value. I ended up settling on two vendors that’s combined data set ended up being super comprehensive and additive. Now I ask engineering to integrate with those two vendors. If I handed this off to engineering, there would’ve been a two week spike to write the integration, two weeks of combing through the data, asking for us to consider adding a 5th vendor and test again. Instead I did this in three hours between meetings. I’m throwing all the code away, but it saved weeks of effort spread across multiple teams.",

It's 3D TV. It's Google Glass. It's trying to sell a future that isn't there yet, and due to the inherent flaws in the tech itself, probably won't be ready for a very long time.\n\nFor companies like Amazon and Google, admitting fault is a very bad thing because it ultimately tells shareholders that they've shitcanned tens of thousands of employees and blown hundreds of billions on tech that's not ready. The challenge for these companies is always misdirection. Much like Meta, they need a new shiny thing to take over to show that they're still market leaders. Failure to do so will likely begin questions on whether the CEO's in charge are the right people for the job - and in the cases of Amazon and Google there are already many questions being asked to that degree.",

HR started complaining that we might have to migrate out or have another server instance and move some employees to a different entity... etc.. \n\nand for shit sake.. I decided to RDP in and have a look, while calling the support team. The server barely had ram or cpu load. ram was like less than 14GB and cpu was mostly 1-2% usage. \n\nIn processes list, they were running SQL express. I asked the support tech why sql express and if they are aware it's limited to 1GB of ram.. apparently that's why they picked it. Because it wouldn't use more than 1 GB of ram. \n\nfuck it.. let's see what's SQL is doing .. turns out it was mostly executing a stored procedure... pull it up.. \n\nFUCK.. it was a mega store procedure.. no it was the entire business logic store procedure. \n\na 1200+ line store procedure that was mostly pulling data into variables and \"If/else\" all inside a single transaction/commit. along with old code commented out. \n\n  \nI closed it.

Those play into it as well of course, but I feel obvious and readable code is maintainable no matter who wrote it.\n\nIt also doesn't seem much different whether I have to dive in an understand code to debug an issue, to find a cause, to understand behavior, to add, or to remove something.\n\nWhen I work, most analyses of existing and legacy code I have not touched yet lead to numerous code changes during analysis. It helps me understand and follow things. And in the end, I can extract the minimal needed change, but also either first or follow up with code improvements for maintainability and documentation updates (which usually also happens during analysis/exploration).\n\nAn opportunity for removal comes naturally in that process.

We own them, but no urgent development is needed for them.\n\nTo keep things fresh, it’s multiple services running on top of  micro size instances of managed postgres in AWS. AWS has this nice feature where you can buffer disk I/O credits and cpu credits from when you need them, so can have the occasional heavy query still getting executed fairly fast. \n\nOn top of that they have made a bunch of terrible database crimes that cause full table scans all the time. As long as the tables are small enough, they stay cached in ram, queries are still fast enough and everything looks fine. \n\nOnce those table grow big enough though, each query causes part of the table to get evicted from ram, causing a bit of I/O on disk. \n\nInitially it just uses part of the buffer during office hours and then the buffer refills. \n\nThen people working late start getting timeouts because the buffer is empty. After they stop working for a bit, and report it is down, it starts responding again.\n\nThen things start timing out during the late afternoon working hours, but redeploying things helps. And when you check things out in the morning, everything runs fine.\n\nBefore x-mas we took a closer look at one of the services, and found a routine that look for things added in the last 5 mins, but the timestamp column doesn’t have an index on it, so it needs to scan the entire log table.\n\nThis week another of these services started doing the same thing, so we immediately looked at the database. The entire service consists of storing ‘items’ with their ‘itemlines’.\n\nBrainiac A decided that a many-to-many relation was the right implementation for this. \n\nBrainiac B decided that when you need to lookup all itemslines by item id, the correct way was to go though all the item lines, join them to the item-to-itemlines table, and then filter out any itemlines where the item id on the item-to-itemlines entity didn’t match the item id you are looking for. There is a covering index on the item-to-itemline table that would solve this with a lookup, but they managed to write the C# code in a way that ensured that EF didn’t use it by accident.",

Also if that causes such extreme performance issues then I'd argue something else is wrong as well. Don't get me wrong, waiting for every single row to be updated in a loop is very bad, but on any reasonable system with any reasonable operation that should still complete fast enough that people don't give up.\n\nHow many users are they updating in that loop that it takes 5+ minutes? How long is the wait for each update? I'd expect waiting for a single update on any reasonable configuration to take like at most 2ms or something of that order, or say 500 updates per second. Not great, but it'd work. Even if we'd assume much worse performance at 50 updates per second, why would that take 5+ minutes? Do they really need to update 50 x 5 x 60 = 15,000 users? Or is there any reason a simple user update takes about 20ms?\n\nGiven that the bulk operation completed in 300ms I'd say there's probably something else going on that slowed the updates in that loop and that the loop was just the place where it had the biggest visible impact",
