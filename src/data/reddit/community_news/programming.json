The guy had about 25 years of experience, so I e-mailed him back and said that I would definitely consider him but that I was trying to hire some junior guys first to balance out the team.\n\nThat afternoon I was pulled into a meeting with the VP of Engineering who told me to stop interviewing for juniors.  \"That's what outsourcing is for,\" he said.  I pointed out that if we don't hire juniors, they won't develop into seniors, and then what do we do in a few years when we start looking for seniors and there aren't any.

Then, when you get feature requests, maintenance, observability, shifting business directions and the like, you will realize that the code actually had bad abstractions, and even those bad abstractions were not fully followed and have leaked all over. You will have multiple places accessing S3 using the FileProcessor and the FileDownloader and the PdfGetter and, to add insult to injury, raw AWS API calls sprinkled in various places. Also, you should worry about security very hard because most LLMs don't give a fuck. I also take offense at you downplaying the added maintenance costs from this.

We were treated as professionals in training.\n\nMy first task was a “benign” display bug. I was given time to explore so I could learn the system. In doing that, I found a deeper logic error affecting calculations. It was dismissed at first, then confirmed. That catch mattered because someone invested in letting a junior care and look closely.\n\nThat’s what I worry about losing, not typing speed. I don’t need juniors who grind out code that now can be generated. I need juniors who care about correctness, continuity, and the company surviving long enough to pay them.\n\nAI is just another tool. It can accelerate work. It can’t replace ownership.\n\nTo me the question is how do we preserve that sense of responsibility while tooling risks reducing the bench of skilled developers who can care.\n\nEven if your code can be generated and supported with minimal effort, at some point you will be on vacation when a critical change is needed. Or you may move on to new responsibilities or simply no longer be part of the company. Someone unfamiliar with the code regenerating it whole or trying to tweak it may be inefficient and ineffective. *That* is when the price of not having a bench of junior engineers will be realized.",

Unless you move on to a management position (and sometimes not even then) you don't ever pass coding off to a \"code monkey\". \n\nWriting docs is good, you want a person who starts a task to have everything they need to get going, and more often than not can someone with long company experience contribute such knowledge. Preferably this is added as soon as possible, but that is not a blocker for starting the work, the assigneed will just have to do information gathering first.",

But a constriction in the job market for them is still significant news. Especially as it affects the downstream promotion to senior engineers a decade down the line.\n\nIf you hire 100k junior developers in 2010, maybe 25k of them will be senior by 2020 (totally arbitrary numbers to demonstrate a wider point). \n\nIf suddenly AI cuts that demand by even just 25%, that's a massive reduction in talent in the long run. That's the problem. Couple this with the fact that our largest demographic is currently in the process of retiring, it means the talent pool is getting squeezed from both ends, and talented senior software developers are going to get rarer and rarer, there is probably some maths you can do to work out the precise date in which they hit maximum rareness, given what we know about retirement rates, and layoff rates. \n\nMaybe give it a few years, and we're probably not going to see the number of senior software engineers notably increase again. That's it. The growth in this market has capped (at least in the west). Unless big tech is expecting AI to also fill the senior engineer gap, the number of humans doing this job is likely at its limit. This is a classic pipeline problem. Companies are saving money on hiring juniors now, and expecting seniors to just \"be there\" in the future, or perhaps not even thinking about it and they're totally short-sighted which really wouldn't surprise me.",

Huge amounts of actual code & comments in, lossily compressed into a neural whatever network (the model), then spit back out on request. There are quite a few documented cases of the AI spitting out the _exact same code_ as some repository somewhere.

This often leads to fewer bugs, including security bugs.\n\nMeanwhile, the only distinct advantage closed source has is security through obscurity, which is not much help even in the best of times.",

If the string contents are not mutated and length is rarely needed, such as when parsing, a single pointer into the string beats either base+offset with a length field stored somewhere, or position+remaining length. Having a current and end pointer works well, though; neither complex indexing nor needing to decrement the length for every increment in position. In files and network traffic, nul-termination has the advantage that you don't need to know the length before you begin writing.\n\nReally depends what operations you'll be doing most: Copying/concatinating the string contents with little care for the specific text within, or parsing the contents without needing to touch string as a whole.\n\nBut storing the length separately probably makes for a better default. Those who have a specific reason to opt for a non-default structure hopefully know what they're doing and can take the requisite care to avoid problems.",

This means that, roughly from version 3.6.0, any publicly-accessible MongoDB instance has been vulnerable to this.\n\nIt is unknown whether the exploit was known and exploited by actors prior to its disclosure. Given the simplicity of it, I bet it was.\n\nAs of the exploit’s disclosure, which happened on 19th of December, it has been a race to patch the database.\n\nSifting through Git history, it seems like the fix was initially committed on the 17th of December. It was merged a full 5 days after in the public repo - on the 22nd of December (1-line fix btw).\n\nThat beig said, MongoDB 8.0.17 containing the fix was released on Dec 19, consistent with the CVE publish data. While public JIRA activity shows that patches went out on the 22nd of December, I understand that Mongo develops in a private repository and only later syncs to the public one.\n\nIn any case - because there’s no official timeline posted, members of the community like me have to guess. As of writing, 10 days later in Dec 28, 2025, Mongo have still NOT properly addressed the issue publicly.\n\nThey only issued a community disclosure of the CVE a full five days after the publication of it. It is then, on the 24th of December, that they announced that all of their database instances in their cloud service Atlas were fully patched. Reading through online anecdotes, it seems like the service was patched days before the CVE was published. (e.g on the 18th)\n\nMongo says that they haven’t verified exploitation so far:\n\n“at this time, we have no evidence that this issue has been exploited or that any customer data has been compromised”",

Microsoft made the case for Rust eons ago when they mentioned that [70% of the vulnerabilities in relevant code were memory-safety issues that Rust eliminates by design][microsoft-rust], and these numbers were [corroborated at the time by Mozilla][mozilla-rust] which Microsoft also cites, and as late as last year (2025 for those not paying attention), Google published a [detail statistical analysis of their own internal experience with Rust][google-rust]. Of course this number is significantly reduced in general terms, however that can easily be explained by the fact that most code isn't even written in any of the 3 languages mentioned in the article, so in the context where C++ is used, memory safety is still a huge deal, and of the 3 languages mentioned in the article, only Rust tackles it head-on.\n\n> Second, for the subset that is about programming language insecurity, the problem child is C, not C++.\n\nThe author sources their claims, but their source also states the following about the findings:\n\n> For starters, more code has been written than any other language, providing more opportunities for vulnerabilities to be discovered. The fact is that C has been in use for much longer than most other languages, and is behind the core of most of the products and platforms we use. As such, it is bound to have more known vulnerabilities than the rest.\n\nSo the source explicitly does not back the point that the author is trying to make, Rust isn't even there since most of the timespan analyzed by the source predates Rust 1.0, and C++26 isn't even part of the equation for obvious reasons.\n\n[microsoft-rust]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2019/07/why-rust-for-safe-systems-programming\n[mozilla-rust]: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/02/rewriting-a-browser-component-in-rust/\n[google-rust]: https://security.googleblog.com/2025/11/rust-in-android-move-fast-fix-things.html",

RAII is pre-C++11 and shared_ptr existed in Boost pre-C++11.\n\nAlso, many of the complaints I saw about the language have already been fixed or have warnings in compilers, which you can nad should set as errors. \n\nFor example, returning a pointer from a local from the stack is in theory allowed, but compilers will not let you do it. This can be applied to narrowing conversions and a ton of things, increasing safety and correctness (namely, compilers are better and safer than the ISO standard strictly speaking).\n\n Even to a subset of lifetime analysis (this one is still quite worse than Rust, but dẻtcts many cases). All this, paired with value-oriented programming and smart pointers makes C++ a language that is quite safe. C++26 includes standard library hardening as well... Value semantics eliminate a lot of the need for lifetime handling.\n\nC++ in the average case does not have a big problem with safety. It does need improvements standard-wise but it is not that unsafe when used with a few patterns that are not that difficult to remember.\n\nIt does have a few footguns though with string_view and others and you have to be conservative about how you use that or capture in lambdas that will be invoked in another scope. In this area Rust did a good job though I think a full borrow checker imposes too much rigidity.",

He doesn't understand the difference between the two and there was no senior developer around to explain it to him.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/programmingcirclejerk/comments/1q1ucjf/he_could_not_imagine_working_in_language_without/\n\nAnd it also says that it took them a year to develop slices. I mean, slices in go probably have the worst API. I don't know of any other programming language where they would test a person's ability to use slices during interviews. It's not about the internals, it's about the fact that they couldn't make a `push` that would just work.\n\n> You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the bad programing languages design, not join them! Bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness!\n\nI am very sorry because we could have gotten a programming language that would have solved many problems and instead we got one more language with a bad design like js or php. These languages ​​were developed a long time ago. js was created in about 10 days with the aim of making an animation play when hovering over a cursor on a picture. php was created to create an incremental counter. In a way, this justifies their bad design. There is no excuse for go which was launched in 2012.",

Though for those that are older than Go there are likely several tools to choose from, like Python moving from `black` to `ruff`, and/or several styles, like in [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibFormat.html).",

The bad thing is that `gofmt` has the weirdest opinions on code formatting, like using tabs everywhere with a default of 8 for the tabStop.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I've ever seen a professional codebase that uses tabs, and 8 spaces as indentation. 4 spaces is common, so is 2. 8 spaces forces you to have short variable names and limit yourself to 3 indentation levels maximum (i.e. an if in a loop in a function, not more) which already takes up 30% of the screen (if you're limiting yourself to 80 chars). Then there's the weird spacing choices around operators in an expression.\n\nIt's still better than in a lot of other languages (looking at you Python) in which there are 10 tools to do the same with no consistency. At least gofmt is the one true tool for formatting go code.",

No \"make illegal states unrepresentable\" there.\n\nSo some \"can I do this?\" questions wind up with either needing to check some docstrings in the kubernetes API reference, or just sending it to a server and seeing if it rejects it. At least schema validators like `kubeconform` help.\n\nIt also bugs me that since Go is the ur-language for Kubernetes, the API in other languages winds up being just recreations of that, rather than actually utilising language features that would make it more ergonomic and correctness-enforcing.",

He helped with Unix and created grep, regular expressions and UTF-8.\n\nTo a large extent, in creating Go, they came a long way toward re-creating Pascal, and essentially have admitted Pascal was a better language than C all along. Of course, they still prefer their C-like syntax.\n\nAs for C++, Ada always was and still is a better language.\n\nAs for Rust, Ada Spark could teach it some things.\n\nAt least we're starting to make some progress toward safer programming languages becoming mainstream. It's too bad we spent the last 50 years writing unsafe C and C++ code, which we will be stuck with for decades longer, when we could have been writing safe Pascal and Ada code and that might have meant Ada would be even better today than it already is. C and C++, and other unsafe languages, will now become dinosaur code like COBOL.",

This text file has no particular legal or technical authority, and it’s not even particularly complicated. It represents a handshake deal between some of the earliest pioneers of the internet to respect each other’s wishes and build the internet in a way that benefitted everybody. It’s a mini constitution for the internet, written in code.\n\nIt’s called robots.txt and is usually located at yourwebsite.com/robots.txt. That file allows anyone who runs a website — big or small, cooking blog or multinational corporation — to tell the web who’s allowed in and who isn’t. Which search engines can index your site? What archival projects can grab a version of your page and save it? Can competitors keep tabs on your pages for their own files? You get to decide and declare that to the web.\n\nIt’s not a perfect system, but it works. Used to, anyway. For decades, the main focus of robots.txt was on search engines; you’d let them scrape your site and in exchange they’d promise to send people back to you. Now AI has changed the equation: companies around the web are using your site and its data to build massive sets of training data, in order to build models and products that may not acknowledge your existence at all.\n\nWe made this article free to read for the rest of the day: https://www.theverge.com/24067997/robots-txt-ai-text-file-web-crawlers-spiders",

I used robots.txt to ban Googlebot from the problem page, and banned the two AI bots entirely. All three respected the change (eventually; they only checked robots.txt every half hour or so).",

But if I deliver a rock solid solution that is nearly 100% reliable and required next to zero maintenance, we all win.  The business gets what it wants, my example will be replicated by similar solutions down the road, and those who are on-call will appreciate the low overhead to keep things running.",

It's fundamentally an implementation of the memoryless exponential decay function. Stochastically speaking, for every extra dollar earned, you roll the die. The odds stay the same, and to survive 1 Billion roles becomes extremely rare, not impossible, but rare. A handful of people become rich, while the majority 97% won't go past the 80K income barrier. In other words, the billionaire income bracket can only exist, because 97% of the population stays ultimately poor (without property). Once you are in that region, you no longer operate under the laws of competition like the rest, where losing a job or getting sick means game over. From here on, it's compound interests and family trusts. You have successfully isolated yourself from the chaos of competition, for generations to come.\n\nTo apply a moralistic worldview to a system that doesn't operate on morals is a huge (categorical) mistake. You are basically using god to explain gravity.\n\nNobody cares for \"good\" code, \"good\" products, if, what ever a worker creates, doesn't generate profits, then this work becomes worthless for a company. How do companies know if their workers are profitable? When the competing capitalists find a way to become more profitable, when they found a way to extract more value out of their workers, i.e. by producing more with fewer people. Salaries are diluted profits.\n\nThat's why capitalism is a class-system in disguise. Legally, you're not a medieval serf, but operationally the role of a wageworker is to function as a source for profits like in historic times. For a while, engineers made good money because they build the systems that would make others redundant (warehouse workers) and companies more profitable (Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon). Now, it's the engineers them self selves that face the consequences of profit optimization. \n\nDoes this system create logical tensions, poverty and war: yes. Does it matter? No, because it's not about logic or moral beliefs, it's about surviving under competition and winning the game.",

Med device companies are usually managed by bean counters, not by engineers.  And a side effect of all the bureaucracy is that you end up shipping code with hundreds of known and already-fixed bugs that didn't make it into the formal build.\n\nFDA auditors rarely have any domain expertise in software,  so they usually only look at whether the paperwork looks like it was completed properly.  The \"formal\" testing is often also rather superficial.  The saving grace is that most medical devices are around for decades, which means serious bugs get found pretty early in the product lifecycle.",

The brother was probably a good coder but I wouldn't have known because he worked entirely in a silo. They had these crazy two week deadlines after they sealed a deal.. I don't know, I wasn't there for long.. I built one app for them (android) that was deployed to a tradeshow (had to do with ticketing) in two weeks time and packed up and left, never got around to iPhone because God knows how difficult it would have been to get on the app store. The code was a mess. It was riddled with bugs but I had no time to fix anything because the one guy who knew how to code and could've helped was busy with other things. They've since gone out of business. Almost exactly ten years ago I was with them.",

The commit ultimately has your name on it, why would you turn in something less than what you're capable of?\n\n> Why do I need to write the same high-level language in a different way than I did a year ago\n\nDo you actually need to do it in a different way?\n\n> when I was producing plenty of code that delivered plenty of business value\n\nHere it is. This is the source of confusion. If you were producing quality code, then you probably don't need to change. However, don't forget that there are legions of bad software developers who were not putting out quality code, and so AI is not actually worse than what they would have done.\n\n> Why do we need to reinvent the wheel again and again?\n\nWhy do we even need computers when people can do this by hand?",

The part yearning for more features will (and should?) never be the part that advocates stability, it’s not what it’s for. What I see lacking is a proper discussion at that level so that the (necessary) tradeoffs are made in the open. And I don’t think that counterpart is ever ground-level developers simply due to difference in power. I have seen this in at least partial action and know there’s a way but also agree that the current common approach is not that.\n\nI also slightly disagree with #2 because software is never done so the backlog is always infinite and that asking for more time should simply not be a thing (acknowledging that it very often still is). As a dev ”done” is *your* call, not anybody else’s. Here I’d blame dev culture/community and not really business (they just take advantage of it) for not boosting the pride and responsibility in being the one who gets shit ”done”. E.g. testing is part of ”done”, not something added to a dev produces.\n\nBottom line, though, I do agree with a severe lack of craftmanship in the software business even if I personally am able to carve out the space-time I need to deliver to my best ability. I see myself as a Software Craftsman, inspired by The Pragmatic Programmer, and try to empower devs around me to accept and fulfill the role as I see it. Through my years I’ve worked with and observed quite a few fellow craftsmen but sadly never in large enough numbers or concentration to truly deliver the software we should be enjoying.\n\nSo finally, I’m not attending this funeral but calling out for my fellow kind to stay true and spread the word; software is a craft and in craft there is pride!",

AI is not super useful for a guy like me who's been programming for 20 years, but it's comically useful for a junior programmer who's been programming for 20 months. It's primary utility to me is that there's no longer a line around the block for juniors asking me questions (although I miss that a bit.)\n\nBut reddit hates that fact and will reliably downvote this. I assume reddit's allergic reaction to this observation stems from r/Programming being mostly made up of college students who are just generally anxious about the day they have to look for a job.\n\nBut at the major tech companies, everybody wants juniors who express interest in AI. They don't have to actually be good at it. They just have to not be a little bitch about it.\n\nInterestingly, some of the candidates we've interviewed were convinced by their teachers to never use AI (which makes sense, because it undermines the value of the teacher.) So even though they were top students at top schools, we couldn't hire them out of risk that they might not continue learning on the job.

It depends a lot on the application how useful AI is imo BUT I always think AI is far more useful for senior developers.\n\nAs an example, a junior guy at work just figured out how to use co-pilot and it's a very mixed bag. On one hand, the code that he produced was FAR better but on the other hand, the logic of his code was horrible and due to producing more code than normal, it took me far longer to go through is PR and spot all the mistakes he had made.\n\nMe on the other hand, on projects where AI works well, I have probably worked twice as fast, with a bit better code but a lot better documented and united + integration tested. My 2 fellow senior developers that are working on the same application are also writing code using AI and for most of it, you'd not be able to spot whom of us did what.\n\nI definitely think the value is far greater for senior developers but the good part for junior developers is that their code will no longer stick out like a sore thumb and the more you set up your codebase to be easy on AI and reviewers, the better it will be for both juniors and seniors.",

Not overly complicated, but it was supposed to be a solution to a bug. Was it a solution? No, not at all. It was this insane, overly defensive custom event listener crafted to hook a secure function, if ever called, to check the output of the other function called, and if the output was wrong in several conditions, to rewrite the output. And still, it didn't really account for edge cases or why the fix needed to be implemented to begin with, and it also would fail if load order was not considered in some circumstances. \n\nIt didn't resolve the source of the bug which is what was wanted. Boolean gating it away downstream so no errors get thrown is not a fix!\n\nThe LLM solution was actually fairly sound, logically, but no actual human would write it because it was so much work where the coder would quickly realize how stupid of an implementation this was.\n\nThe actual solution was literally a single line fix and the LLM failed because they didn't prompt with full context.\n\nI am just thinking of all these companies that are just committing all this trash bloated AI slop and how much if a mess it is going to make for them that they can't just LLM their way out of. I say this as someone who loves using AI to speed up my work and clarify things, debug, and so on. But man, I know how flawed it is. You have to know what to throw out and when it's not reliable.",

AI is not super useful for a guy like me who's been programming for 20 years, but it's comically useful for a junior programmer who's been programming for 20 months. \n\nThey don't \"accomplish much more\", they \"output a lot more\", which is not the same thing. A junior + an LLM can reduce the signal:noise ratio of your PR queue until it's absolutely useless.\n\nA *senior* can also do that, but as a senior they are going to go back and forth **much more** with the LLM than read the code, hits the \"LGTM, create PR\" button and move on.\n\nI've looked at projects that people (here and on HN, I think) claimed was done by the LLM to a high quality, and without fail it was either:\n\n1. A very small codebase, or\n2. Horribly over-engineered (a 100k LoC project for a journal that integrates with the calendar, slack and email). That 100K doesn't count the code in the framework, BTW.\n\nWhen I look at what people are claiming as their productivity output, when they also claim \"having 20 years of experience\", I shake my head - no way would I pass that code in a review.\n\nThe only way I get really good code from an LLM is by a proper back and forth (pushing back on quite a lot of what it gives, and questioning the rationale for quite a lot of what it gives).\n\nHalf the time, you give the code back to the LLM and ask a pointed question like \"That looks horribly over-engineered\", they **will** respond with \"You're absolutely right\" and then proceed to change it.\n\nIf *even the LLM* can review the code and say \"Whoops, I made a boo-boo\", why aren't the \"seniors\" doing it? You can't review more than a few thousands of lines of code per day, so having the LLM spit out 20k lines/day means effectively no reviewing will be done.",

Instead of spending hours writing thousands of lines of code or searching Stack Overflow for syntax, engineers can use AI tools to handle the boring stuff.\n\n**The fallacy is that basic work being done today somehow \"doesn't count\".  When it absolutely, 100% counts.**\n\nI'll use another industry as the example.  Landscaping.  Lets say you found a perfect AI driven lawnmower.  All you have to do is drop it off at a home/office building, let it do it's thing, then pick it up an hour later, and it drives itself right back onto your truck.\n\nYou tell your staff \"hey guys, you don't have to worry about the 'grunt work' of mowing lawns anymore! You can do the more detailed work of planting flowers, trimming hedges, and things like that! Won't that be great!\"\n\nBut... 60% of your workers time is currently spent mowing lawns.  Sure - is the other work more interesting, and more skilled?  Of course, but... so what?  You just took away 60% of their work!!!  That's what they got paid to do! You don't need 50 landscapers on staff anymore.  Your 30 lawn mowers are replaced by 5 guys who just deliver AI lawnmowers to locations.\n\nThat's what's happening here.  Saying \"you don't have to do the boring stuff\" anymore is STUPID because we currently *get paid* to do the \"boring stuff.\"  When you take that away, you take work away.  You *take jobs away.* \n\nSo sure, it will only be the \"interesting\" stuff left, but... it will be the \"interesting\" stuff left for the 30% of remaining employees.  That 70% that get fired aren't going to feel comforted that their buddy Jim who still has a job has a more interesting job than he used to.",

I remember pushing an idea to lean more into merging and the wiki concept, where questions would stay open but feed into a wider group of similar problems with canonical answers that apply generally across a range. In the end, they leaned heavily into the \"one right answer\" approach, and we see that in how toxic it became.\n\nNowadays, I still think it *could* be a great platform, but it looks like Fog Creek and Joel Spolsky got out at the right time because it's been utterly gutted since then.",

[32k rep and 52 gold badges](https://stackoverflow.com/users/453435/Ky) attest to that (I've seen folks get higher rep faster by farming but badges tend to be more genuine). That means I've had access to moderation tools for the better part of a decade now, which is what solidified my opinion that the site maintainers don't give a shit about the toxicity problem.\n\nI slowed going there long before LLMs because the toxic community was just too much. _Still on Reddit tho._\n\nEvery 3 or 4 questions, I would get dismissed out-of-hand until I edited the question to be more acceptable. Not because my core issue was inappropriate, but because the other mods didn't like how I phrased it.\n\nEven in [my most banal of interactions on Meta StackExchange](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/posts/371191/revisions), I've received [strangely strong pushback](https://imgur.com/a/jyhR0Uy) just because I didn't know what went on behind closed doors.\n\nI would smurf sometimes, making a new account and asking the same kinda questions under that one. Then I wouldn't get so much as the time of day.\n\nTheir podcast ended up just about about cryptocurrency, and [when I brought up how that's inappropriate](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/407815/can-the-podcast-please-stop-making-episodes-about-cryptocurrencies-and-nfts), I was met with just a lot of \"yeah that's how it is; if you don't like it, don't listen\". **Some put very kindly**, yes, but no sign anyone running the place was actually taking feedback.\n\nPrehaps the biggest thing which drove public perception that it's an unwelcoming place, is the experience of having your question closed andor redirected. There's no discussion beforehand about whether that's appropriate, the phrasing is just nasty, and quite often you're left stranded with the same problem you came to SO to solve.",

It's especially bad at stack ranking places like Amazon or Atlassian.\n\nWhat you end up with is a culture that rewards people that \"plays the game\" and manages up very well, in that all they're really doing is taking credit for other people's work",

If everyone wants to cooperate and play “fair” it can work better than having everyone infighting, but if one person is being ruthless and selfish they gain an advantage over everyone else and the only way to counter it is to fight fire with fire.\n\nOnce a company hits a certain size you’re guaranteed to have at least one person like that, so that cutthroat culture becomes hard to avoid.\n\nI also think something like Dunbar’s number plays into it a bit as well (theory that humans brains can only maintain around 150 relationships). I think that as a company grows our brains can’t maintain the human relationships as well and so it’s easier to act ruthlessly. Basically, a laying off 5 people from a 50 person company is tougher decision than a laying off 500 people from a 5000 person company because at a 50 person company the person making the decision likely knows those people personally and sees them as real people. At a 5000 person company most of the people being laid off are just names on a list.",

          "text": "Here is my complete and honest take on this.\n\nStart with some basic assumptions: 1) We are all trying to look out for ourselves, which usually means earn money and often means further our career, and many if not most of us are trying to do good work while we're at it, but not everyone. 2) Most of us need to work cooperatively to accomplish things that are useful on a scale large enough to accomplish the above goals, and even more so for anyone who wants to have any sort of real, widespread impact; we're simply past the era where groundbreaking stuff can often be done by one person or even two or three - while it does happen, it's rare as hen's teeth.\n\nSo we end up organizing into, well, organizations. Of some sort. In this case we're talking companies, whether startups or the most valuable companies in the world or somewhere in between. With a handful of us, or a few dozen, or five hundred, or a few thousand, we can ship really cool stuff to the public that also gets us paid enough to be happy with it.\n\nAny org in a company can be sorted, I think, into roughly four classifications that are relevant to this article. They look a lot like the prisoner's dilemma...\n\nOne: The clockwork org: well funded, well staffed, problem is well understood, people work together pretty well and good work simply ticks out like clockwork. Every year there's a new X that everyone loves, or every six months there's a major improvement to Y product everyone pays for and/or everyone uses, or there are simply consistent and incremental improvements to a ubiquitous product, or every day customers are satisfied because issues are resolved, or every year or two something really neat and novel comes out that people love, or whatever it is. These orgs like any other have climbers, but most people are in it to win it from a collective point of view, working hard to benefit the whole and feeling happy with their personal acknowledgement and reward (probably pay, but not always.) There's not a lot of pressure to sharpen knives because there just aren't that many people trying to step on your or stab you in the back, most effort is spent on cooperation vs the backstabbing part of the prisoner's dilemma.\n\nTwo: The org that desperately needs a win because it's going to be an enormous win, and everyone is licking their chops at getting personally rewarded for that win... especially if they are at the top of the pile when it happens. This is the exact opposite of the first one. People spend far more effort on politicking and backstabbing and stepping and re-orging and climbing than they spend on simply delivering success. This is basically the roulette table where each player gets told that if he stabs the guy next to him at the table he simultaneously improves his payout while reducing his odds of getting the payout and does the math (or thinks he does the math) and finds that the utility of doing so is greater than 1 because the increase of payout to the sole winner is 100x while the reduction in chance is only like 5%... but then half the players at the table whip their knives out. You know what happens here? Usually nobody wins, but a lot of people lose.\n\nThree and four: the two orgs above except with the opposite perspectives (the slam-dunk product org filled with backstabbing that often kills it, and the moonshot org where everyone works cooperatively and are happy to share in riches if they win.) Three is sadly common, four is unfortunately fairly rare. Startups think they're the fourth kind, until there's real money involved (a startup exit) and then far too often everyone except for one or two or three people find out that they've been diluted to zero in some backroom game and stabbed in the back at the finish line rather than it being a constant the entire time.\n\nOP, your group was (2). There were multiple orgs who were chasing ML and none of them had a real success to their name as far as the market, investors, board, etc were concerned. Everyone spent far more time jockeying for position than delivering a fucking product that worked. It got multiple of your management chain fired (\"retired\", whatever.) You were in the middle of it. You weren't playing the game, other people were just playing you. And of course you spent a long long time coasting, which is part of why the org failed to deliver - there were many like you who didn't do much for months and management was blind to it, willfully or incompetently. (Much harder to get away with that in a clockwork org, people generally understand what is getting produced by each person on a regular basis, though of course plenty still manage.) It all sucks, you would hope that any company wouldn't have this sort of sheer incompetence in what they see as a must-do project, but it happens.\n\nFor what it's worth, I know quite a few people who work there at clockwork orgs. Yes everyone is always busy and their thing is more important than your thing and yes people would like to have more than they currently have but for the most part relations are cordial even if a bit tight and products ship on time and people buy them by the truck-full every day. If you transferred internally to an org that constantly delivers value, visibly, every year, multiple times a year, you woulda found a much better environment. Lumping together all large corporations is tempting but not only are they different team-by-team, but also vp/exec by vp/exec, and of course quite different from each other as well. In any case, hopefully you enjoy what you're doing now quite a lot more, it sucks to spend 8+ hours a day not enjoying it.",

Customers talk to customer support which talk to product owners which talk to QA which talk to dev leads which finally talk to devs? How many levels of indirection are we talking about here? Can we improve it by adding a few more layers of middle management? If devs are allowed to have full ownership of their software from design to rollout, they will want product and customer support leads to be their slack channels and to have them participate in standups. So that they don't have to rely on chinese whispers to understand what the customers want and what the pain points are. And product and customer support want that too: any dev who's ever had to work with first level support of an external supplier knows that 50% of problems can be solved quickly and easily if you just get to talk to one of their devs directly. Your company doesn't understand async communication and that devs don't have to drop everything every time a message is sent in slack? That sounds like a you problem.\n\n>since many of them aren't even technically inclined people. \n\nThey aren't retarded just because they didn't become devs themselves. If you talked to them you'd see that they are most likey intelligent people who want to excel at their job. Even their feeble minds can learn how to operate high tech like an \"issue tracker\" if you take five minutes to explain it to them. And if they can't? If they've been at the company for 20 years and refuse to learn anything other than email? Maybe it's time for them to move on.\n\nAs for github discussions in particular: One of the few value propositions that github's tech stack has over gitlab is that their search is much better. In particular, issues and pull requests are integrated. You can just remove the `is:pr` from the search bar and run a search across both. This makes it much easier for devs and users to find the places where a keyword was referenced. Discussions ruin this because they are not integrated at all. You have to remember to run at least two queries every time. You might not like it, but Jira solved this issue a long time ago with their highly advanced, sql-like search that can search across the entire jira instance at once. Github discussions are a step backwards in terms of dev-exp and user-exp.\n\nAnd even if they were integrated, it would just be a glorified way to tag issues. Devs are unable to find those issues that are ready for implementation? Here's an idea: click the \"add tag: ready-for-implementation\" button instead of the \"convert to issue\" button.",

If you try to implement all of that, you end up with a spaghettified mess. If you try to sort through it, you will spend ALOT of time on that task alone. Developer time is *fucking expensive*, and defending roadmap sanity from feature-creep is not a cost-effectove use of that time.\n\n**b) The assumption that \"pain points\" identified by customers are b.1) real or b.2) actionable by devs**\n\nI have worked my way from low-level tech support to senior software engineer. I have had calls at 3AM because \"the system is down\", which then turned out to be some genius being unable to tell whether his fucking VPN was connected or not. I have had stakeholders ask me to fix that the app \"feels sluggish\"...the app in question being **their** companies crappy implementation against our backend. I have wasted hours of my life slogging through logfiles looking for alleged bugs, that turned out to be misconfigured firewalls.\n\nMost things customers, or stakeholders, perceive as pain points that a dev should fix, are caused by infra, environment, user error, or a combination of those.\n\nAs for b.2), even if a problem is actually real, 7/10 \"bug reports\" or \"issues\" are various iterations on *\"this does not work please halp!\"*. What doesn't work? What have you tried? When did it fail? How? What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? Even simple things like *\"What version of the software are you running and what's your OS?\"* are often information we only get after asking for the umpteenth time. Ever asked yourself why so many issue trackers include a template, complete with command lines to copypaste to provide essential data? *BECAUSE PEOPLE GET IT WRONG ALL THE TIME*. And even with the templates, they still get it wrong too often for comfort.\n\nMaking sure this mess is fixed, and I am gonna repeat myself here, *is not an effective use of a devs time*. A dev should get a bug report, written by someone who knows what that entails, with all the required info, preferably *AFTER* someone made sure that the perceived bug isn't actually some genius trying to run the service on a Debian installation that was last updated when vikings roamed the coast of England.\n\n> any dev who's ever had to work with first level support of an external supplier knows that 50% of problems can be solved quickly and easily if you just get to talk to one of their devs directly.\n\nQuickly and easily **FOR WHOM?**\n\nFor the customer? Sure, because the dev has more knowledge about the software than a support technician.\n\nFor the devs, this is hell on earth. I worked in shops where devs had to do 1st level support. The only thing that would beat this shit as a productivity killer, would be Pai Mei from \"Kill Bill\" standing behind me, hitting me over the head with his stick at random intervals.\n\nServing the customer is a noble goal, but when it kills dev productivity (and again, dev time is *fuckin expensive*), that's a problem that should be addressed post-haste.\n\n> Your company doesn't understand async communication and that devs don't have to drop everything every time a message is sent in slack? That sounds like a you problem.\n\nMy company understands how expensive dev time is, and how important filtering is to use this expensive resource effectively. If anyone doesn't, well, that sounds like a their-problem.",

Issues are barely a value proposition unless you won't pay for better, and even then I think other free options are fine. GitHub actions is, commercially successful, but I don't think it's actually good, though in fairness many of their competitors are legitimately worse. Especially wrt billing.

There is a tradeoff though because it uses more CPU, and you have to do a bunch of performance testing to see if it's really better when turning it on. It also had a bunch of CVEs which delayed adoption. So a lot of large projects haven't adopted it because of the security aspect. It avoids system calls and lets you read/write directly to a buffer in kernel memory. Also, processes that use it need specific permissions from the OS, so it's not as plug and play as just running a regular Java process. Oh yeah and a lot of popular Linux OS don't have a new enough kernel to take advantage of the full io_uring API. Overall, it's still new enough that it's going to take a while before we start seeing it used more. My guess would be 3-5 years.",

If another strncpy copies from name to another buffer of a larger size, that second copy is capable of copying elements of next element of the struct, address. If the next element of the struct is supposed to be secret, that's bad.\n\nThis makes the function a violation of Postel's law: \"Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you emit.\" The function implicitly requires either that num be the minimum of the source / destination buffer length or null terminated strings, but does not ensure that the output is null terminated.\n\nI grant that this saves one byte in each field, but I don't feel this is a worthwhile tradeoff. I'm already using a memory allocator that uses 16-31ish bytes for bookkeeping and padding for each allocation. Wasting a byte per string is a rounding error.\n\n>And it pads with zeros to guarantee that you don't leak uninitialized memory.\n\nI disagree that this is a useful thing for the string copy function to ensure.\n\nI don't feel like I'm consistent enough to remember to initialize every field of a struct - I would rather `memset()` the struct before use or `calloc()` it than try to ensure that I have remembered to initialize each field. (Note that due to structure padding, initializing every field of a struct is not guaranteed to initialize every byte of a struct.)\n\nIn most cases, the compiler can prove that this `memset()` is a dead store anyway, so this has no performance cost if I've remembered to initialize every field.",

Memsetting char arrays to null prior to their first use and replacing all the strcpys with strncpys bounded to the field lengths they were copying into got rid of about 80% of the crashes. The rest were an assortment of use-after-free errors and null pointer dereferences.\n\n\nA couple months refactoring in the project got us to about 0 crashes a year. We did have an occasional one after that, but at least one of those was an issue with database index corruption that was out of our control. The team ended up getitng rid of the duty pager after two or three months of the big stability refactor, because why keep paying for a pager that no one ever pages?",

                  "text": "C++ enables significantly more complex programs than C did. If I recall correctly, the C application I was maintaining back in the day was 40-60K lines of code and any given run through the code would interact with 10-15K lines of code tops. Old Timey C also has some well-tested and used tools to analyze what the code is doing. Once I got done with the low-hanging fruit in our stability refactor, I found the various malloc and use-after free errors by building the code with [Electric Fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Fence) and running it against some problematic files we'd encountered. The system was very deterministic in its bugs -- if a file caused a crash the first time it was processed, it was more or less guaranteed to always cause a crash.\n\n\nPretty much all the C++ code I write is heavily threaded and most of the weirdness stems from threading issues rather than the traditional memory issues that C was known for. Even with the unit tests that no one ever wrote in the C days, I might have the threads line up in just the right way 1% of the time and expose a place where I should have been using a mutex to synchronize memory access. I was just looking at a fun little bug the other day where I was breaking database loading for a graph up into individual data objects and dispatching loads to a thread pool and I needed to find a place to put a consistently correct \"This load is done\" signal. I had to make a pretty significant change to my design in order to do that because it was literally impossible with my original implementation. I ended up delaying submission of all the nodes to be processed until after the routine had examined the entire graph, because otherwise it would queue up a node that would get processed prior to adding any more, and the system would think it was done.\n\n\nI can't reason about every single execution branch in a system like that, and we're writing more and more systems like that. At best the language you use can force you into safer practices, but I think it can also lull you into a false sense of security because you might start to think you can write code at this level of complexity without really knowing about things like memory synchronization that you explicitly have to think about when using a language like C++. There isn't a silver bullet that can insure that you don't have to think about things like that, because for all that the compiler knows about the code, it still doesn't think about every single interaction that code could end up having. Java was suppose to be that silver bullet too, back in the late '90's, and we saw how well that went. Rust is just history repeating itself in that respect.\n\n\nIf you're curious about my graph code you can find it [here](https://github.com/FlyingRhenquest/RequirementsManager). I'm current wrapping up a [Imgui Node Editor](https://github.com/FlyingRhenquest/ImguiWidgets) to create and edit graphs of those nodes. It's probably pretty solid for single user use, but currently if two users are editing the same graph at the same time, it's very likely that one will overwrite the node information of the other when they try to write back to the database. I can mitigate that to a degree by keeping track of which nodes are modified, but that would require modifying all the node getters and setters to set a changed flag. I could even make that more granular and keep track of individual fields in a node if I want to, but I'd probably want to go to code generation (which I also have a [project](https://github.com/FlyingRhenquest/codegen) for) if I'm going to try to do that. I'm not sure if I really want my nodes to be that complex at this point, though.",

There's almost no value in mocking API calls, in a real life you'll find that the actual API behaves just a little different, or changes over time, making your test look good for coverage purposes, and not much more. YMMV of course, but I usually create an interface, have the real integration and a fake integration. At least I don't have to deal with the obscure error messages mocking frameworks give, I am less tempted to mock every service call which will make it impossible to refactor anything later, and it usually allows me to write acceptance tests up front, should there be value in that.",

It’s a wonderfully imaginative book, rich in metaphor and analogy, and filled with pearls of wisdom. It’s a must-read for anyone working in the software industry. The 20th anniversary edition is recommended for its extended content.\n\nI came across it in the university library IIRC (though long ago) and support the sentiment. I figured it'd be pretty dated, but it seems to have held up well and while I can't really recall examples to show, I remember thinking that the book was a fun read. Some classics are absolute slogs, but this one I suspect most of us will breeze through.",

Normalising docs actually get changed immediately as needed.\n\nI get that. I can translate that. I don’t know if I as a second year University student would have understood the implication. That a problem my team struggles with today, was the same thing he struggled with 60 years ago.\n\nThere are many people who discuss living documentation.\n\nThat’s one example.

That's just not really the case anymore, someone going through documentation for me would be nice but not a fulltime job for them because it's not that much work (and you definitely wouldn't need several people), and the closest analogue to oldschool paperwork would be writing up PRs and resolving tickets which I'd rather just do myself anyway.\n\nI'm not the person you asked, I think a lot of the book holds true today without issue, and you can even draw some good applicable wisdom about this chapter too.

In the end, the potential problems arising from code base rot far exceeds the potential problems of giving up the ability to mix multiple paradigms.\n\nI'm talking large scale paradigms here, since most any language will at least have some bits of multiple paradigms. Rust isn't a functional language, but it uses a number of functional ideas. It's not OOP in the sense that many people think of OOP (e.g. Java or traditional C++ style) but it uses objects heavily and supports polymorphism via traits (but not implementation inheritance.)\n\nBut, the fact that it doesn't support implementation inheritance avoids a lot of problems that, though they are not inherent to implementation inheritance itself, tend to arise in practical applications of implementation inheritance in commercial development.",

          "text": "A long winded way to appeal to the \"right tool for the job\" idea. Problem is, it is very easy to take it too far, by either underplaying the suitability of a particular tool for many tasks, and overplaying the advantages of a particular tool for a given task. 20 years ago I used to think functional programming was _the_ future, I loved OCaml (still do), looked up to Haskell, and scorned C and C++ for being unneeded for most jobs.\n\nBut the more I code, the more I'm realising that even weak old unsafe C is way underrated.\n\n> Procedural programming tamed the chaos of spaghetti code.\n\nDon't forget about _structured_ programming though. Procedures are freaking amazing, but to make the `goto` spaghetti go away you also need the disciplined control flow that comes with `if` and `while`. And a cursory look at Wikipedia suggests the structured part came after the procedural part.\n\nAlso, \"procedural\" mostly means \"neither functional nor OO\" nowadays.\n\n> OOP arose when systems grew too large to fit in one head,\n\nFollowing you so far.\n\n> offering modularity and encapsulation.\n\nErr… I believe it wasn't the only one, nor even the first. Don't forget that modularity was also offered by… _modules_. And encapsulation needs nothing more than abstract data types.\n\nIn fact, the only two _new_ things OOP offered, were inheritance (now largely avoided, in part because it _breaks_ modularity), and subtype polymorphism, which was already possible with closures — which I reckon where mostly unheard of in existing imperative languages.\n\nOn the other hand, OOP _did_ popularised (not invented), an extremely powerful idea, that is now used all the time: _instantiation_. Before OOP was popular, complex data structures tended to be global. Take Lex and Yacc for instance, they assumed the program would have only _one_ lexer and _one_ parser, so they stored their internal state in global variables. But with OOP it became obvious to anyone how we might have several of them in the same program: just put their internal state in a class, then instantiate that class as many times as required.\n\nOf course such instantiation predated OOP as we know it to day by a couple decades. It was called \"plex\", \"record\", \"struct\", and \"class\", it was used before the Sketchpad demo. But it would seem it only became truly mainstream when OOP took over.\n\n> Functional programming emerged to handle concurrency, immutability, and data transformation at scale.\n\nThat sounds like a retcon, though I can't say for sure. As for handling concurrency (and parallelism), most of the time there's a much more mundane answer: just don't share mutable state across threads, and stop synchronising all the time.\n\nPurely functional data structures are amazing for stuff like \"undo\", though.\n\n> Younger developers often equate minimalism with superiority. “Keep it procedural,” they say. “Classes and abstractions are overkill.”\n\nFunnily enough, I did the reverse: I used to think abstractions (FP abstractions to be precise) were all the rage, and I'm now realising we can do almost as good with much, _much_ less.\n\n> Performance Isn’t the Only Risk\n\nCorrect. Though I'm not sure about seeing it as a risk. Performance is a _requirement_. We don't have infinite CPU time, _some_ threshold must be met. Sometimes the threshold is easily met with an accidentally quadratic Python script. Sometimes it requires a fast algorithm and SIMD or a GPU.\n\nThe following paragraph correctly touches on some performance myths, that though in some sense are true (immutable data structures do take more memory than mutable ones, virtual function calls or similar do have an extra indirection costs…), do not matter in many cases. They may be things to watch out for, but they're never hard and fast rules.\n\nOn the other hand, performance is not a niche concern. Noticeable startup times for instance, especially for popular programs, have more impact than we give them credit for: wasting a second per day per users quickly amounts to a _lot_ of seconds when you have millions of users. We also like our apps to be \"snappy\", which in practice means run at our screen's refresh rate, ideally with less than a frame of delay between our inputs and a visible result. Especially for things like drag & drop and animations.",

                  "text": "Yeah, maybe, but there is reason to hope that it will be different this time;\n\n\"Big tech\" has always been different form other industries for 2 reasons: 1) they are asset-light companies that make a lot of money regardless and 2) they always had a growth-story to ride on.\n\nNumber 2. ended somewhere around 2012. The smartphone was the last true big reveal of big tech, the last thing where most people in the world really went \"wow! this is amazing!\".\n\nEver since then, these companies have been **desperate** to find a new super-grower. So, instead of actually having *innovation* and products that naturally generated growth stories, they started making growth stories themselves their product. That's why we went through all the shit: Big Data, IoT, wearables, Crypto, NFTs, VR/AR, Spatial Computing...and now AI. None of these were big, tremendous innovations, they were hyped up stories.\n\nGo back in time and look about how people talked about \"Big Data\". How it would \"change everything\" or \"revolutionize industries\". **They used the exact same vocabulary they now use for promoting AI, almost verbatim!**\n\nSure, there was, and is, *some* money in all of these hype-cycles (some people did buy some VR headsets I guess, and some IoT devices are kinda-sorta useful). But the actual *value* generated was nowhere near the hyped up promises. But that's okay from the PoV of the people in charge of the shitshow. They don't care about actual products, they only care about \"number-go-up\" on the stock market...and as long as there was a shiny new thingy to dangle before ever more gullible investors, stock got bought and number went up.\n\nThe fact that money was essentially free after governments bailed out the banks in 2008 exacerbated this. And that's how companies  that haven't really innovated anything of note, actively burned billions on crap, and enshittified everything they touched for the better part of 1.5 decades, got more valuable than ever before.\n\n----\n\nSo, they needed a new growth-story. And along came generative AI. And someone had the super-duper-verystablegenius-bigbrain idea, of betting on a growth story, that required trillions in datacenter buildouts and GPUs, ate tons of power, and had piss poor unit-cost scaling.\n\n**And thus, advantage number 1 went out the window as well.** Because with this AI craze, big tech turned themselves into *asset-heavy* companies. All the problems of traditional industry, with none of the experience in how to deal with them; including the golden rule of any industry that requires heavy assets to serve its customers: **Build for the Market.**\n\nNo one in their right mind would build a car factory for 5 billion, or a nuclear power plant for 10bn, if they weren't 100% sure that there is demand for it. Big Tech however, thought that all their uniqueness still applied, and would always apply, and started splooging out hundreds of billions in borrowed money...for a product which we now know barely has any real market.\n\nAnd they also cannot just pull out of this one. When you're asset-light, and a hype cycle slows down, you can just pivot to the next shiny thing, no hurt feelings. But datacenters are real buildings, on real land, that require real hardware, and real power. So when someone builds all that on borrowed money, and the bet doesn't pay off, things get interesting. And due to the nature of these particular datacenters, they also cannot just be used for something else...1) because the hardware is very specific, 2) *there is no market for it*. Sure, GPUs are useful for some other things...but not on that scale! Who needs 8GW in new compute for physics departments, protein folding and weather forecast?\n\nWhat big tech will end up with here, is a massive oversupply of *pyhsical assets*, built on debt, which they cannot sell to anyone, and which loses them tons of money every hour it exists.\n\nAnd remember: Those companies are valueable because investors buy their stock, because they trust them to grow eternally. So what do you think will happen when investors realize what I just described? Exactly. It's going to be a shitshow.\n\n---\n\nAnd btw. the game is also different this time for the smaller players in this hype cycle. In the past, for all these hyped up things, startups absorbed VC money until they got acquired by someone. Problem is: **Almost no one is acquiring AI startups.** And why would they? Most of these smaller companies are essentially just a wrapper around some prompts around some model offered by the big players. They have no moat. They are not unique. Anyone who wants to can just instantly replicate them. Why would anyone buy these companies, when they can just wrote a similar prompt and get the same thing?\n\n\n\n----\n\nSo in summary, AI will likely be the straw that breaks the camels back, because it's not just another hype cycle...it's the hype cycle that the tech industry burned every advantage they previously had, to somehow make it happen.\n\nThat's what makes me believe that this crash will be different. It will be bad for everyone, sure. But it will be a horror show for big tech. Whatever happens, I don't think that their current rot-economy MO will make it through that.\n\nAnd good riddance.",

          "text": "Thanks for writing a beginner friendly post. However, I think the example could teach some bad practices to a beginner, sending them down the wrong path. Here are my suggestions: \n\n* You've used quite a lot of packages for a small codebase. Given we're making one logical component, I would use one package for this. You might want to split it into a load balanced package and a main package, but more than that is unnecessary and inefficient. \n* Minor point: the slice management in the pool package isn't great, leading to unnecessary allocations. The constructor makes a slice of length zero, which is likely to be a wasted allocation (it likely allocates more than zero, but if it's less than the final length, it will be wasted). It seems simpler to take the full set of servers in the constructor, rather than looping over them in the main package. The lack of locking isn't ideal either. If you add a server at runtime, to increase your capacity, it could lead to a crash currently. \n* It's better to use a single HTTP client in all places, so you can benefit from things like connection pooling. Currently, you're creating different clients in each place, with different configuration. \n* There's no locking in the health checker, which is prone to various issues. It also seems to sleep its interval between each server, rather than each round. That is, a user might set an interval of 1 minute, expecting you to check each server every minute, but you will actually just check one server per minute.\n* The `BalancerStrategy` interface only supports context-free approaches like round robin, as it provides no inputs. A strategy like IP hash couldn't work with this interface, as the client IP isn't provided.\n* The round robin has an unused `sync.Once`.\n* You probably want to parse (and validate) the server URL when it's added to the pool, rather than on every request. This would give better error handling (a bad server would be rejected from the pool, rather than breaking 1 in every `n` requests received) and would be more efficient. \n* For actually proxying the request to the backend server, I would strongly recommend using something like [net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httputil@go1.25.5#ReverseProxy), rather than rolling it yourself. Proxying isn't as straightforward as it looks, and there are some subtle security risks. In particular, you're currently reading the full response into memory, which will break your load balancer if you start getting lots of big responses. Again, you're using a new HTTP client, except you're using a new client for every request, which is particularly wasteful.\n\nAgain, thank you for trying to help beginners, but I think it's important that beginners start with best practices, rather than getting into bad habits.",

The main differences are:\n\n* It's all in one package (the top-level package), with a small main package in //cmd/bulb. This ensures that the core functionality could be imported elsewhere and it's documented automatically. The main package just has the opinionated invocation logic.\n* The [Backend](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/SlyMarbo/bulb#Backend) and [Pool](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/SlyMarbo/bulb#Pool) both use mutexes to guard access.\n* The health checker uses a configurable HTTP client, managed centrally in the health check config.\n* All the preparation and validation is done ahead of time, so that as little work is done when processing requests as possible.\n* The package has fairly extensive tests and there are benchmarks for each strategy.\n\n[github.com/SlyMarbo/bulb](https://github.com/SlyMarbo/bulb) ([docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/SlyMarbo/bulb))",
