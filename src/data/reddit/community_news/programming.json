I've also had to pull out 30% of the dev capacity because it wasn't making margin while we bring in basic release management, automated test, working CI/CD and other patterns.\n\nThere's a massive co-hort of of engineers <35 who've never put together a big 6 month release, and it shows. I've had to bring back old-ass practices into play like formal gold candidate releases etc - the type of shit you did when you were shipping CD-ROMs - just to tighten up a monthly major release that was creating havoc with client escalations month after month. We're quietly rebuilding the entire deployment pipeline, encapsulating code and services and putting proper interfaces in, and getting ready to shift off some old technology decisions, but it's a slow process.\n\nThere's far too many people in the industry who can only code to an explicit instruction from a senior, and don't have the skills to identify re-use opportunities etc. AI will just produce more of that explosion of non-talent in my view.",

Because I don’t need high level thinking, what I need is someone to pair with who knows bog standard typescript better than I do, which is a low bar. And the bonus is what it does something flagrantly wrong or non-idiomatic I _generally_ can smell it from a mile away and can at least glean what not to do even from bad sessions. \n\nAll that being said I also get extremely frustrated with the capriciousness and lack of cohesion of the js ecosystem. There are a few shining beacons of logic and reasonable convention but most of the time I am just baffled that it caught on because so much of it is opinionated while also being sectarian so it feels like you have to struggle through a half dozen reinvented wheels, you need to reinvent a half dozen wheels, then maybe you find a workflow that doesn’t result in a bunch of make work wheel spinning. It’s no wonder most models veer in your doing over complex wordy galaxy brained shit, the corpus varies so wildly across all dimensions of quality and cohesiveness.",

A good senior develoepr that cleanly understands how to do all aspects of coding is enhanced by AI because AI can code faster than you for a lot of things. For example, it will blow me out of the water writing unit tests.\n\n2. A junior developer will immediately level up to an intermediate because the AI is already better than them. It knows how to code, it understands a lot of the simpler aspects of coding quite well, and it can simply churn out decent code pretty fast if you're good enough with it.\n\n3. A junior developer will be hard capped in their skill progression by AI. They will become too reliant on it and struggle to understand things on their own. They won't be able to give you answers without the AI nor will they understand when the AI is wrong. And worse, they won't be inquisitive enough to question the AI. They'll run into bugs they have to debug and have no idea what to do, where to start, etc.\n\nI stand by it as my experience in the workplace has shown.

Maybe they use AI to do 99% of their work or 1% of their work. As a manager, I only use it for super boring crap like converting a code base in one language to a code base in another language.\n\nBut the design department's use of AI is more interesting. Our design department has 70 designers, and only 10 of those 70 are kind of technical. The other 60 designers sit around designing all these design experiences in Figma, way way faster than the engineers can implement the designs.\n\nAnd it's not even clear whether we *should* implement all the designer's designs. Their designs look prettier and probably are a better user experience, but that doesn't necessarily make us more money. We have lots of designers because our software makes billions and it's fine, but they mostly sit around unhappy that their designs don't make it into product.\n\nSo in late 2025 they all started just asking the AI to implement their designs. And that works, at least in a prototyping sense. So now they're all using their own designs in prototype form. And I know a couple of them have changed their own designs, based on the results of the prototype.\n\nThis is super productive, because now instead of having to harass my engineers to implement bad designs, they only have to harass my engineers to implement well tested, fully prototyped designs, that have already had many rounds of design iteration.\n\nOf course I know my engineers just copy and paste the AI prototype code into the real codebase.

LLMs turned basically into a \"high level programming language\", just one with unpredictable compiler. It's what developers have been doing for many years already - make highly expressive programming languages, where you write little code and get a lot of functionality. Oneliner in Python could be hundreds lines of C or thousands lines of assembly. This is just another step - oneliner prompt could be hundreds of lines of python. With the caveat that this \"compiler\" is not deterministic and often generates incorrect code... When you compile your C code to a binary, you don't disassemble it to inspect the assembly and verify it's correct, you trust that the compiler works fine. With LLMs no such guarantees exist.\n\n> This is partly because composing prompts and giving context to the LLM takes a lot of time, sometimes comparable as writing the code manually.\n\nAs for the detail level of prompts - that's also nothing new. Anyone who has been programming for more than 10-15 years has seen this. We've been here before. What vibe coders re-discovered as \"LLM spec driven development\" is nothing more than what used to be called \"Model Driven Development\" - that was the idea that non-developers could simply draw UML diagrams and generate software from that. And there are still tools that actually let you do that! The twist? To get what you really wanted the diagrams would have to be as detailed as the code would be, which essentially turned this into a \"graphical programming language\" and those non-developers became developers of this weird language.\nThat's exactly what we see now with LLMs - people simply became \"programmers\" of this weird prompt programming language. Unfortunately as far as programming languages go, it's a very bad one...",

Ultimately it is speed up but you spend far more time reading code than writing it when doing it this way.\n\nBut letting it handle C++ template errors is worth it alone.

The fact that they found no statistically significant productivity gains *is* the far more interesting finding, but it's not what they were looking for, and it's not the best study design for looking at that. It is of course still surprising that they found no evidence that AI users are faster when the AI knows the library and the people do not.\n\nThe fair comparison would be on a population that's familiar with the library, half with AI, half without. And where they're allowed to use agents rather than just chat, since one would expect that to be faster. And perhaps accounting for what they're able to multitask on while the AI is responding, though I personally suspect that the context switching there doesn't actually lend itself to much efficient multitasking, at least not between high-demand tasks, probably just things like getting a coffee.\n\nBut I think that would still be a largely academic study with little real-world value. I personally would want to compare devs in a large existing codebase that they're familiar with, and include code quality metrics and QA feedback as metrics. That's supposed to be the tradeoff, and so any result other than AI being as slow or slower (a result most people don't expect) doesn't help much, since it doesn't tell you the price you're paying. I expect that to be a difficult study, since I would expect different types of AI use to have vastly different impacts on code quality. For example I suspect that just using GitHub copilot auto complete would have virtually no impact, whereas vibecoding would produce irredeemable trash.",

And what I’ve noticed is two things: 1) the AI has no frame of reference for all the requirements for the code and thus for writing tests, its primary concern is writing ones that will pass. Sometimes the process of testing exposes bugs in your code, but the AI will then adjust the test to pass the bug case. And 2) I know that I am getting worse at writing and verifying tests on my own for lack of practice. \n\nThese are just issues in relatively insignificant avenues of use. I worry a lot for newer devs who I know are just writing things with AI and skipping over both comprehension of the codebase and the ability to troubleshoot.

That ALONE should be enough to discount it. \n\nI want to address this: \n\n> This seems to contradict the massive push that has occurred in the last weeks, were people are saying that AI speeds them up massively(some claiming a 100x boost), that there is no downsides to this\n\nThis is not the narrative I've been seeing. For me, I think the new narrative is more along the lines of \"It's a very powerful tool that you have to use intelligently, not just vibe code\". \n\nWhich this paper seems to be reinforcing. Here's a choice quote: \n\n> Among participants who use AI, we find a stark divide in skill formation outcomes between high-scoring interaction patterns (65%-86% quiz score) vs low-scoring interaction patterns (24%-39% quiz score). The high scorers only asked AI conceptual questions instead of code generation or asked for explanations to accompany generated code; these usage patterns demonstrate a high level of cognitive engagement\n\nThis is not a paper about how AI use can rot your brain, even though the headline would suggest so. This is a paper about how you have to use AI \"the right way\". \n\nI would *really* like to let my confirmation bias do the work for me - I think these tools are junk and a net harm on society - but basic skepticism says this paper really needs to be considered with a great deal of scrutiny.",

          "text": "Oh, boy. It's another round of reddit finds an AI paper that has a nuanced take on AI, and waves it around like a flag to justify their refusal to adapt to a changing world. You guys are starting to remind me of the people who constantly bitched about cellphones when they first came out or the guy who insists that everyone he meets hears about how he doesn't own a tv.\n\nIf you actually read the methodology instead of just the abstract, you’d see this paper isn't the \"AI is useless\" smoking gun you guys so desperately crave.\n\nThe study wasn't measuring senior devs churning out code they've written a thousand times and already understand. It was looking at novice workers trying to learn a completely new library from scratch.\n\nThe \"no productivity gain\" headline is misleading. The average speed was dragged down because some participants spent massive amounts of time (up to 30%) just composing queries and trying to get the prompt right. There was a group, the AI Delegators, who just let the model do the work. They finished the fastest.\n\n\nThe catch is that the pure delegators tanked the post-coding quiz scores (39%) because they bypassed the learning process entirely.\n\nWhat the \"AI kills coding\" crowd is missing is that it is possible to use AI while still building competency. The paper explicitly identified \"High-Scoring Interaction Patterns\" that preserved skill formation. Participants who used the AI to ask conceptual questions (Why does this work?) instead of just asking for code generation scored 65% on the evaluation, higher than the delegators and at comparable levels to the average of the no-AI group. People who asked for code and an explanation had high learning outcomes than all but the top end of the non-AI group.\n\n**The Generation-Then-Comprehension group actually scored higher on comprehension (86% vs 65%) than the non-AI group, although they did take slightly longer.** But the \"humans are getting lazy from using AI\" group didn't bother to read past the title and abstract of this study.\n\nThe breakdown is basically this:\n\n1. The Conceptual Inquiry group was faster than the non-AI group and scored comparable to them.\n2. The Hybrid Code-Explanation group was slightly slower than non-AI and scored slightly higher than them.\n3. The Generation-Then-Comprehension group was also slightly slower than the non-AI group, but scored the highest on comprehension.\n\nThe authors aren't saying, \"don't use AI.\" They're saying don't use AI to bypass learning. It’s evidence of what anyone in education could tell you. Cognitive offloading kills learning. If you treat the AI as a magic answer box, you stunt your growth. If you treat it as a tutor and stay cognitively engaged, you get the utility without the brain rot.\n\nThis isn't the slam dunk you think it is. It's a critical analysis of what works and what doesn't. But this sub doesn't care about that. They just have an emotional need to feel validated in hating AI tools.",

You save time on boilerplate, but you spend more time validating, debugging, and understanding generated code. If you don’t actively engage with the output, your mental model of the system definitely gets weaker.\n\nI think the real issue is how people use AI\n\n* If it’s used as a shortcut to avoid thinking → yes, skills degrade.\n* If it’s used as a collaborator or accelerator → it can genuinely help.\n\nThe “10x developer” narrative feels more like hype than reality. Most real gains happen when AI is used for:\n\n* exploring solutions,\n* summarising large codebases,\n* generating scaffolding,\n* catching obvious bugs, not blindly writing core logic.\n\nAlso, speed alone isn’t the right metric. Software development is mostly about understanding systems, requirements, and trade-offs. AI can generate code, but it can’t replace the mental model of the system and that’s exactly what this paper seems to highlight.\n\nSo I don’t think AI coding is useless or revolutionary. It’s more like a power tool, great in skilled hands, dangerous in careless ones.\n\nCurious how others here use AI without losing understanding of their codebase.",

If you have access to the compromised binaries you can see where it was contacting to get the malicious updates. Which region is the server in, and has that IP been used for other attacks in the past?\n\nYou can also identify based on the time the attack occurred - what time-zone was it done in? If it was performed at 3am in China then it's not likely to be a Chinese group, but if it's like 1:30pm in Beijing, after time for some nice lunch? Much more reasonable.\n\nAlso, you can gather information by looking at the targets - what kinds of systems were targeted? Who were the victims? The article mentioned that the attack only affected certain targets, so you can gauge who the perpetrator was by what they had to gain based on who was targeted.\n\nYou can also look at the choice of targets and timing to correlate to in-world current events. Which targets were picked and why would that timing matter to various suspects?\n\nYou add all these little pieces of evidence up and figure out what the percentage chance of various attackers is.",

The shared hosting server in question was compromised until the 2nd of September, 2025. On this particular date, the server had scheduled maintenance where the kernel and firmware were updated. After this date, we could not identify any similar patterns in logs, and this indicates that bad actors have lost access to the server. We also find no evidence of similar patterns on any other shared hosting servers.\n> 2. Even though the bad actors have lost access to the server from the 2nd of September, 2025, they maintained the credentials of our internal services existing on that server until the 2nd of December, which could have allowed the malicious actors to redirect some of the traffic going to https://notepad-plus-plus.org/getDownloadUrl.php to their own servers and return the updates download URL with compromised updates.\n> 3. Based on our logs, we see no other clients hosted on this particular server being targeted. The bad actors specifically searched for https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ domain with the goal to intercept the traffic to your website, as they might know the then-existing Notepad++ vulnerabilities related to insufficient update verification controls.\n> 4. After concluding our research, the investigated security findings were no longer observed in the web hosting systems from the 2nd of December, 2025, and onwards, as:\n>   * We have fixed vulnerabilities, which could have been used to target Notepad++. In particular, we do have logs indicating that the bad actor tried to re-exploit one of the fixed vulnerabilities; however, the attempt did not succeed after the fix was implemented.\n>   * We have rotated all the credentials that bad actors could have obtained until the 2nd of September, 2025.\n>   * We have checked the logs for similar patterns in all web hosting servers and couldn’t find any evidence of systems being compromised, exploited in a similar way, or data breached.\n>\n> While we have rotated all the secrets on our end, below you will find the preventive actions you should take to maximize your security. However, if below actions have been done after the 2nd of December, 2025, no actions are needed from your side.\n>\n> * Change credentials for SSH, FTP/SFTP, and MySQL database.\n> * Review administrator accounts for your WordPress sites (if you have any), change their passwords, and remove unnecessary users.\n> * Update your WordPress sites (if you have any) plugins, themes, and core version, and turn on automatic updates, if applicable.\n> We appreciate your cooperation and understanding. Please let us know in case you have any questions.\n\nGetting a scrollbox for `tt` text instead sure is something.",

The one thing that Windows does really well is the whole concept of [Authenticode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/authenticode), which makes it easy for the average user to know when to trust Windows installations from the internet.  The problem with Notepad++ is that for a long time they did not use Authenticode, and people trusted the binary installs despite the warning from Microsoft.  People felt safe doing it because everyone seemed to use Notepad++, which is exactly what made it such a nice target for state sponsored actors.  It was only starting in October last year that they started using proper digital signatures.\n\nNow don’t start yapping about Linux being better here, that’s just nonsense.  [Linux has had problems too](https://thehackernews.com/2016/02/linux-mint-hack.html), and btw, the Linux Mint compromise shows how futile it is to just post a hash of a binary as a replacement for proper signature checking (the hacker replaced the legitimate hash with the hash of the compromised version).",

He would assign tasks/work and give deadlines. I remember multiple times when I was working on a task, I would come to a proverbial fork in the road and a decision about how to approach the problem would come up that I could see affecting future programming work.\n\nI would meet with him, explain the problem and the different ideas I had to approach it and what I thought the downstream effects would be. I was hoping he could either give me an answer on what approach to take (whether it was one that I already presented or a novel one), or a rule of thumb to use, or really just any guidance so I could finish the task.\n\nInstead, he would waffle on the importance and criticality of making the right decision (which was obvious, that’s why I was there asking him instead of just doing what I personally thought was best) and that I should implement both ways and then gather data on how they worked so that I could make a data driven decision. Except 1) I was mostly worried about issues down the road, not immediate issues. I can’t gather data on future theoretical issues, and 2) it takes much longer to implement both solutions and then test them both than to just choose one. And he was the one who gave me the deadlines in the first place so he should know about them. I guess he expected me to crunch and work late to still meet them.\n\nAnyways, in order to preserve my evenings, weekends and sanity, I stopped asking him these types of questions and just went with the solution I thought was best at the time. Because if an issue ever arose that was caused by my design choice earlier, he couldn’t really blame me for not being able to see the future and anticipate the problem since I had justification for why I designed it the way I did.",

Which can and is totally fine! In the right environment, with the right people.

I'm well liked, and consulted frequently for my expertise and opinion. They want my help as much as possible, and not knowing is *okay* in this environment. I don't have to survive.

AI rushes into coding up something at the first prompt, and you constantly have to explain what it's doing, it doesn't ask for requirements or limitations, or even hint that it should ask for that, it just rushes forward to give you what you want compromising everything else to do it.  \"You don't want to see that message? let's delete the message!\"\n\nWe wouldn't hire someone who did that, why is it ok in our AI. \n\nI keep telling my juniors... don't be afraid to ask questions whether in private or in the middle of a meeting, no one is expecting you to know everything.  Though considered the level.  (Don't ask the CEO what TPM means...)\n\nThat being said, I once had a guy who was two levels higher than me talk my version of him saying \"He doesn't know how to do X\"  I felt so bad, it was a talking to... I then asked around and realized NO ONE at my level knew how to do X because that's not something we did on a daily basis, the ONE guy who said he did basically said \"I know that because I've been on the project for 5 years and have had to do that, most people don't\"...    Yeah that guy made me feel like shit for asking for information... ass.",

It takes some people an awful long time to realize that I’m serious. \n\nIt’s important to be clear when a corner cut is actually temporary. The rule of three plays into this a lot,if you can get it to stick. I worked at a place where we had to fuck IO the Rule of Thee about four times before we stopped trying to “save time” on the third ticket by making the second one longer and try to predict the future. Every week we added to #2 added about a day to #3 instead of taking a week off of it. \n\nSome blogger called himself a code gardener. If you know anything about woody plants, you can’t really make them do anything. You can strongly encourage it, but you have to be patient about it. Making them grow a certain way can take three to five years and all of your 5 Year Plans have to get rewritten every three years anyway. \n\nIn the end you make something that looks like you were being intentional but was a series of compromises every step along the way. This is the “false modesty” you often see with gardeners and some other professions. It’s not false modesty. They know how much went into making accidents look like they were a plan the entire time. What they don’t appreciate is that’s what mastery is. It’s not the skill they thought they would get out of the bargain, but it’s important.",

Humans only seem to do that because they actually have a massive context.\n\nThis is actually a classic example of a problem with AI. When you tell an AI to do something, what prevents it from killing all humans to do it? Nothing inherently, you have to actually train it so that “killing all humans” is a massive negative in the reward function so it doesn’t land on that.\n\nBut then, what prevents it from putting all humans into a coma? You have to add that in too, there’s nothing inherent about a reward function that limits humans in comas as a negative.\n\nThis problem blows up because it turns out, in order to make an AI that actually “does the right thing” you have to encode the entirety of human morality into it up front so it doesn’t land on a choice that involves something horribly unethical. \n\nThis is not trivial and in fact, if AI was smart enough to figure this all out on its own, it would actually be able to turn us all into [paperclips anyway](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/ai-and-paperclip-problem).\n\nI’ll close by saying be careful what you wish for with regards to AI because the optimal solution to your problem most definitely involves killing all humans ",

The programmer will be quiet the whole meeting. Then, at some point the programmer will ask a vague question about what we just discussed and had resolved as a group 5 minutes ago.\n\nFor example, we'll discuss the DB to use for 35 minutes. We figure out that we can't use a simple BigQuery MV for our needs. We figure out the path to a solution which is a bit more complicated, but will work perfectly. We ask if everyone agrees or has ideas of why it might not work. No concerns raised. Even the programmer in question is nodding in approval, which is important because he'll be building this DB and system.\n\nOkay. Decided. We have the plan. Sweet.\n\nThen we start discussing how downstream systems will work with the info, and it's all aligned. Perfect.\n\nOh, Programmer interrupts someone else while they are talking. To ask a question.\n\n\"Where is the information being stored?\"\n\nHuh? We look around. No one knows what he means.\n\n\"So, in order for these downstream systems to use the data, it must be stored somewhere. I know this because I have worked in data for a long time.  You guys are lucky I caught this. Lol. We can't just use data. It has to come from somewhere and then  be stored in order to be queried. We can just use probably BigQuery. That's what I recommend. We should store the data in big query.\"\n\nIt's painful because not only has he not been paying attention this entire meeting, but also the system he works on is BigQuery and ALREADY HAS THE DATA.  We were trying to figure out how to get the data into something that will work for the use cases, which we just discussed and agreed upon. He agreed to it a few minutes ago but he doesn't have any clue what he agreed to.\n\nSo, one by one, he asks the questions which were already discussed in the meeting and the doc outlining the purpose of the meeting and how his own system works.\n\nMultiple hours later, we end up agreeing again to the same system that we had already agreed upon.  The programmer in question agrees to build the system. Again. I offer to create a doc outlining exactly what he agreed to build, if he needs it. He says he doesn't need the doc but would like it anyway, just so others can be on the same page as him. Okay.\n\nI create the doc. It outlines the entire plan we all agreed upon, beginning to end. I give it to programmer. It should take maybe three days. He says it'll take about one. Cool.\n\nThree weeks later, he's done. After heavy pressure from leadership.\n\nFucking A. He ignored the entire doc and created a MV in Big Query that accomplished zero of the use cases and based on the GCP logs, he created the MV one hour after leadership pressured him.\n\nAnd then we have more meetings, and he's asking the exact same questions all over again.",

Occasionally the answer was just \"No reason, I'm just more familiar with this method\", and a couple times it was \"That might actually be a better solution, we should look into it.\"\n\nI was fine with every one of those responses. The problem I've run into on some other teams is that some seniors take personal offense when you question them. But I also came to realize that this is usually because they can't actually answer those questions. As a result, they're usually pretty good at shutting down discussions.\n\nSide note - this is a separate issue from the more systemic issue of people being scared to ask questions because managers interpret questions as incompetence or otherwise use those questions against the person asking them. That's also a common issue, but it affects everyone, not just the juniors.\n\ntl;dr If you want juniors who ask questions, ensure you have seniors who answer them.",

Often by reading existing code, just for the act of reading it, you can find bugs or improvements. Obviously it is a hard sell to tell your boss \"hey we should just read our code\". Refactoring or a rewrite of code is continuation of that reading and understanding, can't refactor what you don't know.\n\n\nHowever, I do find that often re-writes create new bugs because it can very easily mis recreating behavior that was originally a mistake but now other code depends on that incorrect behavior. ",

Fedora has 6-month release cycle so you won't be bothered by version upgrades too often and it's not shipping some day-old drivers with bugs in them, but it's still modern enough so that all the new hardware and whatnot works perfectly.\n\n[Ultramarine Linux](https://ultramarine-linux.org/) is another great option, it's new like Cachy but it's 99.9% Fedora so you're basically getting the stability and support from Fedora. What Ultramarine does better is that it comes with some important stuff pre-installed for you, such as NVIDIA drivers and proprietary media codecs.",

My final OMG moment was as I simply installed Steam and was ready to tinker with Proton/Wine but nothing. Just Steam-install my Windows games and play without hassle (not all run, but >90%). Even VR runs good. If they rtun they run better than under Win 11. Also AI, ComfyUI, Ollama all run so good.

              "text": "I've been extensively studying and testing distros for the last few months, here's my current take (still just my opinion of course):\n\n* **Ubuntu** (and more so **Kubuntu**) is a solid distro in itself, but its parent company Canonical is basically the Microsoft of Linux. They have implemented some weird quirks into Ubuntu, most recently snaps (while the rest of the Linux world is committed to flatpak), and they are very much pushing their own agenda over the community's good. I just feel like once you switch away from Microsoft, why move to the next worst thing?\n* **PopOS** is a weird one. Their COSMIC desktop environment is theoretically crazy good and I can't wait to use it for real, but it's just not quite there yet. One or two more years and I will definitely try PopOS on my gaming rig, but for now I can't really recommend it due to it being in an awkward mixed state between old and new systems. Their dev team is fully focused on COSMIC, but it's not usable for most people yet.\n* **Fedora** is what I would recommend for most people's everyday use, specifically the [KDE Plasma](https://www.fedoraproject.org/kde/) version. Gaming, programming, creative work... basically for any desktop use. It's very much like Ubuntu for everyday use, but RedHat has been much more Linux friendly and user friendly than Canonical. Similar to Ubuntu, it has a 6-month release cycle for that sweet spot between stable and modern.\n* **Ultramarine Linux** is a promising new distro that's basically 99% Fedora but more beginner friendly. It has less post-installation hassle with things like media codecs and NVIDIA drivers pre-installed for you. Worth looking at, although I *personally* prefer sticking with the base distro (Fedora) whenever possible. But that's probably because I'm already familiar with it, if you're new to Linux then [Ultramarine](https://ultramarine-linux.org/) might be the best option there is right now.",

Haven't you followed the recent news regarding closing the code for RHEL? All distro based on it had to do some workarounds to resolve this, it hurt the open-source ecosystem a lot.\n\nAnd as much as I wanted to love Fedora, it is simply not as good as Ubuntu if you are on NVIDIA. The constant kernel and GPU driver updates requires the system to rebuild their versions against each other, leading to a lot of breakages. While on Ubuntu you rarely face this since the versions of things are just \"up to date enough\", rarely forcing rebuilds, and therefore, less breakages.\n\nUltimately I would recommend Fedora only for those who Are not using NVIDIA, unfortunately for me, it is not the case. Once I buy a new PC it'll be full AMD though, so I'll go back to Fedora and maybe abandon Ubuntu for good.",

I set up Headscale and RustDesk for easy remote support (I self-host on a $5/mo VPS that also hosts my personal website) and everyone has been super happy. I'm probably the happiest since if one person notices something is off, I can push out fixes to everyone using Ansible. Saves me a bunch of time.\n\nAs always with Linux, there's a little jank. Chrome didn't correctly associate its windows with the KDE tray icon, [so I helped convince the flatpak maintainers](https://github.com/flathub/com.google.Chrome/pull/483) to [merge a PR that would fix it](https://github.com/flathub/com.google.Chrome/pull/474). Similarly, Dropbox didn't detect the home directory correctly and required a manual workaround, [so I opened an issue and PR to get that fixed, too](https://github.com/flathub/com.dropbox.Client/issues/392). The beauty of open source on display.\n\nOf course there's all sorts of other jank I can't fix myself. Questionable interface decisions in KDE. Some AppStreams randomly don't work in Discover (e.g. Dolphin extensions, so no Dropbox sync indicators!). The software development story in containers is not as straightforward as one would hope and CUDA passthrough is still annoying.\n\nThe biggest headache, however, was installing the proprietary Nvidia drivers on my personal computer. There is no way to exaggerate how insane the process is. On a Secure Boot and/or LUKS-encrypted system, it's not enough to layer the akmod-nvidia and xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda packages, oh no. You must also generate a Machine Owner Key, enroll it, and then generate a small rpm package to shim that key into ostree. Then you have to manually configure dracut to load the drivers early enough for the LUKS prompt, which slows down updates by needing to renegerate the initrd. [Here's a guide I found invaluable](https://github.com/Comprehensive-Wall28/Nvidia-Fedora-Guide).\n\nIf you have a Nvidia GPU, I'd suggest looking at the more batteries-included Project Bluefin distros (Bazzite, Aurora, etc.). Take this with a grain of salt since I haven't tried them myself. For Intel or AMD, I'd recommend using vanilla Fedora for its stronger community and more storied history (i.e. I trust it more).\n\nAll that said, none of us miss Windows in the slightest.",

TL;DR: I really enjoy the workflow so far, especially the idea of keeping my toolchains separate from everything else via distrobox. Of course you don't *need* to be on Bazzite/Aurora/Bluefin to use distrobox, but it really fits the theme of the entire OS well.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't know if I'd just blindly recommend it to other devs. I'd say read up on the idea of atomic/immutable distros first, and if it sounds interesting enough then definitely give it a test drive on a separate drive or partition. I don't think it's too big of a change IMO, but you also can't just blindly `dnf install ruby` or whatever like you'd usually do, either.\n\nFor your regular Joe User that just needs the basics though? I can seriously see this being the future. Updates are dead simple and have almost no chance of completely trashing your system.

I can just boot up a Linux install image and it'll find my network hardware and everything on my system will just work.\n\n\nWell, except the nvidia drivers. I have to add a non-free repo to my debian system and apt install the nvidia-driver. Every once in a while a kernel update will forget to recompile the nvidia kernel modules, so I have to kick those off by hand. That's just the first thing I do now if I run an update and my second monitor isn't working when I reboot, and it always fixes it.\n\n\nI haven't tried my entire steam library yet, but every steam game that I have tried so far just works in Linux, as easily as it would in Windows. A far cry from the Loki Games days where there were 5 or 6 games being manually ported to Linux. I have not ever been able to keep World of Warcraft consistently running on my Linux system. I might be able to get it working until I do a kernel update or Blizzard does a client update. So your mileage may vary if you do a lot of online gaming. But the scene is *very good* right now.",

Probably doing the best out of the euro big three Amiga/ST/Archie, even though the Archie was a distant 3rd in Europe back in the day. https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads\n\nAtari ST TOS/GEM effectively went open too, and while Amiga people looked down on it at the time, actually toward the end became arguably more powerful than AmigaOS in some ways (being e.g. further along in adding memory protection) https://freemint.github.io/\n\nGEOS became New Deal Office / Geoworks became Breadbox. It actually got somewhat open sourced too https://bluewaysw.github.io/pcgeos/ \n\nClassic-MacOS is really a very different OS to OS X (which is really NeXtStep descendant... Unfortunately Apple dropped the X recently, so I've been calling it Step-MacOS when I need to distinguish), though OS X did include a something of a source-compat api GUI layer (carbon).\n\nPsion [tiny-laptop-like PDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_\\(company\\)#/media/File:2005-04-16_Psion_Serie_5mx_PRO_24MB_beschn_unscharf_scharf.JPG) OS EPOC32 eventually became SymbianOS that became very widely used on (mostly non-US) nearly-smart gsm + java mobile devices for ages just before Android/iOS. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian\n\nThe QNX/Neutrino Photon microGUI again saw mostly embedded/mobile device use but QNX is still about today, and Photon was interesting architecturally https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/6.4.1/neutrino/sys_arch/photon.html#GRAPHMICROK.  It's the one that did the \"one floppy disk web browser\" gui desktop with web browser demo back in the day. http://toastytech.com/guis/qnxdemo.html\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8kQzKCn7lE .  At one stage QNX was lined up to be the Amiga-branded successor to AmigaOS proper, but that deal collapsed totally. https://www.osnews.com/story/11034/how-qnx-failed-the-amiga/\n\nAnd then over in Japan they had their own stuff, like the GUI desktop for Sharp X68000s SX-Window on the Human68k OS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SX-Window\n\n\n>  There are easily 15 or 20 different window managers to choose from\n\nYes, it is case that the GUI widget toolkits, window managers / desktop environments and display servers (X11, Wayland) can be somewhat decoupled from the OS overall, though that's most common in Unix/Linux/BSD land... it also can apply somewhat elsewhere e.g. AmigaOS had 3rd party Scalos and Directory Opus and 1st party Workbench Desktop Environments, 1st party Intuition and 3rd party MUI and ClassAct GUI toolkits (until ClassAct became part of the OS later as ReAction), and [VMS/OpenVMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS) also ran X11 CDE while being not really a Unix.  (while VMS isn't popular now, it still exists, and famously Microsoft Windows NT (WNT...) is also suspiciously strongly VMS influenced because Cutler - try going to the next letter in the alphabet...).\n\nLinux and the BSDs / Unixes often run the same display servers and GUI toolkits and are architecturally similar generally.  You thus won't have a hugely different desktop experience from Linux on a FreeBSD or DragonflyBSD given a particular GUI Desktop Environment, but they are different OSes.  But you have KDE  (built with Qt), GNOME ( built with Gtk+), XFCE / Gtk+, Enlightenment (EFL/Elementary), etc. etc.",

Why not?\"  \"Well... \" I say, \"I suppose I could, but this nice lady here is bending me into unnatural shapes right now, and I might say things that HR won't like...\"\n* A coworker with kidney disease.... \"They want to know why I can't fly to an offsite for a day event...  I said I could if I had my own restroom or people didn't mind the bag\"\n* My employer had strike duty -- they tried to put on a boom truck -- given I'm blind, I protested.  It took an outside source and and lawyer to explain this might be a bad idea... but the press would love it.\n* A coworker in the same strike duty -- they wanted her to climb poles.  She agreed, but only if she could drop wrenches on our CEO.  I had to explain it wasn't the loss of the CEO that was the problem -- we could always get a new one -- but the wrenches were expensive.\n* My employer had a team building event somewhere, and we were all supposed to drive there, and policy said I couldn't order car service.  They INSISTED I had to drive myself.  I tried to explain.  Finally, I offered \"Sure!  It's a rental -- I'll even pay the CDW.  I wonder if I'll make it out of the parking lot before I total the car.  By the way, I have no license.\"\n* Years ago, my VPs of engineering were gems.  I say that, because the first just went to Burning Man one day, and never returned.  The second, his replacement, who was supposed to be better, was a Harold Camping (sp?) fan.  Thus, he believed, the world was going to end in 1994.  He told everyone too.   I was on good terms with the CFO so he asked \"Well, I guess I don't need to pay him anymore, or do we havea. company lockout -- I don't know...\"\n\nStrangely enough, this happens again and again.....  One of my most favorite ones was an offsite picnic -- one of those you'd better attend and have fun OR ELSE.   We're there -- a small child comes up to our CEO and runs away in tears \"Mommy!  He's dead!  He looks like Lurch!\"  I had nothing to do with this!",

We were using the same type and schema for two related things which, up until my most recent ticket, had exactly the same shape. When they suddenly had different requirements the change ended up rippling across way more of the system than intended.\n\nThe approach I’ve outlined for the future is that, when sharing types amongst different usages, it’s essential to determine whether the similarity between the types is a **coincidence** or whether it’s an **invariant**. When it’s an invariant, tight coupling is acceptable. When it’s a coincidence, tight coupling is undesirable. A single snapshot of the system is not usually enough to tell you which of these you are dealing with; these are properties of how systems evolve over time.",

If there’s one thing I want to convince the industry of is optional fields are evil (although very occasionally a necessary one). Too often people use them to avoid having to properly model their data. What I tell people is every time you do that, you’re pushing that business logic somewhere deep inside your application code. If you do that 30-40 times suddenly your codebase is a mess that’s impossible to reason about. \n\nDon’t create a data model where num_vertebrae is optional, and if it’s not defined then have some logic deep inside your code to say the animal is an invertebrate. Directly model vertebrates and invertebrates separately that way anyone reading in the tables will understand that businesses logic.",

It is an indicator of a more denormalized data model.

I guess now you have isManager and isAdmin, but is it sensible to have a user which is an admin and *not* a manager?\n\nOr maybe you want to say isCancelled.  Ok.  If things are only ever cancelled or not cancelled, you will not regret this choice.  If you ever allow a thing to become uncanceled as part of a retry state, you will quickly find yourself managing multiple orthogonal fields.\n\nIt's fine say \"keep it simple\" if you are certain that your field exists in exactly two states and that will never, ever chance.\n\nNote that binary methods, which validate if you are in X state or not in X state, are probably fine.  Especially if \"cancelled by user\" and \"cancelled because too many retries\" are multiple states something can be in.\n\nBesides, if you have a state field which only has ACTIVE and CANCELLED, and you never actually go beyond those two states, what exactly do you lose?  A few bytes IF the field is properly packed?  The benefit of simplicity just isn't worth the future cost, IMO.  You don't get that much simplicity, DB field migration is the least fun kind of refactor.\n\nI'm pretty sure you can find \"don't use boolean fields\" articles at *least* twenty years old, for both DB fields and method params, so this is one of those lessons I suspect every generation will learn the hard way.\n\nOf course some, who have jumped from industry to industry, never maintaining their legacy code, will never learn it.",

Those are immediately stress-tested, researched, expanded, and clarified by the agent.\n\nActing as the driver has made me a better planner, engineer, and communicator. I still reject ideas when they are wrong, but that critical evaluation is now formalized in the updated plan instead of in my head. The result so far is work that is better thought out, better implemented, and significantly easier to explain to others. Overall, it’s leading to sturdier designs and fewer downstream corrections. So far anyway!\n\nI am still very cautious and I don’t give it full access by any means. Everything is still vetted by my eyes, and I always make sure to understand every concept it builds.

You know, the bus factor and such.\n\nAnd in my experience, LLMs are not very good in maintaining codebases. You need a strong mental model for that, and also knowledge of what's happening outside of the codebase, and a human is way better at all of that any LLMs, at least for now.\n\nYou should (re)read The Mythical Man-Month.",

They cost a few hundred dollars (back in the day) per seat and were highly profitable. Software companies made money off of other companies' software development. (personally, I bought Turbo C++ for $150 in 1992)\n\nOpen source changed that and most software development tools don't generate revenue (yes, Visual Studio, Oracle's Java, and embedded tools still cost money, but they're the outliers). Sure, I'll pay for a library every now and then, but I always have the choice not to.\n\nNow, imagine the case where you took something that cost everyone nothing but their time and found a way to charge them every time they did it. Not just for the tools or hardware, but every single action generated revenue for you, whether or not it saved them any time or effort. \n\nIt's like if Fender decided to charge me per note I played while offering suggestions for the next riff. Useful for ideation? Probably. Something that should be baked into how I play guitar or I risk getting kicked out of the band? Definitely not.\n\nOr if Intel decided to rent me cycles on their CPUs rather than let me own them... ;)\n\nAI autocomplete and code generation in general is currently a hell of a drug. The first hits are free but there's a possible future where you won't be able to write a line of code without paying an AI tax on it. Do we want that future?",

So there's a simple optimisation curve with cost of engineer time vs cost of llm time, and there will be an optimum on the curve that maximises code while minimising cost (assuming quality/docs are equal in either case for simplicity).\n\n> Or if Intel decided to rent me cycles on their CPUs rather than let me own them... ;)\n\npeople have been trying to push cloud gaming for several years!",

Really disappointing.",

Must have 256GB Ram and minimum 8 cores or it will run slow; this was pre-covid times. \n\nfelt weird but eh.. we'll see later, so we provision the server. overtime it slowed to a crawl with number of employees growing. HR started complaining that we might have to migrate out or have another server instance and move some employees to a different entity... etc.. \n\nand for shit sake.. I decided to RDP in and have a look, while calling the support team. The server barely had ram or cpu load. ram was like less than 14GB and cpu was mostly 1-2% usage. \n\nIn processes list, they were running SQL express. I asked the support tech why sql express and if they are aware it's limited to 1GB of ram.. apparently that's why they picked it. Because it wouldn't use more than 1 GB of ram. \n\nfuck it.. let's see what's SQL is doing .. turns out it was mostly executing a stored procedure... pull it up.. \n\nFUCK.. it was a mega store procedure.. no it was the entire business logic store procedure. \n\na 1200+ line store procedure that was mostly pulling data into variables and \"If/else\" all inside a single transaction/commit. along with old code commented out. \n\n  \nI closed it. No amount of ram/cpu could save it.",

Thing is - it does not have to be disproved in practice, it only needs to retain the possibility of being disproved if certain evidence is ever found. The fact that such evidence is not actually found (especially when actively sought) serves to affirm our belief in that theory.\n\nWith that in mind - a good code may be easy to delete, but as long as it's not actually deleted we know it's good _and relevant_ code (because it's still needed in the codebase)",

It helps me understand and follow things.

We own them, but no urgent development is needed for them.\n\nTo keep things fresh, it’s multiple services running on top of  micro size instances of managed postgres in AWS. AWS has this nice feature where you can buffer disk I/O credits and cpu credits from when you need them, so can have the occasional heavy query still getting executed fairly fast. \n\nOn top of that they have made a bunch of terrible database crimes that cause full table scans all the time. As long as the tables are small enough, they stay cached in ram, queries are still fast enough and everything looks fine. \n\nOnce those table grow big enough though, each query causes part of the table to get evicted from ram, causing a bit of I/O on disk. \n\nInitially it just uses part of the buffer during office hours and then the buffer refills. \n\nThen people working late start getting timeouts because the buffer is empty. After they stop working for a bit, and report it is down, it starts responding again.\n\nThen things start timing out during the late afternoon working hours, but redeploying things helps. And when you check things out in the morning, everything runs fine.\n\nBefore x-mas we took a closer look at one of the services, and found a routine that look for things added in the last 5 mins, but the timestamp column doesn’t have an index on it, so it needs to scan the entire log table.\n\nThis week another of these services started doing the same thing, so we immediately looked at the database. The entire service consists of storing ‘items’ with their ‘itemlines’.\n\nBrainiac A decided that a many-to-many relation was the right implementation for this. \n\nBrainiac B decided that when you need to lookup all itemslines by item id, the correct way was to go though all the item lines, join them to the item-to-itemlines table, and then filter out any itemlines where the item id on the item-to-itemlines entity didn’t match the item id you are looking for. There is a covering index on the item-to-itemline table that would solve this with a lookup, but they managed to write the C# code in a way that ensured that EF didn’t use it by accident.",

How long is the wait for each update? I'd expect waiting for a single update on any reasonable configuration to take like at most 2ms or something of that order, or say 500 updates per second. Not great, but it'd work. Even if we'd assume much worse performance at 50 updates per second, why would that take 5+ minutes? Do they really need to update 50 x 5 x 60 = 15,000 users? Or is there any reason a simple user update takes about 20ms?\n\nGiven that the bulk operation completed in 300ms I'd say there's probably something else going on that slowed the updates in that loop and that the loop was just the place where it had the biggest visible impact",

Thousands of lines of code.\n\nBut it was the very first part that caught my attention - it took a batch of records, and then did ‘foreach ( Record record in batch ) new Thread(handleRecord, record).start() ‘.\n\nIn other words, it spun up one thread for each record in the batch, of which there could be hundreds or even thousands. I’m sure it worked fine for the guy’s three-record test code, and then choked on real data.\n\nI replaced it with ‘ThreadPool.start’ and it went from fifteen minutes to about thirty seconds.

It was a simple fix but nobody had thought to try the UI with anything other than toy-data and the code review didn't catch the wildly inefficient design.\n\nThe exec's were thrilled with the miraculous fix and I was a hero. :-)",

In my opinion the people who think that what agents produce is 'good enough' are the people who have no love for the craft at all and just quite simply don't care. 'As long as it works I don't give a damn' type of folks. But if you're anything like me, someone who really cares about the quality of their work, and about their own personal growth at the craft, it's all kinds of gross.\n\nPersonally I've decided that LLMs are great learning tools, being able to not only search for information but ask questions, bounce around ideas, describe things and get them automatically expanded upon or summarised, etc, is very handy. It's now an additional tool in my toolbox along with various docs, websites, books, youtube channels, etc. If I need to learn a new language, it is very handy to be able to ask it something like, 'Show me a simple Hello World in this language and explain each line'. I think that's a good use for the tech.\n\nAnd for coding tasks, if I use an LLM for actual code it's for what you said, small discrete tasks. A template of something, a single function, a test, etc. Or simple text edits. \"Translate all the English words in this HTML into French\" \"Generate a simple CMake Template with these requirements: \" \"Write a function to convert an RGB colour to a HSL colour\", etc. Small tasks, so I can review the results, adjust them if needed, and add them to a project.\n\nI'm always watching the output carefully, and also trying to keep the number of times I use it somewhat low. I'll use it for speeding up tedious tasks that offer me no great learning experience when I'm on the clock, but if I got the time to do something myself, and it's 'actual proper coding work' that could help me personally keep growing my skills or at least practice something I haven't done for a while, I'd rather do that myself. All skills are perishable, you use them or lose em, I don't want to rely to LLMs to the point that I start to forget how to write code.\n\nAnd if that makes me 'old man yells at cloud.jpg' then fine, I don't care.\n\nI look at some folks who talk about letting coding agents go ham on their whole repositories, even doing commits, writing absolutely everything, with no guard rails, generating stuff that's full of technical debt, bugs, and not giving a damn, spinning in their chair while the water supply of an entire lake is consumed by a data centre somewhere generating tens of thousands of lines of junk code, while they don't bother to learn a single thing at all about coding and I just think... if that's what being a developer means in the future, I'm going to have to start introducing myself as something less embarrassing, like maybe a used cars salesman, or drug dealer.",

It feels like progress because nothing's slowing you down. \n\nBut nothing's checking you either.\n\nOne thing that's helped me: before accepting complex AI code, I ask it to explain what it wrote back to me. Not as a test for the AI. As a test for me. If I can't follow the explanation, I don't understand the code well enough to own it.\n\nSounds obvious. But when you're in the \"just 5 more minutes\" loop, you skip it. You accept because it looks right and the tests pass.\n\nThe abstraction bloat thing is real too. AI will scaffold 1,000 lines where 100 would do. You have to actively push back—\"couldn't you just...\"—and it immediately simplifies. But if you don't ask, it won't offer.

There's SLOs, but those often have a bit of a narrow definition of uptime and they have diminishing returns (plus uptime isn't really the same as correctness).\n\nBugs are hard to enumerate. Most bugs are super specific and won't affect most people. They vary wildly in size, severity, cost, how long they take to get fixed, importance, etc. Companies don't want to publish details about most of their bugs, as it'd be unnecessarily embarrassing and generally make things seem worse than they arguably are. Point being that it can be really tricky to compare the correctness between two different products. Uptime doesn't tell the whole picture. I'm not sure there even is a better approach than getting genuine feedback from a number of users, and even then, that's fairly biased. The seller *will* tell you about the ways that their software does better than the competition, but they'll also omit the ways it does worse and they might cherrypick benchmarks or fail to mention big asterisks on them.",

If you fire the whole QA department, the software won't automatically break the next day or the next week. There is resiliency built-in, there are test pipelines etc, it will take months before issues start to creep-in, and even longer before it starts to really impact sales and revenue.

It's not unlikely that such management will be long gone before the delayed penalty for their decisions actually resurface.\n\nI've also seen a case where development and maintenance were split between two managers. Not hard to guess that \"development manager\" would push to ship everything as fast as possible, with zero testing, because the maintenance and bugfixing was not his problem.

Quality and speed is a false trade off beyond a month or so.\n\nThe original post has a rather expansive definition of quality that includes how intuitive things are for users.  That seems reasonable for it to be a product call, as usually they can evaluate that with similar insight as an engineer.\n\nWhat they can't assess easily is the quality of the code base.  But often engineers speak of quality as something separate from business value.  It's not: as Martin Fowler points out, quality allows you to build faster and with fewer bugs.  The difficulty is that it's often hard to directly measure and you may have to use strong anecdotes and some degree of trust.  But there are projects where you can measure fairly directly: pipeline velocity, defects per engineer per month, and such.\n\nSometimes I use sharpening the axe as an analogy.  Yeah, maybe I can bludgeon the next tree down and maybe even faster than it would take for me to sharpen my axe and cut this one tree down.  But I know you want me to deal with the whole forest and it will be faster if you let me sharpen my axe first.\n\nAI has been interesting and you might be able to use enthusiasm for it to your advantage.  AI rarely gets it right at first and benefits from fast iteration cycles and extensive test coverage with useful feedback.  It also benefits from good documentation and names that make sense.",

So there's not much you can do at that point, because the changes you're making are usually quite small.\n\nThe other problem is that the few times that you might be asked to build a new system from scratch, often the deadline is really rushed for some reason. For maintaining old code, often the deadlines are quite relaxed or non-existent, but for building a new project from scratch, managers always seem to want really clear timelines and then they check in with you constantly and basically apply a lot of pressure. Maybe part of it is that they know that maintenance development is less desirable, so they feel compelled to treat you nicer, whereas new development is more desirable so they feel like they can pressure you more without you leaving. Idk.\n\nAnd the final issue is that on these new projects, often your teammates will sort of go insane, they may have never really gotten the chance to write much code from scratch, so they almost go into this mania where they're writing tons and tons of code, like the sheer act of typing in the code is the goal for them and they create these super verbose codebases with tons of boilerplate, pointless tests, every wacky abstraction they read about in a book, every obscure language or framework feature, etc. It's almost an orgy of coding where the codebase just explodes with thousands and thousands of lines of this stuff.",

What's the issue?\" The bigger the company the more efficiently and perversely it will optimise for max Y in unintended ways.  \n  \nThe example that always sticks with me is London in the early 2000s, when the government was under pressure to reduce the abysmal lengths of time people were waiting in A&E (ER) before being triaged/seen by doctors. So they introduced a target: hospitals would be rewarded based on the proportion of people arriving at A&E who were seen, treated and discharged within a four-hour window. The aim being more efficient hospitals and better public opinion. A couple of ways in which hospitals made progress towards the goal that are arguably unintended: \n\n* Cancelling non-urgent operations so that extra staff could work in A&E when performance was being measured (increasing waiting times for elective surgery across the board).\n* Keeping patients just outside A&E in ambulances so that they didn't technically \"arrive\" until the hospital was confident that they could meet the target (leading to increased ambulance response times).\n* A near doubling of the number of patients who happened to be discharged from the hospital within the last 20 minutes of the window.

The metric in that case was the amount of time between when an order was finalized - ie when the cashier collected the money - and when it was cleared off the order screen. This was intended to measure the amount of time it took to fulfill the order, but of course we figured out pretty quickly that nothing stopped us from clearing the order whenever the hell we wanted to.\n\nWas always fun getting praise from the owner when he'd drop by.",

One classic case is parking norms scaled to handle black friday parking, which means that even on the one most bonkers day of the year there's still capacity _in the parking lot_ (what goes on inside the store is someone else's problem), and the remaining 364 days of the year, the parking lot is grossly oversized and underutilised, and in some cases the parking lot winds up being so big that people spend more time walking between their car and the store than people do between their home and the shop in a walkable urban neighbourhood.\n\nOr scaling highways to be able to deal with holiday traffic, which then either leads to them being oversized the rest of the year, or induced demand, which eats away the gains (and a lot of other stuff).\n\nAt least in software there's _some_ awareness around setting goals for stuff like p50, p90 and so on, and that wanting too many nines comes with its own costs.",

It's a perfect strategy to fail upward. I'm not saying all of them do it, but a lot of them do. The ones who are mostly immune to this are those that start out with a technical degree (engineering, medical etc.) before getting into business, or have a very high ethical standards.\n\nEvery company I've been thru, I have had experience with new executives stepping in and trying to make their mark by cutting off \"non-essential\" benefits, then dealing with the inevitable turnover of skilled workers by hiring cheap young new graduates or offshoring, and then boom, their career-defining achievement is lowering operating costs by 30+% while coasting on existing revenue. And then after they got their bonuses, they got \"headhunted\" to fuck off out of there before the company loses steam and fail.\n\nAnytime I hear someone mentioning KPI in my field (software engineering), I know it's a red flag. \"Metrics\" or \"indicators\" are fine on their own, but as soon as I hear \"performance\" or \"predictive\" along with them, I know it's 90% chance of being bullshit and what's gonna follow is a bunch of shallow, shortsighted superficial solutions that add more burden to whatever the root cause was.",

How do you measure the value of not having a nuclear war? What is the value of not having the building on fire? What is the cost of having a down time? And if only 1 part of the system fails, how do we know it is going to cascade down without simulation? \n\nThe cost of such measurements are essentially also exponential in nature. It is nice sentiment I share with you. But finding an effect system to have some semblance of measurement of this is the real challenge.\n\nThere are options of using no measurements, but if we take time to explain to others who understand the system and measure the value of it, we would also create  extra work no one wants to do. And not having metrics for performance brings another set of problems as well.\n\nPractically having a standardized system that measures the value of individual is really the core of the issue in alot of our endeavors.\n\nAfter some thoughts, I am wondering if we look at things from another perspective, why is that engineer so valued? I think the reason why there is so much reward for the 'fixer' hero, is because systematic understanding is rare. And real time diagnostics is also a rare skill, because organization typically under invest in up keeping a real time documentation system for internal usage, and we do not test our systems under simulated failures enough.

And if the business did agree on that value/it was successful, that's a huge success you should absolutely be able to track and add to the engineer's performance review.  To be honest this is how I usually see promotions happening, when companies reward firefighters it's usually more reflected in bonuses/raises rather than title, it's something that gets a lot of kudos in the moment but what gets you up the ladder is a series of projects that didn't spontaneously combust.\n\nPart of the perception issue might just be that firefighters usually have to put in more time than anticipated, whereas if you're making good architectural decisions you can work smart rather than hard.  If making a safe building is already on the roadmap, you don't really get to claim you went above and beyond unless you took ownership setting the roadmap.",

Measurable upstream impact.\n- **Post-mortems that celebrate prevention.** 'We had zero incidents in Q3 because  refactored the payment service proactively.' Same spotlight, different behavior.\n\nThe hardest part is changing what gets discussed in 1:1s and promoted in calibration. If managers only surface crisis responses, that's what gets optimized for. If they surface 'Alice eliminated an entire category of bugs' with equal enthusiasm, behavior shifts.\n\nThe real test: what stories do people tell new hires about who's successful here?",

Sometimes those comments are straight up \"this doesn't even work at all\". Though the most useful comments are the ones that catch subtle issues that might cause a problem that may evade detection until the change hits prod.\n\nSome people seem to treat code review as if you just skim the code for blatant badness, rather than genuinely understand the code. As well, sometimes people seem to only review the code in the literal sense of the changes only, without considering the big picture implications of how it interacts with the rest of the system. For example, I have some areas of my codebase that must be reentrant (as the code must be able to resume when it gets interrupted), yet it's common for authors to write code that is not reentrant and for reviewers to fail to consider it.\n\nOf course, ideally code would have as few gotchas as possible, have CI systems to ensure it's safe, etc, but it's impossible/infeasible to cover everything, so human reviewers need to be good.",

          "text": "I mean the answer is super, super easy:\n\nFirst of all #1, because all the other problems are at least alleviated with decent management.\n\nSecond turnover. Because one key factor is the theory built between people. If we keep switching people around, or we keep switching targets, or teams or goals, it gets hard to get good at anything, or get any vision of where you are doing. You begin to to thrash, stumble, flail and then burn out as you never see anything you do have success, you never get closure and never leave the stress fight-flight.\n\nFinally impossible dead lines. Note that I am fine with impossible dead lines as long as everyone agrees they're impossible. Moon-shots or stuff like that. Where the goal isn't to achieve it, but to see how much you can achieve. Honestly timeboxing tasks into time way too short to finish it, but enough to get a gist of it being worth to invest the whole time or not is super useful. But I'll take it for what it probably is meant as: impossible *expectations*. That's just setting yourself up for failure and frustration. You may do the most amazing thing you've ever done in your career, and you'll have someone listing how it felt short (even if no one else would ever have gotten closer) that's just deflating. If we celebrate how far we made it, then I can be inspired to push a little bit further just to see where we can end up.\n\nAI is a tool, you use it or not. If it scares you, that's fine, it's a scary moment where we need to rethink our careers. But it's part of the ever changing world of tech. The only issue is if you're being forced to use it, or forced to use it in bad ways, but that isn't AI, that's *bad management*. Toxic Coworkers are a pain, but you can avoid them and let them sink on their own, the only issue is when you're forced to deal with a toxic coworker in a toxic manner and are forced to not use any recourse against the situation, but that isn't the toxic worker, that's *toxic management*. So again, really bad management is the core issue (because impossible deadlines are bad management, and turnover is a management strategy).",

              "text": "In my experience the issue is *every single time* a misunderstanding and abuse of inheritance and the *\"is-a\"* relationship, including with OP's example. They start off with the \"you should model real world\" rule and then they fail to do so and then blame the tool.\n\nThe problem is that just because something *is* something else **in the English spoken language** doesn't mean that it *physically is* that thing as well. For example: My coffee mug *is* red in everyday spoken language, but in reality my coffee mug itself isn't the color \"red\", rather its surface material *has a* color attribute with the value of red. \"Is-a\" vs \"has-a\" is a surprisingly good rule when tackled from the *physics* point of view and not from the English language pov.\n\nIn OP's case the blog post starts off with \"both employees and managers are humans, so let's create a Human base class\" which is already terribly wrong. When a new company hires me, or when I simply change my position in a company, I don't suddenly physically morph into an entity of a different class in the real world. No, I'm the exact same human being and simply my *role within a company* changed. When modeling the real world I'm still a human and not some worker entity, my work isn't my identity.\n\nA better way would be to have a Human class with a *roles* attribute, and both Employee and Manager would be *roles*. Then you could just change `someHuman.roles.insert(new Manager())` or whatever.\n\n**But even that is incorrect,** because physically and biologically a human being doesn't have a list of \"work roles\" when it's born, rather it's a flexible being that can do any number of various tasks at various times. No, it's actually the *company* that cares about my role:\n\n    class Human {\n        Date birthDay\n        Decimal height\n    }\n    \n    class Company {\n        // Just one way to model it, but now these can contain duplicates.\n        List<Human> employees\n        List<Human> managers\n    }\n\nThere, problem solved.\n\nNow this is often overkill and you notice that you don't actually want to model the real world too accurately because it would lead into a lot of extra work and code (because real world ~~is complex~~ has high complexity), but at that point you need to draw proper domain boundaries and not blame OOP for your bad choices.\n\nFor example, from an accounting perspective you don't actually care if the workers are humans in the first place, for all you care they could be aliens or robots. What you really care about are the *contracts* and *identification* (like SSN) and the *roles within the company*. At this point there is zero reason to try to model a biological *Human* into your code anymore, and thus you once again get rid of the inheritance problem.\n\n**TL;DR:** It's not the tool that's broken, it's the users.",

          "text": "I see a number of people in this comment thread saying that this post was too long for them to read, and was going to say something along the lines of “if developers really can’t make it through something of this length without ChatGPT then we really are all doomed”, but… this legitimately was kind of hard to read. The author’s “prickly” attitude and eagerness to trash on reasonable concepts aren’t doing the post any favors.\n\nAside from the style, the contents of the post provide pretty mediocre advice. \n\nWe all know that overuse of inheritance hierarchies is bad. That’s nothing new. Neither is the idea that one should wait until there are multiple examples of code being used before trying to generalize them.\n\nWhat’s unusual in here is the idea that good code is code which has been compressed as much as possible. An interesting idea! Which I have seen go wrong many times.\n\nThe approach of removing duplication wherever possible often leads to tight coupling between conceptually different things. Textual similarity between multiple pieces of code is not a good enough reason alone to try to unify them under a single abstraction, because things which have been unified in this way are now coupled. Uncoupling them later if the need arises is frequently harder than if they were never combined at all. To borrow a phrase, “No abstraction is better than the wrong abstraction.”\n\nHow do you know when this unification should be performed? By thinking about the concepts behind the code. What forces are in play, what the code _means_, how the code has evolved up until this point, what your project manager has in your backlog, etc. This doesn’t mean preemptively building a framework to account for all of these things; it means deferring decisions which are hard to undo unless you have a reason to believe that they won’t need to be undone. This is exactly the kind of thinking that the post is mocking.\n\nFinally,\n\n> The fallacy of “object-oriented programming” is exactly that: that code is at all “object-oriented”. It isn’t. Code is procedurally oriented, and the “objects” are simply constructs that arise that allow procedures to be reused.\n\nThis is laughable and expresses an extremely limited perspective on the wide range of ways which code can be structured and understood.",

There's an impedance between real world language, concepts and terms used by domain experts, and the computer world, made of abstraction written in other languages, with other kinds of constraints. OOP helps you lower the impedance, helps developers map the real world into objects that represent and behave like real objects, so that they can lower the effort when they have to translate the needs of users and domain experts into code and vice versa. OOP in a far more \"high level\" approach than a set of technical patterns and way of working (bear in mind, OOP I'm talking to is the original idea from Alan Kay: cells with an internal, protected state that exchange messages)",
