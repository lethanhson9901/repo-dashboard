That being said, I lost a lot of trust in them after buying a very expensive ProArt monitor from them a few years ago.\n\nThe technical support has been so bad. I quickly found that their monitor’s USB-C connection worked inconsistently, barely at all, on Mac. It simply would seemly stop recognizing the monitor day to day. \n\nSo did what any technical person would. Searched around for similar issues. Found plenty. Searched for driver updates, they had a few. What’s this? Their driver support documents are written in unintelligible broken-English? *sigh* okay, I’ll work that out myself.\n\nWhat’s this? The driver update requires downloading an .exe file? I have a Mac. Fine, whatever, I’ll set it up to my PC at home. What’s this? I have to connect it specifically via the monitor’s USB-C port?! My Windows PC is old and doesn’t have that connection. FINE, I’ll buy the damn converter cable. *Installs driver update*. Yay, it works! For a day :( \n\nReport the issue to ASUS. Wait a year or 2. A new driver update is available! It’s specifically for fixing USB-C issues on Mac!!! Holy Moly! Oh right, I need a windows PC again, ugh. Wait, what’s this? They changed their update method? I can use a USB drive and plug it into the monitor? How futuristic! *struggles though more poorly written instructions* Update done.\n\n*Connect Mac to monitor* - nothing.\n\nSeriously? Do all the usual troubleshooting. Turn off, turn on. Check monitor driver version…yup, it’s the new one.\n\n*continue troubleshooting*. Still failing.\n\n*Accidentally knock Mac’s power cable off laptop* … *ProArt monitor turns on*\n\nWait, what?! It’s working?! No, it couldn’t be…could it? *Plugs in power cable. Monitor goes off* naaah, no way. *unplugs. Monitor goes back on*. Are you shitting me? The issue is seems to be you can’t use the Mac power plugged in at the same time as you’re connecting to the monitor via USB-C. *sigh* A simple workaround for this one, I just won’t plug in the power, after all, the monitor does provide power to the Mac via USB-C…so it’s not really necessary for me keep it plugged in.\n\nAnyways, that’s my story.",

          "text": "My last gaming laptop was an Asus ROG Zephyrus M (GM501GS). I thought I loved it until I started experiencing odd shit happening all the time, like major frequent USB issues. I recently replaced it with a Lenovo Legion Slim 5 Gen 9 and fucking love this laptop. Lenovo Legion > Asus ROG!\n\nI also have an ASUS motherboard in my gaming PC. Have had nothing but problems with it as well. I swear, they don't do any fucking QA with their BIOS releases. After owning this motherboard for nearly 3 years now, they finally pushed a new BIOS that allows me to restart my damn computer successfully. Previously it would hang on a black screen and I'd have to hold the power button to kill it and start it back up manually.\n\nMy routers are also all ASUS routers. Their router firmware is the shittiest firmware I've ever seen; especially the 3006 firmware. I thought the 3004 firmware was dogshit, as simply renaming a device causes all AI mesh routers to just disappear, reassigning all devices on my network to the main router. I have to reboot every device manually for the AI Mesh to resolve itself again. Then they released the 3006 firmware which added a very shitty VLAN solution. If you have AI Mesh nodes, DO NOT ENABLE VLAN OR GUEST NETWORK. It will fuck your shit up! I fought with this 3006 firmware through 3 or 4 different updates and it's still a pile of dogshit. How the hell they thought this 3006 firmware was production release ready is beyond me. If I coded this slop with my job, I would have been out on my ass a long time ago. They must hire practically any code monkey at ASUS. I ended up downgrading all my ASUS routers (main router and 3 mesh nodes) back down to the 3004 firmware just so that I can have an actual functioning network again.\n\nI also had an ASUS Chromebook. Honestly, I have nothing bad to say about the Chromebook. It was a solid machine. But it was a fucking Chromebook.\n\nI've owned so many different ASUS products, but the ones that I owned in the past 5 years have all been absolute crap. Never again.

Mine was returned to the vendor (Scan here in the UK) who forwarded the laptop to Asus who claimed that the 'fix' was actually a dodgy connection between the screen and the motherboard. The laptop was returned to me but never worked properly with constant complaints that 'a new CPU had been installed' and 'TPM module error' littering the Windows event viewer logs. \n\nI returned the laptop to the vendor who claimed no fault found and at that point I decided to write the thing off as a total loss. I bought a new system in the meantime but with the laptop investment nagging away I decided to have another attempt at getting a refund from the vendor, so raised another RMA and returned the laptop to the vendor once more. \n\nThey performed a factory reset of Windows (these laptops are factory locked to Windows 11 home which is another annoyance) and when they returned it a third time I could see that the Windows error log had experienced the same TPM chip problem I had been seeing (but after their reset and before they sent it back) so was able to use the fact that they'd seen said error but sent it back to me with no fault found (again!) as leverage and eventually received a decent (but not full because 2+ years had passed at this point) refund from the vendor.",

This often leads to fewer bugs, including security bugs.\n\nMeanwhile, the only distinct advantage closed source has is security through obscurity, which is not much help even in the best of times.",

In files and network traffic, nul-termination has the advantage that you don't need to know the length before you begin writing.\n\nReally depends what operations you'll be doing most: Copying/concatinating the string contents with little care for the specific text within, or parsing the contents without needing to touch string as a whole.\n\nBut storing the length separately probably makes for a better default.

          "text": "> 2. Eight Years of Vulnerability (handled questionably)\n\nThe PR that introduced the bug was from May 2017. This means that, roughly from version 3.6.0, any publicly-accessible MongoDB instance has been vulnerable to this.\n\nIt is unknown whether the exploit was known and exploited by actors prior to its disclosure. Given the simplicity of it, I bet it was.\n\nAs of the exploit’s disclosure, which happened on 19th of December, it has been a race to patch the database.\n\nSifting through Git history, it seems like the fix was initially committed on the 17th of December. It was merged a full 5 days after in the public repo - on the 22nd of December (1-line fix btw).\n\nThat beig said, MongoDB 8.0.17 containing the fix was released on Dec 19, consistent with the CVE publish data. While public JIRA activity shows that patches went out on the 22nd of December, I understand that Mongo develops in a private repository and only later syncs to the public one.\n\nIn any case - because there’s no official timeline posted, members of the community like me have to guess. As of writing, 10 days later in Dec 28, 2025, Mongo have still NOT properly addressed the issue publicly.\n\nThey only issued a community disclosure of the CVE a full five days after the publication of it. It is then, on the 24th of December, that they announced that all of their database instances in their cloud service Atlas were fully patched. Reading through online anecdotes, it seems like the service was patched days before the CVE was published. (e.g on the 18th)\n\nMongo says that they haven’t verified exploitation so far:\n\n“at this time, we have no evidence that this issue has been exploited or that any customer data has been compromised”",

You can use the Feedback Assistant to file it (this is the official way) and it's roughly equivalent to throwing a speck of dust into a supermassive black hole and hoping to get something out. Or you can post on Apple Developer Forum where someone promises to help you look into it with roughly the same result.

It got fixed but this shouldn't be a \"got to know the right people\" test just to fix a bug in their software.\n\nThe bug was affecting multiple large open source projects including the ones that Apple bundles as part of macOS.

Yeah, the former should be changed to \"int\" but I'm not going to change some database schema to avoid a cast.",

          "text": "> In Java we can take an alternative approach and use checked exceptions. But industry experience over the years seems to indicate that people don't enjoy using them. It's probably a matter of ergonomics. Using a wrapper type instead might be a more ergonomic alternative.\n\nIt is not a matter of ergonomics. The reason that checked exceptions are a pain to work with is because they create function colors (in the same way that async functions are colored). Using a wrapper type like Rust's `Result<T, E>` creates the exact same set of function colors with the same problems.\n\nIn particular, one of the big problems is that if an API expects a callback, it defines in the callback signature what colors it allows, and it is incompatible with callbacks of the wrong color, even if logically they would work perfectly fine (errors are typically bubbled up to the caller, so the API does not need to care what color the error is). Java's `Stream` API and it's incompatibility with checked exceptions is the most well known example of this.\n\nNow Rust is a little better than Java in that Rust has somewhat better support for generics over it's function colors. In Rust you can make your callback signature generic, and then the caller can choose what color to use. Still, unless the API is naturally generic this requires that the API author plans for this ahead of time. If they have their own error type that their API uses, they likely won't think about supporting other external error types. (Note that Java too allows you to define functions throwing generic checked exceptions, but for reasons it's even less likely to be provided to users).\n\nI've worked extensively in large codebases that use checked exceptions, unchecked exceptions, and Result types (specifically, it was a C++ codebase with exceptions disabled and an internal type very similar to Rust's Result type). The error handling story was essentially the same in all of these codebases: Errors could occur nearly anywhere and would be bubbled up to the top of the stack, where they would be generically handled with some logging and metrics, and then the operation that produced the error would be aborted (but the process would continue to handle other operations safely). This experience was the most pleasant in the codebase that used unchecked exceptions. Neither checked exceptions nor result types provided much useful information, and the processing code just distracted from the more important business logic. This was especially true for the code that used Results, as nearly half of the lines would contain some noise to handle the bubbling up of errors.\n\nAdditionally, I will say that the Result types generally provided the least useful information. There were no stack traces, the only debugging information you got was whatever the author chose to include in the error message (which was often grossly inadequate). I was eventually able to convince my team to make an effort to provide pseudo-stack traces by appending additional error message lines as we bubbled the errors up the stack though. This added even more noise to the error bubbling logic, but it greatly improved the debugging experience. So this is an issue that can be improved through diligence, ensuring that people consistently write good error messages, and including a stack trace with the error if you have a library that can do that, or manually building a pseudo-stack trace if you do not.",

This defeats one of the purported benefits of result wrappers: Use still know which functions can fail, but you no longer know *how* they can fail. Checked exceptions are the same, every module should typically define it's own exception type that wraps any internal exceptions. One of the benefits of unchecked exceptions is that you don't need all of this error wrapping, so when it actually comes time to handle the exception you don't need to do any unwrapping.",

You actually *need both* as they have very different proper use-cases. There are things where you reasonably *must expect failure* (for example when trying to open a file), and there are cases where you don't know what and if at all something could fail (for example in case of any kind of HOFs, where you can't know upfront whether some pure or effect-full function will be passed in; or when you call something in another layer, which is usually completely opaque to you, like it happens a lot with calling lib or framework code).\n\nFor the cases where you know all possible failure modes upfront you need some sum type to describe all possible results (so you can ensure all failure cases are always handled); that's where you use some result wrappers. But when you have no clue what can actually go wrong and / or can't handle failures reasonably in your layer (e.g. inside some lib code) you need exceptions, and likely unchecked exception in case you don't have some capability tracking system in place which could make checked exceptions bearable.\n\nRust is in this regard quite crippled as it still does not support proper exception for the cases where you need them. You can now catch panics but that's still a long way to go to have the full feature set of proper exceptions (and the first step would be anyway that the Rust people accept reality and start working on that).\n\nBTW, this is the first time I see someone relate to the \"monads don't compose\" problem as function coloring. In Rust that's not such a big problem at all as they have kind of \"standardized error monads\", so you usually don't have to map between different kinds of result wrappers.",

              "text": "This is a misunderstanding of the `Option` type.\n\nAn `Option` with a `None` value is not `null`! There is simply no `null`, and it's still an `Option`.\n\nIn Scala or Java, which have Options but also still nulls for legacy reasons, one can see the difference quite well. An object typed as `Option[T]` can be `Some[T]` or `None`, but *the reference to that object* can still be also `null`, and that's a completely different state! One can pattern match on the `Some` or `None` cases, and that's perfectly safe. But trying to do that in case the reference to that `Option` is `null` the pattern match will result in a runtime Null Pointer Exception. So in both language you have actually *three values* to consider for an `Option`: It can be `Some`, `None`, or the reference can be `null`. *The third case is almost certainly a bug*, but technically it's possible. To rule that third case out one would need to do what Rust did and just not add a `null` to the language at all.\n\nHaving `null` and `Option` at the same time has also further consequences: You can have a `Some` value containing `null`… So, `Some(null)` is not the same as `None`, and of course it's not the same as `null` (as it's a `Some`!).\n\nKotlin btw, with its stupid optional types can't express a `Some(null)`. This would simply collapse to `null` in Kotlin. *That's exactly* why `Option` is not just syntax sugar for \"some value or null\"! It's a \"real wrapper\" (which can be usually optimized away by a smart compiler so at runtime you have in fact only a value or a null, but that's not the language semantics, that's only a fully transparent optimization).",

It’s literally refuting the thesis \"there’s very limited benefit to static types\" that both of you guys seem to be so attached to.

That's not the debate. The debate is the leap from \"we had a production failure\" to \"there's very limited benefit to static types.\"\n\nYour anecdote proves the oldest lesson in software: tests and types don't make you correct, they just reduce the surface area of ways you can be wrong. Production failures still happen because production is where reality lives: messy inputs, weird data, unexpected load, partial outages, config drift, timing, and integration assumptions.\n\nStatic typing is useful precisely because it eliminates entire categories of failures that are annoying to test for and easy to miss, especially in large codebases and rarely-executed paths. Plenty of bugs don't show up in unit tests because your tests didn't model the exact shape of the data, or they never exercised the obscure branch, or the integration contract drifted. \"Null pointer in prod\" is a meme for a reason: not because everyone is lazy, but because complex systems eventually execute code paths you never observed. Modern type systems have caught up to null dereference and can make it fuck off before you can even run your code.\n\nSo sure: focus on runtime behavior, testing, observability, fast feedback loops. But pretending static types provide \"very limited benefit\" because a system once failed in production is like saying locks are pointless because someone broke a window.",

It is never *more* difficult to handle a game/system that doesn't use shaders. You have to convert shaders meaningfully and correctly when they do exist, and that is a non-trivial problem.",

(People will bicker about memory architecture and such, but, that's largely about performance; the applications largely aren't *that* sensitive to performance anymore, as console programmers have stopped doing the ridiculous tricks they used to do to get things to run on hardware, and have started defaulting to out-of-the-box engines and standardized, simplified code.)",

This text file has no particular legal or technical authority, and it’s not even particularly complicated. It represents a handshake deal between some of the earliest pioneers of the internet to respect each other’s wishes and build the internet in a way that benefitted everybody. It’s a mini constitution for the internet, written in code.\n\nIt’s called robots.txt and is usually located at yourwebsite.com/robots.txt. That file allows anyone who runs a website — big or small, cooking blog or multinational corporation — to tell the web who’s allowed in and who isn’t. Which search engines can index your site? What archival projects can grab a version of your page and save it? Can competitors keep tabs on your pages for their own files? You get to decide and declare that to the web.\n\nIt’s not a perfect system, but it works. Used to, anyway. For decades, the main focus of robots.txt was on search engines; you’d let them scrape your site and in exchange they’d promise to send people back to you. Now AI has changed the equation: companies around the web are using your site and its data to build massive sets of training data, in order to build models and products that may not acknowledge your existence at all.\n\nWe made this article free to read for the rest of the day: https://www.theverge.com/24067997/robots-txt-ai-text-file-web-crawlers-spiders",

And frankly hardware has gotten better to the point that you don't even need those solutions to solve it anymore.  For instance thread per connection works just fine for 10k clients.\n\nThe real work right now is on the C10M problem, which is quite a bit harder.  That's where you see not just a return to the need for event driven thread per core architectures, but also colocating the data plane of your business logic with the network stack and driver in the same address space.  You either do this through DPDK style sticking everything in user space, or Netflix CDN sendfile+ktls sticking everything in kernel space.",

I wonder how many of the irrational desires you mentioned would be filtered out if the cost constraint were well understood?\n\nSimilarly, how many “solutions” from the team aren’t ways to reduce costs or solve the business problem, but instead misguided ways to try to solve organizational complexity?  I think some teams that choose something like microservices fall into this trap, taking on technical inefficiencies and complexity to try to avoid the overhead of team communication.\n\nThis has become a bit of a rant, but I’ll wrap up by saying that I think a lot of people think they’re solving some unique challenge when the fact is that very few of us are actually doing anything new.  Or, worse, they don’t want to use a tried and true solution because it’s not fun, so they instead do mental gymnastics to justify “reinventing the wheel” and get away with it because very for businesses have a good way of measuring the productivity of IT/Dev teams.",

Safari on the iPhone was really the first mobile browser that handled full desktop websites adequately.\n\nThe \\~960 pixel width was chosen because most websites around 2007 that *didn't* have explicit sizes set implicitly targeted a common browser window width thus a viewport width of 1000 pixels. For a text-only page it can be too big of a window size. Even a single `meta` `viewport` tag in the `head` would fix the text flow issues because viewport would be explicit and the text re-flowed accordingly.

The interesting part for me is that it took so long to exploit well at the software level. Sure, every compression algorithm has been vectorized for awhile, but at this point, it’s foundational to things like modern hash tables. A 40+ year old abstraction used absolutely everywhere (see Swiss tables for more). I think it took so long in part because the algorithms are wildly different for things that aren’t *embarrassingly parallel* in nature.",

Something like an R-Tree like index (depending on how often they move) which has all the bikes cached in RAM in the app; not off in redis or something.\n\nThe same with rust just with actix or something.\n\nNon encrypted, I am willing to bet that your single request time would be below 1ms, given a lat long bounding box and maybe 50k bikes in memory, along with a probable 50 bikes in that area. \n\nSomething like this could easily handle 5-10k requests per second; which implies way more than 10k logged in customers. With some extra well thought out optimization, maybe 50k requests per second.\n\nFor more mundane things like just asking for the details of one bike; now you are looking at 100's K per second. \n\nWhere c++ or rust would also shine would be updating said R-Tree. \n\nThen, it would just monitor some other \"source of truth\" data stream for updates.\n\nYes, there are backends which can somewhat do this. But, where things start to go wrong is that as you push the data processing into higher and higher levels of mathematics, the feature either sucks, or simply becomes unusable. \n\nOn the surface, there are even geo plugins with some DBs. But, where this doesn't work well, is that you often need to customize this to the n'th degree. For example, if someone zooms out one level, you might get the next level of zoom ready to go. You might do a kalman on someone rapidly moving the map in one direction, to anticipate their next requests. You want to do this fast enough to make it smooth as silk on their end. No progress bars, no delays, it just works.\n\nAn alternative to what I described, is to have lots and lots of power available. This costs money. What I am describing would probably run well on a crap tiny single server for a huge number of simultaneous users. This could be the difference between $10 per month, and $20k per month. But, with a system as complex as what would get you to 20k per month, you are now looking at way more mental load on the developers; and probably slower development. I find the \"benefits\" of many microservices fails fairly quickly as people don't stick to the super separation intent. Things start becoming overly cross dependant. \n\nSome fools will say, \"Just don't do that\" but it would be telling me to walk across a tight-rope between two skyscrapers and saying, \"Super simple, just don't fall off.\" \n\n\n\nFor CRUD type things, that can be solved using probably 10+ commonly used tech stacks just fine up to fairly high capacities.",

The idea that you should just \"shut up and calculate\" is an unhealthy approach that will limit you as without an understanding you will struggle as you get into more advanced concepts.

I assume reddit's allergic reaction to this observation stems from r/Programming being mostly made up of college students who are just generally anxious about the day they have to look for a job.\n\nBut at the major tech companies, everybody wants juniors who express interest in AI. They don't have to actually be good at it. They just have to not be a little bitch about it.\n\nInterestingly, some of the candidates we've interviewed were convinced by their teachers to never use AI (which makes sense, because it undermines the value of the teacher.) So even though they were top students at top schools, we couldn't hire them out of risk that they might not continue learning on the job. We instead hired some kids from less prestigious schools who were full of that adventurous spirit. The first couple months have worked out amazingly...",

It depends a lot on the application how useful AI is imo BUT I always think AI is far more useful for senior developers.\n\nAs an example, a junior guy at work just figured out how to use co-pilot and it's a very mixed bag. On one hand, the code that he produced was FAR better but on the other hand, the logic of his code was horrible and due to producing more code than normal, it took me far longer to go through is PR and spot all the mistakes he had made.\n\nMe on the other hand, on projects where AI works well, I have probably worked twice as fast, with a bit better code but a lot better documented and united + integration tested. My 2 fellow senior developers that are working on the same application are also writing code using AI and for most of it, you'd not be able to spot whom of us did what.\n\nI definitely think the value is far greater for senior developers but the good part for junior developers is that their code will no longer stick out like a sore thumb and the more you set up your codebase to be easy on AI and reviewers, the better it will be for both juniors and seniors.",

Not overly complicated, but it was supposed to be a solution to a bug. Was it a solution? No, not at all. It was this insane, overly defensive custom event listener crafted to hook a secure function, if ever called, to check the output of the other function called, and if the output was wrong in several conditions, to rewrite the output. And still, it didn't really account for edge cases or why the fix needed to be implemented to begin with, and it also would fail if load order was not considered in some circumstances. \n\nIt didn't resolve the source of the bug which is what was wanted. Boolean gating it away downstream so no errors get thrown is not a fix!\n\nThe LLM solution was actually fairly sound, logically, but no actual human would write it because it was so much work where the coder would quickly realize how stupid of an implementation this was.\n\nThe actual solution was literally a single line fix and the LLM failed because they didn't prompt with full context.\n\nI am just thinking of all these companies that are just committing all this trash bloated AI slop and how much if a mess it is going to make for them that they can't just LLM their way out of. I say this as someone who loves using AI to speed up my work and clarify things, debug, and so on. But man, I know how flawed it is. You have to know what to throw out and when it's not reliable.",

A junior + an LLM can reduce the signal:noise ratio of your PR queue until it's absolutely useless.\n\nA *senior* can also do that, but as a senior they are going to go back and forth **much more** with the LLM than read the code, hits the \"LGTM, create PR\" button and move on.\n\nI've looked at projects that people (here and on HN, I think) claimed was done by the LLM to a high quality, and without fail it was either:\n\n1.

That 100K doesn't count the code in the framework, BTW.\n\nWhen I look at what people are claiming as their productivity output, when they also claim \"having 20 years of experience\", I shake my head - no way would I pass that code in a review.\n\nThe only way I get really good code from an LLM is by a proper back and forth (pushing back on quite a lot of what it gives, and questioning the rationale for quite a lot of what it gives).\n\nHalf the time, you give the code back to the LLM and ask a pointed question like \"That looks horribly over-engineered\", they **will** respond with \"You're absolutely right\" and then proceed to change it.\n\nIf *even the LLM* can review the code and say \"Whoops, I made a boo-boo\", why aren't the \"seniors\" doing it? You can't review more than a few thousands of lines of code per day, so having the LLM spit out 20k lines/day means effectively no reviewing will be done.",

Instead of spending hours writing thousands of lines of code or searching Stack Overflow for syntax, engineers can use AI tools to handle the boring stuff.\n\n**The fallacy is that basic work being done today somehow \"doesn't count\".  When it absolutely, 100% counts.**\n\nI'll use another industry as the example.  Landscaping.  Lets say you found a perfect AI driven lawnmower.  All you have to do is drop it off at a home/office building, let it do it's thing, then pick it up an hour later, and it drives itself right back onto your truck.\n\nYou tell your staff \"hey guys, you don't have to worry about the 'grunt work' of mowing lawns anymore! You can do the more detailed work of planting flowers, trimming hedges, and things like that! Won't that be great!\"\n\nBut... 60% of your workers time is currently spent mowing lawns.  Sure - is the other work more interesting, and more skilled?  Of course, but... so what?  You just took away 60% of their work!!!  That's what they got paid to do! You don't need 50 landscapers on staff anymore.  Your 30 lawn mowers are replaced by 5 guys who just deliver AI lawnmowers to locations.\n\nThat's what's happening here.  Saying \"you don't have to do the boring stuff\" anymore is STUPID because we currently *get paid* to do the \"boring stuff.\"  When you take that away, you take work away.  You *take jobs away.* \n\nSo sure, it will only be the \"interesting\" stuff left, but... it will be the \"interesting\" stuff left for the 30% of remaining employees.  That 70% that get fired aren't going to feel comforted that their buddy Jim who still has a job has a more interesting job than he used to.",

Eg we had a fairly large json payload that was an in flight only interface (was not stored) but was the main interface we’d fail to process. We sampled that down from millions a minute to 1% to fit in our monitoring (was working at NR at the time) and could almost always find a good example to help us root cause issues on the spot.\n\nYou can imagine this is as simple as adding a call to random + single http call.\n\nWould never have made sense to store all those payloads.\n\nGenerally sampling helps at scale, especially with more amorphous things like this.",

That will severely limit your logging options and will cause you to structure your code around your logging needs. \n\nWith distributed tracing, you start a span (log context) and as long as you are within the given context, you can add semantic context (attributes) to the active span. \n\nI’ve the span context exits, it will be logged along with all of the attached structured data. \n\nThis allows for much richer and detailed context information to be attached to the trace span than would be possible with mere logging.",

It would also be less performant to accumulate the log lines of a request to be dumped at once. Might as well not be dumped at all if there is an intermediate failure before the logging call. That is what logging line by line is about: you can find the trace of events. Accumulating would make code more complex as well. It would require an error-safe single exit point.\n\nIt seems all the problems of the author are how to find a user's request in a sea of lines. Maybe tag the request lines with user ID and request ID? See, structured logging (or even just good formatting in plain text) is enough. What you need is to understand the code and where each line gets logged. Maybe people not familiar with the code should not be reading log traces?\n\nNow we can discuss the problems of logging in distributed applications. That is where the real problems arise. But it is the consequence of a pernicious trend of moving every single system to microservices. The complexity moves to deployment and operations, and logging is one of the things that get harder. Still no excuse not to pass a request ID to the next microservice you call.",

Any `struct`ure/`class` that is instantiated has its constructor called (that's part of the object lifetimes of C++ - you actually do need to do this, or at least set up the lifetime doing something like `std::launder` - though it's become much more lax since IIRC C++20 for things like arrays). A POD/trivial `struct` doesn't *have* a constructor, so a default constructor is generated that does absolutely nothing and is completely elided.\n\nThe only difference is that one has a constructor that does something and one doesn't. However, the default constructor on one that *does* do something *still* won't initialize member variables that don't default-initialize.\n\n> Any Type (Braces) \t`T obj{}`; \tValue Initialized (Safe / Zeroed)\n\nThis suggests that this is a kind of variable declaration. It is not. It is you initializing `obj` with a default value. This is [\"value-initialization\"](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/value_initialization.html).\n\n> `unsigned char d = c; // no undefined/erroneous behavior,`\n\nThis is being misused. This is intended to go along with the idea that those types can be used to alias/introspect other types - like `(unsigned char*)&foo`. As you say here:\n\n>> Some quick research seems to indicate that these types are special cases to allow code to manipulate raw bytes like memcpy or buffer management without the compiler freaking out. Which...maybe makes sense?\n\nThe fact that no trap representation exists for those types has been brought up before - indeterminate value behavior is underspecified in the standard.\n\n> Either the compiler forces you to set each field in the struct when creating it, or it does not force you, and in this case, it zero-initializes all unmentioned fields.\n\nI mean, the entire point of your post was that the compiler *doesn't* zero-initialize them by default.. because it doesn't. Unless they have `static` storage duration. This behavior is common for both C++ *and* C.\n\n\"Obviously correct\" is questionable:\n\n1. I do not always want things initialized ahead-of-time. This is more common in low-latency stuff.\n2. \"Zero\" isn't necessarily a better default value than none. It's more-defined, but it is just as possible to still be wrong, and can still cause hidden errors that are hard to find. It's just likely \"better\" than no default value.\n\n> Syntax that looks like C but sometimes does something completely different than C, invisibly. This syntax can be perfectly correct (e.g. in the case of an array, or a non POD type in some cases) or be undefined behavior. This makes code review really difficult. C and C++ really are two different languages.\n\nThis behavior is completely identical between C and C++, and is in fact behavior inherited from C.\n\n> The compiler does not warn about undefined behavior and we have to rely on third-party tools, and these have limitations, and are usually slow\n\nBecause it's not required to, and not all undefined behavior is actually runtime behavior. A lot of the UB detection it does is actually to determine valid bounds of things - determining that a possible value is UB, and thus knowing that that part of a loop is impossible or such. It cannot always distinguish between actual UB and inferred UB.\n\nSaid UB detection is also not always possible within the front-end, and thus it would be *very* difficult to properly push a warning that is meaningful.\n\n> The compiler happily generates a default constructor that leaves the object in a half-initialized state\n\nWhich is a good thing in many cases. There are a lot of situations where I do *not* want things to be initialized ahead of time.\n\n> So many ways in C++ to initialize a variable, and most are wrong.\n\n\"Wrong\" is subjective.\n\n> For the code to behave correctly, the developer must not only consider the call site, but also the full struct definition, and whether it is a POD type.\n\nThis can just be read as \"the developer must be aware of the APIs they are using\".\n\n> Adding or removing one struct field (e.g. the data field) makes the compiler generate completely different code at the call sites.\n\nI mean... why wouldn't it?\n\n> In the end I am thankful for this bug, because it made me aware for the first time that undefined behavior is real and dangerous, for one simple reason: it makes your program behave completely differently than the code. By reading the code, you cannot predict the behavior of the program in any way. The code stopped being the source of truth. Impossible values appear in the program, as if a cosmic ray hit your machine and flipped some bits. And you can very easily, and invisibly, trigger undefined behavior.\n\nYou mean... undefined behavior causes your program to behave in an... *undefined* manner?\n\n> I just want to raise awareness on this (perhaps) little-known rule in the language that might trip you up.\n\nI sincerely hope that this is not little-known.",

Unfortunately python has a much larger ecosystem.\n\nI find ruby to be less readable than python to be honest. Ruby for starters has implicit returns, which are just confusing to read unless you're really used to them. Then there's the optional parenthesis, then there is the weird use of `|` to define anonymous functions. Then there's the fact that boolean coercion is stricter for no good reason (in python, an empty string or array is falsy, allowing the language to flow more easily).\n\nOverall if ruby truly was more readable than python, there is no doubt that it would have \"won\".

There is a tradeoff though because it uses more CPU, and you have to do a bunch of performance testing to see if it's really better when turning it on. It also had a bunch of CVEs which delayed adoption. So a lot of large projects haven't adopted it because of the security aspect. It avoids system calls and lets you read/write directly to a buffer in kernel memory. Also, processes that use it need specific permissions from the OS, so it's not as plug and play as just running a regular Java process. Oh yeah and a lot of popular Linux OS don't have a new enough kernel to take advantage of the full io_uring API. Overall, it's still new enough that it's going to take a while before we start seeing it used more. My guess would be 3-5 years.",

I don't own an iPhone; I can't really evaluate that side of it.\n\n> meta viewport incantations\n\nViewport tags are one of the things that *are* underspecified. Their effect is to control how `100vw` or `100vh` map to CSS `px` values. If you select `device-width`, then on Android, the width of the layout viewport in CSS pixels (i.e. the simulated pixel resolution) is your device's screen width in Android \"density-independent\" pixels. Basically, convert from your actual DPI to Android's simulated 160 DPI, and then shear off the unit and use that number as the size within CSS's simulated 96 DPI. A phone with a 1080px width can present itself as just 411px wide, for example.\n\nThe kicker is that every `@media` query you could use to test pixel density or screen size is similarly broken, but they're broken *on purpose* as part of the spec. (Among other things, this means that breakpoints, the most popular approach to \"responsive design,\" are based on a pile of distorted abstractions.) In general, CSS's handling of pixel density is an irredeemable, abject disaster.\n\n> To try to fill the screen on all platforms I admittedly made a fragile choice: I used transform:scale to ensure that the main screen element was centered and sized.\n\nThis... seems like a situation where meta viewport tags could've actually helped. I opened the game briefly, and it seems like you wanted a constant aspect ratio with letterboxing or windowboxing. Off the top of my head (I'm on my phone now so I can't test this), if you set the meta viewport width to a constant size, and set `aspect-ratio` and some layout properties on your root to center it, then you'd be able to use consistent units and let the browser scale it for you, no?\n\n> Safari was also late to support this and needed a -webkit-backdrop-filter:blur() variation to get the visual effect to appear on older tablets.\n\nYou think *that's* bad? There was a long while where Firefox didn't support this at all, but would *claim* to if you tried to check it with `@supports` rules.\n\n> Edge seems not to have diverged much at all from the Chrome ancestry from which was is forked.\n\nWell, *yeah*. Why would they take their hard work trying to modernize IE in the form of pre-Chromium Edge, throw it all in the trash, and fork Chromium, just to *then* do all the work of maintaining the core engine themselves? For all intents and purposes, Edge is just a Chrome reskin.\n\n> Caniuse mentions an iOS Safari glitch, but doesn't say \"this will basically never work on mobile\" even though it should. [...] The web standards don't say this because web standards aren't trying to create a consistent experience for all users.\n\nOh, come the fuck on, lmao. \"The failure to explain that `:hover` has no effect on devices which intrinsically cannot hover is a hole in the reference documentation and a failure of web standards as a concept.\" Really?\n\nYes, browsers could offer your \"hover-simulating crosshair\" idea. Given that that's completely alien to basically all mobile UX, these browsers' decision not to do that represents an interaction that is unavailable at the platform level, not the browser level.\n\n> MDN lists the shiftKey property of MouseEvent as \"widely supported\", even though soft keyboards on mobile will NOT deliver this event with shiftKey set to true, ever.\n\nAgain: the fact that an interaction is not possible on all platforms, for UX reasons outside the bounds of the browser, does not constitute a hole in browser support.\n\n> I hope at this point you're yelling at your screen, \"these are accessibility design problems! You can't expect MDN to protect you from not designing properly!!!\" And to that I say --- I hear you, but, are we sure about that? Consider: One major reason why accessibility is so bad across modern computer interfaces is that developers must do something extra to offer accessibility. But these secondary quality characteristics will always be, well, secondary. One way we could have ensured that designs are accessible is to make it impossible to build anything else. Instead, we've filled the standard web API with conditional features that don't work for most people, and then we describe them as \"widely supported\". We are making this problem worse when we could be making it better.\n\nAnd this is the point that those prior examples bend language to justify. \"The standards are deficient because I have to actually understand and consider the capabilities of the platforms I feel entitled to be able to build for.\" The modern frontend developer mindset in a nutshell. It's the same mindset that made things like Electron popular for \"\"\"native\"\"\" app development: webdevs could actually learn and try to master the platforms they want to build for, or they could refuse to learn anything new and just have users install a sixth copy of Google Chrome. The complaint quoted above is just that mindset turned back around on frontend development itself.\n\n> Design for mobile first [...]  \n> You probably need at least two layouts\n\n\"Mobile first\" too often turns into \"mobile only,\" which [has its own UX issues](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/content-dispersion/).\n\nYou need two layouts, but if you fail to build both, \"desktop first\" produces experiences that are comfortable on desktop and borderline unusable on mobile, while \"mobile first\" produces experiences that are comfortable on mobile and uncomfortable on desktop. The latter outcome is better than the former outcome, but it's also easier to settle for, if that makes sense.",

I think lock-free maps have very different constraints, and doing them justice would take a separate deep dive which I’m not fully ready to write up yet.~~\n\nWow.\n\nI had mostly thought of NBHM as \"just\" a lock-free data structure, but digging into the actual implementation now, and the amount of care put into hot-path micro-optimizations is genuinely impressive.\n\nThe hash memoization idea also feels remarkably close to SwissTable. I ran into a very similar issue when optimizing my own SwissTable implementation: `Objects.equals` on the hot path caused profile pollution and introduced a virtual-call boundary that the JIT couldn’t easily optimize away. Seeing the same concern addressed here — avoiding expensive `equals()` calls via a cheap hash-based filter —was a real \"aha\" moment for me.\n\nAlso, the cooperative resizing idea is strikingly similar to `ConcurrentHashMap`.\n\nThis was super helpful. I learned a lot from it, and I'll definitely add it to the write-up.\n\nThanks for sharing!",

Your data holds data not data AND behavior. \n\n3. Straightforward -> Toilsome\n\nHow much bullshit typing to do I have to do to do the thing?

There's almost no value in mocking API calls, in a real life you'll find that the actual API behaves just a little different, or changes over time, making your test look good for coverage purposes, and not much more. YMMV of course, but I usually create an interface, have the real integration and a fake integration. At least I don't have to deal with the obscure error messages mocking frameworks give, I am less tempted to mock every service call which will make it impossible to refactor anything later, and it usually allows me to write acceptance tests up front, should there be value in that.",

It takes more time. Considerably more.\n\nYou also have to think more about things, because you just cannot treat AI PRs the same. Reviews aren't deterministic. Programming isn't. For example, oftentimes you come across a problem where there's multiple equally good solutions. Now if I'm reviewing such a case, and a trusted, experienced colleague tells me \"In my experience, A is actually better in our context because y, and I know in 3 months we'll have to do x, where that fits right in\", this is something I can *trust* my colleague with. \n\nNow, AI isn't even capable of doing this on its own, because it's missing the context, but even if you give it that, I cannot *trust* its results. I have to verify each and every claim it makes. \n\nI trust my colleagues not to lie an make up stuff on the spot. I do not fact check every thing they say. And that's a good thing because it would be incredibly impractical.\n\nNow imagine you had a colleague who repeatedly lied to you. Misrepresented and made up facts. You couldn't trust that person. Probably, that person would be fired quite swiftly. But if they were not, you would be way more thorough in your reviews, basically resulting in all the work being done twice.\n\nThis is how AI generated PRs work in practice.",

This can't be solved just by breaking down PRs into smaller ones (although I'd argue it's more a matter of structuring commits), which many people aren't doing well anyway and you also see AI creeping into things like commit descriptions because they can't be bothered. Projects like the Linux kernel solve it through discipline, abstraction and things like semantic patching to express large-scale refactoring in a reviewable way.

That a problem my team struggles with today, was the same thing he struggled with 60 years ago.\n\nThere are many people who discuss living documentation.\n\nThat’s one example. I feel there are many throughout the book.",

That's just not really the case anymore, someone going through documentation for me would be nice but not a fulltime job for them because it's not that much work (and you definitely wouldn't need several people), and the closest analogue to oldschool paperwork would be writing up PRs and resolving tickets which I'd rather just do myself anyway.\n\nI'm not the person you asked, I think a lot of the book holds true today without issue, and you can even draw some good applicable wisdom about this chapter too.

Every tool you use microservice/api/architecture is going to do its job well or you will just drop it for another one. And those tools have well written documentation and frequently engineering teams behind them you can contact should there be issues.

But if the left side is the literal token \"eval\" like the first example, this triggers special historical behavior which isn't like a normal function call, and the eval'ed code runs in the local context as through it had been typed in right there, including access to local variables that a function call wouldn't have access to.

At my current workplace, we just rely on the deserializer rejecting incompatible data, which isn't *ideal*, but it works quite well in practice for us (breaking changes to the data we cache are exceedingly rare, and when they do occur, the deserializer catches them and we just treat the value as if it was uncached).  No reason to get more complicated than that if you don't need to.\n\nI do really like the idea of versioning based on a hash of the type, though.  I might push us to explore that in the future.

          "text": "> Serializable Snapshot Isolation (SSI): Used by PostgreSQL and others. Tracks read/write patterns across transactions and detects conflicts. If a conflict is detected that could violate serializability, one transaction is aborted.\n\nI went into a rabbithole a couple of months ago because I was curious how the math behind this works. In Postgres, [this seems to be the code](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/5987553fde2cb22b69cf9c7d71a92573b7a3b7c9/src/backend/storage/lmgr/predicate.c#L4536) checking for serialization failures. There is [a paper](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/cse584/static_files/papers/snapshot-psql.pdf) written by its implementers describing their experiences for those curious.\n\nThe correctness of the algorithm seems to be largely based on [Alan Fekete's work](https://dsf.berkeley.edu/cs286/papers/ssi-tods2005.pdf), particularly Theorem 2.1. Recall from one's database class that you can build a directed graph representing the dependencies among database transactions, and that the history used to construct the graph is serializable iff the graph is acyclic. It turns out that very similar results apply to MVCC databases, and Alan shows that you can skip this expensive cycle check as long as there isn't any \"dangerous structure\" present in the graph.\n\nNote that I didn't spend that long reading the literature behind this, maybe only 2 months with my time after work. If someone more familiar with the mathematics and implementation here notices a mistake, please do correct me!",

I agree completely with the idea that there's no such thing as \"free money on the ground\" but also I wouldn't play down the inefficiencies.\n\nI used to work on a middleware project where we provided interrupt completion callbacks. There are basically what unstructured exceptions are. Also pretty close to what unix signals are. We did this because our customers (programmers using our middleware) needed to be able to catch this stuff when it happens.\n\nAt least half the customers would try to slather on a couple layers to try to turn asynchronous callbacks back into synchronous ones. Most would fail because they didn't understand systems programming but would succeed in wiring up the interrupt callback to code that their higher level programmers didn't know would run at interrupt time.\n\nSo there would be code which the higher level programmers wrote without the idea of interrupt time restrictions being called at interrupt (or deferred completion) time. And eventually it would crash and they would see our code in the stack backtraces and tell us our code was crashing their system.\n\nIt was maddening. I could totally see why developers didn't like the restrictions of asynchronous callbacks, but they also didn't understand that if it were as simple as removing those restrictions we would have done it in our middleware.\n\nI saw a crash report from some app on my Mac which was going to be sent to Apple (you can review them before sending them) included a stack trace and part of the backtrace was something like (all caps) a function named \"IOKIT_IS_CALLING_A_COMPLETION_CALLBACK\". A useful diagnostic, even if it doesn't fix the issues just call them out.",

You don't want your partitions to be too big, because you can exceed the capacity of the executor nodes.

Having row groups and being compressed internally means that reads could be split to run in parallel, and reduce the amount of network traffic required to read. Hive partitioning meant you could do 'partition pruning' by completely avoiding reading partitions that could not have data you needed. Deltalake/Iceberg stats metadata meant you could do range checks for values to skip individual files. ZOrdering could improve file skipping behaviour by organising more useful spreads of value ranges. Liquid clustering and hidden partitions made it easier to rework logical partitioning of files without actually having nested folder structures. Bucketby mechanisms meant that joins could be avoided if both sources were bucketed by the same value.",

If you reach something like 100,000 tests, even if each one is only 1ms, that's still 16 minutes to run the full suite.\n\n2) Some tests are just slow. Setting up mocks can be expensive. Some test frameworks are slow to spin up. I have worked with JavaScript framework testing libraries that emulate the UI state for test and it is very slow to click buttons and enter text into fields, on the order of several milliseconds. So every test is usually at least 5ms. \n\nIntegration tests are worse. You can't take any shortcuts, the application has to fully respond. It's not uncommon to see a 30 second integration test. Several hundred of those is already a problem. \n\nIn any of these scenarios, it is worth considering which tests provide real value.",

Different seniors may have different, valid, opinion on what is a valuable tests. Juniors may don't know better.\n\nAt that point it should be possible to split the test suite, run it in parallel, and start thinking more in terms of policies to apply than if a single tests is reasonable or not.\n\nPolicies are like: \"a test suite has 1 minute budget.\" (Of course what is a suite depends on your own environment and what makes sense.)\n\nFor mocks, there is no good reason why they are slow. In general if you communicate with an external process (database) you should not mock it. Just assert that the message you send makes sense. Do not actually send an SQL query, wait for an execution, and keep the test moving. \n\nFor tests that need databases mock the database interaction with dependency injection. Wrap your SQL query in a function and class and pass that to the class.\n\nUsing tools like monkey patching is terrible for both performances but also for design. If your code has a dependency, make it obvious in the constructor and pass it in both production code and as a fake/mock in testing.\n\nThis improves the overall designs and make it simpler to follow the code.

Resetting the system to a known state and/or running all tests should be tasks that can be run separately to the above, not literally the only things your testing enviroment can do. If your tooling doesn't allow this trivially, I'd consider it a deal breaker.\n- Any flaky or slow test needs to be off the main suite and must have a very good reason to exist in general.

I don't really know where to fit this into it -- I suspect the terminology thst you and the AI model are using might be slightly skew to how PL theorists would describe it, but I'm not sure.\n\n\nA question about the semantics -- does the presence of \"v\" in the handler imply that, when you override one of these \"effects\", the overridden effect (and its parent and so forth, back to the root) all run first, always? I wonder if it would make more sense to run them only on demand, and if so to use a more function-call-like syntax, like `super()` or similar, instead of `v`. This would also allow for (optionally?) changing the argument list, when calling a \"parent\" effect.\n\n\nNeat stuff. (No idea if it'd got practical applications, these kinds of highly-dynamic features tend to make for disastrously hard-to-read code, but used judiciously they can be powerful.)\n\n\nEDIT: I see that you indeed don't call \"upstream\" unless v is used. I would very seriously consider a more function-call-like syntax there.",

Since I have `continue k`, I thought writing `continue k v` had a nice rhyme/symmetry to it.\n\nThat said, I completely agree that a function-call syntax like `super()` is the more standard and correct way to handle this, especially for the reasons you mentioned.",

My usual work setup is WSL with kiro-cli/codex-cli. I only work with F# as a hobby, and in that case I occasionally use Visual Studio with dotnet on my personal PC.\n\nFor this project, I used Visual Studio with a WSL terminal. Since I mainly issue AI prompts in Korean, I ran into an issue where Korean input was broken in the VS integrated terminal (whether this is a VS 2026 issue or a VS+WSL issue is unclear).\n\nI wanted to avoid switching to an external terminal or spending time on additional configuration, so I used a somewhat tricky workaround. Because AGENTS.md is typically read first by the CLI, I wrote my requirements directly into AGENTS.md instead of typing them into the command line, and then simply ran commands like \"follow agents.md\" in the codex CLI.\n\nAs a result, the commit history of AGENTS.md effectively corresponds to CLI prompt history rather than meaningful project changes. For that reason, I intentionally excluded it from commits, as it did not make sense to commit it every time.",
