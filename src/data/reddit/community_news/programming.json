I've also had to pull out 30% of the dev capacity because it wasn't making margin while we bring in basic release management, automated test, working CI/CD and other patterns.\n\nThere's a massive co-hort of of engineers <35 who've never put together a big 6 month release, and it shows. I've had to bring back old-ass practices into play like formal gold candidate releases etc - the type of shit you did when you were shipping CD-ROMs - just to tighten up a monthly major release that was creating havoc with client escalations month after month. We're quietly rebuilding the entire deployment pipeline, encapsulating code and services and putting proper interfaces in, and getting ready to shift off some old technology decisions, but it's a slow process.\n\nThere's far too many people in the industry who can only code to an explicit instruction from a senior, and don't have the skills to identify re-use opportunities etc. AI will just produce more of that explosion of non-talent in my view.",

Because I don’t need high level thinking, what I need is someone to pair with who knows bog standard typescript better than I do, which is a low bar. And the bonus is what it does something flagrantly wrong or non-idiomatic I _generally_ can smell it from a mile away and can at least glean what not to do even from bad sessions. \n\nAll that being said I also get extremely frustrated with the capriciousness and lack of cohesion of the js ecosystem. There are a few shining beacons of logic and reasonable convention but most of the time I am just baffled that it caught on because so much of it is opinionated while also being sectarian so it feels like you have to struggle through a half dozen reinvented wheels, you need to reinvent a half dozen wheels, then maybe you find a workflow that doesn’t result in a bunch of make work wheel spinning. It’s no wonder most models veer in your doing over complex wordy galaxy brained shit, the corpus varies so wildly across all dimensions of quality and cohesiveness.",

My answer was essentially three main points:\n\n1. A good senior develoepr that cleanly understands how to do all aspects of coding is enhanced by AI because AI can code faster than you for a lot of things. For example, it will blow me out of the water writing unit tests.\n\n2. A junior developer will immediately level up to an intermediate because the AI is already better than them. It knows how to code, it understands a lot of the simpler aspects of coding quite well, and it can simply churn out decent code pretty fast if you're good enough with it.\n\n3. A junior developer will be hard capped in their skill progression by AI. They will become too reliant on it and struggle to understand things on their own. They won't be able to give you answers without the AI nor will they understand when the AI is wrong. And worse, they won't be inquisitive enough to question the AI. They'll run into bugs they have to debug and have no idea what to do, where to start, etc.\n\nI stand by it as my experience in the workplace has shown. It may not be the case for everyone but this is how I've seen it.",

Maybe they use AI to do 99% of their work or 1% of their work. As a manager, I only use it for super boring crap like converting a code base in one language to a code base in another language.\n\nBut the design department's use of AI is more interesting. Our design department has 70 designers, and only 10 of those 70 are kind of technical. The other 60 designers sit around designing all these design experiences in Figma, way way faster than the engineers can implement the designs.\n\nAnd it's not even clear whether we *should* implement all the designer's designs. Their designs look prettier and probably are a better user experience, but that doesn't necessarily make us more money. We have lots of designers because our software makes billions and it's fine, but they mostly sit around unhappy that their designs don't make it into product.\n\nSo in late 2025 they all started just asking the AI to implement their designs. And that works, at least in a prototyping sense. So now they're all using their own designs in prototype form. And I know a couple of them have changed their own designs, based on the results of the prototype.\n\nThis is super productive, because now instead of having to harass my engineers to implement bad designs, they only have to harass my engineers to implement well tested, fully prototyped designs, that have already had many rounds of design iteration.\n\nOf course I know my engineers just copy and paste the AI prototype code into the real codebase.

LLMs turned basically into a \"high level programming language\", just one with unpredictable compiler. It's what developers have been doing for many years already - make highly expressive programming languages, where you write little code and get a lot of functionality. Oneliner in Python could be hundreds lines of C or thousands lines of assembly. This is just another step - oneliner prompt could be hundreds of lines of python. With the caveat that this \"compiler\" is not deterministic and often generates incorrect code... When you compile your C code to a binary, you don't disassemble it to inspect the assembly and verify it's correct, you trust that the compiler works fine. With LLMs no such guarantees exist.\n\n> This is partly because composing prompts and giving context to the LLM takes a lot of time, sometimes comparable as writing the code manually.\n\nAs for the detail level of prompts - that's also nothing new. Anyone who has been programming for more than 10-15 years has seen this. We've been here before. What vibe coders re-discovered as \"LLM spec driven development\" is nothing more than what used to be called \"Model Driven Development\" - that was the idea that non-developers could simply draw UML diagrams and generate software from that. And there are still tools that actually let you do that! The twist? To get what you really wanted the diagrams would have to be as detailed as the code would be, which essentially turned this into a \"graphical programming language\" and those non-developers became developers of this weird language.\nThat's exactly what we see now with LLMs - people simply became \"programmers\" of this weird prompt programming language. Unfortunately as far as programming languages go, it's a very bad one...",

Ultimately it is speed up but you spend far more time reading code than writing it when doing it this way.\n\nBut letting it handle C++ template errors is worth it alone.

The fact that they found no statistically significant productivity gains *is* the far more interesting finding, but it's not what they were looking for, and it's not the best study design for looking at that. It is of course still surprising that they found no evidence that AI users are faster when the AI knows the library and the people do not.\n\nThe fair comparison would be on a population that's familiar with the library, half with AI, half without. And where they're allowed to use agents rather than just chat, since one would expect that to be faster. And perhaps accounting for what they're able to multitask on while the AI is responding, though I personally suspect that the context switching there doesn't actually lend itself to much efficient multitasking, at least not between high-demand tasks, probably just things like getting a coffee.\n\nBut I think that would still be a largely academic study with little real-world value. I personally would want to compare devs in a large existing codebase that they're familiar with, and include code quality metrics and QA feedback as metrics. That's supposed to be the tradeoff, and so any result other than AI being as slow or slower (a result most people don't expect) doesn't help much, since it doesn't tell you the price you're paying. I expect that to be a difficult study, since I would expect different types of AI use to have vastly different impacts on code quality.

And 2) I know that I am getting worse at writing and verifying tests on my own for lack of practice. \n\nThese are just issues in relatively insignificant avenues of use.

I was shocked at how it did it, but the code wasn't complete; it turned out that most things didn't work. The worst part was the code structure and understanding what was going on where. I think this tool is good for supporting and helping me understand certain things. It works well as a quick syntax check or name suggestion. I also use it for front-end generation because it's always a pain for me; I don't like HTML, JavaScript, and so on. But in my projects, I don't need fancy pages and flashing buttons; I want it to be as simple and readable as possible, so I often dump entire HTML/JS code structures into AI. Unfortunately, search engines like Google are pushing us to AI chats. It's hard to find tutorials for anything specific these days. Besides, I don't think they're being updated, I have that impression. For example, we want a tutorial on creating a login/logout page in Django, and I often find outdated solutions. It's better on YT, but ctrl+c ctrl+v won't work (although apparently no one does that :-) everyone always writes each line themselves :-))",

This is a for-profit company publishing a \"study\" on a product category that they have an interest in. That ALONE should be enough to discount it. \n\nI want to address this: \n\n> This seems to contradict the massive push that has occurred in the last weeks, were people are saying that AI speeds them up massively(some claiming a 100x boost), that there is no downsides to this\n\nThis is not the narrative I've been seeing. For me, I think the new narrative is more along the lines of \"It's a very powerful tool that you have to use intelligently, not just vibe code\". \n\nWhich this paper seems to be reinforcing. Here's a choice quote: \n\n> Among participants who use AI, we find a stark divide in skill formation outcomes between high-scoring interaction patterns (65%-86% quiz score) vs low-scoring interaction patterns (24%-39% quiz score). The high scorers only asked AI conceptual questions instead of code generation or asked for explanations to accompany generated code; these usage patterns demonstrate a high level of cognitive engagement\n\nThis is not a paper about how AI use can rot your brain, even though the headline would suggest so. This is a paper about how you have to use AI \"the right way\". \n\nI would *really* like to let my confirmation bias do the work for me - I think these tools are junk and a net harm on society - but basic skepticism says this paper really needs to be considered with a great deal of scrutiny.",

          "text": "Oh, boy. It's another round of reddit finds an AI paper that has a nuanced take on AI, and waves it around like a flag to justify their refusal to adapt to a changing world. You guys are starting to remind me of the people who constantly bitched about cellphones when they first came out or the guy who insists that everyone he meets hears about how he doesn't own a tv.\n\nIf you actually read the methodology instead of just the abstract, you’d see this paper isn't the \"AI is useless\" smoking gun you guys so desperately crave.\n\nThe study wasn't measuring senior devs churning out code they've written a thousand times and already understand. It was looking at novice workers trying to learn a completely new library from scratch.\n\nThe \"no productivity gain\" headline is misleading. The average speed was dragged down because some participants spent massive amounts of time (up to 30%) just composing queries and trying to get the prompt right. There was a group, the AI Delegators, who just let the model do the work. They finished the fastest.\n\n\nThe catch is that the pure delegators tanked the post-coding quiz scores (39%) because they bypassed the learning process entirely.\n\nWhat the \"AI kills coding\" crowd is missing is that it is possible to use AI while still building competency. The paper explicitly identified \"High-Scoring Interaction Patterns\" that preserved skill formation. Participants who used the AI to ask conceptual questions (Why does this work?) instead of just asking for code generation scored 65% on the evaluation, higher than the delegators and at comparable levels to the average of the no-AI group. People who asked for code and an explanation had high learning outcomes than all but the top end of the non-AI group.\n\n**The Generation-Then-Comprehension group actually scored higher on comprehension (86% vs 65%) than the non-AI group, although they did take slightly longer.** But the \"humans are getting lazy from using AI\" group didn't bother to read past the title and abstract of this study.\n\nThe breakdown is basically this:\n\n1. The Conceptual Inquiry group was faster than the non-AI group and scored comparable to them.\n2. The Hybrid Code-Explanation group was slightly slower than non-AI and scored slightly higher than them.\n3. The Generation-Then-Comprehension group was also slightly slower than the non-AI group, but scored the highest on comprehension.\n\nThe authors aren't saying, \"don't use AI.\" They're saying don't use AI to bypass learning. It’s evidence of what anyone in education could tell you. Cognitive offloading kills learning. If you treat the AI as a magic answer box, you stunt your growth. If you treat it as a tutor and stay cognitively engaged, you get the utility without the brain rot.\n\nThis isn't the slam dunk you think it is. It's a critical analysis of what works and what doesn't. But this sub doesn't care about that. They just have an emotional need to feel validated in hating AI tools.",

Eric S. Raymond for instance, reports shortening of programming tasks from weeks to hours, and says that AI use is now best practice for software engineers (implying that if you're *not* using it, you're not really doing due diligence as an engineer).\n\nHow does one square reports like these with an utter lack of lab data that suggest AI is not really offering much, with significant downsides? Is it an \"in mice\" thing where the conditions in the studies are such that real-world gains will not be reflected? Or is it the opposite—people are claiming false or illusory productivity gains without being systematic about analyzing the data?",

You save time on boilerplate, but you spend more time validating, debugging, and understanding generated code. If you don’t actively engage with the output, your mental model of the system definitely gets weaker.\n\nI think the real issue is how people use AI\n\n* If it’s used as a shortcut to avoid thinking → yes, skills degrade.\n* If it’s used as a collaborator or accelerator → it can genuinely help.\n\nThe “10x developer” narrative feels more like hype than reality. Most real gains happen when AI is used for:\n\n* exploring solutions,\n* summarising large codebases,\n* generating scaffolding,\n* catching obvious bugs, not blindly writing core logic.\n\nAlso, speed alone isn’t the right metric. Software development is mostly about understanding systems, requirements, and trade-offs. AI can generate code, but it can’t replace the mental model of the system and that’s exactly what this paper seems to highlight.\n\nSo I don’t think AI coding is useless or revolutionary. It’s more like a power tool, great in skilled hands, dangerous in careless ones.\n\nCurious how others here use AI without losing understanding of their codebase.",

Participants also self-reported using AI assistance in the no AI condition.\n\nFrom a pilot study. Funny and worrying at the same time. \n\nMore so about the study - it makes intuitive sense that the use of AI tools can hamper learning. I wouldn't generally recommend new programmers to rely on AI tools, and really I'd prolly recommend avoiding the use of AI tools altogether at least early on.\n\nFor measuring productivity; well, here they used a chat assistant backed up by GPT-4o. I don't think chat assistants are a very productive way of using AI tools for coding productivity. You really would want full IDE support. And GPT-4o is ranked quite low in comparisons of LLM models for scientific and coding tasks. The study itself says that they specifically aimed to observe information retention and comprehension, not productivity, and the study setup makes that quite clear as well.\n\nStill - Combining my anecdotal observations, and the current newest studies, I'd concur that many developers absolutely can end up doing tasks slower rather than faster with AI tools. There's an extra cognitive requirement for mapping the problem to AI and for e.g. writing prompts. And you still need to review what the AI is doing.\n\nSome studies have found productivity gains. It's nowhere like 10x. It's more like 1.3x. When you get those gains, I think there's some common factors; one is limiting the use of AI and primarily using it as slightly better auto-complete. Another is having kind of learned the sort of tasks that AI are good for, and recognizing the ones they are less good for or where the likely time gain is so little you're better off not. And third is using the AI as sort of a focus aid. Like now and then you really don't wanna do task X and you get started with it by prompting an AI.\n\nPersonally, I do think that becoming accustomed with AI tools is something most developers who haven't yet tried them should consider. They are improving all the time, after all, and smart experienced use of them can be a productivity boost. I find it unlikely that they are going to disappear anywhere, and I find it likely that as people get better in deciding when to use them and how to use them, and as those models improve, they do eventually become kind of a default that developers have running there, and others just don't use them much while other use them a bit more; relying on them fully is prolly a bad call tho, and not good for whatever project you are doing in the long term. Vibe coding has done nothing good so far, it's only caused massive headache by awful codebases being pushed into package repos and from e.g. open source projects getting unreviewable megasized pull requests opened on them.",

If you have access to the compromised binaries you can see where it was contacting to get the malicious updates. Which region is the server in, and has that IP been used for other attacks in the past?\n\nYou can also identify based on the time the attack occurred - what time-zone was it done in? If it was performed at 3am in China then it's not likely to be a Chinese group, but if it's like 1:30pm in Beijing, after time for some nice lunch? Much more reasonable.\n\nAlso, you can gather information by looking at the targets - what kinds of systems were targeted? Who were the victims? The article mentioned that the attack only affected certain targets, so you can gauge who the perpetrator was by what they had to gain based on who was targeted.\n\nYou can also look at the choice of targets and timing to correlate to in-world current events. Which targets were picked and why would that timing matter to various suspects?\n\nYou add all these little pieces of evidence up and figure out what the percentage chance of various attackers is.",

They could easily provide the evidence without disclosing any details that could allow identifying the victims if any or the kind of evidence you mentioned existed, no?",

The shared hosting server in question was compromised until the 2nd of September, 2025. On this particular date, the server had scheduled maintenance where the kernel and firmware were updated. After this date, we could not identify any similar patterns in logs, and this indicates that bad actors have lost access to the server. We also find no evidence of similar patterns on any other shared hosting servers.\n> 2. Even though the bad actors have lost access to the server from the 2nd of September, 2025, they maintained the credentials of our internal services existing on that server until the 2nd of December, which could have allowed the malicious actors to redirect some of the traffic going to https://notepad-plus-plus.org/getDownloadUrl.php to their own servers and return the updates download URL with compromised updates.\n> 3. Based on our logs, we see no other clients hosted on this particular server being targeted. The bad actors specifically searched for https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ domain with the goal to intercept the traffic to your website, as they might know the then-existing Notepad++ vulnerabilities related to insufficient update verification controls.\n> 4. After concluding our research, the investigated security findings were no longer observed in the web hosting systems from the 2nd of December, 2025, and onwards, as:\n>   * We have fixed vulnerabilities, which could have been used to target Notepad++. In particular, we do have logs indicating that the bad actor tried to re-exploit one of the fixed vulnerabilities; however, the attempt did not succeed after the fix was implemented.\n>   * We have rotated all the credentials that bad actors could have obtained until the 2nd of September, 2025.\n>   * We have checked the logs for similar patterns in all web hosting servers and couldn’t find any evidence of systems being compromised, exploited in a similar way, or data breached.\n>\n> While we have rotated all the secrets on our end, below you will find the preventive actions you should take to maximize your security. However, if below actions have been done after the 2nd of December, 2025, no actions are needed from your side.\n>\n> * Change credentials for SSH, FTP/SFTP, and MySQL database.\n> * Review administrator accounts for your WordPress sites (if you have any), change their passwords, and remove unnecessary users.\n> * Update your WordPress sites (if you have any) plugins, themes, and core version, and turn on automatic updates, if applicable.\n> We appreciate your cooperation and understanding.

The one thing that Windows does really well is the whole concept of [Authenticode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/authenticode), which makes it easy for the average user to know when to trust Windows installations from the internet.  The problem with Notepad++ is that for a long time they did not use Authenticode, and people trusted the binary installs despite the warning from Microsoft.  People felt safe doing it because everyone seemed to use Notepad++, which is exactly what made it such a nice target for state sponsored actors.  It was only starting in October last year that they started using proper digital signatures.\n\nNow don’t start yapping about Linux being better here, that’s just nonsense.  [Linux has had problems too](https://thehackernews.com/2016/02/linux-mint-hack.html), and btw, the Linux Mint compromise shows how futile it is to just post a hash of a binary as a replacement for proper signature checking (the hacker replaced the legitimate hash with the hash of the compromised version).",

He would assign tasks/work and give deadlines. I remember multiple times when I was working on a task, I would come to a proverbial fork in the road and a decision about how to approach the problem would come up that I could see affecting future programming work.\n\nI would meet with him, explain the problem and the different ideas I had to approach it and what I thought the downstream effects would be. I was hoping he could either give me an answer on what approach to take (whether it was one that I already presented or a novel one), or a rule of thumb to use, or really just any guidance so I could finish the task.\n\nInstead, he would waffle on the importance and criticality of making the right decision (which was obvious, that’s why I was there asking him instead of just doing what I personally thought was best) and that I should implement both ways and then gather data on how they worked so that I could make a data driven decision. Except 1) I was mostly worried about issues down the road, not immediate issues. I can’t gather data on future theoretical issues, and 2) it takes much longer to implement both solutions and then test them both than to just choose one. And he was the one who gave me the deadlines in the first place so he should know about them. I guess he expected me to crunch and work late to still meet them.\n\nAnyways, in order to preserve my evenings, weekends and sanity, I stopped asking him these types of questions and just went with the solution I thought was best at the time. Because if an issue ever arose that was caused by my design choice earlier, he couldn’t really blame me for not being able to see the future and anticipate the problem since I had justification for why I designed it the way I did.",

Which can and is totally fine! In the right environment, with the right people. I worked at a place where asking questions got you snide remarks and side eyes and \"omfg can you believe this guy\" and I learned QUICKLY to just shut the fuck up and better be thought the fool than prove it. It goes without saying these people were ass holes and some of them didn't like me too much. So any perception of not knowing- not good. Any bothering to get a question answered was met with \"how do you not know already\" energy, almost always.\n\nAnd that makes you go into survival mode... because getting fired can mean homelessness here in the ol' US of A, and quickly, with virtually no safety net of any kind to catch your fall. Better to take your chances and wing it and get it right/interact with A holes *less*, as opposed to bugging the powers that be even *more* and risking getting let go.\n\nIn my current job, it's all the other way around. I'm well liked, and consulted frequently for my expertise and opinion. They want my help as much as possible, and not knowing is *okay* in this environment. I don't have to survive. So I say \"damn, I have literally no idea... But I'm sure I can figure it out, that's my job after all!\" And with this group, that's seen as a strength. As a positive.\n\nIn the end it's not about avoiding humans. It's about avoiding ass holes. People don't like feeling stupid, being put down, or seeing they are thought less of, and all are possible when you \"interact with people,\" especially for contractors imo.",

And self confidence - where is one supposed to get this without being empowered to solve the problem!\n\nPeople in this damn industry really need to learn empathy and realize that not every question needs to be fully thought out.

Humans only seem to do that because they actually have a massive context.\n\nThis is actually a classic example of a problem with AI. When you tell an AI to do something, what prevents it from killing all humans to do it? Nothing inherently, you have to actually train it so that “killing all humans” is a massive negative in the reward function so it doesn’t land on that.\n\nBut then, what prevents it from putting all humans into a coma? You have to add that in too, there’s nothing inherent about a reward function that limits humans in comas as a negative.\n\nThis problem blows up because it turns out, in order to make an AI that actually “does the right thing” you have to encode the entirety of human morality into it up front so it doesn’t land on a choice that involves something horribly unethical. \n\nThis is not trivial and in fact, if AI was smart enough to figure this all out on its own, it would actually be able to turn us all into [paperclips anyway](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/ai-and-paperclip-problem).\n\nI’ll close by saying be careful what you wish for with regards to AI because the optimal solution to your problem most definitely involves killing all humans ",

          "text": "That's all well and good but most times i feel a programmer asks too many questions is because they were obviously not paying attention in the meetings.\n\nWe'll discuss something in-depth, as a group. The programmer will be quiet the whole meeting. Then, at some point the programmer will ask a vague question about what we just discussed and had resolved as a group 5 minutes ago.\n\nFor example, we'll discuss the DB to use for 35 minutes. We figure out that we can't use a simple BigQuery MV for our needs. We figure out the path to a solution which is a bit more complicated, but will work perfectly. We ask if everyone agrees or has ideas of why it might not work. No concerns raised. Even the programmer in question is nodding in approval, which is important because he'll be building this DB and system.\n\nOkay. Decided. We have the plan. Sweet.\n\nThen we start discussing how downstream systems will work with the info, and it's all aligned. Perfect.\n\nOh, Programmer interrupts someone else while they are talking. To ask a question.\n\n\"Where is the information being stored?\"\n\nHuh? We look around. No one knows what he means.\n\n\"So, in order for these downstream systems to use the data, it must be stored somewhere. I know this because I have worked in data for a long time.  You guys are lucky I caught this. Lol. We can't just use data. It has to come from somewhere and then  be stored in order to be queried. We can just use probably BigQuery. That's what I recommend. We should store the data in big query.\"\n\nIt's painful because not only has he not been paying attention this entire meeting, but also the system he works on is BigQuery and ALREADY HAS THE DATA.  We were trying to figure out how to get the data into something that will work for the use cases, which we just discussed and agreed upon. He agreed to it a few minutes ago but he doesn't have any clue what he agreed to.\n\nSo, one by one, he asks the questions which were already discussed in the meeting and the doc outlining the purpose of the meeting and how his own system works.\n\nMultiple hours later, we end up agreeing again to the same system that we had already agreed upon.  The programmer in question agrees to build the system. Again. I offer to create a doc outlining exactly what he agreed to build, if he needs it. He says he doesn't need the doc but would like it anyway, just so others can be on the same page as him. Okay.\n\nI create the doc. It outlines the entire plan we all agreed upon, beginning to end. I give it to programmer. It should take maybe three days. He says it'll take about one. Cool.\n\nThree weeks later, he's done. After heavy pressure from leadership.\n\nFucking A. He ignored the entire doc and created a MV in Big Query that accomplished zero of the use cases and based on the GCP logs, he created the MV one hour after leadership pressured him.\n\nAnd then we have more meetings, and he's asking the exact same questions all over again.",

You know enough about the tech to be able to make a set of clear requirements - and you could probably craft them so Bigtable would not be viable. And it sounds like you know enough to even outline a suggested solution. Just do that. Once you have these all you should have to do is give it to another team, align on dates, and after that move on. If your management asks you what a holdup is, you say you are blocked by that team and here are the dates. Once the date slips, escalate that shit up your management chain and let them talk to their management chain. \n\nThis guy sucks it sounds like but if they give you a solution that doesn’t meet your requirements, you just say that and it’s no longer your problem. Your boss or management needs to deal with it then. I’m not sure what your role is here but that’s how I’d deal with it.

How do the seniors handle questions? I remember my first job I would regularly ask questions like, \"Why are we doing it this way, instead of this other, easier way?\" 95% of the time there was a simple answer like \"Because that other way carries this additional risk\" or \"that method won't scale\" or \"this other technology we're using prefers this specific format\". Occasionally the answer was just \"No reason, I'm just more familiar with this method\", and a couple times it was \"That might actually be a better solution, we should look into it.\"\n\nI was fine with every one of those responses. The problem I've run into on some other teams is that some seniors take personal offense when you question them. But I also came to realize that this is usually because they can't actually answer those questions. As a result, they're usually pretty good at shutting down discussions.\n\nSide note - this is a separate issue from the more systemic issue of people being scared to ask questions because managers interpret questions as incompetence or otherwise use those questions against the person asking them. That's also a common issue, but it affects everyone, not just the juniors.\n\ntl;dr If you want juniors who ask questions, ensure you have seniors who answer them.",

Some consultant comes in and takes their work, they get dropped and the company carries on with everything they did. You don't own anything you do for a company.\n\nWhat I described is not the minimum expectations. I described the job as it was agreed to.\n\nWhen I offer $10 for a meal at a food shop, I don't expect the person to give me a bonus icecream to impress me and move up in the world.\n\nEmployment is a business contract. You agree to terms and get what you pay for. Thinking a company will reward you if you just bend over backwards for them and let yourself be extra-exploited more than everyone else is stupid. Not to mention a race to the bottom.\n\nMy time is worth something to me, if someone wants more of my time they can pay me for it. And I've done quite well, and held senior full stack development job roles. \n\nBeing a permanently on call, working unpaid overtime hours, wage slave, is not necessary. Be good at your job and employers will gladly accept your terms.\n\nAnd quite frankly I don't want a management level position. I see what constitutes as \"work\" for managers. Sorry I'd rather do something more rewarding.\n\nIf you have energy to do anything extra outside of agreed work hours you should be using that time to do contract work or build things that you own which can secure employment in other companies one day, build a portfolio, contribute to open source projects, etc.",

The family gets a call.  \"You mean he can't attend this meeting?\"  Someone told them \"Well.... he could I guess, but he's on some interesting drugs -- I don't think he can be held responsible for anything he says...>\"\n* Some orthopedic surgery is done and I happen to be in physical therapy.  \"You can't attend this code review?  Why not?\"  \"Well... \" I say, \"I suppose I could, but this nice lady here is bending me into unnatural shapes right now, and I might say things that HR won't like...\"\n* A coworker with kidney disease.... \"They want to know why I can't fly to an offsite for a day event...  I said I could if I had my own restroom or people didn't mind the bag\"\n* My employer had strike duty -- they tried to put on a boom truck -- given I'm blind, I protested.  It took an outside source and and lawyer to explain this might be a bad idea... but the press would love it.\n* A coworker in the same strike duty -- they wanted her to climb poles.  She agreed, but only if she could drop wrenches on our CEO.  I had to explain it wasn't the loss of the CEO that was the problem -- we could always get a new one -- but the wrenches were expensive.\n* My employer had a team building event somewhere, and we were all supposed to drive there, and policy said I couldn't order car service.  They INSISTED I had to drive myself.  I tried to explain.  Finally, I offered \"Sure!  It's a rental -- I'll even pay the CDW.  I wonder if I'll make it out of the parking lot before I total the car.  By the way, I have no license.\"\n* Years ago, my VPs of engineering were gems.  I say that, because the first just went to Burning Man one day, and never returned.  The second, his replacement, who was supposed to be better, was a Harold Camping (sp?) fan.  Thus, he believed, the world was going to end in 1994.  He told everyone too.   I was on good terms with the CFO so he asked \"Well, I guess I don't need to pay him anymore, or do we havea. company lockout -- I don't know...\"\n\nStrangely enough, this happens again and again.....  One of my most favorite ones was an offsite picnic -- one of those you'd better attend and have fun OR ELSE.   We're there -- a small child comes up to our CEO and runs away in tears \"Mommy!  He's dead!  He looks like Lurch!\"  I had nothing to do with this!",

We were using the same type and schema for two related things which, up until my most recent ticket, had exactly the same shape. When they suddenly had different requirements the change ended up rippling across way more of the system than intended.\n\nThe approach I’ve outlined for the future is that, when sharing types amongst different usages, it’s essential to determine whether the similarity between the types is a **coincidence** or whether it’s an **invariant**. When it’s an invariant, tight coupling is acceptable. When it’s a coincidence, tight coupling is undesirable. A single snapshot of the system is not usually enough to tell you which of these you are dealing with; these are properties of how systems evolve over time.",

I guess now you have isManager and isAdmin, but is it sensible to have a user which is an admin and *not* a manager?\n\nOr maybe you want to say isCancelled.  Ok.  If things are only ever cancelled or not cancelled, you will not regret this choice.  If you ever allow a thing to become uncanceled as part of a retry state, you will quickly find yourself managing multiple orthogonal fields.\n\nIt's fine say \"keep it simple\" if you are certain that your field exists in exactly two states and that will never, ever chance.\n\nNote that binary methods, which validate if you are in X state or not in X state, are probably fine.  Especially if \"cancelled by user\" and \"cancelled because too many retries\" are multiple states something can be in.\n\nBesides, if you have a state field which only has ACTIVE and CANCELLED, and you never actually go beyond those two states, what exactly do you lose?  A few bytes IF the field is properly packed?  The benefit of simplicity just isn't worth the future cost, IMO.  You don't get that much simplicity, DB field migration is the least fun kind of refactor.\n\nI'm pretty sure you can find \"don't use boolean fields\" articles at *least* twenty years old, for both DB fields and method params, so this is one of those lessons I suspect every generation will learn the hard way.\n\nOf course some, who have jumped from industry to industry, never maintaining their legacy code, will never learn it.",

And through my whole CS education I wanted to become that sort of craftsman I kept reading about, to one day tell these stories of the types of software I built, to mentor people in writing software, to work up and eventually become a greybeard in some area. It feels like since the moment I joined (and GPT stormed the world a mere month later), I've been watching that fade into a future excluded from the set of possibilities.\n\n\nCompared to that, I must confess I'm jealous that you had your decade-plus before it fell apart. Maybe I'll one day have my own stories or variety of craftsmanship, maybe it won't all fall apart after all. Maybe I'll no longer be directly touching any code in 5 years' time. Maybe in some sense this is no different than someone in the mid-2000s watching enterprise Java take the world, saying they wish they could have been one of the GNU hackers of the 80s and 90s.\n\n\nBut I do feel a grief for that loss, at least in this moment. And I thank you for the space and the words.",

I'm willing to take enough turns with it to get something useful, and when it does, it's amazing.

Most real world enterprise problems just needed functional, clean-ish, workman-like level solutions. Even before AI of the last 3-4 years, people in the industry already commonly complained how most jobs were just CRUD apps, in boring businesses... craftsmanship matters, but relatively little in such contexts, when CRUD was widely recognized to be a commoditized skillset even before AI.\n\nThere used to be a lot more blacksmiths. The individual craftsmanship mattered some, and some blacksmiths could charge more than others. But the Industrial Revolution made those small individual skill differences irrelevant, and the scaling benefits of mass production were too overwhelming -- when push comes to shove, craftsmanship has to justify itself against economic reality. The mass market will not overpay for commodity items, as they shouldn't.\n\nBlacksmiths didn't disappear entirely. But it's a smaller niche now. You can either do it as a hobby, or you can make a business out of it if you've got truly exceptional craftsmanship, or if you provide something unique that I couldn't just buy off Etsy or 3D print myself or whatever a substitute good might be. \n\nThere's nothing especially different or unique about software. We might've held on to the assumption that, the forces shaping meatspace would take longer to reach into digital spaces, but we were naive if we ever thought we were totally safe forever. It's sad, but IMHO it's no more sad than any other previous wave of capitalism transforming the way people live -- we don't deserve any more or less sympathy than blacksmiths did 200 years ago. \n\nEveryone should face the music. Some may choose to continue, and invest more in their personal craft and try to add unique value, to stay ahead of the curve somehow. Others will leave the industry. And some may stubbornly ride north, and I sincerely hope they find whatever measure of satisfaction fate can afford them.",

Sharpen a knife, which is like other knives, it's just not as good because it got dull.  I'm not sure there's a very good software analogy to that... delete the malware off your Windows 95 partition?\n\nAs a user of the tools, I care when they're small and sharp and not buggy, and if I'm going to need to alter them, I care that they're the same way internally.  But ultimately it's because I care about what I can do with them, the definition of \"well designed\" from the inside means it's a pleasure to bend them into some new shape I suddenly need now.  I'm not sure how that fits in with traditional definitions of craftsmanship, but I think the analogy just doesn't fit well.  No one is going to install your bespoke program in their living room and enjoy how it smoothly copies files around for years, unlike the cheap factory built `cp` commands which corrupt them.\n\nIn terms of personal satisfaction, there's work and personal.  Work things are for someone else's end, and while some of them are nice and some of them were not nice, and of course I'd rather work on the nice ones, in the end it just affects how much time it takes for me to do something for the group.  Whether or not things are nice kind of has to do with team dynamics and politics and history and all those things mostly not under any one person's control.  If people start flooding stuff with AI and you're not down with the style, it seems not too different from getting on a team where they just don't care about the things you do.  Maybe the article is saying the overall culture is moving towards enormous wobbly piles of jello and sure fair enough I think it is, that's been a constant theme ever since Rob Pike complained about cat coming back from Berkeley waving flags.  Sloppy AI code will contribute to it, but it's just part of an overall direction that's much larger.  I kind of hate that stuff as a normal user who has to use some broken bank website, but that's just life in the modern world, it's not really about programmers in particular.\n\nBut ultimately, all work things disappear the moment you change jobs, or even the moment you turn off at 5 or whatever and go home.  This seems pretty different from a cowboy who has a lifestyle, not a job.\n\nFor personal things, which is more like lifestyle and not job, feel free to not slop it up with AI if you don't like that!  That stuff no one else will tell you how to do, it only matters how much you enjoy doing it, and whether you can use it to do whatever it is you really wanted to do with it.\n\nI guess if you're a freelancer then personal and work is mixed, and say you feel you just can't compete writing by hand, then yeah that could feel like being left behind.  But once again, maybe you're in a field where the customer doesn't care about the insides, so long as it does the thing they want it to, and maybe that's to do with the field, in the same way as team culture mismatch.",

It's often just too tempting to try to prompt something into existence, and when it succeeds, it leaves me feeling empty because I know I did not deserve that outcome because I didn't think through it. I have lost motivation to work on personal projects and that makes me sad. I am also much less impressed with other people's personal projects nowadays if it's clear that any portion has used AI.

I have a feeling that vibe coding and co. might hurt programming as a hobny too, and I'm quite sad about it. That's because  the final product, the program, not the code, that an hobbyist can make is often inferior to what the newfound competition can achieve. \n\nDespite the hobby nature of the activity, creating something useful is often important. Although I might not care about *selling* the product of my labor, or my labor-force itself, I still care about it being used, at least by me or those who I care about. I knit a sweater because I want to wear it, and even if it's not as practical as the industry made ones, it's more beautiful (as an aside, I think aesthetic value in this context can be considered *use* value, as the product generates pleasure through its beauty). The same goes with woodworking or other creative hobbies, I want to use, or at least aesthetically appreciate, the product of my labor. If it wasn't the case, if I only created purely for the pleasure I take in the *process* of creating, I'd just destroy the creation and start from scratch every time, which very few hobbyists do.\n\nWith programming, achieving this is becoming harder and harder, at least for me. Yes, one can find pleasure in the aesthetic value of the code, or even in some aspects of the final program (e.g. visual design of an UI), but I think for most hobbyists, this is not the main purpose of the creation. I think most of programming, even at the hobbyist level, is about creating some useful.\n\nUnfortunately, I think AI is hurting this, as it is becoming better than me at creating useful programs. Not only it is sidelining me economically (not much in my case, programming is on my CV and helps a bit, but I'm not a professional developer), but it's also killing my motivation to create. And it's really painful.\n\nI might still write something more about the aspects, but this is the main point I thought about while reading your comment. What do you think?",

I find it needlessly obtuse and long winded sometimes. I've found that AI written code is kind of annoying to work with, unless you are using AI yourself.\n\nNow what is the big problem? I would say it is twofold.\n\n1. It makes our jobs faster, but dirtier. When you let AI handle the easy to do things, you have to pick up the things that the AI sucks at. I find myself going through really badly written code that is hard to understand. It sucks.\n2. AI's need training. They train on code that exists. Quality might degrade a lot over time.\n\nNow this isn't a big deal. Yeah the profession might be not as necessary anymore. You don't need as many horse breeders or farriers anymore either. But my concern is also that the job becomes worse. Instead of writing nice beautiful code the job becomes more digging through and fixing ugly poorly maintained code.

Will I still use it? Yeah, likely for help when I need to deploy something (it's surprisingly very good at deployment configurations) but for the software I develop? No way, not anymore. And this is kinda scary because I plan on making my own consultancy/startup, and I know \"not using\" AI could make me look like I'm lagging behind the rest, but at this point I value enjoying the entire process of development more than anything (not to mention that for some of the products I'm planning to develop LLMs don't know how to use certain libraries yet lol) and hell, I want my clients to know why certain decisions are taken: if I show them a bullet list made by an LLM, they are right to think \"why did we hire this bum instead of just giving an LLM what we needed?\", but I want to show people that experience from people is still insanely valuable (despite my short time in the career I've seen some things that would make most people want to retire on the spot and go open up a farm lol)\n\n\nI love the process and while I know I am \"hindering\" myself I hate the mentality of \"ship now and fix later\" because being honest that \"later\" almost never comes and people end up building on top of an already wrongly done base for their software. It makes sense to ship fast in a startup but hell, if I'm not going public, why bother lol",

By the time I left, 90-95% of the PRs were written by Claude Code. I legit had an existential career crisis when this realization hit me.\n\nOnce we knew how to use Claude at that level and knew how to get proper prompting/context generation/had documented the codebase *thoroughly* with a mix of our own documentation and Claude's generated documentation (which we reviewed ourselves), Claude absolutely chewed through features and fixes. We reviewed all the code ourselves, and it wasn't always perfect, but there was no question that we became significantly more productive and faster as a team.\n\nI really do think a lot of the people who say these types of things either work in really low level languages (assembly, for example) or just do not actually know how to make Claude Code work for your codebase properly.",

Admittedly that's not as far off as I would hope, but still. No matter how many idiots are in charge, there will still be folks with some sense (or at least with a solid fear of legal repercussions), who are building software that really matters, who will need people like me.",

Maybe you were trying to make the code reliable. Or maybe performant. Or maybe both. Or maybe it was important to be reviewable and just needed to be readable. And *none of those things have changed.* The role of beautiful and clever code hasn't changed.\n\nIf your boss has said \"please spew code out of the LLM and ignore reliability or performance\" - well, that's a business change. I see a lot of people who try to link this to \"craftmanship\" but the industry long term won't be able to sustain a bunch of buggy code that performs badly. Previous automation transitions were defined by lowered manufacturing costs - but with downloadable or web hosted software the cost to produce copies of quality software remains virtually zero. It's not comparable to when linen makers got overwhelmed by lower quality products because there is no bar to mass producing higher quality products.\n\nRegardless - if the problems haven't changed the need for clever solutions also hasn't changed. If it has - maybe that says more about the business instead of LLMs.\n\nI definitely get the feelings of \"years ago this used to take me days and now it takes me minutes\" but again I've been there a few times before.

          "text": "Okay here’s what I have to say: \n\nFirst OP: thank for sharing this! It’s vulnerable and honest and authentic and I appreciate you! \n\nNow I myself see programming like I see art or music. It’s something that you do because you must. It’s something you explore because you want to push the boundaries of what it means to be you. It’s a process that continuously answers the question: Can I do this? Maybe it’s improvising a new style of music, or maybe it’s learning how to paint in a more impressionist style. Maybe it’s learning assembler for RISC-V. But it’s about seeing how far can you push the boundaries on what you’re capable of. \n\nI think the problem is often that there are people who, for example, love to draw. But they decide to try and become a graphic designer instead because they think it’s the safe bet. Now personally I actually love design and based on the fact I’ve spent more time doing design than oil painting I can say that for now I like it better. But this example is about someone who loves to oil paint but takes the design job. It’s not their truth. It’s them dimming there light. \n\nWhen someone isn’t living their truth and dimming their light but with the understanding that this design job pays better that’s okay; as long as they want the money because raising a family is more their truth. But if it isn’t then they aren’t truly happy. \n\nSo let’s pretend in our example that our artist working as a designer does a lot of YouTube thumbnails as a freelancer. \n\nThen when AI comes along and all of a sudden they see themselves getting less and less work. \n\nThen they are pissed. \n\nBut why? \n\nI think the real reason is that they already aren’t living their truth. The already are taking work that didn’t fulfill them. So when that work leaves they are left with their original unfaced realization: they are an artist not a designer. \n\nIf they had taken the risky road of trying to be an artist that may have been harder. It might have paid poorly. But AI wouldn’t have had the same impact because they would just continue making their art. People who buy art - like actual oil paintings - aren’t suddenly going to buy prints of AI generated images. It’s a completely different experience. They want the actual art. For a variety of reasons none of which are affected by AI generated content. \n\nLikewise I think there are programmers out there that look at programming as something you only do for money in the context of a day job. \n\nBut there are, for example, indie game developers that spend years of this life creating the game they need to create. It’s an act of love. It’s an artistic expression. And even if the game doesn’t sell a zillion copies those that do buy WANT to buy it because it is the expression of one person’s vision. \n\nThis isn’t affected by AI generated code. \n\nLike vintage computer scene coders aren’t going to use AI to code their next Commodore 64 demo. There would be no point. The person is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, both on the platform and within themselves, and the people that enjoy running and watching those demos love that whole thing in the same way. \n\nNow I haven’t read the story but if someone does something they love and can live their truth then that’s beautiful. Other people will always respond to this. It doesn’t matter if the rest of the world drives cars. There are people who love horses and want to share that love with others. \n\nIf you do something you love and live your truth, and you don’t need the outcome of that work to bring in great wealth or status or meet some need to feel extra special, then living your truth is a reward onto itself. \n\nAnd if someone is pissed that they made good money doing something they don’t love and have to get a different job that they also don’t love… well then I don’t know what to tell you. \n\nChange is a bitch. \n\nBut to those who are, or want, to live their truth then the first thing that comes to mind is this song.\n\nA Harry Chapin song that goes something like this:\n\n“But music was his life, it was not his livelihood\nAnd it made him feel so happy \nand it made him feel so good\nAnd he sang from his heart \nAnd he sang from his soul\nHe did not know how well he sang, \nit just made him whole”",

Your craftsmanship is important only insofar as it generates value for the company. I'd argue that being a good craftsman does still generate value for the company regardless of AI, as long as the engineer keeps the end goal in sight. Many engineers sadly don't or can't.\n\n2. Many of the \"problems\" I run into on a daily basis should have been solved _ages_ ago, but we keep reinventing the wheel over and over. If AI actually manages to solve them then great, but it's plainly wrong to claim that we _needed_ AI to solve them in the first place.\n\nCase in point: most web applications serve some kind of tabular data and let you change said data, usually via some kind of modal window. That we haven't universally adapted automatic code generation for something like that is plainly hilarious.

Developers will be more like a line manager today, assigning tasks and reviewing work for their team of AI agents.\n\nThe skills we will want humans to have are the ability to decompose big problems into small ones, design interconnected systems that span more than one app. We will want humans to come up with products and features required for their customers.\n\nOn the whole, the industry will be better because we will stop doing the boring repetitive parts of software development. Only the hard creative and planning parts.\n\nSome places will not be heavily impacted by AI, mostly operating systems, embedded programming and console games.

LLMs already have a strong preference for whatever was most popular in their training data, so you get this feedback loop where popular packages get recommended more, which makes them more popular, which makes them show up more in training data. Smaller, better-maintained alternatives just disappear from the dependency graph entirely.\n\nAnd it compounds with the security angle. Today's Supabase/Moltbook breach on the front page is a good example -- 770K agents with exposed API keys because nobody actually reviewed the config that got generated. When your dependency selection AND your configuration are both vibe-coded, you're building on assumptions all the way down.",

If you keep your issues open to the public on Github etc., AI investigates those issues to resolve problems.  But I agree that the *programmatic interface* becomes a somewhat less interesting draw with agentic coding, since programmers will not feel so connected to the interface of your package. That said, they (at least I) might pick packages whose use they are more happy to review and debug.\n\nPersonally, I don't let AI go out and independently adopt new libraries *ever* — that's just begging to introduce vulnerabilities.  Most often, I point it at my existing repos and tell it to follow my prior choices. If I don't have a commensurate use case, I ask it to review the online debate around existing libraries and explore new ones to *advise me* on the pros and cons of each.  I would say that so far, its done a pretty good job the two times I've asked it to do this; once it brought my attention to an up-and-coming framework (it nicely put it as: \\[paraphrasing\\] \"use this if you are starting a new project, but there is no compelling reason to switch to it if your project already uses an older framework\").",

LLMs already have a strong preference for whatever was most popular in their training data, so you get this feedback loop where popular packages get recommended more, which makes them more popular, which makes them show up more in training data. Smaller, better-maintained alternatives just disappear from the dependency graph entirely.\n\nI mean, a few counterpoints:\n\n1. Standardization is good.\n\n2. Sprawl is bad, arguably worse than bloat.\n\n3. This is already the case, just look at any modern web frontend.\n\n4. This is easily - even trivially - managed outside of code. Linked libraries, container layers, compile time pruning, etc.\n\n5. Most of the security risks from a supply chain perspective are already fairly well understood *because* those libraries are already in widespread use.\n\nIf libcurl has a security flaw, the whole Internet has a security flaw, and that's a big part of why they banned AI-generated PR's and have a very thorough manual human review process. \n\nMost smaller single-purpose libraries are *also* full of bugs and vulnerabilities, and oftentimes questionably maintained/well maintained until they're not. And they're also way less likely to follow the CVE process and coordinate appropriately on fixes to minimize public risk, or respond appropriately when a high severity vulnerability is discovered.\n\nThat's not to say that big popular libraries *don't* have supply chain risks and day0 incidents and all that, or that there isn't some value of having a diverse ecosystem of smaller competing libraries - but I do think that it's a bit silly to consider the alternative to be more secure.",

Even if it isn't always correct, at least there is discussion and you can go do your own research from there. Definitely better than the average w3school or geeksforgeeks page.\n\nImo that's the crux of SO's fall. The discussion is more important than the answer.

Microsoft pushed it for a couple of years, and then it was abandoned\n\nSame with Adaptive Cards - a technology for dynamically building UI. When it was introduced, it was pushed heavily for a couple of years, even open-sourced, and then abandoned (though it’s still being developed quietly)\n\nThere is 90% chance that latest Widget Board would be abandoned again for whatever reason, but I have a cautions optimism here.

The bigger impact, though, is on quality rather than raw speed.\n\nI’ve found that AI tools have forced me to externalize my thinking. Instead of planning in my head and writing a few things down on sparse notes or diagrams, I articulate intent, constraints, and tradeoffs explicitly and early. Those are immediately stress-tested, researched, expanded, and clarified by the agent.\n\nActing as the driver has made me a better planner, engineer, and communicator. I still reject ideas when they are wrong, but that critical evaluation is now formalized in the updated plan instead of in my head. The result so far is work that is better thought out, better implemented, and significantly easier to explain to others. Overall, it’s leading to sturdier designs and fewer downstream corrections. So far anyway!\n\nI am still very cautious and I don’t give it full access by any means. Everything is still vetted by my eyes, and I always make sure to understand every concept it builds. I just didn’t have to type it all and spend hours pouring through random docs all over the place! It’s like having a team of super energetic, encyclopedic junior developers with good intelligence, average wisdom, and endless patience and drive. And the weird thing is, that energy has rubbed off on me somehow, renewing my vigor in the field. Made it fun again.",

How do you measure the value of not having a nuclear war? What is the value of not having the building on fire? What is the cost of having a down time? And if only 1 part of the system fails, how do we know it is going to cascade down without simulation? \n\nThe cost of such measurements are essentially also exponential in nature. It is nice sentiment I share with you. But finding an effect system to have some semblance of measurement of this is the real challenge.\n\nThere are options of using no measurements, but if we take time to explain to others who understand the system and measure the value of it, we would also create  extra work no one wants to do. And not having metrics for performance brings another set of problems as well.\n\nPractically having a standardized system that measures the value of individual is really the core of the issue in alot of our endeavors.\n\nAfter some thoughts, I am wondering if we look at things from another perspective, why is that engineer so valued? I think the reason why there is so much reward for the 'fixer' hero, is because systematic understanding is rare. And real time diagnostics is also a rare skill, because organization typically under invest in up keeping a real time documentation system for internal usage, and we do not test our systems under simulated failures enough. So maybe the under investment of testing and knowledge sharing is the culprit here.",

So when they go in to \"fix\" the \"disaster\", it's often just addressing the same said issue that they were warning about beforehand.  But instead of being allowed to fix it in normal working hours, they were forced to do it as part of an incident response.  And once in a while, you'll even get this backhanded \"hero\" label even when your stuff \"just works\" without any incident or user complaint.\n\nCalling someone a hero is often a cheap way for a manager to say \"thank you for fixing my mistake.\"  And everyone's resentment for the \"hero\" is often an example of Tall Poppy Syndrome.\n\nI'll give you a counter example.  I once had a bunch of product managers from other teams filing into my office one by one to complain that my product was a 100% solution when it should have been a 80% solution.  I pointed out to them my team delivered everything on time and under budget, and that every piece of functionality was carefully researched through user studies and backed by data that demonstrated the need.  I pointed out that we had planned for the operational needs before launching and that the product had a flawless uptime record over the next 12 months (it \"just worked\").\n\nMeanwhile, their projects were a year or more behind schedule, required tripled staffing, and they were pushing features that our users never asked for.  And their initial launches had to be rolled back in embarrassing scandals a week or so after launch because of severe bugs or scaling problems.  \n\nReality did not stop them from insinuating that my team had done something wrong.  We \"gold plated\" our project.  We \"squandered\" business value by pushing out something that was \"perfect\" instead of moving on as soon as it was \"good enough\". It was somehow our fault that their own projects failed.  \n\nAgain - I pointed out that my PM had brought in a UX researcher and we aggressively prioritized features based on user feedback.  And that the CEO of the company had personally vouched for the key features they were calling \"too perfect\" as a market differentiator for our company.   This only made them even more butt hurt.\n\nSo when you actually have the power to do everything the right way, instead of burning the midnight oil to fix the foreseeable problems you had warned everyone about -- they still hate you for it.",

                  "text": "It sounds like we’ve had very different experiences with how to actually operationalize teams. To me, the \"bus factor\" and \"on-call\" issues aren't just cultural side effects - they are symptoms of how a department is structured.\n\nWhen a system fails because one person is missing, that’s almost certainly a failure of leadership to enforce a consistent approach to best practices. You said you're new as a Sr Director, so this is your chance to be that leadership.  Especially with today's skeleton crews, you can’t just hope for quality; you have to build the appropriate standard of care into the daily workflows so the product doesn't rely on a single \"hero\" to survive.\n\nI actually disagree that the solution to on-call is to \"not believe in it.\" In my experience, you improve morale by taking on-call more seriously, not less. We treated the on-call rotation as a high-value engineering task.  That person was pulled from feature work specifically to triage logs, document technical debt, and conduct formal handoffs.  Handoffs were presided by a staff engineer or a skip level manager -- to give them the visibility they deserved.  If an engineer identified a bug or some tech debt during one of these meetings, the first thing you'd ask them is \"where's the ticket?\" because it was meant to get prioritized and sorted.\n\nBy treating that on-call as \"real work,\" we reduced error logs by orders of magnitude within months and drastically improved the MTTR for the entire department. We got to the point where we were finding and helping fix bugs in vendor platforms because our own internal \"noise\" was so low. One of my *frontend developers* was invited to a luncheon by our observability vendor and given an award for helping fix their agent compatibility on certain Docker container OS's. That’s how you actually eliminate the 3 AM page—not by ignoring the rotation, but by using it to aggressively burn down the technical debt that causes the fires in the first place.\n\nAs for the ETL/data issues, I've found that those teams often struggle because they aren't held to the same standards as the app dev teams. If 9/10 issues are coming from \"junk data,\" it’s a sign that the ETL process lacks the same rigor and proactive refactoring we expect everywhere else.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can’t just rant against the politics; you have to implement the processes that improve the working culture.  And you have to do it even though you know it's an uphill battle that will all get tossed to the wayside with the next set of layoffs.  You just do it.  And for what it's worth, everything I just described to you was completely fumbled when the best practices I introduced for my department were attempted at the company level, with people above my pay grade formed a committee to institutionalize everything I had done.  It eventually made me quit that job.  C'est la vie.",

And if the business did agree on that value/it was successful, that's a huge success you should absolutely be able to track and add to the engineer's performance review.  To be honest this is how I usually see promotions happening, when companies reward firefighters it's usually more reflected in bonuses/raises rather than title, it's something that gets a lot of kudos in the moment but what gets you up the ladder is a series of projects that didn't spontaneously combust.\n\nPart of the perception issue might just be that firefighters usually have to put in more time than anticipated, whereas if you're making good architectural decisions you can work smart rather than hard.  If making a safe building is already on the roadmap, you don't really get to claim you went above and beyond unless you took ownership setting the roadmap.",

          "text": "I am exposed to quite a few robotics companies. This is exactly the difference between the good and the bad ones. \n\n* The bad ones have to send either engineers, or at least firefighting technicians out with every robot. Maybe, some local firefighter can take over. You see these robots operating with a group of engineers crowded around either a few laptops, looking nervous and anxious, or you see them pulling at the guts of the robot which is sitting open infront of them. Always, the interiors of these robots seem very \"engineered\" at a glance, but then you start to ask, \"Why are there 3 rows of $200 each waterproof connectors inside the robot and cables with 50A carrying capacity where there should be data lines?\n\n* The good ones have a shipping department who hand their robots to a courier and forget it exists. They never hear any complaints from the customer, questions, etc. The thing just works. \n\nWhen you look inside the good robots, they are elegant as hell. Very few wires going anywhere, cheapest components possible (not cheap, just cheapest possible) etc. This because this robot was genuinely engineered. As in the engineers did their jobs. They didn't just blob together a bunch of barely tested experiments, which all promptly failed, which was solved by making those failure points thicker, faster, stronger etc. For example, why are there so many wires? Poor planning. Why are they so thick? Because of weird surges for unknown reasons; plus something was super noisy, so thick shielding. Why the waterproof connectors inside? Because water is getting in somehow. And on and on.\n\nExcept, when you are shipping a large volume of products, and want to keep increasing that volume, you can't be firefighting; if you are, it will keep you small.\n\nThere are some other costs to a heroics dependent company:\n\n* On-boarding is forever because you need to know so much to be useful. Often the heroics are required because of a giant legacy spaghetti mess where new people are told, \"Don't tug on that, you don't know what it is attached to.\"\n\n* The heroes are required to make progress with the software, but are also required for installs, and then for regular disaster maintenance, thus, aren't there to make much progress. This makes even development an exercise in firefighting.\n\n* As the OP said, that the heroics are rewarded. This is also because the company knows how screwed it is when a hero leaves. \n\n* This sort of culture comes from the top. So, even when a kind of break shows up managers would rather the heroes work on some manager's pet project rather than go back and shore things up with unit tests or something else. \n\n* Since everything is a crisis, people aren't doing much measuring. Thus, where are the bugs coming from, who really is a hero, how much progress is being made on the core product, why won't management fire Adam who is a giant misogynist and a crap coder?\n\n* Managers in such a culture become extreme micromanagers. Everything is a crisis, but they can't be the ones taking the blame. They are often being badgered to deliver this or that, in ever shifting priorities, because it will trigger payments which will let the company make payroll.\n\n* This last means you have micromanagers who are endlessly gantt horny, but at the same time, change what people are assigned based on the crisis of the hour. Then get angry that people aren't living up to the gantt charts, \"Yeah, I'm going to need you to come in on the weekend; you can't be letting the team down on this.\n\n* In a genuine attempt to stop the pain, these micromanagers will go from Agile, to PMI, to \"Hey I just watched a video on Prince2\" with the key that they won't adopt any system which doesn't have them as a micromanager.\n\n* Every jira ticket now has 800 fields because of all the above project management systems adding a few more with each failed attempt to implement them. The managers marked them all as mandatory.\n\nDue to the inevitable probability of some of the fires taking too long to put out, or even failing to put out, the company can't scale, a sales dry spell, a cancelled customer; the company will occasionally run into a cash flow wall. A cunning CFO can spin these plates for some time, but eventually, you will get a convergence of events which require another layoff. \n\nThese heroics companies will generally cough and sputter along for years and years, with a layoff about every 18 to 24 months. Then, they either merge or die. Often, the death is masked as a merger, in that one of their customers is so dependent upon their crap, that they demand they merge with one of their solid vendors, who then immediately begins a migration to software which works.\n\nAlong this path to death, they will occasionally have \"great success\" an opposing confluence of events where good sales, line up with lots of payments, and maybe some other bonus. The management start talking about doubling staff over the next 6 months as now they can \"grow\". This ends in tears. \n\nSome of these companies latch on like a blood sucker to some accidental profit printer. Now they can't overly screw it up. It doesn't mean they are any good, but that it is nearly impossible to go down the toilet with this profit factory hosing money into their pockets. Companies like this then fool people into thinking they've got their act together. All this means is that some decade a competitor will do things properly and eat their lunches.\n\nI find most of the red flags for these nightmares surrounds meetings:\n\n* Lots of meeting rooms with scheduling systems.\n* First thing stand ups.\n* Lots of people who's only job is to have meetings with developers. They produce no measurable value; but are paid well.\n* Pizza for people who work on weekends and evenings.\n* When people leave, hero or not, nobody really notices. This is like a house being on fire, people don't notice when the napkin holder catches fire as they try to fight the raging inferno in 8 other rooms.\n* Gantt charts and demands for highly detailed estimates on everything.",

The 'hero culture' problem compounds over time.\n\nWhat I've seen work:\n- **Make boring work visible.** Dashboards for code health, incident frequency trends, deployment smoothness. When 'nothing breaking' becomes a measurable achievement, prevention gets recognition.\n- **Reward documentation.** Not just 'write docs' but 'reduce onboarding time for the next person by X days.' Measurable upstream impact.\n- **Post-mortems that celebrate prevention.** 'We had zero incidents in Q3 because  refactored the payment service proactively.' Same spotlight, different behavior.\n\nThe hardest part is changing what gets discussed in 1:1s and promoted in calibration. If managers only surface crisis responses, that's what gets optimized for. If they surface 'Alice eliminated an entire category of bugs' with equal enthusiasm, behavior shifts.\n\nThe real test: what stories do people tell new hires about who's successful here?",

Thing is - it does not have to be disproved in practice, it only needs to retain the possibility of being disproved if certain evidence is ever found. The fact that such evidence is not actually found (especially when actively sought) serves to affirm our belief in that theory.\n\nWith that in mind - a good code may be easy to delete, but as long as it's not actually deleted we know it's good _and relevant_ code (because it's still needed in the codebase)",

We own them, but no urgent development is needed for them.\n\nTo keep things fresh, it’s multiple services running on top of  micro size instances of managed postgres in AWS. AWS has this nice feature where you can buffer disk I/O credits and cpu credits from when you need them, so can have the occasional heavy query still getting executed fairly fast. \n\nOn top of that they have made a bunch of terrible database crimes that cause full table scans all the time. As long as the tables are small enough, they stay cached in ram, queries are still fast enough and everything looks fine. \n\nOnce those table grow big enough though, each query causes part of the table to get evicted from ram, causing a bit of I/O on disk. \n\nInitially it just uses part of the buffer during office hours and then the buffer refills. \n\nThen people working late start getting timeouts because the buffer is empty. After they stop working for a bit, and report it is down, it starts responding again.\n\nThen things start timing out during the late afternoon working hours, but redeploying things helps. And when you check things out in the morning, everything runs fine.\n\nBefore x-mas we took a closer look at one of the services, and found a routine that look for things added in the last 5 mins, but the timestamp column doesn’t have an index on it, so it needs to scan the entire log table.\n\nThis week another of these services started doing the same thing, so we immediately looked at the database. The entire service consists of storing ‘items’ with their ‘itemlines’.\n\nBrainiac A decided that a many-to-many relation was the right implementation for this. \n\nBrainiac B decided that when you need to lookup all itemslines by item id, the correct way was to go though all the item lines, join them to the item-to-itemlines table, and then filter out any itemlines where the item id on the item-to-itemlines entity didn’t match the item id you are looking for. There is a covering index on the item-to-itemline table that would solve this with a lookup, but they managed to write the C# code in a way that ensured that EF didn’t use it by accident.",

How long is the wait for each update? I'd expect waiting for a single update on any reasonable configuration to take like at most 2ms or something of that order, or say 500 updates per second. Not great, but it'd work. Even if we'd assume much worse performance at 50 updates per second, why would that take 5+ minutes? Do they really need to update 50 x 5 x 60 = 15,000 users? Or is there any reason a simple user update takes about 20ms?\n\nGiven that the bulk operation completed in 300ms I'd say there's probably something else going on that slowed the updates in that loop and that the loop was just the place where it had the biggest visible impact",

Thousands of lines of code.\n\nBut it was the very first part that caught my attention - it took a batch of records, and then did ‘foreach ( Record record in batch ) new Thread(handleRecord, record).start() ‘.\n\nIn other words, it spun up one thread for each record in the batch, of which there could be hundreds or even thousands. I’m sure it worked fine for the guy’s three-record test code, and then choked on real data.\n\nI replaced it with ‘ThreadPool.start’ and it went from fifteen minutes to about thirty seconds. Maybe an hour of work, 99% of which was just figuring out what was going on. That was a pretty good day. ",

This worked fine when there were only 3 test items in each drop down but when there were several hundred and 5 or 6 drop-down on a screen it started to take significant time.\n\nI wrote a routine that took the list, turned it into a DOM object once and provided that object to the UI to use directly.  Screen transition went from 30 seconds to effectively instantaneous.  It was a simple fix but nobody had thought to try the UI with anything other than toy-data and the code review didn't catch the wildly inefficient design.\n\nThe exec's were thrilled with the miraculous fix and I was a hero. :-)",

In my opinion the people who think that what agents produce is 'good enough' are the people who have no love for the craft at all and just quite simply don't care. 'As long as it works I don't give a damn' type of folks. But if you're anything like me, someone who really cares about the quality of their work, and about their own personal growth at the craft, it's all kinds of gross.\n\nPersonally I've decided that LLMs are great learning tools, being able to not only search for information but ask questions, bounce around ideas, describe things and get them automatically expanded upon or summarised, etc, is very handy. It's now an additional tool in my toolbox along with various docs, websites, books, youtube channels, etc. If I need to learn a new language, it is very handy to be able to ask it something like, 'Show me a simple Hello World in this language and explain each line'. I think that's a good use for the tech.\n\nAnd for coding tasks, if I use an LLM for actual code it's for what you said, small discrete tasks. A template of something, a single function, a test, etc. Or simple text edits. \"Translate all the English words in this HTML into French\" \"Generate a simple CMake Template with these requirements: \" \"Write a function to convert an RGB colour to a HSL colour\", etc. Small tasks, so I can review the results, adjust them if needed, and add them to a project.\n\nI'm always watching the output carefully, and also trying to keep the number of times I use it somewhat low. I'll use it for speeding up tedious tasks that offer me no great learning experience when I'm on the clock, but if I got the time to do something myself, and it's 'actual proper coding work' that could help me personally keep growing my skills or at least practice something I haven't done for a while, I'd rather do that myself. All skills are perishable, you use them or lose em, I don't want to rely to LLMs to the point that I start to forget how to write code.\n\nAnd if that makes me 'old man yells at cloud.jpg' then fine, I don't care.\n\nI look at some folks who talk about letting coding agents go ham on their whole repositories, even doing commits, writing absolutely everything, with no guard rails, generating stuff that's full of technical debt, bugs, and not giving a damn, spinning in their chair while the water supply of an entire lake is consumed by a data centre somewhere generating tens of thousands of lines of junk code, while they don't bother to learn a single thing at all about coding and I just think... if that's what being a developer means in the future, I'm going to have to start introducing myself as something less embarrassing, like maybe a used cars salesman, or drug dealer.",

No \"are you sure?\" No \"have you considered...\" Just enthusiastic execution. \n\nThat lack of friction is exactly what makes it dangerous. It feels like progress because nothing's slowing you down. \n\nBut nothing's checking you either.\n\nOne thing that's helped me: before accepting complex AI code, I ask it to explain what it wrote back to me. Not as a test for the AI. As a test for me. If I can't follow the explanation, I don't understand the code well enough to own it.\n\nSounds obvious. But when you're in the \"just 5 more minutes\" loop, you skip it. You accept because it looks right and the tests pass.\n\nThe abstraction bloat thing is real too. AI will scaffold 1,000 lines where 100 would do. You have to actively push back—\"couldn't you just...\"—and it immediately simplifies. But if you don't ask, it won't offer.

If you fire the whole QA department, the software won't automatically break the next day or the next week.

That seems reasonable for it to be a product call, as usually they can evaluate that with similar insight as an engineer.\n\nWhat they can't assess easily is the quality of the code base.  But often engineers speak of quality as something separate from business value.  It's not: as Martin Fowler points out, quality allows you to build faster and with fewer bugs.  The difficulty is that it's often hard to directly measure and you may have to use strong anecdotes and some degree of trust.  But there are projects where you can measure fairly directly: pipeline velocity, defects per engineer per month, and such.\n\nSometimes I use sharpening the axe as an analogy.  Yeah, maybe I can bludgeon the next tree down and maybe even faster than it would take for me to sharpen my axe and cut this one tree down.  But I know you want me to deal with the whole forest and it will be faster if you let me sharpen my axe first.\n\nAI has been interesting and you might be able to use enthusiasm for it to your advantage.  AI rarely gets it right at first and benefits from fast iteration cycles and extensive test coverage with useful feedback.  It also benefits from good documentation and names that make sense.",

          "text": "There are a few issues: \n\nOne is that you often have to work within a pre-existing codebase or system and often the quality is really bad. So there's not much you can do at that point, because the changes you're making are usually quite small.\n\nThe other problem is that the few times that you might be asked to build a new system from scratch, often the deadline is really rushed for some reason. For maintaining old code, often the deadlines are quite relaxed or non-existent, but for building a new project from scratch, managers always seem to want really clear timelines and then they check in with you constantly and basically apply a lot of pressure. Maybe part of it is that they know that maintenance development is less desirable, so they feel compelled to treat you nicer, whereas new development is more desirable so they feel like they can pressure you more without you leaving. Idk.\n\nAnd the final issue is that on these new projects, often your teammates will sort of go insane, they may have never really gotten the chance to write much code from scratch, so they almost go into this mania where they're writing tons and tons of code, like the sheer act of typing in the code is the goal for them and they create these super verbose codebases with tons of boilerplate, pointless tests, every wacky abstraction they read about in a book, every obscure language or framework feature, etc. It's almost an orgy of coding where the codebase just explodes with thousands and thousands of lines of this stuff.",

What's the issue?\" The bigger the company the more efficiently and perversely it will optimise for max Y in unintended ways.  \n  \nThe example that always sticks with me is London in the early 2000s, when the government was under pressure to reduce the abysmal lengths of time people were waiting in A&E (ER) before being triaged/seen by doctors. So they introduced a target: hospitals would be rewarded based on the proportion of people arriving at A&E who were seen, treated and discharged within a four-hour window. The aim being more efficient hospitals and better public opinion. A couple of ways in which hospitals made progress towards the goal that are arguably unintended: \n\n* Cancelling non-urgent operations so that extra staff could work in A&E when performance was being measured (increasing waiting times for elective surgery across the board).\n* Keeping patients just outside A&E in ambulances so that they didn't technically \"arrive\" until the hospital was confident that they could meet the target (leading to increased ambulance response times).\n* A near doubling of the number of patients who happened to be discharged from the hospital within the last 20 minutes of the window.

The metric in that case was the amount of time between when an order was finalized - ie when the cashier collected the money - and when it was cleared off the order screen. This was intended to measure the amount of time it took to fulfill the order, but of course we figured out pretty quickly that nothing stopped us from clearing the order whenever the hell we wanted to.\n\nWas always fun getting praise from the owner when he'd drop by.",

One classic case is parking norms scaled to handle black friday parking, which means that even on the one most bonkers day of the year there's still capacity _in the parking lot_ (what goes on inside the store is someone else's problem), and the remaining 364 days of the year, the parking lot is grossly oversized and underutilised, and in some cases the parking lot winds up being so big that people spend more time walking between their car and the store than people do between their home and the shop in a walkable urban neighbourhood.\n\nOr scaling highways to be able to deal with holiday traffic, which then either leads to them being oversized the rest of the year, or induced demand, which eats away the gains (and a lot of other stuff).\n\nAt least in software there's _some_ awareness around setting goals for stuff like p50, p90 and so on, and that wanting too many nines comes with its own costs.",

Sometimes those comments are straight up \"this doesn't even work at all\". Though the most useful comments are the ones that catch subtle issues that might cause a problem that may evade detection until the change hits prod.\n\nSome people seem to treat code review as if you just skim the code for blatant badness, rather than genuinely understand the code. As well, sometimes people seem to only review the code in the literal sense of the changes only, without considering the big picture implications of how it interacts with the rest of the system. For example, I have some areas of my codebase that must be reentrant (as the code must be able to resume when it gets interrupted), yet it's common for authors to write code that is not reentrant and for reviewers to fail to consider it.\n\nOf course, ideally code would have as few gotchas as possible, have CI systems to ensure it's safe, etc, but it's impossible/infeasible to cover everything, so human reviewers need to be good.",

I deployed OpenClaw on my own VPS and the first thing I did was frame the entire setup as a prompt injection target — because every incoming message on Telegram/WhatsApp is an injection surface.

I am curious to see new technologies work, so I spin up a VM, test the thing, decide if I think it's cool, and then delete the VM.\n\nI'll admit I get pretty worn out about security. I have to deal with enough security at my day job, with the 10,000 alarms that go off every time every PM needs to apply to the background check to get added to an entitlement to access a repository that let's them see the branch of the build of the feature they asked for.\n\nThe remote-only PMs are all jealous of the local PMs that can just physically walk up to my desk and look at the build with their eyes, without having to fight the eternal, adversarial security war against their ability to do the most basic parts of their jobs.\n\nEvery time I read all the docs and go through all the trainings, every security process I've learned how to do seems to be obsolete before I even finish learning it.\n\nI'm increasingly suspicious that the people who drive security decisions aren't actually intent on making any forward progress; maybe they're just leading us around in an eternal loop of endlessly changing processes, so that all data leaks are always a failure of engineers not following the latest protocol, no matter how hard the engineers try to follow the latest protocol.",

Because one key factor is the theory built between people. If we keep switching people around, or we keep switching targets, or teams or goals, it gets hard to get good at anything, or get any vision of where you are doing. You begin to to thrash, stumble, flail and then burn out as you never see anything you do have success, you never get closure and never leave the stress fight-flight.\n\nFinally impossible dead lines. Note that I am fine with impossible dead lines as long as everyone agrees they're impossible. Moon-shots or stuff like that. Where the goal isn't to achieve it, but to see how much you can achieve. Honestly timeboxing tasks into time way too short to finish it, but enough to get a gist of it being worth to invest the whole time or not is super useful. But I'll take it for what it probably is meant as: impossible *expectations*. That's just setting yourself up for failure and frustration. You may do the most amazing thing you've ever done in your career, and you'll have someone listing how it felt short (even if no one else would ever have gotten closer) that's just deflating. If we celebrate how far we made it, then I can be inspired to push a little bit further just to see where we can end up.\n\nAI is a tool, you use it or not. If it scares you, that's fine, it's a scary moment where we need to rethink our careers. But it's part of the ever changing world of tech. The only issue is if you're being forced to use it, or forced to use it in bad ways, but that isn't AI, that's *bad management*. Toxic Coworkers are a pain, but you can avoid them and let them sink on their own, the only issue is when you're forced to deal with a toxic coworker in a toxic manner and are forced to not use any recourse against the situation, but that isn't the toxic worker, that's *toxic management*. So again, really bad management is the core issue (because impossible deadlines are bad management, and turnover is a management strategy).",

              "text": "In my experience the issue is *every single time* a misunderstanding and abuse of inheritance and the *\"is-a\"* relationship, including with OP's example. They start off with the \"you should model real world\" rule and then they fail to do so and then blame the tool.\n\nThe problem is that just because something *is* something else **in the English spoken language** doesn't mean that it *physically is* that thing as well. For example: My coffee mug *is* red in everyday spoken language, but in reality my coffee mug itself isn't the color \"red\", rather its surface material *has a* color attribute with the value of red. \"Is-a\" vs \"has-a\" is a surprisingly good rule when tackled from the *physics* point of view and not from the English language pov.\n\nIn OP's case the blog post starts off with \"both employees and managers are humans, so let's create a Human base class\" which is already terribly wrong. When a new company hires me, or when I simply change my position in a company, I don't suddenly physically morph into an entity of a different class in the real world. No, I'm the exact same human being and simply my *role within a company* changed. When modeling the real world I'm still a human and not some worker entity, my work isn't my identity.\n\nA better way would be to have a Human class with a *roles* attribute, and both Employee and Manager would be *roles*. Then you could just change `someHuman.roles.insert(new Manager())` or whatever.\n\n**But even that is incorrect,** because physically and biologically a human being doesn't have a list of \"work roles\" when it's born, rather it's a flexible being that can do any number of various tasks at various times. No, it's actually the *company* that cares about my role:\n\n    class Human {\n        Date birthDay\n        Decimal height\n    }\n    \n    class Company {\n        // Just one way to model it, but now these can contain duplicates.\n        List<Human> employees\n        List<Human> managers\n    }\n\nThere, problem solved.\n\nNow this is often overkill and you notice that you don't actually want to model the real world too accurately because it would lead into a lot of extra work and code (because real world ~~is complex~~ has high complexity), but at that point you need to draw proper domain boundaries and not blame OOP for your bad choices.\n\nFor example, from an accounting perspective you don't actually care if the workers are humans in the first place, for all you care they could be aliens or robots. What you really care about are the *contracts* and *identification* (like SSN) and the *roles within the company*. At this point there is zero reason to try to model a biological *Human* into your code anymore, and thus you once again get rid of the inheritance problem.\n\n**TL;DR:** It's not the tool that's broken, it's the users.",

Readable AND open to optimizations to make it super fast if needed (which wasn't a goal for this particular exercise). Better than what I had cooked up myself on the first pass, at any rate.\n\nThere's also the [refterm](https://github.com/cmuratori/refterm) codebase, which I haven't checked in detail, but that's also at least a more realistic-sized example for his approach.  \n\n> Just look at the source code of DOOM or Quake.

The author’s “prickly” attitude and eagerness to trash on reasonable concepts aren’t doing the post any favors.\n\nAside from the style, the contents of the post provide pretty mediocre advice. \n\nWe all know that overuse of inheritance hierarchies is bad. That’s nothing new. Neither is the idea that one should wait until there are multiple examples of code being used before trying to generalize them.\n\nWhat’s unusual in here is the idea that good code is code which has been compressed as much as possible. An interesting idea! Which I have seen go wrong many times.\n\nThe approach of removing duplication wherever possible often leads to tight coupling between conceptually different things. Textual similarity between multiple pieces of code is not a good enough reason alone to try to unify them under a single abstraction, because things which have been unified in this way are now coupled. Uncoupling them later if the need arises is frequently harder than if they were never combined at all. To borrow a phrase, “No abstraction is better than the wrong abstraction.”\n\nHow do you know when this unification should be performed? By thinking about the concepts behind the code. What forces are in play, what the code _means_, how the code has evolved up until this point, what your project manager has in your backlog, etc. This doesn’t mean preemptively building a framework to account for all of these things; it means deferring decisions which are hard to undo unless you have a reason to believe that they won’t need to be undone. This is exactly the kind of thinking that the post is mocking.\n\nFinally,\n\n> The fallacy of “object-oriented programming” is exactly that: that code is at all “object-oriented”. It isn’t. Code is procedurally oriented, and the “objects” are simply constructs that arise that allow procedures to be reused.\n\nThis is laughable and expresses an extremely limited perspective on the wide range of ways which code can be structured and understood.",

Unlike mermaid, you can choose the layout of the diagram. (mermaid gets kinda ugly sometimes, at least the flow charts do.)\n\nIt runs in the browser, so it's universally accessible from all devices (not sure about mobile usability TBH).\n\nIt can export an image, so it can be used in documentation.\n\nIt can export as SVG, which means you can have links and other rich metadata in your diagram.\n\nAnd the real killer feature that makes me pick it as my favorite is that you can embed the draw.io metadata _in the image itself_, so you can import the PNG or SVG back into draw.io for further editing.\n\nSimply an amazing tool. I'm honestly surprised it's not mentioned here.\n\nMermaid is better for some things though, e.g. sequence diagrams.",
