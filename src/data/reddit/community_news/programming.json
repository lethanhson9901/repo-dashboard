The problem was the machines required significant amount of operator engagement due to keeping tolerances to one to two microns.   Management thought the much smarter machine meant that they could get by with marginal human beings.   The reality is the ability to understand the technology of the device being machined was required even if the machine itself did much of the computational work.   AI, at this stage, is in the same situation, management thinks of it as the best thing since sliced bread.

The [manual bit-mask implementation](https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler/blob/main/src/frontend/parser/ast.rs#L369) is actually insane. A number of crates do that for you. **THEN** Manually implementing [std::fmt:*](https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler/blob/main/src/frontend/parser/ast.rs#L350) crap. All because claude never actually made or used an abstraction around bit-masks, so they have to glue it together manually. \n2. The whole AST copies every text fragment into individual buffers & re-allocates them. Rough parse trees are literally ideal for `&'a str` or `Cow<'a,str>` (references to the source file) but most LLMs really **really** struggle with lifetime management. It is wild because the \"file\" is kept allocated the whole time as [spans](https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler/blob/main/src/common/source.rs#L3) are just byte offsets into the text. It also can't handle >4GiB source files, which `cl.exe` does now (and has for ~10 years), so this just sad.",

As far as the big tech companies are concerned that's all they are needed for.\n\nGo look up Eric Schmidt's talk at Stanford where he tells all the devs in the room (I'm paraphrasing from memory here) \"You guys should be telling your AI to clone TikTok and attempt to go viral and if it fails, try again a few days later.\" He even goes so far as to tell them not to worry about the illegality of it all because if it succeeds they'll have more than enough money to pay good enough lawyers to fight it out in court.

People writing code have rules and regulations. You can't work on a tiktok clone if you worked on tiktok code. On the other hand, they can apparently still train a bot on stolen or leaked tiktok code, and have it generate the \"new\" code with the exact same requirements. That way you can fire both teams and replace them with a single chatbot (which I think is the main motivation for them). \n\n\n> He even goes so far as to tell them not to worry about the illegality of it all because if it succeeds they'll have more than enough money to pay good enough lawyers to fight it out in court. \n\n\nI dare you to tell it to make a Pokémon clone.",

They've got that shit down, and have done for over a year now.\n\nAs someone who has been doing this for a very long time and currently gets no speedup by using LLMs to write code (except as a search tool for docs), the point where I'll consider using an LLM to write code for me will be when:\n\n1. I have the option to run it locally, or at least self-hosted on a general purpose cloud platform, meaning no one can deny me access to it, and...\n\n2. Its rate of getting things completely wrong (in everything but the smallest and most textbook-ass trivial tasks that I can do in my fucking sleep anyway) goes down from the current 60% or so, to perhaps 5%. I think if I only had to rewrite 1 in 20 lines instead of more than half, that would be about the threshold where the LLM would go from an irritation to an actual timesaver.\n\nFor now, the very high error rate and the proprietary nature of the LLMs that suck the least make it hard to be impressed with any of this.",

You can browse around the code in this module a bit and it just gets worse and worse.\n\nAnother example:\n\n[https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler/blob/main/src/driver/cli.rs](https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler/blob/main/src/driver/cli.rs)\n\n            let binary_name = std::path::Path::new(&args[0])\n                .file_name()\n                .and_then(|n| n.to_str())\n                .unwrap_or(\"ccc\");\n    \n            self.target = if binary_name.contains(\"arm\") || binary_name.contains(\"aarch64\") {\n                Target::Aarch64\n            } else if binary_name.contains(\"riscv\") {\n                Target::Riscv64\n            } else if binary_name.contains(\"i686\") || binary_name.contains(\"i386\") {\n                Target::I686\n            } else {\n                Target::X86_64\n            };\n\nI was initially confused why the \"src/bin\" directory has identical main functions for each seperate compiler target binary. Tracking down where the compilation target option variable is set, confirmed my suspicion. Claude literally just uses the filename of the binary at runtime to decide which architecture it should compile against. This is the kind of thing that nobody even thinks to write a test for, because no human developer would do such a thing.",

It's not the sort of error a human would make, it's only a single character bug, and only happened occasionally. I was just lucky to spot it. It was just in benchmarking code, so nothing critical, but the idea of people using these tools without reading every single line carefully is terrifying. It could easily vomit up an extra semicolon in the wrong place because it came across such code in its training data and it would be very easy to miss on review.",

The \"we need to use AI! You're using it but not going fast! GO FASTER!\" - so the general business idea of \"move fast and break things, and we will ignore the tech guys because AI! AI! AI!\"\n\nCross that with lazy developers or vibe-coders who talked themselves into a job (many a complaint in AI subs - junior devs who just use AI and don't understand it).\n\nI think my biggest issue with AI? No one is teaching how to use it properly. They're listening to the LinkedIn Sinfluencers about \"omg junior devs - don't waster your time on _coding_ learn business management and marketing other business tasks because you can **just** prompt AI to build things now!\"\n\nThat creates developers who create AI code and then do not know how to debug it. Or even understand it. Or even think beyond this feature implementation. A total lack of \"complete picture,\" which… I think falls back to lack of mentoring.\n\nI keep reading about developers complaining about a new junior that \"doesn't know anything and doesn't do things how they want\" while ignoring - it's their _first fucking job_ and _they need to learn by your example_ which means _teaching and mentoring._\n\nI have seldom ever worked with an engineer that hits the ground running day-one, because even _experienced_ engineers need to acclimate to new processes and possibly new languages or patterns. \n\nSo:\n\n- don't trust AI\n\n- but if your developers are using it, maybe teach them how to use it better\n\n- and if you come back with \"but my boss/boss's boss/C-level won't give us time\" - then is that _AI's fault_ or a _leadership problem?_\n\nJust like how Tech Execs would insist the new multi-million dollar software they bought will solve all their problems - AI is in that same bucket of suckering them in without them actually understanding it, and developers are getting frustrated because of it.\n\nBut I guess that's preaching to the choir, here.",

AI code looks clean on the surface but has these subtle logic errors buried in it that take longer to find than just writing it yourself would have.\n\nThe real issue nobody talks about is that verification requires the same skill level as writing the code. So youre not actually saving senior dev time, youre just converting it from creation to review. And review is harder because youre working against someone elses assumptions without any of the context for why those choices were made. We've started requiring AI generated PRs to include a written explanation of the approach before any code gets looked at.

Computers work because there are strict rules ~ the code cannot be fuzzy. It must be exact ~ it must be algorithmic. Computers are not magic ~ they need instructions.\n\n> Any computer related technology you want to deploy that is only safe as long as the humans are perfectly reliable at verifying it 100% of the time, is not safe. We know this. That's, again, a big part of why we invented programming in the first place.\n\nWe do not \"know\" any such thing. Good technology is designed and architectured to minimize faults, and allow for easy troubleshooting if there are errors. Software can never be 100% reliable except if it is simple and focused, with any cruft cut away. There's a reason why banks rely on ancient, yet reliable COBOL code, and space shuttle software was written carefully and with focus, because it was not allowed to ever fail. So humans can write reliable code. Or we used to, before skills and knowledge began to decay.\n\nCertain programming paradigms also make it much harder to reason about code, introducing lots of strange errors and slowness. OOP is one such paradigm that has had disastrous results. Layers of indirection via classes and virtual functions has been a disaster for debugability. It makes it really difficult to figure out what is doing what at a glance. Functional programming has also caused problems, because you have to fundamentally alter how you code to make it fit within that model. OOP has that too, but functional programming is very weird in its own way.\n\nThe best code is that which is written closest to how a computer functions ~ not talking assembly, which is too low-level. I'm talking stuff like C, Zig, etc, which keep to the basics without adding unnecessary and mentally-straining abstractions, but allowing you to write very complex code as needed, abstracting as you the programmer desire, such that it fits your mental model, allowing you to reason more easily, because they're your abstractions.",

Early hardware used electromechanical relays.  Something like a Zuse Z1 took dozens of seconds to do a multiplication.\n\nAt peak, the US military employed thousands of people that could work in parallel.  And problems like artillery tables are embarrassingly parallel because the calculation of one trajectory doesn't depend on the conditions calculated in any other trajectory.  So the humans actually had significantly higher throughput in aggregate than any of the earliest such machines, and humans were available in much higher numbers - especially during wartime materials shortages.  But reliability was an issue with thousands of humans doing work by hand and consulting books with things like logarithm tables which had themselves all been worked and typeset by hand.  Reliability of the work rather than just latency was the initial driving force in R&D before everything switched to fully electronic vacuum tube based systems that could have MHz speed clocks.  After all, it didn't really matter if it took a day or a week to issue the tables for a new model of gun.  But a lot of your people would die (and a lot of the wrong people wouldn't die) if you shipped a new kind of artillery with incorrect documentation.

Verification fatigue - 10th function, you stop checking\n\nThe danger: training devs who read code but can't reason about correctness. They catch syntax errors, miss logic bugs.\n\nThe fix isn't better AI - it's better verification tooling. Automated test generation, runtime assertions, formal verification for critical paths. Make verification cheaper than manual review.",

While this could be fully automated, I also plan a step through testing option so I can look at the line/loop/etc as it passes its interior test. The eventual goal will be to have the AI be able to explain the logic of each step in a sidebar when asked.\n\nThere's a lot of issues that will need to be resolved but AIs are good at handling these details apparently.\n\nPeople are using canned IDEs to work with these AI assisted coders, forgetting that the original IDE — Smalltalk itself — evolved as the language/debugger did. There's no reason why an AI assisted coding system shouldn't be self-evolving in the same way.\n\nI mean Dan Ingalls and Alan Kay — who almost literally created the concept of an IDE (at last the one everyone copies) — are still alive for heaven's sake, so why not do something that you can show off to them? Kay's comment about GUIs, OOP, personal computers, printers, etc from 1997 applies to AI programming assistants today, IMHO, and AI in general:\n\n* \"The real romance is out ahead and yet to come. The computer revolution hasn't started yet. Don't be misled by the enormous flow of money into bad defacto standards for unsophisticated buyers using poor adaptations of incomplete ideas.\"\n\n-Alan Kay\n\nAnother relevant Alan Kay quote that also seems to apply:\n\n* \"There is no idea so simple and powerful that you can't get zillions of people to misunderstand it.\"",

Since that moment Windows users became its beta-testers. Microsoft would install new updates to some users and check through telemetry that their PCs still work alright, before deploying these updates to the rest of users.\n\nSo, when your system dies after some new Windows update it's not a mistake - it's a deliberate design decision. And until Microsoft reverts this decision, rebuilds its testing labs and re-hires thousands of its test engineers - Windows will remain in its current half-broken state and no czar will fix it, unless his name is Vlad and he puts a stake right through Satya Nadella's stupid ass.",

              "text": "Productivity boosts is entirely what it’s good at and what it should be used for. It should not be used for making things from scratch. \n\nProgramming, at its fundamental level, is applied mathematics. \n\nLLM’s don’t do math, they can’t calculate the result of an expression. Instead, they use tokens to try and predict what the result of an expression is.\n\nSo when you tell it “5 + 5=?” it’s going to look for the most likely thing that comes after that, which is 10. It’s using probabilistic reasoning for maths. That’s the complete opposite of what maths actually requires, which is symbolic reasoning.\n\nBefore anyone says “how’s that different to what we do” - There’s a vast difference between what we do when calculating maths and what an LLM does. If I add two large numbers like 548 + 293 your brain does use an algorithm (your brain knows to carry the one over for each column).\n\nYou don’t guess the result, no matter what it may seem.\n\nBefore people mention the papers of LLM’s doing trigonometry or similar - The problem with that paper is that the LLM can’t understand the logic of trigonometry.\n\nThey might make the same fundamental steps to solve the problem, but what you’ll find is that it’s the only way to solve the problem. It will always converge on a realistic solution because it’s the only one available.\n\nThat doesn’t imply an understanding of what it is doing. In addition, it isn’t as if it is able to determine what form of logic to use to get to that point straight away. It iterates until it converges on the same solution that a human might have spotted straight away.\n\nIn addition, it only memorises how it got to that solution. It doesn’t memorise the rules that make up the solution or why it needed to do something a certain way. It never learns the reason why it did something.\n\n[There was another paper that found that LLM’s struggled with symbolic mapping with accuracy dropping off of a cliff.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05262)\n\nBefore people say “Erdos problems are being solved with LLM’s” - you’ll find that the Wiki shows that they _all_ drew from previous work. None of them made any new steps, they just applied the methodology used by other people. \n\nIn fact, almost every AI solution to an Erdos problem has eventually been linked back to prior research found in literature reviews. This is why we had [ErdosGate](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/erdosgate) a few months back.\n\nMost claims of entirely autonomous AI solutions were proven false or retracted. You can see on the [official wiki](https://github.com/teorth/erdosproblems/wiki/AI-contributions-to-Erd%C5%91s-problems) that there isn't a single full solution generated by AI outside of the #728 case, which itself is [still under scrutiny.](https://x.com/acerfur/status/2008608672864502236)\n\nThat is exactly why they use Lean to verify the results, and that proves my other point about these LLM’s not being capable of symbolic reasoning.\n\nThe fact that they need to use Lean to verify their proof shows that they can’t do symbolic reasoning themselves. They have to draw on external tools.\n\nEven DeepMind reach into a symbolic engine for their AlphaGeometry model. \n\nThere have been “reasoning” models that are supposed to bridge the gap, by evaluating the results of something before they say it. However, they come with their own problems (like cascading errors or overthinking).\n\nA 95% accuracy in maths is fundamentally incorrect maths. \n\nThis has been the issue with trying to get these AI Vibe coders to understand the limitations of LLM’s for programming. They don’t understand that code is fundamentally applied maths.\n\nThe problem is that it doesn’t matter for a lot of junior or other higher level programming roles because at that point you’re not concerned with the O complexity or whatever else.\n\nAt most, with AI coding tools, we will see junior roles shrink. That’s a problem, I do not deny. However AI coding tools as they currently stand, being primarily LLM based, will never be capable of replacing more experienced developers. They need more than an LLM to do that.\n\nThere’s a vast difference between using AI for productivity and using AI to vibe code an entire app.\n\nThe predominant aspect of LLM’s that increases productivity is the fact that it can do certain things autonomously that would otherwise be tedious or explain concepts that might be difficult to understand. Boilerplate code, test cases, documentation, etc are where it exceeds in.\n\nGitHub CoPilot is perfectly capable of enhancing productivity, my point is that it cannot be a replacement for an experienced software engineer.\n\nThat is why I specifically say that junior developers and developers working at a higher level are the most likely to be affected by it.\n\nYou can see this already with the drop off in frontend only development jobs and the cut down of graduate hiring. However, that doesn’t mean that it’s replacing them. Rather it is enhancing the productivity of the people already there.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I use CoPilot just as well. However, I can catch the issues that LLM’s can cause prior to committing and make the changes I need to in order for it to work.\n\nLLM’s can’t replace experienced software engineers.",

In some ways it's a terrible time to be starting out, but on the other hand, the lessons learned as we sort through this new abstraction layer are going to be valuable.  I think companies will soon realize that they still need to be hiring juniors, and also that ramping them up may be faster/easier than in the past.

He's the director of sales for a small but very profitable business that paid a vibe coder to basically screw them. What this turd built worked...at first. Then it all fell apart, and no one including the original \"developer\", could figure out how to fix it. Why? Because none of them had written a line of code in their lives and didn't have a clue where to start debugging the spaghetti code. It was designed work under a narrow set of parameters and, as soon as things inevitably veered off-path...boom.\n\nMy son told the CEO *\"We need to get my dad to help\"*. Unfortunately. I had a seizure recently and wasn't keen on driving from the sticks into the city. So, the boss ubered my ass from bumfuck and told me I had carte blanche.\n\nSo, yeah, there are legit scenarios where vibe coding is worth it. And it may/will cost some jobs - especially for jr-mid devs. But, I'm thinking there are going to be some real opportunities for actual developers (Srs with experience for sure) to come in and pick up the pieces when the spaghetti inevitably hits the fan.",

It sees the compiler's errors when it messes up which version it's running. If it's wrong about a verison of a library, you can remind it it's a different one, and even straight out point at the documentation or the library's source. It's interactive, listens to reasonable instructions regarding code style, attempts to match the style of your codebase in the first place... it's not just going to vomit hundreds of lines of stack overflow nonsense.\n\nIn the end I end up with a PR that is better than what I'd get from a junior, tests and all. But that's not what you get when the integration is just a fancy autocomplete, or a code reviewer that didn't look at the entire codebase, just at the diff.\n\nThat's where the real AI implementation problem is: A lot of things for sale are kind of shitty, or outright terrible.

To me, the boring part is scaling it and dealing with kubernetes. I know I need to set up a domain, DNS, I need to set up DNS records (A, CNAME, TXT, MX), deal with ports, deal with making it secure from aspect of network communication, set up nginx config, deal with renewing certs with letsencrypt, expose observability -> set up Grafana and dashboards and then deal with ELK etc. This isn't, by any means, interesting in any sort of way or mystic or unachievable. It just requires me to pay attention and perform mechanically. I know how to describe this but I'm not efficient since I'll make a mistake due to my limited human memory and my limited focus (while I wait for one thing to finish, I browse Reddit or do something else that chips away at my focus). I've done this many times, most of us have done similar process that we understand fully but due to many moving parts - it requires mechanical focus rather than creative focus.\n\nAnd at this part, AI is better than me since it can follow my exact directions and it takes less time for me to verify everything is ok than to write it.\n\nIn case of, what can be considered non-trivial, creating apps that rely on encryption - the boring part is making sure I save the keys to a secure location (Hashicorp Vault) and retrieve them in secure manner (or, expected manner). The process of making the encryption do its thing correctly is trivial, but the setup of the whole thing takes time - again, AI is better than I am from pure mechanical POV - sure, it can make mistakes but I'm quicker at verifying it's working the way I imagined it should work.\n\nWe can expand these actions further. From SQL modelling POV - I can come up with the correct model, but writing queries (which I can also do) takes more time for me to complete than it does for AI, if it follows exact instructions (I'm not talking about simple queries here but about models that depend on triggers for certain actions related to materializing data or asserting validity).",

I believe the coder/developer should \\*\\*review\\*\\* and \\*\\*understand\\*\\* every line of code that is added or altered by AI tools.\n\n>During development, I use AI tools to help with debugging, research, exploring ideas, and occasionally, generating some boilerplate code or just adding some comments. I am aware that the latter is controversial. However, I am ok with it for two reasons: one, better to have AI comments than no comments at all, and two, I believe it provides embedded context (memory) that helps AI models remember more details about the code which helps generate better code suggestions, design recommendations, and code analysis later on.\n\n>One obvious example of where I made use of AI is in the \\`docs/\\`, \\`explanations/\\`, and \\`future-feature-specs/\\` folders. Thes files in these folders were generated in the moment when I could not take time away from what I was doing to code a full spec or doc but I also didnt want to forget about it or lose my thoughts on the matter.\n\n>Another example you can find in the code base is in the Vite config where I had an AI model generate the repetitive if statements that split the Rollup output files into separate chunks based on module names.\n\n>That being said, I am not a fan of extensive use of AI models in Agent mode as this can lead to code corruption, loss of previous work, bloat, and other issues down the line. I believe AI should be used as an imperfect assisting tool that should always be supervised and reviewed by the human developer and never given the reigns. Simply put, you need a healthy bit of skepticism regarding anything AI says or does.\n\nIm not sure it was wise to do so, but the first release wont be ready for a while soo... its whatever.",

There are a few cares where AI does great, I'm implementing tests on a bunch of sub classes that all inherit the same base class and do something remarkably similar, sure AI can hang out those tests given a few examples to copy from, and often that can work with minimal feedback. Otherwise it falls apart rapidly.\n\nTrying to describe and have it implement a feature often requires me to continuously ask it to make changes, often in round about ways, often to a level of verbosity that is rage inducing. I think I'm really good at reading code, Primagen mentions that as something he's not super strong at, but even then I think reading LLM code, understanding it, and then figuring out what needs to change to make it work is just fundamentally a longer process than an experienced software engineer writing the code to begin with. I think that's why \"agentic\" is a thing, but that's also currently just a pipe dream of AI marketing teams. I have not seen agentic AI successful used anywhere so far, and the few that claim to usually have something like gain from making that claim, also their product usually feels like vaporware.\n\nI still use AI and I think it's still a valuable tool, the thing is it's about 1/10th as useful as they've made it out to be, and I'm being extraordinarily generous here. I use AI auto complete sometimes, because yeah hitting tab is faster than typing out a simple for loop, but it's actually pretty seldom that I find a task that an LLM can generate code for that actually saves me time.\n\nMy wife is an attorney, she uses LLMs for some authoring work, but she's still driving. We both kinda agree with the concept of it just kinda being auto complete on steroids, and frankly I don't see current LLM technology ever becoming much more than that. Maybe some other models will find ways to make more comprehensive AI systems, but frankly I think LLMs are one of the less interesting spaces for AI research, they just have the best optics for a general audience.",

The pattern usually goes like this:\n\n1. Decide to try letting an LLM do some coding work for me.\n2. Run an initial prompt, get results that look like they're 80% there, within seconds (OMG, that's awesome!)\n3. Start refining the prompt to get from 80% to 100%. First round of refinement improves some things, but also introduces a few new niggles.\n4. Keep refining the prompt; with every iteration, the prompt gets larger and more complicated, and the cost/benefit ratio of those refinements gets worse and worse.\n5. Eventually, around the 90% mark maybe, that cost/benefit ratio falls off a cliff - every further improvement I try to get out of the LLM breaks something else, often in horrible ways (down to outright ignoring my very explicit instructions, writing code that doesn't even parse, or producing output that is very clearly wrong in ways that would be hilarious if it weren't so sad).\n6. After an hour or so of tinkering, throw everything away, and write the solution myself in 10 minutes.\n\nThen again, I have a ton of experience, and I rarely struggle with the things beginners tend to run into. Figuring out how to solve a problem isn't usually holding me back (though understanding the problem in the first place may take some time), and entering the code into a computer isn't the bottleneck either, so there's not really all that much an LLM could help me with - if I need to write code that is so predictable that an LLM can do it, then I'll usually scratch myself behind the ears and wonder where I missed an abstraction opportunity, and worst case, I'll break out a bit of metaprogramming or code generation to bring down the amount of hand-written code I need to solve the problem. This way, at least I know that the result I'll get from the automation are deterministic and that I can formally reason about them.\n\nThere is one use case I have found for the technology though: sometimes, I look for a specific thing, and I can describe the thing, but I can't remember its name, so I throw the description into an LLM, and it'll usually spit out some search terms that lead me to the information I need. They also spit out a bunch of wrong results usually, but that's OK, I can filter the results from here, I just need a bunch of candidate search terms.",

                  "text": "OK, here comes the lengthy explanation.\n\n\"Work\", here, means \"we have high confidence that the code we produce is correct, and we have evidence to back that confidence up\".\n\nThere are two ways to obtain evidence for code correctness, and both are problematic: automated tests, and static analysis.\n\nAutomated tests are problematic because every nontrivial program has a state space large enough to require many universes to achieve 100% coverage. In other words, as long as our tests just probe random inputs and check that the outputs are correct, we can never cover more than a miniscule fraction of the possible situations that can arise, and our chances of accidentally hitting a problem case are close to zero.\n\nStatic analysis is problematic because every nontrivial program is going to be so complex that reliably doing all that reasoning in your head without making any mistakes is practically impossible; automated proofs however are still in their infancy. You also still need a human to translate requirements into proof goals, and that step alone provides ample room for errors.\n\nThe way we solve this conundrum is to combine the two methods, in a very specific way: we use an incomplete, informal, manual, ad-hoc, static analysis to form a mental model of the code and its constraints (i.e., we look at the source code and understand how it works), use automated proof tooling (such as type checkers) to verify some (but not all) of the constraints we have inferred, and then use our understanding of the code to come up with automated tests that are designed to be maximally unlikely to pass if our understanding turns out to be wrong.\n\nFor example, our informal reasoning could result in the conclusion that a division is happening in the code, we think that division by zero is properly handled, and it is obvious that *if* division by zero is to happen, it will be when arguments a and b are equal. Our type system doesn't allow us to define this property (a must not equal b) as a constraint, nor does it give use the option to statically enforce that a function can never throw a division-by-zero exception, so we write an automated test that passes the same value for both arguments, and verifies that no division-by-zero error occurs. Among the gazillion possible inputs, we're only sampling a small handful, but that small handful has been carefully selected to probe exactly those cases that, according to our incomplete static analysis, are likley to be edge cases.\n\nA slightly more metaphorical example would be a dice that's supposed to always roll a 6. We can test this dice by rolling it a number of times and verifying that every result is indeed a 6 - but that only says something about the finite number of rolls we made. If we rolled the dice 1000 times, and got a 6 every time, then all that tells us that it's possible for the dice to produce a 6 1000 times in a row - but a dice that rolls a 1 every once in a million rolls would still pass the test. We can, however, inspect the dice (\"static analysis\"), without actually rolling it, and gain an understanding of its design. For example, the dice may have 6es on all six sides; this will make it obvious that it can in fact not produce any other result, and a single roll that does indeed produce a 6 is enough to back that analysis up with experimental data. Or we might conclude that the dice has been weighted towards the side opposite 6, and the corners are rounded such that it will always land showing 6 as long as there's sufficient momentum to the roll. So we run some tests, rolling the dice with significantly less momentum than one normally would, demonstrating that it still produces 6 in 100 out of 100 rolls. This won't give us 100% certainty, but the degree of confidence we get is much higher than in the initial blind test, because we have used our understanding of the mechanism behind it to design a test to specifically provoke the undesired behavior (rolling something other than 6), and found that even under those extra-strict conditions, the dice holds up. And we can also use our insights from this procedure to inform the way we analyze and tests other parts of the system that depend on those dice rolls - e.g., if we want to build a dice roll machine to roll this dice, we can take the minimum momentum needed to make it produce a 6 consistently, and design our dice roller to use a significantly higher momentum than that.\n\nThis is how software engineers have been doing things for decades, and if done properly, it works extremely well.\n\nBut \"vibe coding\" means there is no static analysis, because you're not looking at the code, ever. All you get are undirected automated tests, and, worse, chances are most of them were generated by the LLM along with the code, and you're not looking at those either, which means they are essentially worthless. For all you know, the LLM could have generated a million automated tests that all read `if (true) then pass();` If you hand-write the tests to actually match the specifications, you can at least avoid the latter problem, but you're still fighting astronomical odds.",

One was in October 2025 and the other now in Jan 2026. Both still up and running. No runtime errors, no db issues-just solids apps. I have everything down from auth to DTO wiring with secure end points on HTTPS. Code was revised by a senior Developer that does our company IT and could not even pick up I was vibe coding the whole way. Like everything from start to end is vibe coded.\n\nI discuss, plan and map out my ideas on GPT and then ask for repo aware instructions from GPT to give to Codex in a CLI. I then save the instructions in a .txt file in the repo and tell codex to get to work. When codex is done its saves a summary and a diff view I then give back to GPT. When the project nears publication I let codex scan and make a dense summary of the code, logic and schemas used. I take this summary and then start a refactoring process which i screen against JPL's 10 coding rules and start the refactoring process. Once that's done I have codex write unit tests and test the heck out of everything, give to the IT for revision and publication-aaand Bob's your uncle, a working app with full on user management, hashed passwords, secure db's and data flow.        \n\nI really wish I had the time and money to actually learn full on coding. And I feel an apology is needed to all of you that have studied your asses off and paid a ton of money and actually know how to code. \n\nVibe coding has opened so many doors and possibilities for me... Even won certificates at work for my work. \n\nAm I being a charlatan here? I do feel guilty sometimes but I do also put in a ton work planning, prompting and testing everything.

An app with poor quality code will be slow, unmaintainable and have security issues. If you want to realize your ideas I think these ideas have to be executed the best way possible. Let's say my idea is to make a platformer game: between one with poor performance, bugs and unmantainable code and one that can be played without problems and is easily extensible, I would choose the latter for sure. It's an espectrum obviously, but the better the quality of your code the more you can approximate the ideal.",

Hell, they have more code to debug if anything. The only difference is they now have someone to talk to rather than constantly bothering the seniors for every trivial question.\n\nThis whole idea that AI is somehow generating bad code, and then we as professionals just get to shrug and go \"Well, the AI did it\" is sort of absurd. What sort of workplace do you work in where \"AI did it\" is a valid excuse? Do you just commit a bunch of gibberish and then never ship anything?\n\nOk. The AI did it. But it's not working. So you go fuckin fix it til it's working, eh? If you don't know how... Well... This is where building the intuition and doing painful debugging comes in.\n\nEssentially, all I'm getting from these posts is y'all are working in really, really bad teams if this is how your juniors act.\n\nEdit: Note the only rebuttal was from someone that read what I wrote, hammered out a reply suggesting that someone who's been posting consistently about  leading a team of programmers for well over a decade has \"never been in an actual job,\" and then hit the block button. This is a clear example of someone that's part of a bad team, and likely doesn't even realise it. Just your stereotypical \"I am a *programmer*, how **dare** you disrespect me\" behaviour. I disrespect you because I've been in this field for decades now, and I have a pretty good sense for when you deserve respect.\n\nIf you're a programmer and your find that you relate to the things that the hard anti-AI crowd is writing, then take a look around you and think about what you're actually doing, and what you want to be dong. If you spend more of your time tweaking pointless things, and you think that the complexity of programming is down to the specific lines of code you've written... Well, I hope you're still a junior that just hasn't encountered actual complexity yet, cause otherwise you won't be in this profession for much longer.",

Documentation goes out of date, people's memories of lessons they learn can shift over time. People make mistakes, miss things, or lack knowledge of important patterns.\n\nIf reviews are being skipped it's a problem, but it always has been. You could call some library that does the magic thing, but have no idea how it works, and then when it breaks you have to hope someone else has seen it break the same way and written about it online, or debug it yourself.\n\nThe behavior still matters even with this new tool.",

Kotlin and Android development were both new to me. \n\nIt did a great job of mocking up an (almost compiling) implementation of an nfs4j VFS for Android, and also helped shim some Java classes that nfs4j needs that the Android Java SDK doesn't have (and I didn't even know that was possible!).\n\nIn doing that it probably saved me a few hours of research, however things quickly soured once I ran into issues, as it would just straight up lie to me, either about the source of the problem, or by suggesting APIs that didn't exist. If I corrected it, it apologised and then offered me the same wrong thing again. \n\nAs many hours as it initially saved, it later wasted by sending me down the wrong rabbit hole. It ultimately turned out my real issue was that nfs4j has an internal limit to its inode opaque data, and if you go past that then things go _really_ weird. Gemini couldn't figure that out as it's not documented or enforced anywhere in the code. \n\nWhile I'm not sure it saved me time overall, what it did give me was the initial confidence to dive into Kotlin and get familiar with it. I have since replaced almost all the code it generated, as I need to know what it does if I'm to \"own\" it.",

                  "text": "> Let's say you are executing code at $400, and you need to call a routine in the other bank. Your next instruction might be an STA $0FFE, to strobe the bank switch line, which would immediately switch banks, so now all the code in the address space (except the 128 bytes of zero page RAM) is switched with the code and data in bank 2, but, your PC is now at $203\n\nWhy would my PC change in that way? [edit: to be clear I was indicating it very much does not. The poster mis-explained this. You look at code which is in ROM at another address, but your PC did not change to that other address. You bank switched your code into the address near the PC. If you put a bus analyzer on and watch, you will see your PC does not change in the way the post indicates.]\n\nWhat you are calling code interleaving is really pretty standard code overlays. Overlays are usually loaded from storage into memory, in this case the are XIP (execute in place), but when compling/assembling you do it the same way. You ORG two pieces of code to the same location and then do a switch out at runtime to run the one that is in the other overlay.\n\nIf you really want to be tricky you can make special \"cross-overlay\" calls where instead of putting the real PC on the stack as your return address you put on the address of a little thunk that switches the bank back and then jumps on into the overlay. That way when you return from the call the overlay is switched back automatically, where if that did not happen you would end up returning to another piece of code that happened to be at the same address in the overlay that had been switched to.\n\nNote that this kind of trickery was more useful on 16-bit machines because on 8-bit machines like the 6502 the stack was only 256 bytes in size. You couldn't put a lot of extra data on the stack without overflowing it. This is a big reason 8-bit machines were rarely targeted by high-level languages (including C/Pascal). You just didn't have the stack space for a lot of nested function calls with local variables.\n\nFor example, on the Apple ][ Pascal was UCSD Pascal which ran on the UCSD P-system which was a virtual machine. The virtual machine was 16-bit. Woz wrote also his own virtual 16-bit system on Apple ][ called \"SWEET16\".",

I guess some guy wanted to block me, so now I can't even respond to my own posts.\n\nHere's my reply to the guy so confident in what he said that he had to block me:\n\n> Two or more banks of code are quite literally interleaved with each other. \n> It is two separate lines of code in parallel.\n\nThey're not interleaved. They are in separate banks. Nothing about writing overlays or similar indicates you must make a function call to switch. You can bank switch and continue in another bank, in fact it's what you always do. when writing in high-level language it's difficult to arrange your functions to \"fall\" into each other. With assembly it's easier because you use ORG a lot anyway. And due to the reasons I mentioned, you don't want to make a lot of function calls on a 6502. You just don't have the stack for it.\n\nNothing runs in parallel. The code is not parallel or interleaved. There is only one processor. It just means if you want to see the code being executed you have to look in a different, non-consecutive pieces of source code. The processor is just running one instruction at a time with what it sees as sequential code. And it is sequential in fetch order. It's just not sequential in your source code.\n\nThis operates like overlays, just in this case instead of moving the code into place, you reprogram the hardware (bank switch). So the code runs in a hardware mirrored (address aliasing due to the address decoding logic) location. You write the code with the same build tools you use for overlays. You just run them a little differently because you have special hardware.\n\nIt's a good system, not saying otherwise.\n\n> Please don't try to teach grandpa how to suck eggs.\n\nI see no reason for anyone on here to tell someone else what not to discuss.",

If the reader doesn't know that \"ldx\" loads something and can't deduce that \"ldx currentHealth\" loads the current health, at some point you probably ought to say, \"This source code might be too advanced for you,\" and stop trying to hold their hand as you drag them through an entire marathon.",

No frameworks, no abstractions - just raw logic. You can trace every input to every output.\n\n3. **Hardware timing tricks**: Atari 2600 had no framebuffer. The CPU had to race the electron beam, writing pixels as the TV scanned. Comments here probably reveal techniques lost to institutional knowledge.\n\n4. **Educational value**: Want to understand how computers actually work? Start here, not with React. You'll see memory mapping, stack management, interrupt handling - fundamentals buried under 50 years of abstraction layers.\n\nThe \"embarrassing amount of time\" spent here is time well spent.

This opens doors for medical devices, industrial control, aerospace.\n\n2. **SDL3 in Dart**: This is the real unlock. SDL3 gives you low-level access (input, audio, windowing) without C++ interop overhead. Dart becomes a viable systems language for realtime applications.\n\n3. **Filament renderer**: Google's physically-based renderer, same quality as Unreal/Unity, but designed for mobile-first constraints. Console-grade visuals on embedded hardware isn't marketing - it's tested in RAV4 2026.\n\n4. **Why not Godot**: Startup time matters in cars. User presses button, dashboard must respond instantly. Godot's scene tree initialization is too slow for automotive UX requirements.\n\nThe killer feature: hot reload in production.

And you can try to safeguard against it with unit tests and such, but ultimately you can only be confident about things by reading the code yourself.\n\n\nI don't see a future where this changes. You generally don't need to look at assembly because outside (nowadays very uncommon) compiler bugs or assembly-level optimizations, it is a 1-to-1 abstraction between high-level code and assembly. As long as your high-level program is valid, the resulting assembly should be valid. And that's just not how LLMs work, fundamentally. There's no way to tell if a prompt is valid or not because there's no such thing as an invalid prompt, and even the most thorough and complete prompt still relies on the LLM's statistical output doing what you hope it would.",

In my case, the anti-good-code pressure is coming from both sides.\n\nIn open source, I have started getting vibe-code contributions, which are tedious to review due to their cacophonic nature. I'm very lucky that my projects aren't that massive (between fifty and a hundred stars for the biggest few), since I can imagine the added burden of people trying to rewrite my code with AI slop generators would have an overwhelming impact on my precious spare time if my projects were any bigger. The other day, I had a person ask to be made the primary maintainer of some software that I had put into maintenance mode, despite the fact that their (singular) pull request was entirely vibe coded with very poor documentation, files committed that should have been gitignored, and the gitignore deleted.\n\nIn teaching, there has been an enormous amount of pressure to \"integrate AI into our teaching strategies and learning outcomes\", despite the preponderance of evidence indicating that AI use negatively impacts students' ability to learn. For the sections I'm in charge of, I've been able to stem the flood of slop, but for some classes I have to instruct my students to use these tools in ways that I know are bad for their learning. Essentially, in some courses I teach, higher-ups are trying to force us to focus less on teaching how to write good code, and instead focus on teaching them how to deliver MVPs as quickly as possible.\n\nLast term, there was one assignment where 50% of the submissions I marked had tell-tale signs of AI use, despite AI use being disallowed for that assignment. Depressingly, most students were using AI to generate their design rationales, which were the most important part of the assignment in terms of learning. Spending hours of my life assessing work that was generated by a computer, knowing that my hard work teaching and giving feedback was all going to waste on students who had replaced their brain with a large language model was incredibly depressing. Don't even get me started on the students who used AI to generate emails to debate their marks, wasting hours of my time writing responses that they fed directly into ChatGPT to send another reply demanding I fix their \"incorrect\" or \"unfair\" marks.\n\nI understand that some of my grievances aren't strictly to do with good code, but all the little pieces add up into the slop-filled hellscape I find myself in.",

          "text": "Good code requires time. Time is money. Therefore “good enough” to move the revenue line upward is what you get paid to do, almost always, as a professional.\n\nYou can write good code quickly, but it requires simplicity; employing the least amount of engineering possible, to achieve the result you need. \n\nTherefore good code requires a good developer, with the experience to know how to get there, and the maturity to set ego aside and avoid the impulse to overthink, and over-engineer, the solution. \n\nIt also requires a fair amount of creativity, to bring all of this together. Problem solving requires a creative streak to think outside the box and form ideas that haven’t been tried yet. This sometimes means using tools in ways they’re not entirely intended. \n\nThe best geeks I’ve ever known were creative people. \n\nModels and agents have been engineered to appear to do these things, but they neither think or create. They give you average results based on even the best inputs. \n\nWhat then becomes of the foundation we’ve built from scratch, using human ingenuity and organic creativity? Will these models not eventually collapse, as they rely upon human creativity for all of the data they’ve burn trained on? Once the inputs are all the same dirty dishwater that’s going out, where does all the novelty come from to move forward again?\n\nWhat happens to all the creative geniuses that would have passed through the fire, agonizing over hire to solve a complex code problem and developing their minds, to become those competent seniors we need, to keep this profession moving forward?\n\nSeems to me, they’re learning nothing - only how to keep feeding slop back into the slop machine until the slop finally works. Passive button-pushers, writing miles of boring, dry prompts all day and cranking out dirty dishwater. \n\nIt’s depressing to me. Downright dystopian. The people pushing this and the people on the ground swooning over it are likely much the same, IMO. Passionless about good code and engineering in general, thinking only about the next buck that can be gamed out of the market.",

There was a significant amount of time and money put into testing the feasibility of an approach and this is what we are seeing the major change in.\n\n\n\nIt would takes months or even years to develop an MVP with a limited feature set, now it takes days. Of course, with anything that abstracts away effort it will welcome many without foundational skills (vibecoders) - but this isn’t new. Prior to LLMs we had bootcamps, churning out thousands of people who could assemble a to-do app or whatever. Prior to bootcamps we had things like WIX, or some other drag-and-drop website creator, the list goes on but the point is clear.\n\n\n\nThe process from MVP onward has not changed. If you have a solution that provides users an engaging experience for whatever it is they need, at this point good code starts to make an appearance - or it should if management and/or founder understand how to prioritize what matters.\n\n\n\nGood code will never die, it will simply be harder to find. All the noise generated by thousands of Claude instances running with “Accept and auto approve edits” will be hard to navigate, sure - but we should all be familiar with new solutions bringing new problems. \n\n\n\nMy dudes, I am sorry that we’re the ones to experience this shift at its most jarring, it’s a pain in the ass to try and keep up, but we’ve seen plenty of code that’s made us cringe over the years - the only difference is there is more of it out there than ever before.",

Postman became dominant because it solved one problem exceptionally well. Each new feature (workspaces, monitoring, documentation) increases surface area for bugs and complexity, while potentially confusing new users about what the product actually does.\n\nThe counterargument: APIs are inherently a full lifecycle problem. If you're testing an API, you probably also need to document it, monitor it, mock it for development. The question is whether one tool should own that entire stack or whether best-of-breed specialized tools win.\n\nSo far, vertical integration has worked better for developer tools than \"super apps\" - but Postman's market position is strong enough they might be the exception.",

At my current company, there's a Docker Build step that produces the binary (or bundle), then runs unit tests and linter against this prepared code. Then there's a SAST scan that takes 20-30 minutes. Then it gets deployed to 5 separate environments in serial, each one with its own set of IaC deployments and integration test runs. Also, each *type* of deployment is deployed in serial per environment, such as an infrastructure deploy, a micro service deploy, a static content deploy, an observability deploy, etc.\n\nAnd, if the deployment failed at any step along the way, the whole process must be kicked off again, after someone creates a new merge request, even if the failure requires no code change to fix (environment problems outside the deployment). I have literally had to make a merge request that was completely empty just so the CI/CD process would create a new build artifact for the deployment.\n\nAs if that wasn't already bad enough, we have manual push-button deployment stages between 3 of the 5 environments. If the build sits idle for more than X days, the approval to deploy expires and you need to kick off another new build.",

If you have lots of tests that never fail, they're probably not good tests (although I disagree with the advice that you should just delete tests that haven't failed for a long time: see also, *Chesterton's Fence*).\n\nHonestly I don't think I've ever been in an environment where integration test failures were seen as a problem, unless it's an avoidable issue arising because developers are skipping local unit testing out of laziness or lack of ownership - so this feels like a bit of a strawman article. Though it does make a good point about the value of tests, broadly.\n\nWhat people do get annoyed by is slow integration pipelines, especially if it causes PR branches to get queued up behind each other, and having tests constantly re-running (and taking ages *again*) because someone else's change got merged before yours did, forcing a restart. That's a whole different problem though. One that you're more likely to actually face in the real world outside the smallest of startups, and which doesn't have any easy solution other than making compromises somewhere, one possibility being much more costly infrastructure and massively parallelisable tests, but that's usually off the table.\n\nThe \"Too much CI\" section feels like it was written by AI, because it doesn't actually describe a \"too much CI\" situation, which is what I described above. I.e., when it becomes a barrier to deploying because it's too slow for the number of teams trying to release features in parallel. At that point just deleting some tests might make sense, but that should be done carefully, or else look at batching up low priority tests into overnight runs. That way some preventable regressions might slip into production, but at least worst case you catch them the next day before they have time to do too much damage. And hopefully anything high-value is covered by your core test suite anyway.",

If you're bypassing your automated processes all the time, you need to look at fixing your automation, or your architecture (e.g., have smaller deployables with simpler integration tests). Don't rely on human judgement and assumptions about what the blast radius of each change is. The whole point of regression tests is people very often get that wrong.\n\nIf you're talking about the same thing I said, which is to split your tests into core suite and a slow (overnight) suite then that's fine in that it takes the possibility of human error out of the equation. But at the same time everyone has to accept the risk of occasional production regressions, on the basis that if those tests were high-value things to really worry about, they'd have been in the core suite already.",

When the time between an action and a consequence get too far apart, the perpetrator begins to have trouble fully internalizing their culpability. It doesn't provide as much motive to change their actions as it does if they get feedback within a day or so of their action. Because they've moved on to other things and this action represents something from their past.\n\nIf you tell someone they hurt your feelings a year ago, you might get sympathy but not a lot of new behavior. If you tell them they hurt your feelings ten minutes ago, you're likely to see more of a course correction.

Pros: the code will actually work. Cons: you will spend time (and thus money) on an issue that nobody else knew existed, and that's hard to explain; you will delay other work (and at least some of the people you're delaying will hate you for it); you may not meet your productivity quota because you're not \"shipping features\".\n\n**Option B:** sweep the problem under the rug. Pro: nobody will notice, it's been like this forever, and if anyone else finds out later, they'll probably do the same, so you probably won't be blamed for it - and if you are, you can always mumble something about changing winning teams. Con: the code will remain broken, accumulate more technical debt as you add kludges to work around the problem, and possibly break in production.\n\nFrom an organization's perspective, you want option A, even though it's painful - but the way large organizations work, people will pick option B, because it's the least likely to lead to career suicide.",

Or rather, I hate when apps choose to always open in nonsensical places, neither centered nor where they were last open.\n\n> Some popups, such as Search Everywhere and Recent Locations, may not be moved outside of the main frame.\n\nThat's not a Wayland thing. For whatever reason, they just decided that popups must be contained inside the window. Probably so that they can have more control over where things pop up?\n\n> Window decorations (such as the title bar, window control buttons, shadows, and rounded corners), where present, may not fully adhere to the current desktop theme\n\nYeah that one is harder to defend. Titlebar and window rounding, I don't really care. But inconsistent shadows, or complete lack of shadow makes the window feel \"off\".",

Most desktop environments will allow windows to supply their own decorations if they wish but will provide a default implementation on the server side as an alternative. GNOME, in their infinite wisdom, have decided that all clients must provide their own decorations, and if a client does not, they will simply be missing. I disagree with this decision; Factorio does not need to provide decorations on any other platform, nay, on any other desktop environment, but GNOME can (ab)use its popularity to force programs to conform to its idiosyncrasies or be left behind.\n> \n> To fix this, I had to bring in another dependency, libdecor. It functions, and SDL even has support for it, but a video game shouldn't have to supply window decorations in the first place.",

Obviously the retort would be that I need to be more specific, and that is the whole problem. At some point you will be so specific, that when removing the unneeded verboseness of natural language, you have created a programming language. Then somebody comes along who spend a lot of time to crafting good \"prompts\" resulting in specific functionality... and you've created a library or framework. The main contribution of of LLMs in this case would be the black bock which produces nondeterministic results (and all bets are off in the next release).",

And even at temperature 0 you get implementation-dependent floating point accumulation differences. There's no spec to fix because the variance IS the mechanism. You can't write a sanitizer for \"the model hallucinated a slightly different function signature this time.\"\n\n  \nSo to answer your question directly - what breaks from the historical analogy is the verification story. When FORTRAN replaced assembly, you could still prove your program was correct. The abstraction preserved the ability to reason about behavior. LLMs don't preserve that.

If the same Fortran, compiled on the same compiler and run on the same operating system and hardware produced different observable results, _that_ would be nondeterminism. \n\nBy contrast, I'm not sure that if I plug the same prompt into the same LLM, it will generate the same code twice in a row. Heck, I'm not even sure if the behavior of the code would be the same. Forget different compilers and different hardware. Even if I control all factors I can control, LLMs don't seem to be predictable.\n\n---\n\nThe argument that I make is that, with essentially no exceptions, there are no current programming languages that try to infer programmer intent (we can argue over whether something like ASI in JavaScript is an example of \"inferring intent\", but it's completely specified and predictable). There may be a lot of behavior that is hidden from view, whether behind libraries or buried in the semantics of the language itself. But the behavior of the program is directed by the intent expressed in the code, and any deviation from that is a bug in the programming language implementation that _should_ be fixed. That has been true from machine code through every language in use today.\n\nThat is _not_ what you get with LLMs. An LLM will work _really hard_ to fill in the gaps of the intent that you express. Sometimes it guesses correctly, sometimes incorrectly. Sometimes it's clear where it has guessed and sometimes it's subtle. Sometimes it's catastrophic, like when it wipes your source repo. It's even arguable that \"inferring your intent\" is an anthropomorphism of an entirely mechanical process.\n\nThat indicates to me that the activity that you perform when you engage an LLM is a fundamentally different activity than when you engage a programming language.",

For example asking to pay for a tool like JetBrains or taking the time to write your own framework would meet with resistance. \n\nYet now it is businesspeople, apparently out of solidarity with Sam Altman, who have started force-feeding engineers this supposed efficiency improvement. Which, needless to say, *relies* on all the previous work done by engineers to allow it to provide answers. If you didn’t have compilers, template engines, reactive frameworks, and other infrastructure, the answers LLMs would have to provide would be much more complex and error-prone.\n\nBut an LLM will never suggest writing a framework to address a need. So if we only ever use LLMs to program, we will be stuck at the level that software development achieved in the mid-2010s.\n\nAs others have pointed out, an LLM is nothing like these earlier tools because it is not deterministic. For example JetBrains has a feature to add Equals and GetHashcode to any class. This is done through syntactic transformation of the parse tree and is guaranteed to work for any class. Asking an LLM to do the same thing might give you the same result but there is no guarantee and it’s also much less efficient.\n\nThis brings me to the second observation: the FORTRAN project is justified in the post as being about saving CPU time, or using CPU time more efficiently. LLMs if anything are the opposite, an enormous *waste* of CPU time to provide simple answers that could be gotten without it, with hundreds of billions of dollars being spent just to create the needed computing capacity for this project. \n\nIf a programmer asked for a trillion dollar server farm that would process his natural language search queries and spit out code just so he didn’t have to think, he would be laughed at. \n\nNow he’s being forced to swallow the requirement that he *must* use natural language search queries to do his coding in order to justify the existence of the trillion dollar server farm, which will end up being a very poor business decision without a captive user base.",

Regular product enhancements and security patches will only be applied to the new version of LocalStack for AWS available via our website.\n\nThat's a lot of words to say \"we're abandoning Community edition\".",

              "text": "Having studied psychology before eventually pivoting into programming, one of the recurring themes in psych is that humans have a lot of biases/heuristics that cause them to be extremely bad at assessing their own performance and abilities. The Dunning-Kruger effect is a common one that you'll see mentioned on Reddit, but there are plenty of others.\n\nThe other problem is that, frankly, you can't fucking trust the comments you see on social media. Setting aside the fact that half of these comments might just be bots, there's the simple fact that most people are talking about completely different use cases, types of projects, types of work, AI models, coding standards, etc. As others have pointed out in this thread, people whose project(s) require them to write new code from scratch for problems that have been solved a million times over are probably going to report way more satisfaction than people like me, who spend most of their time maintaining an older(er) codebase full of shit code written by people who are long gone, whose requirements came from people who have also moved on, and which didn't make much sense to begin with. \n\nTo use a different example, I remember a series of comments I saw over on the Steam Deck sub. Essentially, one user was saying [game] (I don't specifically remember which it was, but let's pretend it was Remnant II) \"runs great\" on the Deck. I (and the guy who replied to this comment) did a double-take, because Remnant II ran like absolute ass on the lowest settings with DLSS set to ultra performance. We're talking maybe 15 FPS with everything looking blurry from DLSS. Well, it turns out that \"runs great\" = \"it doesn't crash to desktop\" according to the follow-up post. \n\nPoint is, people all have different standards for greatness, and we generally lack the self-awareness to recognize our own abilities, or how long it takes us to perform certain tasks. Like I'd be willing to bet that, if you accurately measured the time it takes for most AI evangelists to complete their tasks with and without AI (nevermind the quality of the work), I'd bet that AI doesn't really save them all that much time, if any at all.",

Some people will be working on projects that are more accessible to AI generated code.  There is a large variety in the tools and approaches people are using.  People will have different standards on how they evaluate the result and process.  \n\nLots of experiences we read - both positive and negative - are based on very shallow experimentation.  Right now, it is easier for a small publication to get attention with a negative take, because that is what a lot of people want to hear, and that is what a lot of people with a stake in 'the industry as it exists' want to write.\n\nI'd rather AI doesn't shake things up too much.  I like the process of step-by-step, line-by-line programming that I've been doing for 30 years.  I'm good at it, and it has made me valuable as an employee.  But I think most programmers who intend to remain in industry should be experimenting with AI periodically - keeping up to date on progress through personal experience.\n\nThe dominant Reddit position is \"extremely negative\" overall - probably at least somewhat unfairly.  Some of the negative perception is based on experience and good information, but there's also a lot of negative outlook based on reductive/shallow understanding and \"hopeful thinking\".  The level of discourse on AI here has dropped dramatically over time, with actual experts in the field being pushed out of discussion by simpler, louder takes that people like more.",

This program is a service that hosts various integration or other processing jobs that run on a schedule. It's not huge, but it's not tiny. All of it has been coded by me, with a decent chunk being code generated (It's .NET, and I have to integrate with a few WCF services, so the API clients get generated. I also generated entity models for EF Core because of how our database was done.) \n\nAI works for me for small refactors or specific iterative changes in this project because not all of the code needs to be considered and each thing is generally it's own small component that can be worked on - any individual job being scheduled is it's own small subset of the whole that can be looked at mostly in isolation. Would I use it on the ~500K line of code legacy C++ code base for an old MMO I work on as a hobby project? Outside of having it help me gain an understanding of specific pieces of code that may be particularly convoluted, no not really. It can't pull in enough context to do it well because of how spread out and convoluted the code base is.\n\nA lot of people like to shit on AI code, and I get it - there are a ton of vibe coders on twitter and even here on reddit making total asses of themselves.

Try to work on a graphics problem with it, or even a logging issues, and it'll do things that are .... awful.  It'll try to delete log messages because you want to stop seeing those messages. It'll create whole new messages, just to get output it wants even though that's not the right way to handle issues, it'll rewrite tests just to pass, even though the tests are correct. \n\nI call it a junior programmer because that's the mentality, it knows just enough to be dangerous so you need a senior (or another junior) to watch over it and make sure it's doing the right things and not over extending itself.   It parrots what you say back to it, which is great if you know you're right, but if you say \"It's not a font table\" It keeps trying to find the font table, even if that's not what you want. \n\nOr maybe it'll try to rewrite an entire function/components/system because it can't just use it, and doesn't understand how to include new source so it'll copy and paste... ugh. \n\nHere's the conclusion I have had, and it's not ground breaking or anything but it's the truth about it.  AI is just another tool like intellisense, or any type of code generation.   It works, and it doesn't work, it's never 100 percent.  It's like a hammer, if you use a hammer to \"Fix\" a tv, you're going to break it, if you use a hammer to fix a nail, you can still hurt yourself... but sometimes it is the right tool, just one of many you should have. \n\nPeople who hate it only focus on when it fail, people who love it, ignore it when it fail (or don't have the skill to understand when it failed/did something wrong)....   \n\nReally at the end of the day it's a tool, and the person holding that tool matters far more than the tool itself.\n\n(Also what you prompt it with will matter, but it does seem to confuse negative prompts with things to keep looking for, like the font table)",

I write code that has exponentially better secondary characteristics than what I would write manually. My thoughts and reasoning behind specific implementation decisions are automatically added as comments in the code and documented in my prs. Looking through logs is 100000000000x easier than before. If I'm looking at time bound failures and trying to correlate across several distinct metrics I can ask it to show me a line graph of those data points in the log so I can visually compare extremely quickly and move on to the next thing I want to check; just one example.\n\nI have put an extensive amount of effort into learning how to build effective prompts and context implementations. I also do not ask claude to achieve a card level task. I set up a context surrounding the card and its goals and then walk through the task like normal but instead of manually implementing code changes I review the changes Claude makes and move onto the next part of my solution. Some of the people I work with are piping logs from this process downstream to other agents that create summaries of work, monitor higher level stories progress, and even create timesheet data.\n\nI think it's an incredibly useful tool that enables acceleration learning an adoption to new technologies and patterns. Like I said it greatly improves secondary code characteristics, but putting lipstick on a pig doesn't make it a supermodel.\n\nEdit: Something else to be aware of, this stuff is evolving faster than people are trying it. I think a lot of people are going off their experiences in 2025, but this shit is rapidly improving. If you haven't used it in 2026 maybe look up some 2026 stuff on prompt and context engineering and give it another try. Also there seem to be huge gaps in ability between models.

AI-generated code skips that process entirely — you get working code without building the understanding that would let you *evaluate* whether it's actually correct.\n\nThe floor has risen (anyone can ship something that compiles) but the ceiling hasn't moved.

I may even take a bit longer, but writing it the first time is never the real time sucker if it's a serious code base that will live for decades. \n\nHonestly, anything someone could just sit down and do a fully realized spec and design for before starting is probably something I'd consider boring to work on anyway.",

There are definitely cases where the details don’t matter, and a small project can get by without engaging in real domain modeling, but for once a project is complex enough to need a spec I would worry about fully disconnecting the difficulty of the spec from the difficulty of implementing it.",

I live more like a hermit than I ever did in the past. I’m not very social, so I put up with this fairly well, but I still feel it.\n\nAs someone that's probably a bit more extroverted than introverted, this one took quite a bit of adjustment. As mentioned in the article, I'd frequently force myself to get out of the house to see and interact with others, even if it might be totally out of the way. I also started trying to normalize more frequent water-cooler style talks to help build that social connection with others whom I knew also needed it.\n\n\\> your much more invisible to your boss, so you need much better communication.\n\nYes, completely. Over-communication doesn't hurt, especially if you have aspirations about things like being promoted. I've been fortunate to have managers that have always heavily understood this problem in remote work, but I know that's not the case at large.\n\n\\> it is much harder to learn from others, any collaboration is done over zoom and not organic at the cooler.\n\nI think this can be highly team-dependent (and even more so on personalities). Quite a bit depends on the technologies and complexity I'm sure — but you absolutely have to fight a bit to establish/normalize a culture around that type of mentorship and learning, either through impromptu calls, tech talks, pairing, etc.\n\n\\> it is very easy to loose yourself in your work and have no life.\n\nYou really do need a support network around you. Be it friends, family, a partner, etc. Someone that can pick up when you are starting to get pulled in too deeply and reach out to grab you. Ideally, your colleagues can share in this role, much as you should try to do for them.",

Less distraction (esp with Focus mode enabled to further filter crap out).\n- high-quality microphone and webcam (I went a little over-the-top with this...I had done some video content creation a while ago and I have a very nice shotgun mic pointed at me from off-camera, but that's certainly not needed).  I sound and look professional, and that makes a difference in how I'm perceived by my coworkers (and, if not, I'm going to continue to believe it anyway).\n- Indirect, good-but-not-bright light.  Enough that I am properly lit on video calls (with whatever the 'dim light compensation' setting is), but not so bright it's stressful nor so dim I can't see everything on my desk / in the room.  Finding just the right light took me longer than I would have expected.  I _cannot fathom_ how some of my coworkers either sit where there's sunlight glaring into their face or a harsh overhead light being their only light.  Bleh.\n- A KVM between my dock and my personal PC/work PC. This makes it so that I can't \"just jump on my personal machine\" for a second in meetings (which is a distraction); if I switch, my camera and mic drop, my keyboard and mouse swap over....it only takes 5 seconds (so bouncing over _between_ meetings is easy, but I can't easily do it _in_ meetings).\n- Stream Deck, usually loaded with Zoom controls -- easy to jump back to focus, easy to get to screen share, easy to unmute even if I'm not mouse-focused on that window, etc.\n- Good chair -- I like the Aeron.  Used is like 1/5 to 1/4 the cost. Look for \"used business furniture\" places near you.\n- a footrest so I can stretch my legs when needed. I actually use a drum throne/stool, so it can double as a \"guest chair\" for when my partner is in here (like doing some online shopping together or trip planning or whatever) without taking up space unnecessarily when not in use.\n- HEPA filter (ultra-quiet) behind me.  Room always smells and feels fresh.\n\nI'm sure I'm missing other little things or skipping obvious stuff....but basically, _this is where I want to work from_, and I treat the space as such.",

Like, having a meeting with a new vendor?  I have easy ice breakers available to them while waiting for others to join the call.  Or if I'm interviewing -- with the right interviewer, some stuff has really helped the get-to-know-you chat.\n\nThough, I suppose, if you're not the sort that is comfortable vamping with folks on calls, my path might not be _your_ path (since you're inviting questions/conversation)...but I still think decorating the space behind you to \"send a light message\" about who you are helps further solidify the \"this is a comfy place that I want to work\" to your self, and conveys that to folks you interact with via video!",
