All these numbers sound crazy, but you have to remember that all the AI services are heavily subsidized, so you have to 2x or maybe 3x the cost of this \"browser\" built \"fully autonomously\" to see the real cost. So 140~210 million dollars for a repo that doesn't build?",

I asked it to do some stuff, it automatically modified the code and said \"I'm done.\" But when I tried to compiler it, it didn't compile.\n\n\nSo I told it that, and gave it the compiler output, and it figured out the problem and fixed it.\n\n\nSo I thought, if it can figure out the problem given the compiler output, why can't it just try to compile it itself and check the output, and keep going until it can successfully compile and run the program? And given this instruction, it actually did it.\n\n\nNow, you might say \"maybe it can get the program to compile, but is it doing the right thing?\" So let me tell you another anecdote.\n\n\nI gave it a quite simple task of implementing one of our tickets, basically just a counter keeping track of something. But after it had updated the code and added checks of the counter in the tests, I noticed an obvious bug: In some of the tests, the counter ended up negative.\n\n\nSo I told Amazon Q this, and nothing more - there is a bug somewhere, because this counter should never go negative. And Amazon Q responded with \"I understand, the problem is that your requirement said X but what you actually want is Y\".\n\n\nIt basically told me that it hadn't made a mistake, it had followed the requirements correctly but the requirements it had been given didn't match what we actually wanted. And of course it also updated the code to do what I actually wanted.\n\n\nUp until this week, I was extremely skeptical about AI.\n\n\nBut Amazon Q is turning me into a believer.",

The information was encrypted and our job was to find the key by optimizing provided C code that would normally take years to finish, with no further information provided.\n\nReading the code made it immediately clear to me that they were computing the area of a huge circle in the most inefficient way imaginable, so I just replaced that code with the regular circle area formula, computed the result as an approximate floating-point number in a single operation, converted it to an integer, and then interleaved incremental additions and subtractions to brute-force the key until the decrypted result contained something resembling an E-mail address, at which point the exact value was found and the challenge was cleared.\n\nOnce I found the address I just E-mailed them the code and results, which ran so fast on my own computer that just a naive `times` command just returned 0.0 for all system, user, and real time values on Linux. They weren't expecting that solution, said that the fastest version they had internally took 0.3 seconds to run on their systems, and in the end I just told them that I wasn't really interested in the job because it was way too far away from home but found the challenge interesting and definitely uncommon. I never got to read their internal solution so up to this day I haven't figured out exactly what their own train of thought actually was, or even whether they intended the problem to be interpreted as just finding the area of a circle, but that's how I inferred the problem from the provided code and that was the optimal solution that I found.",

Back in the 1980's when I attended university then all you could take into an exam was paper, pen and calculator but only normal calculators that could do basic arithmetic because programmable HP calculators were just appearing and those were banned from the exam room.",

The main thing here seems to be giants bullet point lists of things that went wrong with all these agents interacting with each other it's totally confusing Example:\n\nRuthless triage: If you can't turn a symptom into a task with a measurable outcome quickly, stop and split the work.\n\nOk what on earth does that mean ... It's like a VC writing your documentation.\n\nThere is no actual build at all anywhere that I can download to see if this is actually working. The actions has 63,302 workflow runs which I can't find a single one that has actually ran successfully.\n\nThe git history is complete and utter chaos every day there has been thousands and thousands of git commits for seemingly random stuff all just mixed in with no real proper overarching description. The commit messages don't tell you why but are simply a summary of the diff.\n\nThere are test everywhere. Some of it inline with the code some of it in separate dedicated files. Some of these tests are labelled as test some are not. I think there is an order to this chaos but it's hard to tell as there is no clear docs just giant bullet point lists with VC like speech in them.\n\nThere seems to already be abandoned stuff in this repo for example there are 2 very important structures:\n\nBrowserDocument\nBrowserDocument2\n\nThey seem similar at a high level but seem to be 2 different implementations of the same thing. This is a common pattern to go into a folder and see 2 of the same thing seemingly used for the same thing but with differences. It's like the agent couldn't change one and so just built a different one and changed that instead and left the old one there.\n\nMost of the files are like 500 lines long but there are some mega objects in here that are like 6500 line long files with no structure. The worst one is this:\n\nhttps://github.com/wilsonzlin/fastrender/blob/main/src/resource.rs\n\n30,000 lines in a single file.\n\nSome serious wtf in that file btw have a look through some of those functions my fav is normalize_http_url_for_fetch which seems to be a function to encode a url.\n\nComments are wild. Some files have almost ever single line covered by a comment like the typically LLM generated code that over explains itself as an example other files have no comments whatsoever. There is no pattern at all like a comment block at the top of each file explaining the file some have these some do not.\n\nThere is a mixture of long winded sentences as function names mixed in with almost code golf style 3 character acronym old school 1980's naming.\n\nIt's using an older version of Rust 1.70.0 not sure why.\n\nThere are a shitload of dependencies here I mean like > 100. The most important seems to be a binding lib to quickjs. To me that's not really writing you own js engine but I guess the authors here didn't review this in any way and because it looks like there is a js engine here that's been custom built then they are happy.\n\nI think my summary is that this is a dead end project that will never see the light of day. There is just too much \"stuff\" here and because the authors let this go way too far before they reviewed the thing or because the didn't really know how to build a properly structured browser this can't really go any further.\n\nI suspect the reason this stopped was that the majority of changes that have been happening on the last few days have seen very little progress but just so many changes i.e. the LLMs are now just \"spinning the plates\" and not really progressing. That means this dude probably is thinking \"I better stop spending money now and just let the world see this and declare success\". A bit like how George W declared missioned accomplished.\n\nTo me this is a cautionary tale. Current day LLMs are not ready to tackle large scale projects like this themselves when they are not driven by people whom have a very clear defined vision of how that project should be structured.",

Have you ever worked on a software project in your life? 80% of requirements are not known before the project starts. The whole point of Agile-craze was prompted by the fact that software requirements were changing all the time and a classic waterfall strategy didn't work. If requirements were \"fixed\" you could easily do waterfall.\n\n> So still hundreds of thousands cheaper than what it would have cost to get a human to develop it.\n\nI can generate 3 million lines of code that doesn't compile to $1.

One thought I had: If the AI is so smart, why can't it make installers so people can try it out?\n\nI cloned the repo and tried to build it. I got several compiler warnings and errors. I thought maybe I should find a different tag to get a working release, but the project has zero tags.\n\nI looked through the repo. It's 63,000 files. All I can say is: *Yes. It certainly looks like the source code for a working web browser.*\n\nI'd dismiss it entirely (especially after seeing another guy on Reddit claim he made an AI-generated browser from scratch that was just a wrapper around a webview control), but a guy on Twitter (who looks legit) says he's a browser developer and got it to compile after two hours of messing with it. He posted screenshots and it looks like the browser renders websites well enough. I trust he isn't fabricating them.\n\nEDIT: Apparently the guy \"fixed it\" by having an LLM just iterate on it until it compiled. It took about two hours.\n\nStill, I'm... deeply skeptical of these [Potemkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potemkin_village) apps. How much of this is \"from scratch\" and how much is libraries? Why should I trust anything he says? This is the CEO of Cursor, which just reskinned Microsoft Visual Studio Code and integrated it with OpenAI and other APIs. They didn't make an editor and they didn't make an LLM fine-tuned for coding. Any engineering team could do that, but Cursor did it first so the company is now ~~worth~~ valued at $29.3 billion.\n\nI don't even think it's worth the time to investigate these claims anymore. I'm tired of cloning the repos and finding code that doesn't compile. I'm tired of pointing out fake screenshots and broken UIs. I'm just going to give \"ok boomer\" responses to AI news:\n\n\"Wow. Big if true.\"",

The focus of mysql/mariadb has always been simple CRUD website backends.

So much code is vanishing by properly using postgres\n* And while rust is not a common web dev language, it is going to have a few key benefits such as; brutally fast, blazingly brutally fast, smooth development experience with everything just working.\n* While the docker is effectively modern linux, it is on a modern linux VM, making it so much easier to maintain with modern firewalls, etc.\n* Logins using oauth.\n\nOne bit of where doing this as a rust monolith is cool, is that after 20 years of operation, I can be fairly certain of the capacity required. Rust's speed allows for an immense amount of capacity on a crap VM, 100's thousands of requests per second. With a monolith, redis type caching is just built into the application.\n\nBut, postgres is allowing for wonderful datastructures to be cooked up. One of my favourites are arrays. This makes most cases for lookup tables go away. The jsonb makes for a wonderful form of denormalization with heavily pre processed data. Combined with caching to drastically reduce db hits, and performance goes through the roof. \n\nA different application I recently built uses postgres's GIS capability. Amazing.",

When you are experienced enough with the language then your development speed isn’t meaningfully slower than when using other languages. People have this idea about rust because when they use it for the first time, it is much slower to write because of its differences with OOP languages. Writing it like an OOP language will cause you to constantly fight the compiler.\n\nI like using it for its high quality pattern matching syntaxes, valued enums, Option (lack of a NULL), Result (high quality error handling), and its trait system. It’s “blazing fast” speed isn’t the only selling point, and it isn’t exclusively nice to use when you have many users.",

My experience is that it is slower up front, but the same slow at the end. \n\nThe usual experience being it is 50% in short order, 90% not long after that, with the last 10% taking twice as long as the 90%; if it ever gets done. Obviously swamped with technical debt.\n\nWith rust projects, I find the technical debt accumulates extremely slowly, as you can depend on earlier code to the extreme.\n\nFor tiny projects where they can accumulate technical debt at almost any speed and still get finished, not so important. \n\nBut, often, I am dealing with projects where the complexity is very high, and technical debt overload is a notable risk.\n\nOne fun one I hit this morning was a particularly grinding file processing step. This was one where even in rust, it is turning the fan on my laptop on, for a single file. Maybe 40 seconds for a file in the top quartile in size.\n\nThe end user is the one uploading these files. Let's just say files per minute might be the measure of the server's performance. \n\nBut, I realized, as a rust wasm application, I can dump that load onto the user, not the server. This may have just changed the server from a 50k per month server to a $10 per month server; as the remaining work is just simple file shuffling, and using highly simplified data extracted from the file by the user.\n\nThe algos to extract the data are not proprietary, thus reverse engineering the wasm isn't a problem.\n\nWhere I find that avoiding some microservices swamp has a huge benefit is simplicity. The key is to ask if complexity is the solution to avoid other complexity. \n\nBut, as I said, one of the real benefits of having such a thing go brutally fast is that it opens up features where responsiveness was a make or break feature.\n\nBut, I've found other minor, but very important benefits to having all the functionality, or at least highly related functionality in the same program. Things like is an administrator logged in? If this is in a shared memory space with instant access, then the confidence in the security can be very high, while the code is extremely simple. Having the data moving through complex paths such as some kind of message queue becomes far cleaner. \n\nOne of the realities I've found with distributed systems is they are effectively multithreaded programming. Most programmers suck at multithreaded programming. Within a single monolith, the threading becomes more, actual threading; and thus it is easier to design an M-N threading model which is then battle hardened.\n\nI would most certainly not recommend this to most people who are not comfortable with this style development. Rust is not an easy language, teams working with compiled codebases require coordination at a level beyond where most people are prepared to go; and this is not an area most people have even toyed with, let alone have experience with.\n\nFor me, and the problems I am solving, it is perfect.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, the web facing part of my work is rarely now users. Most of my work is embedded robotics, sensors, and their interfaces. \n\nSo, for example, I recently made a device (where I used micropython as a test) where there is one user; maybe two. I still made the web interface in rust wasm. This is a toy project, not some mission critical safety critical system.\n\nIt does show this workflow is well fast enough that using my previous decades of experience where I made web stuff \"traditional\" ways was still not easier for me.",

But Johnston had working perceptual coding software in 1987, documented under oath in court records. Both streams of research mattered.

English being my 2nd language.\n- I used Thompson as a reference, I meant the france company not the person\n- to explain all the intricate details I needed to write way more, but I choose to summarize in an equally superficial way\n\nOn to your reaction:\nThere is a motivation why I even bothered to write in an day old post like this.\n\nMainly the annoyance with the ever repeating distortion of history. Again and again Media such as this reframes collectiv human efforts in a way that frames a limited number of people as sole magician of the new arcane. But thats seldom enough, there is also the need to nationalize the narrative. To force it down and bind it to a perversed limited view.\n\nHere you posted a story of a man left with limited notice to his efforts. Being exclude from the grand narrative stated before.\n\nWhat I was trying to express was that this grand narrative in itself was flawed and wrong in the way it was presented. To my that story is part of a collection of storie: \"the broad and superficial self gradulation of the american mind\".\n\nAgain and again, when any form of Kopernican Revolution are changing the views of an topic, here the encoding of sound,  an intrusive narrative is spune. An american side character takes center stage, saving the day. Almost always independent of what really happend. Missing all the little people who actually planed and build the pyramids.\n\nHere an extraordinary massive part of the actual science was done by drone like minons in the university of erlangen. 4th semester students, to diplomstudents. Helpers helper. All put together, orchestrated by Musmann, long before any Idea of a standard. The collaboration was born because of ISDN. Thats why the france and the bell labs wanted in. Super cheap digital telephony over glass fiber. The music part was an addition for phone loops. Nothing more. Thats where it started. \n\nThey needed Musmanns expertise, got the data long before starting themselves. And building on that.Alot of the really hard bits were already found solutions for, what was left was variations.\n\nAs for the american judicial system in question of inventions. Its has a  horrible history winning liars and cheater. Stealing from all over the world, silencing the true owner. I have no idea what exactly this lawsuit was realy about. But I know that all the titles an accolades are not as earned as presented.\n\nI hope you can follow now why Zuse and the digital network had its place here.\n\nAnd also the other reasion I was annoyed, triggered even, by the article:\n\nI had a stind of 1 semester as an post doc at erlangen. I was brought to a alumni after party in the late 2000s. There I had the pleasure to listen to the stories of the small people, the greavens over the absolut arrogance of the bell lab people. How the bell lab people seemed to be under so much pressure that they constantly tried to reframe ideas of the team as their own. That some diploma final works had to be scraped because the ideas and data was already published without respectfull communication. How the france company was basically fobbed out of millions, thanks to the american way of working. How many were disillusioned by working with so called the best of the best, because some of the stars beyond the pond couldnt even build the experiments correctly without stealing from 22 year old german nobodies who just got pennies because it was just an helper job.\n\nAs my own jorney later on brought me to surprisingly simular realisations. I worked with almost matha-magical indians, chinese, russian and other europeans who had to work with  american companies and universities. \n\nThe pure horror of the in part abysmal differences in competence are still personal horror stories. A few of which are public known by many as grand american successes.\n\nAnd so. Same as it ever was.",

TDAC provided efficient critically sampled representations for subband coding applications. Building on this, a 1987 refinement by Princen, A. W.

Two separate facts got mashed together. *My bad. Reddit won't let me fix the title, only the body - ugh*.\n\n**I should have been clearer about audience.** Multiple commenters noted that JJ is well known in the audio coding community - AES, IEEE, MPEG circles. That's true. The article is addressing the *popular* narrative: Wikipedia, mainstream tech journalism, the \"who invented MP3\" Google results. Among peers, Johnston is respected. In public tech history, he's largely absent while Brandenburg gets the \"lone inventor\" treatment.\n\n**The MDCT point is in the article, but could be clearer.** Johnston contributed psychoacoustic modeling; Brandenburg brought MDCT from the Surrey work. The article says \"Brandenburg brought MDCT; Johnston brought perceptual modeling. Neither had the complete picture alone.\" But I can see how that got lost.\n\nI will update the doc to address these points. Also got a comment from Howie Singer, who was actually *at* a2b and wrote a book on it - so there's more to dig into there!\n\nAppreciate the corrections and the good-faith debate.

MDCT improves significantly on that by having the blocks overlap so that there are no discontinuities when the transformed data is manipulated (by quantization).",

GPT-3 was supposedly so powerful OpenAI refused to release the trained model because of “concerns about malicious applications of the technology”.\n\nIt also links to the GPT-3 [announcement](https://openai.com/index/better-language-models/) where OpenAI said that they were reluctant to release it. \n\nWhy were they reluctant?\n\n“We can also imagine the application of these models for malicious purposes⁠, including the following (or other applications we can’t yet anticipate):\n\nGenerate misleading news articles\n\nImpersonate others online\n\nAutomate the production of abusive or faked content to post on social media\n\nAutomate the production of spam/phishing content\n“\n\nGood thing those fears were so overblown! Turns out those liars at OpenAI claimed we might end up a world filled with blog spam and link spam and comment spam but good thing none of that ever happened! It was all just a con, and there were no negative repercussions to releasing the technology at all!",

We have done this before, we are just repeating it again but with more hardware and the bubble is much bigger this time. Look at the history of the Symbolics Corporation for a geeky history lesson.\n\nIf we got anything out of this bubble it is better compression techniques for raw text... though it is completely destructive and irreversible and actually is not compression at all (tokenization)... \n\nActually I am not sure what this AI bubble has given us that we did not have from the 80's. Just the same shit done faster. Full text search is still better than a LLM when you need to cite sources / find the original content or want actually relevant results not crawled a year ago. \n\nReally the coolest shit is being done with machine learning, especially the computer vision side that lets us spot cancer in images or identify birds or bird songs. Even google knows this, and it is why you have to click the blocks with a motorcycle on pages to identify your not a robot, when really your helping tag objects for their computer vision models.",

He does so on almost a weekly basis.\n\nWe also have their internal emails from the early days when they expressed the same fears. Their INTERNAL, PRIVATE emails said:\n\n“The goal of OpenAI is to make the future good and to avoid an AGI dictatorship,” Altman wrote. “You are concerned that Demis [Hassabis, the founder of Google’s DeepMind AI lab] could create an AGI dictatorship. So [are] we. So it is a bad idea to create a structure where you could become a dictator if you chose to, especially given that we can create some other structure that avoids this possibility.”\n\nRecall as well that the organization was founded as a non-profit. This was a recruiting tool because they believed that many top researchers believed that AI was dangerous and could be better managed by a non-profit.

The big one is obviously financial/securities regulation avoidance. They can extract tons of wealth from both institutional and retail investors by creating attractive signals in the stock market with their revenue cycles.

Because you use the same tools to debug and explain the code that you use to write it. I can with an LLM and my decades of experience pull up a completely foreign code base and understand what’s going on and where the critical code is quickly. Searching and doing debugging by hand and with the LLM is trivial and the same as it ever was. Then writing the prompts to fix code that’s already written is easier (in most cases, UI notwithstanding) than the initial build. \n\nIf you are reviewing changes every time an LLM makes it, you’ll understand the code just fine and catch the problems. In my experience the more mature the project is, the less issues I have and the more I can trust the agent because there’s enough examples for the agent to follow. \n\nIt’s really strange to me that we programmers have been given power tools and everyone would rather sand by hand.

This is the third time I've struggled on something complex/gnarly for an hour on and off with CC, then 5 Pro goes off for 10 minutes and comes back with code that works out of the box. I had CC read the 5 Pro version and it wrote up 2 paragraphs admiring it (very wholesome). If you're not giving it your hardest problems you're probably missing out. https://xcancel.com/karpathy/status/1964020416139448359\n\nOpus 4.5 is very good.

The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind. https://xcancel.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521?s=20\n\nCreator of Tailwind CSS in response: The people who don't feel this way are the ones who are fucked, honestly. https://xcancel.com/adamwathan/status/2004722869658349796\n\nStanford CS PhD with almost 20k citations: I think this is right. I am not sold on AGI claims, but LLM guided programming is probably the biggest shift in software engineering in several decades, maybe since the advent of compilers. As an open source maintainer of @deep_chem, the deluge of low effort PRs is difficult to handle.

It’s slop”.\n\nCreator of Vue JS and Vite, Evan You, \"Gemini 2.5 pro is really really good.\" https://xcancel.com/youyuxi/status/1910509965208674701\n\nCreator of Ruby on Rails + Omarchy:\n\n Opus, Gemini 3, and MiniMax M2.1 are the first models I've thrown at major code bases like Rails and Basecamp where I've been genuinely impressed. By no means perfect, and you couldn't just let them vibe, but the speed-up is now undeniable. I still love to write code by hand, but you're cheating yourself if you don't at least have a look at what the frontier is like at the moment. This is an incredible time to be alive and to be into computers. https://xcancel.com/dhh/status/2004963782662250914\n\nI used it for the latest Rails.app.creds feature to flesh things out. Used it to find a Rails regression with IRB in Basecamp. Used it to flesh out some agent API adapters. I've tried most of the Claude models, and Opus 4.5 feels substantially different to me. It jumped from \"this is neat\" to \"damn I can actually use this\". https://xcancel.com/dhh/status/2004977654852956359\n\nClaude 4.5 Opus with Claude Code been one of the models that have impressed me the most. It found a tricky Rails regression with some wild and quick inquiries into Ruby innards. https://xcancel.com/dhh/status/2004965767113023581?s=20\n\nHe’s not just hyping AI: pure vibe coding remains an aspirational dream for professional work for me, for now. Supervised collaboration, though, is here today. I've worked alongside agents to fix small bugs, finish substantial features, and get several drafts on major new initiatives. The paradigm shift finally feels real. Now, it all depends on what you're working on, and what your expectations are. The hype train keeps accelerating, and if you bought the pitch that we're five minutes away from putting all professional programmers out of a job, you'll be disappointed. I'm nowhere close to the claims of having agents write 90%+ of the code, as I see some boast about online. I don't know what code they're writing to hit those rates, but that's way off what I'm able to achieve, if I hold the line on quality and cohesion. https://world.hey.com/dhh/promoting-ai-agents-3ee04945",

Creating the environment in which a non-deterministic AI model can be run reliably takes a lot of effort, but the rewards can be software that is both quick to write AND better than what we used to have. In that space, the market for slop isn't looking great.",

Trained people are able to make decisions faster and take more reliable actions in the long run.\n\nThe  'Oh, so glorious' 'thought' pattern of LLMs means spitting out statistically common information. Statistically, most people write shitty code and make dumb mistakes due to (lack of) their training. And this is the same shit an LLM is going to produce as code.\n\nFew months ago, I read an article about Magnus Carlsen who beat an LLM in a game of chess without giving up a single piece. I don't know if it's true, but you see my point: (statistically) most people play low-quality chess and cannot meet the expectations of a trained professional. LLMs amplify the difference, not make it.\n\n'It's in my input/training data, so it is true' or 'I mix related things to cover that I don't know much about the topic' are not reliable principles in real life.

And to demonstrate just how wrong the current corporate grift is, look at how much hardware and power they're wasting on their glorified autocorrect and then compare that to a human brain which is incomparably more powerful but operates on only about 20 Watts.

When we got C we gained more leverage but gave up control of specifics of memory registers, etc. When we got Java we gave up control of memory management. SQL allowed us to be declarative and not worry about the \"how\". AI seems to align with this.

Most late stories would be pair programmed with someone who finished their work and was trying to start something new. And if they couldn’t help them then I (the de facto principal) would step in.\n\nSo what happened is that the Work Expanded. To help keep the overall project on schedule, we started taking on more work at the boundaries between our domain and the teams we interacted with. It was more work but also more status, because every time we took over a chunk of functionality, our mandate expanded and the other team’s narrowed. \n\nIn fact in the end I came to believe that was how this company operated. They threw people at big projects and the islands of competence would crystallize and expand until they touched each other, filling in the available problem space sufficiently to meet the spirit of the Swiss Cheese Model of reliability.",

If the CI is solid - and fast - and the dev doesn’t make transcription errors, an estimate of fifteen minutes or an hour is often enough pretty close to accurate. But if a build fails and CI dominates the code-build-test cycle then Hofstader isn’t even enough buffer. \n\nBut other due dates are flexible, and business people are always hungry for more functionality and once they get on the board they will “clarify” what the purpose of the story is by trying to make three features sound like one.

I told him I could lower the estimate but it'd still get done in the time I thought it'd get done in.\n\n\nOur new developer on our team was constantly blowing his estimates out by huge margins and working a lot of overtime because of it. I told him \"You're just estimating the time you think it'll take to code it. You're not accounting for unit tests, integration testing, build instrumentation, meetings, interruptions, documentation, or Jira bookkeeping. Multiply your gut answer by four and if the number you get is less than two days, estimate two days.\" That's a starting point, but it'll be way more accurate than the \"couple of hours\" every junior level guy thinks every task will take.\n\n\nWith that baseline, you can then pay attention to whether your estimates are generally too high or two low. This is an ongoing process as you'll get more comfortable with the code base and processes of the team with time.\n\n\nI've found this to be very effective, to the point where I'm very sure of my time estimates and they're usually accurate to within plus or minus half a day. If I notice I'm regularly finishing sooner than I expected, I start tweaking them down a bit. If I find I'm regularly missing them by a day or more, I start tweaking them up a bit.

With Agile we don’t let people think too much about when the whole thing will be “Done”. “Done” being a lie anyway, except for the Minimum Viable Product. Because if it’s a hit we are going to iterate on it until the money runs out or the company gets bought. So there’s no Done, only What’s Next. The only Done is the end of What’s Next. \n\nWhen Agile was new this was a hard pill to swallow, like explaining the virtues of an Arnold Palmer to an alcoholic. You have to first embrace that “drinking” is hurting you before the alternative doesn’t look silly or broken. And most companies hadn’t embraced it, and some were bankrupted by people who did. So then fear chased many companies into it which is how we ended up with Scrum everywhere. The worst version of Agile from a process improvement instead of an extractive model.",

If you do things like tell it to analyze some code and consider ways to refactor it, it will absolutely find ways to refactor it, even if the current implementation is probably the best way to do it. If you tell it to look for bugs in code, it will find bugs. No matter how obscure or unlikely or irrelevant, they are.

This appeared to be an instance of genuine, if primitive, artificial intelligence. That was nine years ago.  \n\nSubsequently, much larger sets of training data were used and the developers began scraping web content in a wholesale manner to create enormous training sets. By the era of ChatGPT3, when OpenAI locked down access to its formerly open source project, they were using 60% of the data in the Common Crawl database which is a large chunk of the Internet Archive. \n\nThere is no second internet to scrape. The data that was contained in the earlier training sets is all we've got. It's what humanity has to offer. You can filter it in different ways but the progress that was made between 2017 and 2022 are not going to be repeated because there is nowhere to turn for new training data. You can re-filter what you've already got but that's not as simple as what went before. \n\nMoreover, you've now got your data poisoned by the abundance of AI generated content that has already been published in the last five years. Simultaneously, progress in computer hardware has nearly come to a halt while costs to manufacture slightly more efficient chips have grown exponentially. The meat has been picked off the bones, the skin and sinews devoured and now there are bunch of hungry carnivores left to fight over what's remains of the bone marrow.",

There's existing code I've written that defines access at a bulk level. Separately, there's code that defines labels at a row level, but not a bulk level like access. \n\nExpanding this bulk feature to include labels needs programming, not engineering. I've already done the engineering when I considered the so many things around this picture (AWS API infrastructure, hosting for application, request protocol, proxy layer for auth, data layer for query invalidation), what I need is more programming (putting the square block in the square hole, use a similar api handler, db query and transactions that already exist). \n\nI can't exactly see myself riding the hype train when I can review code that genuinely satisfies a proper implementation to fit these scenarios. \n\nI was skeptical too before I saw what Cursor is able to pull off when engineering decisions have already been made and are clearly defined, such as my infrastructure being defined in code as well (SST)",

It's still bundled with Wordpress and all the tutorials use it. The frontend de jour isn't as big of a deal in the real world.

The benefit of the d3 way seems to just be if you want to do d3 transitions, which do are still more fully featured than most things you might replace them with.\n\nAll that said, I used to be making more flashy and ambitious visualizations with d3, with my current role being more conservative and having me mostly focus on the data going into them.

We plan to remove support in stages, and the next step will be released in jQuery 5.0.\n\nThey're actually planning to release more major versions, too. Makes sense to drop support for older browsers, but it also kinda feel like that might be a good reason to want to use jQuery, to support complex scripting in retro browsers, as niche as that use case may be.\n\nAnyway, I don't think there's really a good argument for using jQuery for new projects these days. Plain JS does everything you want and it's more or less just as convenient. I do believe that DOM manipulation can still be somewhat complicated and verbose in plain JS, though, and jQuery has a nice set of helper functions for it that are pretty powerful. It's not really worth using it just for that, but this is an area where plain JS has always been a little bit unnecessarily awkward.",

Each fab is at least a billion dollars in upfront costs. If the demand for GPU/RAM crashes in the year it takes to get built, it's a net loss for the company. The current capacity is just enough to supply the business market by sacrificing the consumer market, and us consumers will either:\n\n- wait it out\n\n- buy anyways\n\nEither way, it's a win for the manufacturer which will raise prices that will take years to go back down. The only reason the prices would drop sharply would be to have an oversupply, which can't happen because fabs are not getting built.",

The examples given are really simplistic.\n\nIt's kind of a very long tweet even if I strongly agree with the sentiments.",

If you completed a task, you got the points, the tasks were reviewed, and the reviewer got 1/3rd the points. \n\nAny minor bug in the task had to be fixed quickly to retain the points, major bugs, lost everyone the points.\n\nThen, a bonus pool was allotted, and each got their share based on their share of the points.\n\nThe founders aggressively watched for people working too many hours, this was one of very few firing offences up there with sexual harassment. \n\nThey had a system where each task got a red, orange, or green code. Red tasks had to be done before orange, and orange before green; assuming you had the ability to do the red or orange tasks. Each task had points assigned to it by the founders, but anyone could suggest a task. Someone might say, \"Rewrite the entire system in Go\" and the founders might assign that -1,000,000 points as a hard no.\n\nBut, you might say, \"Experimentally rewrite the comms module in rust and compare performance.\" and this might get 100 points. Changing the wording of \"Open File\" to \"Open PDF\" in a menu might be 1 point.\n\nAnyone could pick any task; but only one task at a time. Anyone could code review. But, if your code was consistently crap, the people who were really good at code reviews would stop reviewing your code as they weren't getting points from it, and you would stop getting points. Thus a crap programmer would just eventually quit. You didn't want to take your code to a crap reviewer as they would miss bugs, and you could lose points. You didn't take your code to the pedantic fool who focused on code style guides made up in their head, and ignored brutalizing your code with potentially their own unit tests like the great code reviewers would do.\n\nOn the point of juniors. This was a great environment for ones with potential; as code reviewers would tell them what would be needed for them to fix up their code, and be better prepared for their next review. Also, juniors could pair program, as this would increase the points by 20%. That is if something was worth 30 points, and two people paired on it, they would each get 18 points. People were willing to do this with promising juniors.\n\nThings like people with poor communications skills almost instantly floundered and soon left; as nobody told them what to do, you had to ask and figure things out.\n\nThe difference in take home pay could be enormous. People who were OK, and did stick around might pull in 100k or less. But a coding performance monster could easily crack 1m. There were people pulling in more than this who worked a day or two a week and took massive vacations. They would just knock off one brutally hard task after another with really good code for the time they were there. The point pool might be 8m points, and these guys could come in and knock off 10 1k tasks in a single week. These were tasks that most programmers would choke on and give up after a month. A task might be, \"Get the present messaging system past 100k messages per second. with 10 points awarded for every 1k messages per second more; max 1k points. And these guy would make an FPGA network card which could handle 2m messages per second. Nobody even thought of building their own network card and were thinking about screwing with the linux network stack or something.\n\nThese were the people who kept moving the needle forward for the company and were well rewarded for doing so. This incentive structure would then attract more of these stars; often not because they could earn so much, but earn lots while working very very little and not be pressured to work 60h+ for the same pay at most other places. \n\nThe best part of this place is watching the fogies try to explain to me why the place didn't work. Some people simply can't wrap their heads around such a different culture. They live in worlds where micromanagers use gantt charts to populate jira task lists, and by putting them on a kanban board they think they are being modern. But, all they do is assign tasks, wonder why people aren't being creative, complain about \"herding cats\" and then watch as their uninspired projects run wildly overbudget, are late, and really disappoint the end users (oh, I should have called them stakeholders).",

TL;DR: I quantize the components of the sampling (shape) vector to one of 8 possible values and use those to construct a cache key. I then use that to create a lookup table around 2MB in size, which makes lookups very, very cheap.\n\nBut yeah, a lot of effort went into making this run smoothly on mobile. The other primary performance concern is collecting the sampling vectors themselves and performing contrast enhancement, both of which I needed to delegate to the GPU. On my (admittedly powerful) laptop, the full pipeline for rendering a frame takes around 2ms. The [appendix on GPU acceleration](https://alexharri.com/blog/ascii-rendering#appendix-gpu-acceleration) briefly covers this.\n\nBut no plans to implement color for now. It would be interesting to look at, though!",

Cloudflare was perfectly capable of developing their own fork for Cloudflare-specific functionality. Instead, they now have full control (like Shopify wanted with Ruby) and ownership of the trademark/brand/developer goodwill. They will integrate their own changes as needed (as they could/did do before) while leaning on the OSS community to make up the difference and -crucially- fully maintain those features that Cloudflare feels it will see no ROI on, while rejecting those very PRs from OSS devs because they \"would constitute an ongoing maintenance burden\"\n\nMIT license will become SSPL/open core before long, unless we want to ignore the experience of history.",

Yes they're both \"companies\" but if that's the only information you judge on, how accurate can you be?\n\nCloudflare won't aim to shut down other website builders, because they don't make money on that. WordPress, however, has their entire business model dependent on it being \"hard\" to make your own website, and \"hard\" to find a host. Ergo, if they bought up this option, they would be incentived to put it behind a paywall or shut it down.\n\nCloudflare, on the other hand, doesn't make their money by charging to help create a website. They make their money by their pro services required for hosting non-trivial content (i.e. databases, lamdas, etc). And they can recognize that Astro only works because it's not paid (it's market is developers who know how to code, unlike WordPress).\n\nSo, yes, if you take the view that \"muh corporation runs software now\", it's equally as bad if any company runs it. But, if you have a bit of nuance you might realize that actually there are better or worse things that can happen to software.\n\nIf Cloudflare switches up, and tries to close-source this, or charge for currently free features, I would be SHOCKED. And I'd instantly call that out as a bad thing. But, that hasnt happened, doesn't seem like it will happen, and again, would probably be a dumb move.\n\nI don't think you've actually used Cloudflare, and know what I'm trying it say. If you had, you would know they actually offer a ton of free services to small developers (like Cloudflare pages, with more features than GitHub pages), among dozens of others.",

This is all in service of solving a CVE that has been outstanding for ten years and that upstream perl does not consider a bug.\n\nIMO, this whole hardened image / container scanning ecosystem is selling you a solution to a nonexistent problem.

Literal \"shovelware\" is mostly uncomitted and unpublished but is happening a lot more with LLMs now.\n\n  Things like small scripts for one-off things to do something that one person could easily write without LLM in an hour, but another person would need a few days to think through. Or prototyping a few concepts of a thing before starting real work. Or a new project to just check a specific library but you still need a whole app to really see this one library\n\n  Personally at work I was investigating latency in ROS topics from cameras and claude code wrote a few scripts to measure things in a few minutes. It didn't fully make sense - one script checking the required thing should be enough, there was a lot of redundancy. But one of them did what I wanted. It would take me a few hours to write it myself just because there were things I didn't do before. It worked, I found out the problem. I fixed the problem with comments on what was happening. I didn't commit a bunch of LLM-generated scripts.\n\n  2. Also some of it is published, but then some of the published stuff is just good. I don't want to get into details of specific commits in specific software and argue if it's \"shovelware\" or not. But smart and experienced people use code produced with LLM tools. Here is a video I would recommend with some examples, but it's rambling on the topic so might not be your thing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vp9ypOUgMw\n\n  3.

My theory about why there’s not end to end high quality demos is cos it doesn’t actually save you that much time, and most of it is pretty unsexy reprompting snd trying to understand what you’ve just written yourself. Theres a totally different productivity curve throughout the week though. I got SO MUCH done in the first half-day/day, but the it really flattens out in the tail end, solving the truly complex parts of it get very tedious when you try vibe through it, final integration work, making sure your tests aren’t complete junk.\n\nMy verdict so far: Definitely some time improvement, But not super dramatic (something less than 2x). I think I was “braver” in attempting some features I might have otherwise left in the too hard basket given the timeframe. So in that sense there’s some value improvement too. I’m also probably in a better place with tests and docs than I would be in the same timeframe otherwise. \n\nThey’re all marginal improvements and hard to quantify, and most of the meaningful work comes from frustrating attempts to prompt in specific ways and really interrogate an understanding of the machine - to must engineers that’s a revolting concept . Doesn’t make good watching - you should understand the machine before you write the code.\n\nNow apparently I’ve blown through my credits this week too so I need to see what the direct additional costs are to work this way, because there’s a lot of “soft costs” too.",

I also tried to do vibe coding in the recent past, although it was before all this agentic stuff really got traction.\n\nMy impressions were close to yours. I got excited cause the machine was writing code and the possibilities, but it quickly turned into frustration. I realized fast that I needed to read what it wrote very carefully cause it often forgot important details. And read it again on the next output, cause it could forget another thing OR the same thing I asked it to include for some reason. In the end, I felt like I was wasting time trying to steer the machine into what I wanted, just to in the end correct it myself...instead of, you know, just writing the code already in the first place.\n\nEither way, I find these tools useful when I ask it about documentation. Not writing, but finding stuff. For example, if I don't know how to do something with some library, I can ask it to find that information and link it to me. It often works, and if it doesn't it is not a major problem. I can ask it to look for examples on how X works and that is pretty useful. I also used it to scaffold unit tests, and it can save *some* time in this use case.",

Either the list of files (hardcoded) was cut from the output, or it hallucinated elements of the list. The commands didn't worked cause it got confused on what was a Windows utility and a GNU program. It was a mess. I had to fiddle with the fucking prompt to even get something that would execute - and the final result was wrong cause it forgot to correctly delete certain folders, which meant I had to check the entire script anyway.\n\nI gave up, opened the script and rewrote it myself.
