Arguaby, it might have been quicker to use an LLM to rewrite that component from scratch and then integrate it.\n\nThis has three major implications: \n\n(1) vibe coding has a natural limit, when code complexity has increased so much that forward progress on prototypes even with LLM support stalls because every step breaks as much as it adds\n\n(2) the deferred/maintenance cost of LLM supported coding is tremendous, and as so often in software engineering, the immediate measurable (lines of code/progress # of features) doesn't accurately reflect the total cost (surprise bug trail and much larger maintenance costs)\n\n(3) Experienced software engineers controlling and pushing back against poorly orthogonalized changes from LLM agents have major value in development going forward.

Sounds like marketing and interaction bait to me - after all I had to give them my work email just to read the damn paper. \n\nNadella's numbers about productivity gains certainly are doubtful to some extent, but at least they have real data about the latest GHCP usage and correlation to some loose productivity metrics like Lines of Code or tasks closed.

Thanks for raising this feedback.\n\nThe agents did build out major subsystems including JS VM, DOM, CSS cascade, inline/block/table layouts, text pipelines, paint systems, chrome, and more. As the research experiment continues to run, the scope will increase and some parts that use dependencies will be migrated.\n\nI've merged a more up-to-date snapshot from the system's progress that resolved some build issues. The experimental harness can occasionally leave the repo in an incomplete state but does converge, which was the case at the time of the post.",

So they spent the cost for hiring a team of 100 SEs for a month or two and got some code that doesn't compile out of it, and then made a blog post about how amazing their tools are.",

It's a shame half the industry is focusing on \"autonomous agents can build without programmers\" when clearly \"programmers proficient with using LLMs for development\" is such an obviously better approach, especially if you have even the slightest requirement of quality.\n\nI disagree with that Cursor is a good tool for that, but I think that's more personal/subjective opinion, and probably because my bar for \"high quality code\" is pretty high. Tried Claude Code for a while too, but also requires a ton of more prompting to get the best code out of it. In the end, Codex seems to do the best job of actually making sure to follow all instructions and high quality code, although it takes the longest to actually finish.

(One of the errors i pointed out turns out he fixed it by adding a check at the beginning of the function that basically always returned true in an obfuscated way but didn't actually run)\n\n- Random bugs and small quirks added that only becomes clearer once you actually start to use the program \n\n\nA lot like AI images when you see them you see that they are AI, but you cant put your finger on it. until you start pay attention and you see the 7 fingers and the weird nonsensical stuff in the background.\n\nStill better than Claude 4 was (last one I tried a couple of months before, when everyone was saying that programming is over for humans). But I'll wait for claude 5 next, people say 4.5 is there with Gemini 3, but I dont think is close enough that even if it is slightly better might make me more efficient.\n\nRight now its just slowing me down.\n\nI still use auto completion, always did, I like it because when the code is terrible is a keystroke to delete it and I control the full context and can fix it in the moment instead of having to wait for to go back and tey to understand what the fuck they did.",

That's the main thing that separates successful tech companies from shitty tech companies. In shitty companies, the CEO is often a business major that could not write a hello world script. But in the most successful tech companies that's not usually the case anymore. There was a really big shift in this about 15 years ago or so when the tech world collectively realized that people with zero science or engineering background tend to make really terrible CEOs when the company specializes in advanced technology. For example, Sundar Pichai of Google is an engineer, im sure he can write a hello world. Jensen Huang is an engineer, Lisa Su of AMD is an engineer, Tim Cook of apple is an engineer, Satya Nadella is an engineer. Even Jeff Bezos has a degree in engineering.",

It'll build up context scanning relevant areas of the code, reading documentation, etc. and go back and forth with clarifying questions on the requirements.

While you are growing to domination, the market loves you, but once you achieve dominance, the market lops 75% or more off your value in a single stroke if they do not trust your pricing power.\n>\n> Which is why growth-stock companies are always desperately pumping up one bubble or another, spending billions to hype the pivot to video or cryptocurrency or NFTs or the metaverse or AI.\n>\n> I am not saying that tech bosses are making bets they do not plan on winning. But winning the bet – creating a viable metaverse – is the secondary goal. The primary goal is to keep the market convinced that your company will continue to grow, and to remain convinced until the next bubble comes along.\n>\n> So this is why they’re hyping AI.\n\n- https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/18/tech-ai-bubble-burst-reverse-centaur\n\nWe can tell them *all day long* that this doesn't work, has never worked, and will never work. But the CEO of tech companies don't care. And no amount of repetition will make them get a clue about this. Because THEY DO NOT CARE if the tech works or not. It's all about pumping up a bubble. Always has been. They are trying to keep the stock price as high as possible. All other considerations are secondary.",

Only problem the proprietary build system won't build the files, And you can't use yocto because you haven't updated the Recipe... I mean that stuff is normal. \n\nSo what does AI want to do? \n\n1. Write fake fucking Project files for EVERY project it wants to pull it, it gave up after 4 (I knew this was a bad idea from 1).\n2. Stub out our analytics code... But I wanted it to create real artifacts to make this code work and be able to be tested.\n3. Compile under X86 instead of the architecture it was needed for.. .ALSO stub out the code... because why not bring back a bad idea for a third round (probably even higher than that). \n4. Rewrite cmake from the ground up so it would work like yocto   (Literally asked it \"Are you serious?\"  And it realized that was a fucking stupid idea... ) \n\nMy point being... it's GREAT when you haven't read the docs, or you don't want to figure out the build system every time, and you need to push something to git.   It's awful when you run into a problem that isn't already documented somewhere else. \n\nSo no... Ai is not Ready to replace Junior Developers, and it's OBVIOUSLY not.   \n\nAnd again I like AI, I think it's a very useful tool, but it's a useful TOOL.  It's the user of the tool that's responsible.   It makes you more effective, it doesn't replace anyone. \n\nBut anyone who thinks otherwise....well either isn't making it do something interesting or novel or unique, or has gotten EXTREMELY lucky and never really tested it outside of that one point.\n\nPS. That story about \"AI figured out what took us 6 months to figure out.\"  I would put SERIOUS heavy money on the fact that ... the AI read their design documents....    \n\nAlso that example?  it created a prototype, if they could only make a prototype in 6 months... that's a bad sign on them.\n\nEdit: Got another story \"Let's use Sqllite instead of Mysql for local dev.\" ... spoiler, a lot of the migration scripts were designed for mysql.. THATS WHY WE DONT CHANGE DATABASES ON A FUCKING WIM.   Oh and it didn't use mysql, it used mariadb... ugh.",

The information was encrypted and our job was to find the key by optimizing provided C code that would normally take years to finish, with no further information provided.\n\nReading the code made it immediately clear to me that they were computing the area of a huge circle in the most inefficient way imaginable, so I just replaced that code with the regular circle area formula, computed the result as an approximate floating-point number in a single operation, converted it to an integer, and then interleaved incremental additions and subtractions to brute-force the key until the decrypted result contained something resembling an E-mail address, at which point the exact value was found and the challenge was cleared.\n\nOnce I found the address I just E-mailed them the code and results, which ran so fast on my own computer that just a naive `times` command just returned 0.0 for all system, user, and real time values on Linux. They weren't expecting that solution, said that the fastest version they had internally took 0.3 seconds to run on their systems, and in the end I just told them that I wasn't really interested in the job because it was way too far away from home but found the challenge interesting and definitely uncommon. I never got to read their internal solution so up to this day I haven't figured out exactly what their own train of thought actually was, or even whether they intended the problem to be interpreted as just finding the area of a circle, but that's how I inferred the problem from the provided code and that was the optimal solution that I found.",

The other 1/3 are real programmers and we end up taking maybe 1 of 20 applicants.\n\nFor example we're looking for senior full stack devs (>5 yoe) and lots of people send in applications for that without any background in IT/CS and without being able to tell the interviewer what an IP address is or what the differences between compiled and interpreted languages are. I'm very positive that those people also wouldn't be able to solve that simple code puzzle correctly, or any other code puzzle really.\n\nSo yes, a test like this will absolutely filter out all those non-technical applicants that are applying for roles that they're completely unfit for whatever reason.

Back in the 1980's when I attended university then all you could take into an exam was paper, pen and calculator but only normal calculators that could do basic arithmetic because programmable HP calculators were just appearing and those were banned from the exam room.",

Its admission control, scheduling and QoS are primitive to non-existent. Performance analysis at runtime is pretty limited. No native metrics or tracing capabilities. I could go on. And on. \n\nIt's a no brainer to use for most things but MySQL's issues come from the Oracle acquisition as much as anything postgres related.\n\nIt would be fascinating if someone bolted the postgres protocol and high level SQL dialect onto MySQL/MariaDB, Redshift/Aurora style.

(Technically, an early version of mariadb).\n\nIt is moving to nginx, rust, and postgres. \n\nWow, what a wildly different development experience:\n\n* Docker makes everything cleaner, \n* nginx is so much less painful, and fast.\n* postgres, the features I can use here are amazing. So much code is vanishing by properly using postgres\n* And while rust is not a common web dev language, it is going to have a few key benefits such as; brutally fast, blazingly brutally fast, smooth development experience with everything just working.\n* While the docker is effectively modern linux, it is on a modern linux VM, making it so much easier to maintain with modern firewalls, etc.\n* Logins using oauth.\n\nOne bit of where doing this as a rust monolith is cool, is that after 20 years of operation, I can be fairly certain of the capacity required. Rust's speed allows for an immense amount of capacity on a crap VM, 100's thousands of requests per second. With a monolith, redis type caching is just built into the application.\n\nBut, postgres is allowing for wonderful datastructures to be cooked up. One of my favourites are arrays. This makes most cases for lookup tables go away. The jsonb makes for a wonderful form of denormalization with heavily pre processed data. Combined with caching to drastically reduce db hits, and performance goes through the roof. \n\nA different application I recently built uses postgres's GIS capability. Amazing.",

My experience is that it is slower up front, but the same slow at the end. \n\nThe usual experience being it is 50% in short order, 90% not long after that, with the last 10% taking twice as long as the 90%; if it ever gets done. Obviously swamped with technical debt.\n\nWith rust projects, I find the technical debt accumulates extremely slowly, as you can depend on earlier code to the extreme.\n\nFor tiny projects where they can accumulate technical debt at almost any speed and still get finished, not so important. \n\nBut, often, I am dealing with projects where the complexity is very high, and technical debt overload is a notable risk.\n\nOne fun one I hit this morning was a particularly grinding file processing step. This was one where even in rust, it is turning the fan on my laptop on, for a single file. Maybe 40 seconds for a file in the top quartile in size.\n\nThe end user is the one uploading these files. Let's just say files per minute might be the measure of the server's performance. \n\nBut, I realized, as a rust wasm application, I can dump that load onto the user, not the server. This may have just changed the server from a 50k per month server to a $10 per month server; as the remaining work is just simple file shuffling, and using highly simplified data extracted from the file by the user.\n\nThe algos to extract the data are not proprietary, thus reverse engineering the wasm isn't a problem.\n\nWhere I find that avoiding some microservices swamp has a huge benefit is simplicity. The key is to ask if complexity is the solution to avoid other complexity. \n\nBut, as I said, one of the real benefits of having such a thing go brutally fast is that it opens up features where responsiveness was a make or break feature.\n\nBut, I've found other minor, but very important benefits to having all the functionality, or at least highly related functionality in the same program. Things like is an administrator logged in? If this is in a shared memory space with instant access, then the confidence in the security can be very high, while the code is extremely simple. Having the data moving through complex paths such as some kind of message queue becomes far cleaner. \n\nOne of the realities I've found with distributed systems is they are effectively multithreaded programming. Most programmers suck at multithreaded programming. Within a single monolith, the threading becomes more, actual threading; and thus it is easier to design an M-N threading model which is then battle hardened.\n\nI would most certainly not recommend this to most people who are not comfortable with this style development. Rust is not an easy language, teams working with compiled codebases require coordination at a level beyond where most people are prepared to go; and this is not an area most people have even toyed with, let alone have experience with.\n\nFor me, and the problems I am solving, it is perfect.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, the web facing part of my work is rarely now users. Most of my work is embedded robotics, sensors, and their interfaces. \n\nSo, for example, I recently made a device (where I used micropython as a test) where there is one user; maybe two. I still made the web interface in rust wasm. This is a toy project, not some mission critical safety critical system.\n\nIt does show this workflow is well fast enough that using my previous decades of experience where I made web stuff \"traditional\" ways was still not easier for me.",

There are still some cool utilities and shortcuts in there though. Animations and effects maybe? I'd love to hear from someone knowledgeable who can elaborate futher.\n\nShort answer: I'm guessing probably habit and convention more than anything. It's still bundled with Wordpress and all the tutorials use it. The frontend de jour isn't as big of a deal in the real world. And in today's age, a 80kb library is actually pretty fucking adorable.\n\nHTMX is 60kb. What can you do with it that you can't with VJS? Nuthin. It's just fun",

We plan to remove support in stages, and the next step will be released in jQuery 5.0.\n\nThey're actually planning to release more major versions, too. Makes sense to drop support for older browsers, but it also kinda feel like that might be a good reason to want to use jQuery, to support complex scripting in retro browsers, as niche as that use case may be.\n\nAnyway, I don't think there's really a good argument for using jQuery for new projects these days. Plain JS does everything you want and it's more or less just as convenient. I do believe that DOM manipulation can still be somewhat complicated and verbose in plain JS, though, and jQuery has a nice set of helper functions for it that are pretty powerful. It's not really worth using it just for that, but this is an area where plain JS has always been a little bit unnecessarily awkward.",

And all that adds up to people extending benefit of the doubt, being predisposed to listen to you, etc.\n\nIn this case, people are much more likely to gracefully take pushback and change tack to work together with you if they think you're a decent guy who's on the level and not out to fuck them.

Politics. \n\nWe can't do everything solo. We need buy-in. How you get that buy-in is Politics. Some people are convinced on purely technical arguments ... but it may not be obvious which arguments they value. Some people are convinced based on simply whether they like you ... so fucking bribe them with a beer once in a while, and smile and nod a lot.

Until you understand the dynamics and politics it's easy to do a faux pas that eats at your credibility early, and it's a PITA to push on your projects if you start with burnt bridges you have to amend.\n* I seriously advice against criticizing a project without offering a better alternative. Hell many times if you can identify the key fix that the project will need and you have the cycles, you can start that and when the project hits the issue, you can come in as the hero with the missing piece. If you don't have an idea of how to fix it yourself, or don't have anything to add then honestly let it go.\n* It also should be considered that many successful projects started as really bad projects that then pivoted as they fixed the core issues and it resulted in something radically different. One thing I've learned as a senior is that sometimes you have to let people do it the wrong way so they can find the right way. This is doubly so when you yourself don't know what the right way is going to be.\n* On the Killing a VP project, $50,000 political credibility cost, I'd up the number to $100,000, it's something you don't want to do, and that many people will never do in their lives. I think that projects on that size are messy, and a lot of times you have a lot of leeway in how you interact with things (make it easy to undo or change back) you can negotiate on that space and it's smaller, and even then there's are many ways to do it without saying the project is a bad idea outright, just having issues on your side. The only reason I think this should be used is if it becomes an existential issue: one that would kill *your* project or the entire company.

Realize what is the implication there. This is talking about projects like that. What I propose is that at that level, it's best to do damage control on your side, and let the project try on its own. If you think there's a better way of doing things that would be effective propose that, or better yet: show it. But that depends on you having enough free enghrs to get the project done.",

Each fab is at least a billion dollars in upfront costs. If the demand for GPU/RAM crashes in the year it takes to get built, it's a net loss for the company. The current capacity is just enough to supply the business market by sacrificing the consumer market, and us consumers will either:\n\n- wait it out\n\n- buy anyways\n\nEither way, it's a win for the manufacturer which will raise prices that will take years to go back down. The only reason the prices would drop sharply would be to have an oversupply, which can't happen because fabs are not getting built.",

Possibly too many. The only valid answers are between zero and two, and 'one' is on thin ice.\n\n> smolid is useful where your peaks are around a thousand new records per second.

I was working at a natural language processing company at that time, and it's relatively common in NLP stuff to download dumps of Wikipedia page texts to use for training purposes, since Wikipedia has a large amount of text in a lot of different languages, and conveniently packages up dumps of all of its content every night. Someone I worked with at the time made a post on Twitter about how this Scots Wikipedia thing exposed a major issue with using Wikipedia (and internet data at large) for these kinds of purposes. The fact that the AI bros are only just realizing this now is pretty funny to me.",

The intent was to give reviewers/maintainers a way to shut down slop PRs quickly and push the burden back on the author to prove the PR is worth reviewing. There is a whole discussion about extractive contributions that may be worth reading to understand the spirit. It still takes time, but we are not at the breaking point where we need further restriction.\n\n\nWe also don't want to wholesale ban LLM-assisted contributions as many active established contributors are pretty happily using these tools. There is a precedent of an optimization discovered by Claude and validated through Alive that was accepted, for example. This is also how we all learn to work with these tools effectively. I expect maintainers and experienced contributors to mentor new contributors on the best practices of LLM usage the same way they would mentor them on using cmake, tablegen or even git. So I don't see a particular risk of there not being a new generation of maintainers: some people will volunteer to put in time and effort regardless of the tooling landscape and some will just send a one-off PR to put \"LLVM contributor\" on their CV.\n\n\nUltimately, we are sort of playing the Turing's imitation game at scale: if a bunch of expert reviewers can't tell the difference, does it matter that a PR is machine-assisted or even generated?\n\n\nDisclaimer: opinions are personal and don't engage any instance of the LLVM project I may be a part of.",

TL;DR: I quantize the components of the sampling (shape) vector to one of 8 possible values and use those to construct a cache key. I then use that to create a lookup table around 2MB in size, which makes lookups very, very cheap.\n\nBut yeah, a lot of effort went into making this run smoothly on mobile. The other primary performance concern is collecting the sampling vectors themselves and performing contrast enhancement, both of which I needed to delegate to the GPU. On my (admittedly powerful) laptop, the full pipeline for rendering a frame takes around 2ms. The [appendix on GPU acceleration](https://alexharri.com/blog/ascii-rendering#appendix-gpu-acceleration) briefly covers this.\n\nBut no plans to implement color for now.

But the root problem isn’t boundaries themselves, it’s a cultural failure to imagine failure modes and communicate integration contracts clearly.\n\nThat’s why treating “boundaries = danger” as the lesson is risky. It can lead to the wrong conclusion: “avoid boundaries, have one team do everything.” That just hides the problem until the system gets too big to hold in one person’s head.\n\nWhat works is being explicit at the boundary: agree on shared terminology (and avoid loaded jargon), surface assumptions, and write down the minimal invariants the integration depends on (units, power source, interface expectations, tolerances, etc.). Working from invariants makes “boring” failures like unit mismatches much harder to miss, because you stop reasoning about what the other engineer surely knows and start reasoning about what must be true for the integration not to fail. That’s why “failure to communicate” is usually “failure to predict edge cases”, especially the stupid, mundane ones we assume would never happen (like pounds vs newtons mismatch).\n\nStarting from invariants moves you from “we missed obvious edge cases” to the much more respectable problem of “we weren’t perfect at predicting genuinely intricate edge cases.”",

There are libraries to provide this sort of functionality, but they're not standard, and they're not ubiquitous and used by every engineer.\n\nIf I'm looking at some metric and I see a field called `latency` of type `double` -- what unit is it? Depending on the system, I have seen seconds, milliseconds, and nanoseconds. Sure, you could call it `latency_ms` -- but why not just have `latency` be of type `duration`?\n\nWhen dealing with currency transactions, you'll usually see one of two things. It's some language-specific form of decimal, or it's an integer value of the smallest denomination. So either $5 == €5 == ¥5 == ₩5 (which is very wrong) or US¢500 == EU¢500 == ¥500 == ₩500 (which is a lot closer but still very wrong). Why not have a first-class currency datatype that allows you to know that $5.00 > $3.00 but will error out if you try to check $5.00 > ¥300 unless you explicitly convert with an exchange rate?\n\nFor that matter, the type system could even deny you the ability to divide a currency value by a scalar, a huge potential source of bugs, and instead offer multiple methods depending on the context. Like splitting an amount into shares, honoring things like rounding rules and minimum coin sizes, so that the results are guaranteed to add up to the original amount and no Superman 3/Office Space chicanery can happen.\n\nAnd the very existence of a first-class currency type in the standard library would discourage inexperienced developers from trying to use floating-point values for currency.",

Which as an IC are basically out of your control. I chased those things as a way to survive the upcoming layoffs, and when I was laid off anyway (along with almost all of my org) it hit me hard. I took that to the next job, and when I came across a bad manager who belittled my contributions while I was trying hard to get influence and impact it broke me. I got laid off again.\n\nNow after some reflections I realise that layoffs happen no matter how hard you try. Attempting to impress people and chase influence and impact is not a worthy goal. Just do the best you can and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nI think the most dangerous thing about performance reviews is that it makes you feel like your compensation and levelling is down to your work quality. As you mentioned in the article, it is more down to politics.",

But perhaps the reward is then promotion (which leads to more money).\n\nIf money and promotion is mainly used as the basis for rewarding performance, is there a way we can avoid a zero sum game? After all, if you shout loud enough at the right people, you can get compensation approved. \n\nI was watching a video the other day, where they talked about how Sales people are compensated. Where you directly tie bonus into the sales you bring in. The nice thing about this is that increasing someone else's bonus wouldn't be reduced by another person's bonus. I wonder if the ideal system would be to somehow justify the value of an engineer's work in terms of money made, and reward based on that. I have no idea if this is possible, seems hard to justify our impact in direct money generation, and engineers frequently help each other out. \n\n\nJust a bunch of rambling thoughts!",

Some are just more open to spending than others. And as soon as a salesperson leaves there is a huge political mess about what to do with their accounts. You might be doing well - you just signed a 500k uplift with a customer and are well on track to hit your number for the year. Then Mike leaves the company and you get one of his accounts. On paper they look good - 2 million ARR, but they emailed Mike before he left that they were planning to spend 1 million less this year, and Mike never updated his Salesforce notes to reflect this.

We have X to distribute in bonuses, Y in raises, and we have A B C D promotions available for the various levels. \n\nStarting at the top of the org chart pyramid and flowing to the bottom, each manager has to decide how to split this pool. Who gets more and who gets less. \n\nCovid times was weird as hell because for a couple years there the budgets really ballooned, especially at a lot of the top tier companies. Then suddenly, cutbacks. Layoffs if you were unlucky. So now managers have to tell employees, you did an amazing job this year, best I can do for you is a shit raise, because the company is tightening its belt. Some people take this in stride, some people quit for more pay elsewhere or politely threaten to do so, some people take this really personally. \n\nIt's also one of the reasons that a team of equal level people can bite you - you have four up from promo but your team gets at most two. What to do? If they're all junior, they need promotions soon else it's an obvious sign to quit; if they're senior they expect longer times between promos and are generally less likely to quit but if they do the impact is more severe. \n\nA company doesn't need to stack rank for comparisons between employees and limited resources afforded by the beancounters and execs to be somewhat painful. \n\nIn ye olde mythical times you could just trust the company management understands all this and will take care of you. Unsure exactly how much that was real vs rosy tinted glasses. Today people get really antsy immediately for good reasons, a missed promo could be a sign of an impending pip/layoff/fire.",

If we just *stopped trying*, for once, things would instantly get better.  There is a large body of scientific and business literature and studies that consistently show the same thing: performance reviews are harmful.  Just stop doing them!  \n\nThe anecdote from your time in Moscow is a case in point: there was no process, but when they discovered someone had been underpaid for 2 years, they gave her backpay.  See?  Already, that's better.  \n\nI'm old enough to have worked at tech companies *before* they started performance review cycles.  It was glorious.  If you wanted a promotion or a raise, you would walk into your manager's office and demand one.  Money was discussed *openly*, with client contracts and sales figures being transparently available to everyone who was working on them.  The way you had \"impact\" was by making sure you worked on the projects with the largest upside while spending the least amount of time on the ones that were underwater.  Very simple.  When negotiating, everything was on the table - salary, vacation days, choice of projects, even all-expense paid trips for your family to join you on business trips.  One year I flew out to Colorado to manage one of their engineering teams for the summer and in exchange I got to live in a mountain cabin with my girlfriend on the company dime - all expenses paid. \n\nThere was only one time when I found that performance reviews were useful: when I didn't have to participate.  I just walked into my manager's office one day and he said, \"good news, you're getting a promotion and a pay raise\".  And even then, that was the *only* good part about it.  As soon as I got to the point where I wanted the next promotion and pay increase that I thought I was due, then suddenly all the bullshit started to matter.  So I had no choice but to quit and get what I wanted from somewhere else.\n\nBut it's been downhill from there. *It is* a wage suppression scheme.",

          "text": "My main lessons with performance reviews is the two key things are,\n\n  \n1. Perceived impact: Not the same as actual impact. Emails that announce your work launching, design documents/reviews, who talks about it are all very important. Two projects that save same amount of money/equal engagement gains will often have very different perceived impact based on how they are communicated. A big part of this is also just focusing your work to align with your manager/skip manager/even higher up as possible.\n\n2. Relationships with people above you: The higher the better. My current company even requires your promotion performance reviews come from people at your target level or higher. You want to promote for senior? Then ideally have multiple staff/senior staff/etc engineers and managers that support you. Having only senior reviewers is technically enough but your chances improve heavily the higher level your support comes from.\n\n\n\nFor 2 one thing I did early on as a junior engineer was \\~2 times a month schedule a casual 1 on 1 with people from teams/departments mine collaborated with to learn more about their work. While that was not done for the purpose of promotion, in retrospect forming a lot of good relationships with senior/staff engineers as a junior helped heavily. I still sometimes do it now (much less though) and now I do consider what level someone is. Just having people high up being aware of your work and include you in future discussions is very helpful.\n\n  \nPart of number 2 is also just the image you end up building. If you are viewed as reliable/fast/etc engineer year 1 then later on if your performance slows down often your earlier image will heavily continue to bias your new reviews and be excused in some way.",

          "text": "I’ve had employers/bosses before use the performance review not so much to review me (and my work) but their general frustrations at the company (and life), and then rate me as a poor performer.  Two cases come to my mind:\n\n1. Early job.  My boss came out of a nasty 4 hour support call, but still needed to give me a year-end review before I went on vacation.  He was not in a good mood.  He spent the next two hours going beyond every detail to nitpick things from my first couple of weeks.  He started complaining about my lunch choices.  He even believed some (obvious) lies from his favorite self-appointed-second-in-command, which was the only time I raised my voice back at him.  I still have some lasting trauma from the place.  Years later I’ve learned about narcissistic abuse only to come to the conclusion that this man was an A+ P.o.S.\n2. Not so early job.  I was working for an unstable company that had three CEOs in the span of 12 months.  Product was not built properly from the start (before my time), but we were making headway.  Halfway through my (good) boss ran off to China and was replaced with a “Rockstar” programmer.  Biggest P.o.S. I ever worked for (like AAA+).  Issues included constantly complaining and belittling others behind their back, constantly yelling/asking me “Why did <person> do this?” When there were things done way before my time.  I also suspect he was having a failing marriage because he was constantly telling me about his wife hates him.  As for my performance review, he used it more as a session to complain about things at the company, and even admitted that he couldn’t accurately rate me but still wanted to give me poor marks.  I did try to confront him about this, but when I spoke up an told him that his review was “not fair an accurate” the first thing he shouted to me was “is this about the bonus”?  When we got the product done (and ready for regulator approval) most of us in product development were laid off, except for him.  I believe management wanted to keep him on to clean software things up.  I later found out that he rage quit the company a few weeks later.  But what’s interesting is that he lists himself as working at the company for 5 months longer than his quit date (didn’t want to make it look like he was only there for 7 months).  Somehow he was able to be “Director of Software Engineering” at two companies, at the same time (I think he was lying).\n\n---\n\nI never said anything at the time because I was afraid of losing my job and that these companies were small and didn’t have an HR department.  Don’t stand for abuse and call it out.  I wish I had a time machine to go back and convince my former self to call these people abusive to their faces in the moment.",

          "text": "I mean it's a challenging notion. The first problem, I'd argue, is that there's no objective or reasonable way to measure individual performance. Because so much of the performance of an individual is respective to transient situations and the team you're in.\n\nSay we have a new staff engineer, they've got chops and history, but the company is in a dire position and they are struggling. If they go to team A they'll be thrown some starter projects but have those changed around. Mostly due to the massive reorgs the company is going due to the dire position. Then they'll be thrown around to different teams that work on disparate situations and struggle with different parts of the infrastructure. Our engineer now has worked on radically different platforms, but has never really spent more than 6 months on any team. After 2 years the engineer has done solid job, but more on a senior, not staff level, so they do badly on reviews. The engineer also now struggles to catch up and get something in.\n\nSay we had the same staff engineer, but this time joined a team B where there was a principal engineer involved. As chaos from the reorg happens, the principal takes the new eng under his wing and with a director, they want to create a \"strike\" team that will focus ~40-60% of their time to a specific goal that is important for the company, even as the reorg happens (this is why the strike team, it's meant to be decoupled from the reorg and therefore have a consistent approach. You are not the strongest engineer the principal could take, but the principal engineer sees that the new eng has the potential they just haven't had the opportunity to gain expertise in an area, and they believe that the staff can totally take over this project once things settle down, and the other engineers, though their expertise with the company and its systems can ramp up more quickly, they also would benefit the teams during the reorg more. So this staff engineer now spends ~9 months on this project, and naturally becomes the lead (he's switched to other projects, but they mostly help with the firefighting, paying down the tech debt from the reorg, and then are moved on to another team). After the whole thing the engineer now has grown confidence in his area and helps create a new team for the project that the strike force handled, and is made the tech lead of this team, as the principal has moved on to other projects. Now during after 2 years they have helped a multitude of teams and gained a lot of networking and wide knowledge, but also have pushed and lead critical systems in the company: exactly what you'd expect of a very solid to strong staff engineer.\n\nThe same engineer, the same company, but the difference was just one person that understood how to get their potential out, and not let circumstances hamper the productivity of that engineer. It can be many other variations: access to a mentor or someone who is willing to sit and teach, a manager who understands how to excite you (or at the very least knows how to express feedback and weakness in an actionable manner), a tech lead that has a similar philosophy on software and things with the team just \"click\", or a mix of all of this, or maybe a team that has just the right mix of meetings to avoid thrashing but keep the eng focused through their ADHD. A good chunk of the effective productivity of an engineer is affected by the people around them. This is why we pay manager and middle management so well, this is why staff+ engineers are all about how they work with others: jobs whose effect is increasing the impact/productivity of ICs are huge benefits.\n\nSo we can measure the productivity at team level relatively well, but it's hard to do it at individual level. Any system that purports to be able to measure this directly on the individual is bound to have parts of it that are arbitrarily defined and hand-waved away based on what is convenient. This gives us different pros and cons. In some companies you lose a lot of amazing engineers because they move elsewhere once they are good enough, because you can't recognize them. In some companies you'd have to lose tens of solid engineers while a team struggles for years before realizing it was a management issue. In some companies there's a lot of people who just have no idea what to do and require an insane unjustifiable investment to become productive enough but you can't justify getting rid of them either.",

              "text": "So how do we track individuals? The answer is complicated, but there is a way. Ironically the easier problem to solve is, IMHO, promotions:\n\n* New grad to Junior: just meet expectations for a couple of years, if you are still in New Grad level and are more than X years after you graduated, this should be a moment to bring up an intervention with possible firing. There's a chance that the training and education you need just can't be given at the company, and extending your time stuck in that fresh-outta-school mentality is going to be far more harmful to your range. A successful intervention should basically finish in the guy getting a promotion to junior. A recommendation to go into other spaces (consulting can be brutal but it's great at teaching and forming solid programmers).\n* Junior to Mid: it's about a checklist of skills. Basically you need to have done X amount of projects, covered X amount of things, used X amount of technologies. Basically you need to do what a solid engineer can do and understand a variety of things beyond \"just coding\". You need to be able to get peers to review you positively (like asking for a recommendation, or a peer review) on those projects and about those skills.\n* Mid to Senior: the full checklist, with some advanced work (e.g. supported software that was long-lived, has worked with legacy code, etc.) that's important for the knowledge. At this point you are considered a strong engineer who can do anything that's expected of an engineer and do it well. You also show you know how to work well on a team and understand how to mentor, lead technical design, etc. As in many tech companies (though that may be changing thanks to AI) this is the level you are expected to eventually get to. If you are unable to get a promotion above this it shouldn't be held above you: projects in the staff+ land are rarer, and proving your performance beyond this level is messy.\n* Senior to Staff: This is where we start actually looking at performance. The goal is to show you can interact in variety of projects, with a variety of teams, and yet in all these environments you show a consistent impact. That is you can notice that teams you join have an increase in productivity and impact consistently, and projects you lead tend to be core part of that. If the effect remains after you leave this may actually be a stronger signal of you being staff level. Basically show this in enough environments that you have to start to consider that it'd be a statistical anomaly that it wasn't something unique to you specifically. With this you prove you have a multiplicative effect, and are a highly useful and powerful engineer to pass around teams, and to start thinking on the level beyond teams.\n* Going to Staff+ positions is just about staff but with even more.. Not just show you work well in different teams, but different problem spaces, different areas of the company, different software, and about how well your leadership and mesh with leadership is. This becomes more like the promotions of VPs and onwards, a more political and subtle thing.\n\nThat's great. So what about performance? First of all lets understand the problem with stack-ranking, and in many companies calibration is really stack-ranking behind the scenes. The idea is that employees over a large enough group should distribute normally, and by having the managers discuss over all of these employees they can rank the employees accordingly. If you really wanted an objective measurable way, you would use perf-packets reviewed by a performance committee of managers who were unrelated to the employees being reviewed. Your manager would be on a pref-committee for other engineers. The perf-packet would be made by the employee and manager and make the arguments and data for it. Like the inputs you give to the Roblox algorithm, but it's a committee of humans, and you can appeal a review with another committee.\n\nBut either way this doesn't solve shit either, because of the core problem the article put forward: there's limited budgets to distribute. And how do you distribute them. While we know that stack ranking doesn't work, no one every discussed why. The answer is simple: we assume a normal curve, but who the hell said that's the case? It could just as well be an exponential curve (it is intuitive that the time an engineer has been at the company follows an exponential distribution, it is also intuitive that amount of time an engineer needs to get to a skill level is also an exponential distribution, does this mean that performance is non-normal? No it might be normal, but the point is to make a reasonable case that maybe it isn't). The second issue is what I've said: we track teams, not members.\n\nSo instead lets measure the performance of teams first. We can do a nice, objective system, where a report of what was done is made, and it's measured by managers unrelated to the team into some value. Now we rank the teams in simple terms: it's meeting the expectation, surpassing them, or failing to reach them. We can compare areas of the companies as well by using a Mann-Whitney U-Test to compare how different products compare in efficiency. This is just an interesting number to see how it compares to the profits of that product, but sometimes your cash-cow isn't what needs the most money (it's resilient and working well) and instead the focus should be on the bleeding edge where you're finding new growth opportunities. This info can be used to measure.",

Yes they're both \"companies\" but if that's the only information you judge on, how accurate can you be?\n\nCloudflare won't aim to shut down other website builders, because they don't make money on that. WordPress, however, has their entire business model dependent on it being \"hard\" to make your own website, and \"hard\" to find a host. Ergo, if they bought up this option, they would be incentived to put it behind a paywall or shut it down.\n\nCloudflare, on the other hand, doesn't make their money by charging to help create a website. They make their money by their pro services required for hosting non-trivial content (i.e. databases, lamdas, etc). And they can recognize that Astro only works because it's not paid (it's market is developers who know how to code, unlike WordPress).\n\nSo, yes, if you take the view that \"muh corporation runs software now\", it's equally as bad if any company runs it. But, if you have a bit of nuance you might realize that actually there are better or worse things that can happen to software.\n\nIf Cloudflare switches up, and tries to close-source this, or charge for currently free features, I would be SHOCKED. And I'd instantly call that out as a bad thing. But, that hasnt happened, doesn't seem like it will happen, and again, would probably be a dumb move.\n\nI don't think you've actually used Cloudflare, and know what I'm trying it say.

Various container scanning solutions will warn me that I'm shipping a copy of perl5-base which is vulnerable to a symlink race when creating temporary directories.\n\nWhile I am sympathetic in principle to not shipping vulnerable components, to remediate this issue, I would need to remove dpkg entirely to remove this base package. This is all in service of solving a CVE that has been outstanding for ten years and that upstream perl does not consider a bug.\n\nIMO, this whole hardened image / container scanning ecosystem is selling you a solution to a nonexistent problem. Hooray, you get to avoid TOCTOU in Perl, with no benefit to your non Perl program. Good luck googling any of the problems you run into with non standard tools.",
