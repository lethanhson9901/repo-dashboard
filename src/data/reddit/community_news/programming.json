(That is, it is more work to write than to read!) ...  \n\n> If, however, prose is LLM-generated, this social contract becomes ripped up: a reader cannot assume that the writer understands their ideas because they might not so much have read the product of the LLM that they tasked to write it.\n\nThe breaking of a social contract is a very accurate way of describing this, in my opinion. LLM usage can go beyond typical rudeness, they create situations with *epic* levels of time wasted by professionals in similar positions to the curl team.\n\n[0] https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0576",

Arguaby, it might have been quicker to use an LLM to rewrite that component from scratch and then integrate it.\n\nThis has three major implications: \n\n(1) vibe coding has a natural limit, when code complexity has increased so much that forward progress on prototypes even with LLM support stalls because every step breaks as much as it adds\n\n(2) the deferred/maintenance cost of LLM supported coding is tremendous, and as so often in software engineering, the immediate measurable (lines of code/progress # of features) doesn't accurately reflect the total cost (surprise bug trail and much larger maintenance costs)\n\n(3) Experienced software engineers controlling and pushing back against poorly orthogonalized changes from LLM agents have major value in development going forward. They provide a way to control the snowballing maintenance costs, but of course that comes at a cost of slower upfront development.",

Cont xt window was still at 25% but even compacting it  didn't work, and a new session tried to either re-refractor already refractored code or make completely insane decision. \n\nI guess it worked fine on my original code but I got problem trying to work on their own.\n\nSpent the next couple of days manually fixing all the dumb decisions the agent made during the 1 day of refactoring.\n\nIssues I had with the code were, in no particular order:\n\n- Non consistent syntax \n\n- Duplicated code (similar to a very junior programmer a lot of copy paste the same 30 line function and change one line  instead of changing the behavior of the one function to accept both cases)\n\n- Questionable architectural decisions (just things that worked, but that you know its going to give you problem in the long run if you do it like that)\n\n- Insanely defensive code ( up to declare a variable with a magic number and then check if it is initialized in the next line)\n\n- Hidden and purposely sneaky errors. (One of the errors i pointed out turns out he fixed it by adding a check at the beginning of the function that basically always returned true in an obfuscated way but didn't actually run)\n\n- Random bugs and small quirks added that only becomes clearer once you actually start to use the program \n\n\nA lot like AI images when you see them you see that they are AI, but you cant put your finger on it. until you start pay attention and you see the 7 fingers and the weird nonsensical stuff in the background.\n\nStill better than Claude 4 was (last one I tried a couple of months before, when everyone was saying that programming is over for humans). But I'll wait for claude 5 next, people say 4.5 is there with Gemini 3, but I dont think is close enough that even if it is slightly better might make me more efficient.\n\nRight now its just slowing me down.\n\nI still use auto completion, always did, I like it because when the code is terrible is a keystroke to delete it and I control the full context and can fix it in the moment instead of having to wait for to go back and tey to understand what the fuck they did.",

But in the most successful tech companies that's not usually the case anymore. There was a really big shift in this about 15 years ago or so when the tech world collectively realized that people with zero science or engineering background tend to make really terrible CEOs when the company specializes in advanced technology. For example, Sundar Pichai of Google is an engineer, im sure he can write a hello world. Jensen Huang is an engineer, Lisa Su of AMD is an engineer, Tim Cook of apple is an engineer, Satya Nadella is an engineer. Even Jeff Bezos has a degree in engineering.",

          "text": "I like AI, I think it can sometimes be brilliant, it handles my \"do git magic to check in well\"  (Repo + branch madness is not something I want to memorize, since EVERY fucking project has their own idea of what \"mainline\"/\"what you should check into\" is... )   \n\nBut anyone who has used AI for a week should know \"It's great when it works, but it goes shit bonkers when it doesn't\"  I spent 3 days trying to figure out how to build something in a proprietary build system... when our main system was built in Yocto... Only problem the proprietary build system won't build the files, And you can't use yocto because you haven't updated the Recipe... I mean that stuff is normal. \n\nSo what does AI want to do? \n\n1. Write fake fucking Project files for EVERY project it wants to pull it, it gave up after 4 (I knew this was a bad idea from 1).\n2. Stub out our analytics code... But I wanted it to create real artifacts to make this code work and be able to be tested.\n3. Compile under X86 instead of the architecture it was needed for.. .ALSO stub out the code... because why not bring back a bad idea for a third round (probably even higher than that). \n4. Rewrite cmake from the ground up so it would work like yocto   (Literally asked it \"Are you serious?\"  And it realized that was a fucking stupid idea... ) \n\nMy point being... it's GREAT when you haven't read the docs, or you don't want to figure out the build system every time, and you need to push something to git.   It's awful when you run into a problem that isn't already documented somewhere else. \n\nSo no... Ai is not Ready to replace Junior Developers, and it's OBVIOUSLY not.   \n\nAnd again I like AI, I think it's a very useful tool, but it's a useful TOOL.  It's the user of the tool that's responsible.   It makes you more effective, it doesn't replace anyone. \n\nBut anyone who thinks otherwise....well either isn't making it do something interesting or novel or unique, or has gotten EXTREMELY lucky and never really tested it outside of that one point.\n\nPS. That story about \"AI figured out what took us 6 months to figure out.\"  I would put SERIOUS heavy money on the fact that ... the AI read their design documents....    \n\nAlso that example?  it created a prototype, if they could only make a prototype in 6 months... that's a bad sign on them.\n\nEdit: Got another story \"Let's use Sqllite instead of Mysql for local dev.\" ... spoiler, a lot of the migration scripts were designed for mysql.. THATS WHY WE DONT CHANGE DATABASES ON A FUCKING WIM.   Oh and it didn't use mysql, it used mariadb... ugh.",

              "text": "Yeah, it wouldn't be terribly hard to build a UDP protocol using OpenSSL with a fast symmetric cipher and a key exchange handshake. If you want to prevent randos from reading your stream that'd probably be fine. Fundamentally you can never really trust the client platform, though. Spending your time trying to build trust into a fundamentally untrustworthy platform will buy you less for your engineering effort than mitigating the possible advantages a user could derive from intercepting that stream.\n\n\nYou can generally assume that given a strong enough financial incentive, people are going to figure out a way to cheat at your game. This isn't just true of video gaming. Casinos are in a never ending arms race and need to mitigate the effects of and detect possible collusion with their staff. See also [Postlegate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stones_Gambling_Hall_cheating_scandal). That one's wild.\n\n\n So your engineering effort is usually better spent mitigating the possible advantages that having access to the streams would confer on the user. Ultima Online had that problem with the introduction of sneaking decades ago -- people would detect you from across the screen and attack you even when you were hidden. They ended up not transmitting hidden players to clients until the server decided the hidden player had been detected. The cheaters could still have faster than human reaction times, but those advantages were not hugely game breaking.\n\n\nIn online poker, even given the best anti-cheat technology in the world someone could still point a camera at a laptop and do image recognition on card faces. So if you want to build a farm of colluding bots, it's not that difficult. An online casino could try to mitigate that by randomizing who you get placed with on a table if they have a big enough pool of players. But if you have a couple dozen (say) systems running bots, you just need to have a couple of them figure out they're sitting at the same table to give yourself an advantage. And that advantage will grow the more bots you have at one table.\n\n\nA few days ago, people were talking about marking their monitor with a sharpie to give themselves an advantage at some FPS or other. Which is why I tend to be suspicious of Esports as a thing unless they're played in a controlled environment with a standardized hardware/software loadout. I suspect part of Blizzard's policy on WoW plug-ins is at least partially an attempt to normalize the environment so that in such a controlled environment a player wouldn't be facing a completely unfamiliar interface. Whenever watching any of the wow streamer channels, their UI looked *nothing* like the stock one Blizzard provided.\n\n\nKnowing all of *that* and being able to convey that information when a user asks about something vaguely related to the ssh protocol being unsuitable as a gaming protocol really highlights the weaknesses in the current round of AIs. At this point the AI has been trained in all of human knowledge, but is incapable of identifying this question as being in the category of \"cheating protection\" and suggesting good places to spend your engineering time to mitigate the impact of cheating. If you follow its advice without thinking about the problem yourself, you might end up building a program that superficially looks pretty secure but doesn't stand up to a thorough analysis by people who have an incentive to do that work. I think the way the world's going now, there will be many opportunities from cheaters because an AI didn't consider lessons learned from the past in its suggested solution. It might be possible to build an AI capable of doing that, but I be it'd be prohibitively expensive to run. Probably more prohibitively expensive than *I* am.",

An AI (likely) has no idea what specific SSH daemon package you have on your local machine, what operating system you're running, or even whether or not you compiled your SSH daemon from source, omitting or including certain additional features. \n\nThey first explain that SSH added keystroke timing obfuscation in 2023. In [the link they posted](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20230829051257) which explains this functionality, it explains exactly how it is implemented and the new ping/pong extension that it uses. Therefore, if someone were to read that post and actually glean technical meaning from it, their next question would be: Is it possible to disable ping/pong SSH extensions on [my specific version of SSH?]\"\n\nIn their case, now knowing that they're using an SSH server implemented in Go, they could have even just searched the server's source code for the extension names (SSH2_MSG_PING, SSH2_MSG_PONG).\n\nBut instead, we can see the next figure in the blog post is the user immediately reverting back to their Claude prompt, asking  the extremely broad question of: \"Is there any way to disable the chaff server-side?\"\n\nI think the lack of explanation of what version of SSH the server running, lack of clarity that they specifically want to disable the new ping/pong extension, and the generic way they referred to the functionality as \"chaff\" demonstrated that despite AI and/or their research leading them directly to the answer, they failed to parse the technical information they were already provided and instead decided to rely on their AI agent to do the job for them and walk them through it.\n\nI was even more taken aback when I saw their screenshot mentioning \"Claude was also pretty pumped\" about their results, with the most obvious \"AI gassing you up and being your yes-man\" response of all time in the screenshot.\n\nI think the overall flow of their problem solving skills demonstrated in the blog post show an over reliance on AI and a lack of critical thinking skills applied to the project.",

By doing so, the author is denying themselves a valuable learning opportunity to try out and familiarize themselves with common networking and analysis tools (tcpdump, wireshark) that they'll likely use for the rest of their career.\n\n(Caveat: It's possible this is a personal skill issue on my part! I'm not denying that someone could write an insane tcpdump one liner to do network analysis - I just don't personally think someone with the skillset to do would ever choose to waste time on scripting that instead of just viewing raw dumped output/using wireshark - but that is also my bias.

I think it's somewhat silly to imply that Google has poor results when looking up technical documentation or information, as it's usually the shortest path to reach the writings of the actual implementers or designers of the thing you're investigating (ie: finding and reading sshd manpages, source code, etc. can all be done easily with Google, regardless of the search engine serving ads or whatever else)\n\nHaving an LLM parse similar manpages for me and try to regurgitate information from it, while obfuscating things like the sshd version, the source of the data, the legitimacy of the data source, etc. just feels like a waste of time. And if I ask an LLM to specify all of that information, I'm essentially just using a search engine again but with more steps.\n\nAI can be useful for providing guidance on generic problems, but it's important to stick to factual documentation and sources of information when dealing with complex technical issues or implementations like SSH. Documentation differs between versions, packages, operating systems, libraries, etc.\n\nAlso, on your point about Google being designed \"to make money for Google\":\n\nGoogle attempts to make a useful product, because if it isn't a useful search engine then users will stop using it. And if there are no users, there will be no one left to look at their ads. In the same way, Claude/ChatGPT/etc. currently attempt to be useful, but just like a Google search, are inherently profit-driven, selling user training data and other analytics. While Google Ads may not be the same profit motivator as captured analytics and training data, both companies make an attempt to be as useful as possible to protect their income stream and user base.",

          "text": "I’ve been working with SharePoint for quite a while and enjoyed reading your post. I noticed a few points that may not be fully accurate or at a minimum I had some thoughts about it, and I wanted to share some clarifications that might be useful for you and others in the community.\n\n>**SharePoint Framework is Still Painful**  \nWant to test a change? Package your web part, deploy it to your SharePoint tenant, refresh the page, and hope it worked. The local workbench barely functions for anything beyond trivial examples because it can’t properly mock SharePoint’s APIs. You end up deploying to a dev tenant constantly, and each deploy takes minutes.\n\nThis is not accurate. There is no need to deploy to the tenant every time you make a change. You can work directly in the page and it will automatically refresh as well, without a need of using the Workbench. You can work directly against the APIs.  \n[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/debug-modern-page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/debug-modern-page)\n\n>**The Object Model is Inconsistent**  \nModel), the JSOM (JavaScript Object Model), and the legacy SOAP services. They don’t have feature parity. Some operations are only available in REST, others only in CSOM. Documentation is scattered and often outdated. You spend half your time trying to figure out which API even supports what your trying to do.\n\nI tend to agree with the frustration here. Documentation is certainly hard to find and much of it is out of sync. The only comment I'd make is that you're sort of comparing Apples to Oranges in the blog post when you compare CSOM to REST. Under the covers CSOM is just calling into the APIs anyway, with the exception of server related things on-premises (which should be a given that it's different). The Object Model exists to abstract away some of the nuances of the underlying APIs, and it's expected that they may function differently.\n\n>**Page Rendering Is Slow**  \nThere’s no efficient bundling or lazy loading. Everything gets loaded upfront, whether you need it or not.  \n....  \nThe “modern” pages in SharePoint Online are supposed to be faster, but they’re still noticeably slower than a well-built static site or SPA. \n\nAgain, another area where I'd agree in some aspects,  but disagree in others. The pages are absolutely slow. SharePoint is a huge platform and it is built on decade old APIs that may not be very performant. However, it's a bit unfair to compare it to a static site. Obviously it would never be as fast a static site. In addition, there's context here that is important, which is the sheer amount of ACL's that need to be validated on any given page in SharePoint. It's a platform built on a complex web of hierarchical permissions and many different aspects of the page have to lookup to ACLs to determine whether a specific user has access to it. It's not just a simple web site.\n\nWith that said, I'd also argue about the efficient bundling and lazy loading. This is implemented in Modern SharePoint, both for different aspects of the page (e.g suite bar) and even within the page sections themselves.\n\n>**List Performance Degrades Quickly**  \nThe list view threshold is 5,000 items by default, and if your query exceeds that, SharePoint just refuses to run it. \n\nFor clarity, if your query *returns* more than 5,000 items then the call fails. You mention having a list with 8,000 items and then queries started timing out so you archived the data. Maybe you were in classic, but nowadays moving your data isn't necessary, you would just need to optimize the queries and using paging to return the data, if custom developed. If you're discussing the native experience, the modern experience handles this fine as long the indexes were created accordingly. I have a list with 1.3 million items in it, that I use for demoing this behavior when I speak at conferences.\n\n**Overall Thoughts**  \nFrankly, I enjoyed the read and hope my post here doesn't come off as critical. SharePoint is beast of an application and your blog highlights a lot of the short comings of the platform, but at the same time explains the biggest issue with SharePoint. When SharePoint is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. At the end of the blog you summarized it nicely. You got a real application to build? Don't build it on SharePoint. Use Azure SQL, Blazor, etc. SharePoint can be a great platform to do what it's meant to do, the moment you start building large applications, transactional systems, heavily relational data, is when it truly starts to fall down.\n\nAt the end of the day you should use a product for what it's meant and not shove a square peg into a round hole. You hit the nail on the head when you said...\n\n>Stop trying to make SharePoint do everything.",

Personally, I do not see much value in pulling all of that information into your own database when SharePoint is already acting as that database for you. It also does not scale well, and with how quickly permissions and files change, the data is likely out of sync by the time you run a report. A report based on inaccurate data is not very useful.\n\nWhat kind of reports do you really need that go down the file level and permissions across an entire tenant in a view. Given the hierarchical nature of the permissions, and permissions down the files, you're talking about a really significant amount of data.\n\nI find that many reports that Businesses want is already available in Microsoft Purview, or available as part of the Microsoft Purview APIs. \n\nIf you truly need to operate at scale, the best option is Graph Data Connect, which is designed specifically for pulling data from Microsoft 365 and Graph in bulk. Otherwise, you're going to be constantly fighting against the throttling limits. Though if that's the route you're going to go, make sure you're using an App Registration, utilizing the Batch APIs to reduce the # of calls... not much else you can do.",

Until you understand the dynamics and politics it's easy to do a faux pas that eats at your credibility early, and it's a PITA to push on your projects if you start with burnt bridges you have to amend.\n* I seriously advice against criticizing a project without offering a better alternative. Hell many times if you can identify the key fix that the project will need and you have the cycles, you can start that and when the project hits the issue, you can come in as the hero with the missing piece. If you don't have an idea of how to fix it yourself, or don't have anything to add then honestly let it go.\n* It also should be considered that many successful projects started as really bad projects that then pivoted as they fixed the core issues and it resulted in something radically different. One thing I've learned as a senior is that sometimes you have to let people do it the wrong way so they can find the right way. This is doubly so when you yourself don't know what the right way is going to be.\n* On the Killing a VP project, $50,000 political credibility cost, I'd up the number to $100,000, it's something you don't want to do, and that many people will never do in their lives. I think that projects on that size are messy, and a lot of times you have a lot of leeway in how you interact with things (make it easy to undo or change back) you can negotiate on that space and it's smaller, and even then there's are many ways to do it without saying the project is a bad idea outright, just having issues on your side. The only reason I think this should be used is if it becomes an existential issue: one that would kill *your* project or the entire company. Basically you use this when getting fired is not the worst case scenario because the alternative was very probably going to be you being without a job.\n    * And this one you certainly need to have a better path/alternative that can be done instead, because you'll have to propose something that the company can do.",

Realize what is the implication there. This is talking about projects like that. What I propose is that at that level, it's best to do damage control on your side, and let the project try on its own.

The issue is, why bother?\n\nIf AI gets good enough to not need force and such to program to the point software developers are not needed at all, looking into it will not matter as you will get laid off either way. If it gets good enough to replace manual coding where software development changes, then you can just learn the updated tools at that point pretty easily. If it does not get good enough, then any time you spent on AI is a waste of time.",

The effort lies not in the mixing of pigments, the understanding of light, or the stroke of the brush, but merely in the utterance of a fashionable incantation.\n\nTheir code is not architected; it is wished into existence, a precarious tower of incantations copied from distant scrolls, held together by hope and the toil of the libraries they do not comprehend. They speak in vagaries of \"energy\" and \"flow,\" mistaking the absence of rigour for the presence of genius, and believe that debugging is a spiritual journey rather than a disciplined exercise in logic.\n\nLet it be known: to manipulate the very logic of machines, to command the silicon with precision, is a pursuit worthy of the title Developer. It is a vocation of structure, of relentless reason, of building with materials one thoroughly understands. What these \"vibe coders\" practice is not development; it is digital dabbling. They are not builders of empires, but mere decorators of rented rooms, blind to the foundations beneath their feet and doomed to bewilderment when the walls—as they inevitably must—begin to crack.\n\nThe court of genuine achievement has no throne for such hollow pretension. They may play at creation, but they reside in the gallery of consumers, mistaking the act of curation for the sweat of genesis. A most tiresome and decadent trend, indeed.",

We have a bunch of UUIDs generated across many services, and every so often I get an error looking like \"a problem happened with whatever, ID \\[blah\\].\" I ended up writing a script to search every cloudwatch group I care about in all regions for that ID at once.\n\nMy understanding of current distributed systems practices is that the *proper* way to do this is to have one central trace ID source and that ID is context-propagated everywhere (so service requests have both a request ID and a global trace ID).\n\n\\---\n\nOverall fun concept and I've def. thought of a similar thing before, I don't think I have a use case for this right now but I love seeing people mess with alt ID systems.

If you want a UUID that is *forever* unique and meaningful and part of an audit trace, over ANY circumstance - massively distributed, surviving company acquisition, refactoring, decades of bit rot, dumped into logs and schemaless backups, passed between data processors and back, then encode the whole lot.\n\nThe UUID is self-contained within a single application? Sure, scale the timestamp over the period between the date of the first git commit to the age you expect to be long dead, and you've saved some CO_2 emissions.\n\n> I’ll just leave that to the PostgreSQL project or ISO/IEC to fix before 2059.\n\nSensible conclusion in most circumstances! As long as you aren't designing infrastructure, my own \"rule of thumb\" is 25 years, so by that metric this isn't a bad decision for another eight years.\n\n> Only 2 bits for versioning?\n\nAbsolutely enough.

When enough people vote for the end of democracy, then so be it. Any political system can be changed to another at the will of those in control of it. Democracy is not any different.\n\nPersonally, I'm a firm believer in democracy, and it makes me sad seeing change to a different system, but then again this project is not controlling anything in our lives, so the point is that people are just trolling with that and see this as entertainment.\n\nIt's a rather long shot to relate this to a political system. In addition voting is often only the most interactive aspect of a democracy. But to reduce a democracy to just voting is a simplification. There are political systems that let people vote, but that's it. A strong political democracy has free press, separation of powers, rule of law, active participation, and fundamental rights and equality *in addition* to voting. A political system where people cannot choose *what to vote on* is not a democracy.",

I was working at a natural language processing company at that time, and it's relatively common in NLP stuff to download dumps of Wikipedia page texts to use for training purposes, since Wikipedia has a large amount of text in a lot of different languages, and conveniently packages up dumps of all of its content every night. Someone I worked with at the time made a post on Twitter about how this Scots Wikipedia thing exposed a major issue with using Wikipedia (and internet data at large) for these kinds of purposes.

          "text": "One important thing that the news article overlooks, admittedly because it is in the details section, is the \"refusal right\" of the reviewer: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/18695b27d565#diff-d2a57bdfbfd05995949fc58d974aea3dba33460e67e10c24555dc640874c6903R115. The intent was to give reviewers/maintainers a way to shut down slop PRs quickly and push the burden back on the author to prove the PR is worth reviewing. There is a whole discussion about extractive contributions that may be worth reading to understand the spirit. It still takes time, but we are not at the breaking point where we need further restriction.\n\n\nWe also don't want to wholesale ban LLM-assisted contributions as many active established contributors are pretty happily using these tools. There is a precedent of an optimization discovered by Claude and validated through Alive that was accepted, for example. This is also how we all learn to work with these tools effectively. I expect maintainers and experienced contributors to mentor new contributors on the best practices of LLM usage the same way they would mentor them on using cmake, tablegen or even git. So I don't see a particular risk of there not being a new generation of maintainers: some people will volunteer to put in time and effort regardless of the tooling landscape and some will just send a one-off PR to put \"LLVM contributor\" on their CV.\n\n\nUltimately, we are sort of playing the Turing's imitation game at scale: if a bunch of expert reviewers can't tell the difference, does it matter that a PR is machine-assisted or even generated?\n\n\nDisclaimer: opinions are personal and don't engage any instance of the LLVM project I may be a part of.",

Which as an IC are basically out of your control. I chased those things as a way to survive the upcoming layoffs, and when I was laid off anyway (along with almost all of my org) it hit me hard. I took that to the next job, and when I came across a bad manager who belittled my contributions while I was trying hard to get influence and impact it broke me. I got laid off again.\n\nNow after some reflections I realise that layoffs happen no matter how hard you try. Attempting to impress people and chase influence and impact is not a worthy goal. Just do the best you can and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nI think the most dangerous thing about performance reviews is that it makes you feel like your compensation and levelling is down to your work quality. As you mentioned in the article, it is more down to politics.",

After all, if you shout loud enough at the right people, you can get compensation approved. \n\nI was watching a video the other day, where they talked about how Sales people are compensated. Where you directly tie bonus into the sales you bring in. The nice thing about this is that increasing someone else's bonus wouldn't be reduced by another person's bonus. I wonder if the ideal system would be to somehow justify the value of an engineer's work in terms of money made, and reward based on that.

Some are just more open to spending than others. And as soon as a salesperson leaves there is a huge political mess about what to do with their accounts. You might be doing well - you just signed a 500k uplift with a customer and are well on track to hit your number for the year. Then Mike leaves the company and you get one of his accounts. On paper they look good - 2 million ARR, but they emailed Mike before he left that they were planning to spend 1 million less this year, and Mike never updated his Salesforce notes to reflect this. You get the account and it’s less than 2 months before the renewal. Suddenly you’re 500k in the hole through no fault of your own.",

              "text": "This is basically the crux of it, I think. \n\nThe execs and number crunchers set budgets for orgs and departments, largely based on company profitability, department profitability (or cost targets), some fudge factors like someone deciding how important it is outside of these basic metrics (like: the security team brings no revenue but let's guess how much they prevent in losses), competitive payscale analysis to prevent too much bleeding, and vibes from investors about how much they should be paying (preferably less.)\n\nThen each department or org has a limited pool for the year. We have X to distribute in bonuses, Y in raises, and we have A B C D promotions available for the various levels. \n\nStarting at the top of the org chart pyramid and flowing to the bottom, each manager has to decide how to split this pool. Who gets more and who gets less. \n\nCovid times was weird as hell because for a couple years there the budgets really ballooned, especially at a lot of the top tier companies. Then suddenly, cutbacks. Layoffs if you were unlucky. So now managers have to tell employees, you did an amazing job this year, best I can do for you is a shit raise, because the company is tightening its belt. Some people take this in stride, some people quit for more pay elsewhere or politely threaten to do so, some people take this really personally. \n\nIt's also one of the reasons that a team of equal level people can bite you - you have four up from promo but your team gets at most two. What to do? If they're all junior, they need promotions soon else it's an obvious sign to quit; if they're senior they expect longer times between promos and are generally less likely to quit but if they do the impact is more severe. \n\nA company doesn't need to stack rank for comparisons between employees and limited resources afforded by the beancounters and execs to be somewhat painful. \n\nIn ye olde mythical times you could just trust the company management understands all this and will take care of you. Unsure exactly how much that was real vs rosy tinted glasses. Today people get really antsy immediately for good reasons, a missed promo could be a sign of an impending pip/layoff/fire.",

          "text": "> compensation teams, HR partners, even senior leaders — genuinely want them to be fair, data-driven, and humane within the budget limits set by company leadership.\n\nHere's the problem, *exactly*: people's economic impact cannot be confined into the budgetary limits imposed by leadership.  You'll find that in the whole of your experience, never once did you witness compensation or promotional criteria actually try to arrive at a very simple truth: what is the current and future financial impact of this person's work.  You'll find that this is severely downplayed even when the financial impact is clear and undeniable.  At large tech companies, it's almost commonplace for people to fix bugs or implement performance optimizations that recover *millions* in lost revenue.  \n\nThe whole performance review process exists *solely* to stop people from talking about money.  Or the most obvious fact about money: that the total compensation is always less than the total benefit.  The compensation budget gets set *in advance*, before the performance review cycle even begins.  It's all a distraction to get workers to squabble over the scraps that had been thrown their way.  It does not and cannot reflect reality.\n\n> Companies are still fundamentally hierarchical. We haven’t found a better way to run them — or at least, we haven’t seriously tried. \n\nOn the contrary!  If we just *stopped trying*, for once, things would instantly get better.  There is a large body of scientific and business literature and studies that consistently show the same thing: performance reviews are harmful.  Just stop doing them!  \n\nThe anecdote from your time in Moscow is a case in point: there was no process, but when they discovered someone had been underpaid for 2 years, they gave her backpay.  See?  Already, that's better.  \n\nI'm old enough to have worked at tech companies *before* they started performance review cycles.  It was glorious.  If you wanted a promotion or a raise, you would walk into your manager's office and demand one.  Money was discussed *openly*, with client contracts and sales figures being transparently available to everyone who was working on them.  The way you had \"impact\" was by making sure you worked on the projects with the largest upside while spending the least amount of time on the ones that were underwater.  Very simple.  When negotiating, everything was on the table - salary, vacation days, choice of projects, even all-expense paid trips for your family to join you on business trips.  One year I flew out to Colorado to manage one of their engineering teams for the summer and in exchange I got to live in a mountain cabin with my girlfriend on the company dime - all expenses paid. \n\nThere was only one time when I found that performance reviews were useful: when I didn't have to participate.  I just walked into my manager's office one day and he said, \"good news, you're getting a promotion and a pay raise\".  And even then, that was the *only* good part about it.  As soon as I got to the point where I wanted the next promotion and pay increase that I thought I was due, then suddenly all the bullshit started to matter.  So I had no choice but to quit and get what I wanted from somewhere else.\n\nBut it's been downhill from there. *It is* a wage suppression scheme.",

Emails that announce your work launching, design documents/reviews, who talks about it are all very important. Two projects that save same amount of money/equal engagement gains will often have very different perceived impact based on how they are communicated. A big part of this is also just focusing your work to align with your manager/skip manager/even higher up as possible.\n\n2. Relationships with people above you: The higher the better. My current company even requires your promotion performance reviews come from people at your target level or higher. You want to promote for senior? Then ideally have multiple staff/senior staff/etc engineers and managers that support you. Having only senior reviewers is technically enough but your chances improve heavily the higher level your support comes from.\n\n\n\nFor 2 one thing I did early on as a junior engineer was \\~2 times a month schedule a casual 1 on 1 with people from teams/departments mine collaborated with to learn more about their work. While that was not done for the purpose of promotion, in retrospect forming a lot of good relationships with senior/staff engineers as a junior helped heavily. I still sometimes do it now (much less though) and now I do consider what level someone is. Just having people high up being aware of your work and include you in future discussions is very helpful.\n\n  \nPart of number 2 is also just the image you end up building. If you are viewed as reliable/fast/etc engineer year 1 then later on if your performance slows down often your earlier image will heavily continue to bias your new reviews and be excused in some way.",

          "text": "I mean it's a challenging notion. The first problem, I'd argue, is that there's no objective or reasonable way to measure individual performance. Because so much of the performance of an individual is respective to transient situations and the team you're in.\n\nSay we have a new staff engineer, they've got chops and history, but the company is in a dire position and they are struggling. If they go to team A they'll be thrown some starter projects but have those changed around. Mostly due to the massive reorgs the company is going due to the dire position. Then they'll be thrown around to different teams that work on disparate situations and struggle with different parts of the infrastructure. Our engineer now has worked on radically different platforms, but has never really spent more than 6 months on any team. After 2 years the engineer has done solid job, but more on a senior, not staff level, so they do badly on reviews. The engineer also now struggles to catch up and get something in.\n\nSay we had the same staff engineer, but this time joined a team B where there was a principal engineer involved. As chaos from the reorg happens, the principal takes the new eng under his wing and with a director, they want to create a \"strike\" team that will focus ~40-60% of their time to a specific goal that is important for the company, even as the reorg happens (this is why the strike team, it's meant to be decoupled from the reorg and therefore have a consistent approach. You are not the strongest engineer the principal could take, but the principal engineer sees that the new eng has the potential they just haven't had the opportunity to gain expertise in an area, and they believe that the staff can totally take over this project once things settle down, and the other engineers, though their expertise with the company and its systems can ramp up more quickly, they also would benefit the teams during the reorg more. So this staff engineer now spends ~9 months on this project, and naturally becomes the lead (he's switched to other projects, but they mostly help with the firefighting, paying down the tech debt from the reorg, and then are moved on to another team). After the whole thing the engineer now has grown confidence in his area and helps create a new team for the project that the strike force handled, and is made the tech lead of this team, as the principal has moved on to other projects. Now during after 2 years they have helped a multitude of teams and gained a lot of networking and wide knowledge, but also have pushed and lead critical systems in the company: exactly what you'd expect of a very solid to strong staff engineer.\n\nThe same engineer, the same company, but the difference was just one person that understood how to get their potential out, and not let circumstances hamper the productivity of that engineer. It can be many other variations: access to a mentor or someone who is willing to sit and teach, a manager who understands how to excite you (or at the very least knows how to express feedback and weakness in an actionable manner), a tech lead that has a similar philosophy on software and things with the team just \"click\", or a mix of all of this, or maybe a team that has just the right mix of meetings to avoid thrashing but keep the eng focused through their ADHD. A good chunk of the effective productivity of an engineer is affected by the people around them. This is why we pay manager and middle management so well, this is why staff+ engineers are all about how they work with others: jobs whose effect is increasing the impact/productivity of ICs are huge benefits.\n\nSo we can measure the productivity at team level relatively well, but it's hard to do it at individual level. Any system that purports to be able to measure this directly on the individual is bound to have parts of it that are arbitrarily defined and hand-waved away based on what is convenient. This gives us different pros and cons. In some companies you lose a lot of amazing engineers because they move elsewhere once they are good enough, because you can't recognize them. In some companies you'd have to lose tens of solid engineers while a team struggles for years before realizing it was a management issue. In some companies there's a lot of people who just have no idea what to do and require an insane unjustifiable investment to become productive enough but you can't justify getting rid of them either.",

              "text": "So how do we track individuals? The answer is complicated, but there is a way. Ironically the easier problem to solve is, IMHO, promotions:\n\n* New grad to Junior: just meet expectations for a couple of years, if you are still in New Grad level and are more than X years after you graduated, this should be a moment to bring up an intervention with possible firing. There's a chance that the training and education you need just can't be given at the company, and extending your time stuck in that fresh-outta-school mentality is going to be far more harmful to your range. A successful intervention should basically finish in the guy getting a promotion to junior. A recommendation to go into other spaces (consulting can be brutal but it's great at teaching and forming solid programmers).\n* Junior to Mid: it's about a checklist of skills. Basically you need to have done X amount of projects, covered X amount of things, used X amount of technologies. Basically you need to do what a solid engineer can do and understand a variety of things beyond \"just coding\". You need to be able to get peers to review you positively (like asking for a recommendation, or a peer review) on those projects and about those skills.\n* Mid to Senior: the full checklist, with some advanced work (e.g. supported software that was long-lived, has worked with legacy code, etc.) that's important for the knowledge. At this point you are considered a strong engineer who can do anything that's expected of an engineer and do it well. You also show you know how to work well on a team and understand how to mentor, lead technical design, etc. As in many tech companies (though that may be changing thanks to AI) this is the level you are expected to eventually get to. If you are unable to get a promotion above this it shouldn't be held above you: projects in the staff+ land are rarer, and proving your performance beyond this level is messy.\n* Senior to Staff: This is where we start actually looking at performance. The goal is to show you can interact in variety of projects, with a variety of teams, and yet in all these environments you show a consistent impact. That is you can notice that teams you join have an increase in productivity and impact consistently, and projects you lead tend to be core part of that. If the effect remains after you leave this may actually be a stronger signal of you being staff level. Basically show this in enough environments that you have to start to consider that it'd be a statistical anomaly that it wasn't something unique to you specifically. With this you prove you have a multiplicative effect, and are a highly useful and powerful engineer to pass around teams, and to start thinking on the level beyond teams.\n* Going to Staff+ positions is just about staff but with even more.. Not just show you work well in different teams, but different problem spaces, different areas of the company, different software, and about how well your leadership and mesh with leadership is. This becomes more like the promotions of VPs and onwards, a more political and subtle thing.\n\nThat's great. So what about performance? First of all lets understand the problem with stack-ranking, and in many companies calibration is really stack-ranking behind the scenes. The idea is that employees over a large enough group should distribute normally, and by having the managers discuss over all of these employees they can rank the employees accordingly. If you really wanted an objective measurable way, you would use perf-packets reviewed by a performance committee of managers who were unrelated to the employees being reviewed. Your manager would be on a pref-committee for other engineers. The perf-packet would be made by the employee and manager and make the arguments and data for it. Like the inputs you give to the Roblox algorithm, but it's a committee of humans, and you can appeal a review with another committee.\n\nBut either way this doesn't solve shit either, because of the core problem the article put forward: there's limited budgets to distribute. And how do you distribute them. While we know that stack ranking doesn't work, no one every discussed why. The answer is simple: we assume a normal curve, but who the hell said that's the case? It could just as well be an exponential curve (it is intuitive that the time an engineer has been at the company follows an exponential distribution, it is also intuitive that amount of time an engineer needs to get to a skill level is also an exponential distribution, does this mean that performance is non-normal? No it might be normal, but the point is to make a reasonable case that maybe it isn't). The second issue is what I've said: we track teams, not members.\n\nSo instead lets measure the performance of teams first. We can do a nice, objective system, where a report of what was done is made, and it's measured by managers unrelated to the team into some value. Now we rank the teams in simple terms: it's meeting the expectation, surpassing them, or failing to reach them. We can compare areas of the companies as well by using a Mann-Whitney U-Test to compare how different products compare in efficiency. This is just an interesting number to see how it compares to the profits of that product, but sometimes your cash-cow isn't what needs the most money (it's resilient and working well) and instead the focus should be on the bleeding edge where you're finding new growth opportunities. This info can be used to measure.",

                  "text": "Now what about bad performance? Well lets start with the individual: when an engineer is working badly within a team, or not satisfying them, they are transferred to a new team, with no information about why they looked for an internal transfer shared with the team (that said they may need to pass the internal interview and all that, and if they fail they lose the job). This isn't spreading bad employees around, it's acknowledging that context and situation may matter. If you fail consistently and have other people not wanting to work with you, then an intervention is set up, with a high chance that it'll result in you losing the job. This might seem expensive, but given how long a mediocre employee can remain in the job, it honestly isn't, and teams have an easier time just asking to trade someone for another person, rather than having to set up the firing. The firing happens at a higher level than your direct EM, it requires that multiple EMs are unhappy with you on their different teams, throughout different moments of the employee's life (so it wasn't just a couple bad days, but months).\n\nWith teams with bad performance a similar thing is done. An intervention is done to understand what is happening with the team. There's an order of magnitude less teams than employees (almost by tautological definition) so more effort can be put at scrutinizing the performance. If the issue seems transient, the team is given a second chance to recover. If the issue seems that the team is oversized or under-sized for the projects it handles (i.e. the team's actually able to do everything it wants super quickly, but there simply isn't that much to do as the product has reached a certain level of maturity where the focus is to keep things stable and do incremental improvements there just aren't that many goals to achieve, or alternatively the team struggles to do most of its goals because it's overwhelmed with work) the headcount is reassessed. If the team seems to have engineering issues, weak engineers are transferred to other teams (as per the bad individual performance test above) and you bring in a staff+ engineer to see if they can help change the team to something better. If the problem seems to be mismanagement, then you handle the EM as you would with a bad individual performance issue above. Of course there may be bigger issues at director level and what not, but these are easy to measure, we can rank multi-team leads by doing U-Test between their teams, without the issues of the above. That said, even there you probably want to run some experiments: strong directors may take on more teams/products, while weaker directors may cede some of their teams, until we reach a level. Ideally directors will need to be able to increase the number of teams to advance up the ladder, as they need to show they have a consistently positive benefit over a large enough group of people.\n\nSo what about strong individuals? They'll get their projects and what not that help them get the promotions and to staff quickly enough. Having a patron would also help getting these projects, that hasn't changed.\n\nAnd I agree with the author here: the goal shouldn't be fairness. It should be humanity + alignment. Alignment is the goal for the company: the whole point is that employees give them the most value for their salary, and the benefit to the employee is that they realize what work they do not need to do and can focus on what will actually get them paid more. Humanity is the necessary part for the process to work with the employees. The answer is to be predictable, transparent and candid on the whole thing. Let employees be able to see a calibration/rating meeting, have things be transparent, and be honest about the strengths and weaknesses. Admit that the goal isn't to be a perfect meritocracy, but to reward employees who do the best they can for the company. Be candid in your feedback on how to improve, and be candid on how to 'cheat' the system (e.g. the easiest way to get a great score is to show you generated $X amount of profit for the company that year, where $X is notably larger than what you cost the company) because it isn't cheating the system: it's aligning with the company values (now those may have their own issue, but that's a separate problem). And be clear that there's limited budgets and they're being distributed among all the employees. Maybe a year the profits are 3x and the budget 2x, but the number of employees is now 5x, let the engineers do the math. Treat your employees as adults and trust that they are big boys who understand that this is a business and a job, not a hobby club. And do this making it clear to the employee that you expect the employees to work for their own best interest within the system, and that you want them to succeed because that means they made you, the employer, succeed as well.\n\nThen listen to the feedback: why do employees not like the system. Why do they find it broken? When does it not reward them for doing what the company wants them to do? When does it punish them for it? What are the issues that employees are having? While the system I have may seem extreme, the idea is that you only need peer reviews while building towards senior promotions, but not for normal perf.\n\nAnd this isn't perfect. Lotta details missing on how to not make this take 40% of your eng-hrs and manager-hrs every year. How to make it easy to understand, etc.",

Two cases come to my mind:\n\n1. Early job.  My boss came out of a nasty 4 hour support call, but still needed to give me a year-end review before I went on vacation.  He was not in a good mood.  He spent the next two hours going beyond every detail to nitpick things from my first couple of weeks.  He started complaining about my lunch choices.  He even believed some (obvious) lies from his favorite self-appointed-second-in-command, which was the only time I raised my voice back at him.  I still have some lasting trauma from the place.  Years later I’ve learned about narcissistic abuse only to come to the conclusion that this man was an A+ P.o.S.\n2. Not so early job.  I was working for an unstable company that had three CEOs in the span of 12 months.  Product was not built properly from the start (before my time), but we were making headway.  Halfway through my (good) boss ran off to China and was replaced with a “Rockstar” programmer.  Biggest P.o.S. I ever worked for (like AAA+).  Issues included constantly complaining and belittling others behind their back, constantly yelling/asking me “Why did <person> do this?” When there were things done way before my time.  I also suspect he was having a failing marriage because he was constantly telling me about his wife hates him.  As for my performance review, he used it more as a session to complain about things at the company, and even admitted that he couldn’t accurately rate me but still wanted to give me poor marks.  I did try to confront him about this, but when I spoke up an told him that his review was “not fair an accurate” the first thing he shouted to me was “is this about the bonus”?  When we got the product done (and ready for regulator approval) most of us in product development were laid off, except for him.  I believe management wanted to keep him on to clean software things up.  I later found out that he rage quit the company a few weeks later.  But what’s interesting is that he lists himself as working at the company for 5 months longer than his quit date (didn’t want to make it look like he was only there for 7 months).  Somehow he was able to be “Director of Software Engineering” at two companies, at the same time (I think he was lying).\n\n---\n\nI never said anything at the time because I was afraid of losing my job and that these companies were small and didn’t have an HR department.  Don’t stand for abuse and call it out.  I wish I had a time machine to go back and convince my former self to call these people abusive to their faces in the moment.",

It can lead to the wrong conclusion: “avoid boundaries, have one team do everything.” That just hides the problem until the system gets too big to hold in one person’s head.\n\nWhat works is being explicit at the boundary: agree on shared terminology (and avoid loaded jargon), surface assumptions, and write down the minimal invariants the integration depends on (units, power source, interface expectations, tolerances, etc.). Working from invariants makes “boring” failures like unit mismatches much harder to miss, because you stop reasoning about what the other engineer surely knows and start reasoning about what must be true for the integration not to fail. That’s why “failure to communicate” is usually “failure to predict edge cases”, especially the stupid, mundane ones we assume would never happen (like pounds vs newtons mismatch).\n\nStarting from invariants moves you from “we missed obvious edge cases” to the much more respectable problem of “we weren’t perfect at predicting genuinely intricate edge cases.”",

There are libraries to provide this sort of functionality, but they're not standard, and they're not ubiquitous and used by every engineer.\n\nIf I'm looking at some metric and I see a field called `latency` of type `double` -- what unit is it? Depending on the system, I have seen seconds, milliseconds, and nanoseconds. Sure, you could call it `latency_ms` -- but why not just have `latency` be of type `duration`?\n\nWhen dealing with currency transactions, you'll usually see one of two things. It's some language-specific form of decimal, or it's an integer value of the smallest denomination. So either $5 == €5 == ¥5 == ₩5 (which is very wrong) or US¢500 == EU¢500 == ¥500 == ₩500 (which is a lot closer but still very wrong). Why not have a first-class currency datatype that allows you to know that $5.00 > $3.00 but will error out if you try to check $5.00 > ¥300 unless you explicitly convert with an exchange rate?\n\nFor that matter, the type system could even deny you the ability to divide a currency value by a scalar, a huge potential source of bugs, and instead offer multiple methods depending on the context. Like splitting an amount into shares, honoring things like rounding rules and minimum coin sizes, so that the results are guaranteed to add up to the original amount and no Superman 3/Office Space chicanery can happen.\n\nAnd the very existence of a first-class currency type in the standard library would discourage inexperienced developers from trying to use floating-point values for currency.",

It can be a little annoying sometimes to use, in the way that being forced to do the right thing is often annoying. But it just prevents a whole family of possible issues at compile time. And of course it makes other things a lot easier since it knows how to combine things that can legally combined, adjusting for units automatically.\n\nDefinitely I'll be attacking quantities and units as well at some point here. That'll be a bit more work, but it doesn't have to be an all-seeing, all-knowing system.",

We had an eng manager for a team who wasn't technical enough to push back on the devs and he lost control of the team. Estimates were wildly inflated and team velocity low. He and half of the team got fired and the team we have now is moving much faster than ever before.",
