(That is, it is more work to write than to read!) ...  \n\n> If, however, prose is LLM-generated, this social contract becomes ripped up: a reader cannot assume that the writer understands their ideas because they might not so much have read the product of the LLM that they tasked to write it.\n\nThe breaking of a social contract is a very accurate way of describing this, in my opinion. LLM usage can go beyond typical rudeness, they create situations with *epic* levels of time wasted by professionals in similar positions to the curl team.\n\n[0] https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0576",

Often by reading existing code, just for the act of reading it, you can find bugs or improvements. Obviously it is a hard sell to tell your boss \"hey we should just read our code\". Refactoring or a rewrite of code is continuation of that reading and understanding, can't refactor what you don't know.\n\n\nHowever, I do find that often re-writes create new bugs because it can very easily mis recreating behavior that was originally a mistake but now other code depends on that incorrect behavior. ",

It's not that I don't care, it's that I only go down the new queue a few times a day. I do remove the things you're talking about, but generally I'm seeing them after they've been up for a few hours. I was traveling over the holidays and pretty busy this weekend and more stuff stayed up than usual, sorry about that.\n\nThe biggest category of posts that I remove is demos (\"I made this\"). After that it's random AI related things that have nothing to do with programming, and after that it's support/forum questions. (That last one may surprise you but if you saw the quality of them you'd understand.) [I wrote more about this here](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chs4ib/the_state_of_the_subreddit_may_2024/) but as you can see it's been some time.\n\nI've really love to get some more mods, but I'm very concerned about finding people that I can trust. Some of the more active users here (which is what reddit's find-a-mod feature uses) are really inappropriate to become mods. I'm not sure what other criteria that I can find to keep it from becoming a drama fest.\n\nI'm not happy with the current situation either, but I'm not sure how to make it better. I'm doing my best. Mods aren't paid by reddit so you're shouting \"I sure wish somebody else would do more free work for my pleasure!\". And honestly I'm with you, I wish there were an easier way to deal with this. But until there is, I'll keep doing my best.",

It doesn't seem to have changed and always goes the same way.

Wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nI also think this is likely exacerbated for many of us by the fact that we probably all to some extent report to MBAs and execs who seem to have the idea that AI can just do all of our jobs. I hear enough (and solve enough of it's issues) at work, I come to this sub hoping for good devs writing cool shit I can look at or read about or have conversations about.

I think there's space for someone to have used it as a tool for transliteration or document creation or as a quick smell test for some questions. \n\nI think people that allow LLMs to put words into their mouths are voluntarily allowing corporations to supplant their voice. I think also that someone using an LLM to transliterate their words from the language they're fluent in to a language they aren't is acceptable. I don't know how to really 100% smell which of the two is happening with enough consistency that it can be a rule that the mods enforce here.\n\nTBH, I think I'm fine with people here pushing back on their own and mods sticking with the more procedural aspects of modding instead of a content-driven approach.",

Here is the rant:\n\n\nIMPORTANT\nAs you may notice, this page and pretty much the entire website were obviously created with the help of AI. I wonder how you could tell? Was it a big \"Written With Claude\" badge on every page? I moved it to the top now (with the help of AI of course) to make it even more obvious. There are a few blogposts that were written by me manually, the old-fashioned way, I hope there will be more in the future, and those have a similar \"Human Written\" badge. This project (not the website), on the other hand, is a very, very different story. It took me more than two years of painstaking and unpaid work in my own free time. A story that, hopefully, I will tell someday. But meanwhile, what would you like me to do? To create a complex documentation website with a bunch of highly technical articles with the help of AI and fake it, to give you an illusion that I also did that manually? Like the half of itnernet is doing at this point? How does that makes any sense? Is that even fair to you? Or maybe to create this website manually, the old-fashioned way, just for you? While working a paid job for a salary, most of you wouldn't even get up in the morning. Would you like me to sing you a song while we're at it? For your personal entertainment? Seriously, get a grip. Do you find this information less valuable because of the way this website was created? I give my best to fix it to keep the information as accurate as possible, and I think it is very accurate at this point. If you find some mistakes, inaccurancies or problems, there is a comment section at the bottom of every page, which I also made with the help of the AI. And I woould very much appreciate if you leave your feedback there. Look, I'm just a guy who likes SQL, that's all. If you don't approve of how this website was constructed and the use of AI tools, I suggest closing this page and never wever coming back. And good riddance. And I would ban your access if I could know how. Thank you for your attention to this matter.",

He would assign tasks/work and give deadlines. I remember multiple times when I was working on a task, I would come to a proverbial fork in the road and a decision about how to approach the problem would come up that I could see affecting future programming work.\n\nI would meet with him, explain the problem and the different ideas I had to approach it and what I thought the downstream effects would be. I was hoping he could either give me an answer on what approach to take (whether it was one that I already presented or a novel one), or a rule of thumb to use, or really just any guidance so I could finish the task.\n\nInstead, he would waffle on the importance and criticality of making the right decision (which was obvious, that’s why I was there asking him instead of just doing what I personally thought was best) and that I should implement both ways and then gather data on how they worked so that I could make a data driven decision. Except 1) I was mostly worried about issues down the road, not immediate issues. I can’t gather data on future theoretical issues, and 2) it takes much longer to implement both solutions and then test them both than to just choose one. And he was the one who gave me the deadlines in the first place so he should know about them. I guess he expected me to crunch and work late to still meet them.\n\nAnyways, in order to preserve my evenings, weekends and sanity, I stopped asking him these types of questions and just went with the solution I thought was best at the time. Because if an issue ever arose that was caused by my design choice earlier, he couldn’t really blame me for not being able to see the future and anticipate the problem since I had justification for why I designed it the way I did.",

People tend to overestimate the importance of most decisions. \n\n\nThe vast majority of software decisions are not critical. After all, it's soft.. You can change it. Decisions aren't permanent. Most of the time, just follow your gut and stick to whatever seems sensible at the time. Spending a bunch of time arguing/contemplating some decision that doesn't matter isn't helping anyone. \n\n\nThe obvious exceptions are when your software has the possibility of affecting peoples physical safety or security, but those are few and far between. The other is when you're making something like a public facing client/api where any decision is hard to undo and you'll have to support it long term once it's out in the wild. Even then, if your protocols are designed in a sensible way, this isn't *too* big of a deal. You just may be stuck living with your bad decision a little longer than you'd like.",

Which can and is totally fine! In the right environment, with the right people. I worked at a place where asking questions got you snide remarks and side eyes and \"omfg can you believe this guy\" and I learned QUICKLY to just shut the fuck up and better be thought the fool than prove it.

Better to take your chances and wing it and get it right/interact with A holes *less*, as opposed to bugging the powers that be even *more* and risking getting let go.\n\nIn my current job, it's all the other way around. I'm well liked, and consulted frequently for my expertise and opinion. They want my help as much as possible, and not knowing is *okay* in this environment. I don't have to survive. So I say \"damn, I have literally no idea... But I'm sure I can figure it out, that's my job after all!\" And with this group, that's seen as a strength. As a positive.\n\nIn the end it's not about avoiding humans. It's about avoiding ass holes.

Asking about high-level module / flows or quick \"does this app can do ???\" are fine.\n\nAlso as senior the answer can be \"you can look at folder / file...\" to \"you can check by ...\" are also fine without directly answering the questions.\n\nWhat isn't fine to ask:\n\n\\* something technical that you can google, like \"how to make http call with fetch\"\n\n\\* \"how it works\" for a very short flow, especially when it's single, isolated function\n\n\\* \"how it works\" for long, complicated function without first trying to debug / learning it\n\nanyway nowadays, I find that a good prompt can give you decent answer to where the code that's responsible to run is.

We figure out that we can't use a simple BigQuery MV for our needs. We figure out the path to a solution which is a bit more complicated, but will work perfectly. We ask if everyone agrees or has ideas of why it might not work. No concerns raised. Even the programmer in question is nodding in approval, which is important because he'll be building this DB and system.\n\nOkay. Decided. We have the plan. Sweet.\n\nThen we start discussing how downstream systems will work with the info, and it's all aligned. Perfect.\n\nOh, Programmer interrupts someone else while they are talking. To ask a question.\n\n\"Where is the information being stored?\"\n\nHuh? We look around. No one knows what he means.\n\n\"So, in order for these downstream systems to use the data, it must be stored somewhere. I know this because I have worked in data for a long time.  You guys are lucky I caught this. Lol. We can't just use data. It has to come from somewhere and then  be stored in order to be queried. We can just use probably BigQuery. That's what I recommend. We should store the data in big query.\"\n\nIt's painful because not only has he not been paying attention this entire meeting, but also the system he works on is BigQuery and ALREADY HAS THE DATA.  We were trying to figure out how to get the data into something that will work for the use cases, which we just discussed and agreed upon. He agreed to it a few minutes ago but he doesn't have any clue what he agreed to.\n\nSo, one by one, he asks the questions which were already discussed in the meeting and the doc outlining the purpose of the meeting and how his own system works.\n\nMultiple hours later, we end up agreeing again to the same system that we had already agreed upon.  The programmer in question agrees to build the system. Again. I offer to create a doc outlining exactly what he agreed to build, if he needs it. He says he doesn't need the doc but would like it anyway, just so others can be on the same page as him. Okay.\n\nI create the doc. It outlines the entire plan we all agreed upon, beginning to end. I give it to programmer. It should take maybe three days. He says it'll take about one. Cool.\n\nThree weeks later, he's done. After heavy pressure from leadership.\n\nFucking A. He ignored the entire doc and created a MV in Big Query that accomplished zero of the use cases and based on the GCP logs, he created the MV one hour after leadership pressured him.\n\nAnd then we have more meetings, and he's asking the exact same questions all over again.",

Occasionally the answer was just \"No reason, I'm just more familiar with this method\", and a couple times it was \"That might actually be a better solution, we should look into it.\"\n\nI was fine with every one of those responses. The problem I've run into on some other teams is that some seniors take personal offense when you question them. But I also came to realize that this is usually because they can't actually answer those questions. As a result, they're usually pretty good at shutting down discussions.\n\nSide note - this is a separate issue from the more systemic issue of people being scared to ask questions because managers interpret questions as incompetence or otherwise use those questions against the person asking them. That's also a common issue, but it affects everyone, not just the juniors.\n\ntl;dr If you want juniors who ask questions, ensure you have seniors who answer them.",

For instance, a controversial or volatile project with a well defined estimate may shield the team from undue pressure or negative performance review in the event the project falters. \n\nI would also add that it’s better to *forecast* than it would be to use the verb “estimate”. Estimating the cost of materials is quantitative and generally fixed but its much harder to estimate service/labor costs. You don’t know what you don’t know, and you often uncover new information in software work that impacts the costs. In software development, this is more analogous to weather forecasting. We can forecast the costs of this software project based on current conditions, but that forecast is always subject to change as new information emerges.",

Bingo bongo you can figure out roughly when an epic will be done.\n\nAnd this plan often falls apart because stories have this horrible habit of spawning 3-4 more stories you didn't know you had to do when you started. Because software work is research and discovery.\n\nI really like the author's quote \"X Y Z would need to all go right, and at least one of those things is bound to take a lot more work than we expect.\" That's to say — unless you educate your PMs, you risk having these silly moments when they remind you that you said you'd be done in two stories five stories ago.\n\nI still like making stories. They help me focus and reveal ways the team might parallelize. They're illustrative and walkable by PMs and engineers alike — but you need to point out which ones (as the author puts it) are the dark forests.",

                  "text": "I never said don’t estimate at all, but instead to call it “forecasting”. It is a better name for it. \n\nBut to answer your question, forecasting gets better the longer you do it and have a history of completed work. New teams and new projects mean you need to start over. Over time, you get a sense of complexity, scope, capacity,  velocity, and team dynamics. \n\nSo on a new team/project, we would start by *guessing*. What feels right, right now? Listen to your gut. \n\nThen after a sprint, retro. What worked, what didn’t, what could we improve? Inspect and adapt. \n\nThe next time you forecast, more becomes clear. \n\n> “We thought that task was going to be hard, but it was easy. Now that that task is done, this is clearly a 1 pointer.” \n\nAlso, if using points and just starting out, I like to ask my team “we need a signal that something is too complex and needs to be broken down further. Let’s figure out how many points a complex task that might take an entire sprint might be.” If using modified fibbonacci with a point system like 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 100, for instance, I find most of my teams will say “I can definitely get an 8 pointer done before the end of sprint, but a 12 is likely too large” for instance. Now if we ever point a task as a 12 or higher, we know its at-risk of carrying over and is likely too complex, this is a signal that we either don’t know enough to solve it yet, or we need to break it down into smaller pieces to maintain consistent delivery.\n\nNext retro:\n> “We thought that task was going to be easy, but it was so hard we couldn’t even get it done in a sprint! That task was probably not a 5, but more like a 12 or 20!!”\n\nAfter a few of these cycles, you suddenly understand so much more about your team and the project. You now know that if you forecast anything larger than a 8, it’s probably not ready. You know now that your team of four engineers has completed on average 30 points of work per sprint, that is your velocity. That is also close to 4 engineers x 8 pts per sprint = 32 points of forecasted velocity, which validates your forecasting. You now know that you can expect a capacity of about 30 pts per sprint. You now likely know more about your project, too. You now can start measuring reliability. \n\nThat’s how I do it in a mature, medium to large organization. I have been working with smaller VC startups lately and for those teams I don’t forecast at all. YAGNI. Don’t add planning and overhead you don’t need, until you need it. \n\nMore tips: experiment. Play around. Every team and project is different, take the opportunity to experiment. Observe. Reflect. Keep what works. Drop what doesn’t. For forecasting Ive used points but also t-shirt sizes instead sometimes. It’s all tools in the toolbox, and you should pick the tools for the job.",

You should always propose the *ideal* system, first, and help your manager understand why building it that way is justified.  Otherwise, you’re leaving your manager high and dry when they actually need to push back on unrealistic demands from above.\n\nTrust isn't just about being easy to work with.

This is one of the not-so-obvious failures by technical folks -- not being transparent about what costs they are signing up for. Or worse, the developer says they are implementing a quick and dirty solution, but hand-wave away the costs by saying it should be easy to fix later. But they don't go into detail about what that cost will be later, when later needs to be, and who the dependencies are for later. And that's ignoring the fact that they are not constantly rebasing the expected cost of later with coming changes that the developer might not be able to foresee. That's one of the things managers actually do for us -- they are constantly rebasing the expected cost with the actual cost. So, more info given to them allows them to do that better.",

It completely ignores basically the whole point of it, which is to give your team the ability to plan, roadmap, and make informed trade offs.

I think in an experienced team, it's often possible to have useful accuracy.\n\n\nAs an example, at my last job we had a bunch of services based on a framework. We stood up a new service a couple of times a year, and we very often added a new feature to an existing service that required the same pattern of work: add a new DB column, add some business logic around it, add some new methods to the API. Even if the exact business feature was quite different each time, the time to completion was straightforward to estimate.\n\n\nAnd estimates are really important. They allow sales and marketing to do their jobs. They also give important leverage to the engineering team (\"we said it would take three months, and it'll take three months. Stop pressuring us to get it done in two, it's not happening.\")\n\n\nAs for the engineering team, the process of estimating is important because it quickly reveals the degree of certainty attached to all the key elements. When you are being asked to commit to a date, that's often the point where you really pore through the requirements and realize: hey, there's something here that I don't even know how to do yet. We often have a tendency to rush in and begin with the easy parts, the fun parts, the flashy parts, and ignore the fuzzy, ugly, poorly understood parts. Where I work, project estimation is often the first place one is empowered to tell management that the requirements are unclear and must be fixed. THAT happens all the time where I currently work.",

The hidden costs need to be made more explicit, maybe even as jokes: \"when this will be done?\", \"tell me first how much you'll pay for maintaining all our for-cycles in the code\". Separate the estimates and reports: when something will be done and when the information about the progress will be available, and make the reports meaningful. To do this use the experience: how does the report and estimate of copying files look like? Nothing, theoretical calculation, hanging on 99% for an hour, saying which files are already copied, specify the number of copied files regardless of their size, specify the size regardless of number of files, say the copy is complete, but it's actually in the cache and might be lost if the device disconnects - plenty of options to consider. The binary-search-like approach and experience actually helps: specify two points \"I'll complete it in 5 minutes\" and \"I'll complete it in 5 years\", both are not realistic, cut the range in half, see which half is more likely contains the realistic estimate, repeat. Negotiation is not forbidden in the estimates: \"we need to complete A in order to retain the customer, their renewal decision is in one month\", \"what if we give them B in two weeks, but A in two months?\". \n\nSir, this is Wendy's.",

Managers have to break down the scope into small enough modules so the engineers can estimate. Things get rough when there is 0 specification apart from 4 sentences from a client and they refuse to pay for discovery and you are competing against 5 other companies trying to get the project. Those kinda projects are really not about your estimates, that's a roll of dice from upper management if they decide to take it.\n\nI can count on one hand how many times I've really fucked estimates (going x2 over budget) and almost all of them was when I was a junior and they were trying to teach me the estimation process.\n\nSadly currently I'm working with people who put x2-3 multipliers themselves then upper management also adds a buffer and the result is that we are twice as expensive as the competition. Surprise, surprise, once I got the task of overlooking estimates and I managed to point out how most of our devs are overestimating by a large margin, we could actually get projects because I'd correct the estimations. I was curious and got permission to not tell the same devs that the actual budget is much smaller yet they managed to finish work 70% of the time within my estimation.\n\nMost of our devs overestimated for 2 reasons: cookie points from the CEO and to slack off at home when calling in sick and \"work\" from home or being remote.\n\nI love remote and I fought multiple times to keep that offer on the table for anyone at the company, but boy, I fucking hate people who will estimate 40 hours for a simple fucking CRUD only so they can finish it in 4 hours or less with AI, then they can jerk off while we are pricing ourselves out of the market.\n\nEDIT: I'd add that what I described is not for corporate jobs or startups with self developed apps.

              "text": "Yeah, it wouldn't be terribly hard to build a UDP protocol using OpenSSL with a fast symmetric cipher and a key exchange handshake. If you want to prevent randos from reading your stream that'd probably be fine. Fundamentally you can never really trust the client platform, though. Spending your time trying to build trust into a fundamentally untrustworthy platform will buy you less for your engineering effort than mitigating the possible advantages a user could derive from intercepting that stream.\n\n\nYou can generally assume that given a strong enough financial incentive, people are going to figure out a way to cheat at your game. This isn't just true of video gaming. Casinos are in a never ending arms race and need to mitigate the effects of and detect possible collusion with their staff. See also [Postlegate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stones_Gambling_Hall_cheating_scandal). That one's wild.\n\n\n So your engineering effort is usually better spent mitigating the possible advantages that having access to the streams would confer on the user. Ultima Online had that problem with the introduction of sneaking decades ago -- people would detect you from across the screen and attack you even when you were hidden. They ended up not transmitting hidden players to clients until the server decided the hidden player had been detected. The cheaters could still have faster than human reaction times, but those advantages were not hugely game breaking.\n\n\nIn online poker, even given the best anti-cheat technology in the world someone could still point a camera at a laptop and do image recognition on card faces. So if you want to build a farm of colluding bots, it's not that difficult. An online casino could try to mitigate that by randomizing who you get placed with on a table if they have a big enough pool of players. But if you have a couple dozen (say) systems running bots, you just need to have a couple of them figure out they're sitting at the same table to give yourself an advantage. And that advantage will grow the more bots you have at one table.\n\n\nA few days ago, people were talking about marking their monitor with a sharpie to give themselves an advantage at some FPS or other. Which is why I tend to be suspicious of Esports as a thing unless they're played in a controlled environment with a standardized hardware/software loadout. I suspect part of Blizzard's policy on WoW plug-ins is at least partially an attempt to normalize the environment so that in such a controlled environment a player wouldn't be facing a completely unfamiliar interface. Whenever watching any of the wow streamer channels, their UI looked *nothing* like the stock one Blizzard provided.\n\n\nKnowing all of *that* and being able to convey that information when a user asks about something vaguely related to the ssh protocol being unsuitable as a gaming protocol really highlights the weaknesses in the current round of AIs. At this point the AI has been trained in all of human knowledge, but is incapable of identifying this question as being in the category of \"cheating protection\" and suggesting good places to spend your engineering time to mitigate the impact of cheating. If you follow its advice without thinking about the problem yourself, you might end up building a program that superficially looks pretty secure but doesn't stand up to a thorough analysis by people who have an incentive to do that work. I think the way the world's going now, there will be many opportunities from cheaters because an AI didn't consider lessons learned from the past in its suggested solution. It might be possible to build an AI capable of doing that, but I be it'd be prohibitively expensive to run. Probably more prohibitively expensive than *I* am.",

An AI (likely) has no idea what specific SSH daemon package you have on your local machine, what operating system you're running, or even whether or not you compiled your SSH daemon from source, omitting or including certain additional features. \n\nThey first explain that SSH added keystroke timing obfuscation in 2023. In [the link they posted](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20230829051257) which explains this functionality, it explains exactly how it is implemented and the new ping/pong extension that it uses. Therefore, if someone were to read that post and actually glean technical meaning from it, their next question would be: Is it possible to disable ping/pong SSH extensions on [my specific version of SSH?]\"\n\nIn their case, now knowing that they're using an SSH server implemented in Go, they could have even just searched the server's source code for the extension names (SSH2_MSG_PING, SSH2_MSG_PONG).\n\nBut instead, we can see the next figure in the blog post is the user immediately reverting back to their Claude prompt, asking  the extremely broad question of: \"Is there any way to disable the chaff server-side?\"\n\nI think the lack of explanation of what version of SSH the server running, lack of clarity that they specifically want to disable the new ping/pong extension, and the generic way they referred to the functionality as \"chaff\" demonstrated that despite AI and/or their research leading them directly to the answer, they failed to parse the technical information they were already provided and instead decided to rely on their AI agent to do the job for them and walk them through it.\n\nI was even more taken aback when I saw their screenshot mentioning \"Claude was also pretty pumped\" about their results, with the most obvious \"AI gassing you up and being your yes-man\" response of all time in the screenshot.\n\nI think the overall flow of their problem solving skills demonstrated in the blog post show an over reliance on AI and a lack of critical thinking skills applied to the project.",

By doing so, the author is denying themselves a valuable learning opportunity to try out and familiarize themselves with common networking and analysis tools (tcpdump, wireshark) that they'll likely use for the rest of their career.\n\n(Caveat: It's possible this is a personal skill issue on my part! I'm not denying that someone could write an insane tcpdump one liner to do network analysis - I just don't personally think someone with the skillset to do would ever choose to waste time on scripting that instead of just viewing raw dumped output/using wireshark - but that is also my bias.

From there you can engage critical thinking skills and read the documentation to understand how the tool works. I think it's somewhat silly to imply that Google has poor results when looking up technical documentation or information, as it's usually the shortest path to reach the writings of the actual implementers or designers of the thing you're investigating (ie: finding and reading sshd manpages, source code, etc. can all be done easily with Google, regardless of the search engine serving ads or whatever else)\n\nHaving an LLM parse similar manpages for me and try to regurgitate information from it, while obfuscating things like the sshd version, the source of the data, the legitimacy of the data source, etc. just feels like a waste of time. And if I ask an LLM to specify all of that information, I'm essentially just using a search engine again but with more steps.\n\nAI can be useful for providing guidance on generic problems, but it's important to stick to factual documentation and sources of information when dealing with complex technical issues or implementations like SSH. Documentation differs between versions, packages, operating systems, libraries, etc.\n\nAlso, on your point about Google being designed \"to make money for Google\":\n\nGoogle attempts to make a useful product, because if it isn't a useful search engine then users will stop using it. And if there are no users, there will be no one left to look at their ads. In the same way, Claude/ChatGPT/etc. currently attempt to be useful, but just like a Google search, are inherently profit-driven, selling user training data and other analytics. While Google Ads may not be the same profit motivator as captured analytics and training data, both companies make an attempt to be as useful as possible to protect their income stream and user base.",

Fedora has 6-month release cycle so you won't be bothered by version upgrades too often and it's not shipping some day-old drivers with bugs in them, but it's still modern enough so that all the new hardware and whatnot works perfectly.\n\n[Ultramarine Linux](https://ultramarine-linux.org/) is another great option, it's new like Cachy but it's 99.9% Fedora so you're basically getting the stability and support from Fedora. What Ultramarine does better is that it comes with some important stuff pre-installed for you, such as NVIDIA drivers and proprietary media codecs.",

My final OMG moment was as I simply installed Steam and was ready to tinker with Proton/Wine but nothing. Just Steam-install my Windows games and play without hassle (not all run, but >90%). Even VR runs good. If they rtun they run better than under Win 11. Also AI, ComfyUI, Ollama all run so good.

              "text": "I've been extensively studying and testing distros for the last few months, here's my current take (still just my opinion of course):\n\n* **Ubuntu** (and more so **Kubuntu**) is a solid distro in itself, but its parent company Canonical is basically the Microsoft of Linux. They have implemented some weird quirks into Ubuntu, most recently snaps (while the rest of the Linux world is committed to flatpak), and they are very much pushing their own agenda over the community's good. I just feel like once you switch away from Microsoft, why move to the next worst thing?\n* **PopOS** is a weird one. Their COSMIC desktop environment is theoretically crazy good and I can't wait to use it for real, but it's just not quite there yet. One or two more years and I will definitely try PopOS on my gaming rig, but for now I can't really recommend it due to it being in an awkward mixed state between old and new systems. Their dev team is fully focused on COSMIC, but it's not usable for most people yet.\n* **Fedora** is what I would recommend for most people's everyday use, specifically the [KDE Plasma](https://www.fedoraproject.org/kde/) version. Gaming, programming, creative work... basically for any desktop use. It's very much like Ubuntu for everyday use, but RedHat has been much more Linux friendly and user friendly than Canonical. Similar to Ubuntu, it has a 6-month release cycle for that sweet spot between stable and modern.\n* **Ultramarine Linux** is a promising new distro that's basically 99% Fedora but more beginner friendly. It has less post-installation hassle with things like media codecs and NVIDIA drivers pre-installed for you. Worth looking at, although I *personally* prefer sticking with the base distro (Fedora) whenever possible. But that's probably because I'm already familiar with it, if you're new to Linux then [Ultramarine](https://ultramarine-linux.org/) might be the best option there is right now.",

Haven't you followed the recent news regarding closing the code for RHEL? All distro based on it had to do some workarounds to resolve this, it hurt the open-source ecosystem a lot.\n\nAnd as much as I wanted to love Fedora, it is simply not as good as Ubuntu if you are on NVIDIA. The constant kernel and GPU driver updates requires the system to rebuild their versions against each other, leading to a lot of breakages. While on Ubuntu you rarely face this since the versions of things are just \"up to date enough\", rarely forcing rebuilds, and therefore, less breakages.\n\nUltimately I would recommend Fedora only for those who Are not using NVIDIA, unfortunately for me, it is not the case. Once I buy a new PC it'll be full AMD though, so I'll go back to Fedora and maybe abandon Ubuntu for good.",

But if we have it at home we're using a home (option 2) flavor so we get stuck with all the reminders that we're only licensing the software from Microsoft.  This is why the last time I bought a laptop for home I got Linux preinstalled (via Dell no doubt).

I set up Headscale and RustDesk for easy remote support (I self-host on a $5/mo VPS that also hosts my personal website) and everyone has been super happy. I'm probably the happiest since if one person notices something is off, I can push out fixes to everyone using Ansible. Saves me a bunch of time.\n\nAs always with Linux, there's a little jank. Chrome didn't correctly associate its windows with the KDE tray icon, [so I helped convince the flatpak maintainers](https://github.com/flathub/com.google.Chrome/pull/483) to [merge a PR that would fix it](https://github.com/flathub/com.google.Chrome/pull/474). Similarly, Dropbox didn't detect the home directory correctly and required a manual workaround, [so I opened an issue and PR to get that fixed, too](https://github.com/flathub/com.dropbox.Client/issues/392). The beauty of open source on display.\n\nOf course there's all sorts of other jank I can't fix myself. Questionable interface decisions in KDE. Some AppStreams randomly don't work in Discover (e.g. Dolphin extensions, so no Dropbox sync indicators!). The software development story in containers is not as straightforward as one would hope and CUDA passthrough is still annoying.\n\nThe biggest headache, however, was installing the proprietary Nvidia drivers on my personal computer. There is no way to exaggerate how insane the process is. On a Secure Boot and/or LUKS-encrypted system, it's not enough to layer the akmod-nvidia and xorg-x11-drv-nvidia-cuda packages, oh no. You must also generate a Machine Owner Key, enroll it, and then generate a small rpm package to shim that key into ostree. Then you have to manually configure dracut to load the drivers early enough for the LUKS prompt, which slows down updates by needing to renegerate the initrd. [Here's a guide I found invaluable](https://github.com/Comprehensive-Wall28/Nvidia-Fedora-Guide).\n\nIf you have a Nvidia GPU, I'd suggest looking at the more batteries-included Project Bluefin distros (Bazzite, Aurora, etc.). Take this with a grain of salt since I haven't tried them myself. For Intel or AMD, I'd recommend using vanilla Fedora for its stronger community and more storied history (i.e. I trust it more).\n\nAll that said, none of us miss Windows in the slightest.",

TL;DR: I really enjoy the workflow so far, especially the idea of keeping my toolchains separate from everything else via distrobox. Of course you don't *need* to be on Bazzite/Aurora/Bluefin to use distrobox, but it really fits the theme of the entire OS well.\n\nOn the other hand, I don't know if I'd just blindly recommend it to other devs. I'd say read up on the idea of atomic/immutable distros first, and if it sounds interesting enough then definitely give it a test drive on a separate drive or partition. I don't think it's too big of a change IMO, but you also can't just blindly `dnf install ruby` or whatever like you'd usually do, either.\n\nFor your regular Joe User that just needs the basics though? I can seriously see this being the future. Updates are dead simple and have almost no chance of completely trashing your system. And on the off chance that it *does* break something, rollbacks are a couple of clicks (or one command) away.",

          "text": "Yeah, somewhere along the way I started having an easier time getting audio working on Linux than on Windows. I haven't had to worry about hardware compatibility in years. I can just boot up a Linux install image and it'll find my network hardware and everything on my system will just work.\n\n\nWell, except the nvidia drivers. I have to add a non-free repo to my debian system and apt install the nvidia-driver. Every once in a while a kernel update will forget to recompile the nvidia kernel modules, so I have to kick those off by hand. That's just the first thing I do now if I run an update and my second monitor isn't working when I reboot, and it always fixes it.\n\n\nI haven't tried my entire steam library yet, but every steam game that I have tried so far just works in Linux, as easily as it would in Windows. A far cry from the Loki Games days where there were 5 or 6 games being manually ported to Linux. I have not ever been able to keep World of Warcraft consistently running on my Linux system. I might be able to get it working until I do a kernel update or Blizzard does a client update. So your mileage may vary if you do a lot of online gaming. But the scene is *very good* right now.",

It's the same reason Android will stick around even though most tech journalists would argue iOS is better (with the exception of iOS26).\n\n>No applications = no useful operating system.\n\nJust look at recent popular macOS applications making native Windows versions afterwards (Raycast, Arc browser, etc.). Although Microsoft has encouraged the development of open source software (Windows Terminal, PowerToys, Aspire etc.)\n\n>Redditors sweating bullets deciding to hit up or down on anti-ai vs anti-microslop.\n\nIt's easier to hit the \"anti-microslop\" since the anti-M$ animosity still exists from older devs. I personally find that thinking to be outdated since there are worse more-powerful gatekeepers today than the MS of the past.",

I know you're really just simplifying, but the history of GUIs is way more involved than that, and some other GUI Desktop OSes are still floating about, if niche.\n\nOkay, Amiga in particular ...isn't doing so hot since the 1990s.... and you mightn't want it as your primary desktop now, but there have been *a bunch* of GUI Desktop OSes and GUI toolkits, some quite \nmainstream outside the USA. The USA was a weird black hole of non-Amiga-usage from the European perspective (especially as Amiga was technically an American-origin home/personal computer, though not an IBM-PC-Compatible (much like Classic Mac wasn't). Well confusing things, you could fit an optional x86-on-a-card to an Amiga, that made it also IBM-PC-Compatible)\n\n*This* is not intended to be exhaustive either, just horizon-broadening...\n\nThere are present-day open source AmigaOS clones  https://www.arosworld.org/infusions/weblinks/weblinks.php?cat_id=4\n\nBeOS, a strongly AmigaOS influenced OS, has present-day open source Haiku clone https://www.haiku-os.org/\n\nThere's also RiscOS (originating on the Acorn Archimedes, like the ARM cpu you might have heard of), which runs to this day as an option on Raspberry Pis today, and was open sourced. Probably doing the best out of the euro big three Amiga/ST/Archie, even though the Archie was a distant 3rd in Europe back in the day. https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads\n\nAtari ST TOS/GEM effectively went open too, and while Amiga people looked down on it at the time, actually toward the end became arguably more powerful than AmigaOS in some ways (being e.g. further along in adding memory protection) https://freemint.github.io/\n\nGEOS became New Deal Office / Geoworks became Breadbox. It actually got somewhat open sourced too https://bluewaysw.github.io/pcgeos/ \n\nClassic-MacOS is really a very different OS to OS X (which is really NeXtStep descendant... Unfortunately Apple dropped the X recently, so I've been calling it Step-MacOS when I need to distinguish), though OS X did include a something of a source-compat api GUI layer (carbon).\n\nPsion [tiny-laptop-like PDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_\\(company\\)#/media/File:2005-04-16_Psion_Serie_5mx_PRO_24MB_beschn_unscharf_scharf.JPG) OS EPOC32 eventually became SymbianOS that became very widely used on (mostly non-US) nearly-smart gsm + java mobile devices for ages just before Android/iOS. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian\n\nThe QNX/Neutrino Photon microGUI again saw mostly embedded/mobile device use but QNX is still about today, and Photon was interesting architecturally https://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/6.4.1/neutrino/sys_arch/photon.html#GRAPHMICROK.  It's the one that did the \"one floppy disk web browser\" gui desktop with web browser demo back in the day. http://toastytech.com/guis/qnxdemo.html\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8kQzKCn7lE .  At one stage QNX was lined up to be the Amiga-branded successor to AmigaOS proper, but that deal collapsed totally. https://www.osnews.com/story/11034/how-qnx-failed-the-amiga/\n\nAnd then over in Japan they had their own stuff, like the GUI desktop for Sharp X68000s SX-Window on the Human68k OS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SX-Window\n\n\n>  There are easily 15 or 20 different window managers to choose from\n\nYes, it is case that the GUI widget toolkits, window managers / desktop environments and display servers (X11, Wayland) can be somewhat decoupled from the OS overall, though that's most common in Unix/Linux/BSD land... it also can apply somewhat elsewhere e.g. AmigaOS had 3rd party Scalos and Directory Opus and 1st party Workbench Desktop Environments, 1st party Intuition and 3rd party MUI and ClassAct GUI toolkits (until ClassAct became part of the OS later as ReAction), and [VMS/OpenVMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS) also ran X11 CDE while being not really a Unix.  (while VMS isn't popular now, it still exists, and famously Microsoft Windows NT (WNT...) is also suspiciously strongly VMS influenced because Cutler - try going to the next letter in the alphabet...).\n\nLinux and the BSDs / Unixes often run the same display servers and GUI toolkits and are architecturally similar generally.  You thus won't have a hugely different desktop experience from Linux on a FreeBSD or DragonflyBSD given a particular GUI Desktop Environment, but they are different OSes.  But you have KDE  (built with Qt), GNOME ( built with Gtk+), XFCE / Gtk+, Enlightenment (EFL/Elementary), etc. etc.",

Because I don’t need high level thinking, what I need is someone to pair with who knows bog standard typescript better than I do, which is a low bar. And the bonus is what it does something flagrantly wrong or non-idiomatic I _generally_ can smell it from a mile away and can at least glean what not to do even from bad sessions. \n\nAll that being said I also get extremely frustrated with the capriciousness and lack of cohesion of the js ecosystem. There are a few shining beacons of logic and reasonable convention but most of the time I am just baffled that it caught on because so much of it is opinionated while also being sectarian so it feels like you have to struggle through a half dozen reinvented wheels, you need to reinvent a half dozen wheels, then maybe you find a workflow that doesn’t result in a bunch of make work wheel spinning. It’s no wonder most models veer in your doing over complex wordy galaxy brained shit, the corpus varies so wildly across all dimensions of quality and cohesiveness.",

A good senior develoepr that cleanly understands how to do all aspects of coding is enhanced by AI because AI can code faster than you for a lot of things. For example, it will blow me out of the water writing unit tests.\n\n2. A junior developer will immediately level up to an intermediate because the AI is already better than them. It knows how to code, it understands a lot of the simpler aspects of coding quite well, and it can simply churn out decent code pretty fast if you're good enough with it.\n\n3. A junior developer will be hard capped in their skill progression by AI. They will become too reliant on it and struggle to understand things on their own. They won't be able to give you answers without the AI nor will they understand when the AI is wrong. And worse, they won't be inquisitive enough to question the AI. They'll run into bugs they have to debug and have no idea what to do, where to start, etc.\n\nI stand by it as my experience in the workplace has shown.

The fact that they found no statistically significant productivity gains *is* the far more interesting finding, but it's not what they were looking for, and it's not the best study design for looking at that. It is of course still surprising that they found no evidence that AI users are faster when the AI knows the library and the people do not.\n\nThe fair comparison would be on a population that's familiar with the library, half with AI, half without. And where they're allowed to use agents rather than just chat, since one would expect that to be faster. And perhaps accounting for what they're able to multitask on while the AI is responding, though I personally suspect that the context switching there doesn't actually lend itself to much efficient multitasking, at least not between high-demand tasks, probably just things like getting a coffee.\n\nBut I think that would still be a largely academic study with little real-world value. I personally would want to compare devs in a large existing codebase that they're familiar with, and include code quality metrics and QA feedback as metrics. That's supposed to be the tradeoff, and so any result other than AI being as slow or slower (a result most people don't expect) doesn't help much, since it doesn't tell you the price you're paying. I expect that to be a difficult study, since I would expect different types of AI use to have vastly different impacts on code quality. For example I suspect that just using GitHub copilot auto complete would have virtually no impact, whereas vibecoding would produce irredeemable trash.",

Full admin system styled by tailwind, standard authentication,  all the shit code was extracted into modular code and rewritten to read better than I could do 12 years ago, etc.  And the site looks identical.\n\n\nThen I tell it to write me a deployment script. 15 minutes.\n\n\nThen my friend is populating content.\n\n\nNot even half a day.

I was shocked at how it did it, but the code wasn't complete; it turned out that most things didn't work. The worst part was the code structure and understanding what was going on where. I think this tool is good for supporting and helping me understand certain things. It works well as a quick syntax check or name suggestion. I also use it for front-end generation because it's always a pain for me; I don't like HTML, JavaScript, and so on. But in my projects, I don't need fancy pages and flashing buttons; I want it to be as simple and readable as possible, so I often dump entire HTML/JS code structures into AI. Unfortunately, search engines like Google are pushing us to AI chats. It's hard to find tutorials for anything specific these days. Besides, I don't think they're being updated, I have that impression. For example, we want a tutorial on creating a login/logout page in Django, and I often find outdated solutions. It's better on YT, but ctrl+c ctrl+v won't work (although apparently no one does that :-) everyone always writes each line themselves :-))",

AI can be great when the person wielding it (a) knows what they're doing on their own anyway, and (b) doesn't trust it absolutely.\n\nBut you know, I'm starting to wonder if that latter part is wrong.\n\nMy thinking... which is ongoing to be clear, I'm not stating a solid position here... is basically to ask the question: when was the last time I reviewed the code that my Java compiler spit out?  When was the last time I went in and tweaked what my C compiler spit out?\n\nAre we treating AI like something more than it needs to be, which in a way is a weird compiler?\n\nPut it this way... if I write some Java code, and compile it, and run it, and it does what I expect, do I care one iota what the bytecode looks like?  Nope, and neither does anyone else.  If I write TypeScript code, and it passes all the tests I wrote for it, do I care what the resultant JavaScript looks like?  Nope, and neither does anyone else.\n\nWell, not until something goes wrong, of course, but I digress :)\n\nMaybe we should be thinking of AI more like a compiler, and our PROMPTS are the source code.  Of course, there's an obvious flaw there: a compiler will spit out the same code from the same source every time (barring version changes or anything like that).  That's definitely not true for an AI.\n\nBut I'm starting to wonder it that really matters?  As long as what I got THIS TIME works, does it matter what  I got LAST time?\n\nAnd what about the argument that AI-generated code is technical debt because eventually you're going to have to touch it yourself.\n\nARE you though?\n\nIf you need a new feature later, you just prompt (and prompt again and again and again and...) until you get what you want.  Oh, there's a bug?  Prompt the AI to fix it.  Oh, it's not quite performant enough?  Prompt the AI to optimize.  As long as the tests still pass, what's the difference?\n\nYour prompts are the source code, the AI is your compiler, whether it's a new feature, a bug, or anything else, why do you care what it actually produces if it works and passes the test?\n\nThis viewpoint bothers me a great deal because it may not be wrong.  Believe me, I've been coding in one form or another for right around 47 years now, professionally for a hair over 30.  And I still enjoy it.  So I don't WANT to NOT code.  But it could it be that \"coding\" is starting to have a different meaning?\n\nMaybe.\n\nAI tends to fall flat on its face if there isn't expertise guiding it.  I've seen people use AI poorly because they don't have the skill to even prompt it properly for what is needed.  You can only go so far with these tools without knowledge and experience to guide it properly.  But man, when you have those things, what you can get out of them IS pretty amazing sometimes... the trick is you have to not look under the covers... and maybe that's okay.\n\nLike I said, it's an evolving thought, and I may well discard it upon further reflection.  But it strikes me as an interesting thought regardless.",

In contrast, LLMs are processing informal language -- there is no spec, there are no regression tests for it. If someone made a compiler that has tons of amazing features that would make life so much easier in theory, but is also full of subtle miscompilation bugs where it simply cannot be trusted that it will do what you told it to, then most people today wouldn't use it. Yes, it is a matter of trust, but there are real reasons behind that trust. You could as well say \"the only difference between actually solving an equation and rolling the dice is trust\".

I think the process described in this article - where you start off impressed, gradually build out a project, and end up in a total mess - is absolutely spot on.\n\nI could decide, like this guy, to not use AI at all, but there's no question I would be slower in certain tasks. But for every task I delegate to it, I'm not really learning (though again, I can't really be dogmatic here because I *do* learn stuff from Claude) and I don't really get to know the system that I'm creating. At work I'm writing in a C++ codebase; I hardly know C++, so AI has written a load of my code. Lo and behold, I shipped a catastrophic C++ bug to production last week (call me names, this is not just my reality; many engineers are doing the same thing). I would *love* for AI to not exist, because then I could really work to become an expert in C++, and it would be understood that this will take time. But because of AI, the assumption is I don't have to do this learning, because an agent can already write the code. So I feel pressured to use AI, even though using it is making me a worse engineer. \n\nIn a way, I think giving up on it entirely is both admirable and sensible. But I worry that if models improve, I'll just end up doing nothing more than raging against the (word-making) machine while others profit from it...",

In real life, design docs and specs are living documents that evolve in a volatile manner through discovery and implementation. ... Not only does an agent not have the ability to evolve a specification over a multi-week period as it builds out its lower components, it also makes decisions upfront that it later doesn’t deviate from\n\nIt's just not true at all. Possibly my favorite part of AI based coding is that I'm constantly telling it to update the spec as new design requirements or decisions are discovered / made. The finished product comes out with a spec and set of requirements that are completely up to date with the final implementation, because they have been updated all the way through.",

          "text": "I’ve been working with SharePoint for quite a while and I noticed a few points that may not be fully accurate or at a minimum I had some thoughts about it, and I wanted to share some clarifications that might be useful for you and others in the community.\n\n>**SharePoint Framework is Still Painful**  \nWant to test a change? Package your web part, deploy it to your SharePoint tenant, refresh the page, and hope it worked. The local workbench barely functions for anything beyond trivial examples because it can’t properly mock SharePoint’s APIs. You end up deploying to a dev tenant constantly, and each deploy takes minutes.\n\nThis is not accurate. There is no need to deploy to the tenant every time you make a change. You can work directly in the page and it will automatically refresh as well, without a need of using the Workbench. You can work directly against the APIs.  \n[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/debug-modern-page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/debug-modern-page)\n\n>**The Object Model is Inconsistent**  \nModel), the JSOM (JavaScript Object Model), and the legacy SOAP services. They don’t have feature parity. Some operations are only available in REST, others only in CSOM. Documentation is scattered and often outdated. You spend half your time trying to figure out which API even supports what your trying to do.\n\nI tend to agree with the frustration here. Documentation is certainly hard to find and much of it is out of sync. The only comment I'd make is that you're sort of comparing Apples to Oranges in the blog post when you compare CSOM to REST. Under the covers CSOM is just calling into the APIs anyway, with the exception of server related things on-premises (which should be a given that it's different). The Object Model exists to abstract away some of the nuances of the underlying APIs, and it's expected that they may function differently.\n\n>**Page Rendering Is Slow**  \nThere’s no efficient bundling or lazy loading. Everything gets loaded upfront, whether you need it or not.  \n....  \nThe “modern” pages in SharePoint Online are supposed to be faster, but they’re still noticeably slower than a well-built static site or SPA. \n\nAgain, another area where I'd agree in some aspects,  but disagree in others. The pages are absolutely slow. SharePoint is a huge platform and it is built on decade old APIs that may not be very performant. However, it's a bit unfair to compare it to a static site. Obviously it would never be as fast a static site. In addition, there's context here that is important, which is the sheer amount of ACL's that need to be validated on any given page in SharePoint. It's a platform built on a complex web of hierarchical permissions and many different aspects of the page have to lookup to ACLs to determine whether a specific user has access to it. It's not just a simple web site.\n\nWith that said, I'd also argue about the efficient bundling and lazy loading. This is implemented in Modern SharePoint, both for different aspects of the page (e.g suite bar) and even within the page sections themselves.\n\n>**List Performance Degrades Quickly**  \nThe list view threshold is 5,000 items by default, and if your query exceeds that, SharePoint just refuses to run it. \n\nFor clarity, if your query *returns* more than 5,000 items then the call fails. You mention having a list with 8,000 items and then queries started timing out so you archived the data. Maybe you were in classic, but nowadays moving your data isn't necessary, you would just need to optimize the queries and using paging to return the data, if custom developed. If you're discussing the native experience, the modern experience handles this fine as long the indexes were created accordingly. I have a list with 1.3 million items in it, that I use for demoing this behavior when I speak at conferences.\n\n**Overall Thoughts**  \nFrankly, it was an interesting read and hope my post here doesn't come off as critical. SharePoint is beast of an application and your blog highlights a lot of the short comings of the platform, but at the same time explains the biggest issue with SharePoint. When SharePoint is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. At the end of the blog you summarized it nicely. You got a real application to build? Don't build it on SharePoint. Use Azure SQL, Blazor, etc. SharePoint can be a great platform to do what it's meant to do, the moment you start building large applications, transactional systems, heavily relational data, is when it truly starts to fall down.\n\nAt the end of the day you should use a product for what it's meant and not shove a square peg into a round hole. You hit the nail on the head when you said...\n\n>Stop trying to make SharePoint do everything.",

Personally, I do not see much value in pulling all of that information into your own database when SharePoint is already acting as that database for you. It also does not scale well, and with how quickly permissions and files change, the data is likely out of sync by the time you run a report. A report based on inaccurate data is not very useful.\n\nWhat kind of reports do you really need that go down the file level and permissions across an entire tenant in a view. Given the hierarchical nature of the permissions, and permissions down the files, you're talking about a really significant amount of data.\n\nI find that many reports that Businesses want is already available in Microsoft Purview, or available as part of the Microsoft Purview APIs. \n\nIf you truly need to operate at scale, the best option is Graph Data Connect, which is designed specifically for pulling data from Microsoft 365 and Graph in bulk. Otherwise, you're going to be constantly fighting against the throttling limits. Though if that's the route you're going to go, make sure you're using an App Registration, utilizing the Batch APIs to reduce the # of calls... not much else you can do.",

We're pretty used to minority coalitions with some support deal in parliament; we haven't had a single party have majority nationally in this millennium. Party membership has been on the decline for a while, but it's still fairly normal to work with someone who's a member of some political party. Which is to say: Political affiliations are protected information (your employer can't make you disclose it), but discussions aren't taboo, and it's pretty expected that people have varying opinions, rather than having to lump everyone into team red vs team blue.\n* We have pretty strong labour rights and unions, and are pretty habituated to the [tripartite cooperation](https://snl.no/trepartssamarbeid) of labour unions, employer unions and the government.\n* We like to think we have a pretty flat hierarchy, where it's expected that you're able to contradict and argue with your boss in meetings.\n* (We also don't really have words like \"sir\" or \"madam\" in our language any more; those fell out of use, oh, around a century ago?)\n\nSo for us I'd kind of expect a labour union like [Tekna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekna_(Norway\\)) or [NITO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Society_of_Engineers_and_Technologists) to be involved in having the backs of employees, but also in informing employees in what's expected to be acceptable and what's not.\n\nThat doesn't mean that everything is sunshine and butterflies, but we might be a bit more predisposed to the idea that employees can and will push back on the stuff their employers want.\n\n> The real question the paper doesn't answer: who's going to pay for quality information if not advertisers?\n\nAt least here in Norway I'd expect tax money to  be a part of the discussion, in a way that'd probably be … somewhat contentious over in Silicon Valley. But over here most of us are onboard with stuff like progressive income taxation and public grants for this and that purpose.\n\nAll this stuff is of course core discussions of politics, which tends to be a no-no on lots of subreddits, including this one.\n\nSo for all the people who want some solution but don't want to discuss politics, uh, good fucking luck.",

I don't know what you really mean when you say \"democratic\" here. On one hand, you might be referring to \"software being for everyone\", but then you are perhaps unwittingly mixing in related concepts that are unrelated to software. What makes something \"unethical software\", exactly? It reads to be very vague and arbitrarily, unfortunately, without specific definitions of what you actually mean.\n\nAnd talking about specifics, I think the only unethical stuff in relation to open-source software is proprietary software, pseudo-open source (think shared source where you can see the code, but aren't allowed to do anything with it), and LLM-generated slop that is currently inundating open source project merge request and issue boards ~ slop that might have been derived from LLMs training on proprietary code, for one.",

We were using the same type and schema for two related things which, up until my most recent ticket, had exactly the same shape. When they suddenly had different requirements the change ended up rippling across way more of the system than intended.\n\nThe approach I’ve outlined for the future is that, when sharing types amongst different usages, it’s essential to determine whether the similarity between the types is a **coincidence** or whether it’s an **invariant**. When it’s an invariant, tight coupling is acceptable. When it’s a coincidence, tight coupling is undesirable. A single snapshot of the system is not usually enough to tell you which of these you are dealing with; these are properties of how systems evolve over time.",

Too often people use them to avoid having to properly model their data. What I tell people is every time you do that, you’re pushing that business logic somewhere deep inside your application code. If you do that 30-40 times suddenly your codebase is a mess that’s impossible to reason about. \n\nDon’t create a data model where num_vertebrae is optional, and if it’s not defined then have some logic deep inside your code to say the animal is an invertebrate.

All updates and deletes had to go through transactions because they affected multiple rows. It was an absolute shit show. I distinctly remember the stored procedures file to manage this mess being bigger than the application that used it. It didn't help that those stored procedures were also really badly written and riddled with commits and rollbacks which made trying to ensure any sort of data integrity impossible.",

It is an indicator of a more denormalized data model. It's slightly more error prone: where the relationship between models and definition of models are not baked into the structure of the data, and instead has to be handled by careful logic in some additional code that you'll have to write somewhere - an additional liability and not a guarantee of reliable data consistency.\n\nIt's a huge pain to maintain, in my experience.",

You could have made a role field and populated it with user and admin flags, but that was too much.\n\nOh what's that?  You need managers which exist somewhere between a user and an admin?  I guess now you have isManager and isAdmin, but is it sensible to have a user which is an admin and *not* a manager?\n\nOr maybe you want to say isCancelled.  Ok.  If things are only ever cancelled or not cancelled, you will not regret this choice.  If you ever allow a thing to become uncanceled as part of a retry state, you will quickly find yourself managing multiple orthogonal fields.\n\nIt's fine say \"keep it simple\" if you are certain that your field exists in exactly two states and that will never, ever chance.\n\nNote that binary methods, which validate if you are in X state or not in X state, are probably fine.  Especially if \"cancelled by user\" and \"cancelled because too many retries\" are multiple states something can be in.\n\nBesides, if you have a state field which only has ACTIVE and CANCELLED, and you never actually go beyond those two states, what exactly do you lose?  A few bytes IF the field is properly packed?  The benefit of simplicity just isn't worth the future cost, IMO.  You don't get that much simplicity, DB field migration is the least fun kind of refactor.\n\nI'm pretty sure you can find \"don't use boolean fields\" articles at *least* twenty years old, for both DB fields and method params, so this is one of those lessons I suspect every generation will learn the hard way.\n\nOf course some, who have jumped from industry to industry, never maintaining their legacy code, will never learn it.",

Aka Stochastic parrot.\n\nThere is no mechanism that allows it to understand what it is doing. Hence the e.g. wrong numbers of fingers problem. These issues can be mitigated but it's more of a brute force approach - do something, check it, redo it, check it, ... Until the check didn't raise any issues.\n\nIs it possible that the parrot can be used to successfully operate a vending machine? It seems so. Can it produce the right decisions for future situations? Sometimes. Can it predict the outcome of something? Sometimes. Does that mean, it can understand what it is doing? No. (See Stochastic parrot)\n\nLLMs are great tools. But it is very important to know their limits.",

Basically *writing* quality code, crafting architecture is a mentally fulfilling activity for many. You envision something, implement it and feel great when the whole thing starts working and always have a sense of learning and accomplishment! I shifted into SWE because I passionately loved coding and how code all works together in some architecture.\n\nOn the other hand, *reading* existing code in order to understand it and find bugs - especially if it's subpar LLM-generated AI slop - is a boring chore compared to the joys of writing it. It's unfulfilling, mentally taxing and it's easy to miss important things.\n\nIt's not fun! I'm often guilty of procrastinating PR reviews. Who *enjoys* reviewing a hundreds line long PR?!\n\nLLMs shift engineering activity away from writing code towards reading code i.e. they take away the fun parts and introduce more of the unfun parts. They also lessen the human discussion and connection part and instead we're mindlessly chatting with a machine all day. \n\nHeck, they even degrade our thinking - at least with web search, we've had to make the final decision about a piece of information or adapt some solution to fit our problem. Now, we're spoon-fed with generative solutions that may or may not work.\n\nI like programming computers but I don't like outsourcing my thinking to probabilistic black boxes and labeling *that* as \"productivity\". I don't like the most fun parts being taken away from this profession.\n\nOf course, many folks just treat code as a means to an end already. They may be good engineers who just don't like coding as much. Or they are managers, CTOs etc. who may have liked coding before but don't have the time for it any more. For them, it's totally understandable that whipping out Claude Code in order to create something between two meetings can be amazingly fun. But not for me!\n\nI'm not sure where all this will go but maybe I need some exit plan out of this profession even though I have achieved quite much. I already barely tolerate the pressure from AI hype, the anxiety that it causes and the burnout that it may bring.",

The effort lies not in the mixing of pigments, the understanding of light, or the stroke of the brush, but merely in the utterance of a fashionable incantation.\n\nTheir code is not architected; it is wished into existence, a precarious tower of incantations copied from distant scrolls, held together by hope and the toil of the libraries they do not comprehend. They speak in vagaries of \"energy\" and \"flow,\" mistaking the absence of rigour for the presence of genius, and believe that debugging is a spiritual journey rather than a disciplined exercise in logic.\n\nLet it be known: to manipulate the very logic of machines, to command the silicon with precision, is a pursuit worthy of the title Developer. It is a vocation of structure, of relentless reason, of building with materials one thoroughly understands. What these \"vibe coders\" practice is not development; it is digital dabbling. They are not builders of empires, but mere decorators of rented rooms, blind to the foundations beneath their feet and doomed to bewilderment when the walls—as they inevitably must—begin to crack.\n\nThe court of genuine achievement has no throne for such hollow pretension. They may play at creation, but they reside in the gallery of consumers, mistaking the act of curation for the sweat of genesis. A most tiresome and decadent trend, indeed.",

Perhaps we could move towards reducing incidental complexity from our systems in a way that would make it possible for mathematical reasoning to scale better.\n\nMy main point is that theorem provers could eliminate the core flaw of llms to be unreliable and hallucinate and that both technologies are only at the start of their development.",

When enough people vote for the end of democracy, then so be it. Any political system can be changed to another at the will of those in control of it. Democracy is not any different.\n\nPersonally, I'm a firm believer in democracy, and it makes me sad seeing change to a different system, but then again this project is not controlling anything in our lives, so the point is that people are just trolling with that and see this as entertainment.\n\nIt's a rather long shot to relate this to a political system. In addition voting is often only the most interactive aspect of a democracy. But to reduce a democracy to just voting is a simplification. There are political systems that let people vote, but that's it. A strong political democracy has free press, separation of powers, rule of law, active participation, and fundamental rights and equality *in addition* to voting. A political system where people cannot choose *what to vote on* is not a democracy.",

They cost a few hundred dollars (back in the day) per seat and were highly profitable. Software companies made money off of other companies' software development. (personally, I bought Turbo C++ for $150 in 1992)\n\nOpen source changed that and most software development tools don't generate revenue (yes, Visual Studio, Oracle's Java, and embedded tools still cost money, but they're the outliers). Sure, I'll pay for a library every now and then, but I always have the choice not to.\n\nNow, imagine the case where you took something that cost everyone nothing but their time and found a way to charge them every time they did it. Not just for the tools or hardware, but every single action generated revenue for you, whether or not it saved them any time or effort. \n\nIt's like if Fender decided to charge me per note I played while offering suggestions for the next riff. Useful for ideation? Probably. Something that should be baked into how I play guitar or I risk getting kicked out of the band? Definitely not.\n\nOr if Intel decided to rent me cycles on their CPUs rather than let me own them... ;)\n\nAI autocomplete and code generation in general is currently a hell of a drug. The first hits are free but there's a possible future where you won't be able to write a line of code without paying an AI tax on it. Do we want that future?",

What's the issue?\" The bigger the company the more efficiently and perversely it will optimise for max Y in unintended ways.  \n  \nThe example that always sticks with me is London in the early 2000s, when the government was under pressure to reduce the abysmal lengths of time people were waiting in A&E (ER) before being triaged/seen by doctors. So they introduced a target: hospitals would be rewarded based on the proportion of people arriving at A&E who were seen, treated and discharged within a four-hour window. The aim being more efficient hospitals and better public opinion. A couple of ways in which hospitals made progress towards the goal that are arguably unintended: \n\n* Cancelling non-urgent operations so that extra staff could work in A&E when performance was being measured (increasing waiting times for elective surgery across the board).\n* Keeping patients just outside A&E in ambulances so that they didn't technically \"arrive\" until the hospital was confident that they could meet the target (leading to increased ambulance response times).\n* A near doubling of the number of patients who happened to be discharged from the hospital within the last 20 minutes of the window.

The metric in that case was the amount of time between when an order was finalized - ie when the cashier collected the money - and when it was cleared off the order screen. This was intended to measure the amount of time it took to fulfill the order, but of course we figured out pretty quickly that nothing stopped us from clearing the order whenever the hell we wanted to.\n\nWas always fun getting praise from the owner when he'd drop by.",

The ones who are mostly immune to this are those that start out with a technical degree (engineering, medical etc.) before getting into business, or have a very high ethical standards.\n\nEvery company I've been thru, I have had experience with new executives stepping in and trying to make their mark by cutting off \"non-essential\" benefits, then dealing with the inevitable turnover of skilled workers by hiring cheap young new graduates or offshoring, and then boom, their career-defining achievement is lowering operating costs by 30+% while coasting on existing revenue. And then after they got their bonuses, they got \"headhunted\" to fuck off out of there before the company loses steam and fail.\n\nAnytime I hear someone mentioning KPI in my field (software engineering), I know it's a red flag. \"Metrics\" or \"indicators\" are fine on their own, but as soon as I hear \"performance\" or \"predictive\" along with them, I know it's 90% chance of being bullshit and what's gonna follow is a bunch of shallow, shortsighted superficial solutions that add more burden to whatever the root cause was.",

Use the infamous google with some advanced keyword operators to find the sites and Reddit to vet their reliability/see feedback from others. Typically ships from India which means a 30 day lead time and cost is $1-3 per dose depending on order size. Shouldn’t be taken daily and every other day is closer to a standard regimen.\n\nObviously do your own research and ONLY do what you are comfortable with.
