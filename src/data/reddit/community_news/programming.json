              "text": "One of the things that finally struck me at my longest job, that I should have seen earlier, was the evolution of perception that leads people to say something happens “all the time”.\n\nWe make the category error of measuring mistakes as ratios or percentage points but the people who are affected by them think only about frequency, and they form their grievances based on statistical clustering about that frequency. \n\nWhich means if a problem happened twice in one week but usually happens on average once a month, it can now be complained about as an “all the time” issue.\n\nIf you make a process or tool more popular, it fails more often, both in frequency and percentage. Frequency should need no explanation at this point. The tool didn’t magically become less error prone. \n\nBut popularity brings in new participants, and encourages existing ones to use it when they are in less amenable headspace - if something’s hard you put it off until you’re having a good day for deep work, and then you do it. But with more confidence comes more bravado, and more chances for human error. \n\nI have a rule of 2 for these sort of initiatives. If you intend to double the usage of a process, you first need to attempt to make it four times as reliable. That way even if it’s used twice as much, you’ll still have a lower frequency of errors. If you didn’t quite hit the4x target, you’ll still settle in somewhere around 2-3 times the usage. If you did manage 4+, then you’re more likely to get around 3x. \n\nWe had a CD process that ran at a tempo. And a hotfix process that was brittle af, but occasionally got used as a poor man’s canary build to test out major architectural changes and tech debt removal. It was only getting used that way about twice per quarter and the tech debt was getting so bad that people were leaving. \n\nI automated all the bookkeeping parts and also shrunk the run book a bunch, often while working on other stuff (like tech debt removal). Eventually we went from using it twice a quarter to twice a week. Which was gratifying but the part I didn’t anticipate is that it got people off the fence on tech debt. All those extra uses were in service of testing riskier changes, often four+ attempts each with long periods of additional work between them. \n\nWhen we were acquired I think this work probably saved us, temporarily. Because then or priorities changes to shifting things like telemetry and auth over to new systems and if you’ve ever pivoted on telemetry, boy can you break a lot of shit, and in ways where you won’t even notice you’ve broken them. I used the ever loving shit out of those tools at that point.",

We had a version 1 and 2 of some code packages and I asked it to find dependencies from the first package and inline them in the second because we were about to delete the first package. I told it we didn't need anything else and when it identified moving code from a v1 to a v2 it just went berserk and did its own thing.\n\nNot only did it inline every bit of code from v1 including pieces v2 did not rely on, it also created a series of adapters to try to build interoperability between them... Which is stupid. These things happened to me named v1 and v2 but they are completely different. And the best part? I made the mistake of not committing first, so when it inlined the entirety of the first package into the second, that polluted the work I did that was all unstaged.

On the other hand, while I still understand the code it writes I don’t have the same muscle memory for where things are in a project. I wouldn’t want to be entering the field right now because unlike my early experience you aren’t going to get paid to learn anymore. Most devs coming up now will probably not be able to work without these tools if they aren’t very disciplined about slow learning through repetition. \n\nIf you’ve tried the high end version of these tools and don’t think it’s going to change our industry you are being naive and myopic.\n\nYou know who cares about software and how it’s written? People like the ones reading this sub. \n\nYou know who doesn’t care in the least as long as it does what they want? 99.9% of the people that use software.\n\nIt doesn’t feel great but it is what it is. The last 15 years of development have become very abstracted.  How much could most devs do without packages that most devs have never read a line of? When you compile something, the code running is not what you wrote its a translated version.\n\nI just see these tools as another layer of abstraction.

          "text": "To pick one of these issues: Shift+enter for multiline input. [Here's the original FR](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/18042). It's actually implemented, so why is this one even open? Probably because [there are plenty of dupes (despite people/bots claiming to have searched)](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/21785), so I'm probably not even doxxing myself by pointing this out.\n\nWhen I asked Claude to solve it, along the way, it tried to reverse-engineer its own binary with `strings` and `hd`.\n\nI suspect what's actually happened is: [They implemented it in a way that works on macOS, only on certain terminals](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16859).\n\nNow, to give them credit, this is the abstraction leaking in some ugly ways. The way terminals send keycodes did not always have a way to differentiate between enter and shift+enter, and in fact, normally they just get a `\\r`, no matter how you hit enter. Eventually, we got [the kitty protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/), which is implemented in most decent terminals (by far not just kitty). This includes a way for apps to enable and disable this protocol on the fly. But I guess that wasn't always the case, because iTerm2 has a checkbox to just turn the program on all the time for everything, which can break things.\n\nAnd I don't know if there was a better way, but... Claude Code's fix is like old-school [UA sniffing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent). If it thinks you're running iTerm2, for example, it'll happily enable this protocol. But if it doesn't recognize your terminal as one that supports those fancy codes, it won't even try... but it'll still *accept* this protocol. (So if you don't mind breaking *everything except Claude Code,* go ahead and check that box in iTerm2!)\n\nAnd this breaks over ssh, because ssh doesn't copy the environment variables it uses to try to detect iTerm2.\n\nBecause by default, ssh only copies `LC_*` variables, and sets `TERM`. But for compatibility, most terminals just set `xterm-256color`. Because if your `TERM` isn't in the terminfo database on whatever machine you're sshing into, you get downgraded to the dumbest of dumb-terminal configs. So if you ever ssh into machines running some ancient version of RHEL that everyone refuses to upgrade, you don't want to set `TERM=alacritty` or `TERM=iTerm.app` or whatever, you just set `xterm-256color`.\n\nBut *some* terminals set other variables. iTerm2 sets `TERM_PROGRAM` and `LC_TERMINAL`. But remember, only the `LC_*` variables were copied over, and Claude Code only checks `TERM_PROGRAM`.\n\nSo now you know how to fix this with a very simple script. If this tool were open source, there'd already be 15 PRs fixing it.\n\nAnd yes, the tool *helped* me track this down. But again: It was gonna use `strings` and `hd`. Who knows, maybe I gave up too soon, maybe I could've come back a few days and a few hundred thousand dollars later and it'd be trying to use Ghidra or something.\n\nMy favorite part of this story is: The slop has lowered my standards so far for what I expect out of a tool that Claude Code was genuinely a breath of  fresh air. That's how terrible the last coding agent we were using was.\n\n(If you're wondering why I'm using any of them, well, my employer mandates them.)",

Just wanted a canvas to draw a height map on to make rudimentary island/country shapes.\n\nIt took about an hour and a half to get a non-functional canvas after frequent back and forth between it spitting out Godot *2*\\-compatible GDScript, misremembering names of functions and variables or just making up new ones toward the end of the script, and error corrections that only caused further problems deeper in. Also it hates giving me copy-paste tabbed code so had to manually adjust every 4-space gap with a proper tab to make anything work.\n\nI'm just gonna learn how to program it myself, as indecipherable as the documentation feels looking at the nodes I think I need, it's probably easier than learning how to wrangle an AI that doesn't listen to \"I'm using Godot 4.6\" at the start.",

(Grace Hopper)\n\nBut seriously, I think he knows that programming is just moving up another level to the world of specs, code review, and setting things up so that agents can make autonomous progress. At least until robots are much more ubiquitous, you still need humans to move stuff around in the real world.\n\nAnything automatically verifiable or with a comprehensive test suite will be AI generatable. That's compilers, server & client implementations for any well defined protocol, integrating with various API's, etc.\n\nMeanwhile, business users still can't verbalize what they want coherently. And, humans still need to be able to review code/systems for many use cases, because AI can't be held accountable for bugs.\n\nSo there is still a role for humans to translate vague requirements into specs for AI to implement. And, to clean up the mess when AI fails.\n\nThere is still a ton of latent demand for software out there. So this just further feeds the Jevons Paradox. And thus there are going to be ***a lot*** of messes to clean up and requirements to translate into specs.\n\nAnd ultimately, that's an amazing outcome. Now a much larger group of customers can have bespoke software built just for them, where it was previously too expensive. That demand can partially be met by a new generation of less technical prompters that can \"build\" this new generation of software with less skill. And due to tsunami of messes that will cause, there's still a role for expert programmers that are competent to review AI code and catch errors.",

They mention at one point that the banks their standards cover are required to be synchronized to within 100 nanoseconds for their transactions. That must have been a fun undertaking to implement at a global scale.\n\n\nThey didn't mention time much at all back in the '80's when I was in college. Given how much of a problem it is, I feel like more attention needed to be devoted to it. I don't know what they teach the kids these days, though.\n\n\nI'd say it's not rocket science, but there are plenty of examples of rocket science being screwed up by bad time handling. One of the engineers at a satellite imagery company I used to work at used to tell a story about how he accidentally  ran some maneuvers from his Linux account instead of the system one they usually used. He had his timezone set to a something other than the GMT one the system used (Just the TZ environment variable in his login info,) and so he ended up rotating the satellite so its solar panels weren't facing the sun. They did manage to fix it, but it took 3 days to get it back to completely normal. The same company couldn't do imaging over the international date line because it would crash processes in the ground system.\n\n\nThere are a lot of take-aways from that story, the main one being that if you're looking for real estate for your fortress of eviltude, right on the international dateline is a good spot to consider.",

Sure, all the above \"assumptions\" are still mitigated, but if all I need to do is provide a timestamp with a disclaimer about its relative precision & accuracy compared to the autonomous platform, that's on the User. My machines do what they're supposed to do, much like how our own heartbeats keep our internal clocks running!\n\n**Disclaimer**: I am in no way refuting OP's contributions.

Our management team told them this was drastic and they we would make sure that nothing happened to their system during those times.\"\n\nI was managing a QA team at the time and I was told that we needed to test it.  The majority of the work had to be done by IT, to set up an environment for us where the clocks wouldn't automatically reset to the correct time.  Once they did that, the testing was trivial: we just set the clock to two hour before the clock change, ran the system for four hours, and verified that nothing bad happened.  \n\nManagement had the team perform this test *eleven* times.  All eleven times, the system ran fine without any problems.  Then they told the development teams to review the entire code base and evaluate every usage of dates and times to make sure that no problem could occur.  The teams all went through their code and concluded that there was nowhere in the code that could be affected by the clock change.  All told, we put several hundred hours into this.\n\nManagement then told the customer that nothing would happen to their system during those times, as long as they shut down production completely on the nights when the clocks were going to change.",

That didn't always mean it was worth your time, as anyone who's fallen for a u/shittymorph post knows, but it was at least more likely than your average typo-ridden run-on CAPSLOCK-ENABLED garbage that showed someone either made zero effort, or had zero education, or both.\n\nAnd if it turned into a debate, at least there was some symmetry of effort. Sure, the Gish Gallop was always a thing, but at a basic level, if I put in some real effort tearing apart some well-presented-but-baseless argument, they'd have to put some effort into their response to at least *appear* to be holding their own. If they immediately descend into name-calling, then it's a lot more obvious that there wasn't much to that initial post. (Maybe it was just copypasta.)\n\nLLMs broke that entirely. They even turned it on its head: Now, the cleaner your syntax and prose, the more that's an indication of a *lack of* effort. From the article, one of the hallmarks of a machine-generated submission is:\n\n> Variables and functions named with an eerie, sterile perfection that no human programmer running on caffeine and zero sleep has ever achieved.\n\nThat's right, code that reads *too clearly* looks low-effort. `foo` and `bar` are the new clean code? ...well, no, not really. Proper spelling and grammar are still expected. But the lowest-effort slop looks a lot more like the highest-effort, highest-quality code (or prose).\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, like you see all over this thread, plenty of actually-good people are starting to use LLMs for at least *some* of what they're doing, whether they want to or not. My employer mandates Claude Code.\n\nThat's why this sucks so much for these maintainers: It's not just the sheer volume of extra stuff to review, it's that all the normal ways of filtering low-effort submissions have stopped working.",

It takes much longer to recognize that they are bad because:\n\n1. They are usually longer, because LLMs have no issue generating walls of text.\n2. If you ask the \"author\" to change something, they'll just feed your comments to the LLM - which will see it as an opportunity to other things, not just what you asked to change. So you have to read everything again.\n3. LLMs are really good at disguising how bad their output is.\n\nI want to focus on that last point. Neural networks can get very very good at what you train them to do, but the ones that became a synonym with \"AI\" are the ones that are easy for the end user to use because they were trained at the art of conversation - the Large Language Models.\n\nWhen you learn a language from reading text in it, you also gain some knowledge about the subject of that text. And thus, when learning language, the LLMs also learned various things. With the vast resources invested in training them, these \"various things\" added up to a very impressive curriculum. But the central focus of the GPT algorithm is still learning how to talk - so with more training this ability will grow faster than any other ability.\n\nThis means that if the relevant \"professional training\" of the LLM fails to provide a correct answer to your request - a smooth talk training, orders of magnitude more advanced, kicks in and uses the sum of compute power capitalism could muster to coax you into believing whatever nonsense the machine came up with instead.\n\nA human programmer that sends you a bad PR is probably not a world class conman.

Mistakes aren't just bugs, they can also be bad decisions like UX, or misunderstanding requirements. Taking critical thinking out of the earliest part of the process may be offset by pushing bug discovery to later, where it's more expensive.\n* We spend 80% of our dev time on maintenance, not the initial creation.\n* Even when creating and maintaining, code review and coming to agreement is typically the bottleneck, moreso than writing the code.\n\nWhere the LLMs can help us iterate faster, we do get an improvement. Or, as many have said, proof-of-concept code, or code that is highly memorization-based or heavy on boilerplate (like CI/CD pipelines), or places where we need something but we don't need to care about quality. It has a place in the toolbelt. Maybe they solve the \"junior engineer\" problem - but in a way that cuts off a pathway for juniors to become seniors, punting a now problem to be a future problem.\n\nIn fact, re: bullet #3 and the code review pipeline being the bottleneck - we are seeing open source projects start to turn off accepting PRs because LLMs can generate at a volume that cannot be sustained by review. That is in fact *exacerbating* our problems, not solving them.\n\nAnd I don't think LLMs will be a panacea for code review, either. I do not believe that LLMs have found a hack or cheat that gets around Rice's theorem. There's still no evidence that we'll get above 90% confidence without spending *so much* energy that profit for the AI providers is impossible. Eventually, their investors will demand that they get to profitability.",

Unfortunately, the clients are all very busy and can't/won't/don't devote enough time to validating and approving items, so I often find myself twiddling my thumbs. And when I do have an item, I have to spend days waiting for them to answer my question(s) about implementation details because, surprise!, they didn't give us good requirements.",

Every dev has faced the situation where starting over and rewriting from scratch was needed and suddenly a piece of software you had spent maybe six months to a year working on you recreate in a few days. Well that's the part of your time that was spent typing in the code. All the rest of the time was the time spent solving all the problems, iterating on the design, refining the logic and generally dog fooding the product to find out what did or didn't work.\n\nThe worry I have is that a tool that can rapidly recreate someone else's hard work is still highly problematic. That the likes of Meta sees a future where instead of having to buy the next WhatsApp they just have a single dev direct an AI to make a clone as soon as the competitor starts to get off the ground and use their existing dominant market position to squelch out the competition far quicker than they could now if they had to spend time and effort to make a competing product.",

Even something as simple as adding an empty stub for a new route, and then empty stubs for the tests, can save 20 minutes. The next ticket can be just a DB migration to add a table. The next ticket can be to add an insert to that for the DB layer. The next is some verification … and so on.\n\nThe point being individually these is really simple.

I'm reminded of this passage from *The Mythical Man-Month*:\n\n> Intercommunication is worse. If each part of the task must be separately coordinated with each other part, the effort increases as n(n-1)/2. Three workers require three times as much pairwise intercommunication as two; four require six times as much as two. If, moreover, there need to be conferences among the three, four, etc., workers to resolve things jointly, matters get worse yet. The added effort of communicating may fully counteract the division of the original task and bring us to the situation of Fig 2.4.\n\n> Since software construction is inherently a systems effort -- an exercise in complex interrelationships -- communication effort is great, and it quickly dominates the decrease in individual task time brought about by partitioning. Adding more men then lengthens, not shortens, the schedule.\n\nWhile this was written more than 50 years ago, and was written in the context about how adding more people to a late project makes it later, the highlighting of the impact of communication applies more broadly in software development and still rings true today.",

At a different periodicity, changes are integrated down the tree from the root to the nodes. In Windows, the node I was working on was 4 levels removed from the root. The periodicity of integration decayed exponentially and unpredictably as you approached the root so it ended up that it took between 1 and 3 months for my code to get to the root node, and some multiple of that for it to reach the other nodes. It should be noted too that the only common ancestor that my team, the shell team, and the kernel team shared was the root.\n>\n> ...\n> The end result of all this is what finally shipped: the lowest common denominator, the simplest and least controversial option.",

Think of a recent significant project or piece of work your team completed (ideally over a period of months). How long did it take, end to end, inception to delivery? Now imagine you were to do the same project over again, with the same team, the same organizational constraints, the same everything, except your team would already know everything they learned during the project. How long would it take you the second time, all the way through? Stop now and try it.  \n> It turned out answers in the order of 1/2 to 1/4 the time to repeat the project were not uncommon. This led to the conclusion that “Learning is the constraint”.",

Package registries are getting flooded with low-effort packages that wrap existing functionality with AI-generated code and AI-generated READMEs. Makes it harder to find the actually maintained stuff. npm already had this problem before AI, but it's definitely accelerating.\n\nThe maintainer burnout angle is worth watching too. If people start submitting AI-generated PRs to real projects that look reasonable but have subtle issues, that's more review burden on already-stretched maintainers. Some projects are already seeing this.",

Much like we were told nuclear was a threat .. but eventually we embraced nuclear energy to offset other energy forms because of the density; IMHO vibe coding is in the same vein.  There will be adjustments and we're all gonna have to get used to that model of development.  \n\nCompanies that *provide* software have a more threatened model IMHO because many things they could write that others couldn't .. can now be written.  So say licensing a tool that does $foo costs many 10K .. and yet you can ask an AI to write the same software and get an 80/20 result with even mediocre ROI is impressive .. and that's only gonna get better.\n\nI think as we continue to explore what it means to have an OSS tool that you've maintained over the years.. and now others can make changes to on their own time w/o having to involve the maintainers ... it will change the paradigm.   \n\nConsider i have too $bar that does this Thing(tm) .. but doesn't exactly solve my problem; and there's resistance to the implementation of the solution.  I can take some $$ and an AI and say \"go add $feature to $bar for my needs\".  The result may or may not be production ready, fit the original design model or have the support the original did; but it satisfies a need that wouldn't have been possible before. \n\nPromoting *any* product is going to have to evolve to talk about WHY their version is better than what can be coded upon or around it.  That selling point will have to be cogent and impactful; and AFAICS I havn't heard one that will be either for MBMA managers that read about the new AI revolution. \n\nIMHO the wins for any software provider will be:\n\n * managing complexity across the entire toolset ( as AI suffers here still ) \n * supportability and responsiveness to issues \n * training and good knowledge transfer \n * feature management relative to design goals\n\nAs examples.

              "text": "The article is written in three steps: 1) senior engineers never learned to mentor and because they're so swamped they substitute good mentorship with, \"how's it going?\", 2) when an engineer gets past that point and try to be a good mentor and listen, typically they mire themselves in explaining technical concepts and deciding between X and Y for a specific problem (you might called this the \"giving a fish rather than teaching to fish\" concept), then 3) there is a blind area where a mentee just doesn't see the things they need to see to ask about like \"how do I deal with an ambiguous problem or effectively scope and estimate a task?\"\n\nThe point is that mentorship is about teaching how to deal with the complexities of problem solving in engineering outside of basic technical principles. I've seen this over and over in all these senior- / staff-level interviews I do; people don't know how to think about problems and system design effectively. Presented with an ambiguous problem or badly stated problem, they're always grasping for a solution they've already seen and it's blatantly obvious. Even amongst people who clearly have had to design a complex solution to a hard problem, lead a project, and have 8-10 years of experience, I can be surprised because all the most basic guides on doing interviews try to teach the principles that I'm about to lay out. Specifically, asking clarifying questions, laying out multiple possible solutions and considering their pros and cons, eliciting feedback from a larger group of technical experts (your interviewers), thinking about project management and communication, etc. These are things that a mentor should be teaching, but I digress.\n\nThe fundamental point in the title which is really bait is that just because you are exceptional at technical solutions doesn't mean you have the capacity to teach someone how to figure out technical problems on their own or pass on technical knowledge. It's just a fundamentally different skill. Sure, it helps to have experience and understand a technical idea in sufficient depth.  \n  \nWhen I was a TA in undergrad, I had the opportunity to work with a lot of people who were varying degrees of clever and varying degrees of good at mentorship. The more hardcore someone was about performing well, often the less a damn they gave about teaching. PhDs were often happy to just give solutions because they had better things to do with their time (research) without actually helping you grasp the concept. I would spend an hour with students who I knew were on the margin in a course because I cared about their desire to actually learn the concepts. I once took a class far outside my capacity and I went to the professor's office hour to give up and get his approval to drop the class. This is a professor that, together with another professor, defined an entire new field of mathematics now considered a branch of studies on par with applied math, pure math, etc. You could say he was the brightest, most technically talented. He stopped me from dropping the course and was willing to sit through every office hour then on to basically repeat what he did in class. I landed with the second highest grade on the final. Point being: technical skill and mentorship being completed divorced abilities that need to be trained and passed on.\n\nBut, the thing I would argue that is disingenuous about the title is the suggestion that the best engineers shouldn't be good mentors. The field has grown manifoldly generation after generation and the reality is that it is imperative for every generation to learn the skill of mentorship and pass on good practices or we're left with underdeveloped engineers building spaghetti crud with programming languages lacking robustness through vibe coding, a viper pit of vulnerable, cruft fattened from hundreds of layers of frameworks resting upon each other like a stack of dried out sticks in a Californian autumn.",

You need to time budget for both. In my career, I feel like the time when I was at my best as a tech lead was a time when I had probably the best manager I’ve ever had. We followed a pattern where assigned work was always done in pairs, and innovation work was solo. It was budgeted at about a 50/50 split (reality was often different, but that was the goal). In pairs we did take that were often new systems that felt like existing patterns. Innovation work was mostly focused on stuff that resulted in new patterns / new tech. \n\nIt was good.",

An important aspect of a good engineer is to become a good mentor.\n\nA good coder is someone who can write correct, efficient, and often elegant code. They understand syntax, algorithms, data structures, and can translate requirements into working software. That skill is valuable and non-trivial.\n\nA good software engineer goes further.\n\nSoftware is rarely built in isolation. Most of the time you’re working on shared codebases, reviewing PRs, aligning on architecture, negotiating trade-offs, and maintaining systems that will outlive your current context. In that environment, raw coding ability isn’t enough.\n\nA strong engineer writes solid code, designs systems with long-term maintainability in mind, communicates trade-offs clearly, documents decisions, reviews others’ work constructively, shares knowledge so the team becomes stronger, not dependent.\n\nThe ability to explain complex ideas in simple terms is not a “soft extra.” It directly impacts team velocity, onboarding, incident response, and architectural clarity. If only one person understands a system, that’s a liability, not excellence.\n\nIn short: a good coder can produce great code alone. A good software engineer helps a team consistently produce great software together.\n\nThe second one is rarer, and far more important.",

People they think have potential, and they get along with them.\n\nOn more than one occasion, I was asked to help people who I felt bad because they had so little potential to become even marginally good programmers. I put zero effort into this.\n\nOther people required tiny bits of guidance every now and then, and often taught me cool new things along the way.\n\nAll my best mentors would give me very basic guidance as to why they were going to do a thing, and made sure I would see them do that thing. I could then appreciate what they were doing so much better.\n\nI learned from one guy the differences between management and leadership. He told me that managing client expectations was my primary job along with protecting my team from the executive.\n\nHe showed me that you mostly manage processes at factories. But people need to be lead. They need a vision to follow. This included the clients and the executive. They have to buy into the vision. You don't badger them into accepting the vision, but they all have to internalize it.\n\nThen, people largely can self manage as they are able to filter their own decisions through that vision. As a leader, you just monitor to see that people aren't modifying or straying from the vision. \n\nDeveloping the vision is a team effort, and modifying as makes sense is as well. \n\nMicromanagers complain about \"herding cats.\"; a sure sign they are a terrible terrible manager. Leaders have the cats follow them.\n\nBut, this is where my best mentor pointed out. If you have cats which won't follow you, is it because they are so smart they know a better place to go. Or, are they just aholes? If the latter fire them, if the former, reexamine your vision.\n\nI learned this very well. When you have that one guy who just won't row in the same direction, regardless of apparent talent, fire them, fire them hard, fire them fast. This is not to strike terror into the team. They will usually high five each other on ahole's departure.",

So, he can patch up things from root cause even though he is a little lazy about coding guidelines and security practises. The other one is previously worked on surface level on a fully developed system, she can do things in structured & standardised way. But, she is not good at debugging & analysis - and sometimes she can't even find the cause of bugs. But, she is a quick learner and learning things fast. So, I am happy with the team.\n\nI also mentoring another team of 4 developers on NestJS - React - Flutter. The developers are working in intern positions & paid very low. SO, their commitments are horrible. But, the flutter developer is good - and she is a fast learner. Also, the senior MERN developer is good - he is the most paid guy - and he is faster. But, there are other two MERN guys - they can't catch up things. There are other 6 testers - 3 of them are seniors - one of them is paid. Their testing is in an average level. Other 3 of them are interns - Their work also ok. On the above of all - There is a project coordinator - she also good - and she works as client support too. Even though mentoring that team (3 MERN developers, 1 Flutter Developer, 6 Testers, 1 Project Coordinator) is a pain - I took that a challenge.\n\nSo, as of my experience, \"Are you good mentor question & are you enjoying it question\" are highly tied to the behaviour of the team you are mentoring. It also varies time to time (according to the progress of the team). In a painful environment - all we can do is try our best.\n\nAnother thing to mention here is: The management of first company is really cool. They understand well & supports well. But, the second one is horrible. they things like coding is a cheap skill, any one can do with a bunch of AI tools. And the developers are very cheap - they don't have to paid at all.

What this means is that you won't be working in a team, you'll be working as a demagogue in a team you expect to follow whatever you say \"because you're the best engineer\", without bothering you to make them understand why.\n\nI utterly hate this \"rockstar developer\" mentality of people that can only work solo, and scoff at the idea of having to work closely with less experienced engineers.\n\nThe article doesn't talk like that, but the attitude \"well I'm a great engineer and I simply don't have the skills to help other people so don't expect me to do so\" is basically the same but in a more lazy way.\n\nSorry but I don't buy that.

I got one cohort, it was by most people's accounts the most useful training in the subject they had ever received. After that, management tightened up again and went back to insisting on more ineffective slop approaches, so I went back to telling them to fuck right off.\n\nIt helped that the department was such a mismanaged dumpster fire by that point that I knew they couldn't afford to fire me.\n\nDid enjoy mentoring on core work though.

All chromium based browsers implement it, and Safari and Firefox are working on supporting it. On the server side, recent versions of Node.js and Python have support, and mature libraries are available in other languages.

That's the part that's \"finally here\".\n\nThe comment about adaptive/prunable dictionaries is interesting too — that would essentially be streaming dictionary updates via delta hashing, roughly how rsync's rolling checksum works.

Programming does it all the time, replacing an enumerated value integer instead of a longer text string. It is not generally considered a change in entropy like we see in compression, merely a tokenization step.\n\nOften the next step after tokenization with a shared dictionary is to encode the tokens with a pre-generated Markov chain, also shared.

This of course would require finding the sweet spot between savings vs the size of the dictionary itself. The dictionary itself might become unoptimal over time as development trends shift, e.g. if everyone starts using a newer keyword frequently or a new framework like Tailwind that changes the characteristics of the code.

Well I guess this project is over…\n\nWith small files with common headers or footers you can get a lot of improvement by letting the compression memory cross file boundaries. It doesn’t have to be a preset dictionary. It can also just be five other similar, short files.",

It operates as described in the article.\n\nThe only human review that is happening is on plans before the agent implements, and even then plans are generated from meeting transcripts.\n\nChanges are pushed directly to master. The agent run uses subagent (orchestrator with planner, implementer, reviewer, tester).\n\nThe review step is a 3-model (sometimes more) summary to get different “opinions”.\n\nAll the context is saved in the repo - plans, chats, docs, references, skills, agent definitions.\n\nPeople work in parallel via worktrees to do multiple changes at once. Neither the reasoning nor the diffs are paid attention to.\n\nNon engineers are making changes to the product. There are no product or design artefacts in the traditional sense. It’s all markdown with diagrams that are fed as context.\n\nThe older stacks are getting fully rewritten (go, protos, microservices, db) to be typescript sql monoliths to move as fast as possible.\n\nTechnical discussions aren’t held because rolling back an architectural change is done via unleashing the agents for an hour. To do or not to do something is answered by summaries pasted back and forth in slack.\n\nIt hasn’t been very fun to work this way for someone deeply technical. People however who see code as means to an end adore this.\n\nIn a sense the craft might be dead. The above is still engineering but in quite a different way. I’m in early stages of founding a company and some investors have expectations about the above. “Building is so fast” is a common phrase I hear.\n\nI’ve never worked in corporate so I don’t know how far behind this wave is, nor have I embraced it but there are more than a few organisations running like this.",

We have one or more other developers fighting over variable names, function abstraction etc before reviewing and approving the work. We don't even trust 2 or more developers to implement the feature and review it, so we have a QA to test the feature. We don't trust the QA to catch regression so we have e2e tests to catch any regression. After e2e tests pass we ask clients to check it before pushing to production. Furthermore, we don't even trust our own team, so we pay a third party to do security audits for any compliance.\n\nNow we are trusting LLMs? The big sized auto correct and suggestions generator? to build software for us?\n\nThe sheer stupidity to say SDLC is dead and there is no need for any of these processes is appalling. There are already 2 big proofs that LLMs cannot do software engineering at scale even with multiple agents. Look at the browser built by cursor and c compiler built by claude. Now imagine if these tasks were implemented through tradition life cycle. They would have had atleast one piece or two pieces of working blocks that they can continue to build. Time is finite, Human cognitive load is finite, Power is finite, Money that can be burnt is finite, but these people talk like all the resources are infinte. It genuinely makes my blood boil.\n\nsorry for the long rant. I am just so over with this overhyping stuff.",

This is a big problem with protobuf generated code, which there's a big stack of when you get into certain ecosystems (and a weirdly huge amount of `envoy` stuff).\n\nI'd love it if Go could do something about this, although the most practical answer is probably for protobuf to improve the quality of code it generates.",

The fact I could (if I was clever enough) write real time ray-traced games that run in the browser is mind-blowing, but it's not something that I would ever get to do in my day job. All I want is to be able to write functions that interact with the dom AND guarantee that the arguments passed to them are actually going to be numbers and not null, an array of objects, or a string that the interpreter will try very hard to assign a numeric value to, because it's only trying to help and having some value is better than throwing an error, no?",

I'm calling emscripten APIs to make REST queries to my backend for the non-native version. I just call emscripten\\_fetch in the [Emscripten REST factory](https://github.com/FlyingRhenquest/RequirementsManager/blob/c49e810e381a52a4b4bd3b002f09a68c36828d0e/include/fr/RequirementsManager/EmscriptenRestFactory.h)\n\n\nThe Imgui interface looks almost exactly the same whether you build it natively or with wasm. You just get a couple more menus under \"file\" in the native version, since that can read directly from the PostgreSQL database or from a file on the local filesystem, as well as through the native version of the REST factory, which is implemented with Pistache's REST query API.\n\n\nYou do need to do some SSL stuff to serve your emscripten-compiled and REST endpoint. My [docker image example](https://github.com/FlyingRhenquest/ImguiWidgets/tree/main/examples/docker) sets that up for a self-signed SSL cert that you can import into your browser if you want to experiment with it.",

              "text": "From an evolutionary perspective it made perfect sense: First there was asm.js which is a strict subset of javascript that a) executed fast on existing engines and b) could be compiled statically, no JIT needed. It practically was wasm, but in JS syntax.\n\nWhat it didn't have was an ABI because you already were in a JS context, so if you wanted to call some DOM method you could just do that. Then the whole thing got upgraded to wasm and people started to think about ABI but it was deemed too complex for an MVP, so the old \"here's a flat region of memory that's how you'll communicate\" is what we got.\n\nIt's been years and years and I haven't looked at the component model for a while but I guess it's getting ready for prime time.\n\nOn the flipside, though, integration already exists. If you're writing your wasm in e.g. rust the end-user code will stay the same when switching from the old stuff to components because from the code perspecive, it's all just rust library functions, no matter how they're implemented or by which mechanism they get called.\n\nWhat this actually enables is better cross-language integration, that is, linking different languages into one wasm module, as well as getting rid of the JS integration, and then finally implementing JS on top of wasm. There's work going on regarding interacting with garbage-collected memory from the wasm side to make that work, wouldn't make sense to have the GC running inside the wasm runtime, especially not multiple GCs from different dynamic language runtimes running inside the runtime. Plus the GC that the browser needs in one way or the other anyway to manage the DOM.\n\n---\n\nThat all said, I have a pet peeve: Non-hosted sites. Things like twine VNs distributed as html files and a folder full of images. If you want to use wasm in those you have two options, launch a webserver instead of using `file://`, or compress your wasm, base-encode it into the html file as a string, and load it as a binary blob, which is ludicrous (but works). Browsers won't load \"external\" wasm files from `file://` URL because CORS policy because don't ask me why. There ought to be something simple, like just put everything in a zip file and rename it to `.webapp`, that allows you to bundle these kinds of projects and not need a webserver. That zip file would also be a great place to put LocalStorage in.",

They're often painted as underdogs relative to Microsoft (and they were), but they were closed-sourcers.  Microsoft cloned JavaScript as JScript anyway (while also pushing their own proprietary VBScript for scripting, shudder).

It makes the map smaller, easier to audit, and removes a latent bug if anyone later reorders the pipeline or reuses the map without NFKC in front of it.",

Think about the \"safe withdrawal ratio\" and extend the timeline out from an oft-cited 30-year period to a longer period (define \"permanently\" - a hundred years?) and increase the assessed risk when running the model. Same math anyone does when setting up a trust with a large endowment in order to fund something in the long-term or as close to perpetuity as they can reasonably ask for -- when you're dead, you can't really vet the fund manager to make sure he's not incompetent or a crook, you do the best you can with rules the trust has to legally follow, and hope it works out, and hope that if there are troubles people will donate to up the funds.\n\nThe oft-cited 4% withdrawal ratio doesn't work for funding designed to be \"in perpetuity.\" You're probably talking more like 2%.\n\nSo if you want to pay (eg) 10 programmers full-time, salary and benefits, and you figure you can get some good folk at below market rate (by US standards) because they believe in the mission, you're talking what, maybe $2m per year so $100m endowment. $100m endowment for a modestly-sized software project is huge sums of money. And that's ignoring the need to pay for other stuff like lawyers, accountants and asset managers and tax guys, auditors, PR guys to raise more money, etc; even a super \"minimal overhead\" endowment that doesn't keep any of those people on permanent staff will still need to occasionally pay them for work. And then note that that endowment and withdrawal ratio wouldn't even remotely come close to paying for everyone needed to work on something huge like - using popular examples we're all familiar with - like the linux kernel, but hell, it wouldn't even pay for something much more limited in scope like git.",

You're describing source-available, not open source. [The OSI definition of open source](https://opensource.org/osd) (which is as close as you can get to a canonical definition) runs counter to your claim, as it does hold the ability to modify, distribute and derive from the original source as crucial. \n\nIt's why the Commons clause is criticized for making software no longer \"**open** source\"",

It was a b2b sass with a lot of constant usage.\n\nMost of the cost was coming from replicated ephemeral environments like the post explains though, that means there were multiple replicas (often up to 10) of the full production database running for manual and automated test environments.\n\nThis was deemed cheaper than constantly managing and updating a smaller db that was not representative of the actual user data and always behind on the actual features.\n\nHope that’s helpful, just trying to provide context!",

RDS takes a full db snapshot periodically but saves the full binlog in between, meaning up to 1min backups are available and they restore pretty quickly.\n- you can get a db replica very quickly, the data is not instantly copied but as needed, you get the db fast and as you access the data it gets moved over into the new instance.\n\nI wouldn’t know how to setup that locally or maintain it or even guarantee for it. I wouldn’t even want to have to guarantee that it would always work. Outages and infra maintenance add costs quickly.",

They talk about having a bill of 80k a month, being lowered to about ~40k a month after migrating to postgres because they could downgrade the instances used.\n\nThey mention many ephemeral instances but don't go into detail about what it entails, but if it costs 40k a month I can assure you you can find something cheaper with a bit of dev work. The pricing of RDS is about x4 the price of the same reserved EC2, and if you pay that much there is definitely a way to greatly lower those costs. Even if it's just using the main in RDS and the other ephemeral databases in EC2s or something else, there is definitely a way to be found. For a potential saving of 100k+ a year, it's not something you should dismiss this fast.",
