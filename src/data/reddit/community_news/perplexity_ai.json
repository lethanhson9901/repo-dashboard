From TODAY coded as 51247, we infer a letter-to-digit mapping: T →→ 5, O →→ 1, D →→ 2, A →→ 4, Y →→ 7. DAY coded as 247 confirms that D is 2, A is 4, and Y is 7. To code TOAD, we map each letter in order: T (5), O (1), A (4), D (2). That gives 5142, not 5724, so this option misapplies the mapping or assumes a positional shift that the question does not justify.                                     ",

      "text": "Dear Perplexity team,\n\nI cancelled my subscription today. Lucky for me, it expires in April, but honestly, I was ready to renew without a second thought until recently. The way I see it, you have six weeks to show me you actually care about paying customers. The clock is ticking.\n\nFor the past ten months, I've been one of your biggest advocates. I recommended Perplexity to colleagues, friends, and anyone who'd listen. At $210/year it was worth every penny to me—a tool that genuinely improved my productivity and fit perfectly into my workflow.\n\nI haven't mentioned it once since the limits started dropping.\n\nAt first, I wasn't too worried about the changes. Then they kept piling on—until the limits dropped faster than Donnie's tariff threats on a Tuesday. When I learned about all the free subscriptions you handed out like candy, it suddenly made sense why you needed to reign in costs. But understanding *why* doesn't make it suck any less for those of us who actually paid real money.\n\nThis week I finally hit the wall where your new limits are actively hurting my productivity. I'm not just disappointed—I'm pissed. I'm pissed because paying customers like me are absorbing the consequences of decisions we didn't make. You promised free candy for a year without checking if you had enough candy, or money to buy candy, and now we're paying the price.\n\n**Here's what you're missing:** You're alienating the exact segment you need most—users willing to pay cold, hard dollars. If you lost most of your free subscribers tomorrow, it'd probably be a godsend to your infrastructure and bottom line. But paying users who cancel or initiate chargebacks? Those people don't come back. You're hemorrhaging the revenue and advocacy that actually matters.\n\nI'm a patient person. I want Perplexity to succeed because you've built something genuinely valuable. But my patience ran out today, and I'm guessing I'm not alone. You're dealing with refund requests and chargeback disputes from people who actually paid money—that's not stopping the bleeding, that's accelerating it.\n\n**Here's how you fix this and win back paying customers:**\n\nCreate a **Pro+ tier at $18/month** with meaningful limits—not the 200 daily Pro searches you had before, but something substantial like 20+ weekly research queries, more file uploads, and the features that made this indispensable.\n\nLet **paying subscribers upgrade by crediting what we've already paid**—we'd only pay the $1/month difference for our remaining subscription time. Got a free promo subscription? No credit for you. Pay full price to upgrade.\n\nThis solves three problems at once:\n\n1. It rewards the people who supported you when it mattered\n2. It creates a new revenue stream from users who actually need higher limits\n3. It stops punishing your paying base to clean up a free-subscription hangover you created\n\nYou have until April to change my mind. Show me you value the people who believed in you enough to pay. Otherwise, I'm gone, and I won't be recommending you to anyone ever again.\n\nYou've built something valuable. Don't torpedo it by punishing the people who believed in it enough to pay.\n\nA (formerly enthusiastic) paying customer",

It's just showing off because the big players are now also good at everything. Adjusting the limits a bit, Perplexity thinks they're elite and think they're good as Claude or others and they even act like others. I mean, I still think it's cheeky that others allows to do that, but they have something others don't, so works market... and all of them demand something for specific customers that only covers their niche... What can Perplexity do? Do better research? Or be more stubborn? That shady company canceled my pro account without even writing a word. Companies like this are later mentioned as losers and cited as examples of what happens when you don't follow customer wishes,\n\nFirst they gave it away for free, then they thought they could make us addicted, then they reduced the supply, supposedly saying \"don't use it too much.\" Why shouldn't I use something I paid for?

      "text": "Until last week, I was a satisfied Perplexity Pro user and was caught off guard by the changes, even though I'm by no means a power user. Here are a few observations:\n\nYou can check the user limits on the following Perplexity pages:\n\n    https://www.perplexity.ai/rest/rate-limit/all\n    https://www.perplexity.ai/rest/user/settings\n\nThe following details are of particular interest to me:\n\n\"remaining\\_pro\":600\n\nThese are the \"normal\" pro searches.\n\n\"remaining\\_research\":3\n\nThese are the \"deep searches,\" whose limit of 20 per month has caused a lot of anger in the user community.\n\n\"upload\\_limit\":50\n\nThis is the number of files (images, screenshots, documents, files, etc.) that you can attach to a request or prompt by uploading them.\n\nLast week, I accidentally burned through my deep searches in a short amount of time because I simply wasn't aware of the limit changes at that point. As far as I can tell, the available deep searches are only replenished at a rate of one per day. So, if I don't perform any deep searches, I'll probably have 4 available tomorrow, 5 the day after, and so on. Regarding the quality of the deep searches, I can say they are truly excellent.\n\nThe limits for \"normal\" searches (pro searches) are more generous than they appear. Sometimes the counter doesn't go down at all after a search; other times, it might drop to 598 after a longer search with several follow-up questions. But after a few minutes, the counter is back at 600. This is handled quite loosely, and you don't hit the limit that quickly. Looking at it objectively, the normal pro searches are perfectly adequate for regular use. Plus, you always have the option to deepen your research significantly through targeted and systematic follow-up questions.\n\nThe upload limit is more critical. If you attach 2 files in a thread, the counter subsequently shows 48 (50 minus 2). This counter seems to replenish after a few hours. Yesterday afternoon around 3:30 pm, I uploaded 2 files, and the counter correctly showed 48. By the evening, it was back at 49, and today it's at 50. However, this is the point that worries me most: in 98% of cases, I'll never exhaust this limit, but I can easily imagine a major project where I might want to analyze that many files all at once.\n\nI recklessly bought an annual plan for Perplexity Pro in August (and paid in full!). So, whether I like it or not, I'm tied to Perplexity for the time being anyway.\n\n# Update\n\nIt looks like I have to correct one of the statements above: I had assumed that the depleted number of available \"deep researches\" would gradually be replenished at a rate of approximately one search per day. However, that doesn't actually seem to be the case. My deep research counter is still at 3 today, and I haven't performed any deep researches since yesterday when I originally posted this: \"remaining\\_research\":3\n\nFrom this, one must conclude that the used limits for \"deep research\" are only topped up at longer intervals, which is of course disappointing.",

Removing one of the core functionalities of the Pro plan is absurd. Because making such limits equals removal of comfortable usage of the Deep Research feature.\n\nNow it seems that the u/Perplexity_ai team is taking the easy way by delegating work to other providers instead of researching on their own ones (or polishing self-hosted models).\n\nI'm glad that it came out before my 1-year promo access expired - I'd love to use the service as it was before, but now the only advantage over other services is access to mid-tier models (like Claude Sonnet, Gemini Pro, ChatGPT 5.2 Reasoning) and very limited Research. The latter functionality uses model probably no average user asked for - even if it's very good, the previous version was just fine and would need just tweaks or using other models like Mistral Large or Kimi, if using own solution seems to be not enough.\n\nNow it's not a business I'd like pay for. Pity, because it was very good.\n\nOver and out. :(",

It suggests they need to get more money to burn to increase market share. They want to gobble up market share from Google. To achieve that the can't limit pro subscribers like this..heck they should be giving more to free ones to tempt them to sign up. \n\nThey'll be hitting the lifetime value of their customers as I'm sure some will cancel their pro subscriptions.\n\nTotally bananas decision and actually very frustrating as a user.\n\nI loved this service until my \"unlimited\" deep research ran out mere days into February. \n\nReally not good enough. Deep research was an outstanding product. Now I have what feels like it ought to be a free trial amount of deep research.....",

I was surprised that it produced a better response than Gemini 3 Pro when I copy-pasted the same prompt into the Gemini app.\n\nThe output completed all the tasks as instructed, and since it was so useful, I exported it as a PDF. Remarkably, that single prompt generated a single 13-page answer—just in normal mode, without any deep research. This reinforces my belief that how you craft and use prompts matters most.

By that time, the market may change significantly, given how established models are also trying to ration the use. \n\nThey have attracted a large number of free users each year. As most of the freebies were last fall, they will expire this fall.   \nSo, if the company's purpose is to capitalise on users (and not attract investors' money again), they basically need to start being very attractive in September.   \nFor now it looks like they intend to treat Pro as a demo version of Max.  \nI'd expect them to gradually introduce new features, incorporating elements from other models, etc., and limiting them to Max, or leaving only a few for Pro.   \nCloser to September, once the hardware market stabilises and several other model aggregators change their models to stay afloat (or further move to token-based transactions), they will increase usage for Pro users (and aggressively communicate that) to keep those Trial users.   \n  \nThat said, they have turned their back on early adopters (like me), who were promoting it, and who are paid users, as for the moment, the value is significantly lower compared to the competition.   \n  \n",

But then my bank offered a one-year free plan for Perplexity.  Seemed like a no-brainer to get a free premium LLM so went with that.  I do find myself going back to Chat every now and then as it just seems smarter in general (maybe more in terms what understanding what I'm trying to get at) when given them the same prompts.  Recently with all the Claude/Clawbot news + Excel Integration, I gave that a try and ended up signing up pro for $30/month with Anthropic even though I have a free year on Perplexity.

I guarantee none of these ppl complaining are even trying to utilize it to it's best abilities. I know I haven't and I've still been satisfied with threads. Then again, I grabbed 1 of the many free trials. Maybe if yall didn't FOMO into something at the last minute or used your brains(even the free perplexity version itself) to find a free trial yall would STFU!! Damn other people are trying to hold discussions and learn here. Yall are fucking it all up from here to the Discord. STFU!!!!\n\nEDIT: Not to mention that if you'd learn to talk, formally at the least, and addressed concerns through an email I'm willing to bet they'd refund you, give you a discount, etc. I know that's a fact bc I've seen it left and right.

Customer retention on a software product highly depends on emotional attachment and dispelling frustrations in which the customer has no fault but his natural earnings power and budget.

I've also noticed that the new model for Deep Research is actually worse than the old one, at least for my use cases.\n\nThe ONE advantage I have had with Perplexity is that it's able to output an MD file I can download.

Perplexity wanted this niche but that window has closed if you can’t do volume Deep research anymore. In the overall search market Google has 90%+.\n- Claude has found a niche in vibe coding and is quickly moving away from being considered  just another LLM and being a service you make apps you dream off. \n\nThere might be space for research that Perplexity is building out but the question is if the value the service provides with its service is “good enough”. There might be enough space in the market for two or three other major players but a lot of the other niche services will either fail or get rolled up. \n\n It should have be a warning when Apple who is failing in the AI space considered purchasing Perplexity look at the books and values and said no. \n\nhttps://medium.com/utopian/perplexity-was-the-google-killer-then-apple-changed-everything-a1fea6a53461",

I think for services like OpenAI, Sam Altman thought scaling was going to reach AGI. Too many people in the technocracy think that humans are replaceable . While I think that the fact that we have inspiration as a species makes us irreplaceable when doing most tasks that humans or the market find valuable. Will LLMs replace some positions? Yes, but that is because they are not organic jobs and are structured. There is a reason why in The Jetsons, the robots did everything but George’s job, was to press a button to make a Spacey Sprocket. It was a commentary on us finding ourselves doing everything but the job we are paid for, educated, or trained on. Even though it didn’t exist, we write emails; they wrote memos. We have meetings and file out paperwork and other tedious tasks.\n\nThe LLM services that are going to survive find their niche, show value to the market, and dominate it. Dario Amodei and the rest of the Anthropic team left because they didn’t believe that scaling LLMs would lead to AGI. Altman and his team do, so we have two different visions. I truly believe that AGI is impossible; the human “soul” is not replaceable. Everything humans have invented is a problem in society that needed a solution, and the inspiration, motivation, and technology met at the same time. Even LLMs meet this criterion. In the developed world, we aren’t having enough children that can produce more, so how are we going to eventually keep or increase our productivity and sustain our society? We develop tools that will allow the market to allocate resources to greater value-producing jobs. It wasn’t productive to have thousands of women patching us into different phones, so we automated the operator. \n\nI’m technical, but I can’t code for my life. I’m able to build out a physical office, lay the low power lines, patch them, and then configure the infrastructure and support it, that my skill set allows. There are apps or services I’ve imagined but can’t make myself. AGI will never exist because to have a general intelligence, you need to exist in the world.

I moved to Max in November, and I felt some quality issues in December, but after the first week of January, they got it solved. OpenAI is suffering, a $20B opportunity, and Anthropic a $9B opportunity, compared to the $200M opportunity in Perplexity, sounds like nothing, right? I understand why they decided to cut the free Pro deal (it was out of control), but now that has made people mad. I get it; it's frustrating. Remember something: Perplexity was the best at research, but they were sued, chased, whatever. Then Anthropic cost more and more (they are limiting Pro access too), so that made Perplexity cut its limits.

Strict verification requirements and time scheduled searches - deterministic outputs when required. It’s started, lots of ways to go as it’s a solo project but I’m sick of every system out there - all are based strictly around “appearing” useful while prioritizing ultra-safe output that first protects the company instead of serves the user. It’s just laziness and UI theatrics these companies are using. All have their “strengths” but the constant bans on behaviors that are required are insane - I’m tired of it and so I’m building what we all need. Glad to hear input and anybody who can help accelerate the build and willing to split profits once it’s there. DM me if interested in getting involved - I’ve got a large part of the code written, but I’m relying on strict verifications and working with the same AIs who could care less about quality not matter how convincing they sound - so a knowledgeable human in the loop who understands the parts I have to learn thru experience would be a massive help. I’m here - 🤙🏻",

I also noticed that performing deep research, it uses both a Research and a Pro Search count.\n\nI'm thinking that Research counts are reloading 1 per 24-48 hours. It's currently been 26 hours since I last used a Research and no count has reloaded yet.\n\nMy guess is that Perplexity is still adjusting the limits and reload in the background several times a day. I think what happened is they gave away too many free Pro trials, and their inference and token costs are burning through their capital without enough revenue to slow it down.

That’s like every two days if you ration it to one use each time! As a health researcher, medical research that’s reliable unbiased and takes everything previously said on the thread into account has been without compare from Perplexity. I still get exceptional use out of it but it’s frustrating how limiting that usage is especially since as far as I know you can’t purchase any more usage of Pro.\nThe pro subscription is quite affordable but with the limit it’s hard to justify paying over triple that per month, when I can justify that hopefully soon, will it still have higher hard limits on Pro and other research use? And Max is even better for researching I bet, but would probably have similarly tight hard limits. For the amount of research I want to do that’s unsatisfactory to wait a month. I don’t want to just drop perplexity it’s really a great service but up until today as I understood Pro was free. Even if the developers created a lesser pro option that was still unlimited that would be great. Because sometimes standard search is not enough. \nI get how ai can use a lot of resources to run and is difficult to keep up with the demand from many users. But I sincerely hope they implement a way to account for  this very soon. It’d be a shame to be forced to get less use out of it when it’s such a gem",

Someone explained it to me in that it is a rolling limit that actually updates more regularly so if you have a limit that you hit, and with a weekly limit you’d think you would have to wait a week. But that wasn’t the case…it was when you did your first query and not hit the max. This meant that you weren’t locked out for the week..but it would change depending on your usage. Those of you hitting monthly limits, are being completely shut down (feature wise) for an entire month? Has anyone gone back in a day or two to check? \n\nTo the OP, I do not know your full usage. But, it may be worth it for you to consider Max. The cost was tough for me but realized that I made up for it in time saved for what I used it for. The money, and especially the time saved, far outweighed the cost. And, it was so much stronger than Pro. Hard to articulate but I can certainly tell the difference.",

I absolutely fell in love with the UX, so I was fully prepared to auto-renew for a full year without a second thought once the promo ended. \n\nMy daily workflow usually involves a mix of studying for civil service exams, software development, and about 4-5 casual RP sessions. But an hour ago, when I tried to upload just 6 markdown files for a study session, I got hit with a \"Upgrade to Max\" popup out of nowhere. Now I’m stuck walking on eggshells, trying to stick to text-only prompts just to keep things moving.\n\nTo be real, I’m only here because the competitors' UX just doesn't hit the same. Perplexity fits my use case perfectly. However, stealthily rolling out limitations on basic features like file uploads stuff that fundamentally breaks a user's workflow is honestly frustrating.\n\nI’ve got a year’s worth of my life and data integrated into this platform. I really don't want to go through the hassle of migrating my entire chat history to another service.

My preferred model selection is repeatedly switched back to 'Best' every few days. \n\nAlso, before I used to be able to continue conversations started from the Comet sidebar but now those conversations cannot be continued in the app, it just says \"this conversation must be continued from the Comet browser\"... and then when I do, I no longer have the ability to choose any custom model to continue the conversation. \n\nPerplexity has the best industry RAG and UI experience, but they lost my confidence when I upgraded to Max and found out that my attachments weren't being retained in context when switch between browser and app.\n\nThey continue to enshitify and they'll probably regret not selling themselves to Apple when they had the chance.",

              "text": "They ran these promotions for several reasons. The main ones I can think of are to rapidly grow their user base and to show exponential growth to investors. The second part of that tactic is to hope that when you give people one free year, they will forget about it and then renew at the end of the year for the entire next year. What they don’t consider is that this will result in a giant pile of chargebacks that won't look good for them in the long run.\n\nAlso, if they actually decided to be acquired, that exponential growth would not have been so impactful. My assumption is they were looking to be acquired, but when everyone started examining their books, seeing their growth potential against that of Google and OpenAI, and anything else they may have noticed, they did not bite.\n\nNow they’re pivoting to enterprise customers because they’re in sustainability mode, just like You.com was half a year ago or more. They’re also cutting back on usage limits because now they have to feed a bunch of non-paying Pro customers for X number of months, depending on when you signed up. Admittedly, I’m one of those free users, but I had been a paying customer for over half a year before I was eligible for one of the promotions. I had no issue paying for the service because it was good, but I would never return to being a paying customer with the recent changes.\n\nI watched another YouTube video that talked about why they’re going to lose to Google in this. One of the main things this person pointed out was that every time Perplexity does a search, it costs them quite a bit of money, whereas when Google does a search, they’ve got that process refined down to where it costs them little to nothing. All they have to do is feed that context into their model and instruct the model on how to do citations, and now they have taken the main strength of what Perplexity brought to the market that no one else was doing a few years ago. Now everyone does it.",

It describes a dishonest act where someone takes unfair advantage financially or creatively, making the victim feel cheated or robbed. In a consumer context, it specifically refers to the diminished value of a transaction. If I pay $20 for \"Feature A\" and you switch it to \"Feature B\" tomorrow without asking, the \"theft\" is the loss of the value I originally agreed to purchase.",
