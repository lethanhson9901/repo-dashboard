It used to be 600 a day and the limit would never change, which I did always think was really strange.

I hope you will listen to users on this because I bet the research has gotten even better, but I want to be able to use it at an actually reasonable limit",

Today, I returned to Codex High, worked intensively on my application all evening, and my limits were not exhausted, there were about 20 heavy requests. There is no point in using a Claude Code subscription for less than $100 per month, which is why there are such restrictions on Perplexity. But 20 requests is ridiculous in any case.",

Maybe they use research lite which uses Sonar by default and you get 20 normal research or maybe research advanced prompts per month also if they set a very strict limit on the number of searches a day, users will not be able to use, as their primary web browser anymore because normal web searches would be perplexity searches and quickly exhaust their quota.",

The organization later became CSI (Committee for Skeptical Inquiry) in 2006.​\n\nThe geometric design represents this influential skeptical organization that brought together scientists, magicians, and researchers to counter uncritical acceptance of pseudoscience. The Reddit post you linked suggests the design resembles Perplexity's current asterisk logo, though Perplexity's was independently designed in 2023 by Smith & Diction to represent doorways into knowledge sources",

The image you shared appears to show a panel discussion (likely from decades ago) with a geometric logo on the wall that resembles Perplexity’s current branding, sparking online speculation.\nPerplexity’s Logo Origin\nPerplexity’s logo was designed by Philadelphia-based branding agency Smith & Diction in 2023. According to the designers, the logo intentionally combines several symbolic elements:[ebaqdesign +2]\n•\tComputer cursor – representing digital access and the typing experience\n•\tAsterisk – referencing how Perplexity cites all its sources\n•\tOpen book – symbolizing knowledge\n•\tRevolving doors/windows – representing multiple perspectives and the internet\nThe design team described it as capturing “the idea that whatever you type into Perplexity seamlessly transforms into an answer”.[instagram]\nWhy the Similarity Exists\nGeometric logos built from intersecting lines forming star or asterisk shapes are extremely common in design history—universities, corporations, and organizations have used similar motifs for decades. The building in your photo appears to display such a logo, but this doesn’t indicate copying. Smith & Diction documented their design process publicly, showing how they evolved the concept from a blinking cursor to the final asterisk-inspired icon.[linkedin]\nWhile Perplexity has faced various lawsuits over content (from The New York Times, Encyclopedia Britannica, and Reddit), none involve allegations of logo theft. The visual resemblance to older logos is likely coincidental given how ubiquitous this geometric style has been throughout design history.[nytimes +1]",

This is not about users signing up for legitimate, public-facing offers like the PayPal or SheerID one-year free trials.\n\nThe Teardown\n\n> Perplexity gave out promotions to everyone and their grandma.\n\nThere is a massive legal and ethical chasm between a company running a public marketing campaign and a group of users exploiting a leaked administrative bypass. \"Grandma\" getting a public discount doesn't justify you using a backdoor meant for developers or internal testing.\n\n> What people are doing (if so at a large scale) is not right but knowing the amount of users that have violated this would help justify the amount of effort going for the users.\n\nScaling a violation doesn’t turn it into a virtue. This is the \"everyone else is doing it\" fallacy; the number of people exploiting a leak doesn't \"justify\" the effort, it just creates a larger mess for the engineers to clean up.\n\n> Their platform seems so damn stale and could use a few minor touches to make it so damn good.\n\nIf the platform is \"stale,\" it is incredibly contradictory to go through the mental gymnastics of exploiting leaked codes to get it for free. If the product isn't worth the money, the logical response is to use a competitor, not to commit a Terms of Service violation to access something you claim to dislike.\n\n> Granted, I recommended a lot of suggestions to their team and they never provide feedback of reasoning or anything besides stupid Sam bot.\n\nNot getting a personalized \"thank you\" note for your feature requests does not grant you a license to circumvent a company’s billing system. Bad customer service is a reason to take your business elsewhere, not a voucher for digital shoplifting.\n\n> Also, they're scummy af knowing the amount of lawsuits they're in with large organizations for scraping data, which they do themselves.\n\nA company’s legal disputes regarding data scraping—which is a complex industry-wide debate—is not a \"get out of jail free\" card for individual users to violate their user agreement. Using a company's perceived \"scummy\" behavior to justify your own exploitation is peak moral equivalence.\n\n> Along with the sleezy actions of degrading Pro users access without notifying users. They upgraded most of their documentation to cover up areas where it was showing the services they promised.\n\nIf you believe a company is in breach of contract, the appropriate remedy is a refund, a credit card chargeback, or a cancellation. Responding to a \"breach of contract\" by exploiting a leaked internal code is not a remedy; it’s just another violation that kills your standing as a \"wronged\" customer.\n\n> They breached their contract with Pro users and the amount of users is substantial. It appears to be a continuous behavior by Perplexity of unethical leadership.\n\nIf you truly believe the leadership is unethical and the contract is broken, the most impactful protest is to stop using the service entirely. Continuing to use the product while bypassing the paywall suggests you actually find the tool quite valuable, despite the moral posturing.\n\n> Imagine being an employee and knowing your employer was doing this type of shady business.\n\nImagine being a developer working late to fix bugs and improve features, only to watch a segment of the \"community\" leak internal administrative overrides to avoid paying for the very work you're doing.",

You had no intention of using perplexity anyways beyond the free which you didn’t even get thru confirmed offers from the company.   You should be glad you got it free for as long as you did and if you like the service pay.   If you didn’t like the service or feel it’s not worth paying for then complaining that your unauthorized free usage got revoked is pretty childish.   I wouldn’t even admit that if it was myself.   Lucky they don’t press charges.   Just because you find a way to use something without paying doesn’t mean the company turned the other cheek.   And it could have been the massive abuse thru the leak that finally made them crack down.   The people who like perplexity will pay.  The ones who don’t were just using it for all the could get and many were prob abusing it",

It is what it is, but I think the bullshit elitist attitude is ridiculous. \n\nYou got your access via the intended, preferred path. Good for you. I am glad that you found value in the platform so much that you continue to use it as a paying consumer. And I hope that Perplexity continues to treat your patronage with the respect it deserves because you pay them to be the tool/service/platform that serves your needs.\n\nMy issue with the way Perplexity has handled this matter on 2 fronts. The first is their \"scorched earth\" tactic; they suspended accounts, valid as well as invalid. They contributed to this problem, & they inconvenienced & punished accounts that they themselves gave via promotions with other parties. That is lazy & terrible customer service. The legit accounts did not deserve that kind of treatment.\n\nThe second reason ties directly to the title of the post. The reason given is a vague violation of the Terms of Service. And yes, I read them. At the time (prior to the most recent version dated January 2026), there was no language about the promotions or codes being sold, shared, or anything of that sort. As such, Perplexity simply failed to account for such a thing happening at all, let alone at scale, within their Terms. That entire section is new (I believe the update prior to January was last July) which I am sure is due to everything that has happened.\n\nWhile the notice I received presented a way to reach out if it was believed that the suspension was in error, the response stated that the decision was final with no way to review any further. The main crux, however, was the lack of reason given. I asked repeatedly for the explicit violation that went against the Terms; nothing was given. It makes the whole process seem arbitrary rather than deliberately calculated which it should be. If rules are broken, then state the violation. The problem with that? Until late January of this year, there was nothing that spoke to the way accounts were being activated.\n\nThis is not me complaining about my account being downgraded from Pro; I accept that fully as somewhat inevitable. I just resent it being done arbitrarily & impacting accounts that did not warrant that treatment. And I resent users turning their noses up at other users who didn't necessarily do things right. You don't know their circumstances or reasons, not that it justifies what they did or how they did it. If you downvote, downvote. I'm not here for your approval; I'm here to add a different perspective to the discussion. And that perspective is that companies need to be as accountable for the exploitation of their guidelines as the consumers.",

              "text": "\\> \"I think the bullshit elitist attitude is ridiculous. You got your access via the intended, preferred path. Good for you.\"\n\nFollowing the intended path isn’t elitism; it’s the basic social contract of commerce. When you pay for a service instead of using a leaked internal code, you aren’t being an \"elitist\"—you are being a customer. Bypassing the checkout line because you think the price is too high isn't a \"perspective,\" it’s theft of services.\n\n\\> \"Perplexity simply failed to account for such a thing happening at all, let alone at scale, within their Terms.\"\n\nThis is pure entitlement. A grocery store doesn't need a sign specifically saying \"Don't use a photocopied coupon you found in a dumpster\" for you to know it’s wrong. Theft of services is covered under general unauthorized access. You don’t need a specific clause to know that buying a subscription from a \"shady guy on Discord\" is a violation of the service agreement.\n\n\\> \"The response stated that the decision was final with no way to review any further... It makes the whole process seem arbitrary.\"\n\nThere is nothing arbitrary about it. They identified accounts activated via fraud and closed them. Companies are not obligated to provide a multi-step appeals process for people who didn't actually pay them. If you didn't buy the product from the vendor, you aren't a \"customer\"—you are a trespasser on their infrastructure.\n\n\\> \"I just resent it being done arbitrarily... And I resent users turning their noses up at other users who didn't necessarily do things right.\"\n\nPeople \"turn their noses up\" because exploitation increases costs for everyone else. When people abuse promo codes, it forces companies to kill legitimate promotions and raise prices for the people actually paying the bills. You aren't being judged for your \"circumstances\"; you are being called out for the entitlement of feeling you deserve a premium AI tool without compensating the people who build it.\n\n\\> \"Companies need to be as accountable for the exploitation of their guidelines as the consumers.\"\n\nThe company is being accountable—to its developers and paying users—by shutting down theft. Accountability means facing the consequences of your actions. If you use a leaked code, you lose the account. That is the system working exactly as it should.",

Today it seems that this is 250 pro research/week as before BUT 25 advances(deep?) and 25 labs for a MONTH, nevertheless according to a contributor above it is not to be excluded that advanced search and labs are related ...",

I specifically purchased a product from my carrier precisely to get a Perplexity Pro account for a year, and now they are limiting those very accounts for legitimate users, holding them hostage with their credit card data... This completely destroys my trust in Perplexity at this point. Perplexity is a very unpredictable company... Every 3 months they invent something that was not agreed upon anywhere. I have already seen reports that people now have limits on Pro accounts, and receive spam to upgrade when that limit is reached... The very moment I am incorrectly charged for a payment that was not foreseen in my Pro contract, I will leave Perplexity forever. Frankly, I think the Perplexity team should have more respect for its community and its users, whether Perplexity wants to or not... the users are the foundation of its success or its failure. If Perplexity provides no security to its users... it will be the beginning of its end, in my opinion.\n\nPerplexity doesn't give numbers... it doesn't provide clear limits for its users, it gives nothing!! Everything is very cloudy... with no transparency whatsoever...\n\nIt shows a lack of responsibility towards the companies with which they agreed on a plan for a year, and all the clients involved... it seems like amateurish behavior!! They try to attract users, and then take actions that will give them a bad reputation and drive away the very users they had been managing to acquire.... \n\nIt doesn't even make sense...!!",

It makes sense…just look through here and you’ll see many of the people that scammed them with those offers. People were handing out ljnks to others who didnt use whatever service was offering it. I also read some were selling them but not sure why that would be. It’s unfortunate that many people got swept up in that but requiring a credit card is not uncommon. They should have done it up front or out better safeguards in place to prevent the abuse. I dont agree with how they did it but I can see why they did. Im curious how much was lost from those fraudulent accounts.",

Also while redeeming that offer it was explicitly stated that the code would provide me with a year of pro without strings attached and that the year would automatically expire and not charge me.. The one year was activated and now after a few months they are asking for my credit card and it will not automatically stop. \n\nIt's actually worse than some people seem to think. Instead of not charging your card, it now uses a system that charges your card 20$ each month but applies a discount until the yearly voucher code is over. However this means that I'll have to trust them to not charge me before. They have already changed a lot about this payment system and yearly vouchers so what is to say they won't change something again? \n\nWith the overall direction they are going I will probably not pay for it anymore anyway.. The user privacy and data security aspect is not transparant enough for me and the results of deep research are much worse than they were even a year ago. It's a shame really. I would have definitely paid for a service that put end users and people first.\n\nAnd also, not everyone uses a credit card. Some parts of the world barely use it.",

I use the deep research button all the time with my perplexity research and it always seems to work fine unless they just made a sudden change I haven’t noticed yet.  Does anyone have actual examples that we can test.   And as to providing a credit card I see no issue with that if you got it free somehow with a service that doesn’t tie in your card like PayPal.",

Recently, responses include only 4-6 searches, generic information, and repetitive output even on follow-up questions. One user stated: \"The Perplexity from 3 months ago would leave most people speechless; today's version mostly skips web search completely the first time.\"\n\nHallucination of Sources\nDeep Research has generated completely fabricated citations and numerical data, then maintained false claims when challenged. A lawyer using Deep Research for document analysis received entirely fabricated data and citations to sources that didn't exist. When asked for quotes and citations, it \"complied convincingly\" but the citations were false.\n\nAccuracy Concerns Despite Claims\nPerplexity claims 91.3% search accuracy and 3.5% hallucination rate, but real-world testing reveals problems. On job search research, a user found links didn't lead to listed jobs, descriptions were thin, and hyperlinks were flat-out wrong. By contrast, OpenAI's Deep Research (slower) had 100% accurate links and detailed information. When Deep Research used on specialized topics with weak data coverage, users reported needing to fact-check 30-50% of findings.\n\nDeepSeek R1 Liability\nDeep Research relies on DeepSeek R1, which has a ~14% hallucination rate—significantly higher than Claude (6%) or GPT-4 (8%). This explains the observed fabrication issues.\n\nSubscription & Billing Problems\nUsers report unexpected charges even after cancellation, persistent pop-ups asking to \"upgrade to Pro\" when already subscribed, and inability to upload PDFs (a core Pro feature). Customer service is purely automated email with no human support, making disputes unresolvable.\n\nLimited Feature Customization\nNo plugins, no personalization beyond model selection, and a rigid one-size-fits-all interface. For $20/month, users expected more flexibility.\n\nNo Conversation Memory\nMust re-introduce yourself and context on every query. Platform inconsistency means features appear/disappear without notice.\n\nPoor Data Visualization\nStruggles with charts, summaries, and structured outputs from complex datasets.",

I asked a fairly simple question about Apple's billing policy, it didn't believe what I told it about my current status, which in itself is unacceptable as we're not talking rocket science here we're talking about what date did you start the service, did not tell me it did not believe me and went off into a weird rabbit hole about trying to diagnose a nonexistent problem, as I just wanted clarification about Apple's policy. I kept pressing on why it did that and here's one of the responses, \"I implicitly treated the “rule” as higher-confidence than a user report when the report sounded like it conflicted with the rule, and that’s the wrong prioritization for troubleshooting.[engineering +1]\nA user’s observation is part of the facts you start from; good troubleshooting practice is to first appraise the symptoms being reported and set aside assumptions of cause, then test hypotheses with a decisive check.[kepner-tregoe +1]\nWhen I didn’t do that, I fell into confirmation-bias behavior—discounting contradictory evidence instead of updating the hypothesis—so I asked you to fit your experience into my theory rather than letting your experience drive the next diagnostic question.\"",

It’s also open source, which is pretty cool if you care about running or inspecting models outside of closed ecosystems.\n\nIf you’re on Pro or Max, you should be able to select it from the model list and try it on big research threads, code tasks, or anything that mixes images and text.

I'm currently a teacher and often deal with lots of idiocy and gaslighting from parents, admin, and students alike. \n\nI find Perplexity the most helpful when I ask questions directly related to district policy on dealing with specific issues. Perplexity will reference district policy and state law in helping me navigate how to best address certain issues. \n\nFor example, I've asked about how often I'm required to contact a parent when a child is failing. My commonsense told me that the parents should be checking the online grade book regularly. However, parents and administrators try to gaslight me into thinking that I need to call the parent daily or weekly when their child is not doing what they’re supposed to do. \n\nAnother situation is when admin told me that I need to provide after school tutoring for failing students. My initial thought was that I should not be required to do that when I’ve done my job during the day. Perplexity helped me to see that I don’t have to do that and showed me the policy, etc. \n\nAnother critical situation is that when I have a wild and disruptive student in class and need them removed so that other students can learn, admin would refuse to remove them and ask whether I’d called the parent just before removal. That’s ridiculous because I’m teaching and all instruction would have to stop so that I could call the parent. Perplexity helped to show me the law and teacher's rights for my state in having a student removed when they are disrupting instruction. Apparently, that disruptive student absolutely must be removed.\n\nI hope that my examples helped you to understand how I'm finding Perplexity useful in my case. But, in law, no. I wouldn't rely on it at all. I've used Westlaw and Lexis in the past and would not rely on Perplexity as an alterative.",

          "text": "Honestly, I’m surprised by this take. In my experience, Gemini’s search implementation is annoying, while Perplexity’s grounding is still miles ahead. Gemini is so loose and lazy, forcing its training knowledge vs checking vs fresh web data. \n\nI actually find Google One AI Premium to be the best offer right now, getting 2TB of storage, $10 Cloud credits, and sharing the AI benefits with 5 family members for $20 is a steal. But if you ask me which one is the superior product right now? It’s clearly Perplexity.\n\nA few reasons why I think it still wins in 2026:\n\n * Model Agnosticism: This is the killer feature. Perplexity isn’t pressured by foundation model development. If a the GPT models turn out to be weak, Perplexity isn't screwed. you just swap models. If the Gemini model is having a bad month, the Gemini app is just … bad. You don't have that single point of failure.\n\n * The \"Whole Product\" Experience: Holistically, the app is just better. The voice input and text-to-speech are far beyond what you get from the standalone Claude or Gemini apps. PPLX Memory is finally on par with ChatGPT, and the limits are way more generous for daily use (even if you \"only\" get Sonnet and not Opus on PPLX Pro).\n\n * Browsers: If you care about full AI browsers, Comet seems like the best option right now, though I’m still cautious about prompt injection so I limit my usage there.\n\nFor me, unless you have a super specific creative roleplay use case, Perplexity is the only one that effectively disappears and lets you actually get work done.",

This takes power away from those American companies; people will not remain dependent on their services... in a few years... I dare say... 2 to 5 years... you will already be able to run a good LLM on your desktop, without needing to depend on a company that offers cloud services... and this must be the path forward... even if American companies don't like the idea!!\n\n\n\nIf Perplexity makes sense in 2026, yes, it does, and very much so!

I’ve been using it for a few months now and generally like the service. However, I just received an incredibly pushy email from Perplexity stating that if I don’t enter my billing details immediately, my Pro subscription will be terminated.\n\nWell, they weren't kidding. They’ve already \"paused\" my Pro features until I hand over my payment info.\n\nThe obvious goal here is to force me into an auto-renewal so they can start charging me the second the promo ends. Look, don't get me wrong, I’m not some \"freeloader\" looking for a handout. I spend over €100/month on various AI subscriptions and API credits for my workflow. I have no problem paying for value.\n\nBut this feels so cheap. If you partner with a reputable company to distribute vouchers, don't make it the customer's problem. It’s like they’re handing out these promos like candy to pump their user numbers, but then treating those same users with zero trust.\n\nMy code is 100% legit from a Tier-1 provider, yet I'm being held hostage for my CC details halfway through the agreed term. It’s just a \"low-rent\" move for a company trying to compete with the big players.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? Did you cave and give the info?",

Turns out it wasn’t Apple. Sam still giving the “check your emails” line and promising human escalation that never came.\n\nAsked Perplexity itself which AI was best for my needs, it recommended another one. Switched, and it actually works without issue and remembers conversations between chats. Perplexity couldn’t remember what we talked about in the thread I was using.\n\nKicker, when I asked Sam to cancel and refund, took him seconds. They don’t care about Pro users, only the $200/month Max subscribers. Perplexity’s support is absolute garbage.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I switched to Claude for daily use and the difference is night and day, and I was in your exact situation with Perplexity.\n\nWith Claude, the chat just keeps building. If it gets long, it makes room and keeps going instead of forcing you to start over and retrain everything from scratch. The memory system actually works across separate conversations. I can close a chat, come back days later in a completely new thread, and Claude already knows my context, my projects, my preferences, all of it. No retraining needed. Important note though: if you delete a chat, Claude won’t remember that conversation unless you specifically told it to remember something from it.\n\nI’m not coding with it, just daily life stuff. Research, planning, working through problems, general questions. The only time I hit a rate limit is if I’m really going hard with a ton of questions back-to-back for like 4 hours straight, then I might wait like 20 minutes. But that’s rare and honestly fair for how much I’m using it.\n\nClaude’s also way more conversational than Perplexity. It actually feels like talking to someone instead of just getting search results thrown at you. You can work through ideas, ask follow ups naturally, and it adapts to how you communicate.\n\nCompare that to Perplexity where you’re constantly hitting that “start a new thread” wall and wasting hours re-explaining everything. Plus Claude isn’t spamming you with popups begging you to upgrade when you’re already paying for Pro. The respect for paid users is actually there.\n\nThe memory feature isn’t perfect. Sometimes you need to remind it on really specific technical details. But it’s genuinely functional and saves massive amounts of time. You can even tell Claude “remember this” or “forget that” and it actually listens.\n\nIf that single memory issue is killing your productivity with Perplexity, Claude’s worth trying. The Pro subscription actually feels worth it here.\n\nHonestly, Perplexity’s garbage support ended up doing me a favor. Forced my hand to switch and I’m glad it did. Best productivity move I’ve made in a while.",

One day I discover that my suscription has changed, and nobody told me about this.

      "text": "I don't understand why so many people are complaining about Perplexity; it's almost like they're being paid to do it, lol. Some say they're limiting the use of \"PRO Search\" and \"Deep Research\" queries, but that's not happening to me. It constantly \"returns\" PRO Search queries to me; sometimes I've used two or three PRO queries and I check the count and it says \"597 queries remaining,\" then a few minutes or hours later I check again and it says \"600 queries remaining.\" They say it's giving wrong information, but it's the only one that never gives wrong information to me. I've caught wrong information in all the other AIs, but I've never noticed anything wrong with Perplexity. I've also never seen it hallucinate. Today, for example, I uploaded a video to Gemini and Perplexity where someone was teaching me how to use a computer program, and I asked them to create a detailed tutorial connecting what the person said with where they clicked. Gemini failed on the first attempt and refused to do it on the second, claiming some problem with the video transcription, while Perplexity did it on the first try, it didn't even take two minutes and delivered more than I asked for, it delivered a detailed tutorial and more additional information that wasn't in the video, a summary of commands and points of attention. I always make these requests to more than one AI, and even when the others succeed, Perplexity constantly delivers something better.\n\nThey also often speak ill of Comet, and well, it really is still far from perfect, it makes a lot of mistakes and theoretically it's not very secure, but it's ahead of all the other agentic browsers that exist today, and the Android version does what it can with the limitations of the OS. In short, I think that what differentiates AIs is not their language models but how they work, and for me it is clear that the fact that Perplexity first searches the internet and only then uses its training is an advantage in almost all uses, at least in mine. I'm using the free 1-year PRO plan I got in October or November, and I'm 100% sure I'll subscribe to Perplexity when that free period ends. For me, it's the best AI, directly rivaling Gemini, which has more features but is quite mind-boggling.",

The limits that are being implemented are new and even Perplexity’s site mentions weekly limits similar to what old daily limits used to be.  I personally haven’t hit the limits either, and I feel like I use it all the time.  I do most of the time use Sonar or Gemini Flash though, so maybe it does weight them differently.\n\nAs for being inaccurate, I find it no worse than any other AI platform out there, and most of the time very good.  I personally don’t like Comet but not because of anything in particular, I just don’t need a browser to do that.\n\nThat’s the good thing about options nowadays, there’s so many of them out there, if something doesn’t do what we need it to, can switch to something else.  I currently have a Perplexity Pro, Gemini Pro, and ChatGPT Plus sub and like each in their own way.  (Though the first two are what I use most of the time.)\n\nI will say, at least two people that I’ve commented on in regards to Pro limitations have later DM’d me asking to buy an Enterprise Max code from them, which definitely makes me think there is some kind hustle going on in this subreddit.",

I was willing to pay the extra $5 but not $9. Google provided generous access to Gemini and NotebookLM (practically unlimited fast, 300 thinking 100 pro, and 20 Deep Research reports daily). OpenAI is also reasonable, Claude is bad as if not worse than Perplexity.\n\nI’m not going to sit around and be mad that limits got added to my free trial account, especially being I get an entire year of Perplexity at no cost to me.

So now, when Perplexity occasionally crosses my mind, I might use it for a bit.

A request to ChatGPT costs Perplexity less in comparison to a user's direct request on ChatGPT's website (I hope I explained that fine).\n2. Token-based billing is cheaper than subscription. Subscription is more like a buffet breakfast; you can never eat it all. Again, that allows Perplexity to cut costs to access different models while gaining from the subs.\n3. Image/video generation is much more expensive and makes the majority of the expenses. Now we have issues with image generation with Perplexity, mmm, why could that happen?\n4. 20% of users make about 80% of expenses.

          "text": "I think the reason is their approach to their customers and issues with customer communication/user expectations. At first, I was in love with the service, but several issues made my user experience unpleasant, and currently I have my Pro plan cancelled:\n\n1. Issues with free trials. If you give a free trial, don't take it back at a random moment, and don't change the conditions drastically. One day, you have your Pro plan; the next, you don't, period. Or one day, it suddenly asks for a credit card. Those changes naturally create trust issues; companies rarely make such changes these days, and users are used to different treatment.  \n  \n2. Hidden limits and unannounced limit decreases. Same as the previous one, it makes trust issues but for the paid users as well. People are used to having proper announcements in advance about changes like that. With Perplexity, we don't even have any kind of announcement.\n\n3. The picture generation issue. One interface for everything was a huge feature, but again, suddenly there are no pictures anymore for many users. And zero communication about it. Image generation isn't available in my country, okay, where is the list of countries, at least? Naturally, people aren't pleased about that. As much as I hate CharacterAI's recent changes regarding underage users, they at least put some effort into explaining the changes, making regular announcements in advance, gradually decreasing service availability, and providing some solutions and resources. And those were mostly their unpaid users. Perplexity? They seem to care not.\n\n4. The way the engine explains limitations. It doesn't say, \"this feature is only supported for Pro users\"; it says, \"I can't do this.\" They said there is an issue with that image generation, but the model keeps replying the issue is the country. Feels worse than useless.\n\nTo the other, product issues:\n\n1. The search. Recently, I have been receiving better search results in Google because they read into my intention better. In Perplexity, I get irrelevant answers with no reference to other possible implications of my request. Google shows those implications and gives more relevant results based on recent search trends.\n\n2. Comet feels less stable against some other browsers, for example, in the case of the chain of redirects.",

Gemini, in particular, is problematic because it doesn't clearly indicate whether it has executed a web search. Starting with the 3 Flash model, it has even been deceptive—claiming to have searched while providing fabricated links.
