You fill that gap with money from investors, not by trying to break even or even a profit.\n\nDevelopments in this area are going fast and competition is stiff. Also, consumers aren't loyal to brands yet.\n\nI get why they do it, I just think they're shooting themselves in the foot by pricing themselves out of the market.",

From TODAY coded as 51247, we infer a letter-to-digit mapping: T →→ 5, O →→ 1, D →→ 2, A →→ 4, Y →→ 7. DAY coded as 247 confirms that D is 2, A is 4, and Y is 7. To code TOAD, we map each letter in order: T (5), O (1), A (4), D (2). That gives 5142, not 5724, so this option misapplies the mapping or assumes a positional shift that the question does not justify.                                     ",

      "text": "Dear Perplexity team,\n\nI cancelled my subscription today. Lucky for me, it expires in April, but honestly, I was ready to renew without a second thought until recently. The way I see it, you have six weeks to show me you actually care about paying customers. The clock is ticking.\n\nFor the past ten months, I've been one of your biggest advocates. I recommended Perplexity to colleagues, friends, and anyone who'd listen. At $210/year it was worth every penny to me—a tool that genuinely improved my productivity and fit perfectly into my workflow.\n\nI haven't mentioned it once since the limits started dropping.\n\nAt first, I wasn't too worried about the changes. Then they kept piling on—until the limits dropped faster than Donnie's tariff threats on a Tuesday. When I learned about all the free subscriptions you handed out like candy, it suddenly made sense why you needed to reign in costs. But understanding *why* doesn't make it suck any less for those of us who actually paid real money.\n\nThis week I finally hit the wall where your new limits are actively hurting my productivity. I'm not just disappointed—I'm pissed. I'm pissed because paying customers like me are absorbing the consequences of decisions we didn't make. You promised free candy for a year without checking if you had enough candy, or money to buy candy, and now we're paying the price.\n\n**Here's what you're missing:** You're alienating the exact segment you need most—users willing to pay cold, hard dollars. If you lost most of your free subscribers tomorrow, it'd probably be a godsend to your infrastructure and bottom line. But paying users who cancel or initiate chargebacks? Those people don't come back. You're hemorrhaging the revenue and advocacy that actually matters.\n\nI'm a patient person. I want Perplexity to succeed because you've built something genuinely valuable. But my patience ran out today, and I'm guessing I'm not alone. You're dealing with refund requests and chargeback disputes from people who actually paid money—that's not stopping the bleeding, that's accelerating it.\n\n**Here's how you fix this and win back paying customers:**\n\nCreate a **Pro+ tier at $18/month** with meaningful limits—not the 200 daily Pro searches you had before, but something substantial like 20+ weekly research queries, more file uploads, and the features that made this indispensable.\n\nLet **paying subscribers upgrade by crediting what we've already paid**—we'd only pay the $1/month difference for our remaining subscription time. Got a free promo subscription? No credit for you. Pay full price to upgrade.\n\nThis solves three problems at once:\n\n1. It rewards the people who supported you when it mattered\n2. It creates a new revenue stream from users who actually need higher limits\n3. It stops punishing your paying base to clean up a free-subscription hangover you created\n\nYou have until April to change my mind. Show me you value the people who believed in you enough to pay. Otherwise, I'm gone, and I won't be recommending you to anyone ever again.\n\nYou've built something valuable. Don't torpedo it by punishing the people who believed in it enough to pay.\n\nA (formerly enthusiastic) paying customer",

It's just showing off because the big players are now also good at everything. Adjusting the limits a bit, Perplexity thinks they're elite and think they're good as Claude or others and they even act like others. I mean, I still think it's cheeky that others allows to do that, but they have something others don't, so works market... and all of them demand something for specific customers that only covers their niche...

Companies like this are later mentioned as losers and cited as examples of what happens when you don't follow customer wishes,\n\nFirst they gave it away for free, then they thought they could make us addicted, then they reduced the supply, supposedly saying \"don't use it too much.\" Why shouldn't I use something I paid for?

In Claude they list their models with a separate option for  Extended Thinking. Perplexity seems to have gotten rid of the toggle and grouped them together so it’s easier to intentionally choose the one you want– with fewer places to go to piece together models and modes.",

By that time, the market may change significantly, given how established models are also trying to ration the use. \n\nThey have attracted a large number of free users each year. As most of the freebies were last fall, they will expire this fall.   \nSo, if the company's purpose is to capitalise on users (and not attract investors' money again), they basically need to start being very attractive in September.   \nFor now it looks like they intend to treat Pro as a demo version of Max.  \nI'd expect them to gradually introduce new features, incorporating elements from other models, etc., and limiting them to Max, or leaving only a few for Pro.   \nCloser to September, once the hardware market stabilises and several other model aggregators change their models to stay afloat (or further move to token-based transactions), they will increase usage for Pro users (and aggressively communicate that) to keep those Trial users.   \n  \nThat said, they have turned their back on early adopters (like me), who were promoting it, and who are paid users, as for the moment, the value is significantly lower compared to the competition.   \n  \n",

The additional cost was only going to be about $10 CAD more per month vs $30 CAD with ChatGPT and users in my family plan get access to Gemini Pro as well.  But then my bank offered a one-year free plan for Perplexity.  Seemed like a no-brainer to get a free premium LLM so went with that.  I do find myself going back to Chat every now and then as it just seems smarter in general (maybe more in terms what understanding what I'm trying to get at) when given them the same prompts.  Recently with all the Claude/Clawbot news + Excel Integration, I gave that a try and ended up signing up pro for $30/month with Anthropic even though I have a free year on Perplexity.  I would likely not use or pay for Perplexity going forward unless it was for free to be honest. ",

I guarantee none of these ppl complaining are even trying to utilize it to it's best abilities. I know I haven't and I've still been satisfied with threads. Then again, I grabbed 1 of the many free trials. Maybe if yall didn't FOMO into something at the last minute or used your brains(even the free perplexity version itself) to find a free trial yall would STFU!! Damn other people are trying to hold discussions and learn here. Yall are fucking it all up from here to the Discord. STFU!!!!\n\nEDIT: Not to mention that if you'd learn to talk, formally at the least, and addressed concerns through an email I'm willing to bet they'd refund you, give you a discount, etc. I know that's a fact bc I've seen it left and right.

              "text": "Here's the cherry on top. Drum roll please... You thought you had access to different models, but you had access to them in a limited, confined, and system-prompted version within the confines of Perplexity search and Deep Research. So Gemini 3 Pro or GPT 5.2 thinking cloud sonnet, or even now Cloud Opus 4.6 in Perplexit, is not exactly what it is in their own respective chatbots or when using them with their own API. They're all limited to a 32K context window. You can literally test this by giving them the same prompts for a Deep Research or Web Search, checking the Gemini 3 Pro check, and using Gemini 3 Pro in Perplexity. Does the same thing with GPT 5.2, thinking this was always a misleading thing, Perplexity ever since they included all these different models. The amount of logic, reasoning, analysis, and \"intelligence\" that those models have within their own chatbots or when used with your API key is not the same as what Perplexity offers.   \n  \nPerplexity does nothing better than Gemini besides a faster Web Search and Deep Research. The same goes for ChatGPT. ChatGPT offers the best chatbot experience; it's the jack-of-all-trades. To be honest, it's good at everything, but it's not great at any one thing besides its long memory feature. Their Deep Research is quite amazing, though. It's the most thorough, extensive, and detailed, and it uses actual reasoning; it actually analyzes and synthesizes the information. It's not just feeding you information; it's guiding you through it, and it has actually synthesized and understood your prompt. You could tell it has understood what you are doing because it is very thorough and detailed, and it has used reasoning.   \n  \nGemini's Deep Research is also amazing, thanks to Google's indexing. I mean, think about it. He wrote the game on the search engine that they have the most access to sources, so Gemini's Deep Research is also visually appealing. It uses headings and subheadings, and you can easily export them to Google Docs. Keeping the same formatting is just more convenient that way, and they use visuals as well. With Gemini AI Pro, which is the same price as Perplexity Pro, you get 20 Deep Research reports per day, and you get 100 Gemini 3 Pro queries per day. You get NotebookLM Pro, 2 terabytes of Google Drive storage, the ability to create up to 1000 images with Nano Banana, and access to Whisk and Flow. You get Gemini in virtually all Google work apps. You might think this is not a big deal, but summarizing an hour-long podcast is a great deal, to be honest. Or easily transcribing a YouTube video that doesn't have a transcription available. And don't even let me get started on NotebookLM. Noble Galam alone has more features than Perplexity offers as a whole, and it also gives you a 1-million-context window. While there are some arguments that they don't actually go up to 1 million context, at least they can read 30+ page PDFs accurately, have the best OCR capability for PDFs, and, because of their large context window, are the best for uploading files. They have so many features, honestly, Google is winning this AI race like there's no competition. They can afford to lose billions with Gemini; they simply don't care. Gemini is a side project of theirs.   \n  \nGoogle's main \"service\" is ads, and their main product is \"data\"; that's how they make revenue; that's it. And they don't just make an AI chatbot; the entire goal is not just AI. They make software, hardware, apps, and they have the world's largest search engine. They have access to more data than all of the tech companies combined. They have much more resources, funding, investors, engineers, etc. than Propexity. Even OpenAI can't keep up with them anymore, and they're taking ChatGPT users and market share day by day. , let alone Perplexity. That's why they're offering generous usage limits and adding so many updates and features literally every six weeks.   \n  \nNotebookLM alone underwent more improvements in six months than Perplexity did in two years. I'm just frustrated because I loved Perplexity, and I really wanted them to do well. I used it at my university for my business and personal searches; it was the best for AI web search, deep research, and web scanning.

                  "text": "I mean, who really wants to create a slide deck, generate images, or run scheduled tasks with Perplexity? They also tried to imitate ChatGPT and Gemini by including all these different features, none of which are nearly as good as ChatGPT or Gemini. Like their memory feature, for instance, which was a disaster. To this day, it feels like it's in beta mode.   \n  \nEspecially now that we only get 25 deep research queries per month, if ChatGPT Plus is offering 25 per month, well, at least they have the best chatbot, the most app connectors, the best memory feature, and great reasoning models like GPT 5.2 thinking. They give you 3000 queries per week, it's that, not that they're not even in the same league. Perplexity is only a niche, and the only advantage was the accurate, fast web search, deep research, and filtering sources on the academic social web, etc. Still, both Gemini and ChatGPT have improved their deep research exponentially.   \n  \nThe pro search isn't really a \"pro\" feature this is regular web search i mean chat gpt web search does the same thing as Perplexity's pro search to be honest but Perplexity's deep research was what mattered people use it for even small searches because it was thorough accurate provided citations so much information and so much sources in a clear format clear refined format i could have done a deep research on any topic with Perplexity and learn it or truly become up to date on a new product on it or troubleshooting something a software issue whatever it may be and it's not the fact that their deep research queries are limited to 25 per month right now it's the fact that they lied to us they should have gave people a warning in advance and cutting it by more than 95 percent   \n  \nokay instead of giving us 600 per day maybe they should have given us at least 50 per day or even 20 per day instead of 25 per month I was I will stay out with Perplexity tell eternity if they honestly gave me 20 deep research queries per day or even 10 per day let's go even lower that's still 300 per month way more than ChatGPT Plus and even more than chat GPT Pro but no they cut it so much because of their mismanagement because they're running out of money they were looking for an exit   \n  \nthey thought Apple is gonna buy them or another big tech companies gonna buy them why do I think they were looking for exit because they try to increase their user base exponentially by giving away free promotions left and right their growth wasn't natural or organic it was forced, while Chatgpt, Grok, Gemini and Claude were natural and organic people pay for the service they find value in it naturally it grows these chat bots are only as valuable as several paid users they have. Still, Perplexity tries to force their growth by giving away free promotions left and right, with usage limits that are more than generous, to lure customers in, and all of a sudden cut it down by more than 95%. See if tomorrow Gemini AI Pro cuts down their deep research to 10 per day, people will still stay because it offers so much more. It's not entirely revolved around deep research. But PerpPerplexity's niche, advantage, and great feature were its deep research. That's the difference. \n\nIt's really ironic and funny that people keep saying Google is greedy and it's a monopoly. Listen, I don't disagree, they are a monopoly, but at least they're not misleading their customers, and they're giving away very generous usage limits. I'm a university student, and I have been subscribed to Perplexity for more than a year and a half now. But when they introduced Education Pro, I subscribed. It was $5/month, but then they raised it to $9.99 without any updates, notifications, or news. All of a sudden, I saw it's $9.99.\n\nOn the other hand, Gemini is offering 12 months free for Gemini AI Pro for all university students. I saw so many people within this subreddit attacking Google and saying, \"Oh, Google is going down.\" Perplexity offered to buy Chrom,e which was honestly a very stupid and funny thing because they could never even afford it. But everyone was siding with Perplexity against Google. Yeah, fight the power, fight the big monopoly Google. But now look who's over the smaller company. ",

Customer retention on a software product highly depends on emotional attachment and dispelling frustrations in which the customer has no fault but his natural earnings power and budget.

They're both pretty good; I'll probably go with Gemini because one of my use cases is for academic research and it's better, but Grok has actually done a really good job with some deep analysis I needed for my business.\n\nSince I have a business I did upgrade to Perplexity Enterprise, which has better limits... it's deducting from the credits I have left on my one year Pro subscription, and when it runs out, I won't be renewing.  I've also noticed that the new model for Deep Research is actually worse than the old one, at least for my use cases.\n\nThe ONE advantage I have had with Perplexity is that it's able to output an MD file I can download.  Gemini and Grok don't seem to have the capability to export a document (or if they do, I haven't found it yet).\n\nIt's interesting that they started to give refunds yesterday - probably getting a lot of chargebacks.",

Perplexity wanted this niche but that window has closed if you can’t do volume Deep research anymore. In the overall search market Google has 90%+.\n- Claude has found a niche in vibe coding and is quickly moving away from being considered  just another LLM and being a service you make apps you dream off. \n\nThere might be space for research that Perplexity is building out but the question is if the value the service provides with its service is “good enough”. There might be enough space in the market for two or three other major players but a lot of the other niche services will either fail or get rolled up. \n\n It should have be a warning when Apple who is failing in the AI space considered purchasing Perplexity look at the books and values and said no. \n\nhttps://medium.com/utopian/perplexity-was-the-google-killer-then-apple-changed-everything-a1fea6a53461",

I think for services like OpenAI, Sam Altman thought scaling was going to reach AGI. Too many people in the technocracy think that humans are replaceable . While I think that the fact that we have inspiration as a species makes us irreplaceable when doing most tasks that humans or the market find valuable. Will LLMs replace some positions? Yes, but that is because they are not organic jobs and are structured. There is a reason why in The Jetsons, the robots did everything but George’s job, was to press a button to make a Spacey Sprocket. It was a commentary on us finding ourselves doing everything but the job we are paid for, educated, or trained on. Even though it didn’t exist, we write emails; they wrote memos. We have meetings and file out paperwork and other tedious tasks.\n\nThe LLM services that are going to survive find their niche, show value to the market, and dominate it. Dario Amodei and the rest of the Anthropic team left because they didn’t believe that scaling LLMs would lead to AGI. Altman and his team do, so we have two different visions. I truly believe that AGI is impossible; the human “soul” is not replaceable. Everything humans have invented is a problem in society that needed a solution, and the inspiration, motivation, and technology met at the same time. Even LLMs meet this criterion. In the developed world, we aren’t having enough children that can produce more, so how are we going to eventually keep or increase our productivity and sustain our society? We develop tools that will allow the market to allocate resources to greater value-producing jobs. It wasn’t productive to have thousands of women patching us into different phones, so we automated the operator. \n\nI’m technical, but I can’t code for my life. I’m able to build out a physical office, lay the low power lines, patch them, and then configure the infrastructure and support it, that my skill set allows. There are apps or services I’ve imagined but can’t make myself. AGI will never exist because to have a general intelligence, you need to exist in the world. If the smartest people with trillions spent and almost all the information that humans have made in our 12,000 years of civilization can’t give LLMs nuance to understand the world we exist in text, then it will not reach AGI.",

Perplexity's team in just the last couple of weeks show they care nothing about their customer base and think new ones will just replacement. Even OpenAI regularly tells their customers when they are changing pricing and features while Perplexity just doesn't give a sh#t. They will eventually be bought out by a bigger company, or they will fire their current team members when they loose enough customers and hire a more customer friendly bunch. Transparency in pricing and letting customers know what's changing is the hallmark of a successful service company which the current version of Perplexity isn't. ",

Strict verification requirements and time scheduled searches - deterministic outputs when required. It’s started, lots of ways to go as it’s a solo project but I’m sick of every system out there - all are based strictly around “appearing” useful while prioritizing ultra-safe output that first protects the company instead of serves the user. It’s just laziness and UI theatrics these companies are using. All have their “strengths” but the constant bans on behaviors that are required are insane - I’m tired of it and so I’m building what we all need. Glad to hear input and anybody who can help accelerate the build and willing to split profits once it’s there. DM me if interested in getting involved - I’ve got a large part of the code written, but I’m relying on strict verifications and working with the same AIs who could care less about quality not matter how convincing they sound - so a knowledgeable human in the loop who understands the parts I have to learn thru experience would be a massive help.

              "text": "They ran these promotions for several reasons. The main ones I can think of are to rapidly grow their user base and to show exponential growth to investors. The second part of that tactic is to hope that when you give people one free year, they will forget about it and then renew at the end of the year for the entire next year. What they don’t consider is that this will result in a giant pile of chargebacks that won't look good for them in the long run.\n\nAlso, if they actually decided to be acquired, that exponential growth would not have been so impactful. My assumption is they were looking to be acquired, but when everyone started examining their books, seeing their growth potential against that of Google and OpenAI, and anything else they may have noticed, they did not bite.\n\nNow they’re pivoting to enterprise customers because they’re in sustainability mode, just like You.com was half a year ago or more. They’re also cutting back on usage limits because now they have to feed a bunch of non-paying Pro customers for X number of months, depending on when you signed up. Admittedly, I’m one of those free users, but I had been a paying customer for over half a year before I was eligible for one of the promotions. I had no issue paying for the service because it was good, but I would never return to being a paying customer with the recent changes.\n\nI watched another YouTube video that talked about why they’re going to lose to Google in this. One of the main things this person pointed out was that every time Perplexity does a search, it costs them quite a bit of money, whereas when Google does a search, they’ve got that process refined down to where it costs them little to nothing. All they have to do is feed that context into their model and instruct the model on how to do citations, and now they have taken the main strength of what Perplexity brought to the market that no one else was doing a few years ago. Now everyone does it.",

Anyone who says otherwise is wrong. Aside from collecting and selling your data what use does an AI browser have on mobile? And lastly the model quality has dropped massively so you’re better off using Google anyway.\n\nAnyway peace out\n\n![gif](giphy|nFFguNjdeotwc)",

If you've never been to America, I'll give you some good advice about what it's like here – people make tons of grammatical errors, don't write or speak correctly, and they live with this communication every day because everyone understands each other. Others see the mistakes, aren't happy, but they don't nitpick every person or every conversation. There are people like you, little rats, who will point out things in every discussion. Fake it out for good luck :)",
