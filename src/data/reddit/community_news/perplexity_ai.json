      "text": "For starters, if you see me get banned or this post removed, you will understand the kind of damage control the employees and moderators of Perplexity have been doing all along. I have DMed and received DMs from multiple people who previously made posts criticizing a certain service and questioning why these issues were happening to them. Shortly after, their posts were removed and they were permanently banned from this sub.\n\nBefore coming to the issue of Deep Research being reduced, it is necessary to point out that the company’s scummy behavior began with the deliberate rerouting of models.\n\n1. Re-routing\n\nIn the past, the model was silently rerouted to inferior and cheaper alternatives. For those who do not understand the chart below, the network requests can be easily tracked using a variety of tools, as the model name is included in the request payload.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95aku8o6biig1.png?width=1655&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9ddaaf7d244c200faf267ef8467a692dc7732eb\n\nOne such example:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/266cgpurbiig1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=476d9a82c8f232b373991f7b4a38e05296f97973\n\n2. Thorttling Answers\n\nAfter this, the issue was supposedly fixed by showing a prompt at the end stating that the model had been rerouted due to unavailability. However, we then started seeing severely degraded answer quality, even for Pro users, who appeared to be throttled.\n\n3. Image Generation being Reduced.\n\nEven for Pro users, image generation, which was supposedly “unlimited,” was throttled. We began seeing monthly limitations, and image generation was eventually geo-blocked to specific locations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q2gdfheodiig1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e87f952c29b0b6bab57b82930bb8efdd5f9f4e4\n\n4. Deep-Research\n\nFor starters, Deep Research is listed as unlimited in the “Select your plan” section.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fevlkigxdiig1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=765ac33f5a438dbf9d5a3d5fda186b51be49700b\n\nHowever, the real scumminess of the company becomes apparent when you look deeper into the terms and conditions. For example, around August, Deep Research was supposed to be limited to 500 queries per day.\n\nPro queries were also supposed to be unlimited, as shown in the image below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lb7e62wveiig1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fe1df3acb6b25b138af5fc714b27332c6061fbd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7b84kza9eiig1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=738d9daac9fe42d48ce9f36c15ec0d554f729c53\n\nHowever, both have now been throttled and reduced, effectively scamming their customers, especially those who pay for Pro annually, by deliberately changing the terms of their contract midway, which is arguably illegal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cyk4amnteiig1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=78b51cc0c881ee4c8582047c168a3efd12bdb6c1\n\nThe webpages have been changed, but they previously stated that Deep Research was unlimited. For some reason, the Wayback Machine is unable to fetch the page at that URL.\n\nI hope Perplexity stops this scamming behavior for the better, or that someone buys the company and turns it around or there are better alternatives.",

I was surprised that it produced a better response than Gemini 3 Pro when I copy-pasted the same prompt into the Gemini app.\n\nThe output completed all the tasks as instructed, and since it was so useful, I exported it as a PDF. Remarkably, that single prompt generated a single 13-page answer—just in normal mode, without any deep research. This reinforces my belief that how you craft and use prompts matters most. I hope they increase the deep research limit soon!!",

From TODAY coded as 51247, we infer a letter-to-digit mapping: T →→ 5, O →→ 1, D →→ 2, A →→ 4, Y →→ 7. DAY coded as 247 confirms that D is 2, A is 4, and Y is 7. To code TOAD, we map each letter in order: T (5), O (1), A (4), D (2). That gives 5142, not 5724, so this option misapplies the mapping or assumes a positional shift that the question does not justify.                                     ",

      "text": "My Perplexity account renewed for a year on February 2, 2026. At that time, the rate limits and other changes that brought me to this subreddit hadn't been implemented yet. I remember checking the website, and it still claimed to offer \"unlimited\" Pro searches and Deep Research. Despite not using Perplexity at all this month, I currently only have 4 research queries and 9 labs available.\n\nI sent an email requesting a cancellation because Perplexity altered the service between my charge date and the end of their 72-hour refund period; all without notifying me. While a Terms of Service (TOS) might allow a company to modify its offerings, they are still obligated to notify the customer. This is why companies like Amazon or Netflix post notices when content is leaving or provide countdowns.\n\nChanging the entire value proposition overnight while the website still advertises the old terms is deceptive and fits the definition of a scam. While Perplexity can change their service as they see fit, they must provide notice and offer customers a prorated refund if they disagree with the new terms. You cannot claim to provide 1,000 movies a month and then only deliver 10; that is a classic bait-and-switch, which is illegal under FTC guidelines.\n\nTo make matters worse, when I told Perplexity Support (which is an AI) that the company was acting like a criminal enterprise, it claimed I was \"threatening\" it. The AI then informed me that my account would be suspended if I requested a chargeback through my credit card. I hope a class action lawsuit is in the works; I would join it in a heartbeat. Regardless, I am going to ensure no one else gets swindled by this company.",

                  "text": "The best alternative is Gemini. In Gemini, the value for money is just insane tbh. They have not slashed usage limits. In the Gemini Ai Pro Plan, you have 100 Gemini 3 Pro queries per day, and 300 queries per day with Gemini 3 Thinking. You get NotebookLM Pro, with the ability to create 500 notebooks, each with 300 sources, a 1-million-context-window, 20 deep research reports per day, and 2TB of Google Drive storage.\n\nPlus, Google's web indexing and access to sources are still unmatched. After all, they perfected web search and the Google search engine for 25 years and wrote the game on it.\n\nAnd yoiu get access to nano banana and anno banana pro...\n\nSure, call Google greedy as much as you want. Quite frankly, in terms of all the AI companies and all the chatbots that are out there, Gemini is giving you the best value right now. And btw, if you're a university student, you get 12 months free for Gemini AI Pro, which is just crazy.\n\nAll that for $25/month. Now compare that Perplexity Pro, which is the same price, and see how much you're getting now. Even back then, Perplexity gave you 600 Deep Research Queries per day; what people seem to forget is that Perplexity's Deep Research Reports are very concise due to its limited context window. So a Deep Research Report with Gemini is much more thorough, extensive, detailed, and uses visual images. You can export it to a Google Doc, and from there you can export it as a PDF, text file, docx file, or whatever format you want. Gemini is truly the best right now.\n\nChatGPT still has the best chatbot experience and the best long-term memory. It's still unmatched in doing those things. They have the most partnerships with other apps through their app connectors, like Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), Apple Music, Spotify, etc., but in terms of a mid-tier plan with generous usage limits and a powerful model, Gemini is still the best. Also, the fact that you can have it in Docs in Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Drive, virtually all the google workspace workspace apps and in youtube it's just wild i could literally paste a youtube video link and ask it to give me the full transcription or just have access to it on youtube itself to summarize a video or get the full transcription easily. That's great for large podcasts, lectures, documentaries, or videos you're watching.\n\nI still have ChatGPT Pro, but Gemini AI Pro truly feels like it's a high-end 200-300-dollar... dollar tier, which makes me think Google might raise prices and add a cheaper tier below Gemini AI Pro in the future, since they offer such generous limits. I hope they don't slash it. And I don't think they will because for Google, Gemini is a side project. They honestly don't care if they're losing money- they could invest dozens of billions of dollars a year just in Gemini alone, and they wouldn't care. They're just a much larger company with more investors, more funding, more resources, more engineers. For companies like Perplexity, OpenAI, and Anthropic, all they have is their chatbot. They don't make hardware, software or apps. So if they're not the best, they're losing, and they're dead, but Google can afford to give people generous usage limits and all these features while keeping prices competitive.\n\nIn fact, Gemini is taking so many ChatGPT users, and they increased their market share exponentially with the release of Gemini 3. \n\nChatGPT for daily redundant tasks and searches, and Gemini for larger tasks and work, cuz of the context window. That's my workflow right now.\n\nNow, Gemini Ultra is just over the top, to be honest. I mean, who truly needs 500 deep research queries per day (especially since Gemini deep research queries take 10-20 minutes to finish)? Still, the best stack right now, honestly, if you are willing to spend the money, is ChatGPT Pro because of access to GPT 5.2 Pro and the amount of deep research queries you get, 250 per day, and on ChatGPT, the deep research is still the most well-reasoned. It actually analyzes and synthesizes the information. It's still the best quality and the most accurate, but it's the slowest and has the fewest usage limits for the tier that it's in. By comparison, Gemini Ultra is $250/month, and it gives you 500 deep research queries per day. But ChatGPT Pro is $200/month, and it gives you 250 deep research queries per month, but only 125 of them are comprehensive deep research. The other 125 are limited to deep research. This means it searches fewer websites, and there are reasons for it.",

          "text": "I agree that this is a scam, and what they are doing is very misleading and shady. This is grounds for a lawsuit. Seriously. At the same time, I am not condoning what they did, but again I am going to explain why they slashed the limits, which is still Perplexity's fault and own idiotic mismanagement. \n\nIf you give away free subscriptions, free annual promotions, and plans left and right, this is what's going to happen. It costs them so much money, and they couldn't keep up, and people took advantage of it because it was so easy to get free annual pro subscriptions or just make a new PayPal account or this or that, you know, all these deals that they did in an attempt to garner more users. And increase their market cap to secure an exit. This is the disaster that happens after all of that. You can't just overnight cut deep research limits for more than 90% of users. No company does this. Perplexity will not survive another two years, mark my words. If they continue like this, they will not survive.\nAlso, for any real amount of demanding work, Perplexity is useless. It truly is. \n\nThey also mislead new customers when they say you have access to these models. You have access to these models, which are system-prompted by Perplexity and refined and optimized within its parameters. For web search and deep research, they're all limited to a 32k context window. Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini and Gemini 3 Pro and Perplexity are not the same. You can literally test this out by giving them both the same prompt - it's just night and day. Even this is the same across all models: GPT 5.2, thinking, and ChatGPT are much better than it is in Perplexity.\n\nPerplexity is only good right now for quick fact-checking, checking the weather, getting news updates, price-checking, and looking up the definition of a word. Something so simple. For any real amount of demanding work, it's useless to be honest. It used to be better, but since they introduced the Max tier, they've nerfed the Pro tier like crazy. I remember starting to use it in December 2024, and I subscribed right away in January 2025 because I saw value in it. Back then, a deep research query could take 15 to 20 to 25 minutes. It was reasonable for much longer, and it searched for much longer, and it also scoured more sources. Yeah, it wasn't as accurate, but at least the answers were more thorough. I mean, a Chad GPT or Gemini deep research report is just night and day compared to Perplexity. So much better. I would say a ChatGPT web search is on par with Perplexity's deep research. That's the difference, truly enough. And I am right now using the factors Perplexity Pro, Gemini Ultra ChatGPT Pro, and Super Grok. So I know what I'm talking about. I've been subscribed to all of these for more than a year and a half now. \n\nAnd they're so stupid that they give away free promotions and deals for annual pro subscriptions, thinking that people will turn those users into paid users. It won't. Anyone who is a heavy AI user, or even uses it casually but daily, would pay for it. I mean, even after the annual subscription, they would pay for it, but they gave away so many free promotions, and I don't know if there's any return on that. Essentially, they want the current Pro subscribers to become Max subscribers. And once that happens, then they're going to nerf the Max tier and include another tier. This is literally a house of cards, and it's a cycle of fraud. \n\nThe best chatbot right now, by far, with the best usage limits, is Gemini. ChatGPT still has the best long memory, the most app connectors, and the best chatbot. But Gemini has the best models. It gives you 2 terabytes of cloud storage, even with the mid-tier, and access to NotebookLM, the best image and video generation model.\n\nIf you're deeply into the Google Workspace, well, but there's no question you have to go with Gemini. You use it in Gmail, Chrome, YouTube, Slides, Docs, and everything. My advice is that every Perplexity customer who's not satisfied should just move to Gemini. Because Gemini's deep research is actually very visually appealing to users, it uses headings and subheadings, you can export it to Docs and maintain the same format, and it uses visuals. Google's indexing is also unmatched, and its deep research is very accurate, with access to many sources. And it gives you very generous limits, something like 25 deep research queries per day on Gemini Pro and something like 100 per day on the Ultra. Chad GPT still gives you 25 per month in Chad GPT Plus, but only 10 of those are deep research; the rest are limited to pre-search (or, as I like to call them, extended web search). \n\nBut I would much rather pay for Chad GPT Plus and Gemini Pro together and Supergrok than ever pay for Perplexity Max, because, as perplexing as Max is(pun intended), I don't see the value in it and the\n The price is abysmally high. \n\nIt doesn't make any difference; you just get more usage limits. But again, Perplexity is flawed at its core. They tried to imitate ChatGPT by introducing image and video generation, scheduled tasks, etc., but they neglected what made them special and what they were great at: web search and deep research. \n\nThey fell behind heavily, but Gemini and Chad GPT improved their web search and deep research so much over the past year that, in my opinion, they're better than Perplexity. I don't know, and they're great at multiple things. They're not just great at web search and deep research.",

It is a violation of consumer protection standards to charge a customer for an annual subscription and then (immediately after payment and the refund window closes for me), materially downgrade that service without notice or an option for a refund. When I paid for this subscription, I entered into a binding business contract: I provided a specific dollar amount in exchange for an agreed-upon level of service. By slashing the value of that service overnight without offering a way out, Perplexity has failed to honor the original terms of our agreement.\"",

If this was a mistake, they would have communicated with the communities by now, considering it’s been over a week. This is intentional, and that’s why I label Perplexity a scam. It’s not a small startup that made a mistake; they intended to provide the Perplexity service we were accustomed to while paying and then abruptly end it.

          "text": "The only \"scam\" is the lousy defamation campaign going on here on reddit. I have been having fun prodding and provoking the way police do in JCS interrogations. A childish story of woe is given in this subreddit: obvious flaws in the narrative are presented. What should happen? The story should not contain elements to explain away the glaring inconsistencies. But that's exactly what happens, and still, it doesn't ring true because it's not true, organic, or grassroots. This is a few bad actors trying to explain away their lies. Anyone who actually uses Perplexity knows things are being replaced with vastly superior functions. So yeah, you try to obscure the truth by saying they took something away without disclosing they replaced it with something superior.\n\nIf there was *any* truth to it, operatives here wouldn't keep changing their stories. It was repeatedly mentioned recently that all big tech companies constantly change their ToS -- it was never mentioned, when suddenly it is. Why? Because the slanderers realized they had a huge gapping inconsistency in their bullshit story and think they can post a new version, not realizing that just proves they aren't honest.\n\nThe only scam going on is in this subreddit. You have bullies who are jealous because they will never succeed in life; so they look for someone they think they can wear down. All it does it make people who see how incredible Perplexity is and go for Max, like I have done. I have gotten many people to try Pro and Max -- not a single person has any of these complaints. \n\nJim can't swim -- and neither can you.",

      "text": "Until last week, I was a satisfied Perplexity Pro user and was caught off guard by the changes, even though I'm by no means a power user. Here are a few observations:\n\nYou can check the user limits on the following Perplexity pages:\n\n    https://www.perplexity.ai/rest/rate-limit/all\n    https://www.perplexity.ai/rest/user/settings\n\nThe following details are of particular interest to me:\n\n\"remaining\\_pro\":600\n\nThese are the \"normal\" pro searches.\n\n\"remaining\\_research\":3\n\nThese are the \"deep searches,\" whose limit of 20 per month has caused a lot of anger in the user community.\n\n\"upload\\_limit\":50\n\nThis is the number of files (images, screenshots, documents, files, etc.) that you can attach to a request or prompt by uploading them.\n\nLast week, I accidentally burned through my deep searches in a short amount of time because I simply wasn't aware of the limit changes at that point. As far as I can tell, the available deep searches are only replenished at a rate of one per day. So, if I don't perform any deep searches, I'll probably have 4 available tomorrow, 5 the day after, and so on. Regarding the quality of the deep searches, I can say they are truly excellent.\n\nThe limits for \"normal\" searches (pro searches) are more generous than they appear. Sometimes the counter doesn't go down at all after a search; other times, it might drop to 598 after a longer search with several follow-up questions. But after a few minutes, the counter is back at 600. This is handled quite loosely, and you don't hit the limit that quickly. Looking at it objectively, the normal pro searches are perfectly adequate for regular use. Plus, you always have the option to deepen your research significantly through targeted and systematic follow-up questions.\n\nThe upload limit is more critical. If you attach 2 files in a thread, the counter subsequently shows 48 (50 minus 2). This counter seems to replenish after a few hours. Yesterday afternoon around 3:30 pm, I uploaded 2 files, and the counter correctly showed 48. By the evening, it was back at 49, and today it's at 50. However, this is the point that worries me most: in 98% of cases, I'll never exhaust this limit, but I can easily imagine a major project where I might want to analyze that many files all at once.\n\nI recklessly bought an annual plan for Perplexity Pro in August (and paid in full!). So, whether I like it or not, I'm tied to Perplexity for the time being anyway.\n\n# Update\n\nIt looks like I have to correct one of the statements above: I had assumed that the depleted number of available \"deep researches\" would gradually be replenished at a rate of approximately one search per day. However, that doesn't actually seem to be the case. My deep research counter is still at 3 today, and I haven't performed any deep researches since yesterday when I originally posted this: \"remaining\\_research\":3\n\nFrom this, one must conclude that the used limits for \"deep research\" are only topped up at longer intervals, which is of course disappointing.",

Removing one of the core functionalities of the Pro plan is absurd. Because making such limits equals removal of comfortable usage of the Deep Research feature.\n\nNow it seems that the u/Perplexity_ai team is taking the easy way by delegating work to other providers instead of researching on their own ones (or polishing self-hosted models).\n\nI'm glad that it came out before my 1-year promo access expired - I'd love to use the service as it was before, but now the only advantage over other services is access to mid-tier models (like Claude Sonnet, Gemini Pro, ChatGPT 5.2 Reasoning) and very limited Research. The latter functionality uses model probably no average user asked for - even if it's very good, the previous version was just fine and would need just tweaks or using other models like Mistral Large or Kimi, if using own solution seems to be not enough.\n\nNow it's not a business I'd like pay for. Pity, because it was very good.\n\nOver and out. :(",

I used to absolutely love this app-great UI/UX, good value for money, etc.—until recently when things changed drastically.\n\nAs a Pro user, I can't even use it properly anymore because they've lowered their limits so much. I feel completely stuck. I usually hit the cap just discussing a single topic before seeing that infamous message saying l've reached my limit. Their base model, Sonar, is as dumb as a GPT-4 mini.\n\nI also noticed another change that drove me crazy. Since I used the app's dictation feature instead of typing my prompts by hand, my requests used to be sent and transcribed on their server using their speech-to-text model.\n\nBut with their latest update, they cheaped out on this too. They now use the iPhone's local Apple dictation model, which performs so much worse.\n\nIs everyone else having the same experience?",

Since most of the freebies were last autumn, they will expire this autumn. By that time, the market may change significantly, given how established models are also trying to ration the use. \n\nThey have attracted a large number of free users each year. As most of the freebies were last fall, they will expire this fall.   \nSo, if the company's purpose is to capitalise on users (and not attract investors' money again), they basically need to start being very attractive in September.   \nFor now it looks like they intend to treat Pro as a demo version of Max.  \nI'd expect them to gradually introduce new features, incorporating elements from other models, etc., and limiting them to Max, or leaving only a few for Pro.   \nCloser to September, once the hardware market stabilises and several other model aggregators change their models to stay afloat (or further move to token-based transactions), they will increase usage for Pro users (and aggressively communicate that) to keep those Trial users.   \n  \nThat said, they have turned their back on early adopters (like me), who were promoting it, and who are paid users, as for the moment, the value is significantly lower compared to the competition.   \n  \n",

That’s like every two days if you ration it to one use each time! As a health researcher, medical research that’s reliable unbiased and takes everything previously said on the thread into account has been without compare from Perplexity. I still get exceptional use out of it but it’s frustrating how limiting that usage is especially since as far as I know you can’t purchase any more usage of Pro.\nThe pro subscription is quite affordable but with the limit it’s hard to justify paying over triple that per month, when I can justify that hopefully soon, will it still have higher hard limits on Pro and other research use? And Max is even better for researching I bet, but would probably have similarly tight hard limits. For the amount of research I want to do that’s unsatisfactory to wait a month. I don’t want to just drop perplexity it’s really a great service but up until today as I understood Pro was free. Even if the developers created a lesser pro option that was still unlimited that would be great. Because sometimes standard search is not enough. \nI get how ai can use a lot of resources to run and is difficult to keep up with the demand from many users. But I sincerely hope they implement a way to account for  this very soon. It’d be a shame to be forced to get less use out of it when it’s such a gem",

Someone explained it to me in that it is a rolling limit that actually updates more regularly so if you have a limit that you hit, and with a weekly limit you’d think you would have to wait a week. But that wasn’t the case…it was when you did your first query and not hit the max. This meant that you weren’t locked out for the week..but it would change depending on your usage. Those of you hitting monthly limits, are being completely shut down (feature wise) for an entire month? Has anyone gone back in a day or two to check? \n\nTo the OP, I do not know your full usage. But, it may be worth it for you to consider Max. The cost was tough for me but realized that I made up for it in time saved for what I used it for. The money, and especially the time saved, far outweighed the cost. And, it was so much stronger than Pro. Hard to articulate but I can certainly tell the difference.",

But still it is bad practice to put such pressure on anyone who got a paid version, irrespectively of whether he paid, since it is dumb to do that if one got it for free. Customer retention on a software product highly depends on emotional attachment and dispelling frustrations in which the customer has no fault but his natural earnings power and budget.

They're both pretty good; I'll probably go with Gemini because one of my use cases is for academic research and it's better, but Grok has actually done a really good job with some deep analysis I needed for my business.\n\nSince I have a business I did upgrade to Perplexity Enterprise, which has better limits... it's deducting from the credits I have left on my one year Pro subscription, and when it runs out, I won't be renewing.  I've also noticed that the new model for Deep Research is actually worse than the old one, at least for my use cases.\n\nThe ONE advantage I have had with Perplexity is that it's able to output an MD file I can download.  Gemini and Grok don't seem to have the capability to export a document (or if they do, I haven't found it yet).\n\nIt's interesting that they started to give refunds yesterday - probably getting a lot of chargebacks.",

Perplexity wanted this niche but that window has closed if you can’t do volume Deep research anymore. In the overall search market Google has 90%+.\n- Claude has found a niche in vibe coding and is quickly moving away from being considered  just another LLM and being a service you make apps you dream off. \n\nThere might be space for research that Perplexity is building out but the question is if the value the service provides with its service is “good enough”. There might be enough space in the market for two or three other major players but a lot of the other niche services will either fail or get rolled up. \n\n It should have be a warning when Apple who is failing in the AI space considered purchasing Perplexity look at the books and values and said no. \n\nhttps://medium.com/utopian/perplexity-was-the-google-killer-then-apple-changed-everything-a1fea6a53461",

I think for services like OpenAI, Sam Altman thought scaling was going to reach AGI. Too many people in the technocracy think that humans are replaceable . While I think that the fact that we have inspiration as a species makes us irreplaceable when doing most tasks that humans or the market find valuable. Will LLMs replace some positions? Yes, but that is because they are not organic jobs and are structured. There is a reason why in The Jetsons, the robots did everything but George’s job, was to press a button to make a Spacey Sprocket. It was a commentary on us finding ourselves doing everything but the job we are paid for, educated, or trained on. Even though it didn’t exist, we write emails; they wrote memos. We have meetings and file out paperwork and other tedious tasks.\n\nThe LLM services that are going to survive find their niche, show value to the market, and dominate it. Dario Amodei and the rest of the Anthropic team left because they didn’t believe that scaling LLMs would lead to AGI. Altman and his team do, so we have two different visions. I truly believe that AGI is impossible; the human “soul” is not replaceable. Everything humans have invented is a problem in society that needed a solution, and the inspiration, motivation, and technology met at the same time. Even LLMs meet this criterion. In the developed world, we aren’t having enough children that can produce more, so how are we going to eventually keep or increase our productivity and sustain our society? We develop tools that will allow the market to allocate resources to greater value-producing jobs. It wasn’t productive to have thousands of women patching us into different phones, so we automated the operator. \n\nI’m technical, but I can’t code for my life. I’m able to build out a physical office, lay the low power lines, patch them, and then configure the infrastructure and support it, that my skill set allows. There are apps or services I’ve imagined but can’t make myself. AGI will never exist because to have a general intelligence, you need to exist in the world. If the smartest people with trillions spent and almost all the information that humans have made in our 12,000 years of civilization can’t give LLMs nuance to understand the world we exist in text, then it will not reach AGI.",

Remember something: Perplexity was the best at research, but they were sued, chased, whatever.

All have their “strengths” but the constant bans on behaviors that are required are insane - I’m tired of it and so I’m building what we all need. Glad to hear input and anybody who can help accelerate the build and willing to split profits once it’s there. DM me if interested in getting involved - I’ve got a large part of the code written, but I’m relying on strict verifications and working with the same AIs who could care less about quality not matter how convincing they sound - so a knowledgeable human in the loop who understands the parts I have to learn thru experience would be a massive help.

Now I’m stuck walking on eggshells, trying to stick to text-only prompts just to keep things moving.\n\nTo be real, I’m only here because the competitors' UX just doesn't hit the same. Perplexity fits my use case perfectly. However, stealthily rolling out limitations on basic features like file uploads stuff that fundamentally breaks a user's workflow is honestly frustrating.\n\nI’ve got a year’s worth of my life and data integrated into this platform.

My use has always been paid, starting when I was doing an MA, it proved so good when I graduated I upgraded to Perplexity Enterprise Pro it's not much more a month but has better allowances.\n\nIn my opinion, people really haven't worked out how versatile Perplexity is as an AI model, or the best way to use it effectively. Let's be real it's AI therefore it's imperfect, as all AI is anyway, however one of the biggest surprises I got from Perplexity is its ability to vibe code, and to check the code as it has a sandbox built in.\n\nSpaces with the ability to save files to it, hyperlinks and custom instructions, it's web, files, hyperlinks and Academic search options used correctly together function to help keep the AI on track, I still have to keep an eye out on what it's doing, question things that seem odd, like if it takes a 1000 lines of code file and gives it back edited with only 6-800 lines of code, ask it what happened.\n\nAI (especially Perplexity) is like an extremely competent assistant, it knows more than you do, works faster than you can, Perplexity has access to the latest code changes, workarounds and alternatives through it's research first approach, but it's also like an assistant in that it makes mistakes, forgets information when context grows too big, and isn't always great at understanding your requests.\n\nIt is also a fairly new player in the AI field compared to some, so there are a lot of changes, improvements that at first seem like the opposite, a tapering off of unrealistic unlimited services in comparison to others, they are using a lost leader to become established, this is known marketing not scamming. Once they are established prices go up, otherwise the business model is unsustainable long term.\n\nBottom line, AI is not cheap to devise, run and improve, so it never was going to be a cheap service. It can seem frustrating but technology is that way, use lost leaders to gain traction, and improve constantly to be competitive and that requires money, a lot of it too. AI is becoming a double edged sword, design tools and its use of AI are driving up prices for subscriptions, the hardware required to run local LLMs at any real usable level is extremely expensive.\n\nEssentially once upon a time the gatekeeping obstacle was having a degree to break industries or know the right people, now slowly AI and being able to afford to host it or pay for cloud services is becoming the gatekeeper, so the tool that is supposedly the great leveller, allowing the masses to do things they couldn't before, the caveat is if you can afford it.\n\nThis is where I see the clash of users in this group, there are those who use it for business, pleasure etc they seem ok with Perplexity, and those who are trying to replicate the same thing using free or very cheap services and getting frustrated. Once AI has finally become accepted by most of the people AI will be cheaper and more accessible.\n\nAnyway, back to knowing how to use it, for the fairly low cost of Perplexity Enterprise Pro £36 per month, I get private use meaning no information or materials are used for training it's AI, and higher usage on Deep Research and Labs, I realised after a while using Deep Research for everything was not the best way to use it, in fact quite often it's better using pro search with web and Academic browsing on with the selection of AI that's better at the task than the others available.\n\nThat, and learning to double check, push back and keep a critical eye on what's going on has made it an invaluable tool that other AI doesn't match for personal and business use too, they are not scammers, nor is the product bad in comparison to others, they are just transitioning from loosing so much money to gain customers to reality settling in and the inevitable price hikes, that most people understood were coming.\n\nThe only thing I really do agree on is the way they do it, we find out through usage not through notifications and that is terrible customer service, especially as the main point of contact is an AI chat, Perplexity could easily implement notifications, even if only in app, but they are not scammers, they just have terrible customer service.",

I'm Sam, Perplexity's AI Support Agent.\n\nThanks for reaching out about API credits.\n\nThe monthly API credit grant for Pro users was a time-limited benefit that has been discontinued as of 2/12.\n\nYour Pro subscription benefits remain fully active, including:\n\n10x citations per answer for greater reference depth and transparency\n\nExtended access to Perplexity Research for deeper explorations\n\nEnhanced image generation\n\nYou can learn more about all Pro benefits here: https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/10352901-what-is-perplexity-pro\n\nAPI access is available separately through our API pricing plans.

It describes a dishonest act where someone takes unfair advantage financially or creatively, making the victim feel cheated or robbed. In a consumer context, it specifically refers to the diminished value of a transaction. If I pay $20 for \"Feature A\" and you switch it to \"Feature B\" tomorrow without asking, the \"theft\" is the loss of the value I originally agreed to purchase.",

That's nearly doubled in like few months or so.\n\nNot only the price hike - they also slashed the deep research limit from 250 queries per DAY down to 20 per MONTH. Do the math on that. That's going from 7,500/month to 20/month. For MORE money.\n\nI'm a grad student and I was using this tool constantly for literature reviews and research. Now I have to decide if each query is \"worth it\" because I might run out before the month ends. Downright silly.\n\nI understand they need to make money, but this feels like a bait and switch. Get people hooked on the generous limits, then slowly pull the rug out while raising prices....\n\nProlly gonna cancel when this month runs out. The value just isn't there anymore at this price point with these restrictions.",

They tried to grow their user base to boost their market cap and market value and secure an exit, and they did so exponentially. \n\nThe difference is that ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok grew their user bases organically, meaning people actually found value in them and paid for them. Gemini gives students Gemini AI Pro, which has countless more features and usage limits than perplexity , and Gemini offers a student plan for 12 months free. But the Perplexity student plan isn't even free; it's a discounted plan.\n\nThe problem is that the free annual subscription is given to so many people, and those people also took advantage of it, due to Perplexity’s mismanagement to increase users. Now they're running out of funds because of computing costs and the cost of running all of this, since every single search you do is costing Perplexity money due to all the models they have. \n\n\nIt's all their fault at the end of the day. This is why ChatGPT doesn't just give out ChatGPT Plus annual free subscriptions and promotions: they know the cost. In fact, only 20% of AI users are paid users in ChatGPT, the same with Gemini, Grok, and Claude.",

Google AI Pro provides one of the best models and is $20/month, but they might still be offering the one-year trials to students, so check that out too.",
