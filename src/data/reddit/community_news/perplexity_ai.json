It used to be 600 a day and the limit would never change, which I did always think was really strange. But now mine changed to like 20 a month\n\nI honestly really think a real limit is necessary, but 20 a month is really, really low... could we at least get like 10 a day, or even 5 a day? I hope you will listen to users on this because I bet the research has gotten even better, but I want to be able to use it at an actually reasonable limit",

One request in Opus used up 50% of my five-hour limit, and the remaining 50% was enough for four more requests. Today, I returned to Codex High, worked intensively on my application all evening, and my limits were not exhausted, there were about 20 heavy requests. There is no point in using a Claude Code subscription for less than $100 per month, which is why there are such restrictions on Perplexity. But 20 requests is ridiculous in any case.",

But if there is a monthly limit now I would not blame people for canceling their subscriptions. Maybe they use research lite which uses Sonar by default and you get 20 normal research or maybe research advanced prompts per month also if they set a very strict limit on the number of searches a day, users will not be able to use, as their primary web browser anymore because normal web searches would be perplexity searches and quickly exhaust their quota.",

Sure, ChatGPT might offer the same for their plus tier but they offer higher context window with GPT5.2 thinking and 3000 queries per week for that. They offer many more features that Perplexity tried to imitate and doesn’t do as well. \n\nRight now it seems like Gemini AI pro is the best option in the mid tier subscriptions due to the context window, usage limits, the 2TB of cloud storage, and giving you 25 deep research queries per day. Googles web indexing is unmatched and they have improved their deep research rapidly that it’s even better than Perplexity pro imo. \n\nPerplexity at its core is a search engine but with a chatbot and nice UI. Its search first and Chabot second. \n\nThis is so shady and manipulative from them. And they’re to blame for it all cuz they gave away free annual promotions and subscriptions left and right like it’s candy. And they did this just to increase their user base and market cap. \n\nThey won’t survive another 2 years if they continue like this. And they tried to imitate ChatGPT and Gemini with all the features they added in the past 6 months. But disregard and neglected wha made them different and better in the first pace: their web search and deep research. \n\nPro feels like the new free tier and Max is like what pro was exactly a year ago. \n\n$200USD/month just doesn’t justify the Max tier in any shape or form since again, the long memory sucks, context window is 32K and nothing changed but more usage limits. You really get nothing. \n\nAt this point having ChatGPT plus, Gemini AI Pro, and Claude Max (the $100 one) is a much better stack and deal.",

I split the test into two phases:\n\n * Phase 1 (Standard): I asked the question directly without any additional instructions.\n\n * Phase 2 (Prompt Engineering): I used specific instructions telling the AI to think much more deeply, utilize a significantly higher number of sources, and prioritize these new instructions over all else.\n\nThe Results\n\n| Feature | Standard Response | Engineered Prompt |\n|---|---|---|\n| Length | Normal (a few paragraphs) | Much longer (multiple sections) |\n| Source Count | 11 sources | 18 sources |\n| Quality | Good, standard output | Exhaustive and deep |\n\n\nMy Conclusion\n\nI’ve concluded that by spending a little more time on prompt design, I can develop a \"template\" to use as a prefix for any question requiring deep research.\nWhile it is certainly less convenient than a \"one-click\" deep search button, but it work.",

In order to update the text inside the app, they have to submit an app update to Apple and wait for it to be approved.\n\nThe new advanced deep research is powered by Opus 4.5, so it costs a considerable amount of more money to run than the previous Deep Research, which I believe was run via a Chinese OSS model.\n\nI believe that once you exhaust the advanced research quota it falls back to the previous version of Research.\n\nBut this is very confusing, Perplexity should have just waited for a chance to be able to push an app update before pushing the new Advanced research.",

Perplexity is clearly leaning into “serious research tool” territory with stuff like Deep Research, Labs and now Model Council, and those workflows are brutally expensive to run at scale.\n\nPersonally I would rather pay for a Max tier that keeps these power features healthy than play the game of “unlimited” on a cheap plan and then watch everything get quietly nerfed into uselessness. If Model Council stays fast, reliable and honest about limits, that is worth real money to me.",

      "text": "For starters, if you see me get banned or this post removed, you will understand the kind of damage control the employees and moderators of Perplexity have been doing all along. I have DMed and received DMs from multiple people who previously made posts criticizing a certain service and questioning why these issues were happening to them. Shortly after, their posts were removed and they were permanently banned from this sub.\n\nBefore coming to the issue of Deep Research being reduced, it is necessary to point out that the company’s scummy behavior began with the deliberate rerouting of models.\n\n1. Re-routing\n\nIn the past, the model was silently rerouted to inferior and cheaper alternatives. For those who do not understand the chart below, the network requests can be easily tracked using a variety of tools, as the model name is included in the request payload.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95aku8o6biig1.png?width=1655&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9ddaaf7d244c200faf267ef8467a692dc7732eb\n\nOne such example:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/266cgpurbiig1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=476d9a82c8f232b373991f7b4a38e05296f97973\n\n2. Thorttling Answers\n\nAfter this, the issue was supposedly fixed by showing a prompt at the end stating that the model had been rerouted due to unavailability. However, we then started seeing severely degraded answer quality, even for Pro users, who appeared to be throttled.\n\n3. Image Generation being Reduced.\n\nEven for Pro users, image generation, which was supposedly “unlimited,” was throttled. We began seeing monthly limitations, and image generation was eventually geo-blocked to specific locations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q2gdfheodiig1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e87f952c29b0b6bab57b82930bb8efdd5f9f4e4\n\n4. Deep-Research\n\nFor starters, Deep Research is listed as unlimited in the “Select your plan” section.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fevlkigxdiig1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=765ac33f5a438dbf9d5a3d5fda186b51be49700b\n\nHowever, the real scumminess of the company becomes apparent when you look deeper into the terms and conditions. For example, around August, Deep Research was supposed to be limited to 500 queries per day.\n\nPro queries were also supposed to be unlimited, as shown in the image below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lb7e62wveiig1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fe1df3acb6b25b138af5fc714b27332c6061fbd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7b84kza9eiig1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=738d9daac9fe42d48ce9f36c15ec0d554f729c53\n\nHowever, both have now been throttled and reduced, effectively scamming their customers, especially those who pay for Pro annually, by deliberately changing the terms of their contract midway, which is arguably illegal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cyk4amnteiig1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=78b51cc0c881ee4c8582047c168a3efd12bdb6c1\n\nThe webpages have been changed, but they previously stated that Deep Research was unlimited. For some reason, the Wayback Machine is unable to fetch the page at that URL.\n\nI hope Perplexity stops this scamming behavior for the better, or that someone buys the company and turns it around or there are better alternatives.",

Perplexity seems to be rolling this out to the pro users right now (it was indicated that it is a newer version of DR in the selection modal), the newer deep research powered by Sonnet 4.5. I decided to see how it performs against the above two. The prompt I gave it is in the links.\nBefore we proceed, here's some data about sources browsed/output length\n\nChatgpt Deep research - 18 sources, 89 searches, 11 minutes, roughly just over 1100 tokens\n\nGemini Deep research - roughly 3500 tokens, close to 100 ish sources\n\nPerplexity Deep research - 5555 tokens roughly, 98 sources browsed\n\nLinks to answers, incase you don't want to take my word and do you own evals\n\nChatgpt Deep research report - https://chatgpt.com/share/69878a57-e1cc-8012-80b1-5faf5a39d4b2\n\nGemini Deep research report - https://gemini.google.com/share/a6201a2acf9a\n\nPerplexity - https://www.perplexity.ai/search/deep-research-task-android-fla-sTIHXB.OTAaC4fvbYREINA?preview=1#0\n\nI will now rank the results I got on different axes\n\nFirst, based on accuracy/quality (most important)\n\nNow, I won't be too harsh on Antutu/Geekbench scores, since these benchmarks results might vary and some level of variance is expected. If they are in the ballpark of what multiple credible sources show, it is acceptable. Same goes for stuff like video game FPS benchmarks/Screen time numbers too. For not complicating this too much, let's consider sources like gsmarena/phonearena as highest quality sources with proper testing data.\n\nChatgpt -  Clearly making up stuff about blind camera tests conducted by MKBHD. The last camera test he did was in late 2023. Wrongly surfs those old sources, gets ELO scores for ancient models like pixel 7a and oneplus 11 (it's 2026 man) and shows it as results for latest models. Hallucinations of this level is not acceptable. Shows wrong PWM values for oneplus 13 (2160 Hz is correct, not 4160 hz). Wrong charging wattage shown for pixel 10 pro, 10 pro is capped at 30W. Not 37-40W. Quality of answer is definitely not the best, worked for 11 minutes and only compared 2 phones.\n\nGemini - Gemini failed big time at following instructions (which we will discuss below) - which in turn affected the answer too. A place where Gemini made a big blunder, same as chatgpt, wrongly shows that MKBHD conducted blind camera tests in 2025/2026? And is showing some ELO scores for camera performances which we can't even verify? If you people can verify it, please comment down below. But coming to the overall quality, Gemini is just all over the place. For Antutu benchmarks, it compared S26 ultra (which is not even released, I clearly mentioned phones released in the last few months) vs Pixel 10 pro Xl. Then, added two more phones with the above two to the mix while comparing brightness/PWM, and showed wrong PWM values for the Xiaomi 17 ultra. Gemini also shows that 10 pro XL holds industry record for usable brightness? I have seen multiple other phones with more nits at peak brightness. Doubt ( a search shows its currently motorola signature, 6200 nits peak). Next, for the camera comparison, it added iphone 17 pro to the mix when i specifically asked for androids only. It should just pick a set of phones and not keep changing it in between comparison.\n\nPerplexity - GPU stress test for Pixel 10 pro is wrongly shown. As per GSM, pixel 10 pro performs decent in this benchmark, scoring around 70%. Perplexity shows it as 40% for some reason. Perplexity also shows auto brightness and a separate peak brightness category, which are not the same, (heads up not to get confused). Debatable between brightness comparison of pixel 10 pro vs s25 ultra, some say its pixel and others say its s25 ultra, so won't be deducting points here. But the important thing to note here - atleast it doesn't make up fake ELO scores based on imaginary tests like the other two deep research. It clearly clarified that that MKBHD camera blind test was last made in 2023 and instead gave whatever truthful info it got from web. Point to perplexity here, I think it is definitely more accurate than the other two.\n\nGenshin/Antutu/Geekbench/SOTs tests are compiled from many different sources, I manually checked each and every number and for all three DR, they're more or less in the ballpark of legit values. Feel free to correct in comments\n\nNow let's compare the results based on following instructions/better UI-UX:\n\nI clearly mention in my prompt that inline images + sources ARE a must. And that the phone had to be released in the last 6 months (not any unreleased phones) + android only\n\nGemini - worst in following instructions. I have used this DR a bit before, but not that much. I'm not sure if they support inline images/inline citations (definitely poor UX, since the other two do it. Needing inline citations is a must for quick fact checks). But the most important part - it keeps throwing S26 ultra in the mix when I only asked for already released phones? S26 ultra is set to release this month, it SHOULD not be in this report. Yes, I know there's benchmark values reported for S26 ultra (like those spotted on geekbench) , but best if taken with a pinch of salt. Points deducted for not following, also taking into fact that it even compared iphones with android phones. Not good.\n\nChatgpt - Better than Gemini, inline images + citations shown for table values. Showed only android phones as per my filters.\n\nPerplexity - Followed instructions the best, showed phones as per my filters, inline images and citations (for easier number verifications). But have to give instruction following ranking #1 to Perplexity as well, since I specifically asked it to compare major brands, and it did show multiple phones. Chatgpt started out fine, researching multiple phones and switched up midway and just showed results for 2 phones. Not great instruction following, but definitely better than Gemini since it did not show rumoured S26 ultra data/iPhone comparisons, neither did Perplexity.\n\nOverall rankings\n\n#1 - Perplexity clearly has lesser factual inaccuracies (I'm not saying it is 100% error free, there are some places where the info is stale/incorrect, like showing stale info about oneplus still having alert sliders in latest models) - but it is atleast TRUTHFUL and does not make up imaginary ELO scores. Shows whatever it got from browsing. Follows my instructions much better than the other two. Showed much more interesting benchmark data too inside a visual and comprehensive report. Yes, I know we can't decide quality based on output length alone, but this was better factually too. Could have shown more RAM data though.\n\n#2 - Chatgpt. Even though it was very lazy in it's work, comparing only 2 phones, compared to Gemini, it did follow better instructions and showed inline images/citations. Both hallucinated a bit more, but giving this to chatgpt deep research.\n\n#3 - Gemini. Did not follow my instructions, shows much more hallucinated/wrong info. Maybe comparable to chatgpt in terms of wrong stuff shown, but this answer was not what I was looking for.\n\nFeel free to do your own research and comment down below. \n\nEdit 1 - A user was kind enough to [point](https://www.reddit.com/r/perplexity_ai/comments/1qyo0rf/comment/o4adrgr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) out to use thinking/pro on gemini DR to get better instruction following and lesser hallucinations. [Ran](https://gemini.google.com/share/a6f8d3deed78) the same prompt again.Maybe better at mentioning only phones released in the last 6 months, following instructions better, but got very low quality information, as usual, just like before when I ran DR with fast.

Also, you should always check the plan it generates to verify if understands what type of data you really need.\n\n\nYou said it kept mentioning Galaxy S26, but in the plan it specifically said it would. In the FIRST line actually. You should have edited the plan before proceeding, but you either didn't care to read it or you didn't care for accuracy.\n\nAlso, maybe I missed it, but I don't think you mentioned which model did you use. By default it uses Gemini Flash, which makes quicker Researches but way less accurately. If you choose Thinking or Pro you will usually get much better data.\n\n\nIf you use it the same way you're used to with Perplexity research it obviously will not work as it should. Each service offer a different system to deal with, and simply replicating the same prompt is not a good way to benchmark.\n\n\nIf you want a good benchmark for research, set an objective: what data you actually need? Then understand how each of these system work and try to make the best out of it. And THEN compare the results.\n\n\nAlso, asking it to format the output won't help the research process. You can ask for it format the data later, in a non-research environment.\n\n\nIt almost surprises me to see people here (if not bots) saying that it is good information. This benchmark is lazy to say the least, if it wasn't made misleading on purpose.",

So run another one?? im saying this not as a dck but to highlight things for clarity, this test doesn't show what's better at all.",

The notifications are too much and clearly paid for.\n\n3. You can no longer switch models on the app to a different LLM. They are scraping all your data with that app, so the app should have more features not less. Regardless whenever you can use the website, use it. Apps ask for too much data about you. They made the mobile app so unusable\n\n4. Instead of increasing cap size, they made it smaller to sell more max subscriptions. I hope they lose all actual paying subscribers like me.\n\n5.

The advantage of perplexity was searching for sources, and that's it. All these models are of little significance because they are more of an addition to searching. They used to be a great choice because no one else was delivering such results, but today many other models are very good at searching for sources on the internet.

Did the same before in different spaces as an aid since I do study. However, I hit a limit last night for the first time ever and now seeing on Reddit all over that I’m not alone makes me wonder what’s going on. I also couldn’t get docx generated and delivered for some specific summaries from a pdf uploaded books like I did few weeks ago without any problems. It’s the last 2 or 3 weeks that weird stuff started happening and it’s escalating. \nI mean I tried ‘best’ but it’s a hit and miss for accuracy, ‘research’ is about 95% or has been for me after a ton of back and forth with it until I set it up right. Using actual one extensive prompt hasn’t worked well for me yet since my content is complex and requires tailored approach per course. I tried so many things and just wasted my time on it. Training it works wonderful but not I hit a limit in 10 days and I literally didn’t even use it past the setting up prompts that gave me results that were on point. So ya….i keep going on about it but I’m frustrated as they broke it while it actually worked quite well after training.\n\nPeople will say use Claude but each textbook is 900 pages plus additional materials. And no I don’t write papers with it but I do get one page generated  for keys to expand on academically myself since I’m making a point to limit use of references and citations and write from comprehension alone. I’m kinda challenging the system for demanding huge research based papers for MBA’s while comprehension and practical approach should be more valued from my exp and opinion hahaha…pain in the arzz \n\nGemini isn’t nearly as good to me even tho I have it. Works so so, accuracy is way on the 60s% no matter what I do to it. Even with ENI or custom prompts. Plus the nuance things is pretty sadly misunderstood.",

And they are investigating and trying to find out... Maybe they're losing money on compute?...\n\nSo they're trying to do a lot of different things to control... And they are a startup, so they're probably cutting corners everywhere cuz they don't have enough people... They don't understand about brand management... And pissing people off... Yesterday suddenly I lost the pro and then I had to add my credit card, and then it came back... And I think after that I'm seeing that I only have 20 deep research queries left...🤷🏽‍♂️\n\nI'm signed up through the promo... I think a lot of people who signed up through the promo are having problems, maybe they realized, they're losing a lot of money on the promo... And throttling those people",

This is not about users signing up for legitimate, public-facing offers like the PayPal or SheerID one-year free trials.\n\nThe Teardown\n\n> Perplexity gave out promotions to everyone and their grandma.\n\nThere is a massive legal and ethical chasm between a company running a public marketing campaign and a group of users exploiting a leaked administrative bypass. \"Grandma\" getting a public discount doesn't justify you using a backdoor meant for developers or internal testing.\n\n> What people are doing (if so at a large scale) is not right but knowing the amount of users that have violated this would help justify the amount of effort going for the users.\n\nScaling a violation doesn’t turn it into a virtue. This is the \"everyone else is doing it\" fallacy; the number of people exploiting a leak doesn't \"justify\" the effort, it just creates a larger mess for the engineers to clean up.\n\n> Their platform seems so damn stale and could use a few minor touches to make it so damn good.\n\nIf the platform is \"stale,\" it is incredibly contradictory to go through the mental gymnastics of exploiting leaked codes to get it for free. If the product isn't worth the money, the logical response is to use a competitor, not to commit a Terms of Service violation to access something you claim to dislike.\n\n> Granted, I recommended a lot of suggestions to their team and they never provide feedback of reasoning or anything besides stupid Sam bot.\n\nNot getting a personalized \"thank you\" note for your feature requests does not grant you a license to circumvent a company’s billing system. Bad customer service is a reason to take your business elsewhere, not a voucher for digital shoplifting.\n\n> Also, they're scummy af knowing the amount of lawsuits they're in with large organizations for scraping data, which they do themselves.\n\nA company’s legal disputes regarding data scraping—which is a complex industry-wide debate—is not a \"get out of jail free\" card for individual users to violate their user agreement. Using a company's perceived \"scummy\" behavior to justify your own exploitation is peak moral equivalence.\n\n> Along with the sleezy actions of degrading Pro users access without notifying users. They upgraded most of their documentation to cover up areas where it was showing the services they promised.\n\nIf you believe a company is in breach of contract, the appropriate remedy is a refund, a credit card chargeback, or a cancellation. Responding to a \"breach of contract\" by exploiting a leaked internal code is not a remedy; it’s just another violation that kills your standing as a \"wronged\" customer.\n\n> They breached their contract with Pro users and the amount of users is substantial. It appears to be a continuous behavior by Perplexity of unethical leadership.\n\nIf you truly believe the leadership is unethical and the contract is broken, the most impactful protest is to stop using the service entirely. Continuing to use the product while bypassing the paywall suggests you actually find the tool quite valuable, despite the moral posturing.\n\n> Imagine being an employee and knowing your employer was doing this type of shady business.\n\nImagine being a developer working late to fix bugs and improve features, only to watch a segment of the \"community\" leak internal administrative overrides to avoid paying for the very work you're doing.",

If you didn’t like the service or feel it’s not worth paying for then complaining that your unauthorized free usage got revoked is pretty childish.   I wouldn’t even admit that if it was myself.   Lucky they don’t press charges.   Just because you find a way to use something without paying doesn’t mean the company turned the other cheek.   And it could have been the massive abuse thru the leak that finally made them crack down.   The people who like perplexity will pay.

It is what it is, but I think the bullshit elitist attitude is ridiculous. \n\nYou got your access via the intended, preferred path. Good for you. I am glad that you found value in the platform so much that you continue to use it as a paying consumer. And I hope that Perplexity continues to treat your patronage with the respect it deserves because you pay them to be the tool/service/platform that serves your needs.\n\nMy issue with the way Perplexity has handled this matter on 2 fronts. The first is their \"scorched earth\" tactic; they suspended accounts, valid as well as invalid. They contributed to this problem, & they inconvenienced & punished accounts that they themselves gave via promotions with other parties. That is lazy & terrible customer service. The legit accounts did not deserve that kind of treatment.\n\nThe second reason ties directly to the title of the post. The reason given is a vague violation of the Terms of Service. And yes, I read them. At the time (prior to the most recent version dated January 2026), there was no language about the promotions or codes being sold, shared, or anything of that sort. As such, Perplexity simply failed to account for such a thing happening at all, let alone at scale, within their Terms. That entire section is new (I believe the update prior to January was last July) which I am sure is due to everything that has happened.\n\nWhile the notice I received presented a way to reach out if it was believed that the suspension was in error, the response stated that the decision was final with no way to review any further. The main crux, however, was the lack of reason given. I asked repeatedly for the explicit violation that went against the Terms; nothing was given. It makes the whole process seem arbitrary rather than deliberately calculated which it should be. If rules are broken, then state the violation. The problem with that? Until late January of this year, there was nothing that spoke to the way accounts were being activated.\n\nThis is not me complaining about my account being downgraded from Pro; I accept that fully as somewhat inevitable. I just resent it being done arbitrarily & impacting accounts that did not warrant that treatment. And I resent users turning their noses up at other users who didn't necessarily do things right. You don't know their circumstances or reasons, not that it justifies what they did or how they did it. If you downvote, downvote. I'm not here for your approval; I'm here to add a different perspective to the discussion. And that perspective is that companies need to be as accountable for the exploitation of their guidelines as the consumers.",

Good for you.\"\n\nFollowing the intended path isn’t elitism; it’s the basic social contract of commerce. When you pay for a service instead of using a leaked internal code, you aren’t being an \"elitist\"—you are being a customer. Bypassing the checkout line because you think the price is too high isn't a \"perspective,\" it’s theft of services.\n\n\\> \"Perplexity simply failed to account for such a thing happening at all, let alone at scale, within their Terms.\"\n\nThis is pure entitlement. A grocery store doesn't need a sign specifically saying \"Don't use a photocopied coupon you found in a dumpster\" for you to know it’s wrong. Theft of services is covered under general unauthorized access. You don’t need a specific clause to know that buying a subscription from a \"shady guy on Discord\" is a violation of the service agreement.\n\n\\> \"The response stated that the decision was final with no way to review any further... It makes the whole process seem arbitrary.\"\n\nThere is nothing arbitrary about it. They identified accounts activated via fraud and closed them. Companies are not obligated to provide a multi-step appeals process for people who didn't actually pay them. If you didn't buy the product from the vendor, you aren't a \"customer\"—you are a trespasser on their infrastructure.\n\n\\> \"I just resent it being done arbitrarily... And I resent users turning their noses up at other users who didn't necessarily do things right.\"\n\nPeople \"turn their noses up\" because exploitation increases costs for everyone else. When people abuse promo codes, it forces companies to kill legitimate promotions and raise prices for the people actually paying the bills. You aren't being judged for your \"circumstances\"; you are being called out for the entitlement of feeling you deserve a premium AI tool without compensating the people who build it.\n\n\\> \"Companies need to be as accountable for the exploitation of their guidelines as the consumers.\"\n\nThe company is being accountable—to its developers and paying users—by shutting down theft. Accountability means facing the consequences of your actions. If you use a leaked code, you lose the account. That is the system working exactly as it should.",

Why people use stolen codes and then publicly complain they got caught is beyond me.

I have a Pro subscription bundled with my Revolut plan, and I used to like using Perplexity, especially for deep research and Labs, because when used alongside other AIs they often complemented each other well, or I used it to cross-check them. There were also projects where Perplexity simply performed better than other AIs I use.\n\nAt the moment, I’m working as a favor for an acquaintance on a website. It’s a simple, static HTML page, and I thought I’d just do it in Perplexity Labs, but then suddenly a notification popped up saying that I’d run out of my quota — which until now had felt practically unlimited.\n\nFor me, Perplexity is dead. The only thing keeping me there is the Revolut plan.\nFrom the moment Revolut removes it from their offering, or I cancel my Revolut plan and no longer have a Pro subscription on Perplexity, that’s the end of the story for me.\n\nI can also imagine that Perplexity overcommitted itself. Basically, a lot of things run on Perplexity under the hood.\nFor example, in Hungary the “Telekom AI” also runs on Perplexity. I assume this also consumes resources. Just like the Revolut integration. That also eats up resources.\nAnd many other things.\n\nBut users shouldn’t be the ones punished for this. Instead, they should invest in new resources, or take on fewer commitments.",

The real test will be retention once those subscriptions expire.\nThe challenge they’re facing is that users can now access the actual frontier models (Claude, GPT-5, etc.) directly from the developers themselves. And these direct integrations often come with better features - like Claude’s artifacts, advanced voice mode, or various IDE extensions for coding. When you can get the source models with superior tooling, it’s hard to justify staying with an intermediary.\nTheir in-house models also aren’t competitive with the leading options from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, or even some of the top Chinese labs. So they’re essentially a UI layer over other companies’ APIs rather than offering unique model capabilities.\nDon’t get me wrong - Perplexity has built a clean search-focused interface. But I’m curious whether that alone will be enough to retain paying customers long-term when the free trials end.",

But if Google would change their One accounts from 2TB to 200MB keeping the price the same for sure there would be a shitstorm on the web, and definitely not from the \"whiners who work for the competition\"\n\nAlso I'm not sure you'd be happy, when they would strip your max subscription to limits from pro, and introduce new Max x10 or Ultra for 10x the current price with the current features, as a part of \"rotation\".",

Google *did* pay refunds not just for subscription costs but for physical hardware - game controllers - to customers when they killed Stadia even though they were fully functioning devices still in customers’ possession that kept working perfectly with third-party devices and services.\n\nDisclaimer: I do not work for the competition.\n\n",

You subscribed on Feb 4, the feature was downgraded within the same week, and the refund window expired before the downgrade occurred. This is clean.\n\n2. **If you're in the EU, UK, or Australia, you have statutory consumer rights that override any company's internal refund policy.** A material change to a digital service post-purchase triggers refund obligations regardless of what their terms say.

          "text": "**Fellow Europeans, let’s take action! Our consumer rights are being violated. Here is how to report Perplexity.**\n\n\"Guys, there are millions of us in Europe—it’s time to make our voices heard and enforce our rights. I have personally filed a formal complaint with the Antitrust Authority and the European Consumer Centre (ECC). I urge every EU citizen to do the same!\n\nRemember: **Terms of Service (ToS) do not override European Law.** Furthermore, even if we signed up through a promotion, the service is **not** 'free'. Under EU law (Directive 2019/770), when you provide your personal data in exchange for a digital service, you are 'paying' with that data, and you are entitled to the same protections as a paying customer.\n\n**To my fellow Italians:** Contact the **AGCM (Antitrust)** via PEC here:[https://www.agcm.it/segnala-online/index](https://www.agcm.it/segnala-online/index)\n\n**To all EU citizens:** Write to the **European Consumer Centre**. You can find the contact details for your specific country here:[https://www.eccnet.eu/contact-your-local-ecc](https://www.eccnet.eu/contact-your-local-ecc)\n\nFor reference, here is the text I sent (translated into English for you to adapt):\n\n> I am reporting Perplexity INC. for unfair commercial practices regarding their 'Pro' subscription. This 12-month promotion (offered through partnerships with third parties like PayPal or mobile carriers) guaranteed access to specific features, such as dedicated image generation models and a set number of 'Deep Research' queries per day. ​Following the activation of the service, the company unilaterally and drastically reduced or removed these essential features. This has stripped the 'Pro' offer of its core value, making the service non-compliant with what was advertised at the time of signup. ​I believe this conduct constitutes a misleading commercial practice under the Consumer Code. Users were induced to sign up based on promises that were not kept, and the contract terms were worsened without any prior notice\n\n\nLet’s stand up for our rights. Don't let them get away with the 'bait-and-switch'! 🇪🇺",

This is what is holding them back. They aren't making money on the free subscriptions or the Pro users who want thousands of dollars worth of product for $20 a month. That was their mistake from the get-go. Everyday, as in *every day,* I get an \"update to my ToS\" from every major and minor online service with huge changes from fees to services now offered, let alone my privacy and data. This does not bother you in the slightest. People got Perplexity Pro free either because they were students with no life experience, or they they were parasites scamming the site. It was becoming out of hand and for someone like me who pays for Max and loves it becaue subsidizing the whiners isn't cool. I hope their C-Suite learned a lesson: people will never be grateful for a gift. They will become tyrannical and entitled and demand more.",
