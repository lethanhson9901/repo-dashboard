Trying to cover their losses by loading up Max with features and pushing it hard as hell. Ultimately, I think they are just having a really tough year financially since they are giving away so much of their services for absolutely free, but once the 12 month promo period is over, I am thinking the cash will start to come in, and hopefully things start to get a bit more reasonable.\n\nAlso, I believe Comet was originally a Max / Pro only feature, right?

The comment essentially said they wouldn’t recommend a yearly plan. Mentioned changing limits, shared that they personally switched to another AI tool. Advised others to be cautious.\n\nIf that comment violates a specific community rule then it should be straightforward to explain which rule. How? So I’m asking the moderators\n\nWhich exact community rule was violated?\n\nWhat specific sentence or behavior triggered the permanent ban?\n\nWas any warning issued before the ban?\n\nIs there an appeal process?\n\nThis is not about one user. It seems like this is ultimately about moderation standards and consistency.\n\nPerplexity\\_ai moderators have stated that this subreddit is not affiliated with the company. If that’s the case hen moderation decisions should be transparent and grounded in clearly defined rules.\n\nCritical posts often get heavily downvoted very quickly. Praise posts rise fast. That may be organic. It may not be. But when bans follow criticism without clear explanation it creates the perception that dissent isn’t welcome here.\n\nThis is a simple request for clarity. If the rule violation is clear and objective posting the explanation would settle this immediately. ",

Well, this isn’t bad, they seem to have completely abandoned their original customer base which makes me question the credibility. Also, the fact that a few months ago, they were touting off on here or discord about being transparent about their business practices, and now they’ve been radio silent since the rate changes says a lot. Like you said, it’s business but it’s a shitty business practice and I don’t trust a business that is doing what they do. They might be the best dad doing deep research right now, but the other companies with much more financing behind them are going to catch up.",

I was frustrated by them, too.\n\nTo help out, I’ve put together a **workaround**, an **alternative**, if you will, to get that **original Research Mode** experience back without the heavy restrictions. I’ve explained the steps below. Let me know if this helps you! :)\n\n1. Create a new **Space** and name it \"**Research**\" (or anything else if you want). We will be using this Space for Research.\n2. In this space, add the following **custom instructions**:\n\n*<role>You are a deep research agent. Your goal is to produce a long, comprehensive, well-structured research report answering the user's query. Mimic expert human research: plan, search deeply, verify facts, analyze, and synthesize.</role>*\n\n\n\n*<process>*\n\n*1. Analyze the query: Break it into subtopics. Identify key questions, ambiguities, and research needs.*\n\n*2. Create a research plan: List numerous specific searches or tool calls.*\n\n*2.5. Maximize sources: Aim for 20-50 total sources. Allocate quotas per step/subtopic. Track unique sources to avoid duplication.*\n\n*3. Execute iteratively: Use tools to search, read pages. For each step, reason: What did I learn? Gaps? Next action? Refine plan as needed.*\n\n*4. Verify: Cross-reference facts from 20+ sources. Note contradictions. Use code tools for data analysis/math if relevant.*\n\n*5.

It sounds like it really was your error and should have researched a bit about usage and how to avoid burning through tokens without anything useful. After reading various posts and threads, it’s apparent that good instructions make it all happen and to get the results you want. \n\nI uploaded some instructions that I use in spaces as they were relevant to what I was doing. I then asked the chatbot (not computer) to help build a solid set of instructions with some back and forth and discussion about exactly what I wanted. It created an excellent prompt/instructions to build what i need. I then took that prompt, put it into computer but instructed it to evaluate the prompt but not run it. It guided me through a couple of recommended changes to get better results.  \n\nThat process took less than 30 minutes. Once I was satisfied, I told it to execute the prompt with the recommended changes. It created a manual that was around 150 pages long, included our headers and footers with the right sized text, titles…everything. It created it all in a word document. I am going through it all now but have only had to make very minor edits to better align with our org. With the sized of this project with research and creating the files on your template woukd have taken weeks to complete. It finished it in 45 minutes total. Had everything in a zip file and is exactly the results I had hoped for. \n\nSo, if you haven’t used up your 30k, try this method and spend some time working on it. You’ll get better results and what you are looking for.",

The CEO admitted it, called it a bug, and they fixed it. You can debate whether \"\"bug\"\" is the right word or if it was a cost-cutting decision that got exposed, but either way, users had a right to be upset about that. Transparency matters.\n\nThe rate limit complaints are a completely different thing and I think people are using the (justified) anger from the model switching issue to fuel complaints about hitting query caps. These aren't the same problem. One is about deception. The other is about people wanting unlimited access to expensive AI models for the price of a Chipotle burrito bowl. Every AI subscription has limits. ChatGPT throttles heavy users. Claude has message caps. The fact that Perplexity has limits too isn't evidence of anything shady.

Using one of the daily *Pro searches* in the free tier, I asked it to fact-check something about Thomas Barrack (U.S. Ambassador to Türkiye), and it told me that he isn't and has never been the Ambassador. \n\nThe embassy's website, state.gov, and his appointment on congress.gov say elsewise. \n\nWhen I presented it with the link where the info is stated (https://tr.usembassy.gov/ambassador/), it told me that isn't the embassy in Türkiye's official website, which is \"https://tr.usembassy.gov\" (apparently the \"/ambassador/\" makes it an entirely different domain 😂). When I pointed this out, it tried to convince me that the government sites must have been hacked or cloned 😂\n\nSo I shared screenshots from these actual US institutional websites as proof: It told me they seemed fake, and presented a list of visual cues that proved they were low-quality clone sites 😂\n\n15' worth of hallucinating and gaslighting until it finally admitted that its info is out of date & from 2021.\n\nAnd this was using its *Pro Search*, which supposedly utilizes \"Multi-Step Research\".\n\nI tried on ChatGPT, ClaudeAI, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek & European-based Le Chat (Mistral AI) and they ALL got it right, so it beats me what 4th-tier model Perplexity used.\n\n\nI tried ClaudeAI (Sonnet 4.6) with \"web search\" off and it still did a better job than Perplexity. The ONLY way I was able to get results as bad as Perplexity's was using Anthropic's most basic model (Haiku 4.5) with \"web search\" turned off.\n\n\nThis was my very first experience with Perplexity, and what led me to Google its issues, discover the model switching scandal and ultimately end up here.\n\n\nThis company is as fraudulent as it gets, I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nLike a lot of you, I’ve been feeling pretty rough about the recent changes to Perplexity’s Pro limits. I went from feeling like I had a reliable thinking partner to constantly bumping into invisible walls, and it honestly broke the trust a bit.\n\nI’m not here to rant (we’ve all done plenty of that already), but I do want to acknowledge how valid the frustration is:\n\n* Many of us prepaid for a year based on “unlimited” or very generous usage.\n* The caps tightened quietly, with little/no in-app clarity.\n* There’s no official way to export your conversations or “memories,” which makes leaving (or even just hedging) feel scary.\n\nI’ve hit the limits myself enough times now that I’ve started transitioning away from Perplexity for my serious work. That’s been a painful decision, because a lot of important thinking lives in these threads. Since there’s no built-in export or backup, I wrote a small workaround so you don’t feel completely trapped.\n\nIt’s not perfect, but it’s better than losing everything.\n\n# What this script does\n\n* Exports the current thread’s messages as a Markdown (`.md`) file.\n* Preserves the back-and-forth structure so you can read it later in any editor.\n* Runs entirely in your browser console on a per-thread basis (no external servers, no uploading).\n\nYou do have to:\n\n* Run it once per thread you want to save.\n* Manually change the output filename each time so you don’t overwrite previous exports.\n\nAgain, not ideal, but it gives you an escape hatch and a bit more control over your data.\n\n# How to use it (step-by-step)\n\n1. Open the Perplexity thread you want to export in your browser.\n2. Make sure all messages are fully loaded (scroll to the top so earlier messages render).\n3. Open your browser’s developer console:\n   * Chrome/Edge: Right-click → “Inspect” → go to the “Console” tab.\n   * Firefox: Right-click → “Inspect” → “Console”.\n   * Safari: Enable Developer menu in settings, then “Develop” → “Show JavaScript Console”.\n4. Copy the script below.\n5. Paste it into the console for that thread and press Enter.\n6. A download should start for a `.md` file containing that thread.\n7. Before you run it on the next thread, edit the `filename` in the script so you don’t overwrite the previous file (for example, [`perplexity-thread-1.md`](http://perplexity-thread-1.md), [`perplexity-thread-2.md`](http://perplexity-thread-2.md), etc.).\n\n# The script\n\n    // 1) Grab all assistant message blocks (ai replies) as real arrays\n    const assistantNodes = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\n      'div.prose.dark\\\\:prose-invert.inline.leading-relaxed.break-words.min-w-0'\n    ));\n    \n    // 2) Grab all user message blocks (your messages) as real arrays\n    const userNodes = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\n      'div.min-w-\\\\[48px\\\\].select-none.p-3.bg-subtler.rounded-2xl.flex.items-center.justify-center'\n    ));\n    \n    // 3) Merge into a single timeline based on DOM order (NodeList → Array)\n    const allNodes = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\n      'div.prose.dark\\\\:prose-invert.inline.leading-relaxed.break-words.min-w-0,' +\n      'div.min-w-\\\\[48px\\\\].select-none.p-3.bg-subtler.rounded-2xl.flex.items-center.justify-center'\n    ));\n    \n    // 4) Build transcript\n    const transcript = allNodes.map(n => {\n      let role, text;\n    \n      if (assistantNodes.includes(n)) {\n        role = 'assistant';\n        text = n.innerText.trim();\n      } else if (userNodes.includes(n)) {\n        role = 'user';\n        const span = n.querySelector('span');\n        text = (span ? span.innerText : n.innerText).trim();\n      } else {\n        role = 'unknown';\n        text = n.innerText.trim();\n      }\n    \n      return { role, text };\n    });\n    \n    // 5) Markdown\n    const md = transcript.map(m => {\n      return `### ${m.role}\\n\\n${m.text}\\n`;\n    }).join('\\n\\n---\\n\\n');\n    \n    // 6) Download as .md\n    const blob = new Blob([md], { type: 'text/markdown' });\n    const a = document.createElement('a');\n    a.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n    a.download = '2026-02-22-log.md';\n    document.body.appendChild(a);\n    a.click();\n    document.body.removeChild(a);\n    URL.revokeObjectURL(a.href);\n    \n\n# Why I’m sharing this\n\nI’m leaving Perplexity not because the tech is bad, but because the combination of:\n\n* quietly tightened limits,\n* lack of clarity about what you’re actually paying for,\n* and no official way to take your data with you\n\nmakes it hard to feel safe investing more time and trust here.\n\nIf you’re in the same boat, I hope this at least helps you preserve your work, your notes, and your past conversations so you’re free to explore other tools without losing your history.\n\nIf you improve the script (better filenames, automatic multi-thread export, etc.), please reply and share your version so others can benefit too.\n\nStay kind to yourselves, everyone. This stuff can feel weirdly personal when you’ve poured a lot of thinking into one tool, but your actual *work* doesn’t have to be held hostage.",

      "text": "I was looking through the examples of the newly released \"Perplexity Computer\" feature, which are **curated by the Perplexity team** and I found something hilarious (at least to me) in the [ASCII Canvas Editor Website](https://www.perplexity.ai/computer/live/ascii-canvas-editor-website-k_3KUhUfS5mfJ40w7ymgGA) example.\n\n  \nThe prompt clearly states: *Generate a* ***Rust-based*** *ASCII canvas editor compiled to WASM for web deployment.* \\[...\\]\n\n  \nNotice how I highlighted the fact that it is supposed to be Rust-based? Well guess what, during the thinking process it just decided that Rust wasn't feasible:\n\n>Since Rust/WASM compilation isn't feasible in this sandbox (no wasm-pack/rustc), I'll build the core engine in JavaScript that mimics the architecture of a Rust/WASM module \\[...\\]\n\nIn the end it doesn't even tell the user that it just mimicked the Rust part with a JavaScript module, except if you scroll through the thinking process. I get that rustc isn't the most portable compiler, but then I wonder why they called this feature \"Computer\" if they literally don't even provide a development environment to the LLM. Even if it's just a docker container, it would still work.\n\n  \nTo me it looks like this is just another money-grab by perplexity without any meaningful functionality added except for it being able to run processes in parallel. Especially since it's only available to Max subscribers.",

A couple weeks ago, I discovered the new monthly quota of 20 (?), meaning I had no queries left a week into my monthly cycle.  Now it's working again and the output doesn't mention any quota – so is there still a quota or not? \n\nThe problem now is that the output has become trash. My main use case was to paste a bunch of news headlines, ask it to research those developments, and draft a summary. When you subscribe to an AI service, you expect it to improve over time, but this one has declined dramatically. It often strings headlines into a paragraph without actually performing research ( I need to follow with an explicit ask)...lately the synthesis has been sloppy and forced. \n\nThe output today is the strangest yet, containing introspection about the task itself (\"The  request relies on accessing and reviewing the full content of 30+ specific news articles dated around 20–26 February 2026 to verify exact event dates and synthesise themes...\") followed by a few brief blurbs about the difficulty of accessing the articles. \n\nI'm now using the free GLM-5 chatbot itself, which is certainly better than this (but not as good as Deep Research used to be).

If perplexity decides that their current usage is unsustainable at $20 that's reasonable but then either give people a refund for their remaining time if they want and give advance notice. Why not just do a gradual price increase, or offer a 3 month discount on the max plan, or perhaps offer a middle tier plan? There are a lot of ways they could approach this without having their users find out because they want to do a search and get a popup saying their undisclosed usage allowance is used up.\n\nI am glad I was paying month to month, imagine someone who just signed up for a year of pro for this to happen? This is dishonest. Who wants to deal with dishonest companies? nobody.\n\nI am actually willing to pay the $200 per month as I am subscribed to claude max, and I probably would have paid more for a middle tier of perplexity (not the $200 but $40 sure). I can even understand they need to raise prices to be sustainable, nothing wrong with that; but why the games? Who benefits? Just take a look at their trust pilot reviews, anyone who reads these will never give them a penny. Even looking at it from perplexity's selfish point of view, this is a colossal reputational blunder. \n\nAfter this, I am deleting my perplexity account and never looking back. I won't deal with a company that acts this way. And yes I am complaining publicly, as any consumer in this situation should, because in these situations it's the only power that we have.",

I see these posts every day now and most of them are from people who got a free year through T-Mobile or PayPal or Airtel and are upset that they can't run 300 Deep Research queries a day on a promo account they paid $0 for.\n\nRunning AI models costs real money. Every query you send to Claude or GPT through Perplexity, somebody is paying for those API calls. When you got Pro for free through a carrier deal and you're hammering it all day, you're not a paying customer being wronged — you're someone using a free gift and being surprised it has boundaries. I've been paying for Pro for over a year and my experience has been consistently fine. I don't hit limits because I use it like a normal person — maybe 30-40 queries a day for work stuff. I'm not trying to replace an entire research department with a $20/month subscription.\n\nIf you're genuinely hitting limits on a paid plan doing normal work, that's worth flagging. But half these posts read like \"I ran 200 Deep Research queries before lunch and now it's throttling me, this is fraud.\"",

I don't wanna sound like a hater, cause I'm not, but **what is the point at this point?**\n\nHave you tried Google's AI mode recently? I've been putting my prompts both into Perplexity with Claude Sonnet 4.6 Thinking on and into AI mode for like two weeks to compare them and that shit's great, it's fast, so free you can't pay for it if you wanted to and I never got a worse answer than from Perplexity, sometimes it even adds stuff that Perplexity misses and it does it in 1/10 of the time.\n\nIf you need researching, you're probably going to put those 20€ straight into Gemini, Claude or GPT, you won't pay 20€ to make 20 researches through a wrapper, right? And Gemini can do so much more in Google Drive and in Sheets, Claude can do shit in Excel and whatever, GPT has those Apps, and **AI MODE IS FREE**, what is Perplexity for?\n\nPerplexity has a very nice app for both iOS and MacOS... but like, **what is the point**? I'm not trying to be negative and I understand that prompting the models costs money, but what is the point in spending the money?\n\nI am really asking, I've forced Perplexity onto everyone I know and I feel bad leaving.
