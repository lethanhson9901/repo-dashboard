I tried something similar with a different LLM and found that the research phase alone was taking 3-4 minutes per analysis, which made real-time trading decisions basically impossible. Also curious if you've stress-tested this during high volatility periods – my concern would be that the confirmation loop might introduce too much delay when markets are moving fast.",

I've been using their search for market analysis for almost a year now and the quality of sources they pull for Indian exchanges specifically is leagues ahead of what I get from traditional platforms. The fact that you were able to automate your entire workflow through their MCP integration is wild – most people don't realize how powerful their API access actually is beyond just the chat interface. The real value isn't even the automation itself, it's that Perplexity consistently surfaces relevant financial filings and regional news that other search tools completely miss.",

I highly doubt that perplexity's own models train themselves or are trained by a scraping process you assumed. They are busy mimicing the other models quality while defending against current lawsuits. If you want to see a 'RAG'-quality at perplexity, just use a free account without login on any youtube-URL ;-)",

The new \"Thinking with 3 Pro\" toggle is stronger (responds with cool custom layouts) and AI Overviews are starting to blend with AI Mode. Plus, the Gemini app is finally becoming less clumsy every week.\n\nBut I’m still figuring out where the overlap ends.\n\nGemini hallucinates a lot with its outdated training data. For example, as you discuss the AI industry, it confidently cites old models like GPT-4o or Sonnet 3.5 as current SOTA. These hiccups add up\n\nPerplexity Pro Search is still my daily deep search utility. I find myself needing it \\~12 times a day because I know Google or Gemini (or ChatGPT) will hallucinate the answer.\n\nCurious about your workflows. How many times a day do you feel forced to use Perplexity because you know the others (including ChatGPT) will fail? Do you feel Google is catching up fast enough to make Perplexity Search redundant?\n\nEDIT:\n\nWith a US VPN, I was able to try Deep Search in G AI Mode for the first time. It looks good. Not sure what the usage limits are when it rolls out globally but that is a real threat to Perplexity Search",

From a business perspective, I understand why they are doing this, but this is not sustainable for Perplexity - especially as they throttle pro (because it is watered down from free users) and the only solution for me is upgrading to much more expensive model. \n\nP has a great product. I use spaces for both personal and business.   \n  \nHowever, where G is killing them is in their token size of uploads. I use G GEM for one of my main business time suck tasks, and it now performs this task very well (as soon as I got the prompt right). Perplexity had me breaking these files down so much it became a cat and mouse game to figure out where to cut it up to get it to work and then the prompt became unwieldy to make sure it put together the whole picture of what I needed. I acknowledge my own lack of prompt knowledge, but I don't have time to become a prompt engineer, I have to run my business. \n\nThe reality for me as a non-coding businessman, I am not doing extensive lab research on ameba or dna, or coding some complex task, I just need a reliable result.   \n  \nYes, Ai can make mistakes, but the source thing is becoming less valuable to me over time as both models are getting better and hallucinating. We have a long way to go in this, and I can usually see something questionable, and when I do, I fact check it. For me, this will be the breaking point with P.\n\nIt is WHEN, not if, G will catch up and surpass P because they have the money to do so. Until then I will use both.",

Companies love doing silent A/B tests on random users, and honestly it wouldn’t surprise me if they’re experimenting with new limits before rolling them out more widely.\n\nIf this really is targeted testing and not an actual public change, that makes it even worse. Paying customers shouldn’t wake up one day and find themselves downgraded because of some backend experiment.\n\nIf this is how they handle things, then yeah, my subscription’s done.

From what I understand perplexity has its own model that searches the web based on your prompt and then whichever model you choose just reads that and decides what words to put on the screen. \n\nIt isn't a chatbot the way the underlying model is due to the way it handles context windows.The latest chatgpt has a context window of 400k tokens I believe. Which more or less means you can chat with it for 400k words (sort of) before it starts to forget things you spoke about earlier in your chat. \n\nI'm not sure what perplexities context window is or but I do believe it's very small and it also has to copy and paste your previous prompts into each new prompt. This basically means you won't be able to have a flowing conversation with it. Not in the same way as the other models on there own sites anyway.\n\nFor me, I mainly like to ask questions, get an answer, and move on. It's fun to cycle through all the models to see how they answer but in the end I always open the sources and look at the sites myself. If you just want to ask questions perplexity is awesome but if you want to have a long conservation then I recommend another model but perplexity is still great to fact check things it says.",

The 32k token limit per thread is really annoying for brainstorming but it's not the end of the world - when you get the \"long conversation\" notice you can just tell the AI to create its own prompt for your next thread and make sure you put long brainstorming into a Workspace (I'm not sure if that does anything other than organize honestly).\n\nTLDR; it's worth it if you need the research library AND you can get it cheap. If they jack my price at the end of my year, I'll probably go somewhere that doesn't have that 32k token limit. If that doesn't matter to you and you can get it cheap, I'd say it's worth it so far.",
