It used to be 600 a day and the limit would never change, which I did always think was really strange. But now mine changed to like 20 a month\n\nI honestly really think a real limit is necessary, but 20 a month is really, really low... could we at least get like 10 a day, or even 5 a day? I hope you will listen to users on this because I bet the research has gotten even better, but I want to be able to use it at an actually reasonable limit",

One request in Opus used up 50% of my five-hour limit, and the remaining 50% was enough for four more requests. Today, I returned to Codex High, worked intensively on my application all evening, and my limits were not exhausted, there were about 20 heavy requests. There is no point in using a Claude Code subscription for less than $100 per month, which is why there are such restrictions on Perplexity. But 20 requests is ridiculous in any case.",

Maybe they use research lite which uses Sonar by default and you get 20 normal research or maybe research advanced prompts per month also if they set a very strict limit on the number of searches a day, users will not be able to use, as their primary web browser anymore because normal web searches would be perplexity searches and quickly exhaust their quota.",

It technically counted toward my quota, but with 200 per day, the limit was high enough that I never had to think about it.. With only 20 Deep Research runs per month, I now feel significant rate-limit anxiety, similar to what I experienced with ChatGPT.\n\nIdeally, I’d love to see both options available: the new Opus 4.5-based Deep Research for high-stakes work, and the older version (I believe based on a custom DeepSeek R1) for everyday research, with a more generous daily cap, say **20-30 per day** instead of the former \\~200.",

Sure, ChatGPT might offer the same for their plus tier but they offer higher context window with GPT5.2 thinking and 3000 queries per week for that. They offer many more features that Perplexity tried to imitate and doesn’t do as well. \n\nRight now it seems like Gemini AI pro is the best option in the mid tier subscriptions due to the context window, usage limits, the 2TB of cloud storage, and giving you 25 deep research queries per day. Googles web indexing is unmatched and they have improved their deep research rapidly that it’s even better than Perplexity pro imo. \n\nPerplexity at its core is a search engine but with a chatbot and nice UI. Its search first and Chabot second. \n\nThis is so shady and manipulative from them. And they’re to blame for it all cuz they gave away free annual promotions and subscriptions left and right like it’s candy. And they did this just to increase their user base and market cap. \n\nThey won’t survive another 2 years if they continue like this. And they tried to imitate ChatGPT and Gemini with all the features they added in the past 6 months. But disregard and neglected wha made them different and better in the first pace: their web search and deep research. \n\nPro feels like the new free tier and Max is like what pro was exactly a year ago. \n\n$200USD/month just doesn’t justify the Max tier in any shape or form since again, the long memory sucks, context window is 32K and nothing changed but more usage limits. You really get nothing. \n\nAt this point having ChatGPT plus, Gemini AI Pro, and Claude Max (the $100 one) is a much better stack and deal.",

I split the test into two phases:\n\n * Phase 1 (Standard): I asked the question directly without any additional instructions.\n\n * Phase 2 (Prompt Engineering): I used specific instructions telling the AI to think much more deeply, utilize a significantly higher number of sources, and prioritize these new instructions over all else.\n\nThe Results\n\n| Feature | Standard Response | Engineered Prompt |\n|---|---|---|\n| Length | Normal (a few paragraphs) | Much longer (multiple sections) |\n| Source Count | 11 sources | 18 sources |\n| Quality | Good, standard output | Exhaustive and deep |\n\n\nMy Conclusion\n\nI’ve concluded that by spending a little more time on prompt design, I can develop a \"template\" to use as a prefix for any question requiring deep research.\nWhile it is certainly less convenient than a \"one-click\" deep search button, but it work.",

In order to update the text inside the app, they have to submit an app update to Apple and wait for it to be approved.\n\nThe new advanced deep research is powered by Opus 4.5, so it costs a considerable amount of more money to run than the previous Deep Research, which I believe was run via a Chinese OSS model.\n\nI believe that once you exhaust the advanced research quota it falls back to the previous version of Research.\n\nBut this is very confusing, Perplexity should have just waited for a chance to be able to push an app update before pushing the new Advanced research.",

Even something simple like “light council” vs “full council,” or a way to prioritize a preferred model when there is disagreement, would make it feel less like a black box and more like a tool I can tune for different tasks.",

      "text": "For starters, if you see me get banned or this post removed, you will understand the kind of damage control the employees and moderators of Perplexity have been doing all along. I have DMed and received DMs from multiple people who previously made posts criticizing a certain service and questioning why these issues were happening to them. Shortly after, their posts were removed and they were permanently banned from this sub.\n\nBefore coming to the issue of Deep Research being reduced, it is necessary to point out that the company’s scummy behavior began with the deliberate rerouting of models.\n\n1. Re-routing\n\nIn the past, the model was silently rerouted to inferior and cheaper alternatives. For those who do not understand the chart below, the network requests can be easily tracked using a variety of tools, as the model name is included in the request payload.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95aku8o6biig1.png?width=1655&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9ddaaf7d244c200faf267ef8467a692dc7732eb\n\nOne such example:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/266cgpurbiig1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=476d9a82c8f232b373991f7b4a38e05296f97973\n\n2. Thorttling Answers\n\nAfter this, the issue was supposedly fixed by showing a prompt at the end stating that the model had been rerouted due to unavailability. However, we then started seeing severely degraded answer quality, even for Pro users, who appeared to be throttled.\n\n3. Image Generation being Reduced.\n\nEven for Pro users, image generation, which was supposedly “unlimited,” was throttled. We began seeing monthly limitations, and image generation was eventually geo-blocked to specific locations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q2gdfheodiig1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e87f952c29b0b6bab57b82930bb8efdd5f9f4e4\n\n4. Deep-Research\n\nFor starters, Deep Research is listed as unlimited in the “Select your plan” section.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fevlkigxdiig1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=765ac33f5a438dbf9d5a3d5fda186b51be49700b\n\nHowever, the real scumminess of the company becomes apparent when you look deeper into the terms and conditions. For example, around August, Deep Research was supposed to be limited to 500 queries per day.\n\nPro queries were also supposed to be unlimited, as shown in the image below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lb7e62wveiig1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fe1df3acb6b25b138af5fc714b27332c6061fbd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7b84kza9eiig1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=738d9daac9fe42d48ce9f36c15ec0d554f729c53\n\nHowever, both have now been throttled and reduced, effectively scamming their customers, especially those who pay for Pro annually, by deliberately changing the terms of their contract midway, which is arguably illegal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cyk4amnteiig1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=78b51cc0c881ee4c8582047c168a3efd12bdb6c1\n\nThe webpages have been changed, but they previously stated that Deep Research was unlimited. For some reason, the Wayback Machine is unable to fetch the page at that URL.\n\nI hope Perplexity stops this scamming behavior for the better, or that someone buys the company and turns it around or there are better alternatives.",

Remarkably, that single prompt generated a single 13-page answer—just in normal mode, without any deep research. This reinforces my belief that how you craft and use prompts matters most.

      "text": "I have the $20 subscriptions to all of the above services (yes the pro sub, not the max/ultra tiers). Perplexity seems to be rolling this out to the pro users right now (it was indicated that it is a newer version of DR in the selection modal), the newer deep research powered by Sonnet 4.5. I decided to see how it performs against the above two. The prompt I gave it is in the links.\nBefore we proceed, here's some data about sources browsed/output length\n\nChatgpt Deep research - 18 sources, 89 searches, 11 minutes, roughly just over 1100 tokens\n\nGemini Deep research - roughly 3500 tokens, close to 100 ish sources\n\nPerplexity Deep research - 5555 tokens roughly, 98 sources browsed\n\nLinks to answers, incase you don't want to take my word and do you own evals\n\nChatgpt Deep research report - https://chatgpt.com/share/69878a57-e1cc-8012-80b1-5faf5a39d4b2\n\nGemini Deep research report - https://gemini.google.com/share/a6201a2acf9a\n\nPerplexity - https://www.perplexity.ai/search/deep-research-task-android-fla-sTIHXB.OTAaC4fvbYREINA?preview=1#0\n\nI will now rank the results I got on different axes\n\nFirst, based on accuracy/quality (most important)\n\nNow, I won't be too harsh on Antutu/Geekbench scores, since these benchmarks results might vary and some level of variance is expected. If they are in the ballpark of what multiple credible sources show, it is acceptable. Same goes for stuff like video game FPS benchmarks/Screen time numbers too. For not complicating this too much, let's consider sources like gsmarena/phonearena as highest quality sources with proper testing data.\n\nChatgpt -  Clearly making up stuff about blind camera tests conducted by MKBHD. The last camera test he did was in late 2023. Wrongly surfs those old sources, gets ELO scores for ancient models like pixel 7a and oneplus 11 (it's 2026 man) and shows it as results for latest models. Hallucinations of this level is not acceptable. Shows wrong PWM values for oneplus 13 (2160 Hz is correct, not 4160 hz). Wrong charging wattage shown for pixel 10 pro, 10 pro is capped at 30W. Not 37-40W. Quality of answer is definitely not the best, worked for 11 minutes and only compared 2 phones.\n\nGemini - Gemini failed big time at following instructions (which we will discuss below) - which in turn affected the answer too. A place where Gemini made a big blunder, same as chatgpt, wrongly shows that MKBHD conducted blind camera tests in 2025/2026? And is showing some ELO scores for camera performances which we can't even verify? If you people can verify it, please comment down below. But coming to the overall quality, Gemini is just all over the place. For Antutu benchmarks, it compared S26 ultra (which is not even released, I clearly mentioned phones released in the last few months) vs Pixel 10 pro Xl. Then, added two more phones with the above two to the mix while comparing brightness/PWM, and showed wrong PWM values for the Xiaomi 17 ultra. Gemini also shows that 10 pro XL holds industry record for usable brightness? I have seen multiple other phones with more nits at peak brightness. Doubt ( a search shows its currently motorola signature, 6200 nits peak). Next, for the camera comparison, it added iphone 17 pro to the mix when i specifically asked for androids only. It should just pick a set of phones and not keep changing it in between comparison.\n\nPerplexity - GPU stress test for Pixel 10 pro is wrongly shown. As per GSM, pixel 10 pro performs decent in this benchmark, scoring around 70%. Perplexity shows it as 40% for some reason. Perplexity also shows auto brightness and a separate peak brightness category, which are not the same, (heads up not to get confused). Debatable between brightness comparison of pixel 10 pro vs s25 ultra, some say its pixel and others say its s25 ultra, so won't be deducting points here. But the important thing to note here - atleast it doesn't make up fake ELO scores based on imaginary tests like the other two deep research. It clearly clarified that that MKBHD camera blind test was last made in 2023 and instead gave whatever truthful info it got from web. Point to perplexity here, I think it is definitely more accurate than the other two.\n\nGenshin/Antutu/Geekbench/SOTs tests are compiled from many different sources, I manually checked each and every number and for all three DR, they're more or less in the ballpark of legit values. Feel free to correct in comments\n\nNow let's compare the results based on following instructions/better UI-UX:\n\nI clearly mention in my prompt that inline images + sources ARE a must. And that the phone had to be released in the last 6 months (not any unreleased phones) + android only\n\nGemini - worst in following instructions. I have used this DR a bit before, but not that much. I'm not sure if they support inline images/inline citations (definitely poor UX, since the other two do it. Needing inline citations is a must for quick fact checks). But the most important part - it keeps throwing S26 ultra in the mix when I only asked for already released phones? S26 ultra is set to release this month, it SHOULD not be in this report. Yes, I know there's benchmark values reported for S26 ultra (like those spotted on geekbench) , but best if taken with a pinch of salt. Points deducted for not following, also taking into fact that it even compared iphones with android phones. Not good.\n\nChatgpt - Better than Gemini, inline images + citations shown for table values. Showed only android phones as per my filters.\n\nPerplexity - Followed instructions the best, showed phones as per my filters, inline images and citations (for easier number verifications). But have to give instruction following ranking #1 to Perplexity as well, since I specifically asked it to compare major brands, and it did show multiple phones. Chatgpt started out fine, researching multiple phones and switched up midway and just showed results for 2 phones. Not great instruction following, but definitely better than Gemini since it did not show rumoured S26 ultra data/iPhone comparisons, neither did Perplexity.\n\nOverall rankings\n\n#1 - Perplexity clearly has lesser factual inaccuracies (I'm not saying it is 100% error free, there are some places where the info is stale/incorrect, like showing stale info about oneplus still having alert sliders in latest models) - but it is atleast TRUTHFUL and does not make up imaginary ELO scores. Shows whatever it got from browsing. Follows my instructions much better than the other two. Showed much more interesting benchmark data too inside a visual and comprehensive report. Yes, I know we can't decide quality based on output length alone, but this was better factually too. Could have shown more RAM data though.\n\n#2 - Chatgpt. Even though it was very lazy in it's work, comparing only 2 phones, compared to Gemini, it did follow better instructions and showed inline images/citations. Both hallucinated a bit more, but giving this to chatgpt deep research.\n\n#3 - Gemini. Did not follow my instructions, shows much more hallucinated/wrong info. Maybe comparable to chatgpt in terms of wrong stuff shown, but this answer was not what I was looking for.\n\nFeel free to do your own research and comment down below. \n\nEdit 1 - A user was kind enough to [point](https://www.reddit.com/r/perplexity_ai/comments/1qyo0rf/comment/o4adrgr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) out to use thinking/pro on gemini DR to get better instruction following and lesser hallucinations. [Ran](https://gemini.google.com/share/a6f8d3deed78) the same prompt again.Maybe better at mentioning only phones released in the last 6 months, following instructions better, but got very low quality information, as usual, just like before when I ran DR with fast.

Also, you should always check the plan it generates to verify if understands what type of data you really need.\n\n\nYou said it kept mentioning Galaxy S26, but in the plan it specifically said it would. In the FIRST line actually. You should have edited the plan before proceeding, but you either didn't care to read it or you didn't care for accuracy.\n\nAlso, maybe I missed it, but I don't think you mentioned which model did you use. By default it uses Gemini Flash, which makes quicker Researches but way less accurately. If you choose Thinking or Pro you will usually get much better data.\n\n\nIf you use it the same way you're used to with Perplexity research it obviously will not work as it should. Each service offer a different system to deal with, and simply replicating the same prompt is not a good way to benchmark.\n\n\nIf you want a good benchmark for research, set an objective: what data you actually need? Then understand how each of these system work and try to make the best out of it. And THEN compare the results.\n\n\nAlso, asking it to format the output won't help the research process. You can ask for it format the data later, in a non-research environment.\n\n\nIt almost surprises me to see people here (if not bots) saying that it is good information. This benchmark is lazy to say the least, if it wasn't made misleading on purpose.",

You can ask it to limit sources to a period, if you want for example, to make sure it will only search up to date information. If you did one research that you didn't like the results because of the sources, you can ask it next time not to use these sources.\n\n\nAnd try to be more specific. Instead of doing one research for a lot of different data, specialize the prompt for one type of data, and make another plan for another type of data. It works much better when it can focus on something specific.\n\n\nAnd if you're a subscriber, always choose Thinking or Pro. Flash is good for quick researches, but if you want to make sure it gets accurate data for something important, Thinking/Pro works much better.",

Yeah that's their problem. If it is genuinely unsustainable to the point they need to bring it down by 98% in just ONE YEAR, maybe that's their fault.\n\nIf what they sold isn't possible... why am I in the wrong for using what was offered and getting upset when it's reduced by 98% without communication?",

I rarely rely on Perplexity because, unfortunately, the quality has declined a long time ago. For the price, they offer too many models, really, Claude, Gemini, GPT, even though they have a light version. \nIf you follow changes in AI models, it has long been clear that perplexity will get worse and worse until it simply collapses. The advantage of perplexity was searching for sources, and that's it. All these models are of little significance because they are more of an addition to searching. They used to be a great choice because no one else was delivering such results, but today many other models are very good at searching for sources on the internet. Perplexity offers absolutely nothing but searching, and it is impossible to improve that all the time.",

I remember checking the website, and it still claimed to offer \"unlimited\" Pro searches and Deep Research. Despite not using Perplexity at all this month, I currently only have 4 research queries and 9 labs available.\n\nI sent an email requesting a cancellation because Perplexity altered the service between my charge date and the end of their 72-hour refund period; all without notifying me. While a Terms of Service (TOS) might allow a company to modify its offerings, they are still obligated to notify the customer. This is why companies like Amazon or Netflix post notices when content is leaving or provide countdowns.\n\nChanging the entire value proposition overnight while the website still advertises the old terms is deceptive and fits the definition of a scam. While Perplexity can change their service as they see fit, they must provide notice and offer customers a prorated refund if they disagree with the new terms. You cannot claim to provide 1,000 movies a month and then only deliver 10; that is a classic bait-and-switch, which is illegal under FTC guidelines.\n\nTo make matters worse, when I told Perplexity Support (which is an AI) that the company was acting like a criminal enterprise, it claimed I was \"threatening\" it. The AI then informed me that my account would be suspended if I requested a chargeback through my credit card. I hope a class action lawsuit is in the works; I would join it in a heartbeat. Regardless, I am going to ensure no one else gets swindled by this company.",

                  "text": "The best alternative is Gemini. In Gemini, the value for money is just insane tbh. They have not slashed usage limits. In the Gemini Ai Pro Plan, you have 100 Gemini 3 Pro queries per day, and 300 queries per day with Gemini 3 Thinking. You get NotebookLM Pro, with the ability to create 500 notebooks, each with 300 sources, a 1-million-context-window, 20 deep research reports per day, and 2TB of Google Drive storage.\n\nPlus, Google's web indexing and access to sources are still unmatched. After all, they perfected web search and the Google search engine for 25 years and wrote the game on it.\n\nAnd yoiu get access to nano banana and anno banana pro...\n\nSure, call Google greedy as much as you want. Quite frankly, in terms of all the AI companies and all the chatbots that are out there, Gemini is giving you the best value right now. And btw, if you're a university student, you get 12 months free for Gemini AI Pro, which is just crazy.\n\nAll that for $25/month. Now compare that Perplexity Pro, which is the same price, and see how much you're getting now. Even back then, Perplexity gave you 600 Deep Research Queries per day; what people seem to forget is that Perplexity's Deep Research Reports are very concise due to its limited context window. So a Deep Research Report with Gemini is much more thorough, extensive, detailed, and uses visual images. You can export it to a Google Doc, and from there you can export it as a PDF, text file, docx file, or whatever format you want. Gemini is truly the best right now.\n\nChatGPT still has the best chatbot experience and the best long-term memory. It's still unmatched in doing those things. They have the most partnerships with other apps through their app connectors, like Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), Apple Music, Spotify, etc., but in terms of a mid-tier plan with generous usage limits and a powerful model, Gemini is still the best. Also, the fact that you can have it in Docs in Google Docs, Google Slides, Google Drive, virtually all the google workspace workspace apps and in youtube it's just wild i could literally paste a youtube video link and ask it to give me the full transcription or just have access to it on youtube itself to summarize a video or get the full transcription easily. That's great for large podcasts, lectures, documentaries, or videos you're watching.\n\nI still have ChatGPT Pro, but Gemini AI Pro truly feels like it's a high-end 200-300-dollar... dollar tier, which makes me think Google might raise prices and add a cheaper tier below Gemini AI Pro in the future, since they offer such generous limits. I hope they don't slash it. And I don't think they will because for Google, Gemini is a side project. They honestly don't care if they're losing money- they could invest dozens of billions of dollars a year just in Gemini alone, and they wouldn't care. They're just a much larger company with more investors, more funding, more resources, more engineers. For companies like Perplexity, OpenAI, and Anthropic, all they have is their chatbot. They don't make hardware, software or apps. So if they're not the best, they're losing, and they're dead, but Google can afford to give people generous usage limits and all these features while keeping prices competitive.\n\nIn fact, Gemini is taking so many ChatGPT users, and they increased their market share exponentially with the release of Gemini 3. \n\nChatGPT for daily redundant tasks and searches, and Gemini for larger tasks and work, cuz of the context window. That's my workflow right now.\n\nNow, Gemini Ultra is just over the top, to be honest. I mean, who truly needs 500 deep research queries per day (especially since Gemini deep research queries take 10-20 minutes to finish)? Still, the best stack right now, honestly, if you are willing to spend the money, is ChatGPT Pro because of access to GPT 5.2 Pro and the amount of deep research queries you get, 250 per day, and on ChatGPT, the deep research is still the most well-reasoned. It actually analyzes and synthesizes the information. It's still the best quality and the most accurate, but it's the slowest and has the fewest usage limits for the tier that it's in. By comparison, Gemini Ultra is $250/month, and it gives you 500 deep research queries per day. But ChatGPT Pro is $200/month, and it gives you 250 deep research queries per month, but only 125 of them are comprehensive deep research. The other 125 are limited to deep research. This means it searches fewer websites, and there are reasons for it.",

          "text": "I agree that this is a scam, and what they are doing is very misleading and shady. This is grounds for a lawsuit. Seriously. At the same time, I am not condoning what they did, but again I am going to explain why they slashed the limits, which is still Perplexity's fault and own idiotic mismanagement. \n\nIf you give away free subscriptions, free annual promotions, and plans left and right, this is what's going to happen. It costs them so much money, and they couldn't keep up, and people took advantage of it because it was so easy to get free annual pro subscriptions or just make a new PayPal account or this or that, you know, all these deals that they did in an attempt to garner more users. And increase their market cap to secure an exit. This is the disaster that happens after all of that. You can't just overnight cut deep research limits for more than 90% of users. No company does this. Perplexity will not survive another two years, mark my words. If they continue like this, they will not survive.\nAlso, for any real amount of demanding work, Perplexity is useless. It truly is. \n\nThey also mislead new customers when they say you have access to these models. You have access to these models, which are system-prompted by Perplexity and refined and optimized within its parameters. For web search and deep research, they're all limited to a 32k context window. Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini and Gemini 3 Pro and Perplexity are not the same. You can literally test this out by giving them both the same prompt - it's just night and day. Even this is the same across all models: GPT 5.2, thinking, and ChatGPT are much better than it is in Perplexity.\n\nPerplexity is only good right now for quick fact-checking, checking the weather, getting news updates, price-checking, and looking up the definition of a word. Something so simple. For any real amount of demanding work, it's useless to be honest. It used to be better, but since they introduced the Max tier, they've nerfed the Pro tier like crazy. I remember starting to use it in December 2024, and I subscribed right away in January 2025 because I saw value in it. Back then, a deep research query could take 15 to 20 to 25 minutes. It was reasonable for much longer, and it searched for much longer, and it also scoured more sources. Yeah, it wasn't as accurate, but at least the answers were more thorough. I mean, a Chad GPT or Gemini deep research report is just night and day compared to Perplexity. So much better. I would say a ChatGPT web search is on par with Perplexity's deep research. That's the difference, truly enough. And I am right now using the factors Perplexity Pro, Gemini Ultra ChatGPT Pro, and Super Grok. So I know what I'm talking about. I've been subscribed to all of these for more than a year and a half now. \n\nAnd they're so stupid that they give away free promotions and deals for annual pro subscriptions, thinking that people will turn those users into paid users. It won't. Anyone who is a heavy AI user, or even uses it casually but daily, would pay for it. I mean, even after the annual subscription, they would pay for it, but they gave away so many free promotions, and I don't know if there's any return on that. Essentially, they want the current Pro subscribers to become Max subscribers. And once that happens, then they're going to nerf the Max tier and include another tier. This is literally a house of cards, and it's a cycle of fraud. \n\nThe best chatbot right now, by far, with the best usage limits, is Gemini. ChatGPT still has the best long memory, the most app connectors, and the best chatbot. But Gemini has the best models. It gives you 2 terabytes of cloud storage, even with the mid-tier, and access to NotebookLM, the best image and video generation model.\n\nIf you're deeply into the Google Workspace, well, but there's no question you have to go with Gemini. You use it in Gmail, Chrome, YouTube, Slides, Docs, and everything. My advice is that every Perplexity customer who's not satisfied should just move to Gemini. Because Gemini's deep research is actually very visually appealing to users, it uses headings and subheadings, you can export it to Docs and maintain the same format, and it uses visuals. Google's indexing is also unmatched, and its deep research is very accurate, with access to many sources. And it gives you very generous limits, something like 25 deep research queries per day on Gemini Pro and something like 100 per day on the Ultra. Chad GPT still gives you 25 per month in Chad GPT Plus, but only 10 of those are deep research; the rest are limited to pre-search (or, as I like to call them, extended web search). \n\nBut I would much rather pay for Chad GPT Plus and Gemini Pro together and Supergrok than ever pay for Perplexity Max, because, as perplexing as Max is(pun intended), I don't see the value in it and the\n The price is abysmally high. \n\nIt doesn't make any difference; you just get more usage limits. But again, Perplexity is flawed at its core. They tried to imitate ChatGPT by introducing image and video generation, scheduled tasks, etc., but they neglected what made them special and what they were great at: web search and deep research. \n\nThey fell behind heavily, but Gemini and Chad GPT improved their web search and deep research so much over the past year that, in my opinion, they're better than Perplexity. I don't know, and they're great at multiple things. They're not just great at web search and deep research.",

A commercial decision, but this is not how it’s handled legally. Perplexity strikes me as one of those companies who don’t wanna pay for legal advice and then get in trouble and learn a lesson the hard way. \nA good commercial lawyer would have been able to advise them about what you said, notification obligation at the very least or simply offering pro rated refunds to avoid things escalating further.",

Did the same before in different spaces as an aid since I do study. However, I hit a limit last night for the first time ever and now seeing on Reddit all over that I’m not alone makes me wonder what’s going on. I also couldn’t get docx generated and delivered for some specific summaries from a pdf uploaded books like I did few weeks ago without any problems. It’s the last 2 or 3 weeks that weird stuff started happening and it’s escalating. \nI mean I tried ‘best’ but it’s a hit and miss for accuracy, ‘research’ is about 95% or has been for me after a ton of back and forth with it until I set it up right. Using actual one extensive prompt hasn’t worked well for me yet since my content is complex and requires tailored approach per course. I tried so many things and just wasted my time on it. Training it works wonderful but not I hit a limit in 10 days and I literally didn’t even use it past the setting up prompts that gave me results that were on point. So ya….i keep going on about it but I’m frustrated as they broke it while it actually worked quite well after training.\n\nPeople will say use Claude but each textbook is 900 pages plus additional materials. And no I don’t write papers with it but I do get one page generated  for keys to expand on academically myself since I’m making a point to limit use of references and citations and write from comprehension alone. I’m kinda challenging the system for demanding huge research based papers for MBA’s while comprehension and practical approach should be more valued from my exp and opinion hahaha…pain in the arzz \n\nGemini isn’t nearly as good to me even tho I have it. Works so so, accuracy is way on the 60s% no matter what I do to it. Even with ENI or custom prompts. Plus the nuance things is pretty sadly misunderstood.",

This aggressive limitation is a clear indication they are not able to keep up with the costs of AI, especially when they got so many users (including me) into the Pro plan with different free deals.

It was eventually going to explode. \n\nWith this said, I wonder what browser to move to now. I use Comet, but my subscription is ending in a few months and I will most likely not renew.

          "text": "Yes, Perplexity is getting worse and worse. I have a Pro subscription bundled with my Revolut plan, and I used to like using Perplexity, especially for deep research and Labs, because when used alongside other AIs they often complemented each other well, or I used it to cross-check them. There were also projects where Perplexity simply performed better than other AIs I use.\n\nAt the moment, I’m working as a favor for an acquaintance on a website. It’s a simple, static HTML page, and I thought I’d just do it in Perplexity Labs, but then suddenly a notification popped up saying that I’d run out of my quota — which until now had felt practically unlimited.\n\nFor me, Perplexity is dead. The only thing keeping me there is the Revolut plan.\nFrom the moment Revolut removes it from their offering, or I cancel my Revolut plan and no longer have a Pro subscription on Perplexity, that’s the end of the story for me.\n\nI can also imagine that Perplexity overcommitted itself. Basically, a lot of things run on Perplexity under the hood.\nFor example, in Hungary the “Telekom AI” also runs on Perplexity. I assume this also consumes resources. Just like the Revolut integration. That also eats up resources.\nAnd many other things.\n\nBut users shouldn’t be the ones punished for this. Instead, they should invest in new resources, or take on fewer commitments.",

          "text": "I think a lot of Perplexity’s current user base comes from those free one-year Pro plans they’ve been handing out. The real test will be retention once those subscriptions expire.\nThe challenge they’re facing is that users can now access the actual frontier models (Claude, GPT-5, etc.) directly from the developers themselves. And these direct integrations often come with better features - like Claude’s artifacts, advanced voice mode, or various IDE extensions for coding. When you can get the source models with superior tooling, it’s hard to justify staying with an intermediary.\nTheir in-house models also aren’t competitive with the leading options from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, or even some of the top Chinese labs. So they’re essentially a UI layer over other companies’ APIs rather than offering unique model capabilities.\nDon’t get me wrong - Perplexity has built a clean search-focused interface. But I’m curious whether that alone will be enough to retain paying customers long-term when the free trials end.",

Only after that I found out they had just “updated” Deep Research in early February and heavily cut the limits.\n\nI contacted support and explained that I subscribed when the limits were different, and now I’m stuck with a downgraded product in my very first month. The reply was basically:\n\n* “We have a 24‑hour refund window, no partial refunds ever, policy is final.”​\n* “We can’t change limits for individual users.”\n\nSo in practice: I paid, a few days later the main feature I signed up for became almost unusable, and I’m told to just live with it until the end of the month.\n\nI’ve already turned off auto‑renew and I’m not coming back to Pro in this state. Posting this as a heads‑up for anyone thinking about subscribing.",

There will be consequences for this decision—even if they're not legal ones, they may be reputational.\n\nI've already transitioned all of my workflows away from Perplexity to Google AI, and I recommend others do the same. You get 20 deep research reports per day instead of per month, plus you get a pro model (Gemini 3 Flash and Pro) instead of a very limited one. Gemini 3 Flash is way more powerful than Perplexity Sonar.",

You're not asking for special treatment. You're asking for the product you paid for, or a refund when that product was materially changed. Those are the only two reasonable options and they offered you neither.\n\nTwo practical paths forward:\n\n1. **Chargeback through your card issuer.** \"Services not as described\" is the reason code. You subscribed on Feb 4, the feature was downgraded within the same week, and the refund window expired before the downgrade occurred. This is clean.\n\n2. **If you're in the EU, UK, or Australia, you have statutory consumer rights that override any company's internal refund policy.** A material change to a digital service post-purchase triggers refund obligations regardless of what their terms say. Their support team either doesn't know this or is hoping you don't.\n\nEither way, don't just live with it. You have options beyond what their canned support response suggests.",

I don’t use Deep Research more than a few times a week, so if the main complaint is with that and that’s been limited, which I believe, I get that.\n\nBut to my understanding people are also running into limits with normal queries too, right?  I just did two queries as a test, one with Sonar and one with Gemini Pro Reasoning.  I looked at the limit page you posted (thank you for that!) and the limit listed at 600 did go down to 599 each time.  However, in 30 seconds it went back to 600.  Far as I can tell, none of the other numbers on the entire page decreased in any way (most are 5).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pf3r3j7braig1.jpeg?width=1206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c131643b7d528630aaabe6fece7a7d53951ee96f\n\nDo you know if there are some other limits being triggered not seen on this page?

Then I asked it to give me a detailed set of suggestions on how to do that, where to shop and get services instead, and make up a detailed timeline to do so. It gave me a beautiful, one detailed description of lots of alternatives, organized beautifully in a timeline, that made perfect sense for our family. I was very happy with that response, and could not imagine a better one using any different model.\n\nSo I am feeling that I am missing something in these discussions, where people are frustrated with the cutbacks. It appears that this is all related to “deep research“ and it may just be that for our family particular needs, we don’t need deep research.

Perpelxity has been scamming users for a while, and it has very recently crescendoed.\n\nLate 2025, they started auto-switching users back to \"Best\", or searching with a different model than the model you had selected:\n\nExample: You select Gemini Pro, but \"Best\" (aka Sonar, always) was used, or perhaps GPT 5.2, and a message would display \"Best was used because Gemini was unavailable.\n\nInfreqently this could be written off, but when it was consistent for weeks then of course it is clearly deliberate.\n\nIt appears they stopped this but now they just nerfed the ability to use anything to the extent you may have previously expected, except from their own cheap Sonar model.\n\nPro subscribers have experienced a DRAMATIC decrease in their allowances in the past week:\n\n* 600 Deep research daily (previously sold as unlimited with fair use) - Now 20 per week\n* Unlimited file uploads - Now 50 per week\n* Pro Searches? Apparently unlimited before (unsure of caps but I never hit them) - Now greatly capped.\n* Image generation appears to have been blocked altogether for many users but this too used to be \"unlimited\" for pro users.\n\nOnce you get hit with a restriction you invariably get asked to upgrade to Max, obviously.\n\nThis is Class Action worthy because users who paid annually have been hit with a plain-as-day Bait and Switch\n\nMany users are compiling evidence for a Class Action. The noise on Discord is even worse than Reddit.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/perplexity\\_ai/comments/1r0bpdy/perplexity\\_has\\_been\\_scamming\\_their\\_users/](https://www.reddit.com/r/perplexity_ai/comments/1r0bpdy/perplexity_has_been_scamming_their_users/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bhf5zo4r6jig1.png?width=1121&format=png&auto=webp&s=66a10939fe348d25765fba57caa448c3123e334c",

Here is how to report Perplexity.**\n\n\"Guys, there are millions of us in Europe—it’s time to make our voices heard and enforce our rights. I have personally filed a formal complaint with the Antitrust Authority and the European Consumer Centre (ECC). I urge every EU citizen to do the same!\n\nRemember: **Terms of Service (ToS) do not override European Law.** Furthermore, even if we signed up through a promotion, the service is **not** 'free'. Under EU law (Directive 2019/770), when you provide your personal data in exchange for a digital service, you are 'paying' with that data, and you are entitled to the same protections as a paying customer.\n\n**To my fellow Italians:** Contact the **AGCM (Antitrust)** via PEC here:[https://www.agcm.it/segnala-online/index](https://www.agcm.it/segnala-online/index)\n\n**To all EU citizens:** Write to the **European Consumer Centre**. You can find the contact details for your specific country here:[https://www.eccnet.eu/contact-your-local-ecc](https://www.eccnet.eu/contact-your-local-ecc)\n\nFor reference, here is the text I sent (translated into English for you to adapt):\n\n> I am reporting Perplexity INC. for unfair commercial practices regarding their 'Pro' subscription. This 12-month promotion (offered through partnerships with third parties like PayPal or mobile carriers) guaranteed access to specific features, such as dedicated image generation models and a set number of 'Deep Research' queries per day. ​Following the activation of the service, the company unilaterally and drastically reduced or removed these essential features. This has stripped the 'Pro' offer of its core value, making the service non-compliant with what was advertised at the time of signup. ​I believe this conduct constitutes a misleading commercial practice under the Consumer Code. Users were induced to sign up based on promises that were not kept, and the contract terms were worsened without any prior notice\n\n\nLet’s stand up for our rights. Don't let them get away with the 'bait-and-switch'! 🇪🇺",
