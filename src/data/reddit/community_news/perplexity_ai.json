Also, since you can have unlimited conversation, currently it is best. Also, there is no restriction on the size or length of the prompt, which is amazing. Too bad we cannot integrate it with Cursor.\n\n**Perplexity:** It is amazing at getting correct references and background checks for articles. Best for references.\n\n**Grok:** Amazing at problem-solving and making sure that the prompt is well understood from the user's perspective.\n\n**For coding purposes:** Claude >> Grok > [z.ai](http://z.ai/) \\> DeepSeek > ChatGPT\n\n**For cover letter, resume:** Claude > Grok > [z.ai](http://z.ai/) \\> ChatGPT\n\n**For reference:** Perplexity >>>>> Claude >>>>>>>> DeepSeek\n\nWhat do you think?

      "text": "Hi, I've had a Perplexity Pro subscription for almost a year now. Now I'm wondering why this service still exists (slightly overdramatized). First of all, Perplexity seems to scam users. If you have Pro, your requests don't always seem to be routed to the model you choose. This makes sense, since otherwise they couldn't offer \"Unlimited Pro Searches\" for $20 a month.\n\nBut the more important point, at least for me, is that it doesn't offer anything that other services don't have. Perplexity is a web search AI, and their concept, compared to their competitors, maybe made a difference a year ago. But not anymore, as basically all the AI chatbots have really good web search. Now, I feel it's more about the quality of the model, and because Perplexity (probably) not only routes your request to a cheaper model but also has the lowest cost API settings for the selected model, it's just horrible in this (important) category compared to its competitors.\n\nChatGPT with GPT-5.2 thinking + web search feels a million times better than GPT-5.2 thinking with all sources activated in Perplexity. More relevant sources, longer and more in-depth answers. And this is not just the case for ChatGPT, but basically any other big AI chatbot. What do you think about this, and what are your best \"replacements\" for Perplexity? (Has anyone any experience with Claude here? I think it's underrated when it comes to information gathering).",

A few things came to mind:\n\n>If you have Pro, your requests don't always seem to be routed to the model you choose. \n\nYeah that's true sometimes, though I just tend to use \"best\", but aside from their own models, perplexity doesn't control the availability of the other models, if it seems to be down, or high latency, it routes you to a model that is working the best it can. I think that's fair. Could they be doing it to save money? Maybe, but knowing the challenges all the models are having with capacity, I'll give them a break. Also, if a really preferred that model, I'll go to that provider for it.\n\nAt least you understand it's a search engine at it's heart.

The ability to start new conversation from existing conversation i.e branching\n\nNote: I think Perplexity had this and they removed it. Bummer. If I am not mistaken, Gemini have this feature. Usually SaaS compete for feature parity, I wonder why Perplexity remove this feature\n\n3. Gemini fixed it’s long context hallucination.\n\nNote: I switched to GPT 5.2 Thinking now, it’s better for researching papers and writing one.\n\nNote: I stayed with Perplexity because the main vendors have issues with their models and they tend to break from time to time (e.g the quality visibly drop). When they do, I simply switch model and continue with my research.\n\n4. Claude increased the quota.\n\nNote: I never use Claude because their quota is very small and their best model is not available in the Pro Plan.\n\nNote: This month I got Claude Pro for research given by my mentor to try Claude Code. Let’s see how it goes. Though I am pessimistic with the 10-40 messages quota for the Pro Plan (from the documentation). If the documentation is true, I have no idea whether all of this is just a marketing strategy by Anthropic telling everyone that they made Cowork using Claude Code when in reality average folks can’t do anything with Claude Code because the quota is very small",

Experimenting with system prompts (e.g. Introduce yourself globally or in instructions for a Space) is a big leverage point. \n\nAnother instance is model swapping when people are using the priciest models by default even when they’re not necessary. You don’t necessarily need Gemini 3 Pro High Thinking for threads about why your Arietta range hood is in cleaning model. Just rewrite with beefier models as needed and model swapping becomes much less common.",

      "text": "I mainly use Chatgpt to do my research, and then generate dashboards or simple webapps to visualise data through canvas. I recently got access to Perplexity pro, ( I use it daily as a general purpose search engine replacement for google) . I have still been using chatgpt for deeper research/visualising data, since everyone says it's the best deep research tool right now - So I put it to the test against Perplexity labs (which seems to combine deep research + building apps) , by running a few same prompts on each other- The results were quite surprising to me.\n\nSharing one such example here - \"Create a simple app of full fight analysis stats of the main/co-main events of the latest UFC event, use canvas tool\"\n\nRan the same above query in both the tools (modified the perplexity prompt a bit since the webapp color scheme was not my favourite)\n\nResults\n\nChatGPT's research capabilities seemed very subpar compared to Perplexity Labs' research capabilities (consistent with results for other queries too for me), if we're talking about retrieving fresh data consistently - we compare only the main/co-main events and the quality of the dashboard (since that's what I wanted, clearly specific in main prompt + follow up)\n\nChatgpt missed on so much of the important stats - Head strikes, Body strikes, Leg strikes. If we see the dashboard for the main event (the Gaethje fight), The round by round analysis is very bad with so many Null values in the UI. Perplexity's report is definitely cleaner, shows whatever chatgpt showed (significant strikes) + other stats properly (takedown attempts, control time)\n\nFor the co main event (O Malley fight) - Chatgpt failed terribly here, despite chatgpt's deep research running for much longer than Perplexity Labs, showed very less important data compared to Perplexity. No round by round breakdown present at all whereas Perplexity Labs showed all important stats like significant strikes, takedowns, control time - round by round (along with head/body/leg strikes , like it did for the main event)\n\nLabs does seem to be outperforming Chatgpt DR here (from running a few queries today), but can't decide with a small sample space, will continue testing it thoroughly and share more results here. What has your experience been with these features so far? Interested to hear them out\n\nLinks if anyone's interested\n\nChatGPT Deep research Links -\n\nhttps://chatgpt.com/canvas/shared/69763d1aeeec8191a808091339d0589e\n\nhttps://chatgpt.com/share/69763ae2-7afc-8012-a648-8522731bae29\n\nPerplexity labs Link -\n\nhttps://www.perplexity.ai/search/create-a-simple-app-of-full-fi-EDHnzY.UQ5iJT4J_gGSDDA#0",

I highly doubt that perplexity's own models train themselves or are trained by a scraping process you assumed. They are busy mimicing the other models quality while defending against current lawsuits. If you want to see a 'RAG'-quality at perplexity, just use a free account without login on any youtube-URL ;-)",

Meanwhile my account is suddenly capped at 10 per day. That’s a pretty big discrepancy.\n\nNow I’m wondering if my account got flagged into some kind of test group. Companies love doing silent A/B tests on random users, and honestly it wouldn’t surprise me if they’re experimenting with new limits before rolling them out more widely.\n\nIf this really is targeted testing and not an actual public change, that makes it even worse. Paying customers shouldn’t wake up one day and find themselves downgraded because of some backend experiment.\n\nIf this is how they handle things, then yeah, my subscription’s done.

Consequently, I received a refund for an order payment processed the day prior to this change, which was an automatic renewal. Subsequently, users confirmed that the limit had reverted to 600, its previous state. This led me to re-subscribe to the Pro membership, confirming the reinstatement of the 600 limit. However, within a day, the limit unexpectedly changed again, this time to 200. This lack of transparency regarding such alterations is profoundly frustrating, especially when no official announcements are made.",
