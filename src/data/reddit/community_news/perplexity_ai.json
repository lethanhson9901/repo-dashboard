I always find myself going to Perplexity for my go-to for a detailed research for normal \"day to day\" things - non-academic, non-finance, just normal things - like troubleshooting IT Issues, optimal picture profiles for TVs, best Spark Plugs for a specific car, etc etc.\n\nI'd say over the last 5 months or so, Research was \"good\" - would take 1-2 minutes to return a result that feels better than any of the other tools when doing a normal tool-calling web-search (Excluding social media targeted questions, like \"research the top 20 most recommended SSDs from Reddit Posts and X Posts - where Grok takes the crown), but for complex things, like, engineering a scope of work for a large IT project, I'd tend to rely more on running dual GPT5.2 Pro Heavy tool calling search on my Enterprise Account, and GPT5.2 Pro Deep Research on my Pro account synthesize the results.\n\nBUT - over the last week or so, Research is taking 3-15 minutes (Using research, not Labs) - and I'm HERE FOR IT. Output is much better, seems like it's pulling a ton more sources, and is handling multi-step instruction following much better.\n\nSo - first, is anyone else seeing this?

The new Research oddly at first doesn’t think the Switch 2 was released yet, stating it should be out by mid 2025, but then shortly after realizes it is out, and then found relevant sources for comparison.  It feels like the finished result shouldn’t have included this, but it did come up with a very long and detailed response in the end.\n\nAs for which is “Better”, in this one use case I’m not sure if having a longer slightly all over the place answer is better, but in fairness it did look through a lot of sources and other than the mixup at the beginning (which in later corrected), it was a very detailed answer.  I think the original old Research query could easily have been what Gemini Pro model in Search mode could have output.\n\nTLDR; they definitely changed it from last week and it covers a lot more sources and gives a much longer answer.  “Better”, hard to say, but definitely more information.",

I get an all around chat bot from a company that I know is here to stay.\n\nPerplexity is for agility. It kills FOMO as I’m not stuck with one AI model developer. I still believe ChatGPT is the single best chatbot if you can’t pair it with anything else, but you won’t have access to Anthropic there. I also prefer the Perplexity interaction for most prompts through the day, where I’m forced to ask a clear question rather than an open ended chat. \n\nPersonally, I’m a big fan of Perplexity Memory and Discover news feed (especially the read aloud audio). I don’t yet understand what Labs is for. Perplexity probably uses Whisper for dictation and ElevenLabs/another high end speech AI for speech. The other major AI apps don’t mix and match like that. \n\nUltimately, I get the flexibility with this stack. You get the stability of the Google ecosystem paired with Perplexity’s unique focus and model flexibility.",

      "text": "I’ve bounced between pretty much every major AI tool this year, but the two I keep coming back to are Gemini and Perplexity. Short version: I’ll keep a Gemini tab around in 2026 because I like to sanity-check things across models, but Perplexity is staying my main “workhorse” for anything that feels like actual research or day-to-day productivity. Especially with all the recent noise around Gemini, I felt like sharing my thoughts would be great and I would like to hear what others think as well. I'm sure this will get attraction of both sides, haters and lovers, as long as there's some good discussion. My problem with Gemini is simple: I don’t trust it with anything that matters. It’s flashy, sometimes clever, but it feels loose. It ignores instructions, drifts off into weird tangents, and hallucinates with way more confidence than I’m comfortable with. When I’m already tired, the last thing I want is to babysit an AI that keeps deciding it knows better than my prompt.\n\nPerplexity is not perfect, but it’s predictable enough that I can build real routines on top of it. Spaces are the second big thing for me. Being able to throw docs, PDFs, and links into one place and then treat that as a dedicated research pool changes how I prep for projects. I keep separate Spaces for work, side projects, and random rabbit holes. I don’t need to remember which chat had which link from three weeks ago. It’s all there, and I can keep querying it as the project evolves. Then there’s Comet. Having a browser that is built around this stuff instead of bolting AI on as an afterthought makes a difference. The built-in widgets, the way it handles search, the ability to keep research, browsing, and writing in the same environment without constant copy-paste gymnastics fits how I actually work. For long sessions, it feels like a proper “AI workstation” instead of just another tab. In 2026 I’ll keep checking Gemini whenever there’s a big update, because I like knowing what’s out there and sometimes it does give an angle I wouldn’t have considered. But I'll definitely keep PPLX in my rotation for next year",

It linked to too many sources that literally didn't have the info, so I quit very fast, not sure if they made progress since then. Now my okay-ish solution is HaloMate. It has hosted my entire workflow as I also got the trust issue with AI models. Now I got the habit to double check the output by regenerate answers using multiple models. My to-go trio right now is ClaudeOpus, GPT5T and GeminiPro. It's interesting to see how they \"think\" so differently sometimes, and also it's good to have them cross-check each other before I do the final check or merge while all context stays. The reason why I said ok-ish is because it does not offer image generation models that I sometimes need to use, but the good side is we still use Gemini at work so I can leverage the nano banana.",

          "text": "This is all very interesting to me to watch and engage in as it is happening and new developments drop almost weekly. \n\nI am a non-coder in the construction consulting business. I am finding there is a limit to Ai effectiveness from a time management perspective with reoccurring tasks. I started paying for Perplexity Pro a few months ago and looking into spaces. I now use a few spaces for work and a couple of health. \n\nSome of my files are pretty large and Gemini (also pay for pro) GEMS lets me upload the larger files and gives me very good responses. \n\nI have created my prompt for one major task and refined it by going back and forth between Gemini and Perplexity. It has gotten pretty good. It still needs a little tweaking but I am confident in the results I am getting so I am happy with that. \n\nOddly enough, I work in Microsoft and got into Ai through CoPilot. I quickly upgraded to Pro and was really excited to play with it and hopefully help me with my work, but have not found the pay off and may actually drop my subscription. It is not delivering - especially the ones embedded within Word, Excel, Outlook. \n\nI used Comet for a few weeks and really liked it and then I read some things about the security of it and got of out of it. I liked the functionality of it though. \n\nFor 2026 to me it is \"justify your existence\". I am going to do a time audit for a week on myself and act accordingly. I like my Ai toys for sure, but again, from a production standpoint, I am not sure. \n\nReading the tea leaves, and I fully acknowledge my statement may be completely unfounded or not realistic as I am not a IT or someone really knowledgeable in the Ai world.\n\nMoney is going to start winning out. I see the larger companies distancing themselves. The mad rush for energy is going to win and it is going to take big bucks to cover the gap until long term solutions are in place. I also think there will be consolidation and capacity purchasing. I also think the culture / energy impacts of all of this is going to get louder as we start to realize/accept the \"Cost\" of all of this mad rush in Ai Development. \n\nI think Gemini through it's google platform and CoPilot through it's Microsoft platform are going to be the most stable long term and they will start doing what they normally do and start restricting (if they have not already) how 3rd party platforms can interact with them, so they can protect their market share.  Again, my ignorance may be showing with this statement. \n\nI am thinking Perplexity has a place, but it seems to be losing it's way a little with value for Pro and not pushing everyone to their highest tier, and if they can get with Comet platform secure, this would be a huge win. \n\nI think Gemini will probably have some of the largest developments in 2026 but all of the shine in Ai is going to start wearing off except for the people in coding or specifically in the tech world. Schleps like me are only going to be able to use it so far. \n\nI think 2026 will also include more medical and mental/counseling type Ai platform development because the common joes are using it so much for this. \n\nI circle back around to my first statement. I don't remember an industry this dynamic with its development and it is a blast to live in it.",

It's sturdy, hard working, long detailed outputs (my analogy is falling apart now) and it can understand various documents and summarise them.\n\n\nIt can then also collate the various summaries of the dozens of files I uploaded, and keeps the context (non research seems to forget after 10 or 20 documents the first ones, without re prompting) \n\n\nI save my outputs into word or md file. Then once I have built my picture of understanding, I ask research mode to collate all in the thread / space (and upload or paste the outputs) - to create a master answer of sorts \n\n\nOnce I quickly verify everything I want is listed and understood correctly, then I can move on to reasoning models. As research is great but ott and not helpful for humans to read. \n\n\nUsually at this stage, I get gemini native app (outside of perplexity) on pro mode to assess this master output (usually accompanied by a prompt perplexity gives me, giving all the context required, as gemini has none of the abilities perplexity does for me, and forget always) - with some of the core documents uploaded too \n\n\nThen I revert back to perplexity, and use a reasoning model. Claude I find the best, gemini next. Chat gtp is better now, but habbit I just use it for the final layer, to make it more readable \n\n\nMy use case is complicated legal, medical, employment etc.. So text based. Analysing documents. Creating timeliness and understanding etc.. \n\n\nResearch mode gets all of this information there. But it's basically unusable, as no one reads 50 pages. But I find without research mode I am constantly manually inputting everything the search modes are missing \n\n\n- I am aware I'm likely misusing, as search is for online search, but honestly, the outputs are better than via gemini alone. Research mode is the basis of this imho. Takes a little longer, but is comprehensive\n\n\nSorry, to answer also. Web sources are helpful. But not so much my aim. Gemini app i find better for quoting law etc. But perplexity gives a good base layer for gemini to build on I find. The sources are helpful for checking, but tbh I tweak my prompt to be specific to my country, the laws etc.. This is where using my limited gemini prompts at key stages helps to guide perplexity - and vice versa, as the info research mode gives helps gemini produce much better answers than just the prompt alone\n\n\nI think I answered q 2 above kinda ha I should have asked perplexity to re word my neurondivergent stream of consciousness!! ",

              "text": "As one of the people who’s raised a lot of criticisms and concerns about Perplexity’s downgrading, it’s not that people like us “complain.”\n\nIf we’re in this subreddit taking the time to point out issues and give detailed criticism, it’s because we want Perplexity to do better. As paying customers, that’s literally our job. If something slips, we should say it clearly, because that’s how products improve.\n\nA lot of long-time subscribers, whether they’ve been around since 2024 or even early 2025, have watched the experience get worse in very noticeable ways. The best example is Deep Research. It’s not as thorough anymore, and it doesn’t reason for as long. Back in January 2025, Deep Research could take 10 minutes, sometimes 20, even 30, depending on the task. Now it’ll “finish” in under 8 minutes. Sometimes speed is nice, but in research mode, that time used to translate into depth.\n\nTo be clear, I’m not calling Perplexity garbage. It’s still a great tool and it offers a lot of useful features. The bigger concern is that it’s falling behind, and it hasn’t been innovative in the one area where it had a real niche.\n\nPerplexity’s edge was that it was basically the only AI subscription that consistently gave real-time, up-to-date sources and citations in a clean, research-first workflow. It was an AI search engine with chatbot capabilities, search first, chatbot second. But now it feels like they’re trying to transform into being “the next ChatGPT” or “the next Gemini,” stacking on features to compete with ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude, etc. \n\nThe problem is those apps already do the “general AI assistant” thing better, and they have bigger context windows and stronger reasoning workflows, great image and video generation models and actual LLMs. \n\nAt this point, other major chatbots have dramatically improved web search and deep research, and honestly they’re better than Perplexity at the thing Perplexity used to own. So Perplexity is slowly shifting from a tool built for researchers, professionals, students, academics, and business users into something closer to an entry-level AI chatbot for casual users. If you’re doing serious professional work, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and even Grok can be way more intuitive and power-user friendly.\n\nAnd again, I don’t hate Perplexity. I still think it has a ton of potential. That’s why it’s frustrating. Instead of doubling down on what made it special, being at the forefront of AI web search and deep research, it’s spending energy on features that other platforms already have (like image generation). \n\nIf you actually use Perplexity daily, most people would rather see them improve the search model, expand context limits, allow longer and more detailed responses, improve memory (real long-term memory, not “beta that barely exists”), and fix the issue where the model changes mid-thread without telling you. That last one is a massive flaw. You should not be guessing what model you’re talking to halfway through a workflow.\n\nAlso, a big part of what’s keeping Perplexity afloat right now feels like partnerships, bundles, and giving away 1-year Pro subscriptions through deals. That’s not a long-term strategy if the core experience keeps slipping.\n\nOne place where I’ll give them full credit is the Comet browser. Honestly it’s the best AI browser right now, and it’s not even close. It’s the only one that actually feels like it can do autonomous agentic tasks reliably, opening tabs, scrolling, navigating pages, filling out forms, adding things to cart. It’s miles ahead of the rest.\n\nWhat annoys me is when people say “Perplexity is the best tool for research” as if it’s still 2024 or early 2025. A lot of the time, that take comes from people who don’t really know how to use ChatGPT or Gemini for research. If you actually have Gemini Pro/Ultra or ChatGPT Plus/Pro and you know how to prompt properly, the deep research output is often more thorough, more logically structured, and more useful. You can get extensive, credible sources with clickable links, and the reasoning is usually stronger and more consistent.\n\nWhere Perplexity is still great: definitions, everyday quick searches, updates, launches, and news. Basically the kinds of things you’d normally do on Google with Chrome or Safari, but you want a cleaner answer with sources fast. Perplexity is excellent for that. But beyond that, I’m struggling to see it as a primary research tool anymore, because ChatGPT and Gemini have caught up and surpassed it in deep research and web search quality.\n\nSo for me, Perplexity is a second or third subscription, not the main one. If you’re a casual user who wants an AI app for quick learning, light studying, and everyday searches, it’s great. But if your workload ramps up and you’re doing real academic or business research, it’s just not the best tool anymore. Compare it directly to ChatGPT’s reasoning, long memory, and context window. Same for Gemini, especially with Google’s indexing and sourcing. It’s a different level.\n\nHere’s what would actually help Perplexity get back on track:\n\t1.\tIncrease the context window for outputs and responses. Right now it’s about 32K across the models they offer. They should at least double that. In 2026, 32K isn’t impressive. It’s starting to feel like 8K did back in 2023 with GPT 3. \n\t2.\tFix and properly build long-term memory. It’s still in beta and feels close to non-existent. Meanwhile, ChatGPT and Gemini actually remember preferences and constraints. If I tell them I want metric units, prices in CAD, or I don’t want certain wording, they keep that consistent. That kind of reliability matters a lot when you’re using these tools daily.\n\t3.\tFix the mid-thread model switching issue. If the model changes inside a single thread after a few searches, users should be told clearly. Silent switching ruins trust and makes results inconsistent, especially for research workflows.\n\nAnd expanding the context window should not only mean longer answers. It should also mean better handling of inputs, especially uploaded files. I don’t really trust Perplexity’s analysis when I upload a 10-page or 20-page PDF. It often feels like it’s not fully reading it. I trust ChatGPT and Gemini a lot more there, partly because their OCR and document handling are stronger, and partly because the context window actually lets them process the full text more reliably.\n\nThat’s the whole point. Perplexity is still good, but it could be much better. People raising concerns aren’t “complaining.” They’re signalling that the product is slipping and that Perplexity still has the opportunity to lead again if it focuses on the right priorities.",

That’s not a long-term strategy if the core experience keeps slipping.\n\nHard to say if the free Pro accounts and aggressive incentive/referral program have helped or hurt them. From reading this sub, it seems that every tech bro in a certain large South Asian nation was signing up huge numbers of users that may or may not be real, and may or may not ever turn into actual revenue for the company. \n\nPro became the new Free, as no company can actually offer a premium service for literally nothing. I guess the hope is that some of the 0/year folks will turn into paying customers after the year, but it's hard to expect someone to pay for a wide that's now performing like a freemium model. ",

Outputs are nowhere near the quality and depth when compared to before. I have comprehensive notebooks setup for my work with multiple artifacts uploaded, with custom conversational styles and max output length in settings - and everything is just straight up ignored. This happens with Gemini 3.0 on the Gemini platform too. For my use case, I want responses to use both my uploaded context and the web. \n\nI'm currently looking into other alternatives to move to, mainly - Chatgpt projects, Perplexity spaces and Claude projects. I had previously used Perplexity spaces before (I got access to the free pro subscription and moved completely to notebooklm when it expired). My perplexity spaces used Gemini 2.5 pro combined with web search and the response qualities were really good, but with significant model rate limits. \n\nI had not previously used Chatgpt projects and Claude projects. Is there anyone here who has used all three of these products? Which is currently the best? (currently leaning towards spaces but ready to hear other opinions)",

Well, because it shows they are ignoring my instruction to use reasoning.\n\nPreviously, it carefully took it's time to answer but now it is an instant answer no matter what. The issue is that it's a worse answer every time. Reasoning reduces hallucination and increasing the model's ability to carefully consider all sources. But today the answers have just been plain wrong 60% of the time.\n\nI literally just asked it a question about the RTX 5070 just now and it replied with \"this is a hypothetical GPU but ...\"\n\nIf it was Gemini 3 Pro or GPT 5.2 Thinking it would have never replied arguing that the RTX 5070 is a hypothetical GPU. But even though I selected GPT 5.2 Thinking (also tried with Gemini 3 Pro), they both replied with the same answer. They are very shadily  ignoring the model selector.\n\nThese types of silly stumbles only happen when you don't use reasoning models. This is not my only issue today but it is the most recent one.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, the number of sources searched keeps reducing. Previously, it searched like 100 sources. Then it got reduced to 20; and today it's 15.",

Like the actual ratings 8.2 and Gemini decided it was 6.7, a rating that movie never had at any point in time. Interestingly Google Search shows all of this accurately in their summary but of course that’s not LLM. \n\nIt also had trouble with movie names like “Predator Badlands (previously known as Predator Killer of Killers)”. When I asked why it conflated two separate movies it said because they were two movies of the same franchise in the same year, it thought they were the same and then hallucinated a name change.\n\nWhen I used ChatGPT for stock research, it kept hallucinating businesses, deals and entire companies that just did not exist. \n\nThis is inherent to nature of how LLMs work and is unlikely to go away completely ever.",

People will use a trial for 30 days, but it won't break their habit.  How do I know?  I'll give you a guess, i did some research with a good AI and it gave me the references to back it up.  Goes like this.\n\n1 get users on board at all costs. Burn VC$.  Get them using the product to the point they don't want to use Google Search any more.  (I got there  in about a week)  \n2 work out how to introduce ads that don't piss people off.     \n3. Shed the freeloaders.\n\nThey have some unique challenges.  Their target market is not \"what' the capital of France\", it's in-depth, complex queries.  Their user base tends to be more tech savvy, and with a higher disposable income.  The demographic has a *five times higher* online spend than the average.  So Perplexity users should be a highly sought after target.\n\nthere's two issues with that.  Firstly, on average, 1 in 3 people block ads.  In the high spend demographic it's 1 in 2 - we are much harder to target with advertising.  We don't like cheap collab deals (15% off Uber Eats for example) that are transparently costing the company nothing and are just another form of advertising.  The percentage of Linux, and Firefox users, is higher too, users who can completely block whatever they want unlike Chrome / Edge.  Our more complex queries carry a higher cost per user on average too.\n\nSo here you have a service specifically servicing a high spending demographic, that hates being marketed to, and costs more per user.\n\nHope that sheds some light on what's going on.  If in doubt, ask Perplexity the right questions, think critically, challenge all its assumptions and assertions and check the references.  If you can't, you're probably in the wrong r/.",

Spreadsheets, data extraction, reports, anything structured.\n* **Deep research** goes back to Perplexity, with Gemini as a backup. Gemini sounds smart but half the time it's just word vomit. Sophisticated language, zero actionable takeaway. I've tested this across hundreds of complex prompts (USPAP, asset management, market analysis) and it's consistent.\n* **GPT**? Can't even use it anymore. I used to love it. Now that I know what each tool is actually good at, there's just no reason to open it.\n\nI've tried simplifying the stack, dropping Perplexity, consolidating. Doesn't work. Once you stop fighting these tools and just lean into what each one does best, everything clicks. They start working for you instead of against you.\n\nOn the API side, we've gone deep: Claude handles our codebase, Perplexity powers research, GPT fills in the gaps. For structured responses, Perplexity wins hands down. From a valuation standpoint, it's been a game changer.\n\nI know Perplexity catches heat for certain things. But man, they've gotten a lot right. My two cents guys! Hopefully someone else can agree, they may not be perfect, but dang they've done some good stuff!",

          "text": "I’m sorry but if you have the highest tier for Gemini, Claud and ChatGPT then perplexity Max is not necessary. \n\nFor starters, you mentioned that for research, Perplexity works, but what type of research are you talking about? I agree that Perplexity is great for quick Google searches, definitions, quick fact-checking, and stuff like that or quick answers. But anything else, it's not as thorough, and its source selection is not as accurate and credible as Gemini and ChatGPT.\n\nAnd saying \"can't even use\" ChatGPT anymore because there's just no reason to \"open\" it. It just means you have not used ChatGPT to its fullest potential. Especially on the Pro plan. Try doing deep research with GPT 5.2 Pro model or GPT 5.2 Heavy Thinking. It's so much of a difference than regular deep research even in Gemini and especially in Perplexity. It's much better than those.\n\nNow Gemini Ultra is great for deep research because it shows nice infographics and organizes it nicely, and it has a nice layout to it. Gemini Ultra gives you the most features and quite frankly, use cases and usage limits out of all the high-end subscription tiers. But I have not heard anyone using Perplexity for deep research or research over Gemini or ChatGPT. Again, Perplexity is a great tool, but not for deep research or research. It's great for quick fact-checking, Google searches, small searches, stuff like that. So if they will use Google for everyday searches, Perplexity can be a replacement for that.\n\nAnd again, I've said this probably 30 times by now in this thread and this subreddit that you do not have access to all the models and Perplexity. You have access to a limited weekend version of those models with a limited content with a very small context window that a system prompted by Perplexity within the confines of Perplexity search deep research, and it's not that model itself at its fullest capacity and capability. So getting Gemini 3 Pro in Perplexity or GPT 5.2 thinking in Perplexity is not the same as getting them on their own respective chatbots. \n\nI would understand if getting the max here in Perplexity would help with Comet because of its usage limits. That would make sense, but Claude max is also a waste of money as well because it runs out because his usage limits are far inferior to ChatGPT Pro and Gemini ultra.\n\nNow you said you code, for coding it makes sense. \nBut I'm just talking generally, besides Gemini Ultra and ChatGPT Pro. If you have those two, you don't need anything else. Honestly, now, if you don't want to pay that much for subscriptions, then I will still get Gemini Pro Chat and ChatGPT Pro, and then throw in Perplexity Pro. But ChatGPT Pro, I think it's an essential in the high-end subscription tiers simply because of the usage limits, access to the pro model, and the fact that it would essentially help you make ChatGPT others yours. Your go-to for work as well. \n\nBecause think about it, if you're going to have 400 Agentic tasks and 250 deep research queries per month, then why not use ChatGPT Atlas? I've tried this, having ChatGPT Pro with, and then using ChatGPT Atlas is just crazy, and it makes the experience so much better. \n\nMy advice for anyone that wants to get the highest subscription tier for AI and any of these chatbots (besides Gemini ultra and ChatGPT pro), the rest are not worth it now. Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro would get the job done. If you want to have Claude and Perplexity, you don't need their max tiers.",

Google's indexing is the best, and it has access to the best sources and websites. It gives you much longer research reports, better access to sources. It's much more accurate. For instance, asking you to find 20 scholarly articles on your sub-argument for your thesis or on this topic or that topic, it finds you 20. This is very accurate sources, academic sources with the URL link, the full DOI, the full information. But Perplexity can't really do that because of its context window. It's very limited. I guess Perplexity is a good app, but for the preliminary stages of research. I guess brainstorming, and it's great for quick fact-checking definitions.

                  "text": "\nApologies for the long repeonse in advance.\n\nYes, I have done that experiment, and it's night and day. Truly, the difference is night and day. Again, Perplexity does use those models, but there are a couple of clarifications that are very important: it uses a limited version of that model with a much smaller context window.\n\nPerplexity itself acts in a certain way, so within the confines of Perplexity, let's say with the exact same prompt, if you do a search with Gemini 3 Pro and Perplexity, and use the exact same prompt in Gemini, I use Gemini 3 Pro, you would get different responses, and the one in Gemini itself would be much more thorough, logical, with better reasoning, and more extensive and accurate.\n\nNow, Perplexity is still quite accurate; it's still a great app, but if you're someone who uses AI heavily, I wouldn't rely on Perplexity as your only AI tool, and I would not pay for Perplexity Max because it just doesn't offer anything else. To be honest, already on Perplexity Pro, you get near unlimited pro searches and deep research queries per day (I think it's around 300-600, which is almost unlimited because no one would meet that limit). For Labs, sure, you get much more queries in Perplexity Max, but would you really only pay 10x in price just for more Labs queries alone? Doesn't make sense, does it?\n\nNow, if the perfect city max offered much more, such as double the context window, or improved memory features, or gave you access to features that are special to Perplexity Max alone, then it would make sense.\n\nThe third reason why it's different when you use that specific model in Perplexity and use it in its own native app or interface or chatbot is that going back to the context window is precisely that context matters a lot. The context window matters a lot, and I think of it like the horsepower of AI. There are two exact same cars with the same transmission, same exterior and interior, but one has a horsepower of 1 million tokens, the other has a horsepower of 32,000 tokens. Now you see the difference, don't you? \n\nNow, if you like, I said, if you're looking at Perplexity to be your only AI app and you use AI extensively for your work, for studies, for research, for your business, then I would advise against that. Perplexity would be good as your second, third, or fourth AI tool. It shouldn't be your main. It can be a main tool for the average Joe, for the mom or dad that just wants an AI app for someone that is not tech-savvy. They just want a nice AI app to get answers quickly and information. Yeah, that's good. But ChatGPT is a much better subscription to do plus is a much better subscription than Perplexity Pro. Quite frankly. ChatGPT has improved their web indexing and the accuracy of their sources and just the accuracy of the information gives you and the selection of the sources quite dramatically. For instance, I was writing a research paper and I wanted to quickly fact-check my references. I would never trust ChatGPT, but I did a web search; I just asked a simple question and it uses the Chicago Manual of Styles actual website. Perplexity ChatGPT wouldn't do this a year ago, but now it uses the most accurate website for the information that I needed. That's just one small example. And if you don't want to support OpenAI and you don't like ChatGPT at all, that's fine. \n\nThen the best alternative is Gemini, and quite frankly Gemini Pro, being the same price as ChatGPT plus and Perplexity Pro, is the best subscription to have since it gives you so much. It's deeply integrated into Google Workspace, so you can seamlessly export stuff to Google Slides, Google Docs, you can use it in Gmail, you can use it in YouTube, and it gives you access to NotebookLM Pro, which is the best tool for organizing your notes, research, and building a digital notebook. And in terms of the limits, I believe it's something like 25 deep research queries per day, whereas ChatGPT plus is 25 per month, and 15 of those are limited. Deep research which is like an extended web search. \n\nAnd Google's indexing is the best in the world. They basically wrote the game on the search engine; they've perfected it, and they have access to the best websites and sources. So when you do a web search in Gemini or a deep research, you get access to the best sources and websites and the most accurate information. For instance, the URL links that it gets are real, and they open up to real websites. But on ChatGPT, sometimes that's not the case, even on Perplexity, sometimes that is not the case, and the information could be outdated. \n\nSo, I guess if you really love Perplexity but you're going to use AI for work much more and you want more thorough answers, you want more capability, you want a powerful model, then I would advise you to get Gemini AI Pro and Perplexity Pro. Think of it like an investment. You're going to be spending $50/month, but it's super worth it. You're getting the best of both worlds. You're getting Perplexity with its quick answers, quick web searches, fact-checking, and all those different features and limited access to the different models it offers. And then you're getting Gemini AI where you're getting full access to Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini 3 Thinking, and you get much more thorough reports. It's better for writing. Basically, you get Gemini AI at 100% capacity.",

OpenAI (was a research org) is becoming a massive consumer tech company, betting on ChatGPT's commercial success.\n\nMy Tier 1 AI chat apps: ChatGPT, Perplexity, TypingMind.  \nThese are actual products with clear UX and intentional workflows.\n\nCopilot is a decent app, but the AI experience is surprisingly weaker than ChatGPT. Gemini has excellent models (esp Nano Banana) but the app itself has baffling UX flaws and unclear product direction. (I say this even if Gemini is my daily workhorse)\n\nPerplexity is arguably the best \"wrapper\" on the market.  \nApple, for comparison, is also a ChatGPT wrapper and will effectively be a Gemini wrapper in a couple of months.\n\nPerplexity is beating Google at Google’s own game: search, news, live finance, patents, and academic papers.\n\nUnlike ChatGPT or Gemini, you get Claude on Perplexity. Plus ElevenLabs, Kimi, DeepSeek, and whatever else matters next. It does not need to spend billions chasing SOTA models, so it pours its resources into the product surface. Retrieval, citations, ranking, UX.\n\nThe long term business model is risky. Your Perplexity answer is more expensive than a ChatGPT / Gemini response due to search, retrieval, and citation overhead. But also the AI chat app industry is getting too big to fail.\n\nIf OpenAI, which depends on ChatGPT (or the broader AI industry) crashes, the economy is in trouble. Perplexity is riding that same wave, with a differentiated focus.",

But over the last two weeks, the quality has been terrible. I went through all the effort of creating new Gems from scratch for my work only to face an extreme drop in quality. Chats which worked fine with 2.5 pro now fail all the time with 3.0 models. Refuses to follow my instructions, keeps lying about using context from previous chats (double checked to see if I had that setting on), ignores uploaded files, and also lies about browsing the web (for which I'm supposed to use AI mode and AI studio? Very poor UX) Surprisingly, I'm getting better performance for gemini models on 3rd party providers like Perplexity than from the provider itself (it is better at recalling info properly in long chats from my experience in the past two weeks). \n\nLuckily, I had set up spaces/projects on Perplexity and claude earlier, so I'm able to continue my work. Cancelling my Gemini sub until they fix this mess, will be using other services till then. Relieved to see that other users are facing this same issue as well. ",

At this point in time, I think the decision should be between Gemini and Perplexity as currently imo Gemini 3 is superior to ChatGPT in just about every way.  Maybe whatever comes after 5.2 for ChatGPT will be worth it.\n\nBetween Perplexity and Gemini, I use them for two different things.  If I’m looking for fast information to questions or want to learn things, I use Perplexity with Sonar or Gemini Flash 3.  I use Gemini for image generation or if I want summaries of plots of shows or series.  While perplexity can of course do this too, I think Gemini is better through Gemini platform directly.\n\nIf I had to keep only one though, Perplexity is my current favorite.",

Just look at how bad Manus has gotten, or how often ChatGPT and Gemini users ask if the models got worse. It's not unique to Perplexity - it just gets discussed more loudly here.\n\nThere are things I don't love, like some features being Max-only (the email assistant especially, because it's actually really good).

Maybe if you frequently use the Thinking models is what triggers it?  I don’t think Sonar or Gemini 3 Flash models do though.  I’m also not convinced it’s just not a bug.\n\nThere have been some issues on occasion with model rerouting happening if a model isn’t available for whatever reason, but the model it chooses seems to be fine when that happens. Can always rewrite it in another one.\n\nIf you’re looking to use Perplexity as a chatbot, which isn’t its intended usage, you might run into some issues.  The context window is pretty small and responses are optimized for data retrieval and most of the time limited (but reasonable) output tokens.\n\nFor $20 it’s incredibly worth it.  I’ve considered trying Max but $200 a month is too much.\n\nAs you’ve used perplexity before you would know if it’s the kind of thing you’re looking for.  If it’s not working out for you, try Gemini.  That’s the nice thing about the publicly available AI platforms at the moment, they’re all inexpensive and pretty noncommittal so if something isn’t what you’re after, give something else a try.  I personally wouldn’t consider dropping Perplexity atm, but in fairness also has no intention of dropping Gemini either.  Gemini does have a $10/mo off perk if you’re a Verizon wireless customer, but I’d still get it at full price.  I’d consider dropping ChatGPT but see no real reason to as it’s the first one I ever played around with and was impressed by, and Sora is fun to play around with (even if it’s not all that good compared to some of the things out there).",

If you're throwing massive PDFs (like 200+ pages) at it, Gemini is more reliable from my experience. Perplexity handles CSVs and structured data really well for me, but PDFs that big can be hit or miss.\n\nI don't think Perplexity lacks intelligence - it's more that Gemini is optimized for giant docs and long context, while Perplexity is optimized for thinking + search + comparisons.

Just higher rate limits but the models outputs are worse than my paid plus subscription. The response qualities are very subpar. To test it, I made the exact same queries on both the free go and paid plus plans. Created the exact same projects in both of these plans. I consistently faced issues in getting hallucinated responses, models not reading my uploaded files properly. \n\nOn the other hand, I get much much better models on the free Gemini plan  (3.0 and nano banana), don't really see any differences in output responses compared to the paid plan (except for a degradation in the deep research quality). I mainly use Gemini 3.0 for coding and generating media. \n\nLikewise for Perplexity pro through Airtel, even though I do have reduced rate limits (which I have seen in multiple subreddits), the quality seems easily better than Chatgpt go's responses for me. But the fact that I get a wide range of models (sonnet, even opus 4.5 for a while) is really worth it. For all web research related purposes, it is my go to now. Their research mode consistently outperforms Gemini's deep research for me (as stated above, this started happening in the last few days only, looks like Gemini is throttling their Deep research, it used to be better before)\n\n",

I don't write thesis anymore but I still do lots of long form writings and I need the context to persist across weeks. I also developed a habit of getting a second opinion from different models when I'm connecting arguments. They all think differently. Now my to-go set is I use Claude (usually start with Claude since it's faster and better at nuance) or GPT5T for the initial web research and I compare the results/do the verification work myself, and when I go deeper with the topics, I regenerate with 2-3 different models to compare the results, and I will do the merge/final check myself. Being able to switch models without losing the thread of my research is important to my workflow now.",

      "text": "Basically, the title\n\nOver the last few days most of my requests seem to be \"downgraded\" to some quick Perplexity model instead of what I normally ask (usually I try either Gemini 3 Pro with reasoning or GPT5.2).\n\nIt happens almost every other query, and the initial results are usually *terrible*. It gives the following message as the explainer: \"*Model: Used Best because Gemini 3 Pro was inapplicable or unavailable*.\"\n\nI don't get what \"*inapplicable*\" means in this context - the last time it was just a two-liner question asking what platforms exist in the US to order direct-to-consumer imaging like MRI, CT etc.. The initial response from the \"best\" model was almost immediate, but complete junk, some watered-down thoughts, almost a page long. When I asked to \"rewrite\" it using GPT5.2, I finally got some good response with specific links, descriptions, caveats etc. - basically, everything I'm coming to Perplexity AI for...\n\nThat said - **is this just a new way for P_AI to reroute more requests to their internal model**? Any way to disable this behavior? I'd rather prefer it to just error out if the underlying requested model is genuinely unavailable (or if I somehow exceeded my usage quota), not spit out some bs...\n\n**Edit later**: It [seems to be happening again](https://postimg.cc/HjyXs832), now with Sonnet 4.5. It feels like it randomly, yet deliberately ignores requested models and re-routes the request through its own \"Best\" model, probably in hopes that the user gets happy with the response. When you request to \"re-write\" the response with the model of your choice, it does so without further hesitation. Weird...\n\nP.S. I have Perplexity AI Pro subscription that I got for free using Paypal offer.\n\n**Edit 2**: It seems to be affecting any request with \"reasoning\". I.e. if you choose \"Claude Sonnet 4.5\", it will likely go through as requested. However, if you toggle \"with reasoning\" it will default to \"Best\". Also, as far as I see, you cannot really request \"reasoning\" through the \"rewrite\", so it looks like **Perplexity effectively disabled \"reasoning\"** on third-party mainstream models, if I understand it correctly?",

So if your process relies on iterative prompts, you'll find it'll start to adopt recency bias and rigid and repetitive thinking after 10-20 prompts in a thread. Perhaps this is what you see as skipping thinking?\n\nFor new threads, head to head, I find Perplexity better than native models. I can't explain why, but that's what I've noticed across completely different prompts over many months. YMMV.",

I have been a power user since gpt 3 times(not even 3.5 turbo) and the tasks I give to the LLM's span from every type of chat length and prompt complexity so I tried every possible combination and this was my verdict. I can confidently say that the amount of reasoning Perplexity models do are much shorter than their respecrive Pro plans of other LLMs.\n\nAs for skipping thinking, yes the models completely skip thinking even though it shows \"Reasoning\" on the message info. I have been experiencing this degradation for the last 1-2 weeks.\n\nI believe that your head to head testing experience is based merely on luck since these models ara nondeterministic and you can like one over the other sometimes.",
