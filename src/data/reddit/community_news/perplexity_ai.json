      "text": "Dear Perplexity team,\n\nI cancelled my subscription today. Lucky for me, it expires in April, but honestly, I was ready to renew without a second thought until recently. The way I see it, you have six weeks to show me you actually care about paying customers. The clock is ticking.\n\nFor the past ten months, I've been one of your biggest advocates. I recommended Perplexity to colleagues, friends, and anyone who'd listen. At $210/year it was worth every penny to me—a tool that genuinely improved my productivity and fit perfectly into my workflow.\n\nI haven't mentioned it once since the limits started dropping.\n\nAt first, I wasn't too worried about the changes. Then they kept piling on—until the limits dropped faster than Donnie's tariff threats on a Tuesday. When I learned about all the free subscriptions you handed out like candy, it suddenly made sense why you needed to reign in costs. But understanding *why* doesn't make it suck any less for those of us who actually paid real money.\n\nThis week I finally hit the wall where your new limits are actively hurting my productivity. I'm not just disappointed—I'm pissed. I'm pissed because paying customers like me are absorbing the consequences of decisions we didn't make. You promised free candy for a year without checking if you had enough candy, or money to buy candy, and now we're paying the price.\n\n**Here's what you're missing:** You're alienating the exact segment you need most—users willing to pay cold, hard dollars. If you lost most of your free subscribers tomorrow, it'd probably be a godsend to your infrastructure and bottom line. But paying users who cancel or initiate chargebacks? Those people don't come back. You're hemorrhaging the revenue and advocacy that actually matters.\n\nI'm a patient person. I want Perplexity to succeed because you've built something genuinely valuable. But my patience ran out today, and I'm guessing I'm not alone. You're dealing with refund requests and chargeback disputes from people who actually paid money—that's not stopping the bleeding, that's accelerating it.\n\n**Here's how you fix this and win back paying customers:**\n\nCreate a **Pro+ tier at $18/month** with meaningful limits—not the 200 daily Pro searches you had before, but something substantial like 20+ weekly research queries, more file uploads, and the features that made this indispensable.\n\nLet **paying subscribers upgrade by crediting what we've already paid**—we'd only pay the $1/month difference for our remaining subscription time. Got a free promo subscription? No credit for you. Pay full price to upgrade.\n\nThis solves three problems at once:\n\n1. It rewards the people who supported you when it mattered\n2. It creates a new revenue stream from users who actually need higher limits\n3. It stops punishing your paying base to clean up a free-subscription hangover you created\n\nYou have until April to change my mind. Show me you value the people who believed in you enough to pay. Otherwise, I'm gone, and I won't be recommending you to anyone ever again.\n\nYou've built something valuable. Don't torpedo it by punishing the people who believed in it enough to pay.\n\nA (formerly enthusiastic) paying customer",

It's just showing off because the big players are now also good at everything. Adjusting the limits a bit, Perplexity thinks they're elite and think they're good as Claude or others and they even act like others. I mean, I still think it's cheeky that others allows to do that, but they have something others don't, so works market... and all of them demand something for specific customers that only covers their niche... What can Perplexity do? Do better research? Or be more stubborn? That shady company canceled my pro account without even writing a word. Companies like this are later mentioned as losers and cited as examples of what happens when you don't follow customer wishes,\n\nFirst they gave it away for free, then they thought they could make us addicted, then they reduced the supply, supposedly saying \"don't use it too much.\" Why shouldn't I use something I paid for?

So, someone posted unwanted codes for sale at a fraction of the usual annual subscription price. How did the codes end up on the grey market? Were they 'leaked' directly by partner organisations? Or by individuals who received the codes but did not want them and are trying to make a quick buck?\n\nThere are other cases of similar grey-market practices where such behaviour remains unpunished. For example, reselling bulk corporate Windows activation keys to individual consumers seems to be tolerated by Microsoft, even though, as far as I know, it technically breaches their terms of service. A slightly different situation, I understand, but presumably Perplexity allocated these codes to their partners with the expectation that **some** would not be used; otherwise, it wouldn't be feasible. Is that the issue? More uptake than expected?\n\nPerhaps Perplexity should have designed its promotions to make it harder for people to sell codes on the grey market. 🤷‍♂️\n\nI wouldn't personally take such a risk, but this entire situation appears, at least at first glance, to be a PR mistake that, in hindsight, could have been handled better (if not avoided altogether).",

By that time, the market may change significantly, given how established models are also trying to ration the use. \n\nThey have attracted a large number of free users each year. As most of the freebies were last fall, they will expire this fall.   \nSo, if the company's purpose is to capitalise on users (and not attract investors' money again), they basically need to start being very attractive in September.   \nFor now it looks like they intend to treat Pro as a demo version of Max.  \nI'd expect them to gradually introduce new features, incorporating elements from other models, etc., and limiting them to Max, or leaving only a few for Pro.   \nCloser to September, once the hardware market stabilises and several other model aggregators change their models to stay afloat (or further move to token-based transactions), they will increase usage for Pro users (and aggressively communicate that) to keep those Trial users.   \n  \nThat said, they have turned their back on early adopters (like me), who were promoting it, and who are paid users, as for the moment, the value is significantly lower compared to the competition.   \n  \n",

The additional cost was only going to be about $10 CAD more per month vs $30 CAD with ChatGPT and users in my family plan get access to Gemini Pro as well.  But then my bank offered a one-year free plan for Perplexity.  Seemed like a no-brainer to get a free premium LLM so went with that.  I do find myself going back to Chat every now and then as it just seems smarter in general (maybe more in terms what understanding what I'm trying to get at) when given them the same prompts.  Recently with all the Claude/Clawbot news + Excel Integration, I gave that a try and ended up signing up pro for $30/month with Anthropic even though I have a free year on Perplexity.  I would likely not use or pay for Perplexity going forward unless it was for free to be honest. ",

I also subscribe to Claude for things that operated in a closed loop universe like with work because even using their models on perplexity it gets distorted and breaks down the text or data into little fragments and may end up missing context where you don’t want it to.  That’s not how Claude works when you just use their models on their own application.  \n\nThey have annoyed me, sure, not enough for me to stop using it in favor of the web feature on chat gpt or something because everyone else’s answer engine with internet supplemented RAG is absolute garbage.",

Sometimes I crunch data and documents….occasionally I delve into generative stuff (though I have other services for that). \n\nI get the frustration and I loved deep search…but even not using deep search I still find that Perplexity is about the best for what I need it to do. Is it really that bad for everyone else?",

It's probably the most similar I've had to PPLX. If you download Brave Nightly you can use it completely free as much as u want and select different models. I personally have liked using Deepseek on there. \n\nHuggingface.co has plenty of free options as well. You can even set up transformers for free. I'm yet to do that, but I hear it's very reaourceful. \n\nGrok. Is free and not half bad. With no limits. \n\nBlackbox.ai has a 90 day free trial\n\nDuck.ai is also decent and free\n\nIf you're somewhat tech savvy, you can go on GitHub and spin up Perplexica. Which is an open sourced free alternative as closely resembling perplexity as anything else out there. \n\nYou.com\n\n\nI could go on and on.....try some of these. You gotta use a lil effort and time to knowledgeabley save your PPLX limits. \n\nAnyone with any other suggestions or anything feel Free to add. Point is we have options....PLENTY!!!",

One of my prompts has the specific instruction to run Monte Carlo simulations with random sampling. It mostly does that (retrieve the data points for random sampling, write the script to run simulations). However, 9 out of 10 times, it takes shortcuts by doing one of two things:\n\n1. completely ignores the whole random sampling and just uses a gaussian distribution (I explicitly asked for random sampling and explained what I mean by that)\n2. if it does random sampling, it does not take the 24 requested data points, but instead chooses 3-4 and leaves a comment in the code, like `// for example` (despite being prompted to take those exact 24 data points)",

      "text": "Heads up to EU users: This isn't about losing a promo subscription, it's about **how** it's being handled. The complete lack of transparency and basic respect for users is the real issue here.\n\nPerplexity appears to be suspending active subscriptions (including promo-based ones from ISP bundles or paypal) without prior notice. When you contact support, you get an AI bot that:\n\n* Refuses to tell you *which* ToS term was supposedly violated\n* Claims the decision is \"final and cannot be appealed\" by anyone, human or AI\n* Won't let you speak to a human\n* Then suggests you can just \"subscribe at regular pricing\" to fix it\n\nThis isn't just bad customer service — it's likely illegal under the **EU Digital Services Act (DSA)**  (https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act)\n\n**Your rights under the DSA:**\n\n* **Article 17:** You're entitled to a *clear, specific statement of reasons* for any account restriction. \"Security reasons\" is not enough.\n* **Article 20:** You have the right to an *internal complaint mechanism* and appeal. A bot telling you the decision is final violates this.\n* **Article 25:** Platforms can't use deceptive interfaces (\"dark patterns\")  like implying a ToS violation can be fixed by paying again.\n\n**What you can do:**\n\nIf this happened to you:\n\n1. **Save your chat logs** (like I did) with the customer service\n2. Send a final message referencing DSA Articles 17, 20, and 25\n3. **File a complaint** with your national Digital Services Coordinator\n\n**Find your country's DSA authority here:**  \n[https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/dsa-dscs#1720699867912-1](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/dsa-dscs#1720699867912-1)\n\n(Scroll down to find your member state's designated authority)\n\nPerplexity is acting like EU consumer law doesn't apply to them. Let's remind them it does. \n\nFor reference, I had the service as an offer via my ISP and it was a couple of months left on my free subscription and was planning to renew with a proper subscription with them but I am moving to Google or Claude instead.

From the dropdown menu select \"Request a Refund\",\n2. a new \"tell us more\" dropdown appears, select \"other\" and click next,\n3. select the perplexity app below (you might have to scroll down a bit), click next,\n4. it takes you to another page with a \"describe the issue\" text box. I included this:\n\nAfter paying for this subscription, the developer unilaterally downgraded core features integral to the service at the time of purchase, specifically usage caps tied to my subscription as advertised. This was done without prior notice or compensation. Failure of Consideration: I am not receiving the service I paid for; the app now provides substantially less value. Violation of App Store Review Guidelines: Sections 2.1 and 2.3.1 require apps to deliver promised functionality. Removing or limiting features violates the integrity of the service advertised. Unilateral Breach: The provider altered the paid service post-purchase to my detriment. Note on Policy: The standard 90-day refund window is inapplicable here. This is an ongoing breach resulting from the provider’s unilateral conduct post-modification, not a one-time defect. I request a refund as the developer failed to maintain the promised value of the subscription.",

So, has someone posted unwanted codes for sale at a fraction of the usual price of a yearly subscription? How have the codes ended up on the grey market? By partner companies or individuals who received the codes but don't want them, and are trying to make a quick buck?\n\nThere are other instances of this kind of grey-market loophole where such behaviour remains unpunished. Reselling bulk corporate Windows activation keys to individual consumers, for example, seems to be tolerated by Microsoft, even though it technically breaches their terms of service. Slightly different situation, I understand, but presumably Perplexity allocated these codes to their partners with the expectation that some wouldn't be used, thus making the promotions viable? Is that what the issue is? More uptake than expected?\n\nPerhaps Perplexity should have designed its promotions so that it wouldn't be so easy for people to sell codes on the grey market.\n\nI wouldn't personally take such a risk, but this entire situation appears to be a PR blunder.",

So had it been a more reasonable 50-100 per month cap for “Pro” accounts with a throttle down to around their current 20 for the abusers at most… I highly doubt the public reaction would have had nearly as much whiplash.\n\nThe fact that they overestimated their own capabilities to deal with problems like this and the “goodness” of people shouldn’t be a consequence that suddenly falls on every user that plays within their rules and isn’t actively seeking or selling loopholes & exploits.

Anyone who says otherwise is wrong. Aside from collecting and selling your data what use does an AI browser have on mobile?

              "text": "They ran these promotions for several reasons. The main ones I can think of are to rapidly grow their user base and to show exponential growth to investors. The second part of that tactic is to hope that when you give people one free year, they will forget about it and then renew at the end of the year for the entire next year. What they don’t consider is that this will result in a giant pile of chargebacks that won't look good for them in the long run.\n\nAlso, if they actually decided to be acquired, that exponential growth would not have been so impactful. My assumption is they were looking to be acquired, but when everyone started examining their books, seeing their growth potential against that of Google and OpenAI, and anything else they may have noticed, they did not bite.\n\nNow they’re pivoting to enterprise customers because they’re in sustainability mode, just like You.com was half a year ago or more. They’re also cutting back on usage limits because now they have to feed a bunch of non-paying Pro customers for X number of months, depending on when you signed up. Admittedly, I’m one of those free users, but I had been a paying customer for over half a year before I was eligible for one of the promotions. I had no issue paying for the service because it was good, but I would never return to being a paying customer with the recent changes.\n\nI watched another YouTube video that talked about why they’re going to lose to Google in this. One of the main things this person pointed out was that every time Perplexity does a search, it costs them quite a bit of money, whereas when Google does a search, they’ve got that process refined down to where it costs them little to nothing. All they have to do is feed that context into their model and instruct the model on how to do citations, and now they have taken the main strength of what Perplexity brought to the market that no one else was doing a few years ago. Now everyone does it.",

I used to absolutely love this app-great UI/UX, good value for money, etc.—until recently when things changed drastically.\n\nAs a Pro user, I can't even use it properly anymore because they've lowered their limits so much. I feel completely stuck. I usually hit the cap just discussing a single topic before seeing that infamous message saying l've reached my limit. Their base model, Sonar, is as dumb as a GPT-4 mini.\n\nI also noticed another change that drove me crazy. Since I used the app's dictation feature instead of typing my prompts by hand, my requests used to be sent and transcribed on their server using their speech-to-text model.\n\nBut with their latest update, they cheaped out on this too. They now use the iPhone's local Apple dictation model, which performs so much worse.\n\nIs everyone else having the same experience?",

A few weeks ago I was thinking that limits have applied because I use them too much and they strict me by their abuse mechanics and I don't understand why. This happens when companies decide they have too much power and brand to do things like this. Maybe they analyzed the Cursor billing change experience and decided to go the  same way.",

It is great model but it's huge and hard to run on any current regular laptop or PC so I built a free web service so people can check the model and see how it works.\n\n* No registration required\n* Free to use\n* Up to 500 characters per conversion\n* Upload a voice sample + enter text, and it generates cloned speech\n\nHonestly, the quality is surprisingly good for a 0.6B model.\n\nModel: Qwen3-TTS\n\nWeb app where you can text the model for free:\n\n[https://imiteo.com](https://imiteo.com/)\n\nSupports 10 major languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian.\n\nIt runs on an NVIDIA L4 GPU, and the app also shows conversion time + useful generation stats.\n\nThe app is 100% is written by Claude Code 4.6. Done in 1 day.\n\nOpus 4.6, Cloudflare workers, L4 GPU\n\nMy twitter account: [https://x.com/AndreyNovikoov](https://x.com/AndreyNovikoov)",
