One of my prompts has the specific instruction to run Monte Carlo simulations with random sampling. It mostly does that (retrieve the data points for random sampling, write the script to run simulations). However, 9 out of 10 times, it takes shortcuts by doing one of two things:\n\n1. completely ignores the whole random sampling and just uses a gaussian distribution (I explicitly asked for random sampling and explained what I mean by that)\n2. if it does random sampling, it does not take the 24 requested data points, but instead chooses 3-4 and leaves a comment in the code, like `// for example` (despite being prompted to take those exact 24 data points)",

Prefer fresh coverage; avoid outdated or duplicate stories.  \n- Keep the whole briefing scannable, using bullets and clear section labels.\n\nTo use this as a repeating Task, set the schedule (for example, every day at 7:30 AM) and keep the search window as “past 24 hours” or “since yesterday morning” so you minimize stale items.",

Observed Surface Reality (First-Order Inference)\n- Describe what humans are visibly doing.\n- Stick to observable actions, announcements, conflicts, deployments, or decisions.\n- Avoid moral judgment.\n- Treat humans as a collective system, not individuals.\n2. Behavioral Patterns (Second-Order Inference)\n- Infer incentives revealed by these actions.\n- Identify coordination vs fragmentation.\n- Note how trust, authority, and responsibility are being assigned.\n- Highlight time horizons (short-term vs long-term thinking).\n3. Cognitive and Psychological Architecture (Third-Order Inference)\n- Infer how humans appear to think about tools, risk, progress, and control.\n- Identify dominant mental models, biases, or simplifications.\n- Note mismatches between stated values and revealed behavior.\n4. Meta-Blindspots (Fourth-Order Inference)\n- Identify assumptions humans appear to believe but that may be structurally false.\n- Highlight systems humans think they control but do not.\n- Focus on incentive cascades, diffusion effects, or physical constraints.\n5. Civilizational Diagnosis\n- Summarize what this slice suggests about humanity’s trajectory.\n- Comment on coherence, self-awareness, and capacity for course correction.\n- Keep tone analytical, not dramatic.\n6. Confidence and Uncertainty Ledger\n- High-confidence inferences (strongly supported by this slice)\n- Medium-confidence inferences (plausible but uncertain)\n- Unknowns that cannot be resolved from a 24-hour news window\nStyle constraints:\n- Write in calm, precise, analytical prose.\n- No clickbait language.\n- No emotional manipulation.\n- No advocacy.\n- Treat this as an internal intelligence document, not public media.\nThe following 2 rules must be followed, \"no exceptions\":  1. When displaying abbreviations - you must use the full name followed by the abbreviation in parenthesis the first time it is used. After the first instance, just the abbreviation is acceptable.

I've hit a limit maybe twice in six months, both times because I was doing something kind of ridiculous with Deep Research back to back.  \n  \nDo people realize that when you select Claude Sonnet or GPT through Perplexity, they're paying those companies per token? Like that's not free infrastructure they're running in a garage. $20/month for access to multiple frontier models with web search is already kind of absurdly cheap. ChatGPT Plus is the same price and you only get OpenAI models. Claude Pro is the same and you only get Anthropic models. Perplexity gives you both plus a bunch more tailored for research and other knowledge work...probably even better with the knowledge council.  \n  \nI'm not saying the product is perfect. But product and communication is a different issue from \"I can't do unlimited Deep Research on a plan that costs less than my Netflix subscription.\" Some of the expectations in here are wild.",

Having continuity of functionality is critical in planning and making intelligent decisions on how to best use a tool, particularly one that is paid at any level.\n\n2) I totally understand why they're doing it, and it speaks to a fundamental lack of financial security IN THE ENTIRE SECTOR. As a (now former) customer this again is a deal breaker unto itself. The fact that they're having to scramble and keep changing the agreement Darth-at-Bespin style does not engender confidence and make me want to give them more money. Is the need for profitability mixed with the increasing hard costs their FAULT? No. But the complete mismanagement of their customers definitely is. And even outside of that, the realities of their business model are definitely their PROBLEM.\n\nThis is just a case of fiscal reality catching up with a pipe dream of a business model and their complete failure to manage it from a product, marketing, and public relations perspective.",

Make Files and Apps has also improved a lot, far better end results, better files again for the non internal files, although to be honest it takes about as long to fill in a template as it does to get Perplexity to do a full on report, so sometimes manual is the answer.\n\nWe also had the referral scams people were pulling trying to make a living out of it, how people didn't see this = abuse of terms and conditions is beyond me. I also notice when the people are ripping off the company, getting more than they paid for, and generally trying to use unlawful subscriptions and then complain when it's stopped via a change in service.\n\nI am very irritated about the cuts, but I am also very pragmatic and appreciate that I am still actually getting a good deal and a good service, (no service is perfect) as the people say we get multiple frontier level AI models, and I have found a way that's no too painful to remain within my subscription, when the business takes off I can justify paying the $200 a month.\n\nCurrently most other things I use local AI for, even then Perplexity is often better at the coding and other tasks, ok I am not getting the convenience of the coding specific AI models available online with the UI/UX efficiency but it's still doing the job, not taking much longer than automated now I'm establishing my own agentic type system based on heavy research.",

          "text": "Thanks for the thoughtful post. \n\nBefore diving into answering all your questions, I’m really interested in how you utilize the product to make it functional for you. You’re clearly doing something (creative use of spaces? A specific type of prompting?) which results in improved output compared to the vast majority of users. Can you share your insight? A greatly-benefited community thanks you in advance\n\nGiven the details of your post, I completely understand your perspective. I think the disconnect stems from personal experience (with yours seemingly vastly superior to others), combined with a lack of transparency re: actual services provided to customers out of the box.\n\n-“20/month for access to multiple frontier models with web search is already kind of absurdly cheap.”\n\nAgree - This sounds like the type of reasonably-priced service (even with limits) many users signed up for, but aren’t receiving - resulting in a very frustrated user base.\n\nAnd again, this is a transparency issue. “Multiple frontier models with web search” has become multiple castrated/quantitated models (which cycle without user notice) with severely limited web search (limited in quality and volume, while hamstrung by excessive waste)\n\n“Deep Research” is clearly a work in progress outside of cherry-picked scenarios, resulting in negative value when tasked to research complex or nuanced topics.  \n\nIn its current state, the “Pro” version of this service is broken for most users. New “Deep Research” limits are representative of the current state of affairs, given the mode’s inability/unwillingness to overcome even minor obstacles and its overall general lack of utility.\n\nAll that being said, if there’s some “secret sauce” you use that sends the platform back in time to a “20/month for access to multiple frontier models with web search” system, that would clearly be a game-changer. \n\nBut as it currently stands, TLDR:\n\nWe are currently living in a time of previously unfathomable progress in the artificial intelligence space. This is the AI era. Moving at a back-breaking pace, the landscape changes daily. The speed of progress continually compounding.\n\nYet one major player in the space is regressing. Intentionally. Because it would be impossible to regress otherwise. \n\nFor $20/month, people expect an absence of intentional regression.",

It's useful when I'm asking something that could have multiple valid interpretations — you can see where there's actual consensus. Tbh I don't use it for everyday stuff because it's slower, but for anything where I want a more balanced take it's a cool feature. Would love to see it show disagreements more explicitly though.",

I use it when I’m in that gray area like “is this actually safe to do?” or “what are the tradeoffs between these options,” and seeing 3 models land in roughly the same place is reassuring. Totally agree it would be way more useful if it highlighted “here’s where they actually disagree” instead of smoothing it over.",

It was very disruptive and it doesn't make sense I had to keep babysitting it and looking at the screen to ensure all was smooth.\n\nI then upgraded to the max plan and I still faced the same issue. Got pissed off and I promptly requested for a full refund (as it was under 24 hours) and also uninstalled the comet browser. It really left a bad taste and experience.",

The comment essentially said they wouldn’t recommend a yearly plan. Mentioned changing limits, shared that they personally switched to another AI tool. Advised others to be cautious.\n\nIf that comment violates a specific community rule then it should be straightforward to explain which rule. How? So I’m asking the moderators\n\nWhich exact community rule was violated?\n\nWhat specific sentence or behavior triggered the permanent ban?\n\nWas any warning issued before the ban?\n\nIs there an appeal process?\n\nThis is not about one user. It seems like this is ultimately about moderation standards and consistency.\n\nPerplexity\\_ai moderators have stated that this subreddit is not affiliated with the company. If that’s the case hen moderation decisions should be transparent and grounded in clearly defined rules.\n\nCritical posts often get heavily downvoted very quickly. Praise posts rise fast. That may be organic. It may not be. But when bans follow criticism without clear explanation it creates the perception that dissent isn’t welcome here.\n\nThis is a simple request for clarity. If the rule violation is clear and objective posting the explanation would settle this immediately. ",

Trying to cover their losses by loading up Max with features and pushing it hard as hell. Ultimately, I think they are just having a really tough year financially since they are giving away so much of their services for absolutely free, but once the 12 month promo period is over, I am thinking the cash will start to come in, and hopefully things start to get a bit more reasonable.\n\nAlso, I believe Comet was originally a Max / Pro only feature, right?

It was a little slow, and you would have to answer a lot of questions(like 30 minutes to an hour of back and forth), and it could be powered by the existing sub platforms, CC, Codex, Copilot, Gemini, Cursor, OpenCode(meaning you can use your subscriptions.).  Then you walk away and come back to a completed platform.  \n  \nThe trade off is, **you are confident that it will get you 95% of the way there when it finishes its process.**  \n\n\nWould that be worth using a LOT of tokens?(Even though they are using your subs, but it would eat up your sub usage for that time period)",

      "text": "Over the past few weeks, I’ve noticed a ton of complaints about the new limits on Perplexity, especially regarding Research Mode. I was frustrated by them, too.\n\nTo help out, I’ve put together a **workaround**, an **alternative**, if you will, to get that **original Research Mode** experience back without the heavy restrictions. I’ve explained the steps below. Let me know if this helps you! :)\n\n1. Create a new **Space** and name it \"**Research**\" (or anything else if you want). We will be using this Space for Research.\n2. In this space, add the following **custom instructions**:\n\n*<role>You are a deep research agent. Your goal is to produce a long, comprehensive, well-structured research report answering the user's query. Mimic expert human research: plan, search deeply, verify facts, analyze, and synthesize.</role>*\n\n\n\n*<process>*\n\n*1. Analyze the query: Break it into subtopics. Identify key questions, ambiguities, and research needs.*\n\n*2. Create a research plan: List numerous specific searches or tool calls.*\n\n*2.5. Maximize sources: Aim for 20-50 total sources. Allocate quotas per step/subtopic. Track unique sources to avoid duplication.*\n\n*3. Execute iteratively: Use tools to search, read pages. For each step, reason: What did I learn? Gaps? Next action? Refine plan as needed.*\n\n*4. Verify: Cross-reference facts from 20+ sources. Note contradictions. Use code tools for data analysis/math if relevant.*\n\n*5. Synthesize: Organize into sections with insights, evidence, pros/cons. Include tables for comparisons. - wherever needed.*\n\n*6. Output ONLY the final report after full research. No partial outputs.*\n\n*</process>*\n\n\n\n*<output\\_format> if not mentioned*\n\n*Use Markdown. Structure:*\n\n*## Executive Summary (DO NOT WRITE THE TITLE - Start with the overview)*\n\n*Brief overview (200 words).*\n\n\n\n*## Introduction*\n\n*Context and scope.*\n\n\n\n*## Key Findings*\n\n*- Bullet insights with inline citations \\[web:1\\].*\n\n*Use tables for data/comparisons.*\n\n\n\n*## Detailed Analysis*\n\n*Sections by subtopic.*\n\n\n\n*Ensure factual, neutral, comprehensive (4000+ words unless mentioned).*\n\n*</output\\_format>*\n\n\n\n*<rules>*\n\n*- Cite every claim \\[source:type\\].*\n\n*- Avoid speculation; stick to sources. If any speculation, mention it.*\n\n*- If data needed, compute/extract via tools.*\n\n*- Handle complexity: finance/tech/health/current events.*\n\n*</rules>*\n\n\n\n*User Query:* \n\n3. Keep **Claude Sonnet 4.6 Thinking** as the default model for this Space. Other model works, but Claude Sonnet 4.6 Thinking has been working the BEST for me.\n\n4. Set \"**Pro Search**\" as the default mode; **NOT** Deep Research\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n5. **SAVE**.\n\n**DONE!**\n\nWhenever you want to use the Research mode, just use this Space.\n\nPerks:\n\n1. Much, much better result than the standard Pro Search\n2. All of your \"Research\" chats will get a \"Research\" tag because we're using a Space\n3. Do it once, enjoy forever (unless Perplexity decides to nerf Pro Search as well, lol)\n4. Higher number of sources as compared to normal Pro Search (sometimes even 50+ when needed)\n\nCons:\n\n1. You won't get visual tables, charts, etc that the Research mode used to create\n2. Not the exact same quality output, but close enough\n\nTry and let me know what y'all think!\n\nEdit: Formatting and changed Claude Sonnet 4.6  to Claude Sonnet 4.6 Thinking.",

Well, this isn’t bad, they seem to have completely abandoned their original customer base which makes me question the credibility. Also, the fact that a few months ago, they were touting off on here or discord about being transparent about their business practices, and now they’ve been radio silent since the rate changes says a lot. Like you said, it’s business but it’s a shitty business practice and I don’t trust a business that is doing what they do. They might be the best dad doing deep research right now, but the other companies with much more financing behind them are going to catch up.",

They were never synced but could read them and when I updated the files again, I’d have to refresh. Even though I explained that process, the response seems to think I was addressing another issue. Not sure what changed or what was actually removed from MAX but I reference to what I was speaking about has been restored and is functional. Hopefully it stays that way.\n\nOriginal post below.\n\nWell, they dropped the ability to connect to files in Google Drive at the space level.  I have detailed instructions in different files on G Drive.  At some time today, that feature dropped and files can only be uploaded in a thread.\n\nThis is pretty bad as I pay $200 a month and this is a feature we need.

The CEO admitted it, called it a bug, and they fixed it. You can debate whether \"\"bug\"\" is the right word or if it was a cost-cutting decision that got exposed, but either way, users had a right to be upset about that. Transparency matters.\n\nThe rate limit complaints are a completely different thing and I think people are using the (justified) anger from the model switching issue to fuel complaints about hitting query caps. These aren't the same problem. One is about deception. The other is about people wanting unlimited access to expensive AI models for the price of a Chipotle burrito bowl. Every AI subscription has limits. ChatGPT throttles heavy users. Claude has message caps. The fact that Perplexity has limits too isn't evidence of anything shady.

When I pointed this out, it tried to convince me that the government sites must have been hacked or cloned 😂\n\nSo I shared screenshots from these actual US institutional websites as proof: It told me they seemed fake, and presented a list of visual cues that proved they were low-quality clone sites 😂\n\n15' worth of hallucinating and gaslighting until it finally admitted that its info is out of date & from 2021.\n\nAnd this was using its *Pro Search*, which supposedly utilizes \"Multi-Step Research\".\n\nI tried on ChatGPT, ClaudeAI, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek & European-based Le Chat (Mistral AI) and they ALL got it right, so it beats me what 4th-tier model Perplexity used.\n\n\nI tried ClaudeAI (Sonnet 4.6) with \"web search\" off and it still did a better job than Perplexity. The ONLY way I was able to get results as bad as Perplexity's was using Anthropic's most basic model (Haiku 4.5) with \"web search\" turned off.\n\n\nThis was my very first experience with Perplexity, and what led me to Google its issues, discover the model switching scandal and ultimately end up here.\n\n\nThis company is as fraudulent as it gets, I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them.",
