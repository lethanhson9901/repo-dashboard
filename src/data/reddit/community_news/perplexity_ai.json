How I found that promo might provide some insight into what is happening here.\n\nI'm in the U.S. but I talk to people all over, generally they're from the OSINT realm. An associate in a developing country sent me a list of \"how to get free AI stuff\" and I noticed the Perplexity offer in there. All of the rest of the tips involved \"VPN to country X and make false claim Y in order to get service Z\", or other methods of abusing promotional offers.\n\nI'd rather not be spending the $160/month I'm putting into various services, but access and mastery are key for my business, so I do what is needed. I get why people in countries where the average salary is under $1k are willing to play games. I think we are at a serious inflection point in terms of access - providing inference costs in a way that the advertising funded internet does not. We are going to see a stark haves/have nots divide once the VC willingness to burn cash in exchange for showing user acquisition cools, and that's probably going to land hard in first quarter of next year.\n\nI think a lot of the sour grapes I see here are people who abused signup procedures and got caught. If you truly need it, you've got a week to find the link, provide a Paypal account, and settle in to another year of free use. I think we're going to look back on 2025 as the golden period of freebies, and I'm glad I noticed this one in time to take advantage of it.",

Short term gains do not always add up to a good long term solution.\n\nI had this conversation within Gemini after reading this thread.  Gemini basically stated even if you pay the consumer subscription, you are still a guinea pig in the system that is being harvested.  You have to be a enterprise level customer to have your privacy respected.  It speaks volumes about Googles attitude to individual consumers.",

If I'm reading docs, comparing products, or trying to get a clean summary of what happened with some company or paper for my financial work, I've basically stopped using Google. And I've made everything else feel like a supporting tool.\n\nGoing into 2026, curious what this sub's setup looks like in reality.

Google Drive storage, and best image and video generation models. \n\n2. ChatGPT Plus: Why? Good at everything(Although not great at anything). Best memory feature and reasoning overall. Best for personal chats, everyday chats, answers, work, etc…An essential…and best access and selection of third party connectors. Great deep research feature. \n\n(I get pro during times of heavy research and when my use case and usage limit increases) \n\n3. Perplexity. Why? My Google replacement for every searches, definitions, fact checking, prices, updates etc…\n\n\nThen there’s other AI tools or Apps with AI features: \n\nWispr flow or Superwhisper for diction(speech to text) \n(I’ve used both but wispr flow is easier to use and cross platform capable, but Superwhisper is Mac only and more customizable) \n\nNota AI for transcription (much better than Otter AI eve through Otter is more popular). Otter AI is the better alternative for its iOS App but Nota is more accurate and gives your more usage limits and features. \n\nFyxer or superhuman or email management and organization. Kind of like the difference between wispr flow and Superwhisper, although both fyxer and superhuman are cross platform capable. Fyxer is easier to use and more convenient but superhuman has more features and is more customizable. \n\nGrammarly for editing text and the app and chrome extension being built in makes editing text much more intuitive and convenient. Still the best app overall for writing, editing, etc…it genuinely makes writing better and the new AI features are an added bonus. While all the top 5 Chatbots can edit writing, they always sound robotic and inhuman. Grammarly is like having a professional editor edit your work and give you feedback.",

And btw now they have it for 50% off in the annual subscription. \n\nWithin 1.5 years Gemini procured 600+ million users.

I have Perplexity Pro for research and Gemini Pro more for the size than anything else - although, in reality I just like playing with photos and videos on GP3.\n\nYour post hit hard with me. The juggling comment is true. The muscle memory for me is CoPilot and I am forcing Gemini into my life but it does have value for me because some of my work files are large and CoPilot's upload limits make it difficult at times with some of my tasks. \n\nI usually start something CoPilot or Perplexity and throw it against the other two to get an aggregate response. It helps me understand what I am actually asking but also helps me see where their \"Memory\" may be limiting me in my efforts to optimize. Ultimately, on a given task I get a refined aggregate response. Surprisingly on one of my major work tasks, Gemini got me the response that was the most useful. \n\nThe reality is I am going to have to get back to what brought me into this chaos, CoPilot. I spent some time yesterday investigating what I use it for, and basically \"justify your existence to me\" for how I currently use the platform, and what low hanging fruit in my workflow should I be doing more of to save time. \n\nI started down all of this to save time in the mundane and the reality is I am doing more \"juggling\" than saving time. Specifically with Perplexity, I have had pro (paid) for a little over a month and I have spent more time in between a little bit of useful research trying to optimize my use of Perplexity and how to make it produce for me workflow. I don't hit limits everyone complains about but I have noticed it get more restrictive and \"dumber\". \n\nSo my plan is to scale back migrate my spaces in Perplexity Pro and Gems in Gemini Pro to CoPilot. Scale back to the Perplexity Free and Gemini Free and see what hurts the most.\n\nMy very uneducated opinion is 2026 is going to be an interesting year to see what develops and I think there will be a massive culling of the herd with people asking the same questions and coming to some realizations about what they think they are getting vs. what they are actually getting. It's not that ai is not a great development - its Neanderthals' like me that limit it's abilities.  \n\nI think the big ones will start grabbing capacity and power generation like they are already starting to do. They are going to hit hard limits on both and money is going to talk. \n\nI have to get back to work/putting reindeer antlers on my recent photo....",

      "text": "I’ve bounced between pretty much every major AI tool this year, but the two I keep coming back to are Gemini and Perplexity. Short version: I’ll keep a Gemini tab around in 2026 because I like to sanity-check things across models, but Perplexity is staying my main “workhorse” for anything that feels like actual research or day-to-day productivity. Especially with all the recent noise around Gemini, I felt like sharing my thoughts would be great and I would like to hear what others think as well. I'm sure this will get attraction of both sides, haters and lovers, as long as there's some good discussion. My problem with Gemini is simple: I don’t trust it with anything that matters. It’s flashy, sometimes clever, but it feels loose. It ignores instructions, drifts off into weird tangents, and hallucinates with way more confidence than I’m comfortable with. When I’m already tired, the last thing I want is to babysit an AI that keeps deciding it knows better than my prompt.\n\nPerplexity is not perfect, but it’s predictable enough that I can build real routines on top of it. Spaces are the second big thing for me. Being able to throw docs, PDFs, and links into one place and then treat that as a dedicated research pool changes how I prep for projects. I keep separate Spaces for work, side projects, and random rabbit holes. I don’t need to remember which chat had which link from three weeks ago. It’s all there, and I can keep querying it as the project evolves. Then there’s Comet. Having a browser that is built around this stuff instead of bolting AI on as an afterthought makes a difference. The built-in widgets, the way it handles search, the ability to keep research, browsing, and writing in the same environment without constant copy-paste gymnastics fits how I actually work. For long sessions, it feels like a proper “AI workstation” instead of just another tab. In 2026 I’ll keep checking Gemini whenever there’s a big update, because I like knowing what’s out there and sometimes it does give an angle I wouldn’t have considered. But I'll definitely keep PPLX in my rotation for next year",

          "text": "This is all very interesting to me to watch and engage in as it is happening and new developments drop almost weekly. \n\nI am a non-coder in the construction consulting business. I am finding there is a limit to Ai effectiveness from a time management perspective with reoccurring tasks. I started paying for Perplexity Pro a few months ago and looking into spaces. I now use a few spaces for work and a couple of health. \n\nSome of my files are pretty large and Gemini (also pay for pro) GEMS lets me upload the larger files and gives me very good responses. \n\nI have created my prompt for one major task and refined it by going back and forth between Gemini and Perplexity. It has gotten pretty good. It still needs a little tweaking but I am confident in the results I am getting so I am happy with that. \n\nOddly enough, I work in Microsoft and got into Ai through CoPilot. I quickly upgraded to Pro and was really excited to play with it and hopefully help me with my work, but have not found the pay off and may actually drop my subscription. It is not delivering - especially the ones embedded within Word, Excel, Outlook. \n\nI used Comet for a few weeks and really liked it and then I read some things about the security of it and got of out of it. I liked the functionality of it though. \n\nFor 2026 to me it is \"justify your existence\". I am going to do a time audit for a week on myself and act accordingly. I like my Ai toys for sure, but again, from a production standpoint, I am not sure. \n\nReading the tea leaves, and I fully acknowledge my statement may be completely unfounded or not realistic as I am not a IT or someone really knowledgeable in the Ai world.\n\nMoney is going to start winning out. I see the larger companies distancing themselves. The mad rush for energy is going to win and it is going to take big bucks to cover the gap until long term solutions are in place. I also think there will be consolidation and capacity purchasing. I also think the culture / energy impacts of all of this is going to get louder as we start to realize/accept the \"Cost\" of all of this mad rush in Ai Development. \n\nI think Gemini through it's google platform and CoPilot through it's Microsoft platform are going to be the most stable long term and they will start doing what they normally do and start restricting (if they have not already) how 3rd party platforms can interact with them, so they can protect their market share.  Again, my ignorance may be showing with this statement. \n\nI am thinking Perplexity has a place, but it seems to be losing it's way a little with value for Pro and not pushing everyone to their highest tier, and if they can get with Comet platform secure, this would be a huge win. \n\nI think Gemini will probably have some of the largest developments in 2026 but all of the shine in Ai is going to start wearing off except for the people in coding or specifically in the tech world. Schleps like me are only going to be able to use it so far. \n\nI think 2026 will also include more medical and mental/counseling type Ai platform development because the common joes are using it so much for this. \n\nI circle back around to my first statement. I don't remember an industry this dynamic with its development and it is a blast to live in it.",

Well, because it shows they are ignoring my instruction to use reasoning.\n\nPreviously, it carefully took it's time to answer but now it is an instant answer no matter what. The issue is that it's a worse answer every time. Reasoning reduces hallucination and increasing the model's ability to carefully consider all sources. But today the answers have just been plain wrong 60% of the time.\n\nI literally just asked it a question about the RTX 5070 just now and it replied with \"this is a hypothetical GPU but ...\"\n\nIf it was Gemini 3 Pro or GPT 5.2 Thinking it would have never replied arguing that the RTX 5070 is a hypothetical GPU. But even though I selected GPT 5.2 Thinking (also tried with Gemini 3 Pro), they both replied with the same answer. They are very shadily  ignoring the model selector.\n\nThese types of silly stumbles only happen when you don't use reasoning models. This is not my only issue today but it is the most recent one.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, the number of sources searched keeps reducing. Previously, it searched like 100 sources.

My job is accountant (Europe) , so regularly I’m searching about new laws (paid subscription from tax sites) , summarizing big documents (articles , or pdf) and when I’m struggling to find a solution through the tech support of my accounting program company , I tend to ask AI and most of the time I get the solution through a nice chat. Apart from that I have many hobbies such as guitar and coffee and I regularly ask ChatGPT about different topics , collecting and saving data and advising me.\n\nSince yesterday I subscribed to Perplexity Pro and because my budget is kind of low , I can’t have more than 2 paid subs. Which AI do you think it’s better for searching and discussing topics? A friend of mine advised me to go with Gemini (free version) , since whenever I need an answer I search on google, but I found it lacking info and very short answers.\n\nThank you for your time!",

          "text": "Honestly for your use case (accountant + hobbies) Perplexity Pro is a really solid “main brain.” You basically live in “search + big documents + long chats,” which is exactly where it does well. Comet then just wraps that around your normal browsing so you can open your tax sites, official EU docs, PDFs etc and ask questions right on top of the page instead of copying everything into a chat.\n\nIf your budget is tight I would keep Perplexity as the paid one and treat Gemini as the free sidekick. Gemini’s free tier is fine for casual stuff but if you already feel the answers are short and thin, making it your main tool for law research is going to be frustrating pretty fast.",

Perplexity just helps with “turn 40 pages of dense language into something I can actually act on.” Same for your accounting software issues: describe the situation and error in detail and it is surprisingly good at suggesting where to look in the settings or what you might be missing.\n\nI would not try to replace your subscriptions or technical support with AI, but as a layer in between “raw law” and “your brain,” Perplexity has been much more useful to me than Gemini.",

After enough reps, I've finally figured out where each one actually earns its keep.\n\n* **Perplexity** for research and quick answers. It just works. \n* **Claude** for building things. Spreadsheets, data extraction, reports, anything structured.\n* **Deep research** goes back to Perplexity, with Gemini as a backup. Gemini sounds smart but half the time it's just word vomit. Sophisticated language, zero actionable takeaway. I've tested this across hundreds of complex prompts (USPAP, asset management, market analysis) and it's consistent.\n* **GPT**? Can't even use it anymore. I used to love it. Now that I know what each tool is actually good at, there's just no reason to open it.\n\nI've tried simplifying the stack, dropping Perplexity, consolidating. Doesn't work. Once you stop fighting these tools and just lean into what each one does best, everything clicks. They start working for you instead of against you.\n\nOn the API side, we've gone deep: Claude handles our codebase, Perplexity powers research, GPT fills in the gaps. For structured responses, Perplexity wins hands down. From a valuation standpoint, it's been a game changer.\n\nI know Perplexity catches heat for certain things. But man, they've gotten a lot right. My two cents guys! Hopefully someone else can agree, they may not be perfect, but dang they've done some good stuff!",

          "text": "I’m sorry but if you have the highest tier for Gemini, Claud and ChatGPT then perplexity Max is not necessary. \n\nFor starters, you mentioned that for research, Perplexity works, but what type of research are you talking about? I agree that Perplexity is great for quick Google searches, definitions, quick fact-checking, and stuff like that or quick answers. But anything else, it's not as thorough, and its source selection is not as accurate and credible as Gemini and ChatGPT.\n\nAnd saying \"can't even use\" ChatGPT anymore because there's just no reason to \"open\" it. It just means you have not used ChatGPT to its fullest potential. Especially on the Pro plan. Try doing deep research with GPT 5.2 Pro model or GPT 5.2 Heavy Thinking. It's so much of a difference than regular deep research even in Gemini and especially in Perplexity. It's much better than those.\n\nNow Gemini Ultra is great for deep research because it shows nice infographics and organizes it nicely, and it has a nice layout to it. Gemini Ultra gives you the most features and quite frankly, use cases and usage limits out of all the high-end subscription tiers. But I have not heard anyone using Perplexity for deep research or research over Gemini or ChatGPT. Again, Perplexity is a great tool, but not for deep research or research. It's great for quick fact-checking, Google searches, small searches, stuff like that. So if they will use Google for everyday searches, Perplexity can be a replacement for that.\n\nAnd again, I've said this probably 30 times by now in this thread and this subreddit that you do not have access to all the models and Perplexity. You have access to a limited weekend version of those models with a limited content with a very small context window that a system prompted by Perplexity within the confines of Perplexity search deep research, and it's not that model itself at its fullest capacity and capability. So getting Gemini 3 Pro in Perplexity or GPT 5.2 thinking in Perplexity is not the same as getting them on their own respective chatbots. \n\nI would understand if getting the max here in Perplexity would help with Comet because of its usage limits. That would make sense, but Claude max is also a waste of money as well because it runs out because his usage limits are far inferior to ChatGPT Pro and Gemini ultra.\n\nNow you said you code, for coding it makes sense. \nBut I'm just talking generally, besides Gemini Ultra and ChatGPT Pro. If you have those two, you don't need anything else. Honestly, now, if you don't want to pay that much for subscriptions, then I will still get Gemini Pro Chat and ChatGPT Pro, and then throw in Perplexity Pro. But ChatGPT Pro, I think it's an essential in the high-end subscription tiers simply because of the usage limits, access to the pro model, and the fact that it would essentially help you make ChatGPT others yours. Your go-to for work as well. \n\nBecause think about it, if you're going to have 400 Agentic tasks and 250 deep research queries per month, then why not use ChatGPT Atlas? I've tried this, having ChatGPT Pro with, and then using ChatGPT Atlas is just crazy, and it makes the experience so much better. \n\nMy advice for anyone that wants to get the highest subscription tier for AI and any of these chatbots (besides Gemini ultra and ChatGPT pro), the rest are not worth it now. Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro would get the job done. If you want to have Claude and Perplexity, you don't need their max tiers.",

People will use a trial for 30 days, but it won't break their habit.  How do I know?  I'll give you a guess, i did some research with a good AI and it gave me the references to back it up.  Goes like this.\n\n1 get users on board at all costs. Burn VC$.  Get them using the product to the point they don't want to use Google Search any more.  (I got there  in about a week)  \n2 work out how to introduce ads that don't piss people off.     \n3. Shed the freeloaders.\n\nThey have some unique challenges.  Their target market is not \"what' the capital of France\", it's in-depth, complex queries.  Their user base tends to be more tech savvy, and with a higher disposable income.  The demographic has a *five times higher* online spend than the average.  So Perplexity users should be a highly sought after target.\n\nthere's two issues with that.  Firstly, on average, 1 in 3 people block ads.  In the high spend demographic it's 1 in 2 - we are much harder to target with advertising.  We don't like cheap collab deals (15% off Uber Eats for example) that are transparently costing the company nothing and are just another form of advertising.  The percentage of Linux, and Firefox users, is higher too, users who can completely block whatever they want unlike Chrome / Edge.  Our more complex queries carry a higher cost per user on average too.\n\nSo here you have a service specifically servicing a high spending demographic, that hates being marketed to, and costs more per user.\n\nHope that sheds some light on what's going on.  If in doubt, ask Perplexity the right questions, think critically, challenge all its assumptions and assertions and check the references.  If you can't, you're probably in the wrong r/.",

But over the last two weeks, the quality has been terrible. I went through all the effort of creating new Gems from scratch for my work only to face an extreme drop in quality. Chats which worked fine with 2.5 pro now fail all the time with 3.0 models. Refuses to follow my instructions, keeps lying about using context from previous chats (double checked to see if I had that setting on), ignores uploaded files, and also lies about browsing the web (for which I'm supposed to use AI mode and AI studio? Very poor UX) Surprisingly, I'm getting better performance for gemini models on 3rd party providers like Perplexity than from the provider itself (it is better at recalling info properly in long chats from my experience in the past two weeks). \n\nLuckily, I had set up spaces/projects on Perplexity and claude earlier, so I'm able to continue my work. Cancelling my Gemini sub until they fix this mess, will be using other services till then. Relieved to see that other users are facing this same issue as well. ",

If I’m looking for fast information to questions or want to learn things, I use Perplexity with Sonar or Gemini Flash 3.  I use Gemini for image generation or if I want summaries of plots of shows or series.

Just look at how bad Manus has gotten, or how often ChatGPT and Gemini users ask if the models got worse. It's not unique to Perplexity - it just gets discussed more loudly here.\n\nThere are things I don't love, like some features being Max-only (the email assistant especially, because it's actually really good).

Maybe if you frequently use the Thinking models is what triggers it?  I don’t think Sonar or Gemini 3 Flash models do though.  I’m also not convinced it’s just not a bug.\n\nThere have been some issues on occasion with model rerouting happening if a model isn’t available for whatever reason, but the model it chooses seems to be fine when that happens. Can always rewrite it in another one.\n\nIf you’re looking to use Perplexity as a chatbot, which isn’t its intended usage, you might run into some issues.  The context window is pretty small and responses are optimized for data retrieval and most of the time limited (but reasonable) output tokens.\n\nFor $20 it’s incredibly worth it.  I’ve considered trying Max but $200 a month is too much.\n\nAs you’ve used perplexity before you would know if it’s the kind of thing you’re looking for.  If it’s not working out for you, try Gemini.  That’s the nice thing about the publicly available AI platforms at the moment, they’re all inexpensive and pretty noncommittal so if something isn’t what you’re after, give something else a try.  I personally wouldn’t consider dropping Perplexity atm, but in fairness also has no intention of dropping Gemini either.  Gemini does have a $10/mo off perk if you’re a Verizon wireless customer, but I’d still get it at full price.  I’d consider dropping ChatGPT but see no real reason to as it’s the first one I ever played around with and was impressed by, and Sora is fun to play around with (even if it’s not all that good compared to some of the things out there).",

To test it, I made the exact same queries on both the free go and paid plus plans. Created the exact same projects in both of these plans. I consistently faced issues in getting hallucinated responses, models not reading my uploaded files properly. \n\nOn the other hand, I get much much better models on the free Gemini plan  (3.0 and nano banana), don't really see any differences in output responses compared to the paid plan (except for a degradation in the deep research quality). I mainly use Gemini 3.0 for coding and generating media. \n\nLikewise for Perplexity pro through Airtel, even though I do have reduced rate limits (which I have seen in multiple subreddits), the quality seems easily better than Chatgpt go's responses for me. But the fact that I get a wide range of models (sonnet, even opus 4.5 for a while) is really worth it. For all web research related purposes, it is my go to now. Their research mode consistently outperforms Gemini's deep research for me (as stated above, this started happening in the last few days only, looks like Gemini is throttling their Deep research, it used to be better before)\n\n",

The underlying model is the same, but Perplexity is optimized for searching and retrieval and has a lengthy set of hidden system instructions that direct it to tell it how it should respond.  (Like if you made a custom Gem in Gemini or something and instructed it to be concise and answer queries directly without trying to hold a conversation.)\n\nIt'll be similar, but won't be the same.",

      "text": "Hi all — I’m the founder and the Executive Director of a smaller non-profit. I wouldn’t say I am a ‘power user’ but I do use AI platforms extensively in a variety of ways. I am trying to rationalize my AI stack and would love real-world feedback from Perplexity Max users (and anyone with experience on Pro or Enterprise Pro).\n\nThe non-profit is focused on child abuse prevention and foster care. My current monthly stack:\n\n•\tChatGPT Plus ($20)\n\n•\tPerplexity Pro ($20)\n\n•\tGemini Pro ($20)\n\nI actively use all three today, but I’m trying to determine what actually needs to stay, what could go, and whether upgrading Perplexity from Pro → Max (or even Enterprise Pro) changes that equation.\n\nI use:\n\n•\tPerplexity heavily for research, fact-checking, and news synthesis for website content.\n\n•\tComet for browser automation for a buildout of Zoho One.  If you aren’t familiar with Zoho One, it’s a pretty complex system of apps for many types of organizations and businesses. Comet helps extensively in these configurations and usage.  I am frequently hitting my limits on the Pro Plan.\n\n•\tChatGPT for policy writing, structured documents, Joomla-ready HTML, and Word templates. When working on our policies, ChatGPT can create nice word documents on our letterhead.  On our website, we have Resource Articles, with accompanying images.\n\n•\tGemini for additional model perspective and some Workspace-related workflows. I am somewhat new to Gemini and am getting a feel for its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nI’m considering upgrading from Perplexity Pro  to Max and want to understand whether that upgrade meaningfully changes which tools I should keep or drop overall — or whether Enterprise Pro is more appropriate for an organization like ours.\n\nQuestions for Perplexity users (Pro, Max, and Enterprise Pro):\n\n1. What do you actually use Max or Enterprise Pro for that Pro couldn’t handle?\n2. How valuable is Labs in real workflows (writing, images, long documents)?\n3. Has upgrading reduced your need for ChatGPT, Gemini, or both?\n4. Anyone using Perplexity (any tier) for:\n\n•\tGrant writing?\n\n•\tPolicy drafting?\n\n•\tWebsite articles with images?\n\n5.\tIf you hit Comet limits on Pro — did Max or Enterprise Pro help at all, particularly with Comet?\n\n6.\tIn hindsight, was the upgrade worth it, or do you see diminishing returns?\n\n7.\tIf you currently pay for multiple AI tools, what did you ultimately keep, drop, or downgrade after upgrading?\n\n8.\tFor a small nonprofit, which Perplexity tier would you recommend and why?\n\nI’m less interested in marketing claims and more in practical, day-to-day value. Appreciate any examples, screenshots, or “I tried it and here’s what stuck” stories.\n\nAny insight you can offer at all is helpful.\n\nThanks!",

It can do magic. I think that will be more fun actually.\n\nI personally see no any reason to upgrade to max. The models are so good already in the pro plan and the only benefit is attaching your email I guess, or am I totally wrong?\n\nI now only use gemini (think I will ditch it), Claude max 100 and perplexity. Before I had grok, mistral (blegh), manus.ai (huge scam, lost 42,- in two days), gemini, gpt and claude.

It’s helpful to me that once I have finished an article to read the way I want, I’ll grab a copy of the markdown that has all of the html tags and cut/paste that into the Joomla article.  I then go in and add images to it and publish it.\n\nI should have added to my initial post about Perplexity’s use of other models.  I’ve read the output isn’t the same in Perplexity vs the original platform but how different is it?  Like, if I run a prompt through Perplexity and have ChatGPT selected, how much of a difference would I see between Perplexity’s output vs had I ran it directly through ChatGPT?",

                  "text": "100% concur with u/guuidx about getting a Claude Pro ASAP and giving it a try. Given the questions you asked in original post I suggest:\n\n  \n1. play with the models button in your chat - know that Grok4 is really good on current events, and the other three front line models (Gemini3, Claude Opus4.5, ChatGPT5.x) each have their own temperaments, but those are muted by the Perplexity \"harness\". I will occasionally have wtf moments with Perplexity, then recall I need to look at the model selector, and it's always Grok4 that triggers this.\n\n2. Once you have the Claude subscription, consider spending another $20 for a month of Nate B. Jones Substack, so you can get into the stuff he offers. You are a prime candidate for Claude \"Skills\", which are scripted ways to package workflows. Nate published ten meta-skills, things that help you get your Skills setup right. This can be used in Claude Desktop AND in Claude Code. He both writes and produces YouTube videos on stuff, he's brilliant (very good) but utterly relentless (you'll be breathless trying to keep up).\n\n3. I am an old guy who likes CLI and I started with Claude Desktop, then Claude Code, but now I'm into Antigravity IDE. Even so, what he says about giving Claude Code a try bears consideration. You didn't say if you're Mac or Windows, it works well on Mac, I'm not Microsoft tolerant so I can't speak to how it behaves there.\n\n5. You did not mention any MCP use. This is the Connectors in Perplexity Desktop. Must use Desktop, this does not yet work in Comet and even if it does it will be very limited. MCP is a way to get your local computer AI usage to also use other stuff on your machine. I use MCP to talk to Postgres/SQLite3 databases, I did a fork of Chroma in order to have a semantic document store for court case/intel work, I'm playing with the Exa search setup. You will be offered a small number of top of the line things, like integration with Google, but be aware that there are literally hundreds of official MCP servers from various tool makers, and thousands of community versions of various things. Take all that you do and ask Perplexity if each of them offer an MCP connector.\n\n  \nAnd at the serious risk of being \\*that guy\\*, I do write about this stuff all the time on my Substack, which is rauhauser dot net.",

I am already on Perplexity Pro but I actually pay for it (don’t get me started on that signup disaster for the 1 year trial). \n\nI’ve been using comet extensively as an agentic assistant. This may not always be the case but I have been using it for building out our Zoho One systems and integrations. The problem is I keep hitting the limits. What I am not clear on is if those same limits exist with Max that I hit in Pro. I don’t want to go from $20 am month to $200 a month just to hit those same limits. And, as someone pointed out, Perplexity doesn’t seem to even publish what the limits are (unless I am missing it somewhere). So, will I see my usage limits go up with the Pro to Max upgrade? \n\nNext is the usage of instructions. Can instructions be set up to change a model depending on the tasks in the process.  So, take my creation of Resource Articles on our website. As an example, let’s say Perplexity is best at creating the content within the article. In my instructions, could I spell that out and as part of this flow, the instructions would say to switch to Gemini to create the images for the article, and then switch to ChatGPT to create the Joomla ready html?  \n\nFor me and what I do, a simple prompt with heavy use of instructions to follow a format is best. Then a very thorough and (fact checking) manual review by me to polish things up. \n\nCan those switches take place as part of a process? Can this be done with labs? I’m not really familiar with labs and just starting to research this part.",

              "text": "I appreciate the response but learning from human feedback is notoriously unwieldy, I'm not going to blindly bias the model, I just want it to act the same every time... not submitting feedback should not corrupt the abilities of the model to perform, it should not have any effect whatsoever. Thumbs up or down is probably the fastest way AI product companies can torpedo their performance. You cannot know ahead of time how the model will learn from that signal. It is better not to touch it at all. You might thumbs up perfectly constructed responses only for the model to learn that the best responses are long or sycophantic. Best case scenario this signal is training a LoRA for my account (that would not be too compute intense or difficult to deploy, multiple opensource backends have LoRA serving) and worst case scenario the model is being dragged down by people who are not carefully checking the quality of the outputs or who have at least to some extent been seduced into LLM psychosis.\n\nMemory is turned off, again I don't want any other requests to bias outputs, I've seen it cause some really stupid behaviors and it generally worsens outputs as the model attempts to shoehorn unrelated memories into the current conversation, I've tried memory on and off multiple times throughout the year just to gauge whether this was consistently a failure mode and my conclusion is yes it most definitely is a frequent source of output degradation.\n\nI'm well aware of the importance in the use of LLMs of packing context, I have built my own coding assistants from scratch by hand (no slop) and I contribute to opensource assistant projects, I have agents in production environments, this isn't my first or even second rodeo using LLMs... I was waiting for statistical language modeling to get to where it is now for more than a decade before OpenAI made GPT3.5 live.\n\nWhat appears to be happening is the model is pretending to refuse to use its search tool but it still cites sources searched (so searches are definitely happening), and the outputs however are sourced heavily if not exclusively from its own internal world knowledge it received during training. Something has to have recently changed about either the system prompt it's receiving or the model used. Either event are infamous for causing instability and unexpected failures.   \n  \nI can only guess that someone pushed changes on a Friday and then went on holiday. \n\nThis has been happening for probably about the last two weeks. There is no good reason it should ever refuse a search, and certainly it should never pretend to refuse a search and then instead of using context retrieved spew nonsensical answers like a drugged-out and hungover GPT-2. \n\nI do not use Spaces, I have confirmed I have memory turned off, and gave it a detailed series of prompts for several turns and this was it output.\n\nIf you're not seeing this problem in your own searches maybe you're just lucky, maybe your searches are in distribution for the model. IDK. I just wish this once very useful thing would begin working again. Gemini 3 Pro is certainly poor refuge from this issue at the moment but I guess it's gonna have to do until someone gets back to the office. \n\nAgainst all odds Gemini 3 Pro one-shotted the answer to the same exact query I copied from my Perplexity request. I can't stress how miraculous that is considering G3Pro has been even more useless at code tasks than Perplexity has been for searches this month.\n\nFingers crossed this gets figured out soon.",

Yes I understand that Perplexity searches the internet in real time to answer my questions.  \nBut it seems like it's gotten to the point where source-based information dump takes precedence over my prompt. Using probability to illustrate, my prompt will contain \"complement of event A\", yet Perplexity will search up and tell me \"event A\" anyway when it's not even relevant, or just 'heat-seek' onto keywords then dump out a paragraph it found on the internet with marginal paraphrasing.  \n  \nIt feels like a glorified search engine with a voice.\n\nMaking a personalised memory or telling it to \"stop shaping your answers entirely on sources\" is useless, as it will quickly return to giving me largely 'copy-paste' answers.  \n  \nI've resorted to free Chatgpt so I can at least have an LLM that actually addresses the logic of my prompt, while using Perplexity to only retrieve facts and information from the internet.  \nBut even in that department, Perplexity will tell me outdated information or get its facts wrong, and even mansplain to me information I strictly told it not to retrieve.  \nOne time it used a source as evidence that I was wrong about something, which happened to be one of the sources that shaped my stance in the first place.",

Comments?\n\n  \n<start>\n\nA key aspect of Trump's strategy: prioritising a potential China confrontation by seeking to neutralise or align Russia, avoiding a two-front great-power rivalry. Trump has explicitly stated intentions to \"un-unite\" Russia from China through deals, viewing Putin as a counterweight to Beijing's influence.\n\n​\n\nTrump's team sees Russia's pivot to China post-Ukraine sanctions as a vulnerability, aiming to lure Moscow back via energy exports, Ukraine concessions, and reduced NATO pressure.\n\n​\n\nThis echoes Nixon's 1970s China play against the USSR, but reversed, with Trump claiming his Putin rapport enables quick wins unavailable to predecessors.\n\n​\n\nPublic statements frame it as pragmatic realism over moral crusades, focusing US resources on Pacific deterrence.\n\n​\n\n\n\nPotential Outcomes\n\n2025 diplomacy includes floated summits and sanction threats, yielding mixed results like brief Ukraine ceasefire talks but no full pivot yet.\n\n​\n\nCritics warn it legitimises aggression, yet supporters argue it averts escalation mirroring pre-WWII alliances.\n\n​<end>\n\n",

          "text": "I’ve found Chatgpt was worst in terms of political bias…\n\nFew months back I had ppxy (best model) to research and made the conclusion:\n\nThis is basically how I see it.\n\nWe’re living in a unipolar world where power is concentrated in the hands of a very small oligarchic class, and most people dramatically underestimate how much of global politics flows from that reality. The US functions as an empire, not in the old colonial sense, but through financial systems, corporate expansion, military force, and proxy states. The rhetoric about democracy and freedom is largely a cover.\n\nSince WWII, US foreign policy has consistently aligned with the interests of large corporations and billionaires, not ordinary people — domestically or abroad. Countries that resist US corporate penetration or try to maintain control over their own resources tend to face sanctions, coups, or direct military intervention. That’s why communist or nationalist governments were targeted so aggressively: they threatened oligarchic control by nationalizing resources or limiting foreign capital.\n\nDomestically, the contradiction is obvious. The richest country on earth has massive poverty, poor healthcare access, high crime, and extreme inequality, while billionaires accumulate obscene wealth and continue to damage the environment for profit. That’s not accidental — it’s the system working as designed.\n\nOn the geopolitical side, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Ukraine, and Iran aren’t isolated events. They line up when you look at dollar dominance, energy control, weakening rivals, and maintaining regional hegemony. Israel functions as a key proxy in the Middle East, with unconditional US support regardless of actions, because it advances US strategic interests in an oil‑rich region. Saudi Arabia is another clear example: zero concern for democracy, total concern for oil and alignment.\n\nThe mainstream media — across “left” and “right” — plays its role by keeping the public focused on surface narratives while ignoring the structural reality: this is about empire, money, and power, not freedom. Most people aren’t taught this history, which is why the same justifications keep working.\n\nAt the end of the day, the US empire is run by a small group of extremely wealthy people who don’t care about American citizens, global citizens, or the planet — only about maintaining dominance and profit. And because it’s the most technologically powerful empire in history, the damage it can still do is enormous.",

I wanted it to browse and create a list but it just did a search all the time.\n\nIn one of the 5 attempts (new threads) I told it „Start the agent now and use the browser“ and it just told me it already does (wrong) and just did a search again. Only at the final attempt after getting angry it actually browsed. Very frustrating \n\nAm I doing something wrong or are you guys experiencing the same?",
