The organization later became CSI (Committee for Skeptical Inquiry) in 2006.​\n\nThe geometric design represents this influential skeptical organization that brought together scientists, magicians, and researchers to counter uncritical acceptance of pseudoscience. The Reddit post you linked suggests the design resembles Perplexity's current asterisk logo, though Perplexity's was independently designed in 2023 by Smith & Diction to represent doorways into knowledge sources",

The image you shared appears to show a panel discussion (likely from decades ago) with a geometric logo on the wall that resembles Perplexity’s current branding, sparking online speculation.\nPerplexity’s Logo Origin\nPerplexity’s logo was designed by Philadelphia-based branding agency Smith & Diction in 2023. According to the designers, the logo intentionally combines several symbolic elements:[ebaqdesign +2]\n•\tComputer cursor – representing digital access and the typing experience\n•\tAsterisk – referencing how Perplexity cites all its sources\n•\tOpen book – symbolizing knowledge\n•\tRevolving doors/windows – representing multiple perspectives and the internet\nThe design team described it as capturing “the idea that whatever you type into Perplexity seamlessly transforms into an answer”.[instagram]\nWhy the Similarity Exists\nGeometric logos built from intersecting lines forming star or asterisk shapes are extremely common in design history—universities, corporations, and organizations have used similar motifs for decades. The building in your photo appears to display such a logo, but this doesn’t indicate copying. Smith & Diction documented their design process publicly, showing how they evolved the concept from a blinking cursor to the final asterisk-inspired icon.[linkedin]\nWhile Perplexity has faced various lawsuits over content (from The New York Times, Encyclopedia Britannica, and Reddit), none involve allegations of logo theft. The visual resemblance to older logos is likely coincidental given how ubiquitous this geometric style has been throughout design history.[nytimes +1]",

I specifically purchased a product from my carrier precisely to get a Perplexity Pro account for a year, and now they are limiting those very accounts for legitimate users, holding them hostage with their credit card data... This completely destroys my trust in Perplexity at this point. Perplexity is a very unpredictable company... Every 3 months they invent something that was not agreed upon anywhere. I have already seen reports that people now have limits on Pro accounts, and receive spam to upgrade when that limit is reached... The very moment I am incorrectly charged for a payment that was not foreseen in my Pro contract, I will leave Perplexity forever. Frankly, I think the Perplexity team should have more respect for its community and its users, whether Perplexity wants to or not... the users are the foundation of its success or its failure. If Perplexity provides no security to its users... it will be the beginning of its end, in my opinion.\n\nPerplexity doesn't give numbers... it doesn't provide clear limits for its users, it gives nothing!! Everything is very cloudy... with no transparency whatsoever...\n\nIt shows a lack of responsibility towards the companies with which they agreed on a plan for a year, and all the clients involved... it seems like amateurish behavior!! They try to attract users, and then take actions that will give them a bad reputation and drive away the very users they had been managing to acquire.... \n\nIt doesn't even make sense...!!",

I also read some were selling them but not sure why that would be. It’s unfortunate that many people got swept up in that but requiring a credit card is not uncommon. They should have done it up front or out better safeguards in place to prevent the abuse. I dont agree with how they did it but I can see why they did.

The one year was activated and now after a few months they are asking for my credit card and it will not automatically stop. \n\nIt's actually worse than some people seem to think. Instead of not charging your card, it now uses a system that charges your card 20$ each month but applies a discount until the yearly voucher code is over. However this means that I'll have to trust them to not charge me before. They have already changed a lot about this payment system and yearly vouchers so what is to say they won't change something again? \n\nWith the overall direction they are going I will probably not pay for it anymore anyway.. The user privacy and data security aspect is not transparant enough for me and the results of deep research are much worse than they were even a year ago. It's a shame really. I would have definitely paid for a service that put end users and people first.\n\nAnd also, not everyone uses a credit card. Some parts of the world barely use it.",

      "text": "I just noticed that **KIMI K2.5** is now available as a model option on Perplexity for Pro and Max subscribers.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen so far, it’s a native multimodal model with a huge context window (up to around 256K tokens) and strong coding plus visual understanding. It’s also open source, which is pretty cool if you care about running or inspecting models outside of closed ecosystems.\n\nIf you’re on Pro or Max, you should be able to select it from the model list and try it on big research threads, code tasks, or anything that mixes images and text. I’m curious how it compares to the other models here in terms of speed and quality, so feel free to share your experiences in the comments.",

If you submit longer text in the prompt, Perplexity will automatically convert the input into a file to handle more content.”​\n\nWith Pro, you also get higher limits for file uploads and advanced modes like Pro Search / Research, which means the effective context you can work with is far beyond 32k, even though a single prompt is limited to 8000 tokens.\n\nSource: Perplexity Help Center About Tokens  \n[https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/10354924-about-tokens](https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/10354924-about-tokens)",

Trillions of dollars in value have already been wiped from US markets because of models like DeepSeek; Nvidia and other tech companies lost billions, and they’re trying to do it again. Anthropic is valued at around 400 billion, and now a Chinese company has released a model that’s as good as Anthropic’s, 7× cheaper, and open source.",

          "text": "Well, according to Perplexity itself:\n\nPerplexity Pro: Critical Issues\n\nQuality Decline & Reduced Search Depth\nMultiple users report significant quality degradation since mid-2024. Previously, Perplexity conducted 10+ web searches per response and provided detailed comparisons. Recently, responses include only 4-6 searches, generic information, and repetitive output even on follow-up questions. One user stated: \"The Perplexity from 3 months ago would leave most people speechless; today's version mostly skips web search completely the first time.\"\n\nHallucination of Sources\nDeep Research has generated completely fabricated citations and numerical data, then maintained false claims when challenged. A lawyer using Deep Research for document analysis received entirely fabricated data and citations to sources that didn't exist. When asked for quotes and citations, it \"complied convincingly\" but the citations were false.\n\nAccuracy Concerns Despite Claims\nPerplexity claims 91.3% search accuracy and 3.5% hallucination rate, but real-world testing reveals problems. On job search research, a user found links didn't lead to listed jobs, descriptions were thin, and hyperlinks were flat-out wrong. By contrast, OpenAI's Deep Research (slower) had 100% accurate links and detailed information. When Deep Research used on specialized topics with weak data coverage, users reported needing to fact-check 30-50% of findings.\n\nDeepSeek R1 Liability\nDeep Research relies on DeepSeek R1, which has a ~14% hallucination rate—significantly higher than Claude (6%) or GPT-4 (8%). This explains the observed fabrication issues.\n\nSubscription & Billing Problems\nUsers report unexpected charges even after cancellation, persistent pop-ups asking to \"upgrade to Pro\" when already subscribed, and inability to upload PDFs (a core Pro feature). Customer service is purely automated email with no human support, making disputes unresolvable.\n\nLimited Feature Customization\nNo plugins, no personalization beyond model selection, and a rigid one-size-fits-all interface. For $20/month, users expected more flexibility.\n\nNo Conversation Memory\nMust re-introduce yourself and context on every query. Platform inconsistency means features appear/disappear without notice.\n\nPoor Data Visualization\nStruggles with charts, summaries, and structured outputs from complex datasets.",

It turns out you can only send 50 Labs messages a month and I blew through mine going back & forth getting requirements ironed out. \n\nAfter researching I contacted support to see if I could get a one time grace extension. I literally hadn’t run anything yet to get results. Their AI Customer Service said no. I pushed again. Still no. Told them this was pushing me toward cancellation and in essence the response was “let us know if you need help canceling”. \n\nI’ve been with them a long time and this was my first time even trying labs but it was to no avail. The overall attitude was clear they weren’t interested in my business, so what makes me think they’ll help me with anything else should I ever need it?",

The forced upsell was a 170 a month from 20, and they expected to get me to do that after giving me no warning. That is a 850% increase in price for the same access... EXCEPT... they don't say how much the new price will buy in terms of usage. Every month I subbed I canceled, I knew they'd do somethign like this. CEO's are human trash. They must be out of their mind to think after ripping someone off of their usage without warning and effectively stealign the months sub that they would be trusted enough to pay 170 on the premise that somehow they won't do it again?

I'm currently a teacher and often deal with lots of idiocy and gaslighting from parents, admin, and students alike. \n\nI find Perplexity the most helpful when I ask questions directly related to district policy on dealing with specific issues. Perplexity will reference district policy and state law in helping me navigate how to best address certain issues. \n\nFor example, I've asked about how often I'm required to contact a parent when a child is failing. My commonsense told me that the parents should be checking the online grade book regularly. However, parents and administrators try to gaslight me into thinking that I need to call the parent daily or weekly when their child is not doing what they’re supposed to do. \n\nAnother situation is when admin told me that I need to provide after school tutoring for failing students. My initial thought was that I should not be required to do that when I’ve done my job during the day. Perplexity helped me to see that I don’t have to do that and showed me the policy, etc. \n\nAnother critical situation is that when I have a wild and disruptive student in class and need them removed so that other students can learn, admin would refuse to remove them and ask whether I’d called the parent just before removal. That’s ridiculous because I’m teaching and all instruction would have to stop so that I could call the parent. Perplexity helped to show me the law and teacher's rights for my state in having a student removed when they are disrupting instruction. Apparently, that disruptive student absolutely must be removed.\n\nI hope that my examples helped you to understand how I'm finding Perplexity useful in my case. But, in law, no. I wouldn't rely on it at all. I've used Westlaw and Lexis in the past and would not rely on Perplexity as an alterative.",

          "text": "Honestly, I’m surprised by this take. In my experience, Gemini’s search implementation is annoying, while Perplexity’s grounding is still miles ahead. Gemini is so loose and lazy, forcing its training knowledge vs checking vs fresh web data. \n\nI actually find Google One AI Premium to be the best offer right now, getting 2TB of storage, $10 Cloud credits, and sharing the AI benefits with 5 family members for $20 is a steal. But if you ask me which one is the superior product right now? It’s clearly Perplexity.\n\nA few reasons why I think it still wins in 2026:\n\n * Model Agnosticism: This is the killer feature. Perplexity isn’t pressured by foundation model development. If a the GPT models turn out to be weak, Perplexity isn't screwed. you just swap models. If the Gemini model is having a bad month, the Gemini app is just … bad. You don't have that single point of failure.\n\n * The \"Whole Product\" Experience: Holistically, the app is just better. The voice input and text-to-speech are far beyond what you get from the standalone Claude or Gemini apps. PPLX Memory is finally on par with ChatGPT, and the limits are way more generous for daily use (even if you \"only\" get Sonnet and not Opus on PPLX Pro).\n\n * Browsers: If you care about full AI browsers, Comet seems like the best option right now, though I’m still cautious about prompt injection so I limit my usage there.\n\nFor me, unless you have a super specific creative roleplay use case, Perplexity is the only one that effectively disappears and lets you actually get work done.",

LLMs are the beginning of the search engine that was always dreamed of...\nI think that, above all, American companies believed they would dominate the market for a long period, due to the processing and energy needs that LLMs (Transformers) require! But LLM technology is becoming exponentially more efficient, and increasingly does not need massive brute-force quantities... so! This takes power away from those American companies; people will not remain dependent on their services... in a few years... I dare say... 2 to 5 years... you will already be able to run a good LLM on your desktop, without needing to depend on a company that offers cloud services... and this must be the path forward... even if American companies don't like the idea!!\n\n\n\nIf Perplexity makes sense in 2026, yes, it does, and very much so! However, it is not with these kinds of limitations that Pro users will be able to survive. Yet... it will only be a matter of time before more companies start doing what Perplexity does...",

Follow my orders—we're not stopping until it's found, by the way.\"\n\nIt said : NOPE, I'm closing .......

I’m trying to build a repeatable workflow that does not turn into hallucinated numbers or cherry-picked sources.\n\nIf you use it regularly, what does your process look like end to end? Like: tickers you follow, what you ask first, how you verify, what you save, and what you never use it for.\n\nAlso curious what people do for earnings weeks, macro news days, and basic portfolio check-ins. Do you keep it inside Perplexity, export to a doc, or just use it as a starting point?\n\n",

When you ask \"\"what was Q3 revenue?\"\" it generates a plausible-sounding number based on context, not necessarily the actual figure.  \nWhat works:  \n  \nQualitative research (management commentary, strategic direction)  \nGetting oriented on a new sector/company  \nAutomated alerts via Perplexity Tasks for news monitoring  \n  \nWhat absolutely doesn't work:  \n  \nBuilding backtests (data integrity issues)  \nMulti-period analysis  \nAnything requiring 99%+ accuracy  \nRegulatory/compliance work  \n  \nMy current workflow:  \n  \nUse Perplexity for initial research and thesis development  \nUse specialized tools (Koyfin, Bloomberg, FactSet) for actual data extraction  \nBuild everything myself in Python/Excel with verified sources  \nUse Perplexity again to check if I missed any news/context  \n  \nThe Tasks feature is actually solid for automating weekly sector summaries, but I only use it for directional info, never for decisions.  \nIf anyone wants a better alternative for earnings extraction, look at tools specifically built for this like Fintool or even just learn to parse EDGAR XML yourself.

I’ve been using it for a few months now and generally like the service. However, I just received an incredibly pushy email from Perplexity stating that if I don’t enter my billing details immediately, my Pro subscription will be terminated.\n\nWell, they weren't kidding. They’ve already \"paused\" my Pro features until I hand over my payment info.\n\nThe obvious goal here is to force me into an auto-renewal so they can start charging me the second the promo ends. Look, don't get me wrong, I’m not some \"freeloader\" looking for a handout. I spend over €100/month on various AI subscriptions and API credits for my workflow. I have no problem paying for value.\n\nBut this feels so cheap. If you partner with a reputable company to distribute vouchers, don't make it the customer's problem. It’s like they’re handing out these promos like candy to pump their user numbers, but then treating those same users with zero trust.\n\nMy code is 100% legit from a Tier-1 provider, yet I'm being held hostage for my CC details halfway through the agreed term. It’s just a \"low-rent\" move for a company trying to compete with the big players.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? Did you cave and give the info?",

I switched to Claude for daily use and the difference is night and day, and I was in your exact situation with Perplexity.\n\nWith Claude, the chat just keeps building. If it gets long, it makes room and keeps going instead of forcing you to start over and retrain everything from scratch. The memory system actually works across separate conversations. I can close a chat, come back days later in a completely new thread, and Claude already knows my context, my projects, my preferences, all of it. No retraining needed. Important note though: if you delete a chat, Claude won’t remember that conversation unless you specifically told it to remember something from it.\n\nI’m not coding with it, just daily life stuff. Research, planning, working through problems, general questions. The only time I hit a rate limit is if I’m really going hard with a ton of questions back-to-back for like 4 hours straight, then I might wait like 20 minutes. But that’s rare and honestly fair for how much I’m using it.\n\nClaude’s also way more conversational than Perplexity. It actually feels like talking to someone instead of just getting search results thrown at you. You can work through ideas, ask follow ups naturally, and it adapts to how you communicate.\n\nCompare that to Perplexity where you’re constantly hitting that “start a new thread” wall and wasting hours re-explaining everything. Plus Claude isn’t spamming you with popups begging you to upgrade when you’re already paying for Pro. The respect for paid users is actually there.\n\nThe memory feature isn’t perfect. Sometimes you need to remind it on really specific technical details. But it’s genuinely functional and saves massive amounts of time. You can even tell Claude “remember this” or “forget that” and it actually listens.\n\nIf that single memory issue is killing your productivity with Perplexity, Claude’s worth trying. The Pro subscription actually feels worth it here.\n\nHonestly, Perplexity’s garbage support ended up doing me a favor. Forced my hand to switch and I’m glad it did. Best productivity move I’ve made in a while.",

      "text": "I don't understand why so many people are complaining about Perplexity; it's almost like they're being paid to do it, lol. Some say they're limiting the use of \"PRO Search\" and \"Deep Research\" queries, but that's not happening to me. It constantly \"returns\" PRO Search queries to me; sometimes I've used two or three PRO queries and I check the count and it says \"597 queries remaining,\" then a few minutes or hours later I check again and it says \"600 queries remaining.\" They say it's giving wrong information, but it's the only one that never gives wrong information to me. I've caught wrong information in all the other AIs, but I've never noticed anything wrong with Perplexity. I've also never seen it hallucinate. Today, for example, I uploaded a video to Gemini and Perplexity where someone was teaching me how to use a computer program, and I asked them to create a detailed tutorial connecting what the person said with where they clicked. Gemini failed on the first attempt and refused to do it on the second, claiming some problem with the video transcription, while Perplexity did it on the first try, it didn't even take two minutes and delivered more than I asked for, it delivered a detailed tutorial and more additional information that wasn't in the video, a summary of commands and points of attention. I always make these requests to more than one AI, and even when the others succeed, Perplexity constantly delivers something better.\n\nThey also often speak ill of Comet, and well, it really is still far from perfect, it makes a lot of mistakes and theoretically it's not very secure, but it's ahead of all the other agentic browsers that exist today, and the Android version does what it can with the limitations of the OS. In short, I think that what differentiates AIs is not their language models but how they work, and for me it is clear that the fact that Perplexity first searches the internet and only then uses its training is an advantage in almost all uses, at least in mine. I'm using the free 1-year PRO plan I got in October or November, and I'm 100% sure I'll subscribe to Perplexity when that free period ends. For me, it's the best AI, directly rivaling Gemini, which has more features but is quite mind-boggling.",

The limits that are being implemented are new and even Perplexity’s site mentions weekly limits similar to what old daily limits used to be.  I personally haven’t hit the limits either, and I feel like I use it all the time.  I do most of the time use Sonar or Gemini Flash though, so maybe it does weight them differently.\n\nAs for being inaccurate, I find it no worse than any other AI platform out there, and most of the time very good.  I personally don’t like Comet but not because of anything in particular, I just don’t need a browser to do that.\n\nThat’s the good thing about options nowadays, there’s so many of them out there, if something doesn’t do what we need it to, can switch to something else.  I currently have a Perplexity Pro, Gemini Pro, and ChatGPT Plus sub and like each in their own way.  (Though the first two are what I use most of the time.)\n\nI will say, at least two people that I’ve commented on in regards to Pro limitations have later DM’d me asking to buy an Enterprise Max code from them, which definitely makes me think there is some kind hustle going on in this subreddit.",

If you give a free trial, don't take it back at a random moment, and don't change the conditions drastically. One day, you have your Pro plan; the next, you don't, period. Or one day, it suddenly asks for a credit card. Those changes naturally create trust issues; companies rarely make such changes these days, and users are used to different treatment.  \n  \n2. Hidden limits and unannounced limit decreases. Same as the previous one, it makes trust issues but for the paid users as well. People are used to having proper announcements in advance about changes like that. With Perplexity, we don't even have any kind of announcement.\n\n3. The picture generation issue. One interface for everything was a huge feature, but again, suddenly there are no pictures anymore for many users. And zero communication about it. Image generation isn't available in my country, okay, where is the list of countries, at least? Naturally, people aren't pleased about that. As much as I hate CharacterAI's recent changes regarding underage users, they at least put some effort into explaining the changes, making regular announcements in advance, gradually decreasing service availability, and providing some solutions and resources. And those were mostly their unpaid users. Perplexity? They seem to care not.\n\n4. The way the engine explains limitations. It doesn't say, \"this feature is only supported for Pro users\"; it says, \"I can't do this.\" They said there is an issue with that image generation, but the model keeps replying the issue is the country. Feels worse than useless.\n\nTo the other, product issues:\n\n1. The search. Recently, I have been receiving better search results in Google because they read into my intention better. In Perplexity, I get irrelevant answers with no reference to other possible implications of my request. Google shows those implications and gives more relevant results based on recent search trends.\n\n2. Comet feels less stable against some other browsers, for example, in the case of the chain of redirects.",

I’m talking about many hours, days and weeks of real use. And I can tell you: GPT’s web search is excellent. It’s genuinely impressive.\n\nFor comparison, I’ve also used Gemini 3 Pro, and when it comes to web research, Gemini 3 Pro can’t even come close to GPT-5.1 or GPT-5.2 Thinking with web browsing.\n\nSo what about Perplexity especially for more complex questions? For example, legal research where you need to find specific statutes, sections and subsections, and where you have to connect multiple provisions and interpret how they relate to each other. How does Perplexity compare in that kind of scenario?\n\nI don’t want to pay for a Perplexity Pro subscription if I’m already getting fantastic web searching with GPT. But if Perplexity is truly better significantly better then it could be worth it for me.\n\n",

It's really useful because it investigates a lot, it's very powerful, it can reach +120 sources and in some of my cases +150, and Chathtp deep research is difficult at 50, but Perplexity's reasoning is much inferior to chatgptand\nChatGPT: the best in reasoning, thinking tasks more than searching, proposing, filtering, and it's basically the smartest.\nGemini: I know less about this one, but from what I tested, it also searches many Google sources.

It tends to over-collect information without processing it effectively; it once generated a research report for me that was nearly 30,000 words long, making it almost unreadable.\n\nFor me, Perplexity excels at fact-checking, so I use it as a supplement to ChatGPT or Gemini when I am skeptical of their outputs. Gemini, in particular, is problematic because it doesn't clearly indicate whether it has executed a web search. Starting with the 3 Flash model, it has even been deceptive—claiming to have searched while providing fabricated links. This persists even with the official API marked with the web-search suffix, which is quite concerning. ChatGPT, on the other hand, remains excellent in reasoning and helps me effectively organize my thoughts.",

To answer your query, it defaults to crawling the live web first. It then parses that data into a response.  \n\nStandard LLMs like ChatGPT or Claude prioritize their internal, pre-trained datasets. While they have added search tools, the web retrieval is an add-on feature rather than the core architecture. As for multi-ai wrappers, they are nice to use when they have a decent ui (f.e. writingmate) or when used locally and you build it for yourself",

          "text": "Perplexity is an ai search engine with chatbot capabilities. That’s the simplest way I can put it. From its inception it was a search engine and it still is. It’s search oriented, in that it uses the web for every answer and every query. So it’s search engine first and chatbot second. Think of it like an answer engine. \n\nIt uses RAG to scan the web or your uploaded files for certain keywords and portions of the website, blog, uploaded files etc to give you the answer you need. In simpler terms think of RAG like this: you ask it to give you info on benefits of Vitamin C for men. It will scan dozens of websites and find the areas of those websites that talk about vitamin c benefits and it synthesizes that info and presents it in a clear and coherent answer. But it does all this pretty fast. \n\nIt’s a much better alternative to google search cuz it gives you the answer, backed by citations/references so the answer is relatively accurate. \n\n\nIt’s not an LLM itself but uses other LLMs. But here is the very important distinction. When you use Perplexity you don’t have access to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok etc…or their models really. \n\nYou have access to a limited and fine tuned version of those models within the limits and bounds of perplexity. Perplexity uses those models for search and deep research and for all queries you give it. The models are system prompted by perplexity to act a certain way. \n\nIn other words perplexity uses Gemini 3 pro for your question or prompt but you don’t really use the same Gemini 3 pro available in Gemini. A simple comparison is their context windows. All models in perplexity are limited to 32k context tokens. Whereas GPT5.2 thinking is 196k tokens in ChatGPT and Gemini 3 is 1M context tokens in Gemini. \n\nContext tokens and window are the amount of data, information, characters, words, pages etc that the model can accurate access, read, synthesize, analyze and understand. Think of it like the models horsepower. The more the better. Gemini 3 pro in Gemini can read and understand up to 1500 pages or 500,000 words. \n\nAlso the reasoning and logic of the version of the models used in perplexity is much lower compared for the actual model in its own chatbot. This is all about computing power and costs. If perplexity gave you access to 100% version of Gemini 3 pro then they’d go broke and no one would use ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude or Grok. But clearly there is a reason why people use this chatbots. \n\nFor heavier work such as coding, long forms of writing, editing, summarizing large files, analyses, etc…those other chatbots are much better. \n\nFor quick fact checking, everyday Google searches, updates, quick facts and news, prices, the hours your local gym is open, etc…perplexity is better. \n\nGemini and ChatGPT have improved their web search and deep research massively and they’re even better than perplexity at it due to their reasoning and analysis and their larger context windows and better long memory. But for quick searches they’re slower. \n\nTry it yourself: give the same exact prompt to perplexity using Gemini 3 pro or GPT5.2 thinking with deep research on perplexity and do the same thing in Gemini and ChatGPT respectively and you will see the latter will give you longer, more thorough, expensive and better reasoned answers. \n\nPerplexity is a good tool for simple searches you’d use google search for. The other chatbots are feature packed and better for all other tasks. \n\n\nHere’s my take on what each major chatbot really is great at: \n\nPerplexity = the Google search replacement. Fast and accurate searches and answers. \n\nChatGPT = the jack of all trades and the Apple of the AI world. They’re the most popular and have all the features and they’re good at everything but not great at any one thing. Although ChatGPT has the best long memory feature by far. Great image and video generation models. Best deep research out of all chatbots(most thorough, accurate and best reasoning) \n\nGemini = the context powerhouse and best at reading, understanding, analyzing large files and documents. And the best reasoning model by far. Geminis 1M context window makes it the best for uploading PDFs, doc, docx files etc…and writing longer reports. Also being deeply integrated into the Google ecosystem with docs, slides, calendar, maps…it’s the fastest growing one and second only to ChatGPT but it will surpass them. Best image and video generation models as well. Great at deep research with nice visuals. Using Google indexing it has the best access to sources from the web. \n\nClaude = best for coding and creative writing. Also best for Microsoft ecosystem with its seamless integration with Microsoft apps like creating excel files, word documents etc..Bad for deep research and virtually no photo and video generation features. \n\nGrok = great reasoning model and best for unfiltered AI with their many personalities. Great option if you’re a heavy X user. Has great image generation models too. Not ideal for deep research.",

Gemini freaked out the first time and refused the second time, claiming that something was missing from the video transcript. Perplexity created the tutorial on the first try, and not only did it create it, but it did it better than I asked. It delivered a tutorial with detailed step-by-step instructions (which I requested) and additional information that wasn't in the video, a summary of the main commands, and points to pay attention to!\n\n\nI believe that the differentiating factor of AIs lies not in the language model they use, but in the way they work, and for me it is very clear that the fact that Perplexity searches the internet first and only then uses training learning is essential for it to better understand what we ask it to do and even the searches we perform.",
