      "text": "Dear Perplexity team,\n\nI cancelled my subscription today. Lucky for me, it expires in April, but honestly, I was ready to renew without a second thought until recently. The way I see it, you have six weeks to show me you actually care about paying customers. The clock is ticking.\n\nFor the past ten months, I've been one of your biggest advocates. I recommended Perplexity to colleagues, friends, and anyone who'd listen. At $210/year it was worth every penny to me—a tool that genuinely improved my productivity and fit perfectly into my workflow.\n\nI haven't mentioned it once since the limits started dropping.\n\nAt first, I wasn't too worried about the changes. Then they kept piling on—until the limits dropped faster than Donnie's tariff threats on a Tuesday. When I learned about all the free subscriptions you handed out like candy, it suddenly made sense why you needed to reign in costs. But understanding *why* doesn't make it suck any less for those of us who actually paid real money.\n\nThis week I finally hit the wall where your new limits are actively hurting my productivity. I'm not just disappointed—I'm pissed. I'm pissed because paying customers like me are absorbing the consequences of decisions we didn't make. You promised free candy for a year without checking if you had enough candy, or money to buy candy, and now we're paying the price.\n\n**Here's what you're missing:** You're alienating the exact segment you need most—users willing to pay cold, hard dollars. If you lost most of your free subscribers tomorrow, it'd probably be a godsend to your infrastructure and bottom line. But paying users who cancel or initiate chargebacks? Those people don't come back. You're hemorrhaging the revenue and advocacy that actually matters.\n\nI'm a patient person. I want Perplexity to succeed because you've built something genuinely valuable. But my patience ran out today, and I'm guessing I'm not alone. You're dealing with refund requests and chargeback disputes from people who actually paid money—that's not stopping the bleeding, that's accelerating it.\n\n**Here's how you fix this and win back paying customers:**\n\nCreate a **Pro+ tier at $18/month** with meaningful limits—not the 200 daily Pro searches you had before, but something substantial like 20+ weekly research queries, more file uploads, and the features that made this indispensable.\n\nLet **paying subscribers upgrade by crediting what we've already paid**—we'd only pay the $1/month difference for our remaining subscription time. Got a free promo subscription? No credit for you. Pay full price to upgrade.\n\nThis solves three problems at once:\n\n1. It rewards the people who supported you when it mattered\n2. It creates a new revenue stream from users who actually need higher limits\n3. It stops punishing your paying base to clean up a free-subscription hangover you created\n\nYou have until April to change my mind. Show me you value the people who believed in you enough to pay. Otherwise, I'm gone, and I won't be recommending you to anyone ever again.\n\nYou've built something valuable. Don't torpedo it by punishing the people who believed in it enough to pay.\n\nA (formerly enthusiastic) paying customer",

In Claude they list their models with a separate option for  Extended Thinking. Perplexity seems to have gotten rid of the toggle and grouped them together so it’s easier to intentionally choose the one you want– with fewer places to go to piece together models and modes.",

So, someone posted unwanted codes for sale at a fraction of the usual annual subscription price. How did the codes end up on the grey market? Were they 'leaked' directly by partner organisations? Or by individuals who received the codes but did not want them and are trying to make a quick buck?\n\nThere are other cases of similar grey-market practices where such behaviour remains unpunished. For example, reselling bulk corporate Windows activation keys to individual consumers seems to be tolerated by Microsoft, even though, as far as I know, it technically breaches their terms of service. A slightly different situation, I understand, but presumably Perplexity allocated these codes to their partners with the expectation that **some** would not be used; otherwise, it wouldn't be feasible. Is that the issue? More uptake than expected?\n\nPerhaps Perplexity should have designed its promotions to make it harder for people to sell codes on the grey market. 🤷‍♂️\n\nI wouldn't personally take such a risk, but this entire situation appears, at least at first glance, to be a PR mistake that, in hindsight, could have been handled better (if not avoided altogether).",

By that time, the market may change significantly, given how established models are also trying to ration the use. \n\nThey have attracted a large number of free users each year. As most of the freebies were last fall, they will expire this fall.   \nSo, if the company's purpose is to capitalise on users (and not attract investors' money again), they basically need to start being very attractive in September.   \nFor now it looks like they intend to treat Pro as a demo version of Max.  \nI'd expect them to gradually introduce new features, incorporating elements from other models, etc., and limiting them to Max, or leaving only a few for Pro.   \nCloser to September, once the hardware market stabilises and several other model aggregators change their models to stay afloat (or further move to token-based transactions), they will increase usage for Pro users (and aggressively communicate that) to keep those Trial users.   \n  \nThat said, they have turned their back on early adopters (like me), who were promoting it, and who are paid users, as for the moment, the value is significantly lower compared to the competition.   \n  \n",

But then my bank offered a one-year free plan for Perplexity.  Seemed like a no-brainer to get a free premium LLM so went with that.  I do find myself going back to Chat every now and then as it just seems smarter in general (maybe more in terms what understanding what I'm trying to get at) when given them the same prompts.  Recently with all the Claude/Clawbot news + Excel Integration, I gave that a try and ended up signing up pro for $30/month with Anthropic even though I have a free year on Perplexity.

And Pro tier is getting closer and closer to being the free tier lol. And don’t get me started on Perplexity Comet. For free users, they stated that the features would be free, then they made the agentic model worse, so it went from doing quizzes and doing stuff easily to failing most of them. And then they just removed the agentic features for free users, so now it’s just a browser that uses tons of performance and does nothing better than Chrome.",

Is the answer located somewhere on the Internet, you just don’t want to have to take a bunch of time to go find it?  Perplexity is the best.  I deal with the deep research by running Claude sonnet 4.6.  It’s the best imo.  I also subscribe to Claude for things that operated in a closed loop universe like with work because even using their models on perplexity it gets distorted and breaks down the text or data into little fragments and may end up missing context where you don’t want it to.  That’s not how Claude works when you just use their models on their own application.  \n\nThey have annoyed me, sure, not enough for me to stop using it in favor of the web feature on chat gpt or something because everyone else’s answer engine with internet supplemented RAG is absolute garbage.",

It's probably the most similar I've had to PPLX. If you download Brave Nightly you can use it completely free as much as u want and select different models. I personally have liked using Deepseek on there. \n\nHuggingface.co has plenty of free options as well. You can even set up transformers for free. I'm yet to do that, but I hear it's very reaourceful. \n\nGrok. Is free and not half bad. With no limits. \n\nBlackbox.ai has a 90 day free trial\n\nDuck.ai is also decent and free\n\nIf you're somewhat tech savvy, you can go on GitHub and spin up Perplexica. Which is an open sourced free alternative as closely resembling perplexity as anything else out there. \n\nYou.com\n\n\nI could go on and on.....try some of these. You gotta use a lil effort and time to knowledgeabley save your PPLX limits. \n\nAnyone with any other suggestions or anything feel Free to add. Point is we have options....PLENTY!!!",

              "text": "Here's the cherry on top. Drum roll please... You thought you had access to different models, but you had access to them in a limited, confined, and system-prompted version within the confines of Perplexity search and Deep Research. So Gemini 3 Pro or GPT 5.2 thinking cloud sonnet, or even now Cloud Opus 4.6 in Perplexit, is not exactly what it is in their own respective chatbots or when using them with their own API. They're all limited to a 32K context window. You can literally test this by giving them the same prompts for a Deep Research or Web Search, checking the Gemini 3 Pro check, and using Gemini 3 Pro in Perplexity. Does the same thing with GPT 5.2, thinking this was always a misleading thing, Perplexity ever since they included all these different models. The amount of logic, reasoning, analysis, and \"intelligence\" that those models have within their own chatbots or when used with your API key is not the same as what Perplexity offers.   \n  \nPerplexity does nothing better than Gemini besides a faster Web Search and Deep Research. The same goes for ChatGPT. ChatGPT offers the best chatbot experience; it's the jack-of-all-trades. To be honest, it's good at everything, but it's not great at any one thing besides its long memory feature. Their Deep Research is quite amazing, though. It's the most thorough, extensive, and detailed, and it uses actual reasoning; it actually analyzes and synthesizes the information. It's not just feeding you information; it's guiding you through it, and it has actually synthesized and understood your prompt. You could tell it has understood what you are doing because it is very thorough and detailed, and it has used reasoning.   \n  \nGemini's Deep Research is also amazing, thanks to Google's indexing. I mean, think about it. He wrote the game on the search engine that they have the most access to sources, so Gemini's Deep Research is also visually appealing. It uses headings and subheadings, and you can easily export them to Google Docs. Keeping the same formatting is just more convenient that way, and they use visuals as well. With Gemini AI Pro, which is the same price as Perplexity Pro, you get 20 Deep Research reports per day, and you get 100 Gemini 3 Pro queries per day. You get NotebookLM Pro, 2 terabytes of Google Drive storage, the ability to create up to 1000 images with Nano Banana, and access to Whisk and Flow. You get Gemini in virtually all Google work apps. You might think this is not a big deal, but summarizing an hour-long podcast is a great deal, to be honest. Or easily transcribing a YouTube video that doesn't have a transcription available. And don't even let me get started on NotebookLM. Noble Galam alone has more features than Perplexity offers as a whole, and it also gives you a 1-million-context window. While there are some arguments that they don't actually go up to 1 million context, at least they can read 30+ page PDFs accurately, have the best OCR capability for PDFs, and, because of their large context window, are the best for uploading files. They have so many features, honestly, Google is winning this AI race like there's no competition. They can afford to lose billions with Gemini; they simply don't care. Gemini is a side project of theirs.   \n  \nGoogle's main \"service\" is ads, and their main product is \"data\"; that's how they make revenue; that's it. And they don't just make an AI chatbot; the entire goal is not just AI. They make software, hardware, apps, and they have the world's largest search engine. They have access to more data than all of the tech companies combined. They have much more resources, funding, investors, engineers, etc. than Propexity. Even OpenAI can't keep up with them anymore, and they're taking ChatGPT users and market share day by day. , let alone Perplexity. That's why they're offering generous usage limits and adding so many updates and features literally every six weeks.   \n  \nNotebookLM alone underwent more improvements in six months than Perplexity did in two years. I'm just frustrated because I loved Perplexity, and I really wanted them to do well. I used it at my university for my business and personal searches; it was the best for AI web search, deep research, and web scanning. It replaced Google search for me, but now, with this, it honestly has no utility anymore. ",

They also tried to imitate ChatGPT and Gemini by including all these different features, none of which are nearly as good as ChatGPT or Gemini. Like their memory feature, for instance, which was a disaster. To this day, it feels like it's in beta mode.   \n  \nEspecially now that we only get 25 deep research queries per month, if ChatGPT Plus is offering 25 per month, well, at least they have the best chatbot, the most app connectors, the best memory feature, and great reasoning models like GPT 5.2 thinking. They give you 3000 queries per week, it's that, not that they're not even in the same league. Perplexity is only a niche, and the only advantage was the accurate, fast web search, deep research, and filtering sources on the academic social web, etc. Still, both Gemini and ChatGPT have improved their deep research exponentially.   \n  \nThe pro search isn't really a \"pro\" feature this is regular web search i mean chat gpt web search does the same thing as Perplexity's pro search to be honest but Perplexity's deep research was what mattered people use it for even small searches because it was thorough accurate provided citations so much information and so much sources in a clear format clear refined format i could have done a deep research on any topic with Perplexity and learn it or truly become up to date on a new product on it or troubleshooting something a software issue whatever it may be and it's not the fact that their deep research queries are limited to 25 per month right now it's the fact that they lied to us they should have gave people a warning in advance and cutting it by more than 95 percent   \n  \nokay instead of giving us 600 per day maybe they should have given us at least 50 per day or even 20 per day instead of 25 per month I was I will stay out with Perplexity tell eternity if they honestly gave me 20 deep research queries per day or even 10 per day let's go even lower that's still 300 per month way more than ChatGPT Plus and even more than chat GPT Pro but no they cut it so much because of their mismanagement because they're running out of money they were looking for an exit   \n  \nthey thought Apple is gonna buy them or another big tech companies gonna buy them why do I think they were looking for exit because they try to increase their user base exponentially by giving away free promotions left and right their growth wasn't natural or organic it was forced, while Chatgpt, Grok, Gemini and Claude were natural and organic people pay for the service they find value in it naturally it grows these chat bots are only as valuable as several paid users they have. Still, Perplexity tries to force their growth by giving away free promotions left and right, with usage limits that are more than generous, to lure customers in, and all of a sudden cut it down by more than 95%. See if tomorrow Gemini AI Pro cuts down their deep research to 10 per day, people will still stay because it offers so much more. It's not entirely revolved around deep research. But PerpPerplexity's niche, advantage, and great feature were its deep research. That's the difference. \n\nIt's really ironic and funny that people keep saying Google is greedy and it's a monopoly. Listen, I don't disagree, they are a monopoly, but at least they're not misleading their customers, and they're giving away very generous usage limits. I'm a university student, and I have been subscribed to Perplexity for more than a year and a half now. But when they introduced Education Pro, I subscribed. It was $5/month, but then they raised it to $9.99 without any updates, notifications, or news. All of a sudden, I saw it's $9.99.\n\nOn the other hand, Gemini is offering 12 months free for Gemini AI Pro for all university students. I saw so many people within this subreddit attacking Google and saying, \"Oh, Google is going down.\" Perplexity offered to buy Chrom,e which was honestly a very stupid and funny thing because they could never even afford it. But everyone was siding with Perplexity against Google. Yeah, fight the power, fight the big monopoly Google. But now look who's over the smaller company. ",

But still it is bad practice to put such pressure on anyone who got a paid version, irrespectively of whether he paid, since it is dumb to do that if one got it for free. Customer retention on a software product highly depends on emotional attachment and dispelling frustrations in which the customer has no fault but his natural earnings power and budget. I expect a company I am allied with to have tact and a sense of proportion. But perhaps too much expected for a product from the Bay tech scene or work culture …",

Perplexity wanted this niche but that window has closed if you can’t do volume Deep research anymore. In the overall search market Google has 90%+.\n- Claude has found a niche in vibe coding and is quickly moving away from being considered  just another LLM and being a service you make apps you dream off. \n\nThere might be space for research that Perplexity is building out but the question is if the value the service provides with its service is “good enough”. There might be enough space in the market for two or three other major players but a lot of the other niche services will either fail or get rolled up. \n\n It should have be a warning when Apple who is failing in the AI space considered purchasing Perplexity look at the books and values and said no. \n\nhttps://medium.com/utopian/perplexity-was-the-google-killer-then-apple-changed-everything-a1fea6a53461",

I think for services like OpenAI, Sam Altman thought scaling was going to reach AGI. Too many people in the technocracy think that humans are replaceable . While I think that the fact that we have inspiration as a species makes us irreplaceable when doing most tasks that humans or the market find valuable. Will LLMs replace some positions? Yes, but that is because they are not organic jobs and are structured. There is a reason why in The Jetsons, the robots did everything but George’s job, was to press a button to make a Spacey Sprocket. It was a commentary on us finding ourselves doing everything but the job we are paid for, educated, or trained on. Even though it didn’t exist, we write emails; they wrote memos. We have meetings and file out paperwork and other tedious tasks.\n\nThe LLM services that are going to survive find their niche, show value to the market, and dominate it. Dario Amodei and the rest of the Anthropic team left because they didn’t believe that scaling LLMs would lead to AGI. Altman and his team do, so we have two different visions. I truly believe that AGI is impossible; the human “soul” is not replaceable. Everything humans have invented is a problem in society that needed a solution, and the inspiration, motivation, and technology met at the same time. Even LLMs meet this criterion. In the developed world, we aren’t having enough children that can produce more, so how are we going to eventually keep or increase our productivity and sustain our society? We develop tools that will allow the market to allocate resources to greater value-producing jobs. It wasn’t productive to have thousands of women patching us into different phones, so we automated the operator. \n\nI’m technical, but I can’t code for my life. I’m able to build out a physical office, lay the low power lines, patch them, and then configure the infrastructure and support it, that my skill set allows. There are apps or services I’ve imagined but can’t make myself. AGI will never exist because to have a general intelligence, you need to exist in the world. If the smartest people with trillions spent and almost all the information that humans have made in our 12,000 years of civilization can’t give LLMs nuance to understand the world we exist in text, then it will not reach AGI.",

Even OpenAI regularly tells their customers when they are changing pricing and features while Perplexity just doesn't give a sh#t. They will eventually be bought out by a bigger company, or they will fire their current team members when they loose enough customers and hire a more customer friendly bunch. Transparency in pricing and letting customers know what's changing is the hallmark of a successful service company which the current version of Perplexity isn't. ",

It’s just laziness and UI theatrics these companies are using.

Glad to hear input and anybody who can help accelerate the build and willing to split profits once it’s there. DM me if interested in getting involved - I’ve got a large part of the code written, but I’m relying on strict verifications and working with the same AIs who could care less about quality not matter how convincing they sound - so a knowledgeable human in the loop who understands the parts I have to learn thru experience would be a massive help.

Where are legitimate users porting to for the same price point and not hitting the limits.",

So, has someone posted unwanted codes for sale at a fraction of the usual price of a yearly subscription? How have the codes ended up on the grey market? By partner companies or individuals who received the codes but don't want them, and are trying to make a quick buck?\n\nThere are other instances of this kind of grey-market loophole where such behaviour remains unpunished. Reselling bulk corporate Windows activation keys to individual consumers, for example, seems to be tolerated by Microsoft, even though it technically breaches their terms of service. Slightly different situation, I understand, but presumably Perplexity allocated these codes to their partners with the expectation that some wouldn't be used, thus making the promotions viable? Is that what the issue is? More uptake than expected?\n\nPerhaps Perplexity should have designed its promotions so that it wouldn't be so easy for people to sell codes on the grey market.\n\nI wouldn't personally take such a risk, but this entire situation appears to be a PR blunder.",

So had it been a more reasonable 50-100 per month cap for “Pro” accounts with a throttle down to around their current 20 for the abusers at most… I highly doubt the public reaction would have had nearly as much whiplash.\n\nThe fact that they overestimated their own capabilities to deal with problems like this and the “goodness” of people shouldn’t be a consequence that suddenly falls on every user that plays within their rules and isn’t actively seeking or selling loopholes & exploits. But I suppose that’s just my take. 🤷‍♂️",

Anyone who says otherwise is wrong. Aside from collecting and selling your data what use does an AI browser have on mobile?

              "text": "They ran these promotions for several reasons. The main ones I can think of are to rapidly grow their user base and to show exponential growth to investors. The second part of that tactic is to hope that when you give people one free year, they will forget about it and then renew at the end of the year for the entire next year. What they don’t consider is that this will result in a giant pile of chargebacks that won't look good for them in the long run.\n\nAlso, if they actually decided to be acquired, that exponential growth would not have been so impactful. My assumption is they were looking to be acquired, but when everyone started examining their books, seeing their growth potential against that of Google and OpenAI, and anything else they may have noticed, they did not bite.\n\nNow they’re pivoting to enterprise customers because they’re in sustainability mode, just like You.com was half a year ago or more. They’re also cutting back on usage limits because now they have to feed a bunch of non-paying Pro customers for X number of months, depending on when you signed up. Admittedly, I’m one of those free users, but I had been a paying customer for over half a year before I was eligible for one of the promotions. I had no issue paying for the service because it was good, but I would never return to being a paying customer with the recent changes.\n\nI watched another YouTube video that talked about why they’re going to lose to Google in this. One of the main things this person pointed out was that every time Perplexity does a search, it costs them quite a bit of money, whereas when Google does a search, they’ve got that process refined down to where it costs them little to nothing. All they have to do is feed that context into their model and instruct the model on how to do citations, and now they have taken the main strength of what Perplexity brought to the market that no one else was doing a few years ago. Now everyone does it.",

The complete lack of transparency and basic respect for users is the real issue here.\n\nPerplexity appears to be suspending active subscriptions (including promo-based ones from ISP bundles or paypal) without prior notice. When you contact support, you get an AI bot that:\n\n* Refuses to tell you *which* ToS term was supposedly violated\n* Claims the decision is \"final and cannot be appealed\" by anyone, human or AI\n* Won't let you speak to a human\n* Then suggests you can just \"subscribe at regular pricing\" to fix it\n\nThis isn't just bad customer service — it's likely illegal under the **EU Digital Services Act (DSA)**  (https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act)\n\n**Your rights under the DSA:**\n\n* **Article 17:** You're entitled to a *clear, specific statement of reasons* for any account restriction. \"Security reasons\" is not enough.\n* **Article 20:** You have the right to an *internal complaint mechanism* and appeal. A bot telling you the decision is final violates this.\n* **Article 25:** Platforms can't use deceptive interfaces (\"dark patterns\")  like implying a ToS violation can be fixed by paying again.\n\n**What you can do:**\n\nIf this happened to you:\n\n1. **Save your chat logs** (like I did) with the customer service\n2. Send a final message referencing DSA Articles 17, 20, and 25\n3. **File a complaint** with your national Digital Services Coordinator\n\n**Find your country's DSA authority here:**  \n[https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/dsa-dscs#1720699867912-1](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/dsa-dscs#1720699867912-1)\n\n(Scroll down to find your member state's designated authority)\n\nPerplexity is acting like EU consumer law doesn't apply to them.

From the dropdown menu select \"Request a Refund\",\n2. a new \"tell us more\" dropdown appears, select \"other\" and click next,\n3. select the perplexity app below (you might have to scroll down a bit), click next,\n4. it takes you to another page with a \"describe the issue\" text box. I included this:\n\nAfter paying for this subscription, the developer unilaterally downgraded core features integral to the service at the time of purchase, specifically usage caps tied to my subscription as advertised. This was done without prior notice or compensation. Failure of Consideration: I am not receiving the service I paid for; the app now provides substantially less value. Violation of App Store Review Guidelines: Sections 2.1 and 2.3.1 require apps to deliver promised functionality. Removing or limiting features violates the integrity of the service advertised. Unilateral Breach: The provider altered the paid service post-purchase to my detriment. Note on Policy: The standard 90-day refund window is inapplicable here. This is an ongoing breach resulting from the provider’s unilateral conduct post-modification, not a one-time defect. I request a refund as the developer failed to maintain the promised value of the subscription.",

A lot of why I value a product is the integrity of the team running it, and that there's a roadmap or at least clear path to retain long-term loyalty.\n\nA lot of users are posting their rightful gripes here, day after day, observing how disorganized Perplexity has felt. Just when one limb is cut off, another gets axed too. From the ugly font changes to chopping down Pro model usage, etc. There's no advance notice, a lack of courtesy, and frustration rising as disruptions pile up and once-happy customers seek competitors and alternatives.\n\nCan you please address what's going on?",
