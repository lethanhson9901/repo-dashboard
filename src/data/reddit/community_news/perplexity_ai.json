Requiring a card for a trial is normal, and it’s there because people abuse trials nonstop, and companies aren’t going to keep eating that cost. It's clearly obvious in this sub a lot of people have gotten Pro plans through \"friends\" or non-conventional means and now that they're caught they are flooding this sub with negativity. Yes, it’s annoying, but it’s not shady by default. The shady part would be charging you early or hiding the date, and that’s not what this is. If you start a trial with a card on file and you forget to cancel, that’s on you. Set a reminder and move on. It's only frustrating that people who received promotional deals properly get caught in the crossfire but it's not the end of the world for us to put in a card either. I also think some of the outrage is performative. People act like typing in a card number is some new betrayal, but this has been how subscriptions work for years. If you don’t want to give card info, don’t start the trial. If you do want to test it, you accept that it’s a trial that converts unless you cancel. The only problem would be unclear billing or surprise charges, and if that happens, then you have a real complaint.",

But truth be told, their Codex product is one of the best in market (I used the Codex extension for vscode, they provide really generous rate limits even for the $20 plus sub)\n\nI'm using other products right now (Gemini for writing/media generation, Claude for claude code, Perplexity for general web search/to access different models in one place, GitHub copilot, Notion, etc. for which I have the free yearly sub from my edu mail) and the experience has been much better.

Actually, Perplexity Pro has an advantage because I can use Claude from claude.ai and sometimes the servers are busy or after so many prompts, I get timed out.

But I don’t want to pay 10x more just to get back to the same level of quality I had before.\n\nI’ve been paying for Perplexity Pro for a while now, and over the past few weeks the experience has started to feel worse. It’s noticeably downgraded in ways that are hard to ignore, especially when you use it every day.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was answer quality and length. Lately the research responses feel shorter and less thorough than they used to be, as if the system is trying to cut off early. \n\nThe second thing is image generation. Earlier, I felt I could comfortably generate a fair number of images before hitting any friction. Now I run into limits much sooner, like three or four images per day. The ceiling feels much lower than it used to be.\n\nGiven the timing of the new Max version, it’s hard not to get the impression that Pro is being squeezed so that Max looks more attractive, especially for people who rely on longer answers, heavy research, or a lot of media generation.\n\nIf Perplexity wants to sell a more expensive tier, that’s fair. I wouldn’t mind paying more if it meant better service. But they should add value at the top, not quietly chip away at the value of the existing paid tier. Be explicit about limits, show the quotas clearly, and if those limits change over time, communicate that openly so users can decide if they still want to pay for what they’re getting. When things just get a bit worse with no explanation, it feels less like product evolution and more like being pushed into an upsell.\n\nOn top of that, the new Max tier is priced in the same ballpark as other premium offerings like Claude Max. If I’m being pushed to pay more anyway, then I should ask myself: why shouldn’t I just switch to Claude Max instead?",

I hope they address or fix this soon, becase as much as I really want to be a paying user, I can't if they shit over Pro users in favour of those who use Max.",

Image and video features are cool, but they’re the first things I’d unbundle into a separate pack or hard cap, and keep Pro focused on deep search, stable limits, and fast follow‑ups. \n\nIf they just said: “Pro = X research runs/day, Y file uploads, Z images, here’s what changed since last month,” most of this frustration goes away because you can judge if it’s still worth it.\nIf they insist on tiers, I’d rather see something like: Pro = stable researcher plan, Max = frontier models and media toys, and maybe a cheap “search‑only” plan for people who don’t care about images at all. I’ve ended up mixing tools (Perplexity for quick lookups, Claude for long reasoning, plus stuff like Pulse and other monitoring tools for keeping tabs on niche topics) instead of trusting one product to do everything. Main point: be upfront with limits and let Pro stay a reliable workhorse, not a slow funnel into Max.",

But in the end the solution will be to hope that new models and competition keep moving the cursor upward. \n\nI personally wouldn't pay $200 for Perplexity, it's impossible to know what you get exactly under the hood.

If Max works this well, and Pro suddenly degraded so noticeably at the same time- that can't be a coincidence. It looks like a conscious decision to increase the gap between plans and force people to upgrade.\n\nThe problem is, this isn't an honest way to sell a more expensive product. If Max was simply better than a stable Pro – okay, I pay more for more. But when Pro gets worse to make Max look better? That's manipulation, not added value. Especially since there's no official communication about changes to limits or quality – everything happens quietly, and users have to figure out for themselves what happened.\n\nAfter all, it was similar with the removal of the o3-mini model from Max – the change happened quietly overnight, without any announcements. You pay $200 a month and they take away one of the two models available only in Max without a word.\n\nAll these behaviors from Perplexity are not fair to the consumer and rather discourage and erode trust in this brand.",

It’s not that Perplexity can’t perform some tasks at a base level, because it can.\n\nLet me give you an example. I was drafting a new warehouse lease contract for a recently purchased facility. I needed a very specific format with our corporate color scheme, and the process required extensive back-and-forth. It was a highly customized lease agreement, so I iterated with Claude for roughly four to five hours, generating an entirely new contract each time.\n\nClaude maintained context on a 20-page contract for those five hours. I never had to correct it once. I simply kept iterating and refining, over and over again.\n\nWhat made this possible was Claude’s Compact. The way it’s designed is genuinely ingenious: it enables exactly this kind of sustained, context-aware iteration over long, complex documents.\n\nThis is something people in the business world don’t want to acknowledge: situations on the ground and dynamics change constantly. As you write a contract and make it more bulletproof, you keep identifying small issues and keep revising and building until you finally arrive at something solid.\n\nThat kind of work is not really possible in Perplexity.\n\nWe also use Claude for Excel spreadsheets and bulk market research. Once you’ve used all the AI tools for extended periods, you can very quickly ascertain each one’s strengths and weaknesses. They all have them.\n\nBut as an extremely heavy user of all of these tools since day one, I have found this to be the best combination: Perplexity for real-time results, appraisal assistance, or anything time-sensitive. Claude for the actual heavy lifting that would normally take a human many hours to complete.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

          "text": "Yes and no. It really depends.\n\nIt really depends because Perplexity is a great tool for web search and research. However, its research reports, whether conducted via deep research or Pro Search, are nowhere near as thorough as Gemini's or ChatGPT's web search or deep research. You also have to define what you really mean by research, because Perplexity's deep research feature takes anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes; in ChatGPT and Gemini, it could take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes or more. The extra time spent thinking indicates that it takes much longer to reason, and it synthesizes and analyzes the information more deeply and thoroughly than Perplexity.\n\n**The main difference between Gemini/between Gemini and ChatGPT, and Perplexity, on the other hand, is that Perplexity is more of a search engine for fact-checking, finding information, and giving you that information directly and quickly. However, by conducting deep research on ChatGPT or Gemini, using the right prompt and as much information as you can about your research, your task, your project, or your general query, it will analyze, synthesize, and use advanced logic and reasoning. So it really does think, while Perplexity just presents the information.**\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love Perplexity. While I was at the forefront of AI web search and research, it was the first app that could accurately find sources and conduct research reports with citations. All other AI chatbots that have web search and deep research features accurately do this now. The deep research feature on Gemini and ChatGPT is again much more thorough and extensive, and it uses a higher level of logic and reasoning, which makes sense given their larger context windows.\n\n**The models used in ChatGPT and Gemini are the maximum capacity of that model, but that same model used in Perplexity is a fine-tuned system prompted by Perplexity to act in a certain way, and strictly, they're systems prompted for web search and scanning and scouring the web using the parameters within the parameters of Perplexity. All models in Perplexity are limited to 32k context tokens. So, where Gemini 3 Pro has a 1 million context token, the equivalent of 1500 pages of text or 500,000 words, in Perpelxity, it's 32k.**\n\nThis also affects the responses it gives you, how much information it can analyze, synthesize, and understand, and how much information in the attached files it can read and understand due to Gemini's high context window. You could attach PDFs that are hundreds of pages, and it would synthesize and understand the entire thing, or it could reference specific pages if you ask it to find your information, quotes, facts, etc.\n\nThe same applies to ChatGPT with the thinking model. It has 196,000 context tokens. While again, in Perplexity, it is limited to a 32K context. Perplexity is limited by all of them because they pay for these models, which you can use with your subscription. So if they increase it, it will cost them much more. And it wouldn't be affordable, and they wouldn't make any money.\n\n**Think of it this way: Gemini 3 Pro in Gemini, you can use it up to 100% capacity. It's logic, it's reasoning, it's analysis, it's a context window. However, in Perplexity, you're using it at around 25% capacity. Those numbers aren't accurate, but they're just meant to put it into perspective.**\n\n**You can test this out yourself by giving Perplexity a prompt using Gemini 3 Pro or GPT 5.2 thinking using deep research, and then using the exact same prompt in ChatGPT and Gemini itself using the exact same models. You will see that the response it gives you will be quite different. The quality and length of the responses the Gemini and ChatGPT would give you in their own chatbots would be much better(thorough, longer, better logic and reasoning and analysis)**\n\nSee my reply to my comment for more info below:",

              "text": "Also, both ChatGPT and Gemini can find your URL. If it's available, and they're clickable links, they have improved their deep research feature at an astronomical rate, and it's night and day compared to a year ago. They've just drastically improved their source selection, the credibility of the sources, the sites they have access to, and the context of their deep research.\n\nOn the one hand, Gemini has an advantage because of Google's indexing and better access to websites and sources. Google wrote the game on the search engine; they basically invented the modern search engine as we know it. In my opinion, Gemini seems to be the most accurate for deep research, and it does give you a nice layout - spaces between paragraphs, headings, subheadings, bullet points, or in paragraph format, a mix of these things. In Pro and Ultra, you also get images, graphs, and tables. With ChatGPT, you don't really get the graphs, tables, and the nice layout, but it's also great at source selection, providing citations, and I find ChatGPT's deep research to be the most logically coherent and analytical, and it also has the best context. \n\n**For research, whether it is academic research, business research, for your startup, at work, or for any personal query or topic you're interested in, Perplexity is great. However, it's better suited for the preliminary stages of research, just to get a quick analysis or a quick scoop of information. I like to think of Perplexity as a brainstorming tool and also a great tool for quick fact-checking, updates, news, information, and definitions.**\n\n**While Gemini and ChatGPT are definitely the main AI tools to use for the writing process due to their context windows, I then jump into Gemini or ChatGPT for even more in-depth research. For instance, I might research US intervention in the Middle East and what has led to it since the 1970s. I would start by proposing a research question or asking a bunch of questions of Perplexity to find the best scholars, most prominent professors, researchers, or most prominent academic journals on these topics, or to get an overall consensus on the body of academic research.** \n\n**From there, once I gather some information, I will feed it into Gemini or ChatGPT for more in-depth analysis, pinpoint the exact sources and their abstracts, and dive deeper into each author's work and get my research started.** \n\n**Therefore, Perplexity is not the \"best\" AI tool for research. However, it is still a \"great\" tool for research, and the best tool for web search, i.e., it's a great replacement for everyday Google searches. It is the tool you should use first for brainstorming or to get some ideas going, and then for the actual work, analysis, and more in-depth, thorough research. ChatGPT and Gemini are better options.** \n\n**So it goes like this:** \n\n\n\n**1) Perplexity: Quick information, fact-checking, updates, news, and then generating ideas, brainstorming and planning.** \n\n**2) Gemini and ChatGPT: More in-depth, thorough research writing, research reports, large content generation (such as reports, blogs, papers), or helping with lengthier work using their Canvas features. Ensure you use Projects in ChatGPT and Noteboard in Gemini to organize your research and your workflow, projects, or tasks.**  \n\n**Eg, I have a notebooklm notebook and a ChatGPT project dedicated to each research paper I am writing as a university student. It helps me organize my notes, thoughts, ideas, outlines, research, etc. (the same workflow can be used for business, work, and content creators)**",

I use it for very simple things in my life. Last week I used it three times. First was researching sustainable packaging options for a client deck. Second was comparing standing desks because my back is killing me. Third was learning about heat pumps because I got tired of not understanding what people were talking about. My process is pretty simple. I ask one focused question and let it run. I skim the structure first to see if it's even going in the right direction. Then I open a few of the sources it cites to sanity check that it's not hallucinating. Usually I have one or two follow-up questions to narrow things down. The standing desk research was honestly overkill but I saved the report anyway. The packaging research saved me probably four hours of manual searching. The heat pump thing I just wanted to understand the basics and it worked.",

A month without hearing anything from a company that was releasing almost weekly updates is odd this far past the holidays, in my opinion.\n\nMy two cents are (1) it's either related to a possible acquisition or (2) it's related to an ongoing or potential lawsuit. They've been receiving a lot of heat from Amazon over the Comet assistant, which became legal action just this past November.\n\nThey do have a major recent lawsuit put against them from The Times on Dec. 5th, claiming Perplexity ignored robots.txt and generated outputs identical or substantially similar to its content. The timing is more than a little coincidental. I will also mention we heard this same argument raised against OpenAI when they first came on the scene and that legal action is still ongoing. Dying media is going to attack whoever they perceive as a threat to their profit margin. If people are not clicking through to view their page, then they're not seeing their ads, which constitutes a loss of revenue.\n\nAll this is to say, my educated guess is that this is probably due to legal issues.",

The new \"Thinking with 3 Pro\" toggle is stronger (responds with cool custom layouts) and AI Overviews are starting to blend with AI Mode. Plus, the Gemini app is finally becoming less clumsy every week.\n\nBut I’m still figuring out where the overlap ends.\n\nGemini hallucinates a lot with its outdated training data. For example, as you discuss the AI industry, it confidently cites old models like GPT-4o or Sonnet 3.5 as current SOTA. These hiccups add up\n\nPerplexity Pro Search is still my daily deep search utility. I find myself needing it \\~12 times a day because I know Google or Gemini (or ChatGPT) will hallucinate the answer.\n\nCurious about your workflows. How many times a day do you feel forced to use Perplexity because you know the others (including ChatGPT) will fail? Do you feel Google is catching up fast enough to make Perplexity Search redundant?\n\nEDIT:\n\nWith a US VPN, I was able to try Deep Search in G AI Mode for the first time. It looks good. Not sure what the usage limits are when it rolls out globally but that is a real threat to Perplexity Search",

From a business perspective, I understand why they are doing this, but this is not sustainable for Perplexity - especially as they throttle pro (because it is watered down from free users) and the only solution for me is upgrading to much more expensive model. \n\nP has a great product. I use spaces for both personal and business.   \n  \nHowever, where G is killing them is in their token size of uploads. I use G GEM for one of my main business time suck tasks, and it now performs this task very well (as soon as I got the prompt right). Perplexity had me breaking these files down so much it became a cat and mouse game to figure out where to cut it up to get it to work and then the prompt became unwieldy to make sure it put together the whole picture of what I needed. I acknowledge my own lack of prompt knowledge, but I don't have time to become a prompt engineer, I have to run my business. \n\nThe reality for me as a non-coding businessman, I am not doing extensive lab research on ameba or dna, or coding some complex task, I just need a reliable result.   \n  \nYes, Ai can make mistakes, but the source thing is becoming less valuable to me over time as both models are getting better and hallucinating. We have a long way to go in this, and I can usually see something questionable, and when I do, I fact check it. For me, this will be the breaking point with P.\n\nIt is WHEN, not if, G will catch up and surpass P because they have the money to do so. Until then I will use both.",

          "text": "I read your entire post, and from what I understand, you're complaining about a service you didn't even pay for, and you're trying to justify it by saying that if it were worth $20/month, you would do it. \"It's not worth $20/month, therefore I cheat, and I use different emails and codes.\" You're still complaining, you're not paying for this in any way, so you have no right to complain. Also, you're saying it's not $20/month that doesn't justify Perplexity Pro, and you would never pay $20/month for it, but then you still use Perplexity Pro. So clearly there is some use case and value in it for you, but you just want it for free while the rest of us are paying. \n\nI've been a Perplexity Pro subscriber since February 2025. After using it for literally 2 hours for free, I subscribed right away. I saw the value in it and could justify paying less than a dollar a day for a great tool like this. I'd consider myself a heavy user, and I usually run about 30-50 queries per day on Perplexity, sometimes even more, and I've never hit a limit. I've never seen a weekly limit, and I've never had one. \n\nNow I'm no bootlicker. I'm not trying to protect Perplexity. I have no say in it, have no incentive, and I don't get paid by them. But I've been a paid user, and I've raised so many criticisms in this subreddit. Now I realize that getting the codes, free trials, or whatnot gives you access to Perplexity Pro, and it is a flaw that after 250 messages in 4 days, you hit a weekly limit.\n\nStill, I don't know if Perplexity knows you are using different emails or whatever. I doubt they do. But again, your criticisms have no merit because you're not a paid user. If you were a paid user, I'd be like, \"Okay, you're paying $20/month for a service for which you should be getting what your money's worth.\" Even if you were a paid member, you have to realize that for $20/month, you're getting access to so much....You have access to multiple different models, about a dozen different features in the Perplexity app, and you have to realize it's precisely because people like you and other people whom they gave annual free subscriptions to that they are running into issues.   \n  \nNow, granted, it might be due to their mismanagement and giving away free subscriptions left and right, and now they're trying to control it and mitigate it. It is costing them a lot. Quite frankly, I don't think Perplexity is making any profits at all, since it's costing them so much to maintain all these different models, and they have increased their user base exponentially over the past two years. But it's because people like you abuse this. There's a set limit for a reason, and AI does cost a lot of money; it's not free. You truly think Perplexity is making any money on the Pro subscriptions? They're really not. They're losing money on pro subscriptions similar to ChatGPT Plus. They only make money on Max subscriptions, and that's maybe less than 10% of the paid subscribers.   \n  \nThe only thing that's keeping them afloat is the Comet browser since it's the only AI browser that truly works and does autonomous AI tasks, and their different partnerships, like with Snapchat or Ronaldo. \n\nGoing back to your point, it sounds like you're a power user because 250 queries in 4 days is about 60 per day. I'm not saying it's your fault you're using a lot, but you are a power user. I'm not trying to justify Perplexity Max and that you should pay 10 times more, but I'm just saying that some of the complaints you're raising are valid. But at the same time, you have to realize that there are so many other people like you who use different emails and get these deals, free trials and annual subscriptions. It ramps up the use case, and it costs Perplexity a lot of money. They truly can't maintain it, which is why you're seeing the weekly limit. And you, being a power user, are complaning even when you scam your way and create fake emails to get \"pro\". It's just so ironic, and the audacity is crazy.",

              "text": "Also, even though I'm a paid Perplexity Pro subscriber, there seems to be a glitch in Perplexity with the usage limits. For instance, for the longest time, I used Perplexity Labs, and although I only had 50 per month, the number would stay at 47 for days. I swear I would use labs 5 times a day, and after a couple of days, if the number was still in the same range or reset. \n\nYou stated in one of your comments that \"BESIDE, I'm not the one offering hundreds of thousands of free pro subscriptions to everyone, it's Perplexity that does that  \nIf they are losing money because of people who use them, then they just need to stop making them, then they won't lose money anymore and start being a good product again.\"\n\nThis is quite telling, and by your logic, just because they offer it, you should abuse it, take advantage of it and ruin it for the rest of us. That's like saying, \"Oh, it's not my fault that the bank is giving easy loans, for example. Therefore, I got 20 different loans with different fake businesses and scammed my way through them. It's the flaw of the system.\" \n\nThey're doing a crackdown now on the free trials and the annual memberships they gave away precisely because people like you. You're ruining it for everyone else. Right now, I have Perplexity Pro for $5/month because I'm a university student with my university validating my university email. I got a huge discount. But this is for one year only. When that ends, I'm not going to create another email and try to scan my way through.\n\nThe difference is that if you are a paid subscriber, you can email Perplexity support to raise your concerns, and they will reply right away. But you don't have that option because you are getting your free trial with a different email, and you are still complaining. Honestly, you should be grateful that you can create different emails and use them through this loophole.",

Just a few days ago I noticed a distinct shift when the system clearly switched to Sonnet after a second or two working on the prompt I provided.

It used to go for 60 + sources. \n\nIt also writes very briefly too. \n\nThis deterioration in UX is coming from cost cutting. \n\nIt’s still the best at web search but recently competitors have caught up. If you are doing simple searchers perplexity is redundant. If you are coding heavy you might as well cancel to subscribe to Claude which is doing so well now\n\nIf perplexity doesn’t get its shit together for web search I’m afraid there’s no reason to sub to it anymore. It’s not exactly cheap tbh. I blame it on their growth strategy trying to onboard a bunch of free pro users which ruined their unit cost and thus have to penalized everyone.",

True thing is that the quality of the answer is strictly depending on the quality of the prompt but it's also true that Research quality has dropped.\n\nExample: I have a space with a strict set of instructions and a file with a set of formatting rules for the output. Advanced models (like Claude Sonnet) can do the task AND adhere to the rules without problems in search mode, while using the same prompt in Research mode means that 99 times on 100 it will ignore part or the whole instructions or it will say that some file on the shared files of the space don't exist (they are there and search finds them pretty easily).\n\nNow, from a few days, research also will refuse to use python most of the times while advanced models do complex tasks with python without issues.\n\nFrankly, I think that the problem stays in the middle: the user should use correct prompts and some of the models like Research have issues.",

I’m switching to a combination of mainly Gemini, Claude, and ChatGPT instead (already in use, but Gemini got a huge boost with v3), since I haven’t found a single tool that covers everything in one place like Perplexity does (although Google and Gemini come pretty close, even if the ecosystem is still a bit fragmented). I’ll test this setup for three days, and if I don’t miss Perplexity during that time, our org will cancel the subscription completely (I’m the main user and we are small).\n\nFor context: I personally used Perplexity very intensively on a daily basis as a de facto Google replacement, and as a first step for factual searches before feeding the results into other frontier LLMs (mainly Claude and ChatGPT).

They’re the jack of all trades but master of none. None of their features are “bad”, it’s just that Claude, Gemini, Grok etc are great at some things but subpar in others. \n\nThat being said ChatGPT does have the best long memory feature and best context and analysis in deep research specifically. It truly seems like it analyzed the information, facts, data and sources and used critical thinking and deep reasoning to give a report. \n\nGemini with 3 pro has been the same if not better. Gemini has the advantage of googles indexing, access to courses and sites, and the Google ecosystem and workspace apps. And Geminis deep research is quite extensive and comprehensive. It also uses visuals like images, charts, tables, and graphs in deep research and you can use it in connection with uploaded files, attaching a Google doc or slide or a notebooklm notebook and doing deep research on top of that. It also has the advantage of 1M context tokens so it can write out longer reports and read more pages and words for your uploaded files and handles longer prompts quite well. \n\nHowever it’s still slightly below ChatGPT in terms of the analysis, reasoning and context of your prompt. \n\nBoth ChatGPT and Gemini are great alternatives if not better options. They’ve improved their deep research and search in general rapidly, that a regular web search on either one is more extensive, thorough and logical than even a labs search on perplexity. \n\nPerplexity just gathers random facts that are somewhat related to your topic, query or question using RAG and their deep research has no depth, analysis or substance. \n\nI don’t understand how people do “research” on perplexity. It seems the word “research” has truly lost meaning. Perplexity is simply a good ai search app that’s fast and uses references for its answers. But Gemini and ChatGPT use references and even more real time and up to date sources and info. \n\nThis is all coming from a perplexity pro subscriber and supporter in the past 2 years. They have multiple issues and the features seem watered down and weak compared to Gemini and ChatGPT. \n\nIf you were to choose one get Gemini AI pro since it’s the same price as perplexity pro and ChatGPT plus. But it gives you access to notebooklm pro, 2TB of cloud storage, and 20 deep research queries per day while ChatGPT plus gives you 25 per month and only 15 of those are deep research, the rest are “limited deep research”.",

For example, the context window is too small, which is annoying, let's face it. But summarizing solves the problem. It often rereads my notes, creates graphs directly, and is quite accurate. I use Gemini 3 Pro, which is the best. However, not enough queries per week! For paying users... they ask for a bit more... and that's really frustrating... 300 queries isn't enough! Double that would be the minimum...\n\nIt allows adult users to finally be considered adults. Which is very rare with Grok. And no, I don't do anything illegal or punishable.  I'm a mother, but yes, I have consenting NSFW content.\n\nIt's my favorite AI so far, and I don't regret subscribing at all.\n\nI think this AI deserves to be more widely known.

Just for asking questions on the study material, I've found Spaces to be superior.\n\nCurious to hear your opinions.",
