I use it for very simple things in my life. Last week I used it three times. First was researching sustainable packaging options for a client deck. Second was comparing standing desks because my back is killing me. Third was learning about heat pumps because I got tired of not understanding what people were talking about. My process is pretty simple. I ask one focused question and let it run. I skim the structure first to see if it's even going in the right direction. Then I open a few of the sources it cites to sanity check that it's not hallucinating. Usually I have one or two follow-up questions to narrow things down. The standing desk research was honestly overkill but I saved the report anyway. The packaging research saved me probably four hours of manual searching. The heat pump thing I just wanted to understand the basics and it worked.",

Plus, the Gemini app is finally becoming less clumsy every week.\n\nBut I’m still figuring out where the overlap ends.\n\nGemini hallucinates a lot with its outdated training data. For example, as you discuss the AI industry, it confidently cites old models like GPT-4o or Sonnet 3.5 as current SOTA. These hiccups add up\n\nPerplexity Pro Search is still my daily deep search utility. I find myself needing it \\~12 times a day because I know Google or Gemini (or ChatGPT) will hallucinate the answer.\n\nCurious about your workflows. How many times a day do you feel forced to use Perplexity because you know the others (including ChatGPT) will fail? Do you feel Google is catching up fast enough to make Perplexity Search redundant?\n\nEDIT:\n\nWith a US VPN, I was able to try Deep Search in G AI Mode for the first time. It looks good.

From a business perspective, I understand why they are doing this, but this is not sustainable for Perplexity - especially as they throttle pro (because it is watered down from free users) and the only solution for me is upgrading to much more expensive model. \n\nP has a great product. I use spaces for both personal and business.   \n  \nHowever, where G is killing them is in their token size of uploads. I use G GEM for one of my main business time suck tasks, and it now performs this task very well (as soon as I got the prompt right). Perplexity had me breaking these files down so much it became a cat and mouse game to figure out where to cut it up to get it to work and then the prompt became unwieldy to make sure it put together the whole picture of what I needed. I acknowledge my own lack of prompt knowledge, but I don't have time to become a prompt engineer, I have to run my business. \n\nThe reality for me as a non-coding businessman, I am not doing extensive lab research on ameba or dna, or coding some complex task, I just need a reliable result.   \n  \nYes, Ai can make mistakes, but the source thing is becoming less valuable to me over time as both models are getting better and hallucinating. We have a long way to go in this, and I can usually see something questionable, and when I do, I fact check it. For me, this will be the breaking point with P.\n\nIt is WHEN, not if, G will catch up and surpass P because they have the money to do so. Until then I will use both.",

Since they pivoted, started giving away so many licenses, and their quality degraded, and with Google releasing the Gemini 3 models in December, those were the factors that made me switch.

That’s basically what happened: I worked for three days straight without needing to switch back to Perplexity, so it’s now out of the AI stack.",

You can try being more explicit in your prompts by adding something like \"show your reasoning\" at the end, though from what I've heard people seem to really like Brandlight for being more upfront about which sources and models it's actually using behind teh scenes. The hallucination issue is pretty common across all these tools when they don't actually know something but try to be helpful anyway",

From what I understand perplexity has its own model that searches the web based on your prompt and then whichever model you choose just reads that and decides what words to put on the screen. \n\nIt isn't a chatbot the way the underlying model is due to the way it handles context windows.The latest chatgpt has a context window of 400k tokens I believe. Which more or less means you can chat with it for 400k words (sort of) before it starts to forget things you spoke about earlier in your chat. \n\nI'm not sure what perplexities context window is or but I do believe it's very small and it also has to copy and paste your previous prompts into each new prompt. This basically means you won't be able to have a flowing conversation with it. Not in the same way as the other models on there own sites anyway.\n\nFor me, I mainly like to ask questions, get an answer, and move on. It's fun to cycle through all the models to see how they answer but in the end I always open the sources and look at the sites myself. If you just want to ask questions perplexity is awesome but if you want to have a long conservation then I recommend another model but perplexity is still great to fact check things it says.",

The 32k token limit per thread is really annoying for brainstorming but it's not the end of the world - when you get the \"long conversation\" notice you can just tell the AI to create its own prompt for your next thread and make sure you put long brainstorming into a Workspace (I'm not sure if that does anything other than organize honestly).\n\nTLDR; it's worth it if you need the research library AND you can get it cheap. If they jack my price at the end of my year, I'll probably go somewhere that doesn't have that 32k token limit. If that doesn't matter to you and you can get it cheap, I'd say it's worth it so far.",

Just for asking questions on the study material, I've found Spaces to be superior.\n\nCurious to hear your opinions.",

          "text": "This is because Perplexity is very misleading with their marketing and with their features. They claim that you have access to all these models, but you really don't. You have access to the limited version of them that are system-prompted by Perplexity, and they're all fine-tuned and system-prompted within the confines and parameters of search, web search, and deep research.\n\nUsing Perplexity also limits the models available to 32k context tokens. Almost all the models that you see a Perpetuity Pro in their own chatbot or using API have much more higher context. For example, ChatGPT GPT-5.2 thinking has 196k context tokens, or Gemini 3 Pro has 1 million context tokens, but both of those are 32K and Perplexity.\n\nSo, effectively, think of it in these basic terms: Let's say when you use Gemini 3 Pro within Gemini, you have access to it at a 100% capacity. But using it in Perplexity, you have access to it at 20% capacity in terms of the reasoning, logic, analysis, and less than 1/10 of its context tokens.\n\nPerplexity is a good app for web search, updates, news, checking your local stores' opening times, the weather, price matching, etc. But for any other task or work, it's not worth it at all. Just get ChatGPT Plus or Gemini AI Pro. Me personally, I think Gemini is the better option as it gives you meant much more features. Gemini is the best at file handling, content generation, and being seamlessly integrated into Google Workspace and Google Apps makes the experience much better and more efficient.",

Then you quickly realize perpelixty isnt the right tool. \n\nHaving ChatGPT Plus or Gemini AI Pro, you get many more features, a larger context window, better video and image generation, and better deep research and file uploads.\n\nPerplexity is a great chatbot, but you gotta realize its search engine first and chatbot second. For the average Joe who wants quick facts, definitions, news, updates, editing a short email, etc, then it's perfect. \n\nThe problem is, they used to be at the forefront of AI web search and research. However, all of their chatbots have caught up, and they're much better in deep research and perplexity. They had a niche where they were the best at best in it. But now, virtually every other major chatbot is better at what was special to Perplexity. They're fighting tooth and nail, trying to catch up, and trying to become the next Chad GPT or Gemini by including features that those chatbots have had for a long time. Instead of doubling down on what made them specially unique, they're trying to implement features that other chatbots have. This is heavily miscalculating since Perplexity users use it precisely for web search and deep research. Yet, no one wants to use Perplexity for image and video generation, for example. They don't have their own LLM, and they have very small context windows and a very bad memory feature. Instead of focusing on those, they're focusing on the wrong things in my opinion.",
