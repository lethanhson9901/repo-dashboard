I use it for very simple things in my life. Last week I used it three times. First was researching sustainable packaging options for a client deck. Second was comparing standing desks because my back is killing me. Third was learning about heat pumps because I got tired of not understanding what people were talking about. My process is pretty simple. I ask one focused question and let it run. I skim the structure first to see if it's even going in the right direction. Then I open a few of the sources it cites to sanity check that it's not hallucinating. Usually I have one or two follow-up questions to narrow things down. The standing desk research was honestly overkill but I saved the report anyway. The packaging research saved me probably four hours of manual searching. The heat pump thing I just wanted to understand the basics and it worked.",

          "text": "This is because Perplexity is very misleading with their marketing and with their features. They claim that you have access to all these models, but you really don't. You have access to the limited version of them that are system-prompted by Perplexity, and they're all fine-tuned and system-prompted within the confines and parameters of search, web search, and deep research.\n\nUsing Perplexity also limits the models available to 32k context tokens. Almost all the models that you see a Perpetuity Pro in their own chatbot or using API have much more higher context. For example, ChatGPT GPT-5.2 thinking has 196k context tokens, or Gemini 3 Pro has 1 million context tokens, but both of those are 32K and Perplexity.\n\nSo, effectively, think of it in these basic terms: Let's say when you use Gemini 3 Pro within Gemini, you have access to it at a 100% capacity. But using it in Perplexity, you have access to it at 20% capacity in terms of the reasoning, logic, analysis, and less than 1/10 of its context tokens.\n\nPerplexity is a good app for web search, updates, news, checking your local stores' opening times, the weather, price matching, etc. But for any other task or work, it's not worth it at all. Just get ChatGPT Plus or Gemini AI Pro. Me personally, I think Gemini is the better option as it gives you meant much more features. Gemini is the best at file handling, content generation, and being seamlessly integrated into Google Workspace and Google Apps makes the experience much better and more efficient.",

Then you quickly realize perpelixty isnt the right tool. \n\nHaving ChatGPT Plus or Gemini AI Pro, you get many more features, a larger context window, better video and image generation, and better deep research and file uploads.\n\nPerplexity is a great chatbot, but you gotta realize its search engine first and chatbot second. For the average Joe who wants quick facts, definitions, news, updates, editing a short email, etc, then it's perfect. \n\nThe problem is, they used to be at the forefront of AI web search and research. However, all of their chatbots have caught up, and they're much better in deep research and perplexity. They had a niche where they were the best at best in it. But now, virtually every other major chatbot is better at what was special to Perplexity. They're fighting tooth and nail, trying to catch up, and trying to become the next Chad GPT or Gemini by including features that those chatbots have had for a long time. Instead of doubling down on what made them specially unique, they're trying to implement features that other chatbots have. This is heavily miscalculating since Perplexity users use it precisely for web search and deep research. Yet, no one wants to use Perplexity for image and video generation, for example. They don't have their own LLM, and they have very small context windows and a very bad memory feature. Instead of focusing on those, they're focusing on the wrong things in my opinion.",

The new \"Thinking with 3 Pro\" toggle is stronger (responds with cool custom layouts) and AI Overviews are starting to blend with AI Mode. Plus, the Gemini app is finally becoming less clumsy every week.\n\nBut I’m still figuring out where the overlap ends.\n\nGemini hallucinates a lot with its outdated training data. For example, as you discuss the AI industry, it confidently cites old models like GPT-4o or Sonnet 3.5 as current SOTA. These hiccups add up\n\nPerplexity Pro Search is still my daily deep search utility. I find myself needing it \\~12 times a day because I know Google or Gemini (or ChatGPT) will hallucinate the answer.\n\nCurious about your workflows. How many times a day do you feel forced to use Perplexity because you know the others (including ChatGPT) will fail? Do you feel Google is catching up fast enough to make Perplexity Search redundant?\n\nEDIT:\n\nWith a US VPN, I was able to try Deep Search in G AI Mode for the first time. It looks good. Not sure what the usage limits are when it rolls out globally but that is a real threat to Perplexity Search",

From a business perspective, I understand why they are doing this, but this is not sustainable for Perplexity - especially as they throttle pro (because it is watered down from free users) and the only solution for me is upgrading to much more expensive model. \n\nP has a great product. I use spaces for both personal and business.   \n  \nHowever, where G is killing them is in their token size of uploads. I use G GEM for one of my main business time suck tasks, and it now performs this task very well (as soon as I got the prompt right). Perplexity had me breaking these files down so much it became a cat and mouse game to figure out where to cut it up to get it to work and then the prompt became unwieldy to make sure it put together the whole picture of what I needed. I acknowledge my own lack of prompt knowledge, but I don't have time to become a prompt engineer, I have to run my business. \n\nThe reality for me as a non-coding businessman, I am not doing extensive lab research on ameba or dna, or coding some complex task, I just need a reliable result.   \n  \nYes, Ai can make mistakes, but the source thing is becoming less valuable to me over time as both models are getting better and hallucinating. We have a long way to go in this, and I can usually see something questionable, and when I do, I fact check it. For me, this will be the breaking point with P.\n\nIt is WHEN, not if, G will catch up and surpass P because they have the money to do so. Until then I will use both.",

A month without hearing anything from a company that was releasing almost weekly updates is odd this far past the holidays, in my opinion.\n\nMy two cents are (1) it's either related to a possible acquisition or (2) it's related to an ongoing or potential lawsuit. They've been receiving a lot of heat from Amazon over the Comet assistant, which became legal action just this past November.\n\nThey do have a major recent lawsuit put against them from The Times on Dec. 5th, claiming Perplexity ignored robots.txt and generated outputs identical or substantially similar to its content. The timing is more than a little coincidental. I will also mention we heard this same argument raised against OpenAI when they first came on the scene and that legal action is still ongoing. Dying media is going to attack whoever they perceive as a threat to their profit margin. If people are not clicking through to view their page, then they're not seeing their ads, which constitutes a loss of revenue.\n\nAll this is to say, my educated guess is that this is probably due to legal issues.",

I’ll test this setup for three days, and if I don’t miss Perplexity during that time, our org will cancel the subscription completely (I’m the main user and we are small).\n\nFor context: I personally used Perplexity very intensively on a daily basis as a de facto Google replacement, and as a first step for factual searches before feeding the results into other frontier LLMs (mainly Claude and ChatGPT).

They’re the jack of all trades but master of none. None of their features are “bad”, it’s just that Claude, Gemini, Grok etc are great at some things but subpar in others. \n\nThat being said ChatGPT does have the best long memory feature and best context and analysis in deep research specifically. It truly seems like it analyzed the information, facts, data and sources and used critical thinking and deep reasoning to give a report. \n\nGemini with 3 pro has been the same if not better. Gemini has the advantage of googles indexing, access to courses and sites, and the Google ecosystem and workspace apps. And Geminis deep research is quite extensive and comprehensive. It also uses visuals like images, charts, tables, and graphs in deep research and you can use it in connection with uploaded files, attaching a Google doc or slide or a notebooklm notebook and doing deep research on top of that. It also has the advantage of 1M context tokens so it can write out longer reports and read more pages and words for your uploaded files and handles longer prompts quite well. \n\nHowever it’s still slightly below ChatGPT in terms of the analysis, reasoning and context of your prompt. \n\nBoth ChatGPT and Gemini are great alternatives if not better options. They’ve improved their deep research and search in general rapidly, that a regular web search on either one is more extensive, thorough and logical than even a labs search on perplexity. \n\nPerplexity just gathers random facts that are somewhat related to your topic, query or question using RAG and their deep research has no depth, analysis or substance. \n\nI don’t understand how people do “research” on perplexity. It seems the word “research” has truly lost meaning. Perplexity is simply a good ai search app that’s fast and uses references for its answers. But Gemini and ChatGPT use references and even more real time and up to date sources and info. \n\nThis is all coming from a perplexity pro subscriber and supporter in the past 2 years. They have multiple issues and the features seem watered down and weak compared to Gemini and ChatGPT. \n\nIf you were to choose one get Gemini AI pro since it’s the same price as perplexity pro and ChatGPT plus. But it gives you access to notebooklm pro, 2TB of cloud storage, and 20 deep research queries per day while ChatGPT plus gives you 25 per month and only 15 of those are deep research, the rest are “limited deep research”.",

From what I understand perplexity has its own model that searches the web based on your prompt and then whichever model you choose just reads that and decides what words to put on the screen. \n\nIt isn't a chatbot the way the underlying model is due to the way it handles context windows.The latest chatgpt has a context window of 400k tokens I believe. Which more or less means you can chat with it for 400k words (sort of) before it starts to forget things you spoke about earlier in your chat. \n\nI'm not sure what perplexities context window is or but I do believe it's very small and it also has to copy and paste your previous prompts into each new prompt. This basically means you won't be able to have a flowing conversation with it. Not in the same way as the other models on there own sites anyway.\n\nFor me, I mainly like to ask questions, get an answer, and move on. It's fun to cycle through all the models to see how they answer but in the end I always open the sources and look at the sites myself. If you just want to ask questions perplexity is awesome but if you want to have a long conservation then I recommend another model but perplexity is still great to fact check things it says.",

I use GPT 5.2 in Thinking Mode primarily and am sometimes there all day. The 32k token limit per thread is really annoying for brainstorming but it's not the end of the world - when you get the \"long conversation\" notice you can just tell the AI to create its own prompt for your next thread and make sure you put long brainstorming into a Workspace (I'm not sure if that does anything other than organize honestly).\n\nTLDR; it's worth it if you need the research library AND you can get it cheap. If they jack my price at the end of my year, I'll probably go somewhere that doesn't have that 32k token limit. If that doesn't matter to you and you can get it cheap, I'd say it's worth it so far.",

I think i was one of the first paying customers, I loved perplexity when it came out, as soon as you had a plan I jumped on it through solidarity.

But the recent pushyness is driving me to not want to use it at all anymore.\n\nI used to pay for perplexity, you know why I don't anymore? Because I get it free through literally almost every other subscription that I have, 5 times is not an exaggeration, there probably is more that I haven't checked. \n\nI can't use it, i can't transfer it, I can't stack it either. \n\nSo I really just want to continue using it without getting a popup and being switched to lower tiers every time I use it because I don't have your 200$ plan. \n\nI'm not sure if people who actually pay for their pro plan receive these too, but imho it's not profitable because you get it for free everywhere and that is not our fault.",
