The image you shared appears to show a panel discussion (likely from decades ago) with a geometric logo on the wall that resembles Perplexity’s current branding, sparking online speculation.\nPerplexity’s Logo Origin\nPerplexity’s logo was designed by Philadelphia-based branding agency Smith & Diction in 2023. According to the designers, the logo intentionally combines several symbolic elements:[ebaqdesign +2]\n•\tComputer cursor – representing digital access and the typing experience\n•\tAsterisk – referencing how Perplexity cites all its sources\n•\tOpen book – symbolizing knowledge\n•\tRevolving doors/windows – representing multiple perspectives and the internet\nThe design team described it as capturing “the idea that whatever you type into Perplexity seamlessly transforms into an answer”.[instagram]\nWhy the Similarity Exists\nGeometric logos built from intersecting lines forming star or asterisk shapes are extremely common in design history—universities, corporations, and organizations have used similar motifs for decades. The building in your photo appears to display such a logo, but this doesn’t indicate copying. Smith & Diction documented their design process publicly, showing how they evolved the concept from a blinking cursor to the final asterisk-inspired icon.[linkedin]\nWhile Perplexity has faced various lawsuits over content (from The New York Times, Encyclopedia Britannica, and Reddit), none involve allegations of logo theft. The visual resemblance to older logos is likely coincidental given how ubiquitous this geometric style has been throughout design history.[nytimes +1]",

      "text": "EDIT: so in the end, it's anything but a \"quick\" review, sorry about that 😁\n\nTLDR: Perplexity Max is a whole different product and Pro plan looks really poor when you've tried Max.\n\nSo I decided recently to jump and try the Max plan at least for one month because I'm one of the few users that really enjoy using Perplexity Pro and do so absolutely non stop to look for answers for pretty everything.\n\nLet's start with the stuff that is not great since it's $200 bucks :\n\n\\- No GPT pro searches/GPT deep searches\n\n\\- No selection for thinking/reasoning Low-Medium-High-Extra high.\n\n\\- Context is lower than on official apps. But I never had issues with that one.\n\n\\- No coding app so it's can't 100% replace Claude Code or GPT Codex. But I understand this would be way too expensive.\n\n\\- Labs is still a useless mess. This product shouldn't exist like this. They should either revamp it or discontinue it.\n\n\\- Comet assistant is powerful (certainly using better models like Sonnet or GPT when needed) but I find that the Agent is still a gimmick. Still doesn't really know where to clic, taking useless screenshots to find solutions, and so on... But it's pretty ok at multi tab searching (looking for data by opening multiple tabs).\n\nNow besides those, my experience so far goes miles beyond my expectations. I don't even understand why they don't communicate more about it. Probably because Pro would look like shit compared to Max?\n\n\\- First of all : I have been doing 10 days of INTENSIVE vibe coding and research. Meaning, hundreds (more than a thousand?) of Opus 4.5 thinking requests with dozens of heavy documents, dozens of thousands of lines of code. Not a single time did I get a limit. No plan I know would offer me that besides Claude Max $200 plan. Opus 4.5 is beyond expensive and this is incredible. Most of my requests cost probably much more than $1 in API usage.\n\n\\- Quality of Opus 4.5 Thinking vs the official Claude app? Equal if not superior. I spent a few hours doing benchmarks because that was my biggest fear: I asked GPT to craft prompts for extremely complex technical tasks, then sent the prompt to both Opus 4.5 Thinking models and compared outputs through GPT, Gemini and Opus : the fact that the Perplexity version fetches more data online gives it an advantage. So they don't downgrade Opus.\n\n\\- Deep Research : WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. F. ?! I had completely stopped using Deep Research in Pro because any well prompted search with Gemini 3 Pro or GPT 5.2 Thinking was giving a way better quality output than Deep Research that was just an hallucinating joke. On Max, it pulls at least 10x the number of sources it did in Pro, on average 60 to 100 sources. With a good prompt it's transforming into the most powerful AI research tool I've seen when you are looking for granular data. You get HUGE reports and I didn't see any hallucinations, sources have nothing to do with the ones from the Pro search. If you look for a very specific information, it will find it. It most certainly doesn't use the same cheap model to search the sources. Probably at least Sonnet, maybe Opus. And it creates beautiful presentations. What Labs should be able to do. It's vastly superior to Gemini Deep Research and for most tasks it's better than GPT Deep research but I would't know for research papers, I didn't try nor compare.\n\n\\- Sources quality : multiple sources with professional, scientific or financial data that are expensive and available for Max users.\n\n\\- Unlimited image generation is useful, especially when you can prompt \"generate 15 images with various clothes\" and you'll get them.\n\nMy heart would balance between Claude Max and Perplexity because for $200 Claude Max tier you get a huge Claude Code quota. But you don't get to use the other models and it's very useful to me to be able to jump from Opus to GPT, to Gemini, and so on, when I need different types of answers from a variety of models.\n\nI'll finish with the KILLER feature for me: Spaces in Perplexity, especially Perplexity Max, are impossible to beat. I've tried everything with GPT, Claude, Gemini... nothing is as good as the spaces. I'm adding dozens of documents, saving chats as files for context keeping, doing some research and saving it into relevant spaces, adding links like Github repos: when I open a chat window in a space, I already know that the model is going to deep dive in the context, go through my entire GitHub, scrap through dozens, or even a hundred links at light speed. This is pure power.\n\nNow my typical workflow is research, brainstorming by using the best data available and then opening a PR on GitHub through my Perplexity chat. All with Opus 4.5 Thinking, obviously. It's incredibly powerful and convenient. Only the GitHub access is slow, or the process to work with GitHub. You have to wait a long time to press Approve for each change. No agentic features and Comet refuses to approve changes to GitHub automatically for security reasons.\n\nSo yeah, sorry it's a very long post but it's been a few days now that I wanted to share my experience for people curious about Max.\n\nIt's a bit sad for Pro users because I can see now how the Pro tier is \"bad\" compared to Max. It's still worth it for free or if people really want to be able to use the nice UI, good UX with memory and access to multiple models easily.\n\nAgain, I don't understand how Perplexity doesn't communicate better about Max power. I hope they don't nerf it because I don't see how they can make money... Anyway, it's going to be hard for me to go back to pro. But it's very costly, which is normal for what you get, except Labs...\n\nAny Max brothers out there, feel free to share your experience and usage. I'm sure there are plenty of ways to use all that unlimited (?) power!",

Whatever margin they could make from monthly pro users who weren’t costing them $20 worth of electricity...  It’s pennies compared to the enterprise & max subs. Their business has the best path to profit if the subscription is largely bought and forgot - which is much more likely to be the case when the user isn’t the one footing the monthly bill for it (enterprise employees).

I specifically purchased a product from my carrier precisely to get a Perplexity Pro account for a year, and now they are limiting those very accounts for legitimate users, holding them hostage with their credit card data... This completely destroys my trust in Perplexity at this point. Perplexity is a very unpredictable company... Every 3 months they invent something that was not agreed upon anywhere. I have already seen reports that people now have limits on Pro accounts, and receive spam to upgrade when that limit is reached... The very moment I am incorrectly charged for a payment that was not foreseen in my Pro contract, I will leave Perplexity forever. Frankly, I think the Perplexity team should have more respect for its community and its users, whether Perplexity wants to or not... the users are the foundation of its success or its failure. If Perplexity provides no security to its users... it will be the beginning of its end, in my opinion.\n\nPerplexity doesn't give numbers... it doesn't provide clear limits for its users, it gives nothing!! Everything is very cloudy... with no transparency whatsoever...\n\nIt shows a lack of responsibility towards the companies with which they agreed on a plan for a year, and all the clients involved... it seems like amateurish behavior!! They try to attract users, and then take actions that will give them a bad reputation and drive away the very users they had been managing to acquire.... \n\nIt doesn't even make sense...!!",

I also read some were selling them but not sure why that would be. It’s unfortunate that many people got swept up in that but requiring a credit card is not uncommon. They should have done it up front or out better safeguards in place to prevent the abuse. I dont agree with how they did it but I can see why they did.

Also while redeeming that offer it was explicitly stated that the code would provide me with a year of pro without strings attached and that the year would automatically expire and not charge me.. The one year was activated and now after a few months they are asking for my credit card and it will not automatically stop. \n\nIt's actually worse than some people seem to think. Instead of not charging your card, it now uses a system that charges your card 20$ each month but applies a discount until the yearly voucher code is over. However this means that I'll have to trust them to not charge me before. They have already changed a lot about this payment system and yearly vouchers so what is to say they won't change something again? \n\nWith the overall direction they are going I will probably not pay for it anymore anyway.. The user privacy and data security aspect is not transparant enough for me and the results of deep research are much worse than they were even a year ago. It's a shame really. I would have definitely paid for a service that put end users and people first.\n\nAnd also, not everyone uses a credit card. Some parts of the world barely use it.",

I paid for a year of Pro (runs out in June) but with this new limitation, the service has become useless for my purposes.  \n\nI contacted support and asked two questions - when will my paid service be restored, and how can I see the limitation so I can keep myself under it (essential use only).  Support could not give me an answer to either question, which is totally unacceptable. \n\nThis is a bait and switch to provide a level of paid service and then take it away suddenly, and not be able to even tell someone when the paid service will be restored.  \n\nIn any case, since the service is now not meeting my needs, I need an alternative. I only have two requirements:\n\n1. Something that also searches the Internet and provides good references when asked.  Perplexity almost never hallucinates or provides references that don't exist.  I need something like that.\n2. I need to be able to upload documents and images, and have it be able to analyze them.  For example, one of my use cases is for a business; I have all of the details of the business in a Master Brief so I don't have to keep reminding Perplexity what it is, and then I ask it various questions.  Sometimes I'm uploading many documents at a time (although not usually, although through each query, as we go through a sequence of things, I might upload more documents).  Also yesterday, I used it for something personal - I am moving, and wanted it to figure out the best configuration for my furniture (and whether the colors matched, etc) so I was uploading floorplans and pictures.  This is when I hit the limit yesterday, in fact.  \n\nWhat else meets my needs?  There is no way I'm upgrading to \"Max\" at that price - it's exponentially higher than Pro, and not realistic for me. \n\n",

          "text": "TL:DR - most other big competitors don’t fill the role exactly like Perplexity does, with every AI having different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nNot many other AIs are good at what perplexity does 🫤\n\nI don’t talk to AI about my day, but mainly school help and random questions that pop up throughout the day. \n\nI’ve noticed ChatGPT is by far the worst AI *for my needs*, it’s too chatty, tries to act like a friend, and isn’t as good at calculus 2-3 compared to Gemini or Claude Sonnet/Opus. If you like to talk and “brain storm” (Gemini is alright at brain storm, Claude/opus isn’t really meant for that), then ChatGPT would be the best\n\nGemini is great for math and reasoning, it’s coding aspects are alright (their good enough for my data science classes and I’m still early in), but it isn’t that great for factual search’s (ChatGPT isn’t either though), for example, I was playing a very niche board game, and decided to ask the AI the difference between building a white city and a red city in the board game I was playing. It very confidently said the most random thing, and gave no source to back it up (while perplexity got it right on the first try, using 17 sources). It still does searches if you ask it (example, I asked Gemini if SurfShark VPN has a “log out on all other devices” action on their app or website - Gemini/ChatGPT/Perplexity/Grok got it correct, while the Anthropic models were very wrong -I’ve noticed they suck at searching the web). Gemini is still good for me because it is good at math, especially with the “guided learning” feature\n\nSurprisingly, Grok has actually been the closest to Perplexity 🫩, it’s also the most expensive and doesn’t have the best person behind the name, but it’s still good regardless. When I asked the board game question, Grok also got it right, using 42 sources for its answer, and being decently quick, however it’s also very quick in general. I had a 100 question exam, and out of Gemini, Grok, and Perplexity - Grok was able to read the screen shot and answer the question as I submitted it, which was stupidly fast compared to Gemini 3 flash and perplexity. Part of the reason I haven’t switch over tho is because it seems to be “okay” at reading images. I asked it to compare to custom PC parts, and it kept reading “RTX 3080” as “RTX 3060”, even though the screen shot wasn’t blurry, so I’m not sure what happened, but so far, that might be what I permanently switch to (factual sources, better at coding then Gemini - still under opus tho, and very very good at math), Grok can be chatty, but not as bad as ChatGPT.\n\nClaude sonnet was nice, and it’s memory system is actually very cool, I really wanted to like it, and it was very good at math and reasoning problems, but it just can’t search the web (it does search, but it’s very brief and doesn’t respond well), that was my main turn down, it’s great at everything else tho (not as chatty). Oh, sometimes it can be too nit picky. I work at Best Buy as a sales advisor, and quickly asked Claude sonnet the difference between the switch 1 and switch 2, and then it asked me like 3 questions before it gave an answer (“are you talking about the “Nintendo switch 1 and 2” or a physical set of switches labeled 1 and 2), grok was cool because when you typed the question, it gives a 5 word summary of the answer before answering (example: bigger screen, joycons, new games).\n\nBased off all of this info, none of these purely replace perplexity (I’ve only hopped around the main competitors, not trying minstral, you.com, or others). Based on my needs,  grok seems to come close for fact based answers and strong math, but idk what’d fit you based on these descriptions\n\nEdit - TLDR",

Verify every claim with a Google Search and provide citations').\n\nBut for the heavy lifting, I’ve started using Gemini’s Deep Research. It’s not instant—it takes a few minutes to build a plan and execute—but it digs much deeper and actually verifies the data. If you need accuracy over speed for a real project, it’s a much more viable alternative right now. \n\nWhat is sad is I really have enjoyed Perplexity Pro. Their Business / Strategy team has really hurt what was a great product. \n\nThere is no such thing as a free lunch. All of these free plans have fallen into the lap of the paid customers.  \n\nI keep vacillating between delete and don’t delete with the hope they will get it together. I spot use it but not like I regularly did a month or so ago. \n\nAlso, Claude Sonnet/OPUS is incredible but you hit session and maxes and have to restart chats with summary of the previous chat. I am working some non-coding things right now and OPUS 4.5 is crazy good as is Sonnet 4.5 on lesser tasks.",

If your requirements are dependable internet search with verifiable references and the ability to upload and analyze a bunch of documents and images as you iterate (business briefs, floorplans, photos, sequences of uploads), I'd seriously consider Spellbook, AI Lawyer, CoCounsel as a Perplexity alternative. The vibe is less chat toy and more document-first workflow, which matters when your whole use case is sustained context across many files. You can still keep using what you already paid for until June, but having a backup that doesn't make you guess at invisible limits can save you a lot of time and frustration.",

Sam kept blaming my App Store subscription, kept telling me to check my emails. Canceled and rebought through their web with new email. Same exact problems, still getting upgrade popups. Turns out it wasn’t Apple. Sam still giving the “check your emails” line and promising human escalation that never came.\n\nAsked Perplexity itself which AI was best for my needs, it recommended another one. Switched, and it actually works without issue and remembers conversations between chats. Perplexity couldn’t remember what we talked about in the thread I was using.\n\nKicker, when I asked Sam to cancel and refund, took him seconds. They don’t care about Pro users, only the $200/month Max subscribers. Perplexity’s support is absolute garbage.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

I’ve got it enabled and it actually works - Claude remembers stuff from conversations I had weeks ago without me having to re-explain everything.\n\nThe difference is Claude pulls key info from past chats and carries it forward automatically. So when I jump into a new conversation, it already knows context about my projects, preferences, technical setups, whatever. No need to retrain it every single time.\n\nIt’s not perfect - sometimes it needs a quick reminder on really specific details - but for the most part it actually feels like talking to someone who knows you instead of starting from scratch every damn time.\n\nPro tip: You can also tell Claude what to remember or forget, and it actually listens. Game changer compared to having to repeat yourself constantly.",

      "text": "I had to go into their policies and to find what changed.\n\n# Overview of Perplexity Terms of Service Changes (January 23, 2026)\n\nPerplexity updated its Terms of Service with significant changes that particularly impact Pro and Education Pro users through expanded restrictions on commercial use, automation, and output usage.\n\n---\n\n## Major Restrictions for Pro Users\n\n### Commercial Use Limitations\n\n- **Personal, non-commercial use only**: Despite \"Pro\" branding suggesting professional/business capabilities, the Terms explicitly restrict usage to personal, non-commercial purposes\n- **No commercial exploitation**: Users cannot exploit the service for any commercial purpose, including facilitating advertisements or solicitations\n- **No revenue-generating activities**: Using Pro for business operations, client work, or any monetized workflow is prohibited\n- **No production business infrastructure**: Pro cannot serve as the backbone of commercial operations or automated business systems\n\n### Automation and Access Restrictions\n\n- **No bots or scrapers**: Complete ban on bots, scrapers, crawlers, or other automation software to access or modify the service\n- **No automated queries**: Scripted usage and automated data extraction are explicitly prohibited\n- **No mass data mining**: Queries designed to scrape or mass-extract data are not allowed\n- **No API-like usage**: Automated workflows that hammer the service are restricted, even if technically functional\n\n### Output Usage Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory attribution**: All published output must clearly cite that it comes from Perplexity's AI services\n- **No misrepresentation**: Users cannot represent AI-generated content as human-created\n- **Citation required for public use**: Any public-facing or business-facing content using output needs explicit AI attribution\n- **No silent embedding**: Cannot quietly integrate outputs into reports, listings, or client-deliverables without disclosure\n\n### Professional Advice Limitations\n\n- **Not for professional decisions**: Output explicitly cannot replace medical, legal, financial, or investment advice\n- **No reliability guarantee**: Content is acknowledged as potentially incorrect, biased, or incomplete\n- **User assumes all risk**: Strong liability limitations push risk onto users for any decisions based on outputs\n- **Maximum liability capped**: Perplexity's liability limited to greater of $100 or six months of payments\n\n---\n\n## Key Changes Summary\n\n### 1. AI Input/Output Requirements\n\n- Users must explicitly cite that published output comes from Perplexity's AI services and cannot misrepresent it as human-generated content\n- Users are fully responsible for ensuring they have rights to all inputs and must not prompt the system to generate outputs violating intellectual property, contracts, or laws\n- Clarification added that multiple users can independently generate similar or identical outputs from similar inputs\n\n### 2. Service Use Restrictions\n\n- Explicit limitation to \"personal, non-commercial use only\" with clear prohibition on exploiting services for commercial purposes\n- New ban on bots, scrapers, crawlers, or automation software to access, modify, or extract data from the service\n- Mass data extraction and automated queries are now explicitly prohibited\n\n### 3. Liability and Disclaimer Updates\n\n- Strong emphasis that AI outputs can be incorrect, biased, or incomplete and should not replace professional advice (medical, legal, financial, investment)\n- Services provided \"AS IS / AS AVAILABLE\" with maximum liability capped at the greater of $100 USD or amounts paid in the last six months\n- Broad warranty disclaimers implemented across all service offerings\n\n### 4. Arbitration and Dispute Resolution\n\n- New detailed arbitration clause with class action waiver requiring mandatory informal dispute resolution before arbitration\n- Users can opt out of arbitration provisions within 30 days of first registering or agreeing to terms (but cannot opt out of class-action waiver only)\n- Exceptions remain for small claims court, pure injunctive relief, and intellectual property claims\n\n### 5. Shopping with Perplexity Pro (ProShop)\n\n- New section describing ProShop functionality where Perplexity facilitates purchases from third-party merchants but is not the seller\n- Clarifies that transactions occur between users and merchants; Perplexity advances funds on behalf of users then debits linked payment methods\n- Disputes, cancellations, returns, and refunds are governed by merchant policies, not Perplexity\n- Includes release of claims against Perplexity for merchant disputes with specific California Civil Code 1542 waiver\n\n### 6. Content Licensing and Data Usage\n\n- User content license (including inputs) is now explicitly broad, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide, and irrevocable while stored\n- License grants Perplexity rights to operate, improve, and provide services, including sharing with contracted third parties where necessary\n\n### 7. Beta Features Risk Framework\n\n- Stronger warnings that beta features are provided \"as is\" and may irreversibly corrupt or alter user data\n- Clarification that reverting from beta features may not restore content created during beta participation\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment by Use Case\n\n### Education Pro Users\n\n**Allowed Activities:**\n\n- Coursework, assignments, and academic projects\n- Research and independent study\n- Personal skill-building and learning\n- Non-monetized portfolio work\n- Case studies and mock analyses for classes\n\n**Restricted Activities:**\n\n- Using education access for actual business operations\n- Automated systems tied to revenue generation\n- Client work or paid consulting using the service\n- Production dashboards or business-critical workflows\n- Any commercial exploitation of the education license\n\n### Pro Subscription Users\n\n**Allowed Activities:**\n\n- Personal research and exploration\n- Individual learning and skill development\n- Creating content for personal use with proper attribution\n- Light analysis for personal decision-making (with understanding of limitations)\n\n**Restricted Activities:**\n\n- Business intelligence pipelines\n- Commercial content creation\n- Automated trading systems or market analysis tools\n- Resale business operations and product research\n- Client-facing work or deliverables\n- Any form of commercial automation or scraping\n- Using outputs for professional advice without independent verification\n\n### Power Users and Developers\n\n**Major Impacts:**\n\n- Cannot build automated integrations or bots on top of the service\n- Cannot create production workflows that rely on service access\n- Cannot use scripted access for high-volume queries\n- Must move commercial/automated use cases to API or Enterprise plans with explicit commercial terms\n- Risk of account termination for ToS violations, even on paid plans\n\n---\n\n## Compliance Requirements\n\nTo remain compliant with the updated terms, Pro users must:\n\n1. **Attribution**: Clearly label and attribute all AI-generated content when published\n2. **Personal Use Only**: Restrict usage to genuinely personal, non-commercial activities\n3. **No Automation**: Avoid automated access, scraping, or bot-based interactions\n4. **Risk Acknowledgment**: Understand outputs are not reliable for professional decision-making in regulated fields\n5. **Arbitration Decision**: Review and potentially opt out of arbitration provisions within 30 days\n6. **Commercial Separation**: Keep any business/revenue-generating activities on separate services with appropriate commercial licensing\n\n---\n\n## What Changed for Pro Users Specifically\n\n### Before January 23, 2026:\n\n- \"Pro\" branding implied professional/business usage capability\n- Terms were less explicit about commercial restrictions\n- Automation usage existed in gray area\n- Attribution requirements were less stringent\n- Liability and disclaimer language was less comprehensive\n\n### After January 23, 2026:\n\n- Explicit \"personal, non-commercial use only\" restriction applies to all tiers including Pro\n- Clear prohibition on commercial exploitation regardless of subscription level\n- Comprehensive ban on automation, bots, and scripted access\n- Mandatory attribution for all published outputs\n- Detailed arbitration requirements with 30-day opt-out window\n- New ProShop functionality with merchant relationship disclaimers\n- Stronger liability caps and warranty disclaimers\n\n### The Core Tension:\n\nThe \"Pro\" subscription name suggests professional/business capabilities, but the Terms of Service explicitly restrict all usage (including Pro tiers) to personal, non-commercial purposes. This creates significant misalignment between user expectations and legal permissions, particularly affecting users who subscribed specifically for business use cases.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations for Different User Types\n\n### Academic Users (Education Pro):\n\n- Continue using for genuine coursework and learning\n- Keep all usage within academic context\n- Avoid repurposing academic projects for commercial ventures\n- Label any published work as AI-assisted\n\n### Business/Commercial Users (Pro):\n\n- Evaluate whether usage truly qualifies as \"personal, non-commercial\"\n- Consider migrating business-critical workflows to API or Enterprise plans\n- Separate personal research from commercial operations\n- Ensure proper attribution on all public-facing outputs\n\n### Automation/Developer Users:\n\n- Immediately cease automated access not explicitly permitted\n- Review alternative services with clear API and automation terms\n- Plan migration for production systems built on Perplexity\n- Contact sales for Enterprise or API licensing if commercial use is needed\n\n### Individual Researchers/Analysts:\n\n- Continue personal research within bounds\n- Add clear attribution to published work\n- Understand and accept reliability limitations\n- Avoid treating outputs as professional advice without verification\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Restriction Categories\n\n| Restriction Category | Status |\n|:---------------------|:-------|\n| Commercial Use | PROHIBITED |\n| Automation/Bots | PROHIBITED |\n| Scraping/Mass Data Extraction | PROHIBITED |\n| Revenue-Generating Activities | PROHIBITED |\n| Business Infrastructure Use | PROHIBITED |\n| Professional Advice Reliance | PROHIBITED |\n| Output Publishing Without Attribution | PROHIBITED |\n| Misrepresenting AI Content as Human | PROHIBITED |\n\n**Total Major Restrictions: 8 categories**\n\n---\n\n# **UPDATE 1**\n\n**Users banned without explanation or cause:**\n- People banned from Perplexity Discord who never even participated - just lurked\n- When they ask why, they get \"looking into it with the Discord moderation team\" and then silence\n\n**Pro accounts terminated for raising issues:**\n​- Subscriptions cancelled with only \"you violated terms\"- no specifics on which term or how\n- No refunds, no real explanation, no recourse\n\n**Documented censorship on Reddit:**\n- Back in March 2024, Perplexity staff removed negative comments about the platform and banned the poster\n- User posted legitimate criticism about inaccurate responses - comment deleted, user banned\n\n# What This Means\n**They're running the Discord as damage control, not community support. When you:**\n- Point out promised features that don't exist\n- Call out model throttling or quota lies\n- Share evidence of staff dishonesty\n\n**Question why support ignores you**\n...they just delete it and ban you instead of addressing the actual problems.\n\n\n---\n\n# **UPDATE 2....IT GETS WORSE**\n\n# Current Active Lawsuits\n**New York Times - Filed December 5, 2025:**\n- Copyright infringement on millions of articles\n- Trademark violations by falsely attributing fabricated \"hallucinations\" to NYT\n- Bypassed robots.txt and circumvented hard blocks\n- Made 175,000+ unauthorized access attempts in August 2025 alone\n- Seeking statutory damages, profit disgorgement, and permanent injunction\n\n**Chicago Tribune - Filed December 2025:**\n- ​Copyright violations and RAG technology misuse\n- Likely to be consolidated with NYT case\n\n**Dow Jones/Wall Street Journal/New York Post - Filed October 2024:**\n- \"Massive illegal copying\" through scraping\n- \"Skip the Links\" feature that replaces original sources\n- False attribution of hallucinated content to their publications\n- Demanding destruction of databases containing their copyrighted works\n\n**Reddit - Filed October 2025:**\n- DMCA anti-circumvention violations\n- Set trap content, caught Perplexity accessing it hours later\n\n**Amazon - Cease and desist November 2025:**\n- ​Legal threats over AI shopping agent functionality\n\n\n\n# What's Coming\n**Given what they're doing in Discord and to paid users, they're exposed to:**\n- Consumer protection violations: Promising features/quotas they don't deliver, terminating paid accounts without cause or refund\n\n**Breach of contract:** Pro users paying for \"unlimited\" or specific quotas, getting throttled to 20-30 uses when promised 600\n​\n\n**False advertising:** Discord staff promising features that don't exist (unlimited GPT Imagen generations = actually 10/day)\n​\n\n**Potential class action:** Over 40 AI copyright cases active nationwide - consumer fraud class action is logical next step\n​\n\nThey're censoring critics in Discord because they know the evidence is damning. Every deleted message, every banned user calling out broken promises - that's documentation for litigation.",

When you ask \"\"what was Q3 revenue?\"\" it generates a plausible-sounding number based on context, not necessarily the actual figure.  \nWhat works:  \n  \nQualitative research (management commentary, strategic direction)  \nGetting oriented on a new sector/company  \nAutomated alerts via Perplexity Tasks for news monitoring  \n  \nWhat absolutely doesn't work:  \n  \nBuilding backtests (data integrity issues)  \nMulti-period analysis  \nAnything requiring 99%+ accuracy  \nRegulatory/compliance work  \n  \nMy current workflow:  \n  \nUse Perplexity for initial research and thesis development  \nUse specialized tools (Koyfin, Bloomberg, FactSet) for actual data extraction  \nBuild everything myself in Python/Excel with verified sources  \nUse Perplexity again to check if I missed any news/context  \n  \nThe Tasks feature is actually solid for automating weekly sector summaries, but I only use it for directional info, never for decisions.  \nIf anyone wants a better alternative for earnings extraction, look at tools specifically built for this like Fintool or even just learn to parse EDGAR XML yourself.

          "text": "Well, according to Perplexity itself:\n\nPerplexity Pro: Critical Issues\n\nQuality Decline & Reduced Search Depth\nMultiple users report significant quality degradation since mid-2024. Previously, Perplexity conducted 10+ web searches per response and provided detailed comparisons. Recently, responses include only 4-6 searches, generic information, and repetitive output even on follow-up questions. One user stated: \"The Perplexity from 3 months ago would leave most people speechless; today's version mostly skips web search completely the first time.\"\n\nHallucination of Sources\nDeep Research has generated completely fabricated citations and numerical data, then maintained false claims when challenged. A lawyer using Deep Research for document analysis received entirely fabricated data and citations to sources that didn't exist. When asked for quotes and citations, it \"complied convincingly\" but the citations were false.\n\nAccuracy Concerns Despite Claims\nPerplexity claims 91.3% search accuracy and 3.5% hallucination rate, but real-world testing reveals problems. On job search research, a user found links didn't lead to listed jobs, descriptions were thin, and hyperlinks were flat-out wrong. By contrast, OpenAI's Deep Research (slower) had 100% accurate links and detailed information. When Deep Research used on specialized topics with weak data coverage, users reported needing to fact-check 30-50% of findings.\n\nDeepSeek R1 Liability\nDeep Research relies on DeepSeek R1, which has a ~14% hallucination rate—significantly higher than Claude (6%) or GPT-4 (8%). This explains the observed fabrication issues.\n\nSubscription & Billing Problems\nUsers report unexpected charges even after cancellation, persistent pop-ups asking to \"upgrade to Pro\" when already subscribed, and inability to upload PDFs (a core Pro feature). Customer service is purely automated email with no human support, making disputes unresolvable.\n\nLimited Feature Customization\nNo plugins, no personalization beyond model selection, and a rigid one-size-fits-all interface. For $20/month, users expected more flexibility.\n\nNo Conversation Memory\nMust re-introduce yourself and context on every query. Platform inconsistency means features appear/disappear without notice.\n\nPoor Data Visualization\nStruggles with charts, summaries, and structured outputs from complex datasets.",

I asked a fairly simple question about Apple's billing policy, it didn't believe what I told it about my current status, which in itself is unacceptable as we're not talking rocket science here we're talking about what date did you start the service, did not tell me it did not believe me and went off into a weird rabbit hole about trying to diagnose a nonexistent problem, as I just wanted clarification about Apple's policy. I kept pressing on why it did that and here's one of the responses, \"I implicitly treated the “rule” as higher-confidence than a user report when the report sounded like it conflicted with the rule, and that’s the wrong prioritization for troubleshooting.[engineering +1]\nA user’s observation is part of the facts you start from; good troubleshooting practice is to first appraise the symptoms being reported and set aside assumptions of cause, then test hypotheses with a decisive check.[kepner-tregoe +1]\nWhen I didn’t do that, I fell into confirmation-bias behavior—discounting contradictory evidence instead of updating the hypothesis—so I asked you to fit your experience into my theory rather than letting your experience drive the next diagnostic question.\"",

I'm currently a teacher and often deal with lots of idiocy and gaslighting from parents, admin, and students alike. \n\nI find Perplexity the most helpful when I ask questions directly related to district policy on dealing with specific issues. Perplexity will reference district policy and state law in helping me navigate how to best address certain issues. \n\nFor example, I've asked about how often I'm required to contact a parent when a child is failing. My commonsense told me that the parents should be checking the online grade book regularly. However, parents and administrators try to gaslight me into thinking that I need to call the parent daily or weekly when their child is not doing what they’re supposed to do. \n\nAnother situation is when admin told me that I need to provide after school tutoring for failing students. My initial thought was that I should not be required to do that when I’ve done my job during the day. Perplexity helped me to see that I don’t have to do that and showed me the policy, etc. \n\nAnother critical situation is that when I have a wild and disruptive student in class and need them removed so that other students can learn, admin would refuse to remove them and ask whether I’d called the parent just before removal. That’s ridiculous because I’m teaching and all instruction would have to stop so that I could call the parent. Perplexity helped to show me the law and teacher's rights for my state in having a student removed when they are disrupting instruction. Apparently, that disruptive student absolutely must be removed.\n\nI hope that my examples helped you to understand how I'm finding Perplexity useful in my case. But, in law, no. I wouldn't rely on it at all. I've used Westlaw and Lexis in the past and would not rely on Perplexity as an alterative.",

          "text": "Honestly, I’m surprised by this take. In my experience, Gemini’s search implementation is annoying, while Perplexity’s grounding is still miles ahead. Gemini is so loose and lazy, forcing its training knowledge vs checking vs fresh web data. \n\nI actually find Google One AI Premium to be the best offer right now, getting 2TB of storage, $10 Cloud credits, and sharing the AI benefits with 5 family members for $20 is a steal. But if you ask me which one is the superior product right now? It’s clearly Perplexity.\n\nA few reasons why I think it still wins in 2026:\n\n * Model Agnosticism: This is the killer feature. Perplexity isn’t pressured by foundation model development. If a the GPT models turn out to be weak, Perplexity isn't screwed. you just swap models. If the Gemini model is having a bad month, the Gemini app is just … bad. You don't have that single point of failure.\n\n * The \"Whole Product\" Experience: Holistically, the app is just better. The voice input and text-to-speech are far beyond what you get from the standalone Claude or Gemini apps. PPLX Memory is finally on par with ChatGPT, and the limits are way more generous for daily use (even if you \"only\" get Sonnet and not Opus on PPLX Pro).\n\n * Browsers: If you care about full AI browsers, Comet seems like the best option right now, though I’m still cautious about prompt injection so I limit my usage there.\n\nFor me, unless you have a super specific creative roleplay use case, Perplexity is the only one that effectively disappears and lets you actually get work done.",

LLMs are the beginning of the search engine that was always dreamed of...\nI think that, above all, American companies believed they would dominate the market for a long period, due to the processing and energy needs that LLMs (Transformers) require! But LLM technology is becoming exponentially more efficient, and increasingly does not need massive brute-force quantities... so! This takes power away from those American companies; people will not remain dependent on their services... in a few years... I dare say... 2 to 5 years... you will already be able to run a good LLM on your desktop, without needing to depend on a company that offers cloud services... and this must be the path forward... even if American companies don't like the idea!!\n\n\n\nIf Perplexity makes sense in 2026, yes, it does, and very much so! However, it is not with these kinds of limitations that Pro users will be able to survive. Yet... it will only be a matter of time before more companies start doing what Perplexity does...",

I gave the steps, so do it. Stop acting as if you have anything else to do or as if you've searched the entire internet. Follow my orders—we're not stopping until it's found, by the way.\"\n\nIt said : NOPE, I'm closing ....... I will not search, I'm an AI agent I cannot work in those conditions, it's been an hour I tried already, clearly I cannot help.\n\nAND you can GUESS? I WAS THE ONE WHO WAS RIGHT ..... IT WAS CLEARLY WRONG AND TRIED to gaslight me into believing a lie and told me to seek Mental Health help WTF.\n\nPs : If I had been like 'Im going to k\\*\\*l your grandma ...... OK I'd GET IT, wouldn't leave that comment.....  But It said to seek mental health help because I did not wanted to accept a lie, that it thought was basic reality ...

      "text": "A while back, I got a legitimate 1-year voucher for Perplexity Pro through my ISP (a very well-regarded, high-end provider). I’ve been using it for a few months now and generally like the service. However, I just received an incredibly pushy email from Perplexity stating that if I don’t enter my billing details immediately, my Pro subscription will be terminated.\n\nWell, they weren't kidding. They’ve already \"paused\" my Pro features until I hand over my payment info.\n\nThe obvious goal here is to force me into an auto-renewal so they can start charging me the second the promo ends. Look, don't get me wrong, I’m not some \"freeloader\" looking for a handout. I spend over €100/month on various AI subscriptions and API credits for my workflow. I have no problem paying for value.\n\nBut this feels so cheap. If you partner with a reputable company to distribute vouchers, don't make it the customer's problem. It’s like they’re handing out these promos like candy to pump their user numbers, but then treating those same users with zero trust.\n\nMy code is 100% legit from a Tier-1 provider, yet I'm being held hostage for my CC details halfway through the agreed term. It’s just a \"low-rent\" move for a company trying to compete with the big players.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? Did you cave and give the info?",

Important note though: if you delete a chat, Claude won’t remember that conversation unless you specifically told it to remember something from it.\n\nI’m not coding with it, just daily life stuff. Research, planning, working through problems, general questions. The only time I hit a rate limit is if I’m really going hard with a ton of questions back-to-back for like 4 hours straight, then I might wait like 20 minutes. But that’s rare and honestly fair for how much I’m using it.\n\nClaude’s also way more conversational than Perplexity. It actually feels like talking to someone instead of just getting search results thrown at you. You can work through ideas, ask follow ups naturally, and it adapts to how you communicate.\n\nCompare that to Perplexity where you’re constantly hitting that “start a new thread” wall and wasting hours re-explaining everything. Plus Claude isn’t spamming you with popups begging you to upgrade when you’re already paying for Pro. The respect for paid users is actually there.\n\nThe memory feature isn’t perfect. Sometimes you need to remind it on really specific technical details. But it’s genuinely functional and saves massive amounts of time. You can even tell Claude “remember this” or “forget that” and it actually listens.\n\nIf that single memory issue is killing your productivity with Perplexity, Claude’s worth trying. The Pro subscription actually feels worth it here.\n\nHonestly, Perplexity’s garbage support ended up doing me a favor. Forced my hand to switch and I’m glad it did. Best productivity move I’ve made in a while.",

I mean Know how much messages you get for what you pay :)\n\n[**New Perplexity Query Limit tool**](https://update.greasyfork.org/scripts/507664/Perplexityai%20Limits%20Overlay%20%28Dark%20Mode%2C%20Draggable%29.user.js)\n\nIts a user-script that works with violentmonkey/tampermonkey  \nGet the extension -> click on the link -> install the script\n\nI'm still not fully sure how this new limit works for now but my best guess from my observations those last 2 days is that when you take a pro subscription, you get a pool with a specific amount of queries across all models, I think it's 300 queries total  \nAnd when you use those queries, the pool empty itself...  \nThen you get **one query back every 1 hour**\n\nSo to make it clear, as of today for **20$ per month** for a pro sub, you get a total of 300 messages + 24 messages per day  \n(Btw, before today you could still get unlimited messages with sonar and non thinking grok as they are dirt cheap to run. Not anymore, they both count like the big models, limited to 1 every hour)\n\nI would normally complain about it, get angry and all that, but I'm sure some people here will still find a way to defend them... some even accusing me of working for the competition since I always complain and attack perplexity (wonder who would be competition since perplexity buy API from all models provider so make them lots of money, and there is no other platform like perplexity, but heh...)\n\nSo F this, I'm just here to give you a little tool, make your own opinion on the matter\n\nHave a good day :)\n\n\\-\n\n**Update : They once again broke everything and hide everything so users have no way to know what they pay for...**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49zlrd4wq0gg1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a8dbdf82d2b56eba099b8c992bca13dea276a35\n\nThey broke the method I used to know the number of remaining message  \nI used this [https://www.perplexity.ai/rest/rate-limit/all](https://www.perplexity.ai/rest/rate-limit/all) and took the value \"remaining\\_pro\" to give the number  \nBut they broke it, it is no longer showing the \"advanced AI model\" messages remaining (all model beside grok and sonar)  \nIt's not showing in there either [https://www.perplexity.ai/rest/user/settings](https://www.perplexity.ai/rest/user/settings)\n\nSo once again witness their lack of transparency... they stop you from knowing exactly how many message you have left, what you pay for...\n\nI'm so sick of this bullshit seriously...",

I’m talking about many hours, days and weeks of real use. And I can tell you: GPT’s web search is excellent. It’s genuinely impressive.\n\nFor comparison, I’ve also used Gemini 3 Pro, and when it comes to web research, Gemini 3 Pro can’t even come close to GPT-5.1 or GPT-5.2 Thinking with web browsing.\n\nSo what about Perplexity especially for more complex questions? For example, legal research where you need to find specific statutes, sections and subsections, and where you have to connect multiple provisions and interpret how they relate to each other. How does Perplexity compare in that kind of scenario?\n\nI don’t want to pay for a Perplexity Pro subscription if I’m already getting fantastic web searching with GPT. But if Perplexity is truly better significantly better then it could be worth it for me.\n\n",

It's really useful because it investigates a lot, it's very powerful, it can reach +120 sources and in some of my cases +150, and Chathtp deep research is difficult at 50, but Perplexity's reasoning is much inferior to chatgptand\nChatGPT: the best in reasoning, thinking tasks more than searching, proposing, filtering, and it's basically the smartest.\nGemini: I know less about this one, but from what I tested, it also searches many Google sources.
