With only 20 Deep Research runs per month, I now feel significant **rate-limit anxiety**, similar to what I experienced with ChatGPT.\n\nIdeally, I’d love to see both options available: the new Opus 4.5-based Deep Research for high-stakes work, and the older version (I believe based on a custom DeepSeek R1) for everyday research, with a more generous daily cap, say at least **20-30 per day**.\n\nPreviously, the limit was high enough that I never had to worry about it in practice, which was great.",

I split the test into two phases:\n\n * Phase 1 (Standard): I asked the question directly without any additional instructions.\n\n * Phase 2 (Prompt Engineering): I used specific instructions telling the AI to think much more deeply, utilize a significantly higher number of sources, and prioritize these new instructions over all else.\n\nThe Results\n\n| Feature | Standard Response | Engineered Prompt |\n|---|---|---|\n| Length | Normal (a few paragraphs) | Much longer (multiple sections) |\n| Source Count | 11 sources | 18 sources |\n| Quality | Good, standard output | Exhaustive and deep |\n\n\nMy Conclusion\n\nI’ve concluded that by spending a little more time on prompt design, I can develop a \"template\" to use as a prefix for any question requiring deep research.\nWhile it is certainly less convenient than a \"one-click\" deep search button, but it work.",

If the result wasn’t great, I could refine my prompt and run it again without worrying about quotas. The generous daily allowance made it feel much more exploratory and natural to use and I miss that.",

I used the previous “lightweight Deep Research” for topics I wanted to explore more deeply, but without spending my limited 20 ChatGPT Deep Research credits per month. Perplexity’s lightweight version was faster and effectively unlimited, which made it ideal for “medium-depth” research - deeper than thinking models, but much quicker than ChatGPT’s full Deep Research that can run for 10–15 minutes. It would be great to have access to these fast deepish searches even before I’ve used up my monthly Perplexity Opus Deep Research quota.",

In order to update the text inside the app, they have to submit an app update to Apple and wait for it to be approved.\n\nThe new advanced deep research is powered by Opus 4.5, so it costs a considerable amount of more money to run than the previous Deep Research, which I believe was run via a Chinese OSS model.\n\nI believe that once you exhaust the advanced research quota it falls back to the previous version of Research.\n\nBut this is very confusing, Perplexity should have just waited for a chance to be able to push an app update before pushing the new Advanced research.",

Today, I returned to Codex High, worked intensively on my application all evening, and my limits were not exhausted, there were about 20 heavy requests. There is no point in using a Claude Code subscription for less than $100 per month, which is why there are such restrictions on Perplexity. But 20 requests is ridiculous in any case.",

But if there is a monthly limit now I would not blame people for canceling their subscriptions. Maybe they use research lite which uses Sonar by default and you get 20 normal research or maybe research advanced prompts per month also if they set a very strict limit on the number of searches a day, users will not be able to use, as their primary web browser anymore because normal web searches would be perplexity searches and quickly exhaust their quota.",

With only 20 Deep Research runs per month, I now feel significant rate-limit anxiety, similar to what I experienced with ChatGPT.\n\nIdeally, I’d love to see both options available: the new Opus 4.5-based Deep Research for high-stakes work, and the older version (I believe based on a custom DeepSeek R1) for everyday research, with a more generous daily cap, say **20-30 per day** instead of the former \\~200.",

Sure, ChatGPT might offer the same for their plus tier but they offer higher context window with GPT5.2 thinking and 3000 queries per week for that. They offer many more features that Perplexity tried to imitate and doesn’t do as well. \n\nRight now it seems like Gemini AI pro is the best option in the mid tier subscriptions due to the context window, usage limits, the 2TB of cloud storage, and giving you 25 deep research queries per day. Googles web indexing is unmatched and they have improved their deep research rapidly that it’s even better than Perplexity pro imo. \n\nPerplexity at its core is a search engine but with a chatbot and nice UI. Its search first and Chabot second. \n\nThis is so shady and manipulative from them. And they’re to blame for it all cuz they gave away free annual promotions and subscriptions left and right like it’s candy. And they did this just to increase their user base and market cap. \n\nThey won’t survive another 2 years if they continue like this. And they tried to imitate ChatGPT and Gemini with all the features they added in the past 6 months. But disregard and neglected wha made them different and better in the first pace: their web search and deep research. \n\nPro feels like the new free tier and Max is like what pro was exactly a year ago. \n\n$200USD/month just doesn’t justify the Max tier in any shape or form since again, the long memory sucks, context window is 32K and nothing changed but more usage limits. You really get nothing. \n\nAt this point having ChatGPT plus, Gemini AI Pro, and Claude Max (the $100 one) is a much better stack and deal.",

So I used them as if they were unlimited. \"I paid for the speedometer I am going to use the speedometer.\" My fault for abusing the tool? Probably. \n\nBut is it Perplexity's fault for selling me the ability to burn 2 of their dollars every time I wanted a deep research on recent drama and allowing me to do it over a hundred times when I only spent 200 bucks a year? Yeah that's their problem. If it is genuinely unsustainable to the point they need to bring it down by 98% in just ONE YEAR, maybe that's their fault.\n\nIf what they sold isn't possible... why am I in the wrong for using what was offered and getting upset when it's reduced by 98% without communication?",

The organization later became CSI (Committee for Skeptical Inquiry) in 2006.​\n\nThe geometric design represents this influential skeptical organization that brought together scientists, magicians, and researchers to counter uncritical acceptance of pseudoscience. The Reddit post you linked suggests the design resembles Perplexity's current asterisk logo, though Perplexity's was independently designed in 2023 by Smith & Diction to represent doorways into knowledge sources",

The image you shared appears to show a panel discussion (likely from decades ago) with a geometric logo on the wall that resembles Perplexity’s current branding, sparking online speculation.\nPerplexity’s Logo Origin\nPerplexity’s logo was designed by Philadelphia-based branding agency Smith & Diction in 2023. According to the designers, the logo intentionally combines several symbolic elements:[ebaqdesign +2]\n•\tComputer cursor – representing digital access and the typing experience\n•\tAsterisk – referencing how Perplexity cites all its sources\n•\tOpen book – symbolizing knowledge\n•\tRevolving doors/windows – representing multiple perspectives and the internet\nThe design team described it as capturing “the idea that whatever you type into Perplexity seamlessly transforms into an answer”.[instagram]\nWhy the Similarity Exists\nGeometric logos built from intersecting lines forming star or asterisk shapes are extremely common in design history—universities, corporations, and organizations have used similar motifs for decades. The building in your photo appears to display such a logo, but this doesn’t indicate copying. Smith & Diction documented their design process publicly, showing how they evolved the concept from a blinking cursor to the final asterisk-inspired icon.[linkedin]\nWhile Perplexity has faced various lawsuits over content (from The New York Times, Encyclopedia Britannica, and Reddit), none involve allegations of logo theft. The visual resemblance to older logos is likely coincidental given how ubiquitous this geometric style has been throughout design history.[nytimes +1]",

This is not about users signing up for legitimate, public-facing offers like the PayPal or SheerID one-year free trials.\n\nThe Teardown\n\n> Perplexity gave out promotions to everyone and their grandma.\n\nThere is a massive legal and ethical chasm between a company running a public marketing campaign and a group of users exploiting a leaked administrative bypass. \"Grandma\" getting a public discount doesn't justify you using a backdoor meant for developers or internal testing.\n\n> What people are doing (if so at a large scale) is not right but knowing the amount of users that have violated this would help justify the amount of effort going for the users.\n\nScaling a violation doesn’t turn it into a virtue. This is the \"everyone else is doing it\" fallacy; the number of people exploiting a leak doesn't \"justify\" the effort, it just creates a larger mess for the engineers to clean up.\n\n> Their platform seems so damn stale and could use a few minor touches to make it so damn good.\n\nIf the platform is \"stale,\" it is incredibly contradictory to go through the mental gymnastics of exploiting leaked codes to get it for free. If the product isn't worth the money, the logical response is to use a competitor, not to commit a Terms of Service violation to access something you claim to dislike.\n\n> Granted, I recommended a lot of suggestions to their team and they never provide feedback of reasoning or anything besides stupid Sam bot.\n\nNot getting a personalized \"thank you\" note for your feature requests does not grant you a license to circumvent a company’s billing system. Bad customer service is a reason to take your business elsewhere, not a voucher for digital shoplifting.\n\n> Also, they're scummy af knowing the amount of lawsuits they're in with large organizations for scraping data, which they do themselves.\n\nA company’s legal disputes regarding data scraping—which is a complex industry-wide debate—is not a \"get out of jail free\" card for individual users to violate their user agreement. Using a company's perceived \"scummy\" behavior to justify your own exploitation is peak moral equivalence.\n\n> Along with the sleezy actions of degrading Pro users access without notifying users. They upgraded most of their documentation to cover up areas where it was showing the services they promised.\n\nIf you believe a company is in breach of contract, the appropriate remedy is a refund, a credit card chargeback, or a cancellation. Responding to a \"breach of contract\" by exploiting a leaked internal code is not a remedy; it’s just another violation that kills your standing as a \"wronged\" customer.\n\n> They breached their contract with Pro users and the amount of users is substantial. It appears to be a continuous behavior by Perplexity of unethical leadership.\n\nIf you truly believe the leadership is unethical and the contract is broken, the most impactful protest is to stop using the service entirely. Continuing to use the product while bypassing the paywall suggests you actually find the tool quite valuable, despite the moral posturing.\n\n> Imagine being an employee and knowing your employer was doing this type of shady business.\n\nImagine being a developer working late to fix bugs and improve features, only to watch a segment of the \"community\" leak internal administrative overrides to avoid paying for the very work you're doing.",

It is what it is, but I think the bullshit elitist attitude is ridiculous. \n\nYou got your access via the intended, preferred path. Good for you. I am glad that you found value in the platform so much that you continue to use it as a paying consumer. And I hope that Perplexity continues to treat your patronage with the respect it deserves because you pay them to be the tool/service/platform that serves your needs.\n\nMy issue with the way Perplexity has handled this matter on 2 fronts. The first is their \"scorched earth\" tactic; they suspended accounts, valid as well as invalid. They contributed to this problem, & they inconvenienced & punished accounts that they themselves gave via promotions with other parties. That is lazy & terrible customer service. The legit accounts did not deserve that kind of treatment.\n\nThe second reason ties directly to the title of the post. The reason given is a vague violation of the Terms of Service. And yes, I read them. At the time (prior to the most recent version dated January 2026), there was no language about the promotions or codes being sold, shared, or anything of that sort. As such, Perplexity simply failed to account for such a thing happening at all, let alone at scale, within their Terms. That entire section is new (I believe the update prior to January was last July) which I am sure is due to everything that has happened.\n\nWhile the notice I received presented a way to reach out if it was believed that the suspension was in error, the response stated that the decision was final with no way to review any further. The main crux, however, was the lack of reason given. I asked repeatedly for the explicit violation that went against the Terms; nothing was given. It makes the whole process seem arbitrary rather than deliberately calculated which it should be. If rules are broken, then state the violation. The problem with that? Until late January of this year, there was nothing that spoke to the way accounts were being activated.\n\nThis is not me complaining about my account being downgraded from Pro; I accept that fully as somewhat inevitable. I just resent it being done arbitrarily & impacting accounts that did not warrant that treatment. And I resent users turning their noses up at other users who didn't necessarily do things right. You don't know their circumstances or reasons, not that it justifies what they did or how they did it. If you downvote, downvote. I'm not here for your approval; I'm here to add a different perspective to the discussion. And that perspective is that companies need to be as accountable for the exploitation of their guidelines as the consumers.",

Good for you.\"\n\nFollowing the intended path isn’t elitism; it’s the basic social contract of commerce. When you pay for a service instead of using a leaked internal code, you aren’t being an \"elitist\"—you are being a customer. Bypassing the checkout line because you think the price is too high isn't a \"perspective,\" it’s theft of services.\n\n\\> \"Perplexity simply failed to account for such a thing happening at all, let alone at scale, within their Terms.\"\n\nThis is pure entitlement. A grocery store doesn't need a sign specifically saying \"Don't use a photocopied coupon you found in a dumpster\" for you to know it’s wrong. Theft of services is covered under general unauthorized access. You don’t need a specific clause to know that buying a subscription from a \"shady guy on Discord\" is a violation of the service agreement.\n\n\\> \"The response stated that the decision was final with no way to review any further... It makes the whole process seem arbitrary.\"\n\nThere is nothing arbitrary about it. They identified accounts activated via fraud and closed them. Companies are not obligated to provide a multi-step appeals process for people who didn't actually pay them. If you didn't buy the product from the vendor, you aren't a \"customer\"—you are a trespasser on their infrastructure.\n\n\\> \"I just resent it being done arbitrarily... And I resent users turning their noses up at other users who didn't necessarily do things right.\"\n\nPeople \"turn their noses up\" because exploitation increases costs for everyone else. When people abuse promo codes, it forces companies to kill legitimate promotions and raise prices for the people actually paying the bills. You aren't being judged for your \"circumstances\"; you are being called out for the entitlement of feeling you deserve a premium AI tool without compensating the people who build it.\n\n\\> \"Companies need to be as accountable for the exploitation of their guidelines as the consumers.\"\n\nThe company is being accountable—to its developers and paying users—by shutting down theft. Accountability means facing the consequences of your actions. If you use a leaked code, you lose the account. That is the system working exactly as it should.",

Why people use stolen codes and then publicly complain they got caught is beyond me.

I specifically purchased a product from my carrier precisely to get a Perplexity Pro account for a year, and now they are limiting those very accounts for legitimate users, holding them hostage with their credit card data... This completely destroys my trust in Perplexity at this point. Perplexity is a very unpredictable company... Every 3 months they invent something that was not agreed upon anywhere. I have already seen reports that people now have limits on Pro accounts, and receive spam to upgrade when that limit is reached... The very moment I am incorrectly charged for a payment that was not foreseen in my Pro contract, I will leave Perplexity forever. Frankly, I think the Perplexity team should have more respect for its community and its users, whether Perplexity wants to or not... the users are the foundation of its success or its failure. If Perplexity provides no security to its users... it will be the beginning of its end, in my opinion.\n\nPerplexity doesn't give numbers... it doesn't provide clear limits for its users, it gives nothing!! Everything is very cloudy... with no transparency whatsoever...\n\nIt shows a lack of responsibility towards the companies with which they agreed on a plan for a year, and all the clients involved... it seems like amateurish behavior!! They try to attract users, and then take actions that will give them a bad reputation and drive away the very users they had been managing to acquire.... \n\nIt doesn't even make sense...!!",

I also read some were selling them but not sure why that would be. It’s unfortunate that many people got swept up in that but requiring a credit card is not uncommon. They should have done it up front or out better safeguards in place to prevent the abuse. I dont agree with how they did it but I can see why they did. Im curious how much was lost from those fraudulent accounts.",

The one year was activated and now after a few months they are asking for my credit card and it will not automatically stop. \n\nIt's actually worse than some people seem to think. Instead of not charging your card, it now uses a system that charges your card 20$ each month but applies a discount until the yearly voucher code is over. However this means that I'll have to trust them to not charge me before. They have already changed a lot about this payment system and yearly vouchers so what is to say they won't change something again? \n\nWith the overall direction they are going I will probably not pay for it anymore anyway.. The user privacy and data security aspect is not transparant enough for me and the results of deep research are much worse than they were even a year ago. It's a shame really. I would have definitely paid for a service that put end users and people first.\n\nAnd also, not everyone uses a credit card. Some parts of the world barely use it.",

          "text": "Well, according to Perplexity itself:\n\nPerplexity Pro: Critical Issues\n\nQuality Decline & Reduced Search Depth\nMultiple users report significant quality degradation since mid-2024. Previously, Perplexity conducted 10+ web searches per response and provided detailed comparisons. Recently, responses include only 4-6 searches, generic information, and repetitive output even on follow-up questions. One user stated: \"The Perplexity from 3 months ago would leave most people speechless; today's version mostly skips web search completely the first time.\"\n\nHallucination of Sources\nDeep Research has generated completely fabricated citations and numerical data, then maintained false claims when challenged. A lawyer using Deep Research for document analysis received entirely fabricated data and citations to sources that didn't exist. When asked for quotes and citations, it \"complied convincingly\" but the citations were false.\n\nAccuracy Concerns Despite Claims\nPerplexity claims 91.3% search accuracy and 3.5% hallucination rate, but real-world testing reveals problems. On job search research, a user found links didn't lead to listed jobs, descriptions were thin, and hyperlinks were flat-out wrong. By contrast, OpenAI's Deep Research (slower) had 100% accurate links and detailed information. When Deep Research used on specialized topics with weak data coverage, users reported needing to fact-check 30-50% of findings.\n\nDeepSeek R1 Liability\nDeep Research relies on DeepSeek R1, which has a ~14% hallucination rate—significantly higher than Claude (6%) or GPT-4 (8%). This explains the observed fabrication issues.\n\nSubscription & Billing Problems\nUsers report unexpected charges even after cancellation, persistent pop-ups asking to \"upgrade to Pro\" when already subscribed, and inability to upload PDFs (a core Pro feature). Customer service is purely automated email with no human support, making disputes unresolvable.\n\nLimited Feature Customization\nNo plugins, no personalization beyond model selection, and a rigid one-size-fits-all interface. For $20/month, users expected more flexibility.\n\nNo Conversation Memory\nMust re-introduce yourself and context on every query. Platform inconsistency means features appear/disappear without notice.\n\nPoor Data Visualization\nStruggles with charts, summaries, and structured outputs from complex datasets.",

I'm currently a teacher and often deal with lots of idiocy and gaslighting from parents, admin, and students alike. \n\nI find Perplexity the most helpful when I ask questions directly related to district policy on dealing with specific issues. Perplexity will reference district policy and state law in helping me navigate how to best address certain issues. \n\nFor example, I've asked about how often I'm required to contact a parent when a child is failing. My commonsense told me that the parents should be checking the online grade book regularly. However, parents and administrators try to gaslight me into thinking that I need to call the parent daily or weekly when their child is not doing what they’re supposed to do. \n\nAnother situation is when admin told me that I need to provide after school tutoring for failing students. My initial thought was that I should not be required to do that when I’ve done my job during the day. Perplexity helped me to see that I don’t have to do that and showed me the policy, etc. \n\nAnother critical situation is that when I have a wild and disruptive student in class and need them removed so that other students can learn, admin would refuse to remove them and ask whether I’d called the parent just before removal. That’s ridiculous because I’m teaching and all instruction would have to stop so that I could call the parent. Perplexity helped to show me the law and teacher's rights for my state in having a student removed when they are disrupting instruction. Apparently, that disruptive student absolutely must be removed.\n\nI hope that my examples helped you to understand how I'm finding Perplexity useful in my case. But, in law, no. I wouldn't rely on it at all. I've used Westlaw and Lexis in the past and would not rely on Perplexity as an alterative.",

Gemini is so loose and lazy, forcing its training knowledge vs checking vs fresh web data. \n\nI actually find Google One AI Premium to be the best offer right now, getting 2TB of storage, $10 Cloud credits, and sharing the AI benefits with 5 family members for $20 is a steal. But if you ask me which one is the superior product right now? It’s clearly Perplexity.\n\nA few reasons why I think it still wins in 2026:\n\n * Model Agnosticism: This is the killer feature. Perplexity isn’t pressured by foundation model development. If a the GPT models turn out to be weak, Perplexity isn't screwed. you just swap models. If the Gemini model is having a bad month, the Gemini app is just … bad. You don't have that single point of failure.\n\n * The \"Whole Product\" Experience: Holistically, the app is just better. The voice input and text-to-speech are far beyond what you get from the standalone Claude or Gemini apps. PPLX Memory is finally on par with ChatGPT, and the limits are way more generous for daily use (even if you \"only\" get Sonnet and not Opus on PPLX Pro).\n\n * Browsers: If you care about full AI browsers, Comet seems like the best option right now, though I’m still cautious about prompt injection so I limit my usage there.\n\nFor me, unless you have a super specific creative roleplay use case, Perplexity is the only one that effectively disappears and lets you actually get work done.",

But LLM technology is becoming exponentially more efficient, and increasingly does not need massive brute-force quantities... so! This takes power away from those American companies; people will not remain dependent on their services... in a few years... I dare say... 2 to 5 years... you will already be able to run a good LLM on your desktop, without needing to depend on a company that offers cloud services... and this must be the path forward... even if American companies don't like the idea!!\n\n\n\nIf Perplexity makes sense in 2026, yes, it does, and very much so! However, it is not with these kinds of limitations that Pro users will be able to survive. Yet... it will only be a matter of time before more companies start doing what Perplexity does...",

You can download ANY LLM you want to use. They have a drop down list in both LM Studio and AnythingLLM where you can pick models to download. \n\nThe reason I use both is LM Studio is my ENGINE while AnythingLLM is my BRAIN, basically. This was done to get a bit more headroom in the memory functionality, but it's not required. You can just download LM Studio and run from it or AnythingLLM. \n\nI will say this, AnythjngLLM also has a mobile application, which maybe more useful for using PC and Phone.

      "text": "A while back, I got a legitimate 1-year voucher for Perplexity Pro through my ISP (a very well-regarded, high-end provider). I’ve been using it for a few months now and generally like the service. However, I just received an incredibly pushy email from Perplexity stating that if I don’t enter my billing details immediately, my Pro subscription will be terminated.\n\nWell, they weren't kidding. They’ve already \"paused\" my Pro features until I hand over my payment info.\n\nThe obvious goal here is to force me into an auto-renewal so they can start charging me the second the promo ends. Look, don't get me wrong, I’m not some \"freeloader\" looking for a handout. I spend over €100/month on various AI subscriptions and API credits for my workflow. I have no problem paying for value.\n\nBut this feels so cheap. If you partner with a reputable company to distribute vouchers, don't make it the customer's problem. It’s like they’re handing out these promos like candy to pump their user numbers, but then treating those same users with zero trust.\n\nMy code is 100% legit from a Tier-1 provider, yet I'm being held hostage for my CC details halfway through the agreed term. It’s just a \"low-rent\" move for a company trying to compete with the big players.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? Did you cave and give the info?",

I switched to Claude for daily use and the difference is night and day, and I was in your exact situation with Perplexity.\n\nWith Claude, the chat just keeps building. If it gets long, it makes room and keeps going instead of forcing you to start over and retrain everything from scratch. The memory system actually works across separate conversations. I can close a chat, come back days later in a completely new thread, and Claude already knows my context, my projects, my preferences, all of it. No retraining needed. Important note though: if you delete a chat, Claude won’t remember that conversation unless you specifically told it to remember something from it.\n\nI’m not coding with it, just daily life stuff. Research, planning, working through problems, general questions. The only time I hit a rate limit is if I’m really going hard with a ton of questions back-to-back for like 4 hours straight, then I might wait like 20 minutes. But that’s rare and honestly fair for how much I’m using it.\n\nClaude’s also way more conversational than Perplexity. It actually feels like talking to someone instead of just getting search results thrown at you. You can work through ideas, ask follow ups naturally, and it adapts to how you communicate.\n\nCompare that to Perplexity where you’re constantly hitting that “start a new thread” wall and wasting hours re-explaining everything. Plus Claude isn’t spamming you with popups begging you to upgrade when you’re already paying for Pro. The respect for paid users is actually there.\n\nThe memory feature isn’t perfect. Sometimes you need to remind it on really specific technical details. But it’s genuinely functional and saves massive amounts of time. You can even tell Claude “remember this” or “forget that” and it actually listens.\n\nIf that single memory issue is killing your productivity with Perplexity, Claude’s worth trying. The Pro subscription actually feels worth it here.\n\nHonestly, Perplexity’s garbage support ended up doing me a favor. Forced my hand to switch and I’m glad it did. Best productivity move I’ve made in a while.",
