Are you using Research mode because you need it to pull in new web sources alongside your Space files, or are you only analyzing the existing documents you’ve already uploaded?\n  \n2. Research mode already produces comprehensive synthesized reports. Are you finding its initial output insufficient, or is the multi-model rewriting (Gemini → Claude → GPT) for a specific formatting/tone requirement?",

It's sturdy, hard working, long detailed outputs (my analogy is falling apart now) and it can understand various documents and summarise them.\n\n\nIt can then also collate the various summaries of the dozens of files I uploaded, and keeps the context (non research seems to forget after 10 or 20 documents the first ones, without re prompting) \n\n\nI save my outputs into word or md file. Then once I have built my picture of understanding, I ask research mode to collate all in the thread / space (and upload or paste the outputs) - to create a master answer of sorts \n\n\nOnce I quickly verify everything I want is listed and understood correctly, then I can move on to reasoning models. As research is great but ott and not helpful for humans to read. \n\n\nUsually at this stage, I get gemini native app (outside of perplexity) on pro mode to assess this master output (usually accompanied by a prompt perplexity gives me, giving all the context required, as gemini has none of the abilities perplexity does for me, and forget always) - with some of the core documents uploaded too \n\n\nThen I revert back to perplexity, and use a reasoning model. Claude I find the best, gemini next. Chat gtp is better now, but habbit I just use it for the final layer, to make it more readable \n\n\nMy use case is complicated legal, medical, employment etc.. So text based. Analysing documents. Creating timeliness and understanding etc.. \n\n\nResearch mode gets all of this information there. But it's basically unusable, as no one reads 50 pages. But I find without research mode I am constantly manually inputting everything the search modes are missing \n\n\n- I am aware I'm likely misusing, as search is for online search, but honestly, the outputs are better than via gemini alone. Research mode is the basis of this imho. Takes a little longer, but is comprehensive\n\n\nSorry, to answer also. Web sources are helpful. But not so much my aim. Gemini app i find better for quoting law etc. But perplexity gives a good base layer for gemini to build on I find. The sources are helpful for checking, but tbh I tweak my prompt to be specific to my country, the laws etc.. This is where using my limited gemini prompts at key stages helps to guide perplexity - and vice versa, as the info research mode gives helps gemini produce much better answers than just the prompt alone\n\n\nI think I answered q 2 above kinda ha I should have asked perplexity to re word my neurondivergent stream of consciousness!! ",

I always find myself going to Perplexity for my go-to for a detailed research for normal \"day to day\" things - non-academic, non-finance, just normal things - like troubleshooting IT Issues, optimal picture profiles for TVs, best Spark Plugs for a specific car, etc etc.\n\nI'd say over the last 5 months or so, Research was \"good\" - would take 1-2 minutes to return a result that feels better than any of the other tools when doing a normal tool-calling web-search (Excluding social media targeted questions, like \"research the top 20 most recommended SSDs from Reddit Posts and X Posts - where Grok takes the crown), but for complex things, like, engineering a scope of work for a large IT project, I'd tend to rely more on running dual GPT5.2 Pro Heavy tool calling search on my Enterprise Account, and GPT5.2 Pro Deep Research on my Pro account synthesize the results.\n\nBUT - over the last week or so, Research is taking 3-15 minutes (Using research, not Labs) - and I'm HERE FOR IT. Output is much better, seems like it's pulling a ton more sources, and is handling multi-step instruction following much better.\n\nSo - first, is anyone else seeing this?

The new Research oddly at first doesn’t think the Switch 2 was released yet, stating it should be out by mid 2025, but then shortly after realizes it is out, and then found relevant sources for comparison.  It feels like the finished result shouldn’t have included this, but it did come up with a very long and detailed response in the end.\n\nAs for which is “Better”, in this one use case I’m not sure if having a longer slightly all over the place answer is better, but in fairness it did look through a lot of sources and other than the mixup at the beginning (which in later corrected), it was a very detailed answer.  I think the original old Research query could easily have been what Gemini Pro model in Search mode could have output.\n\nTLDR; they definitely changed it from last week and it covers a lot more sources and gives a much longer answer.  “Better”, hard to say, but definitely more information.",

I get an all around chat bot from a company that I know is here to stay.\n\nPerplexity is for agility. It kills FOMO as I’m not stuck with one AI model developer. I still believe ChatGPT is the single best chatbot if you can’t pair it with anything else, but you won’t have access to Anthropic there. I also prefer the Perplexity interaction for most prompts through the day, where I’m forced to ask a clear question rather than an open ended chat. \n\nPersonally, I’m a big fan of Perplexity Memory and Discover news feed (especially the read aloud audio). I don’t yet understand what Labs is for. Perplexity probably uses Whisper for dictation and ElevenLabs/another high end speech AI for speech. The other major AI apps don’t mix and match like that. \n\nUltimately, I get the flexibility with this stack. You get the stability of the Google ecosystem paired with Perplexity’s unique focus and model flexibility.",

I do regularly check the sources for Perplexity and haven’t been disappointed yet.\n\nI keep tossing around the idea of using Claude with it instead, but from what I’ve heard it has a stricter session time for Pro usage than CGPT - so I’m not sure if it’s worth it.

As paying customers, that’s literally our job. If something slips, we should say it clearly, because that’s how products improve.\n\nA lot of long-time subscribers, whether they’ve been around since 2024 or even early 2025, have watched the experience get worse in very noticeable ways. The best example is Deep Research. It’s not as thorough anymore, and it doesn’t reason for as long. Back in January 2025, Deep Research could take 10 minutes, sometimes 20, even 30, depending on the task. Now it’ll “finish” in under 8 minutes. Sometimes speed is nice, but in research mode, that time used to translate into depth.\n\nTo be clear, I’m not calling Perplexity garbage. It’s still a great tool and it offers a lot of useful features. The bigger concern is that it’s falling behind, and it hasn’t been innovative in the one area where it had a real niche.\n\nPerplexity’s edge was that it was basically the only AI subscription that consistently gave real-time, up-to-date sources and citations in a clean, research-first workflow. It was an AI search engine with chatbot capabilities, search first, chatbot second. But now it feels like they’re trying to transform into being “the next ChatGPT” or “the next Gemini,” stacking on features to compete with ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude, etc. \n\nThe problem is those apps already do the “general AI assistant” thing better, and they have bigger context windows and stronger reasoning workflows, great image and video generation models and actual LLMs. \n\nAt this point, other major chatbots have dramatically improved web search and deep research, and honestly they’re better than Perplexity at the thing Perplexity used to own. So Perplexity is slowly shifting from a tool built for researchers, professionals, students, academics, and business users into something closer to an entry-level AI chatbot for casual users. If you’re doing serious professional work, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and even Grok can be way more intuitive and power-user friendly.\n\nAnd again, I don’t hate Perplexity. I still think it has a ton of potential. That’s why it’s frustrating. Instead of doubling down on what made it special, being at the forefront of AI web search and deep research, it’s spending energy on features that other platforms already have (like image generation). \n\nIf you actually use Perplexity daily, most people would rather see them improve the search model, expand context limits, allow longer and more detailed responses, improve memory (real long-term memory, not “beta that barely exists”), and fix the issue where the model changes mid-thread without telling you. That last one is a massive flaw. You should not be guessing what model you’re talking to halfway through a workflow.\n\nAlso, a big part of what’s keeping Perplexity afloat right now feels like partnerships, bundles, and giving away 1-year Pro subscriptions through deals. That’s not a long-term strategy if the core experience keeps slipping.\n\nOne place where I’ll give them full credit is the Comet browser. Honestly it’s the best AI browser right now, and it’s not even close. It’s the only one that actually feels like it can do autonomous agentic tasks reliably, opening tabs, scrolling, navigating pages, filling out forms, adding things to cart. It’s miles ahead of the rest.\n\nWhat annoys me is when people say “Perplexity is the best tool for research” as if it’s still 2024 or early 2025. A lot of the time, that take comes from people who don’t really know how to use ChatGPT or Gemini for research. If you actually have Gemini Pro/Ultra or ChatGPT Plus/Pro and you know how to prompt properly, the deep research output is often more thorough, more logically structured, and more useful. You can get extensive, credible sources with clickable links, and the reasoning is usually stronger and more consistent.\n\nWhere Perplexity is still great: definitions, everyday quick searches, updates, launches, and news. Basically the kinds of things you’d normally do on Google with Chrome or Safari, but you want a cleaner answer with sources fast. Perplexity is excellent for that. But beyond that, I’m struggling to see it as a primary research tool anymore, because ChatGPT and Gemini have caught up and surpassed it in deep research and web search quality.\n\nSo for me, Perplexity is a second or third subscription, not the main one. If you’re a casual user who wants an AI app for quick learning, light studying, and everyday searches, it’s great. But if your workload ramps up and you’re doing real academic or business research, it’s just not the best tool anymore. Compare it directly to ChatGPT’s reasoning, long memory, and context window. Same for Gemini, especially with Google’s indexing and sourcing. It’s a different level.\n\nHere’s what would actually help Perplexity get back on track:\n\t1.\tIncrease the context window for outputs and responses. Right now it’s about 32K across the models they offer. They should at least double that. In 2026, 32K isn’t impressive. It’s starting to feel like 8K did back in 2023 with GPT 3. \n\t2.\tFix and properly build long-term memory. It’s still in beta and feels close to non-existent. Meanwhile, ChatGPT and Gemini actually remember preferences and constraints. If I tell them I want metric units, prices in CAD, or I don’t want certain wording, they keep that consistent. That kind of reliability matters a lot when you’re using these tools daily.\n\t3.\tFix the mid-thread model switching issue. If the model changes inside a single thread after a few searches, users should be told clearly. Silent switching ruins trust and makes results inconsistent, especially for research workflows.\n\nAnd expanding the context window should not only mean longer answers. It should also mean better handling of inputs, especially uploaded files. I don’t really trust Perplexity’s analysis when I upload a 10-page or 20-page PDF. It often feels like it’s not fully reading it. I trust ChatGPT and Gemini a lot more there, partly because their OCR and document handling are stronger, and partly because the context window actually lets them process the full text more reliably.\n\nThat’s the whole point. Perplexity is still good, but it could be much better. People raising concerns aren’t “complaining.” They’re signalling that the product is slipping and that Perplexity still has the opportunity to lead again if it focuses on the right priorities.",

From reading this sub, it seems that every tech bro in a certain large South Asian nation was signing up huge numbers of users that may or may not be real, and may or may not ever turn into actual revenue for the company. \n\nPro became the new Free, as no company can actually offer a premium service for literally nothing. I guess the hope is that some of the 0/year folks will turn into paying customers after the year, but it's hard to expect someone to pay for a wide that's now performing like a freemium model. ",

      "text": "I’ve bounced between pretty much every major AI tool this year, but the two I keep coming back to are Gemini and Perplexity. Short version: I’ll keep a Gemini tab around in 2026 because I like to sanity-check things across models, but Perplexity is staying my main “workhorse” for anything that feels like actual research or day-to-day productivity. Especially with all the recent noise around Gemini, I felt like sharing my thoughts would be great and I would like to hear what others think as well. I'm sure this will get attraction of both sides, haters and lovers, as long as there's some good discussion. My problem with Gemini is simple: I don’t trust it with anything that matters. It’s flashy, sometimes clever, but it feels loose. It ignores instructions, drifts off into weird tangents, and hallucinates with way more confidence than I’m comfortable with. When I’m already tired, the last thing I want is to babysit an AI that keeps deciding it knows better than my prompt.\n\nPerplexity is not perfect, but it’s predictable enough that I can build real routines on top of it. Spaces are the second big thing for me. Being able to throw docs, PDFs, and links into one place and then treat that as a dedicated research pool changes how I prep for projects. I keep separate Spaces for work, side projects, and random rabbit holes. I don’t need to remember which chat had which link from three weeks ago. It’s all there, and I can keep querying it as the project evolves. Then there’s Comet. Having a browser that is built around this stuff instead of bolting AI on as an afterthought makes a difference. The built-in widgets, the way it handles search, the ability to keep research, browsing, and writing in the same environment without constant copy-paste gymnastics fits how I actually work. For long sessions, it feels like a proper “AI workstation” instead of just another tab. In 2026 I’ll keep checking Gemini whenever there’s a big update, because I like knowing what’s out there and sometimes it does give an angle I wouldn’t have considered. But I'll definitely keep PPLX in my rotation for next year",

It linked to too many sources that literally didn't have the info, so I quit very fast, not sure if they made progress since then. Now my okay-ish solution is HaloMate. It has hosted my entire workflow as I also got the trust issue with AI models. Now I got the habit to double check the output by regenerate answers using multiple models. My to-go trio right now is ClaudeOpus, GPT5T and GeminiPro. It's interesting to see how they \"think\" so differently sometimes, and also it's good to have them cross-check each other before I do the final check or merge while all context stays. The reason why I said ok-ish is because it does not offer image generation models that I sometimes need to use, but the good side is we still use Gemini at work so I can leverage the nano banana.",

          "text": "This is all very interesting to me to watch and engage in as it is happening and new developments drop almost weekly. \n\nI am a non-coder in the construction consulting business. I am finding there is a limit to Ai effectiveness from a time management perspective with reoccurring tasks. I started paying for Perplexity Pro a few months ago and looking into spaces. I now use a few spaces for work and a couple of health. \n\nSome of my files are pretty large and Gemini (also pay for pro) GEMS lets me upload the larger files and gives me very good responses. \n\nI have created my prompt for one major task and refined it by going back and forth between Gemini and Perplexity. It has gotten pretty good. It still needs a little tweaking but I am confident in the results I am getting so I am happy with that. \n\nOddly enough, I work in Microsoft and got into Ai through CoPilot. I quickly upgraded to Pro and was really excited to play with it and hopefully help me with my work, but have not found the pay off and may actually drop my subscription. It is not delivering - especially the ones embedded within Word, Excel, Outlook. \n\nI used Comet for a few weeks and really liked it and then I read some things about the security of it and got of out of it. I liked the functionality of it though. \n\nFor 2026 to me it is \"justify your existence\". I am going to do a time audit for a week on myself and act accordingly. I like my Ai toys for sure, but again, from a production standpoint, I am not sure. \n\nReading the tea leaves, and I fully acknowledge my statement may be completely unfounded or not realistic as I am not a IT or someone really knowledgeable in the Ai world.\n\nMoney is going to start winning out. I see the larger companies distancing themselves. The mad rush for energy is going to win and it is going to take big bucks to cover the gap until long term solutions are in place. I also think there will be consolidation and capacity purchasing. I also think the culture / energy impacts of all of this is going to get louder as we start to realize/accept the \"Cost\" of all of this mad rush in Ai Development. \n\nI think Gemini through it's google platform and CoPilot through it's Microsoft platform are going to be the most stable long term and they will start doing what they normally do and start restricting (if they have not already) how 3rd party platforms can interact with them, so they can protect their market share.  Again, my ignorance may be showing with this statement. \n\nI am thinking Perplexity has a place, but it seems to be losing it's way a little with value for Pro and not pushing everyone to their highest tier, and if they can get with Comet platform secure, this would be a huge win. \n\nI think Gemini will probably have some of the largest developments in 2026 but all of the shine in Ai is going to start wearing off except for the people in coding or specifically in the tech world. Schleps like me are only going to be able to use it so far. \n\nI think 2026 will also include more medical and mental/counseling type Ai platform development because the common joes are using it so much for this. \n\nI circle back around to my first statement. I don't remember an industry this dynamic with its development and it is a blast to live in it.",

Requiring a card for a trial is normal, and it’s there because people abuse trials nonstop, and companies aren’t going to keep eating that cost. It's clearly obvious in this sub a lot of people have gotten Pro plans through \"friends\" or non-conventional means and now that they're caught they are flooding this sub with negativity. Yes, it’s annoying, but it’s not shady by default. The shady part would be charging you early or hiding the date, and that’s not what this is. If you start a trial with a card on file and you forget to cancel, that’s on you. Set a reminder and move on. It's only frustrating that people who received promotional deals properly get caught in the crossfire but it's not the end of the world for us to put in a card either. I also think some of the outrage is performative. People act like typing in a card number is some new betrayal, but this has been how subscriptions work for years. If you don’t want to give card info, don’t start the trial. If you do want to test it, you accept that it’s a trial that converts unless you cancel. The only problem would be unclear billing or surprise charges, and if that happens, then you have a real complaint.",

Outputs are nowhere near the quality and depth when compared to before. I have comprehensive notebooks setup for my work with multiple artifacts uploaded, with custom conversational styles and max output length in settings - and everything is just straight up ignored. This happens with Gemini 3.0 on the Gemini platform too. For my use case, I want responses to use both my uploaded context and the web. \n\nI'm currently looking into other alternatives to move to, mainly - Chatgpt projects, Perplexity spaces and Claude projects. I had previously used Perplexity spaces before (I got access to the free pro subscription and moved completely to notebooklm when it expired). My perplexity spaces used Gemini 2.5 pro combined with web search and the response qualities were really good, but with significant model rate limits. \n\nI had not previously used Chatgpt projects and Claude projects. Is there anyone here who has used all three of these products? Which is currently the best? (currently leaning towards spaces but ready to hear other opinions)",

      "text": "I'm a heavy user. I don’t mind paying 10x more for a 10x better or just 3 to 4 times better product. But I don’t want to pay 10x more just to get back to the same level of quality I had before.\n\nI’ve been paying for Perplexity Pro for a while now, and over the past few weeks the experience has started to feel worse. It’s noticeably downgraded in ways that are hard to ignore, especially when you use it every day.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was answer quality and length. Lately the research responses feel shorter and less thorough than they used to be, as if the system is trying to cut off early. \n\nThe second thing is image generation. Earlier, I felt I could comfortably generate a fair number of images before hitting any friction. Now I run into limits much sooner, like three or four images per day. The ceiling feels much lower than it used to be.\n\nGiven the timing of the new Max version, it’s hard not to get the impression that Pro is being squeezed so that Max looks more attractive, especially for people who rely on longer answers, heavy research, or a lot of media generation.\n\nIf Perplexity wants to sell a more expensive tier, that’s fair. I wouldn’t mind paying more if it meant better service. But they should add value at the top, not quietly chip away at the value of the existing paid tier. Be explicit about limits, show the quotas clearly, and if those limits change over time, communicate that openly so users can decide if they still want to pay for what they’re getting. When things just get a bit worse with no explanation, it feels less like product evolution and more like being pushed into an upsell.\n\nOn top of that, the new Max tier is priced in the same ballpark as other premium offerings like Claude Max. If I’m being pushed to pay more anyway, then I should ask myself: why shouldn’t I just switch to Claude Max instead?",

I hope they address or fix this soon, becase as much as I really want to be a paying user, I can't if they shit over Pro users in favour of those who use Max.",

Image and video features are cool, but they’re the first things I’d unbundle into a separate pack or hard cap, and keep Pro focused on deep search, stable limits, and fast follow‑ups. \n\nIf they just said: “Pro = X research runs/day, Y file uploads, Z images, here’s what changed since last month,” most of this frustration goes away because you can judge if it’s still worth it.\nIf they insist on tiers, I’d rather see something like: Pro = stable researcher plan, Max = frontier models and media toys, and maybe a cheap “search‑only” plan for people who don’t care about images at all. I’ve ended up mixing tools (Perplexity for quick lookups, Claude for long reasoning, plus stuff like Pulse and other monitoring tools for keeping tabs on niche topics) instead of trusting one product to do everything. Main point: be upfront with limits and let Pro stay a reliable workhorse, not a slow funnel into Max.",

For example I have a Google Pro subscription and all users are complaining that Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro were much more powerful at launch. \n\nSo if models are getting less good and Perplexity is adding throttling on top of that, we can expect bigger downgrades. \n\nA good solution to fight this regressive tuning is to use multiple models to get detailed answers and this is exactly what Perplexity is made for. But in the end the solution will be to hope that new models and competition keep moving the cursor upward. \n\nI personally wouldn't pay $200 for Perplexity, it's impossible to know what you get exactly under the hood.

If Max works this well, and Pro suddenly degraded so noticeably at the same time- that can't be a coincidence. It looks like a conscious decision to increase the gap between plans and force people to upgrade.\n\nThe problem is, this isn't an honest way to sell a more expensive product. If Max was simply better than a stable Pro – okay, I pay more for more. But when Pro gets worse to make Max look better? That's manipulation, not added value. Especially since there's no official communication about changes to limits or quality – everything happens quietly, and users have to figure out for themselves what happened.\n\nAfter all, it was similar with the removal of the o3-mini model from Max – the change happened quietly overnight, without any announcements. You pay $200 a month and they take away one of the two models available only in Max without a word.\n\nAll these behaviors from Perplexity are not fair to the consumer and rather discourage and erode trust in this brand.",

      "text": "ChatGPT Pro was the only AI service for which I was paying, but not anymore. OpenAI seems to be kind of all over the place rn, with hurried and inferior model releases, pushing out features like health, which nobody asked for. Icing on the cake was Gemini closing the siri deal with Apple. Seems to be the perfect time to cancel now, given how degraded the platform has become after the 5.2 release. But truth be told, their Codex product is one of the best in market (I used the Codex extension for vscode, they provide really generous rate limits even for the $20 plus sub)\n\nI'm using other products right now (Gemini for writing/media generation, Claude for claude code, Perplexity for general web search/to access different models in one place, GitHub copilot, Notion, etc. for which I have the free yearly sub from my edu mail) and the experience has been much better. OpenAI's times up.",

I realize the models have to still go through Perplexity before you get your response and that may be a little different than if you go directly to the model on their platform but I believe the difference is minimal. Actually, Perplexity Pro has an advantage because I can use Claude from claude.ai and sometimes the servers are busy or after so many prompts, I get timed out. Not the case with using Claude through Perplexity.",

Well, because it shows they are ignoring my instruction to use reasoning.\n\nPreviously, it carefully took it's time to answer but now it is an instant answer no matter what. The issue is that it's a worse answer every time. Reasoning reduces hallucination and increasing the model's ability to carefully consider all sources. But today the answers have just been plain wrong 60% of the time.\n\nI literally just asked it a question about the RTX 5070 just now and it replied with \"this is a hypothetical GPU but ...\"\n\nIf it was Gemini 3 Pro or GPT 5.2 Thinking it would have never replied arguing that the RTX 5070 is a hypothetical GPU. But even though I selected GPT 5.2 Thinking (also tried with Gemini 3 Pro), they both replied with the same answer. They are very shadily  ignoring the model selector.\n\nThese types of silly stumbles only happen when you don't use reasoning models. This is not my only issue today but it is the most recent one.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, the number of sources searched keeps reducing. Previously, it searched like 100 sources. Then it got reduced to 20; and today it's 15.",

Like the actual ratings 8.2 and Gemini decided it was 6.7, a rating that movie never had at any point in time. Interestingly Google Search shows all of this accurately in their summary but of course that’s not LLM. \n\nIt also had trouble with movie names like “Predator Badlands (previously known as Predator Killer of Killers)”. When I asked why it conflated two separate movies it said because they were two movies of the same franchise in the same year, it thought they were the same and then hallucinated a name change.\n\nWhen I used ChatGPT for stock research, it kept hallucinating businesses, deals and entire companies that just did not exist. \n\nThis is inherent to nature of how LLMs work and is unlikely to go away completely ever.",

It’s not that Perplexity can’t perform some tasks at a base level, because it can.\n\nLet me give you an example. I was drafting a new warehouse lease contract for a recently purchased facility. I needed a very specific format with our corporate color scheme, and the process required extensive back-and-forth. It was a highly customized lease agreement, so I iterated with Claude for roughly four to five hours, generating an entirely new contract each time.\n\nClaude maintained context on a 20-page contract for those five hours. I never had to correct it once. I simply kept iterating and refining, over and over again.\n\nWhat made this possible was Claude’s Compact. The way it’s designed is genuinely ingenious: it enables exactly this kind of sustained, context-aware iteration over long, complex documents.\n\nThis is something people in the business world don’t want to acknowledge: situations on the ground and dynamics change constantly. As you write a contract and make it more bulletproof, you keep identifying small issues and keep revising and building until you finally arrive at something solid.\n\nThat kind of work is not really possible in Perplexity.\n\nWe also use Claude for Excel spreadsheets and bulk market research. Once you’ve used all the AI tools for extended periods, you can very quickly ascertain each one’s strengths and weaknesses. They all have them.\n\nBut as an extremely heavy user of all of these tools since day one, I have found this to be the best combination: Perplexity for real-time results, appraisal assistance, or anything time-sensitive. Claude for the actual heavy lifting that would normally take a human many hours to complete.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

          "text": "Yes and no. It really depends.\n\nIt really depends because Perplexity is a great tool for web search and research. However, its research reports, whether conducted via deep research or Pro Search, are nowhere near as thorough as Gemini's or ChatGPT's web search or deep research. You also have to define what you really mean by research, because Perplexity's deep research feature takes anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes; in ChatGPT and Gemini, it could take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes or more. The extra time spent thinking indicates that it takes much longer to reason, and it synthesizes and analyzes the information more deeply and thoroughly than Perplexity.\n\n**The main difference between Gemini/between Gemini and ChatGPT, and Perplexity, on the other hand, is that Perplexity is more of a search engine for fact-checking, finding information, and giving you that information directly and quickly. However, by conducting deep research on ChatGPT or Gemini, using the right prompt and as much information as you can about your research, your task, your project, or your general query, it will analyze, synthesize, and use advanced logic and reasoning. So it really does think, while Perplexity just presents the information.**\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love Perplexity. While I was at the forefront of AI web search and research, it was the first app that could accurately find sources and conduct research reports with citations. All other AI chatbots that have web search and deep research features accurately do this now. The deep research feature on Gemini and ChatGPT is again much more thorough and extensive, and it uses a higher level of logic and reasoning, which makes sense given their larger context windows.\n\n**The models used in ChatGPT and Gemini are the maximum capacity of that model, but that same model used in Perplexity is a fine-tuned system prompted by Perplexity to act in a certain way, and strictly, they're systems prompted for web search and scanning and scouring the web using the parameters within the parameters of Perplexity. All models in Perplexity are limited to 32k context tokens. So, where Gemini 3 Pro has a 1 million context token, the equivalent of 1500 pages of text or 500,000 words, in Perpelxity, it's 32k.**\n\nThis also affects the responses it gives you, how much information it can analyze, synthesize, and understand, and how much information in the attached files it can read and understand due to Gemini's high context window. You could attach PDFs that are hundreds of pages, and it would synthesize and understand the entire thing, or it could reference specific pages if you ask it to find your information, quotes, facts, etc.\n\nThe same applies to ChatGPT with the thinking model. It has 196,000 context tokens. While again, in Perplexity, it is limited to a 32K context. Perplexity is limited by all of them because they pay for these models, which you can use with your subscription. So if they increase it, it will cost them much more. And it wouldn't be affordable, and they wouldn't make any money.\n\n**Think of it this way: Gemini 3 Pro in Gemini, you can use it up to 100% capacity. It's logic, it's reasoning, it's analysis, it's a context window. However, in Perplexity, you're using it at around 25% capacity. Those numbers aren't accurate, but they're just meant to put it into perspective.**\n\n**You can test this out yourself by giving Perplexity a prompt using Gemini 3 Pro or GPT 5.2 thinking using deep research, and then using the exact same prompt in ChatGPT and Gemini itself using the exact same models. You will see that the response it gives you will be quite different. The quality and length of the responses the Gemini and ChatGPT would give you in their own chatbots would be much better(thorough, longer, better logic and reasoning and analysis)**\n\nSee my reply to my comment for more info below:",

              "text": "Also, both ChatGPT and Gemini can find your URL. If it's available, and they're clickable links, they have improved their deep research feature at an astronomical rate, and it's night and day compared to a year ago. They've just drastically improved their source selection, the credibility of the sources, the sites they have access to, and the context of their deep research.\n\nOn the one hand, Gemini has an advantage because of Google's indexing and better access to websites and sources. Google wrote the game on the search engine; they basically invented the modern search engine as we know it. In my opinion, Gemini seems to be the most accurate for deep research, and it does give you a nice layout - spaces between paragraphs, headings, subheadings, bullet points, or in paragraph format, a mix of these things. In Pro and Ultra, you also get images, graphs, and tables. With ChatGPT, you don't really get the graphs, tables, and the nice layout, but it's also great at source selection, providing citations, and I find ChatGPT's deep research to be the most logically coherent and analytical, and it also has the best context. \n\n**For research, whether it is academic research, business research, for your startup, at work, or for any personal query or topic you're interested in, Perplexity is great. However, it's better suited for the preliminary stages of research, just to get a quick analysis or a quick scoop of information. I like to think of Perplexity as a brainstorming tool and also a great tool for quick fact-checking, updates, news, information, and definitions.**\n\n**While Gemini and ChatGPT are definitely the main AI tools to use for the writing process due to their context windows, I then jump into Gemini or ChatGPT for even more in-depth research. For instance, I might research US intervention in the Middle East and what has led to it since the 1970s. I would start by proposing a research question or asking a bunch of questions of Perplexity to find the best scholars, most prominent professors, researchers, or most prominent academic journals on these topics, or to get an overall consensus on the body of academic research.** \n\n**From there, once I gather some information, I will feed it into Gemini or ChatGPT for more in-depth analysis, pinpoint the exact sources and their abstracts, and dive deeper into each author's work and get my research started.** \n\n**Therefore, Perplexity is not the \"best\" AI tool for research. However, it is still a \"great\" tool for research, and the best tool for web search, i.e., it's a great replacement for everyday Google searches. It is the tool you should use first for brainstorming or to get some ideas going, and then for the actual work, analysis, and more in-depth, thorough research. ChatGPT and Gemini are better options.** \n\n**So it goes like this:** \n\n\n\n**1) Perplexity: Quick information, fact-checking, updates, news, and then generating ideas, brainstorming and planning.** \n\n**2) Gemini and ChatGPT: More in-depth, thorough research writing, research reports, large content generation (such as reports, blogs, papers), or helping with lengthier work using their Canvas features. Ensure you use Projects in ChatGPT and Noteboard in Gemini to organize your research and your workflow, projects, or tasks.**  \n\n**Eg, I have a notebooklm notebook and a ChatGPT project dedicated to each research paper I am writing as a university student. It helps me organize my notes, thoughts, ideas, outlines, research, etc. (the same workflow can be used for business, work, and content creators)**",

People will use a trial for 30 days, but it won't break their habit.  How do I know?  I'll give you a guess, i did some research with a good AI and it gave me the references to back it up.  Goes like this.\n\n1 get users on board at all costs. Burn VC$.  Get them using the product to the point they don't want to use Google Search any more.  (I got there  in about a week)  \n2 work out how to introduce ads that don't piss people off.     \n3. Shed the freeloaders.\n\nThey have some unique challenges.  Their target market is not \"what' the capital of France\", it's in-depth, complex queries.  Their user base tends to be more tech savvy, and with a higher disposable income.  The demographic has a *five times higher* online spend than the average.  So Perplexity users should be a highly sought after target.\n\nthere's two issues with that.  Firstly, on average, 1 in 3 people block ads.  In the high spend demographic it's 1 in 2 - we are much harder to target with advertising.  We don't like cheap collab deals (15% off Uber Eats for example) that are transparently costing the company nothing and are just another form of advertising.  The percentage of Linux, and Firefox users, is higher too, users who can completely block whatever they want unlike Chrome / Edge.  Our more complex queries carry a higher cost per user on average too.\n\nSo here you have a service specifically servicing a high spending demographic, that hates being marketed to, and costs more per user.\n\nHope that sheds some light on what's going on.  If in doubt, ask Perplexity the right questions, think critically, challenge all its assumptions and assertions and check the references.  If you can't, you're probably in the wrong r/.",

After enough reps, I've finally figured out where each one actually earns its keep.\n\n* **Perplexity** for research and quick answers. It just works. \n* **Claude** for building things. Spreadsheets, data extraction, reports, anything structured.\n* **Deep research** goes back to Perplexity, with Gemini as a backup. Gemini sounds smart but half the time it's just word vomit. Sophisticated language, zero actionable takeaway. I've tested this across hundreds of complex prompts (USPAP, asset management, market analysis) and it's consistent.\n* **GPT**? Can't even use it anymore. I used to love it. Now that I know what each tool is actually good at, there's just no reason to open it.\n\nI've tried simplifying the stack, dropping Perplexity, consolidating. Doesn't work. Once you stop fighting these tools and just lean into what each one does best, everything clicks. They start working for you instead of against you.\n\nOn the API side, we've gone deep: Claude handles our codebase, Perplexity powers research, GPT fills in the gaps. For structured responses, Perplexity wins hands down. From a valuation standpoint, it's been a game changer.\n\nI know Perplexity catches heat for certain things. But man, they've gotten a lot right. My two cents guys! Hopefully someone else can agree, they may not be perfect, but dang they've done some good stuff!",

          "text": "I’m sorry but if you have the highest tier for Gemini, Claud and ChatGPT then perplexity Max is not necessary. \n\nFor starters, you mentioned that for research, Perplexity works, but what type of research are you talking about? I agree that Perplexity is great for quick Google searches, definitions, quick fact-checking, and stuff like that or quick answers. But anything else, it's not as thorough, and its source selection is not as accurate and credible as Gemini and ChatGPT.\n\nAnd saying \"can't even use\" ChatGPT anymore because there's just no reason to \"open\" it. It just means you have not used ChatGPT to its fullest potential. Especially on the Pro plan. Try doing deep research with GPT 5.2 Pro model or GPT 5.2 Heavy Thinking. It's so much of a difference than regular deep research even in Gemini and especially in Perplexity. It's much better than those.\n\nNow Gemini Ultra is great for deep research because it shows nice infographics and organizes it nicely, and it has a nice layout to it. Gemini Ultra gives you the most features and quite frankly, use cases and usage limits out of all the high-end subscription tiers. But I have not heard anyone using Perplexity for deep research or research over Gemini or ChatGPT. Again, Perplexity is a great tool, but not for deep research or research. It's great for quick fact-checking, Google searches, small searches, stuff like that. So if they will use Google for everyday searches, Perplexity can be a replacement for that.\n\nAnd again, I've said this probably 30 times by now in this thread and this subreddit that you do not have access to all the models and Perplexity. You have access to a limited weekend version of those models with a limited content with a very small context window that a system prompted by Perplexity within the confines of Perplexity search deep research, and it's not that model itself at its fullest capacity and capability. So getting Gemini 3 Pro in Perplexity or GPT 5.2 thinking in Perplexity is not the same as getting them on their own respective chatbots. \n\nI would understand if getting the max here in Perplexity would help with Comet because of its usage limits. That would make sense, but Claude max is also a waste of money as well because it runs out because his usage limits are far inferior to ChatGPT Pro and Gemini ultra.\n\nNow you said you code, for coding it makes sense. \nBut I'm just talking generally, besides Gemini Ultra and ChatGPT Pro. If you have those two, you don't need anything else. Honestly, now, if you don't want to pay that much for subscriptions, then I will still get Gemini Pro Chat and ChatGPT Pro, and then throw in Perplexity Pro. But ChatGPT Pro, I think it's an essential in the high-end subscription tiers simply because of the usage limits, access to the pro model, and the fact that it would essentially help you make ChatGPT others yours. Your go-to for work as well. \n\nBecause think about it, if you're going to have 400 Agentic tasks and 250 deep research queries per month, then why not use ChatGPT Atlas? I've tried this, having ChatGPT Pro with, and then using ChatGPT Atlas is just crazy, and it makes the experience so much better. \n\nMy advice for anyone that wants to get the highest subscription tier for AI and any of these chatbots (besides Gemini ultra and ChatGPT pro), the rest are not worth it now. Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro would get the job done. If you want to have Claude and Perplexity, you don't need their max tiers.",

Google's indexing is the best, and it has access to the best sources and websites. It gives you much longer research reports, better access to sources. It's much more accurate. For instance, asking you to find 20 scholarly articles on your sub-argument for your thesis or on this topic or that topic, it finds you 20. This is very accurate sources, academic sources with the URL link, the full DOI, the full information. But Perplexity can't really do that because of its context window. It's very limited. I guess Perplexity is a good app, but for the preliminary stages of research. I guess brainstorming, and it's great for quick fact-checking definitions. So, for any everyday Google searches you would do, Perplexity is a better replacement.",

                  "text": "\nApologies for the long repeonse in advance.\n\nYes, I have done that experiment, and it's night and day. Truly, the difference is night and day. Again, Perplexity does use those models, but there are a couple of clarifications that are very important: it uses a limited version of that model with a much smaller context window.\n\nPerplexity itself acts in a certain way, so within the confines of Perplexity, let's say with the exact same prompt, if you do a search with Gemini 3 Pro and Perplexity, and use the exact same prompt in Gemini, I use Gemini 3 Pro, you would get different responses, and the one in Gemini itself would be much more thorough, logical, with better reasoning, and more extensive and accurate.\n\nNow, Perplexity is still quite accurate; it's still a great app, but if you're someone who uses AI heavily, I wouldn't rely on Perplexity as your only AI tool, and I would not pay for Perplexity Max because it just doesn't offer anything else. To be honest, already on Perplexity Pro, you get near unlimited pro searches and deep research queries per day (I think it's around 300-600, which is almost unlimited because no one would meet that limit). For Labs, sure, you get much more queries in Perplexity Max, but would you really only pay 10x in price just for more Labs queries alone? Doesn't make sense, does it?\n\nNow, if the perfect city max offered much more, such as double the context window, or improved memory features, or gave you access to features that are special to Perplexity Max alone, then it would make sense.\n\nThe third reason why it's different when you use that specific model in Perplexity and use it in its own native app or interface or chatbot is that going back to the context window is precisely that context matters a lot. The context window matters a lot, and I think of it like the horsepower of AI. There are two exact same cars with the same transmission, same exterior and interior, but one has a horsepower of 1 million tokens, the other has a horsepower of 32,000 tokens. Now you see the difference, don't you? \n\nNow, if you like, I said, if you're looking at Perplexity to be your only AI app and you use AI extensively for your work, for studies, for research, for your business, then I would advise against that. Perplexity would be good as your second, third, or fourth AI tool. It shouldn't be your main. It can be a main tool for the average Joe, for the mom or dad that just wants an AI app for someone that is not tech-savvy. They just want a nice AI app to get answers quickly and information. Yeah, that's good. But ChatGPT is a much better subscription to do plus is a much better subscription than Perplexity Pro. Quite frankly. ChatGPT has improved their web indexing and the accuracy of their sources and just the accuracy of the information gives you and the selection of the sources quite dramatically. For instance, I was writing a research paper and I wanted to quickly fact-check my references. I would never trust ChatGPT, but I did a web search; I just asked a simple question and it uses the Chicago Manual of Styles actual website. Perplexity ChatGPT wouldn't do this a year ago, but now it uses the most accurate website for the information that I needed. That's just one small example. And if you don't want to support OpenAI and you don't like ChatGPT at all, that's fine. \n\nThen the best alternative is Gemini, and quite frankly Gemini Pro, being the same price as ChatGPT plus and Perplexity Pro, is the best subscription to have since it gives you so much. It's deeply integrated into Google Workspace, so you can seamlessly export stuff to Google Slides, Google Docs, you can use it in Gmail, you can use it in YouTube, and it gives you access to NotebookLM Pro, which is the best tool for organizing your notes, research, and building a digital notebook. And in terms of the limits, I believe it's something like 25 deep research queries per day, whereas ChatGPT plus is 25 per month, and 15 of those are limited. Deep research which is like an extended web search. \n\nAnd Google's indexing is the best in the world. They basically wrote the game on the search engine; they've perfected it, and they have access to the best websites and sources. So when you do a web search in Gemini or a deep research, you get access to the best sources and websites and the most accurate information. For instance, the URL links that it gets are real, and they open up to real websites. But on ChatGPT, sometimes that's not the case, even on Perplexity, sometimes that is not the case, and the information could be outdated. \n\nSo, I guess if you really love Perplexity but you're going to use AI for work much more and you want more thorough answers, you want more capability, you want a powerful model, then I would advise you to get Gemini AI Pro and Perplexity Pro. Think of it like an investment. You're going to be spending $50/month, but it's super worth it. You're getting the best of both worlds. You're getting Perplexity with its quick answers, quick web searches, fact-checking, and all those different features and limited access to the different models it offers. And then you're getting Gemini AI where you're getting full access to Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini 3 Thinking, and you get much more thorough reports. It's better for writing. Basically, you get Gemini AI at 100% capacity.",

OpenAI (was a research org) is becoming a massive consumer tech company, betting on ChatGPT's commercial success.\n\nMy Tier 1 AI chat apps: ChatGPT, Perplexity, TypingMind.  \nThese are actual products with clear UX and intentional workflows.\n\nCopilot is a decent app, but the AI experience is surprisingly weaker than ChatGPT. Gemini has excellent models (esp Nano Banana) but the app itself has baffling UX flaws and unclear product direction. (I say this even if Gemini is my daily workhorse)\n\nPerplexity is arguably the best \"wrapper\" on the market.  \nApple, for comparison, is also a ChatGPT wrapper and will effectively be a Gemini wrapper in a couple of months.\n\nPerplexity is beating Google at Google’s own game: search, news, live finance, patents, and academic papers.\n\nUnlike ChatGPT or Gemini, you get Claude on Perplexity. Plus ElevenLabs, Kimi, DeepSeek, and whatever else matters next. It does not need to spend billions chasing SOTA models, so it pours its resources into the product surface. Retrieval, citations, ranking, UX.\n\nThe long term business model is risky. Your Perplexity answer is more expensive than a ChatGPT / Gemini response due to search, retrieval, and citation overhead. But also the AI chat app industry is getting too big to fail.\n\nIf OpenAI, which depends on ChatGPT (or the broader AI industry) crashes, the economy is in trouble.

For example, it’s usually better to ask questions on science limiting to academia than searching through Google Scholar. \n\nMy understanding is that Perplexity can run the search results through other LLMs to do the thinking/reasoning. \n\nI really like Perplexity, though I think they will struggle with profitability and are likely to be acquired.",

I use it for very simple things in my life. Last week I used it three times. First was researching sustainable packaging options for a client deck. Second was comparing standing desks because my back is killing me. Third was learning about heat pumps because I got tired of not understanding what people were talking about. My process is pretty simple. I ask one focused question and let it run. I skim the structure first to see if it's even going in the right direction. Then I open a few of the sources it cites to sanity check that it's not hallucinating. Usually I have one or two follow-up questions to narrow things down. The standing desk research was honestly overkill but I saved the report anyway. The packaging research saved me probably four hours of manual searching. The heat pump thing I just wanted to understand the basics and it worked.",

I have a Perplexity Pro, Gemini Pro, and ChatGPT Plus subscription and wouldn't drop Perplexity or Gemini at this point.

At least once a week he deploys some bug and breaks the service and it becomes unusable for some hours until he notices and manages to get the LLM to fix it.\n\nBut I agree that u shouldn't subscribe on 3 LLM chats.

But over the last two weeks, the quality has been terrible. I went through all the effort of creating new Gems from scratch for my work only to face an extreme drop in quality. Chats which worked fine with 2.5 pro now fail all the time with 3.0 models. Refuses to follow my instructions, keeps lying about using context from previous chats (double checked to see if I had that setting on), ignores uploaded files, and also lies about browsing the web (for which I'm supposed to use AI mode and AI studio? Very poor UX) Surprisingly, I'm getting better performance for gemini models on 3rd party providers like Perplexity than from the provider itself (it is better at recalling info properly in long chats from my experience in the past two weeks). \n\nLuckily, I had set up spaces/projects on Perplexity and claude earlier, so I'm able to continue my work. Cancelling my Gemini sub until they fix this mess, will be using other services till then. Relieved to see that other users are facing this same issue as well. ",

At this point in time, I think the decision should be between Gemini and Perplexity as currently imo Gemini 3 is superior to ChatGPT in just about every way.

If I’m looking for fast information to questions or want to learn things, I use Perplexity with Sonar or Gemini Flash 3.  I use Gemini for image generation or if I want summaries of plots of shows or series.  While perplexity can of course do this too, I think Gemini is better through Gemini platform directly.\n\nIf I had to keep only one though, Perplexity is my current favorite.",

It's not unique to Perplexity - it just gets discussed more loudly here.\n\nThere are things I don't love, like some features being Max-only (the email assistant especially, because it's actually really good).

Maybe if you frequently use the Thinking models is what triggers it?  I don’t think Sonar or Gemini 3 Flash models do though.  I’m also not convinced it’s just not a bug.\n\nThere have been some issues on occasion with model rerouting happening if a model isn’t available for whatever reason, but the model it chooses seems to be fine when that happens. Can always rewrite it in another one.\n\nIf you’re looking to use Perplexity as a chatbot, which isn’t its intended usage, you might run into some issues.  The context window is pretty small and responses are optimized for data retrieval and most of the time limited (but reasonable) output tokens.\n\nFor $20 it’s incredibly worth it.  I’ve considered trying Max but $200 a month is too much.\n\nAs you’ve used perplexity before you would know if it’s the kind of thing you’re looking for.  If it’s not working out for you, try Gemini.  That’s the nice thing about the publicly available AI platforms at the moment, they’re all inexpensive and pretty noncommittal so if something isn’t what you’re after, give something else a try.  I personally wouldn’t consider dropping Perplexity atm, but in fairness also has no intention of dropping Gemini either.  Gemini does have a $10/mo off perk if you’re a Verizon wireless customer, but I’d still get it at full price.  I’d consider dropping ChatGPT but see no real reason to as it’s the first one I ever played around with and was impressed by, and Sora is fun to play around with (even if it’s not all that good compared to some of the things out there).",

If you're throwing massive PDFs (like 200+ pages) at it, Gemini is more reliable from my experience. Perplexity handles CSVs and structured data really well for me, but PDFs that big can be hit or miss.\n\nI don't think Perplexity lacks intelligence - it's more that Gemini is optimized for giant docs and long context, while Perplexity is optimized for thinking + search + comparisons.

Just higher rate limits but the models outputs are worse than my paid plus subscription. The response qualities are very subpar. To test it, I made the exact same queries on both the free go and paid plus plans. Created the exact same projects in both of these plans. I consistently faced issues in getting hallucinated responses, models not reading my uploaded files properly. \n\nOn the other hand, I get much much better models on the free Gemini plan  (3.0 and nano banana), don't really see any differences in output responses compared to the paid plan (except for a degradation in the deep research quality). I mainly use Gemini 3.0 for coding and generating media. \n\nLikewise for Perplexity pro through Airtel, even though I do have reduced rate limits (which I have seen in multiple subreddits), the quality seems easily better than Chatgpt go's responses for me. But the fact that I get a wide range of models (sonnet, even opus 4.5 for a while) is really worth it. For all web research related purposes, it is my go to now. Their research mode consistently outperforms Gemini's deep research for me (as stated above, this started happening in the last few days only, looks like Gemini is throttling their Deep research, it used to be better before)\n\n",

The email basically says \"prove you're legit or stay on free plan\" and asks for like 5 different documents.\n\nHonestly feels like they can't just turn off the promo code itself, so they're nuking entire accounts instead.

The burden of users claiming fake offers or using VPNs or workarounds should not be placed on innocent accounts just because Perplexity fails to conduct a proper investigation. \n\n\nIf this is how they respond to people using their service, then I recommend switching to another AI.

A month without hearing anything from a company that was releasing almost weekly updates is odd this far past the holidays, in my opinion.\n\nMy two cents are (1) it's either related to a possible acquisition or (2) it's related to an ongoing or potential lawsuit. They've been receiving a lot of heat from Amazon over the Comet assistant, which became legal action just this past November.\n\nThey do have a major recent lawsuit put against them from The Times on Dec. 5th, claiming Perplexity ignored robots.txt and generated outputs identical or substantially similar to its content. The timing is more than a little coincidental. I will also mention we heard this same argument raised against OpenAI when they first came on the scene and that legal action is still ongoing. Dying media is going to attack whoever they perceive as a threat to their profit margin. If people are not clicking through to view their page, then they're not seeing their ads, which constitutes a loss of revenue.\n\nAll this is to say, my educated guess is that this is probably due to legal issues.",

          "text": "I read your entire post, and from what I understand, you're complaining about a service you didn't even pay for, and you're trying to justify it by saying that if it were worth $20/month, you would do it. \"It's not worth $20/month, therefore I cheat, and I use different emails and codes.\" You're still complaining, you're not paying for this in any way, so you have no right to complain. Also, you're saying it's not $20/month that doesn't justify Perplexity Pro, and you would never pay $20/month for it, but then you still use Perplexity Pro. So clearly there is some use case and value in it for you, but you just want it for free while the rest of us are paying. \n\nI've been a Perplexity Pro subscriber since February 2025. After using it for literally 2 hours for free, I subscribed right away. I saw the value in it and could justify paying less than a dollar a day for a great tool like this. I'd consider myself a heavy user, and I usually run about 30-50 queries per day on Perplexity, sometimes even more, and I've never hit a limit. I've never seen a weekly limit, and I've never had one. \n\nNow I'm no bootlicker. I'm not trying to protect Perplexity. I have no say in it, have no incentive, and I don't get paid by them. But I've been a paid user, and I've raised so many criticisms in this subreddit. Now I realize that getting the codes, free trials, or whatnot gives you access to Perplexity Pro, and it is a flaw that after 250 messages in 4 days, you hit a weekly limit.\n\nStill, I don't know if Perplexity knows you are using different emails or whatever. I doubt they do. But again, your criticisms have no merit because you're not a paid user. If you were a paid user, I'd be like, \"Okay, you're paying $20/month for a service for which you should be getting what your money's worth.\" Even if you were a paid member, you have to realize that for $20/month, you're getting access to so much....You have access to multiple different models, about a dozen different features in the Perplexity app, and you have to realize it's precisely because people like you and other people whom they gave annual free subscriptions to that they are running into issues.   \n  \nNow, granted, it might be due to their mismanagement and giving away free subscriptions left and right, and now they're trying to control it and mitigate it. It is costing them a lot. Quite frankly, I don't think Perplexity is making any profits at all, since it's costing them so much to maintain all these different models, and they have increased their user base exponentially over the past two years. But it's because people like you abuse this. There's a set limit for a reason, and AI does cost a lot of money; it's not free. You truly think Perplexity is making any money on the Pro subscriptions? They're really not. They're losing money on pro subscriptions similar to ChatGPT Plus. They only make money on Max subscriptions, and that's maybe less than 10% of the paid subscribers.   \n  \nThe only thing that's keeping them afloat is the Comet browser since it's the only AI browser that truly works and does autonomous AI tasks, and their different partnerships, like with Snapchat or Ronaldo. \n\nGoing back to your point, it sounds like you're a power user because 250 queries in 4 days is about 60 per day. I'm not saying it's your fault you're using a lot, but you are a power user. I'm not trying to justify Perplexity Max and that you should pay 10 times more, but I'm just saying that some of the complaints you're raising are valid. But at the same time, you have to realize that there are so many other people like you who use different emails and get these deals, free trials and annual subscriptions. It ramps up the use case, and it costs Perplexity a lot of money. They truly can't maintain it, which is why you're seeing the weekly limit. And you, being a power user, are complaning even when you scam your way and create fake emails to get \"pro\". It's just so ironic, and the audacity is crazy.",

I swear I would use labs 5 times a day, and after a couple of days, if the number was still in the same range or reset. \n\nYou stated in one of your comments that \"BESIDE, I'm not the one offering hundreds of thousands of free pro subscriptions to everyone, it's Perplexity that does that  \nIf they are losing money because of people who use them, then they just need to stop making them, then they won't lose money anymore and start being a good product again.\"\n\nThis is quite telling, and by your logic, just because they offer it, you should abuse it, take advantage of it and ruin it for the rest of us. That's like saying, \"Oh, it's not my fault that the bank is giving easy loans, for example. Therefore, I got 20 different loans with different fake businesses and scammed my way through them. It's the flaw of the system.\" \n\nThey're doing a crackdown now on the free trials and the annual memberships they gave away precisely because people like you. You're ruining it for everyone else. Right now, I have Perplexity Pro for $5/month because I'm a university student with my university validating my university email. I got a huge discount. But this is for one year only. When that ends, I'm not going to create another email and try to scan my way through.\n\nThe difference is that if you are a paid subscriber, you can email Perplexity support to raise your concerns, and they will reply right away. But you don't have that option because you are getting your free trial with a different email, and you are still complaining. Honestly, you should be grateful that you can create different emails and use them through this loophole.",

Some users don’t notice this and keep running into bad answers from “best”\n\nThen about 3 convo in it stops searching the web for some reason \n\nOG users would know Deep Research is nerfed. It used to go for 60 + sources. \n\nIt also writes very briefly too. \n\nThis deterioration in UX is coming from cost cutting. \n\nIt’s still the best at web search but recently competitors have caught up. If you are doing simple searchers perplexity is redundant. If you are coding heavy you might as well cancel to subscribe to Claude which is doing so well now\n\nIf perplexity doesn’t get its shit together for web search I’m afraid there’s no reason to sub to it anymore. It’s not exactly cheap tbh. I blame it on their growth strategy trying to onboard a bunch of free pro users which ruined their unit cost and thus have to penalized everyone.",

True thing is that the quality of the answer is strictly depending on the quality of the prompt but it's also true that Research quality has dropped.\n\nExample: I have a space with a strict set of instructions and a file with a set of formatting rules for the output. Advanced models (like Claude Sonnet) can do the task AND adhere to the rules without problems in search mode, while using the same prompt in Research mode means that 99 times on 100 it will ignore part or the whole instructions or it will say that some file on the shared files of the space don't exist (they are there and search finds them pretty easily).\n\nNow, from a few days, research also will refuse to use python most of the times while advanced models do complex tasks with python without issues.\n\nFrankly, I think that the problem stays in the middle: the user should use correct prompts and some of the models like Research have issues.",
