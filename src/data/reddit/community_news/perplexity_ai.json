      "text": "I mainly use Chatgpt to do my research, and then generate dashboards or simple webapps to visualise data through canvas. I recently got access to Perplexity pro, ( I use it daily as a general purpose search engine replacement for google) . I have still been using chatgpt for deeper research/visualising data, since everyone says it's the best deep research tool right now - So I put it to the test against Perplexity labs (which seems to combine deep research + building apps) , by running a few same prompts on each other- The results were quite surprising to me.\n\nSharing one such example here - \"Create a simple app of full fight analysis stats of the main/co-main events of the latest UFC event, use canvas tool\"\n\nRan the same above query in both the tools (modified the perplexity prompt a bit since the webapp color scheme was not my favourite)\n\nResults\n\nChatGPT's research capabilities seemed very subpar compared to Perplexity Labs' research capabilities (consistent with results for other queries too for me), if we're talking about retrieving fresh data consistently - we compare only the main/co-main events and the quality of the dashboard (since that's what I wanted, clearly specific in main prompt + follow up)\n\nChatgpt missed on so much of the important stats - Head strikes, Body strikes, Leg strikes. If we see the dashboard for the main event (the Gaethje fight), The round by round analysis is very bad with so many Null values in the UI. Perplexity's report is definitely cleaner, shows whatever chatgpt showed (significant strikes) + other stats properly (takedown attempts, control time)\n\nFor the co main event (O Malley fight) - Chatgpt failed terribly here, despite chatgpt's deep research running for much longer than Perplexity Labs, showed very less important data compared to Perplexity. No round by round breakdown present at all whereas Perplexity Labs showed all important stats like significant strikes, takedowns, control time - round by round (along with head/body/leg strikes , like it did for the main event)\n\nLabs does seem to be outperforming Chatgpt DR here (from running a few queries today), but can't decide with a small sample space, will continue testing it thoroughly and share more results here. What has your experience been with these features so far? Interested to hear them out\n\nLinks if anyone's interested\n\nChatGPT Deep research Links -\n\nhttps://chatgpt.com/canvas/shared/69763d1aeeec8191a808091339d0589e\n\nhttps://chatgpt.com/share/69763ae2-7afc-8012-a648-8522731bae29\n\nPerplexity labs Link -\n\nhttps://www.perplexity.ai/search/create-a-simple-app-of-full-fi-EDHnzY.UQ5iJT4J_gGSDDA#0",

Still excellent at filtering, problem-solving, and idea generation. Also, since it's referencing by searching the net and detailing which websites they have, it is the best in transparency like Grok.\n\n**Z.ai:** Coding god. Also, since you can have unlimited conversation, currently it is best. Also, there is no restriction on the size or length of the prompt, which is amazing. Too bad we cannot integrate it with Cursor.\n\n**Perplexity:** It is amazing at getting correct references and background checks for articles. Best for references.\n\n**Grok:** Amazing at problem-solving and making sure that the prompt is well understood from the user's perspective.\n\n**For coding purposes:** Claude >> Grok > [z.ai](http://z.ai/) \\> DeepSeek > ChatGPT\n\n**For cover letter, resume:** Claude > Grok > [z.ai](http://z.ai/) \\> ChatGPT\n\n**For reference:** Perplexity >>>>> Claude >>>>>>>> DeepSeek\n\nWhat do you think?

      "text": "EDIT: so in the end, it's anything but a \"quick\" review, sorry about that 😁\n\nTLDR: Perplexity Max is a whole different product and Pro plan looks really poor when you've tried Max.\n\nSo I decided recently to jump and try the Max plan at least for one month because I'm one of the few users that really enjoy using Perplexity Pro and do so absolutely non stop to look for answers for pretty everything.\n\nLet's start with the stuff that is not great since it's $200 bucks :\n\n\\- No GPT pro searches/GPT deep searches\n\n\\- No selection for thinking/reasoning Low-Medium-High-Extra high.\n\n\\- Context is lower than on official apps. But I never had issues with that one.\n\n\\- No coding app so it's can't 100% replace Claude Code or GPT Codex. But I understand this would be way too expensive.\n\n\\- Labs is still a useless mess. This product shouldn't exist like this. They should either revamp it or discontinue it.\n\n\\- Comet assistant is powerful (certainly using better models like Sonnet or GPT when needed) but I find that the Agent is still a gimmick. Still doesn't really know where to clic, taking useless screenshots to find solutions, and so on... But it's pretty ok at multi tab searching (looking for data by opening multiple tabs).\n\nNow besides those, my experience so far goes miles beyond my expectations. I don't even understand why they don't communicate more about it. Probably because Pro would look like shit compared to Max?\n\n\\- First of all : I have been doing 10 days of INTENSIVE vibe coding and research. Meaning, hundreds (more than a thousand?) of Opus 4.5 thinking requests with dozens of heavy documents, dozens of thousands of lines of code. Not a single time did I get a limit. No plan I know would offer me that besides Claude Max $200 plan. Opus 4.5 is beyond expensive and this is incredible. Most of my requests cost probably much more than $1 in API usage.\n\n\\- Quality of Opus 4.5 Thinking vs the official Claude app? Equal if not superior. I spent a few hours doing benchmarks because that was my biggest fear: I asked GPT to craft prompts for extremely complex technical tasks, then sent the prompt to both Opus 4.5 Thinking models and compared outputs through GPT, Gemini and Opus : the fact that the Perplexity version fetches more data online gives it an advantage. So they don't downgrade Opus.\n\n\\- Deep Research : WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. F. ?! I had completely stopped using Deep Research in Pro because any well prompted search with Gemini 3 Pro or GPT 5.2 Thinking was giving a way better quality output than Deep Research that was just an hallucinating joke. On Max, it pulls at least 10x the number of sources it did in Pro, on average 60 to 100 sources. With a good prompt it's transforming into the most powerful AI research tool I've seen when you are looking for granular data. You get HUGE reports and I didn't see any hallucinations, sources have nothing to do with the ones from the Pro search. If you look for a very specific information, it will find it. It most certainly doesn't use the same cheap model to search the sources. Probably at least Sonnet, maybe Opus. And it creates beautiful presentations. What Labs should be able to do. It's vastly superior to Gemini Deep Research and for most tasks it's better than GPT Deep research but I would't know for research papers, I didn't try nor compare.\n\n\\- Sources quality : multiple sources with professional, scientific or financial data that are expensive and available for Max users.\n\n\\- Unlimited image generation is useful, especially when you can prompt \"generate 15 images with various clothes\" and you'll get them.\n\nMy heart would balance between Claude Max and Perplexity because for $200 Claude Max tier you get a huge Claude Code quota. But you don't get to use the other models and it's very useful to me to be able to jump from Opus to GPT, to Gemini, and so on, when I need different types of answers from a variety of models.\n\nI'll finish with the KILLER feature for me: Spaces in Perplexity, especially Perplexity Max, are impossible to beat. I've tried everything with GPT, Claude, Gemini... nothing is as good as the spaces. I'm adding dozens of documents, saving chats as files for context keeping, doing some research and saving it into relevant spaces, adding links like Github repos: when I open a chat window in a space, I already know that the model is going to deep dive in the context, go through my entire GitHub, scrap through dozens, or even a hundred links at light speed. This is pure power.\n\nNow my typical workflow is research, brainstorming by using the best data available and then opening a PR on GitHub through my Perplexity chat. All with Opus 4.5 Thinking, obviously. It's incredibly powerful and convenient. Only the GitHub access is slow, or the process to work with GitHub. You have to wait a long time to press Approve for each change. No agentic features and Comet refuses to approve changes to GitHub automatically for security reasons.\n\nSo yeah, sorry it's a very long post but it's been a few days now that I wanted to share my experience for people curious about Max.\n\nIt's a bit sad for Pro users because I can see now how the Pro tier is \"bad\" compared to Max. It's still worth it for free or if people really want to be able to use the nice UI, good UX with memory and access to multiple models easily.\n\nAgain, I don't understand how Perplexity doesn't communicate better about Max power. I hope they don't nerf it because I don't see how they can make money... Anyway, it's going to be hard for me to go back to pro. But it's very costly, which is normal for what you get, except Labs...\n\nAny Max brothers out there, feel free to share your experience and usage. I'm sure there are plenty of ways to use all that unlimited (?) power!",

Whatever margin they could make from monthly pro users who weren’t costing them $20 worth of electricity...  It’s pennies compared to the enterprise & max subs. Their business has the best path to profit if the subscription is largely bought and forgot - which is much more likely to be the case when the user isn’t the one footing the monthly bill for it (enterprise employees). Or when the individual user is willing to blow $200 and not spam claude opus & deep research enough to cost $200.",

I paid for a year of Pro (runs out in June) but with this new limitation, the service has become useless for my purposes.  \n\nI contacted support and asked two questions - when will my paid service be restored, and how can I see the limitation so I can keep myself under it (essential use only).  Support could not give me an answer to either question, which is totally unacceptable. \n\nThis is a bait and switch to provide a level of paid service and then take it away suddenly, and not be able to even tell someone when the paid service will be restored.  \n\nIn any case, since the service is now not meeting my needs, I need an alternative. I only have two requirements:\n\n1. Something that also searches the Internet and provides good references when asked.  Perplexity almost never hallucinates or provides references that don't exist.  I need something like that.\n2. I need to be able to upload documents and images, and have it be able to analyze them.  For example, one of my use cases is for a business; I have all of the details of the business in a Master Brief so I don't have to keep reminding Perplexity what it is, and then I ask it various questions.  Sometimes I'm uploading many documents at a time (although not usually, although through each query, as we go through a sequence of things, I might upload more documents).  Also yesterday, I used it for something personal - I am moving, and wanted it to figure out the best configuration for my furniture (and whether the colors matched, etc) so I was uploading floorplans and pictures.  This is when I hit the limit yesterday, in fact.  \n\nWhat else meets my needs?  There is no way I'm upgrading to \"Max\" at that price - it's exponentially higher than Pro, and not realistic for me. \n\n",

          "text": "TL:DR - most other big competitors don’t fill the role exactly like Perplexity does, with every AI having different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nNot many other AIs are good at what perplexity does 🫤\n\nI don’t talk to AI about my day, but mainly school help and random questions that pop up throughout the day. \n\nI’ve noticed ChatGPT is by far the worst AI *for my needs*, it’s too chatty, tries to act like a friend, and isn’t as good at calculus 2-3 compared to Gemini or Claude Sonnet/Opus. If you like to talk and “brain storm” (Gemini is alright at brain storm, Claude/opus isn’t really meant for that), then ChatGPT would be the best\n\nGemini is great for math and reasoning, it’s coding aspects are alright (their good enough for my data science classes and I’m still early in), but it isn’t that great for factual search’s (ChatGPT isn’t either though), for example, I was playing a very niche board game, and decided to ask the AI the difference between building a white city and a red city in the board game I was playing. It very confidently said the most random thing, and gave no source to back it up (while perplexity got it right on the first try, using 17 sources). It still does searches if you ask it (example, I asked Gemini if SurfShark VPN has a “log out on all other devices” action on their app or website - Gemini/ChatGPT/Perplexity/Grok got it correct, while the Anthropic models were very wrong -I’ve noticed they suck at searching the web). Gemini is still good for me because it is good at math, especially with the “guided learning” feature\n\nSurprisingly, Grok has actually been the closest to Perplexity 🫩, it’s also the most expensive and doesn’t have the best person behind the name, but it’s still good regardless. When I asked the board game question, Grok also got it right, using 42 sources for its answer, and being decently quick, however it’s also very quick in general. I had a 100 question exam, and out of Gemini, Grok, and Perplexity - Grok was able to read the screen shot and answer the question as I submitted it, which was stupidly fast compared to Gemini 3 flash and perplexity. Part of the reason I haven’t switch over tho is because it seems to be “okay” at reading images. I asked it to compare to custom PC parts, and it kept reading “RTX 3080” as “RTX 3060”, even though the screen shot wasn’t blurry, so I’m not sure what happened, but so far, that might be what I permanently switch to (factual sources, better at coding then Gemini - still under opus tho, and very very good at math), Grok can be chatty, but not as bad as ChatGPT.\n\nClaude sonnet was nice, and it’s memory system is actually very cool, I really wanted to like it, and it was very good at math and reasoning problems, but it just can’t search the web (it does search, but it’s very brief and doesn’t respond well), that was my main turn down, it’s great at everything else tho (not as chatty). Oh, sometimes it can be too nit picky. I work at Best Buy as a sales advisor, and quickly asked Claude sonnet the difference between the switch 1 and switch 2, and then it asked me like 3 questions before it gave an answer (“are you talking about the “Nintendo switch 1 and 2” or a physical set of switches labeled 1 and 2), grok was cool because when you typed the question, it gives a 5 word summary of the answer before answering (example: bigger screen, joycons, new games).\n\nBased off all of this info, none of these purely replace perplexity (I’ve only hopped around the main competitors, not trying minstral, you.com, or others). Based on my needs,  grok seems to come close for fact based answers and strong math, but idk what’d fit you based on these descriptions\n\nEdit - TLDR",

Verify every claim with a Google Search and provide citations').\n\nBut for the heavy lifting, I’ve started using Gemini’s Deep Research. It’s not instant—it takes a few minutes to build a plan and execute—but it digs much deeper and actually verifies the data. If you need accuracy over speed for a real project, it’s a much more viable alternative right now. \n\nWhat is sad is I really have enjoyed Perplexity Pro. Their Business / Strategy team has really hurt what was a great product. \n\nThere is no such thing as a free lunch. All of these free plans have fallen into the lap of the paid customers.  \n\nI keep vacillating between delete and don’t delete with the hope they will get it together. I spot use it but not like I regularly did a month or so ago. \n\nAlso, Claude Sonnet/OPUS is incredible but you hit session and maxes and have to restart chats with summary of the previous chat. I am working some non-coding things right now and OPUS 4.5 is crazy good as is Sonnet 4.5 on lesser tasks.",

If your requirements are dependable internet search with verifiable references and the ability to upload and analyze a bunch of documents and images as you iterate (business briefs, floorplans, photos, sequences of uploads), I'd seriously consider Spellbook, AI Lawyer, CoCounsel as a Perplexity alternative. The vibe is less chat toy and more document-first workflow, which matters when your whole use case is sustained context across many files. You can still keep using what you already paid for until June, but having a backup that doesn't make you guess at invisible limits can save you a lot of time and frustration.",

      "text": "I had to go into their policies and to find what changed.\n\n# Overview of Perplexity Terms of Service Changes (January 23, 2026)\n\nPerplexity updated its Terms of Service with significant changes that particularly impact Pro and Education Pro users through expanded restrictions on commercial use, automation, and output usage.\n\n---\n\n## Major Restrictions for Pro Users\n\n### Commercial Use Limitations\n\n- **Personal, non-commercial use only**: Despite \"Pro\" branding suggesting professional/business capabilities, the Terms explicitly restrict usage to personal, non-commercial purposes\n- **No commercial exploitation**: Users cannot exploit the service for any commercial purpose, including facilitating advertisements or solicitations\n- **No revenue-generating activities**: Using Pro for business operations, client work, or any monetized workflow is prohibited\n- **No production business infrastructure**: Pro cannot serve as the backbone of commercial operations or automated business systems\n\n### Automation and Access Restrictions\n\n- **No bots or scrapers**: Complete ban on bots, scrapers, crawlers, or other automation software to access or modify the service\n- **No automated queries**: Scripted usage and automated data extraction are explicitly prohibited\n- **No mass data mining**: Queries designed to scrape or mass-extract data are not allowed\n- **No API-like usage**: Automated workflows that hammer the service are restricted, even if technically functional\n\n### Output Usage Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory attribution**: All published output must clearly cite that it comes from Perplexity's AI services\n- **No misrepresentation**: Users cannot represent AI-generated content as human-created\n- **Citation required for public use**: Any public-facing or business-facing content using output needs explicit AI attribution\n- **No silent embedding**: Cannot quietly integrate outputs into reports, listings, or client-deliverables without disclosure\n\n### Professional Advice Limitations\n\n- **Not for professional decisions**: Output explicitly cannot replace medical, legal, financial, or investment advice\n- **No reliability guarantee**: Content is acknowledged as potentially incorrect, biased, or incomplete\n- **User assumes all risk**: Strong liability limitations push risk onto users for any decisions based on outputs\n- **Maximum liability capped**: Perplexity's liability limited to greater of $100 or six months of payments\n\n---\n\n## Key Changes Summary\n\n### 1. AI Input/Output Requirements\n\n- Users must explicitly cite that published output comes from Perplexity's AI services and cannot misrepresent it as human-generated content\n- Users are fully responsible for ensuring they have rights to all inputs and must not prompt the system to generate outputs violating intellectual property, contracts, or laws\n- Clarification added that multiple users can independently generate similar or identical outputs from similar inputs\n\n### 2. Service Use Restrictions\n\n- Explicit limitation to \"personal, non-commercial use only\" with clear prohibition on exploiting services for commercial purposes\n- New ban on bots, scrapers, crawlers, or automation software to access, modify, or extract data from the service\n- Mass data extraction and automated queries are now explicitly prohibited\n\n### 3. Liability and Disclaimer Updates\n\n- Strong emphasis that AI outputs can be incorrect, biased, or incomplete and should not replace professional advice (medical, legal, financial, investment)\n- Services provided \"AS IS / AS AVAILABLE\" with maximum liability capped at the greater of $100 USD or amounts paid in the last six months\n- Broad warranty disclaimers implemented across all service offerings\n\n### 4. Arbitration and Dispute Resolution\n\n- New detailed arbitration clause with class action waiver requiring mandatory informal dispute resolution before arbitration\n- Users can opt out of arbitration provisions within 30 days of first registering or agreeing to terms (but cannot opt out of class-action waiver only)\n- Exceptions remain for small claims court, pure injunctive relief, and intellectual property claims\n\n### 5. Shopping with Perplexity Pro (ProShop)\n\n- New section describing ProShop functionality where Perplexity facilitates purchases from third-party merchants but is not the seller\n- Clarifies that transactions occur between users and merchants; Perplexity advances funds on behalf of users then debits linked payment methods\n- Disputes, cancellations, returns, and refunds are governed by merchant policies, not Perplexity\n- Includes release of claims against Perplexity for merchant disputes with specific California Civil Code 1542 waiver\n\n### 6. Content Licensing and Data Usage\n\n- User content license (including inputs) is now explicitly broad, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide, and irrevocable while stored\n- License grants Perplexity rights to operate, improve, and provide services, including sharing with contracted third parties where necessary\n\n### 7. Beta Features Risk Framework\n\n- Stronger warnings that beta features are provided \"as is\" and may irreversibly corrupt or alter user data\n- Clarification that reverting from beta features may not restore content created during beta participation\n\n---\n\n## Impact Assessment by Use Case\n\n### Education Pro Users\n\n**Allowed Activities:**\n\n- Coursework, assignments, and academic projects\n- Research and independent study\n- Personal skill-building and learning\n- Non-monetized portfolio work\n- Case studies and mock analyses for classes\n\n**Restricted Activities:**\n\n- Using education access for actual business operations\n- Automated systems tied to revenue generation\n- Client work or paid consulting using the service\n- Production dashboards or business-critical workflows\n- Any commercial exploitation of the education license\n\n### Pro Subscription Users\n\n**Allowed Activities:**\n\n- Personal research and exploration\n- Individual learning and skill development\n- Creating content for personal use with proper attribution\n- Light analysis for personal decision-making (with understanding of limitations)\n\n**Restricted Activities:**\n\n- Business intelligence pipelines\n- Commercial content creation\n- Automated trading systems or market analysis tools\n- Resale business operations and product research\n- Client-facing work or deliverables\n- Any form of commercial automation or scraping\n- Using outputs for professional advice without independent verification\n\n### Power Users and Developers\n\n**Major Impacts:**\n\n- Cannot build automated integrations or bots on top of the service\n- Cannot create production workflows that rely on service access\n- Cannot use scripted access for high-volume queries\n- Must move commercial/automated use cases to API or Enterprise plans with explicit commercial terms\n- Risk of account termination for ToS violations, even on paid plans\n\n---\n\n## Compliance Requirements\n\nTo remain compliant with the updated terms, Pro users must:\n\n1. **Attribution**: Clearly label and attribute all AI-generated content when published\n2. **Personal Use Only**: Restrict usage to genuinely personal, non-commercial activities\n3. **No Automation**: Avoid automated access, scraping, or bot-based interactions\n4. **Risk Acknowledgment**: Understand outputs are not reliable for professional decision-making in regulated fields\n5. **Arbitration Decision**: Review and potentially opt out of arbitration provisions within 30 days\n6. **Commercial Separation**: Keep any business/revenue-generating activities on separate services with appropriate commercial licensing\n\n---\n\n## What Changed for Pro Users Specifically\n\n### Before January 23, 2026:\n\n- \"Pro\" branding implied professional/business usage capability\n- Terms were less explicit about commercial restrictions\n- Automation usage existed in gray area\n- Attribution requirements were less stringent\n- Liability and disclaimer language was less comprehensive\n\n### After January 23, 2026:\n\n- Explicit \"personal, non-commercial use only\" restriction applies to all tiers including Pro\n- Clear prohibition on commercial exploitation regardless of subscription level\n- Comprehensive ban on automation, bots, and scripted access\n- Mandatory attribution for all published outputs\n- Detailed arbitration requirements with 30-day opt-out window\n- New ProShop functionality with merchant relationship disclaimers\n- Stronger liability caps and warranty disclaimers\n\n### The Core Tension:\n\nThe \"Pro\" subscription name suggests professional/business capabilities, but the Terms of Service explicitly restrict all usage (including Pro tiers) to personal, non-commercial purposes. This creates significant misalignment between user expectations and legal permissions, particularly affecting users who subscribed specifically for business use cases.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations for Different User Types\n\n### Academic Users (Education Pro):\n\n- Continue using for genuine coursework and learning\n- Keep all usage within academic context\n- Avoid repurposing academic projects for commercial ventures\n- Label any published work as AI-assisted\n\n### Business/Commercial Users (Pro):\n\n- Evaluate whether usage truly qualifies as \"personal, non-commercial\"\n- Consider migrating business-critical workflows to API or Enterprise plans\n- Separate personal research from commercial operations\n- Ensure proper attribution on all public-facing outputs\n\n### Automation/Developer Users:\n\n- Immediately cease automated access not explicitly permitted\n- Review alternative services with clear API and automation terms\n- Plan migration for production systems built on Perplexity\n- Contact sales for Enterprise or API licensing if commercial use is needed\n\n### Individual Researchers/Analysts:\n\n- Continue personal research within bounds\n- Add clear attribution to published work\n- Understand and accept reliability limitations\n- Avoid treating outputs as professional advice without verification\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Restriction Categories\n\n| Restriction Category | Status |\n|:---------------------|:-------|\n| Commercial Use | PROHIBITED |\n| Automation/Bots | PROHIBITED |\n| Scraping/Mass Data Extraction | PROHIBITED |\n| Revenue-Generating Activities | PROHIBITED |\n| Business Infrastructure Use | PROHIBITED |\n| Professional Advice Reliance | PROHIBITED |\n| Output Publishing Without Attribution | PROHIBITED |\n| Misrepresenting AI Content as Human | PROHIBITED |\n\n**Total Major Restrictions: 8 categories**\n\n---\n\n# **UPDATE 1**\n\n**Users banned without explanation or cause:**\n- People banned from Perplexity Discord who never even participated - just lurked\n- When they ask why, they get \"looking into it with the Discord moderation team\" and then silence\n\n**Pro accounts terminated for raising issues:**\n​- Subscriptions cancelled with only \"you violated terms\"- no specifics on which term or how\n- No refunds, no real explanation, no recourse\n\n**Documented censorship on Reddit:**\n- Back in March 2024, Perplexity staff removed negative comments about the platform and banned the poster\n- User posted legitimate criticism about inaccurate responses - comment deleted, user banned\n\n# What This Means\n**They're running the Discord as damage control, not community support. When you:**\n- Point out promised features that don't exist\n- Call out model throttling or quota lies\n- Share evidence of staff dishonesty\n\n**Question why support ignores you**\n...they just delete it and ban you instead of addressing the actual problems.\n\n\n---\n\n# **UPDATE 2....IT GETS WORSE**\n\n# Current Active Lawsuits\n**New York Times - Filed December 5, 2025:**\n- Copyright infringement on millions of articles\n- Trademark violations by falsely attributing fabricated \"hallucinations\" to NYT\n- Bypassed robots.txt and circumvented hard blocks\n- Made 175,000+ unauthorized access attempts in August 2025 alone\n- Seeking statutory damages, profit disgorgement, and permanent injunction\n\n**Chicago Tribune - Filed December 2025:**\n- ​Copyright violations and RAG technology misuse\n- Likely to be consolidated with NYT case\n\n**Dow Jones/Wall Street Journal/New York Post - Filed October 2024:**\n- \"Massive illegal copying\" through scraping\n- \"Skip the Links\" feature that replaces original sources\n- False attribution of hallucinated content to their publications\n- Demanding destruction of databases containing their copyrighted works\n\n**Reddit - Filed October 2025:**\n- DMCA anti-circumvention violations\n- Set trap content, caught Perplexity accessing it hours later\n\n**Amazon - Cease and desist November 2025:**\n- ​Legal threats over AI shopping agent functionality\n\n\n\n# What's Coming\n**Given what they're doing in Discord and to paid users, they're exposed to:**\n- Consumer protection violations: Promising features/quotas they don't deliver, terminating paid accounts without cause or refund\n\n**Breach of contract:** Pro users paying for \"unlimited\" or specific quotas, getting throttled to 20-30 uses when promised 600\n​\n\n**False advertising:** Discord staff promising features that don't exist (unlimited GPT Imagen generations = actually 10/day)\n​\n\n**Potential class action:** Over 40 AI copyright cases active nationwide - consumer fraud class action is logical next step\n​\n\nThey're censoring critics in Discord because they know the evidence is damning. Every deleted message, every banned user calling out broken promises - that's documentation for litigation.",

Consequently, I received a refund for an order payment processed the day prior to this change, which was an automatic renewal. Subsequently, users confirmed that the limit had reverted to 600, its previous state. This led me to re-subscribe to the Pro membership, confirming the reinstatement of the 600 limit. However, within a day, the limit unexpectedly changed again, this time to 200. This lack of transparency regarding such alterations is profoundly frustrating, especially when no official announcements are made.",

I mean Know how much messages you get for what you pay :)\n\n[**New Perplexity Query Limit tool**](https://update.greasyfork.org/scripts/507664/Perplexityai%20Limits%20Overlay%20%28Dark%20Mode%2C%20Draggable%29.user.js)\n\nIts a user-script that works with violentmonkey/tampermonkey  \nGet the extension -> click on the link -> install the script\n\nI'm still not fully sure how this new limit works for now but my best guess from my observations those last 2 days is that when you take a pro subscription, you get a pool with a specific amount of queries across all models, I think it's 300 queries total  \nAnd when you use those queries, the pool empty itself...  \nThen you get **one query back every 1 hour**\n\nSo to make it clear, as of today for **20$ per month** for a pro sub, you get a total of 300 messages + 24 messages per day  \n(Btw, before today you could still get unlimited messages with sonar and non thinking grok as they are dirt cheap to run. Not anymore, they both count like the big models, limited to 1 every hour)\n\nI would normally complain about it, get angry and all that, but I'm sure some people here will still find a way to defend them... some even accusing me of working for the competition since I always complain and attack perplexity (wonder who would be competition since perplexity buy API from all models provider so make them lots of money, and there is no other platform like perplexity, but heh...)\n\nSo F this, I'm just here to give you a little tool, make your own opinion on the matter\n\nHave a good day :)\n\n\\-\n\n**Update : They once again broke everything and hide everything so users have no way to know what they pay for...**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49zlrd4wq0gg1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a8dbdf82d2b56eba099b8c992bca13dea276a35\n\nThey broke the method I used to know the number of remaining message  \nI used this [https://www.perplexity.ai/rest/rate-limit/all](https://www.perplexity.ai/rest/rate-limit/all) and took the value \"remaining\\_pro\" to give the number  \nBut they broke it, it is no longer showing the \"advanced AI model\" messages remaining (all model beside grok and sonar)  \nIt's not showing in there either [https://www.perplexity.ai/rest/user/settings](https://www.perplexity.ai/rest/user/settings)\n\nSo once again witness their lack of transparency... they stop you from knowing exactly how many message you have left, what you pay for...\n\nI'm so sick of this bullshit seriously...",

It would at least risk damage to its image or even a contractual penalty. Investors would also start asking questions. \n\nAfter all, Perplexity enters into contractual partnerships with partners such as Airtel for such campaigns, and such a failure on Perplexity's part would ultimately also reflect badly on its cooperation partner which usually also invest money to advertise such promotional campaigns. It is a marketing campaign after all with which Airtel hopes to attract new customers.\n\nSo by stating „fraud“ as the reason to reduce the number of active promo-accounts, they deflect from their own miscalculation and push the blame for the cancellations onto the users without needing to provide proof and Perplexity for sure doesn‘t have to fear any unpleasant questions from its cooperation partners as a result.",
