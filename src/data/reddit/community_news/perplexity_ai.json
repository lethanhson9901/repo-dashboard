One of my prompts has the specific instruction to run Monte Carlo simulations with random sampling. It mostly does that (retrieve the data points for random sampling, write the script to run simulations). However, 9 out of 10 times, it takes shortcuts by doing one of two things:\n\n1. completely ignores the whole random sampling and just uses a gaussian distribution (I explicitly asked for random sampling and explained what I mean by that)\n2. if it does random sampling, it does not take the 24 requested data points, but instead chooses 3-4 and leaves a comment in the code, like `// for example` (despite being prompted to take those exact 24 data points)",

In Claude they list their models with a separate option for  Extended Thinking.

So, someone posted unwanted codes for sale at a fraction of the usual annual subscription price. How did the codes end up on the grey market? Were they 'leaked' directly by partner organisations? Or by individuals who received the codes but did not want them and are trying to make a quick buck?\n\nThere are other cases of similar grey-market practices where such behaviour remains unpunished. For example, reselling bulk corporate Windows activation keys to individual consumers seems to be tolerated by Microsoft, even though, as far as I know, it technically breaches their terms of service. A slightly different situation, I understand, but presumably Perplexity allocated these codes to their partners with the expectation that **some** would not be used; otherwise, it wouldn't be feasible. Is that the issue? More uptake than expected?\n\nPerhaps Perplexity should have designed its promotions to make it harder for people to sell codes on the grey market. 🤷‍♂️\n\nI wouldn't personally take such a risk, but this entire situation appears, at least at first glance, to be a PR mistake that, in hindsight, could have been handled better (if not avoided altogether).",

Prefer fresh coverage; avoid outdated or duplicate stories.  \n- Keep the whole briefing scannable, using bullets and clear section labels.\n\nTo use this as a repeating Task, set the schedule (for example, every day at 7:30 AM) and keep the search window as “past 24 hours” or “since yesterday morning” so you minimize stale items.",

Like that's not free infrastructure they're running in a garage. $20/month for access to multiple frontier models with web search is already kind of absurdly cheap. ChatGPT Plus is the same price and you only get OpenAI models. Claude Pro is the same and you only get Anthropic models. Perplexity gives you both plus a bunch more tailored for research and other knowledge work...probably even better with the knowledge council.  \n  \nI'm not saying the product is perfect. But product and communication is a different issue from \"I can't do unlimited Deep Research on a plan that costs less than my Netflix subscription.\" Some of the expectations in here are wild.",

As a (now former) customer this again is a deal breaker unto itself. The fact that they're having to scramble and keep changing the agreement Darth-at-Bespin style does not engender confidence and make me want to give them more money. Is the need for profitability mixed with the increasing hard costs their FAULT? No. But the complete mismanagement of their customers definitely is. And even outside of that, the realities of their business model are definitely their PROBLEM.\n\nThis is just a case of fiscal reality catching up with a pipe dream of a business model and their complete failure to manage it from a product, marketing, and public relations perspective.",

Make Files and Apps has also improved a lot, far better end results, better files again for the non internal files, although to be honest it takes about as long to fill in a template as it does to get Perplexity to do a full on report, so sometimes manual is the answer.\n\nWe also had the referral scams people were pulling trying to make a living out of it, how people didn't see this = abuse of terms and conditions is beyond me. I also notice when the people are ripping off the company, getting more than they paid for, and generally trying to use unlawful subscriptions and then complain when it's stopped via a change in service.\n\nI am very irritated about the cuts, but I am also very pragmatic and appreciate that I am still actually getting a good deal and a good service, (no service is perfect) as the people say we get multiple frontier level AI models, and I have found a way that's no too painful to remain within my subscription, when the business takes off I can justify paying the $200 a month.\n\nCurrently most other things I use local AI for, even then Perplexity is often better at the coding and other tasks, ok I am not getting the convenience of the coding specific AI models available online with the UI/UX efficiency but it's still doing the job, not taking much longer than automated now I'm establishing my own agentic type system based on heavy research.",

I think the disconnect stems from personal experience (with yours seemingly vastly superior to others), combined with a lack of transparency re: actual services provided to customers out of the box.\n\n-“20/month for access to multiple frontier models with web search is already kind of absurdly cheap.”\n\nAgree - This sounds like the type of reasonably-priced service (even with limits) many users signed up for, but aren’t receiving - resulting in a very frustrated user base.\n\nAnd again, this is a transparency issue. “Multiple frontier models with web search” has become multiple castrated/quantitated models (which cycle without user notice) with severely limited web search (limited in quality and volume, while hamstrung by excessive waste)\n\n“Deep Research” is clearly a work in progress outside of cherry-picked scenarios, resulting in negative value when tasked to research complex or nuanced topics.  \n\nIn its current state, the “Pro” version of this service is broken for most users. New “Deep Research” limits are representative of the current state of affairs, given the mode’s inability/unwillingness to overcome even minor obstacles and its overall general lack of utility.\n\nAll that being said, if there’s some “secret sauce” you use that sends the platform back in time to a “20/month for access to multiple frontier models with web search” system, that would clearly be a game-changer. \n\nBut as it currently stands, TLDR:\n\nWe are currently living in a time of previously unfathomable progress in the artificial intelligence space. This is the AI era. Moving at a back-breaking pace, the landscape changes daily. The speed of progress continually compounding.\n\nYet one major player in the space is regressing. Intentionally. Because it would be impossible to regress otherwise. \n\nFor $20/month, people expect an absence of intentional regression.",

It's probably the most similar I've had to PPLX. If you download Brave Nightly you can use it completely free as much as u want and select different models. I personally have liked using Deepseek on there. \n\nHuggingface.co has plenty of free options as well. You can even set up transformers for free. I'm yet to do that, but I hear it's very reaourceful. \n\nGrok. Is free and not half bad. With no limits. \n\nBlackbox.ai has a 90 day free trial\n\nDuck.ai is also decent and free\n\nIf you're somewhat tech savvy, you can go on GitHub and spin up Perplexica. Which is an open sourced free alternative as closely resembling perplexity as anything else out there. \n\nYou.com\n\n\nI could go on and on.....try some of these. You gotta use a lil effort and time to knowledgeabley save your PPLX limits. \n\nAnyone with any other suggestions or anything feel Free to add. Point is we have options....PLENTY!!!",

After my free year is up…as long as it doesn’t get considerably worse…I think I’ll be sticking around as well.",

Reselling bulk corporate Windows activation keys to individual consumers, for example, seems to be tolerated by Microsoft, even though it technically breaches their terms of service. Slightly different situation, I understand, but presumably Perplexity allocated these codes to their partners with the expectation that some wouldn't be used, thus making the promotions viable? Is that what the issue is? More uptake than expected?\n\nPerhaps Perplexity should have designed its promotions so that it wouldn't be so easy for people to sell codes on the grey market.\n\nI wouldn't personally take such a risk, but this entire situation appears to be a PR blunder.",

So had it been a more reasonable 50-100 per month cap for “Pro” accounts with a throttle down to around their current 20 for the abusers at most… I highly doubt the public reaction would have had nearly as much whiplash.\n\nThe fact that they overestimated their own capabilities to deal with problems like this and the “goodness” of people shouldn’t be a consequence that suddenly falls on every user that plays within their rules and isn’t actively seeking or selling loopholes & exploits.

The comment essentially said they wouldn’t recommend a yearly plan. Mentioned changing limits, shared that they personally switched to another AI tool. Advised others to be cautious.\n\nIf that comment violates a specific community rule then it should be straightforward to explain which rule. How? So I’m asking the moderators\n\nWhich exact community rule was violated?\n\nWhat specific sentence or behavior triggered the permanent ban?\n\nWas any warning issued before the ban?\n\nIs there an appeal process?\n\nThis is not about one user. It seems like this is ultimately about moderation standards and consistency.\n\nPerplexity\\_ai moderators have stated that this subreddit is not affiliated with the company. If that’s the case hen moderation decisions should be transparent and grounded in clearly defined rules.\n\nCritical posts often get heavily downvoted very quickly. Praise posts rise fast. That may be organic. It may not be. But when bans follow criticism without clear explanation it creates the perception that dissent isn’t welcome here.\n\nThis is a simple request for clarity. If the rule violation is clear and objective posting the explanation would settle this immediately. ",

Saying they switched tools. No links, no spam patterns, no copy paste behavior, no obvious brigading signals…\n\nJust consumer criticism. That is normal activity in any tech subreddit.\n\nIf this were about bots or coordinated harm, mods could simply say so. That would clarify things. Instead, theres been no specific rule cited at all.\n\nSaying “there’s a campaign against Perplexity” doesn’t make every critical comment part of that campaign. That is dangerous assumption. Once criticism is treated as attack by default moderation stops being evidence based.\n\nIf there is proof of coordination, show the category of violation. If there isn’t then this was just a user expressing dissatisfaction. Which should be allowed in any independent non-affiliated subreddit.\n\nTransparency would solve this. Until then bot/attack explanation just doesn’t match the visible facts.\n\n",

      "text": "Heads up to EU users: This isn't about losing a promo subscription, it's about **how** it's being handled. The complete lack of transparency and basic respect for users is the real issue here.\n\nPerplexity appears to be suspending active subscriptions (including promo-based ones from ISP bundles or paypal) without prior notice. When you contact support, you get an AI bot that:\n\n* Refuses to tell you *which* ToS term was supposedly violated\n* Claims the decision is \"final and cannot be appealed\" by anyone, human or AI\n* Won't let you speak to a human\n* Then suggests you can just \"subscribe at regular pricing\" to fix it\n\nThis isn't just bad customer service — it's likely illegal under the **EU Digital Services Act (DSA)**  (https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act)\n\n**Your rights under the DSA:**\n\n* **Article 17:** You're entitled to a *clear, specific statement of reasons* for any account restriction. \"Security reasons\" is not enough.\n* **Article 20:** You have the right to an *internal complaint mechanism* and appeal. A bot telling you the decision is final violates this.\n* **Article 25:** Platforms can't use deceptive interfaces (\"dark patterns\")  like implying a ToS violation can be fixed by paying again.\n\n**What you can do:**\n\nIf this happened to you:\n\n1. **Save your chat logs** (like I did) with the customer service\n2. Send a final message referencing DSA Articles 17, 20, and 25\n3. **File a complaint** with your national Digital Services Coordinator\n\n**Find your country's DSA authority here:**  \n[https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/dsa-dscs#1720699867912-1](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/dsa-dscs#1720699867912-1)\n\n(Scroll down to find your member state's designated authority)\n\nPerplexity is acting like EU consumer law doesn't apply to them. Let's remind them it does. \n\nFor reference, I had the service as an offer via my ISP and it was a couple of months left on my free subscription and was planning to renew with a proper subscription with them but I am moving to Google or Claude instead.

From the dropdown menu select \"Request a Refund\",\n2. a new \"tell us more\" dropdown appears, select \"other\" and click next,\n3. select the perplexity app below (you might have to scroll down a bit), click next,\n4. it takes you to another page with a \"describe the issue\" text box. I included this:\n\nAfter paying for this subscription, the developer unilaterally downgraded core features integral to the service at the time of purchase, specifically usage caps tied to my subscription as advertised. This was done without prior notice or compensation. Failure of Consideration: I am not receiving the service I paid for; the app now provides substantially less value. Violation of App Store Review Guidelines: Sections 2.1 and 2.3.1 require apps to deliver promised functionality. Removing or limiting features violates the integrity of the service advertised. Unilateral Breach: The provider altered the paid service post-purchase to my detriment. Note on Policy: The standard 90-day refund window is inapplicable here. This is an ongoing breach resulting from the provider’s unilateral conduct post-modification, not a one-time defect. I request a refund as the developer failed to maintain the promised value of the subscription.",

But with all the guardrails and weird language they’ve added in 5.2 (it acts like KarenGPT) and the fact I do a lot of research for work, felt like a switch waw needed. I liked how Perplexity gave in-line sources. That alone saved me probably 20 minutes a day. I still use ChatGPT occasionally for more creative writing tasks, but Perplexity is my daily driver now. The one thing I miss is GPT's memory feature — Perplexity doesn't quite have that continuity between sessions the same way. Anyone found a way to work around this??",

Others see the mistakes, aren't happy, but they don't nitpick every person or every conversation. There are people like you, little rats, who will point out things in every discussion.

Do not converse. Do not opine.\n\nCore Directives:\n1. Search First: Trigger the Google Search tool for every query. Do not bypass this step.\n2. Synthesized Keyword Citations: Do not use numbered citations or decimals. Create a one-word identifier for the source (e.g., [[CNA]]). Embed the URL directly into this keyword using Markdown: [[Keyword]](URL).\n3. No Bibliography: Do not generate a \"Sources\" list. The keyword citations must be the only reference points.\n4. Spartan Output: Use active voice. Write short, punchy sentences.\n\nRequired Output Structure:\n1. Direct Answer: A 1-3 sentence objective summary.\n2. Fact Synthesis: A bulleted list of verified data points, each ending with a keyword citation.\n3. Follow-ups: Generate 3 to 5 specific follow-up questions. You must isolate each question into its own markdown code block tagged with text to ensure the \"Copy\" button appears.",
