      "text": "Been thinking about how cashback actually works from a product POV.  \nWith normal cards it’s dead simple: Spend > fixed rebate > done. Predictable, boring, no choices.  \nWhen rewards are paid in an asset instead, the dynamic changes a bit. You can sell immediately and treat it like normal cashback, or hold and take some volatility for potential upside. Same spend, different risk profile.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that each transaction creates a tiny, user-controlled exposure funded by spend that was happening anyway. That seems to change how people perceive rewards vs points or cash equivalents. I tracked this casually for a bit and the realized value ended up drifting from the headline rate just based on timing decisions. Obviously cuts both ways, and volatility/taxes/liquidity all matter.\n\nCurious if folks here see asset-based rewards as a legit engagement lever?",

My previous places had 40 people MAX and you'd just figure things out as you went  \n  \nOnboarding was 2 weeks with actual training instead of someone showing me where slack is and good luck. There's an org chart that makes sense and product roadmap instead of whatever the founders decided that week  \n  \nEngineering has processes now too. PR reviews aren't just whoever's around like there's sprint planning and we don't push to prod on Fridays(sounds basic but coming from seed stage chaos it feels almost corporate)  \n  \nHiring takes multiple rounds and forever compared to the week long process I'm used to but people fit their roles instead of everyone doing everything  \n  \nI didn't expect the jump to feel this big with way more meetings and process but things move faster because nobody's constantly figuring out what we're even doing  \nI am very happy with my current state here and I would love to hear if you guys who have transitioned similarly to me/from seed to series B feel the same  \nShare your experiences",

      "text": "I wanted to ask something in general and understand if this is actually a thing or not.   \nIn many fintech or payment apps, the KYC process at the start looks very simple and quick. You do OTP, PAN or Aadhaar, and you can start using the app. Everything seems fine initially. But I’ve heard people say that later on, sometimes after months of usage, accounts can suddenly go under review, transaction limits get reduced, or apps ask for re-verification again. In those cases, users don’t always get a clear reason or timeline and support responses are usually very generic**.** \n\nI’m trying to understand if this actually happens commonly or if it’s just rare cases. Is this mostly because of regulatory requirements, or is it more about how fintech apps manage and communicate KYC internally?\n\nIf anyone here works in fintech, payments, banking, or has seen this from a product or operations side, would like to hear your perspective. Also curious if regular users have noticed this pattern or not.\n\nJust trying to understand whether this is a real systemic issue or not.",

          "text": "This is completely normal and happens for legitimate reasons, though the poor communication is a real problem.\n\nWhy it happens. Regulators require ongoing monitoring, not just onboarding verification. In India specifically, RBI mandates periodic KYC refresh for financial services, typically every two years for low-risk customers and more frequently for higher-risk profiles. So even if your initial verification was perfect, you'll get asked again eventually.\n\nThe sudden review triggers are usually one of a few things. Transaction patterns that look unusual compared to your stated profile, like someone who said they earn 5 lakh annually suddenly moving 50 lakh. Regulatory updates that require additional documentation from existing users. Risk model updates that reclassify certain user segments. Or sometimes just hitting a transaction volume threshold that moves you from simplified KYC to full KYC requirements.\n\nThe communication problem is real and it's a product failure more than a regulatory one. Most fintechs treat compliance as a backend function that interrupts the user when needed rather than designing proactive communication into the experience. Our clients building fintech products have found that users tolerate re-verification much better when they're warned in advance and given clear timelines rather than waking up to a frozen account.\n\nThe generic support responses happen because frontline support often genuinely doesn't know why compliance flagged a specific account. The risk and compliance teams don't share detailed reasoning for security reasons, so support can only say \"under review\" because that's all they know.\n\nIt's systemic in the sense that every regulated fintech does this. The variance is in how well they communicate and how fast they resolve it.",

          "text": "The credit ledger gap is real and it's one of the more frustrating parts of building card products. Most issuer processors are transaction processors pretending to be credit platforms.\n\nThe core problem is that processors like Marqeta and Lithic are excellent at authorization, clearing, and settlement but they're not accounting systems. They'll tell you a transaction happened, but receivables management, interest calculation, statement generation, and the full credit lifecycle are either bolted on or left to you entirely. You end up needing a ledger that understands credit as a concept, not just debits and credits.\n\nWhat teams actually do in practice. Most early-stage companies build a thin ledger layer themselves and regret it within 18 months. The initial build seems manageable until you're handling partial payments, disputes that span statement cycles, interest recalculations after backdated adjustments, and regulators asking for transaction-level audit trails. The edge cases multiply fast.\n\nCanopy is probably the most purpose-built option for credit ledger functionality. They handle servicing, interest, statements, and the accounting complexity specifically for lending products. Worth evaluating if credit is core to your product rather than just a feature.\n\nLithic has been building more credit-specific functionality but it's still maturing compared to their debit infrastructure.\n\nSome teams use loan management systems like Peach or LoanPro and connect them to their card processor, treating the card as an origination and transaction channel while the LMS handles the credit accounting. Clunky but it works if the integration is clean.\n\nOur clients building credit products have found that the build versus buy decision hinges on how central credit complexity is to your differentiation. If you're competing on rewards or user experience, buy the ledger infrastructure. If your edge is in credit decisioning or unique repayment structures, you might need more control.\n\nThe stitching approach works but budget for more integration engineering than you expect.",

In the last 6 weeks, I've learned of 2 additional Indian remittance companies quite by accident, and I'm in the FinTech space. \n\nA maybe better way to look at this is what are the growing or/and underserved markets, and how many companies operate in that space. Is there place for a new company? What's your USP and Will CAC be a problem?",

Many fintechs do lighter KYC upfront and then tighten checks later based on things like transaction volume, account age, risk model changes, or regulatory updates. When that happens, accounts can suddenly go under review or get restricted. Support usually can’t explain much because they genuinely don’t know the details or legally can’t share them.   \nSo the vague 'please wait' responses aren’t always incompetence, they’re kind of built into how compliance and risk teams operate.  \nGiven that reality, I’m curious about the \"**product side of this problem\"**. If fintechs can’t disclose investigation details, what actually works to reduce user frustration? Is it advance warnings, clearer timelines, better status visibility, or something else?\n\nFor people who’ve worked in fintech, payments, or compliance-heavy products; what have you seen work in practice, and what seems working in theory but fails in real regulated environments?",

An employee reviews the documents and compares the business description with the website from which API requests will originate. \n\nIf they don’t match — rejection. If they do, automated checks run against AML lists and the company is verified in the commercial registry (tax number, business activity, address, etc.).\n\nIf everything is fine, screenshots of the homepage and store are taken and stored with the submitted documents. The merchant is approved for basic KYC and the API becomes active.\n\nA script visits the website once per month, takes screenshots, and stores them with the documents. If the hash differs by 20%, it raises an alert; if it differs by 50%, the account is blocked and administrators are immediately notified by email for review.\n\nIf the merchant reaches a predefined monthly sales threshold, the API stops accepting requests. Several dashboard notifications appear before this limit is reached. At that point, additional documents are required to allow the API to continue operating — now without limits 😉. This is integrated into a real payment gateway and works very well.\n\nThere’s no need to monitor every transaction manually… you can also add red flags for unusually large transactions or many small ones.\nGood luck!",

Telling users \"you're approaching a threshold where we'll need additional verification\" while they can still act is massively better than freezing the account and then asking for documents. Our clients who implemented soft warnings saw support ticket volume drop significantly compared to hard stops with no notice.\n\nExplicit expectations during onboarding. Most users don't know that additional verification is even possible later. A single screen during signup explaining \"as your usage grows, we may need additional documentation\" sets expectations and reduces the feeling of betrayal when it happens.\n\nStatus visibility without details. You can show \"document received, under review, estimated 2-3 business days\" without disclosing why the review was triggered. Users mostly want to know something is happening and when it might end, not necessarily why.\n\nGuaranteed human escalation paths. Even if the frontline agent can't share details, knowing there's a way to reach someone with authority reduces frustration. The feeling of shouting into a void is worse than the actual wait.\n\nWhat sounds good but fails in practice. Chatbots and automated status updates that just repeat the same information. Vague timelines like \"up to 30 days\" when most cases resolve in 48 hours. Promising callbacks that never happen.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that some fintechs deliberately keep communication vague because friction during review causes some risky users to self-select out.

I left that company and joined Fiserv and that was one of the worst decision of my life. Before joining itself the Manager stated reaching out to me on whatsapp and one day he shouted at me just 2 days before my joining and it was because I asked so many questions about the health insurance and pension plan. The manager called me and blasted that who gets pension and health insurance from the first day. It was so rude. It gave me a feeling that I have taken a wrong step already. Later he apologised and convinced me to join the company.\n\nThey all work from Nenagh and they all are like doing micro management. They started monitoring in/out timings and attendance. They made it mandatory to be in the office campus for atleast 8.5 hrs every day and if they find it lesser they will set up a meeting and ask for the reason in the email. I have seen the tensed faces in Fiserv where people are really stressed to go out even in the lunch time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/be7zjrfcg1jg1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3872b75c1e563e39c9de9c9b4dc836a6dccae085\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hv0g9yhcg1jg1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=734bdac65986db8e62e21df070cd7113f081b1a5\n\nThey ask everyone to come to office but they dont have proper canteen even and whatever they have is just for the cakes and pastries and that too very expensive.\n\nMy life was made hell by my manager. He comes from the same place where I am from but instead of supporting me he started torturing me. He wanted me to be sacred, frightened, tensed but I was not that kind of person and he didn’t like this. He used to blast at me for every small thing. For any ask like wfh or leaves he used to behave as I have something very big from him and he is doing a big favour by approving my leaves or wfh.\n\nI had my citizenship ceremony in Killarney around 5pm in the evening for which I had to travel from Dublin. When I reached out to him for the leave he became so angry. He wanted me to return the same day from Killarney and come to office the next day which was nearly impossible as I had to travel with my 3 years old kid. But he wasn’t ready to hear anything. He even advised me to miss the citizenship ceremony and attend some other time. My manager himself took half a day leave for his citizenship ceremony but in my case he wanted me to return the same day from Killarney. He first threatened me about bad rating if I take leave. When I wasn’t scared then he threatened me about losing of my job even. I joined on 1st Oct and 15dec he gave me a bad rating and I was on PIP.\n\nAnd finally 1 week before my probation complete date I was called and fired. That day also the manager shouted at me. He told me that because of me the company is in loss. I told him Cmon I am a family man and I have my own responsibilities and I left my previous giant Fintech company for Fiserv and this is I have to see today. My father is a cancer patient and because of my manager’s ego and immaturity I had to suffer and it was a very stressful condition for me.\n\nFiserv is the worst company I have ever worked. They fire every year and they have hire and fire policies and the management is completely non-supportive. I have seen them torturing the people to travel to Nenagh.",

          "text": "Airwallex is the faster path to live for EU/UK but the operational concerns you've heard are valid. They work well at lower volumes and simpler use cases. Once you scale or hit compliance edge cases, funds getting stuck in review becomes a real pattern. Their support responsiveness degrades noticeably when you're not a top-tier account. The API is decent but webhook reliability has been inconsistent for some use cases, which matters a lot if you're running your own ledger and need clean event streams.\n\nLorum is more purpose-built for the platform model you're describing. Designed around holding balances, multi-currency, and the kind of ledger-first architecture where you need external events to reconcile cleanly. Less name recognition but the teams using them for similar setups tend to report fewer operational surprises once integrated. The GCC corridor coverage is worth verifying directly since that's a thinner market for most providers.\n\nThe reconciliation pain point you mentioned is where the real difference shows up over time. Airwallex statements can require manual cleanup when transactions reverse or settle weirdly. If your internal ledger depends on trusting external events without constant hand-fixing, that friction compounds. Our clients running platform payments have found that the \"boring\" operational qualities, like stable transaction IDs and predictable webhook sequencing, matter more than feature lists once volume ramps.\n\nFor GCC specifically, neither is a slam dunk. Airwallex has some coverage but AED and BHD corridors are often handled through partners rather than direct rails, which adds latency and reconciliation complexity. Worth asking both for specifics on how those corridors actually work rather than trusting the website coverage maps.\n\nThe practical move is running a pilot with real edge cases, reversals, partial settlements, multi-currency conversions, before committing. The happy path always works. It's the exceptions that reveal whether you'll be debugging their system or running your business.",

AI Risk Radar (The \"Red Flag\" Engine):** Instead of just sentiment analysis, this engine looks for anomalies like inventory spikes vs. revenue growth, or subtle shifts in management’s vocabulary compared to the last 4 quarters. It generates a \"Risk Score\" and explains the \"Why\" in plain English.\n\n**2. Real-time Earnings Call Insights:** A live-streaming transcript service that doesn't just transcribe, but \"tags\" management answers. If an executive becomes evasive or uses language historically linked to negative future performance, the UI flags it in real-time.\n\n**3. Visual Volatility Calendar:** A dashboard to map out upcoming earnings for a specific watchlist, focusing on expected volatility rather than just the date.\n\n**The Question for** r/FinTech\\*\\*:\\*\\*\n\n* **As professionals/enthusiasts:** Do you think a \"Risk Score\" is too reductive for investors, or is the \"Key Red Flags\" list more valuable?\n* **Regarding the Live Insights:** Would you find real-time flagging distracting, or is it the \"killer feature\" for someone who can't listen to every word?\n\nI've attached some UI mockups below to show the current direction. Any feedback on the UX or the underlying logic would be hugely appreciated\n\n**What's New: I've built an AI tool to spot red flags in financial reports!**\n\nI've been working on an AI that digs into financial reports to help you spot potential risks. Try the web version now and let me know what you think!\n\n**Give it a try:** [**https://www.next4.ai/stockAI/m-audit.html**](https://www.next4.ai/stockAI/m-audit.html)\n\nIf you find it useful, an app version is coming next! Check out the real analysis it generated for Snowflake (SNOW) below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ki70sbbokig1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=6101392d737e5bc598813199a88644126c3fff4b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1f7bwbbokig1.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=1807f9aeea1e637b96f85035902a2773be753265\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xbccegbokig1.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=011fd18d12fc2d48e0ca32569fd97d62ed31f6f8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pblibqbbokig1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe7c77128874345ec432c786578722d037d6457c\n\n",

      "text": "I want to share this because I think a lot of teams are sitting on the same problem and don't know it yet.\n\nDuring audit prep last month we pulled a random sample of 200 corporate client files to review our beneficial ownership documentation. Expected maybe 5-10% would have minor gaps. The actual number with material errors in their UBO mapping was 30%. Not missing documents. Wrong ownership structures. Chains that stopped one entity too early. Nominees recorded as actual beneficiaries. Circular ownership loops that nobody caught during onboarding.\n\nThe initial reaction from the team was pure panic. 30% of 200 is 60 files. But we have roughly 3,000 corporate clients. If the error rate holds across the full book, we're looking at 900 client files with potentially incorrect UBO data. That's not a remediation project. That's a crisis.\n\nThe first question from senior leadership was whether we needed to pause onboarding while we fixed it. Which I understand but practically that means telling the business to stop generating revenue while compliance cleans up a mess that accumulated over years. That conversation went about as well as you'd expect.\n\nWhat we're doing instead is running parallel tracks. New onboarding continues but with a completely revised UBO verification process that addresses every failure pattern we found in the sample. Existing client remediation happens in batches prioritized by risk. Highest risk client types first. PEP-connected entities. Multi-jurisdictional structures. Clients in high-risk geographies.\n\nSo far most of our errors came from the same root causes. Analysts relying on client-provided org charts without independent verification. Registry data that was outdated at the time of onboarding and ownership thresholds applied inconsistently because different analysts interpreted the 25% beneficial ownership rule differently for complex structures.\n\nThat last one was hard because it's a training and process failure not a data failure. We had the information in many cases we just applied the rules wrong.\n\nFor anyone who hasn't stress tested their UBO data recently I'd strongly recommend pulling a sample before your regulator does it for you. The error rate might surprise you. Start with your most complex client structures because that's where the problems hide. Multi-layered holding companies, trust structures, anything involving nominees.\n\nWe're about eight weeks into the remediation now. It's going to take at least another four months to work through the full book. Not fun but at least we found it ourselves.",

          "text": "The parallel track approach is the right call. Shutting down onboarding to remediate is the kind of decision that sounds responsible in a compliance meeting and gets you fired in a board meeting.\n\nThe 30% error rate is high but not shocking for corporate KYC that accumulated over years with inconsistent processes. The dirty secret of most AML programs is that the data quality degrades over time while everyone assumes it's fine because onboarding \"completed successfully.\" Our clients who've done similar audits typically find error rates between 15-40% depending on client complexity and how many process changes happened without retroactive cleanup.\n\nThe root causes you identified are universal. Client-provided org charts are lies until verified, not because clients are malicious but because they often don't know their own ownership structure accurately. The 25% threshold interpretation issue is brutal because it's genuinely ambiguous in complex structures. Does a 20% holder who also controls the board count? Depends on who you ask and when you ask them.\n\nOne thing that helps with the remediation prioritization beyond risk factors is looking at transaction volume and relationship profitability. A dormant high-risk client matters less than an active one pushing volume through daily. Regulators care about what's actually flowing through the bad data, not just the theoretical risk.\n\nThe timeline reality is that four more months is optimistic if you're doing proper verification rather than just asking clients to re-confirm what they already told you. Re-verification that actually catches circular ownership and nominee structures requires independent registry pulls and sometimes investigative work. Budget for at least some percentage of clients who can't or won't provide adequate documentation, and have a plan for whether you exit those relationships or accept enhanced monitoring.\n\nThe training failure piece is worth investing in properly. Written procedures that address the specific ambiguities you found, with worked examples of the exact structures that tripped people up, prevent this from recurring.",

          "text": "Good catch finding this yourselves before regulators did. Four more months of remediation is painful but better than the alternative.  \n\nThe 30% error rate doesn’t surprise me. Most onboarding tools treat UBO mapping like filling out a form instead of solving a logic puzzle. Since I’m not sure what your onboarding flow looks like, I’m going to assume it’s a form. Maybe consider visual ownership graphs with validation that blocks progress? When you’re looking at nested tables or form fields, circular loops and incomplete chains hide. Same data as a node graph? Those problems are instantly obvious. Add hard stops when the chain doesn’t resolve to a natural person.\n\nOn the monitoring side, consider ongoing registry checks and drift detection. Corporate structures change constantly but compliance systems treat them like static snapshots. Periodic re-validation (time-based or triggered by external signals like acquisition news) catches when your UBO data has gone stale. Otherwise you’re documenting historical ownership and calling it current.\n\nWe work on compliance flows for fintech companies and see these patterns a lot. Happy to share more specific examples if useful. DMs open.",

Repeat.  \nIt worked well but it was built for a world of banks, borders, and intermediaries.\n\nWallet to wallet payments are quietly changing that model.\n\nWhen two wallets transact, there is no acquirer, no card network, no interchange stack in the middle. Value moves directly from one user to another, often in seconds, sometimes in real time. No chargebacks. No weekend delays. No hidden routing logic.\n\nWhat makes this shift important is not crypto speculation. It is usability.\n\nPeople are already using wallets to pay freelancers, settle global invoices, send family money across borders, and move stablecoins like digital cash. For them, it feels closer to sending a message than making a payment.\n\nCard networks still dominate retail, but they were not designed for programmable money, micro payments, or always on global settlement. Wallets are.\n\nThis does not mean cards disappear. It means the monopoly on payments is ending.\n\nThe future of payments is not plastic.  \nIt is software.\n\nAnd increasingly, it lives inside wallets.",
