I’m not an AI expert — I was pulled into an internal AI project because of my domain and testing background.\n\nThe goal was to use AI to generate business rules for mortgages and consumer loans. On paper it sounds great — faster rule writing, less manual effort, more efficiency.\n\nIn practice… it’s been messy.\n\nWe tested multiple baseline models. Refined prompts. Added structured output constraints. Wrapped guardrails around it. Tried narrowing scope. And still:\n\n\t•\tLogical inconsistencies\n\n\t•\tEdge cases breaking\n\n\t•\tConfident-but-wrong outputs\n\n\t•\tStrange eligibility conditions\n\n\t•\tFormatting issues that could affect downstream systems\n\nFrom a QA perspective, this isn’t minor. In lending, small logic errors can mean incorrect approvals or declines. That’s compliance exposure, audit findings, and real customer impact.\n\nWhat’s honestly making me uneasy is that there’s still momentum to move it closer to production. I get the innovation pressure. AI is the buzzword. Nobody wants to look like they’re lagging behind.\n\nBut there’s a difference between using AI as a drafting assistant that a human fully owns and validates… and letting it influence decision logic in heavily regulated systems.\n\nAgain, I’m not anti-AI. I actually find the tech interesting and I’m not trying to block innovation. I just feel like the reliability and determinism gap is being underestimated.\n\nAm I overreacting?\n\nIs anyone else in fintech seeing this “ship it and harden it later” mindset around LLMs?\n\nHow are you drawing the line between assistive tooling and production decision logic?\n\nTrying to figure out if this is just internal pressure where I am or if this is where the industry is heading.",

          "text": "You're not overthinking this. Your instincts are correct and the concerns you're raising are exactly what a good QA person should be surfacing.\n\nThe core problem is that LLMs are probabilistic systems being asked to produce deterministic logic. Business rules in lending need to be exactly right every time. An LLM producing a rule that's correct 95% of the time is a compliance nightmare because you don't know which 5% is wrong until it's already made bad decisions. The \"confident but wrong\" pattern you're observing isn't a bug you can fix with better prompts, it's fundamental to how these models work.\n\nThe distinction you drew is the right one. AI as drafting assistant where humans fully validate every output is reasonable. AI influencing production decision logic in regulated lending is a different risk category entirely. The problem with the second scenario isn't that AI is involved, it's that the validation burden doesn't actually decrease. If you have to fully verify every rule the AI generates, you haven't saved effort, you've added a step while creating false confidence that the AI output is a reasonable starting point.\n\nThe \"ship it and harden it later\" mindset around LLMs is absolutely happening across fintech. Our clients see it constantly. The pressure comes from leadership reading headlines about AI transformation and not wanting to fall behind. The problem is that \"harden it later\" doesn't work for compliance. You can't un-approve a loan that shouldn't have been approved, and regulators don't accept \"we were iterating\" as an explanation for fair lending violations.\n\nWhere to draw the line practically. If the AI output goes directly into a system that affects customer outcomes without expert human review of every single output, it's not ready. If the failure mode is \"customer gets wrong decision\" rather than \"employee has to redo some work,\" the bar for reliability is regulatory, not just operational.\n\nDocument your findings thoroughly. When this becomes an audit issue later, you want a clear record that QA raised concerns.",

I spent years watching financial services companies pour millions into voice automation while their users were literally bleeding out through broken application flows. The obsession with voice AI feels like we're polishing the doorknob while the house is on fire - sure, it's shiny and impressive, but people are still walking away frustrated before they even need to make a call.\n\n\n\nI've been neck deep in this exact problem, especially working with alternative lenders who were losing deals left and right because their KYC and application processes were these nightmarish document upload marathons. Users would get halfway through uploading bank statements or tax returns, hit some validation error or unclear instruction, and just... leave. No phone call, no complaint, just gone. We built intelligent agents at Starter Stack AI that actually understand what users are trying to accomplish in real time and can guide them through these complex flows, fix data issues on the spot, and eliminate those friction points that cause abandonment. The difference in completion rates is honestly staggering.\n\n\n\nThe revenue math on this is pretty brutal when you actually run the numbers. A 10-15% reduction in drop-offs during loan applications or onboarding can literally translate to millions in additional originations for mid-sized lenders, way more impact than automating another hundred collection calls. But voice AI gets all the buzz because it's easier to demo and sounds more futuristic than \"we made the form filling experience not suck.\" The real opportunity is building apps that can actually think and problem-solve alongside users instead of just displaying static information and hoping for the best.",

I’m a Senior AE (70k base / 150k OTE) and consistently hit quota.\n\nFor the past 6+ months, I’ve also been:\n\n* Hiring and interviewing new AEs\n* Training and coaching\n* Letting an underperformer go\n* Building sales processes\n* Representing sales in product meetings\n* Supporting enterprise deals\n* All while still carrying my own number\n\nWe have two AEs total (including me). I hired the other rep, and he’s still ramping and requires support.\n\nI asked the President about formalizing a Director of Sales role and adjusting comp. He said he’s “not sure we need a manager” yet, but expects me to build the sales team.\n\nAt this point, it feels like I’m being asked to do leadership work without authority or compensation — basically doing it for free.\n\nIs this a normal “prove it first” situation in small companies? Or is this a misalignment I should push harder on?\n\nTrying to handle this strategically, not emotionally. Appreciate any honest thoughts.",

Usually a Director should carry a base of $125-$150k depending on the company size. So if you approach it as a middle ground that rewards you for your extra care and attention, but still saves him on a new hire at a higher comp plan then he should see the logic and give you the bump up. \n\nIf you go a bit deeper and do some market research to see what the Director level roles are like in your region and industry then share that info while you’re asking for more money, that shows you’re aware of your value in the marketplace and it also shows the value of your smaller ask of 15-20k. \n\nAlso, ask yourself if you want to grow into a director role fully? If yes, then the conversation is about setting you on a path and the comp is the motivator for that. If that’s the case, then in that same conversation position the bump as a stepping stone to when you become a director and will grow the sales team and take on the target of your whole team. But that would also be another raise and restructuring of your comp plan to give you a variable that’s brings your OTE close to $200k.\n\nI caution you against actually interviewing/accepting another role and telling him about it. I used to work for a VP who would counter offer the role, then fire the person after 6 months because they weren’t loyal enough.",

There’s typically some meaningful equity (of course only really matters when the company successfully exits) to align incentives.\n\n^^ This is what your actual role sounds like - could be wrong. You can use this if you look for a role elsewhere and it should resonate.\n\nWhich do you care about more - authority or compensation?\n\nYou could open up a conversation about comp - equity, higher commission with higher targets, etc. It doesn’t need to be dependent on becoming a director or manager.\n\nYou could also ask for more details on when they see the need coming. If you’re involved in hiring, you will probably have a decent idea. 3-5 direct reports is a reasonable point to need it.\n\nYou could ask for more explicit authority but I wouldn’t do that without having the pay behind it. They are incentivized to do this. It’s a business, and the objective is to get the most ROI out of their capital as possible - you are human capital.\n",

          "text": "Yeah, this GenAI visibility gap is a real pain point, especially in regulated industries like fintech where data lineage and access are critical. It sounds like you're already on the right track thinking about order.\n\nFrom my experience, the first practical step that really makes a difference is actually starting with a thorough audit of what's \\*already happening\\* – the 'shadow AI' problem. Engineers are often using tools and connectors you might not even know about. So, I'd focus on:\n\nWe landed on using AccuKnox for this.   Use logs from your cloud providers, existing SIEM, and network traffic analysis to understand which AI tools and services are being used and what data they're interacting with. This is where you start building that initial map of app/data paths. It's not glamorous, but you can't secure what you don't know exists.\n\nOnce you have a rough idea of data flow, implementing strong data classification and discovery in your vector stores and wherever prompts are being processed becomes key. Tools that can identify sensitive data types (PII, financial info) are crucial here. We saw our sensitive data leakage risk drop by about 85% after getting a better handle on this.\n\nAfter inventory and classification, you can start layering in controls. This usually means starting with broader access policies for connectors and then getting more granular with prompt content filtering and data egress controls. Trying to do everything at once is a recipe for burnout.\n\nThe engineers will adopt new tools, and your job is to discover that adoption and then put appropriate guardrails in place systematically. It's an iterative process. A tool that helps unify visibility across cloud workloads, APIs, and data, especially with agentless capabilities, can really streamline this discovery phase without adding more operational overhead.",

Clean up over-permissioned roles and long-lived tokens. Turn on logging around connectors and data movement. Then layer in prompt/egress controls.\n\nIf you skip straight to prompt filtering without fixing access, you’re just putting a filter on top of overshared data.\n\nDSPM-style tools (Sentra, Cyera, etc.) are relevant in that they help answer “who can access what and can it reach a model.”",

          "text": "The visibility gap problem is real and the order of operations matters more than most teams realize.\n\nInventory first, always. You can't secure what you don't know exists. Before tightening anything, map what GenAI tools are actually in use, not what's officially sanctioned. Shadow AI adoption is rampant. Check DNS logs, SSO integrations, expense reports for AI subscriptions, browser extension audits. Our clients consistently discover 3-5x more AI tools in use than IT officially approved. This inventory becomes your scope.\n\nData flow mapping second. For each tool identified, trace what data sources it can access. Copilots connected to email, docs, or code repos have implicit access to everything in those systems. Vector stores and RAG pipelines often ingest more than intended because someone pointed them at a broad file share. The connector and plugin architecture of most GenAI tools creates transitive access that's easy to miss.\n\nPermission tightening third, and this is where the real work starts. Most GenAI data exposure isn't the AI doing something wrong, it's the AI having access to data the user shouldn't have seen in the first place. Pre-existing permission sprawl becomes visible when an AI assistant surfaces documents the user technically had access to but never would have found. Fixing this is unglamorous IAM hygiene.\n\nLogging and monitoring fourth. Once you know what exists and have tightened permissions, instrument what you can. Prompt logging is sensitive because it captures user input, so legal and HR need to weigh in. But knowing what data is being sent to which models is essential for incident response.\n\nDSPM or AI security layers are useful but they're an overlay on the foundations above. They help with ongoing visibility and policy enforcement but can't fix gaps in inventory or permissions they don't know about.",

You would have to provide “credit” in order for you to report payments to credit reference agencies.\n\nWithout serious funding behind you, it will be impossible to get the support you need to make this work.",

You are 100% right.\n\nI fully admit my mistake🤷‍♂️  \nI didn't do enough deep research on the compliance side before I started building. My motivation blinded me a bit 🙃. I genuinely believed this would be a massive, legal, and highly convenient solution for people. Seeing that Stripe provided almost everything out of the box (Payment Gateway + seamless KYC via Connect Express) made me rush into development, assuming they would naturally support the escrow-like flow for this use case.\n\nThat being said, I have absolutely zero regrets. Catching this critical flaw *before* launching and touching real user money is a huge win for me.\n\nThis roadblock definitely isn't going to stop me. Right now, I am waiting on replies from a few BaaS providers to see if I can partner with them and legally operate under their regulatory umbrella for the safeguarding piece. If I find the right provider, I have absolutely no problem rewriting the backend and adjusting the code to integrate their system, as long as it guarantees user funds are safe and makes the platform a true success.\n\nAs for the credit score feature, you're entirely right about the regulatory headache. Since I'm doing all that alone, I will push that to future updates once the core safeguarding is fully secured with the right provider.\n\nThanks again for the insights, it saved me from a massive disaster!",

In fact, the US was a massive part of the roadmap from day one.\n\nMy original plan was to launch in the UK first to establish a really strong PoC and validate the model, and then immediately flip the switch to open it up in the US right after.\n\nThat’s actually the main reason I fell into the Stripe trap in the first place. I built the entire backend around Stripe Connect because I thought it would give me a seamless, out-of-the-box way to scale across both the UK and the US simultaneously without having to rebuild the infrastructure. It was a huge letdown when I realised their TOS strictly prohibits holding funds in escrow for this type of flow in both regions.\n\nBut launching in the US is still an absolute top priority for me once I secure the right BaaS/safeguarding partner",

But here’s the uncomfortable question: What if infrastructure velocity is masking monetization fragility?\n\nInfrastructure CapEx is front-loaded and visible. Revenue durability is back-loaded and uncertain. If deployment velocity materially exceeds monetization maturity, the correction doesn’t show up immediately. It shows up when pipeline conversion slows, CAC stretches, or revenue quality degrades.\n\nWe’ve seen versions of this before, capacity built ahead of sustainable demand. So I’ll put it plainly: Are we measuring real revenue resilience or capitalizing belief into today’s multiples? \n\nFor those in infra, fintech, B2B, or capital allocation:\n\n* Are your pipelines showing durable monetization depth?\n* Or are you underwriting future operating leverage that hasn’t yet materialized?\n\nCycles punish misalignment between capital intensity and revenue realization.\n\nCurious how others are stress-testing this over the next 12–36 months?

Cross-border means connecting systems that weren't designed to talk to each other, operated by institutions in different regulatory regimes with different risk tolerances.\n\nCorrespondent banking adds latency by design. When your bank doesn't have a direct relationship with the destination bank, the payment hops through intermediaries. Each one does its own compliance checks, batches according to its own schedule, and takes its own cut. A payment might touch 3-4 banks in different time zones with different cut-off times.\n\nThe compliance layer is where transparency dies. AML and sanctions screening happens at each hop, but institutions don't share results. The same payment gets screened multiple times, and if it's held for review somewhere in the chain, downstream parties just see unexplained delay.\n\nFX settlement adds another timing dependency. Real-time gross settlement for FX requires pre-funded nostro accounts in both currencies, tying up capital. Most institutions batch FX to manage exposure.\n\nThe newer rails trying to solve this either create closed networks where participants agree to shared rules and pre-funding, or use stablecoins to separate value transfer from traditional banking rails. Both work but require enough participants to be useful, which is the adoption challenge.",

              "text": "That is a really clear breakdown, especially the point about compliance layers destroying transparency at each hop. The batching of FX and pre-funded nostro accounts also explains why real-time cross border remains difficult in practice, even if the front end looks instant.\n\nIt seems that newer rails, including players like Crebit using alternative settlement approaches, are trying to reduce some intermediary friction, but as you said, network effects and shared rule sets are probably the real adoption barrier rather than pure technical capability.",

The false positives thing especially, you end up babysitting the bots more than they actually save you time. For reconciliations specifically, the real issue is usually that your source data is living in too many disconnected places (ERP, bank feeds, spreadsheets, vendor portals) and the RPA is just moving bad data around faster.\n\nSo when something breaks you can't even tell which system is the source of truth. I'd honestly step back and think about whether the problem is automation or whether it's that your data isn't unified in teh first place. If you're pulling from a bunch of different systems and manually prepping data before it even hits your automation layer, something like Scaylor might help.\n\nIt's designed to sync data from ERPs, spreadsheets and other tools into one central warehouse automatically, so you're working from clean standardized data instead of duct-taping sources together with scripts. Makes the whole reporting process way less fragile when quarter-end rolls around. For lighter automation needs a lot of finance teams just use Zapier or Make for simple tasks and keep the complex logic in their actual systems instead of trying to automate everything.\n\nSometimes boring and manual is better than clever and broken.",
