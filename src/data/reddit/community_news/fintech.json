      "text": "currently evaluating different solutions out there to speed up onboarding and reduce manual KYC workload, and i keep running into the same issue: a lot of products look great until you ask what happens when inputs are messy and compliance needs a defensible trail.\n\nthe biggest blocker for us at the moment are chasing missing docs, checking completeness, pulling supporting evidence, packaging the case, and making sure the decision is explainable later. i mean if automation only moves the work from analysts to QA it’s not really a win. right now i’m seeing teams split the stack into layers. case management lives in old tools, and then there’s an agent layer that's supposed to handle first-pass prep and evidence gathering. i've seen a lot of tools lately saying could automate KYC/KYC... not assuming any of them work, just want to run a pilot that proves whether they can actually follow SOP intent and produce audit-grade artifacts.\n\nif you’ve experimented with tools in this category please do share with me your thoughts. i don't need name drops, i already have few vendors in mind, i need practical feedback. appreciate all",

You can certainly do pilots, or at least get demos, with those providers to see how far they'll take you. We always ended up needing our own internal audit trail and KYC proprietary processes that sat alongside those vendors to track the overall KYC state and additional data (including documents), which we built on [Luther](https://www.reddit.com/r/luthersystems/). I could be wrong, but most likely there isn't an all-in-one solution that does everything your business needs.",

          "text": "The \"moves work from analysts to QA\" trap is exactly the right concern. Most automation in this space just shifts the bottleneck rather than eliminating it.\n\nWhat actually works versus what vendors claim based on what our clients have piloted.\n\nThe document chasing and completeness checking part automates reasonably well. Rules-based workflows that detect missing docs, send templated requests, and track response status are mature enough to trust. This is the lowest-risk automation because the failure mode is just asking for something you already have, not making a compliance decision.\n\nEvidence gathering and case packaging is where things get interesting. The newer agent-based tools can pull registry data, cross-reference sanctions lists, and assemble supporting docs into a coherent case file. When it works, it saves hours per case. When it doesn't, it confidently assembles garbage that looks complete but isn't. The key differentiator is whether the tool surfaces confidence levels and provenance for each piece of evidence. If it just hands you a finished package without showing its work, you're back to reviewing everything manually anyway.\n\nThe explainability requirement is where most tools fail compliance scrutiny. Regulators want to understand why a decision was made, not just what decision was made. If your automation layer is a black box that outputs \"approve\" or \"refer to analyst,\" you haven't reduced compliance burden, you've added a system you now need to justify. The tools that work in regulated environments generate step-by-step reasoning tied to specific policy criteria, essentially showing their homework.\n\nWhat to actually test in a pilot. Give it your messiest 10% of cases, the ones with inconsistent names, partial docs, or edge-case entity structures. If it handles those gracefully with clear escalation logic, it'll handle the easy 90%. If it chokes or produces garbage, you know the ceiling.",

They suggested Seamless Chex and GoCardless, but I’m skeptical those actually fit my use case.\n\nMy constraints / requirements:\n\n* US-only\n* ACH only (no cards)\n* Peer-to-peer between individuals (not businesses)\n* Low / zero volume to start\n* Clean audit trail (legal-sensitive use case)\n* I’m trying to *avoid* heavy “merchant-style” onboarding UX for normal users\n\nStripe Connect is the obvious answer, but Connect still frames recipients as merchants, which feels like a UX mismatch for my audience. That said, I know identity verification is unavoidable.\n\nWhat I’m trying to understand from people who’ve actually shipped this:\n\n* Is there a realistic alternative to Stripe Connect at very low volume, or is this just the cost of doing business?\n* Has anyone successfully used Moov, Seamless Chex, GoCardless for irregular, two-way consumer payments?\n* Are there sponsor-bank / program-manager options that even talk to founders this early, or is that a later-stage move only?\n\nNot looking for shortcuts or gray-area hacks, just trying to choose the *least wrong* option so I don’t have to rip out payments in 6 months.\n\nAppreciate any real-world experience here.",

If you get this going I’d love to hear more about it but moving money P2P is a legal/compliance struggle more than a technical one.\n\nFor reference we move money bank to bank (between ourselves and clients) with ACH using Plaid. It’s not cheap and it’s not a quick process. When we signed up they wanted to be sure we were not doing P2P money movement. While they support it, it’s an early product that they are very carefully selecting clients for. So if you go that route be ready to cough up a lot of authoritative documentation explaining what you’re doing, how you’re doing it, how you’re monitoring it, your audit process, audits you’ve had done, your legal counsel’s opinion (probably not required but they’d like to have it), diagrams and more.\n\nI recall some comment from someone at some point saying Moov was good. Given your scenario though you’re probably going to get a lot of due diligence from them too.\n\nDefinitely look into every state’s money transmitter laws where you’re operating. An MTL would probably help land a service provider or partner if that fits your scenario.\n\nYou can try local banks if you’re small but they’d be taking a risk on you committing fraud, money laundering, etc. WebBank and Cross River Bank are common fintech partners though I can’t speak to what they’ll require from you.",

          "text": "The honest answer is Stripe Connect is probably your least painful option at this stage even with the UX mismatch. The alternatives either won't talk to you at your volume or have worse tradeoffs.\n\nMoov is worth a conversation. They're more developer-friendly than legacy ACH processors and their identity verification flow is cleaner than full merchant onboarding. They're also more willing to work with early-stage companies than Dwolla. The catch is you're still dealing with the same underlying regulatory requirements, so \"lighter onboarding\" has limits when you're moving money between consumers.\n\nGoCardless is primarily designed for recurring payments and payee collection, not two-way P2P. The UX assumes a business is pulling from customers, not peers settling obligations. Probably not a fit unless you contort your flows significantly.\n\nSeamless Chex is more of a verification and risk tool than a payment processor. You'd still need actual rails.\n\nThe regulatory reality you need to internalize is that P2P consumer payments in the US trigger money transmission concerns. The reason Dwolla bounced you isn't just volume, it's that their compliance setup for consumer-to-consumer flows is heavier than B2B. Stripe Connect's \"merchant\" framing exists partly because treating recipients as merchants rather than random consumers simplifies their regulatory position.\n\nSponsor bank and BaaS relationships at your stage are tough. Unit, Treasury Prime, and similar players generally want to see product-market fit and some volume trajectory before engaging. You're looking at months of integration work even if they said yes today.\n\nOur clients in similar positions usually start with Stripe, accept the imperfect UX, and plan to migrate once volume justifies better options. Ripping out payments later is painful but less painful than spending six months trying to find the perfect early-stage solution that doesn't exist.",

Our clients building ML features typically budget more time for data pipeline work than actual model development, which feels backwards but reflects reality.\n\nThe explainability requirement kills a lot of approaches that would otherwise work. You can build a fraud model with great AUC but if you can't explain why it flagged a specific transaction, you can't deploy it. This pushes you toward simpler models or hybrid systems where ML does the scoring but rules handle the edge cases. Less elegant, more shippable.\n\nCompliance review adds cycles that don't exist in other industries. Model risk management wants to understand your training data, validation approach, monitoring plan, and fallback procedures. Depending on the use case this can add months to a launch timeline. Not because anyone's being obstructionist, but because the regulations actually require this diligence.\n\nWhat actually moves faster is starting with automation that assists humans rather than replaces decisions. Document extraction, anomaly flagging for human review, case prioritization. These are lower risk because a human still makes the final call. You build trust with compliance and operations teams, then gradually expand the automation boundary as you prove reliability.\n\nThe teams that ship quickly in fintech usually aren't moving fast on novel ML, they're moving fast on well-understood patterns with strong monitoring and easy rollback.",

The real challenge isn't the crypto part anymore - it's architecting reliable fiat rails that scale without turning into a full banking operation.​\n\nFintech bridges like Keytom follow a proven blueprint under MiCA rules: Fireblocks for custody, Clear Junction for IBAN/SEPA Instant, Crassula core for tracking swaps with audit trails, Sumsub for upfront KYC/AML so payouts stay clean. This modular stack lets them handle stablecoin inflows without full banking licenses, focusing on high-volume freelancer flows while dodging PSD3 scrutiny on payments.​\n\nKey trade-offs that matter in 2026:\n\n* **Speed vs scrutiny**: Instant SEPA delivers, but MiCA's AML layers can add reviews on $150k+ monthly volumes, balancing UX with DORA resilience rules.​\n* **Limits vs flexibility**: Generous caps support teams, but attract more EBA oversight vs rigid exchange withdrawals.​\n* **Fiat vs crypto depth**: Strong IBAN/SEPA edges out cards for B2B payouts, though multi-chain swaps lag behind pure DEXes.​\n* **Costs**: $10/month premiums crush per-tx fees for regulars, especially with white-label APIs emerging for custom stacks.​\n\nWith MiCA Phase 2 live and digital euro pilots ramping, which stack pieces win for crypto-EUR bridges?",

The problem is MiCA compliance isn't just about having the right vendor logos in your architecture diagram. The operational reality is messier, especially once you're actually processing volume.\n\nThe $150k monthly threshold you mentioned is where things get interesting. Below that you're mostly in \"light touch\" territory. Above it, the source of funds scrutiny gets real. Freelancers with legitimate crypto income from multiple clients across different chains create complex audit trails that automated systems flag constantly. Our clients building similar flows spend more time on false positive resolution than actual fraud, which kills the UX advantage you're trying to create.\n\nThe IBAN/SEPA instant strength for B2B payouts is real. Cards are a nightmare for crypto-adjacent flows because Visa and Mastercard still treat crypto businesses as high-risk MCCs regardless of how clean your compliance stack is. Direct bank rails avoid that entirely but you're dependent on your banking partner not getting cold feet when they see transaction patterns they don't understand.\n\nWhat I'd push back on is the framing that this is \"solved\" by picking the right vendors. Clear Junction and similar EMI partners have pulled out of crypto clients before when their own banking relationships got pressure. You can have perfect MiCA compliance and still lose your fiat rails because your partner's correspondent bank got nervous. Redundancy in banking partners matters more than optimizing any single stack component.\n\nThe digital euro pilot stuff is mostly irrelevant for near-term business decisions. That's years away from affecting actual payment flows.",

How was the developer experience?\n* Specifically, how do you handle the 2-day ACH settlement gap? Do you let users spend \"pending\" funds, or is that a recipe for disaster?\n* Are there any \"hidden\" pitfalls with Column’s KYC (Entity) onboarding flow that I should know about now?\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who has navigated these APIs before.

      "text": "When we started building our order-to-cash platform, we were fully aware that giants like Chargebee and others were already dominating the space. The first year, with just a small founding engineering team, was all about listening and learning. We sat with over 100 people, discussing the real pain points at ground level, focusing on what would make a real impact.\n\nI’m also noticing a trend: There was a time, 7–10 years ago, when companies would only prefer legacy SaaS tools for rev-rec or accounting. But now, the situation has completely shifted. Big tech giants are demanding repetitive innovation in the product, as they face new and evolving challenges with accountants and customers.\n\nAfter developing some basic tech, we started approaching startups in India, targeting those with around $10M ARR. We began with small-ticket orders, keeping our expectations grounded, and slowly but surely, we started seeing traction. Fast forward to now, we’re hitting some really good numbers in contracted revenue.\n\nI know it’s early days, and we still have a long way to go, but moments like this feel worth celebrating. Not to pat ourselves on the back, but to remind the team of what’s possible when you push through the tough early stages. I firmly believe that celebrating these wins, no matter how small, helps maintain momentum and motivation. We’re now working towards achieving the big numbers, and I’m confident we will get there too.\n\nAnyone else in the early stages? How do you keep the team motivated and celebrate these small victories on the road to scaling?",

      "text": "In fintech, consent is often treated as something that automatically follows the data. Once a user signs up, teams assume that consent quietly moves with the information wherever it goes, across systems, partners, and vendors.\n\nOn the surface, that assumption feels reasonable. It only becomes a problem when someone asks you to prove it.\n\nFintech data is rarely static. It moves continuously between banks, payment processors, KYC providers, analytics platforms, cloud infrastructure, and internal systems, often without any single team seeing the full picture.\n\nEach transfer introduces another layer of complexity and another opportunity for a gap to form.\n\nMost teams rely on the belief that onboarding consent covers all of this movement. In practice, that belief tends to collapse the moment a regulator, auditor, or even a cautious partner asks a very simple question:\n\n“Show us the consent.”\n\nThat is usually where discomfort begins. The issue is rarely that consent was never taken. The issue is that no one can clearly explain what that consent looks like today.\n\nWho captured it? What exactly did the user agree to at that moment? Was the consent limited to a specific purpose, or was it broad enough to cover future uses? Did it explicitly allow sharing with third parties? And can that record still be retrieved years later, when memories and systems have changed?\n\nWhen those questions don’t have clear answers, silence becomes expensive very quickly.\n\n**### Consent Is Evidence, Not a Concept**\n\nIn fintech, consent is not a philosophical idea or a UX pattern. It is evidence. It is a record that must withstand audits, regulatory scrutiny, disputes, and the passage of time.\n\nIf your setup relies on implied consent, assumed consent, or vague references to “industry standards,” you are carrying far more risk than it may appear. Regulators are not interested in what felt reasonable at the time. They are interested in what can be demonstrated now.\n\nMost consent failures are not rooted in bad technology. They stem from unclear ownership.\n\nWhen multiple companies touch the same data, responsibility often slips into a grey zone. Product teams assume legal has handled it. Legal assumes the product flow captures it correctly. Vendors assume the fintech already obtained it.\n\nWhen no one clearly owns consent, everyone ends up exposed. This is why explicit consent cannot be informal or implicit. It needs structure, clarity, and accountability built into the system itself.\n\nFor fintech teams, that starts with defining who is responsible for collecting consent at each stage of the data flow. It also means clearly stating what that consent covers, not only in privacy policies but in partner and vendor agreements as well.\n\nConsent logs need to be stored, time-stamped, and retrievable long after onboarding is complete. Internal systems must align so that consent is not just captured once, but respected everywhere the data travels.\n\nIf data is shared across entities, contracts should state clearly who is responsible for responding when proof of consent is requested.\n\nNot eventually. Not in theory. Immediately. Because in fintech, “we assumed it was covered” is not an acceptable answer.\n\n**### Final Thoughts**\n\nIn fintech, consent is not a feeling or a checkbox. It is evidence. When consent is assumed, loosely defined, or poorly documented, it turns into a serious risk during audits and disputes.\n\nClear ownership, structured consent flows, and retrievable records are not optional. Consent that cannot be produced on demand might as well not exist.\n\nIn an industry where data moves fast and scrutiny is constant, the only consent that truly matters is the one you can show, clearly and confidently, when asked.[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1qhtul2)",

      "text": "I’m a recent CS grad currently looking for **Applied AI Engineering roles**, mainly in **finance / fintech**.  \nHonestly, I’m tired of just applying online, so I started building things instead and wanted some real feedback.\n\nOne of my recent projects is a **RAG system built around the SEC EDGAR API**, where users can chat with company filings like **10-Ks, 8-Ks, and other disclosures** and get accurate, source-grounded answers. The idea was to make it easier to understand what’s actually going on inside top public companies without digging through massive documents.\n\nI don’t have deep financial industry experience — I’m coming at this more from the **AI + systems side**. That said, after talking to a few employees at traditional banks here in SF, I’ve realized many of them are *still using very old systems*. It feels like there’s a huge opportunity to apply AI properly in these environments, even if they don’t actively care yet.\n\nI also built another project around **fraud detection**, where multiple agents work together to detect and prevent suspicious payment transactions. It uses **x402-style protocols** to share signals, and about **5 agents collaborate** to analyze risk before allowing a transaction to go through.\n\nAt this point, I’m just trying to figure out:\n\n* Am I even thinking in the right direction?\n* Do these kinds of projects actually map to real-world finance problems?\n* What would you improve or change if you were building this inside a bank or fintech company?\n\nIf anyone here works in **finance, banking, or fintech**, and is willing to give a bit of honest feedback or perspective, I’d really appreciate it. Even a few comments would help a lot.\n\nThanks for reading.",

          "text": "You're thinking in roughly the right direction but there's a gap between demo projects and what actually gets deployed in finance that's worth understanding now.\n\nThe SEC EDGAR RAG system is a solid portfolio piece but the honest truth is this space is crowded. There are already products doing exactly this, some quite well. The technical challenge isn't the RAG pipeline, it's the domain nuance. Financial analysts don't just want answers, they want answers that understand accounting context. When a 10-K mentions \"goodwill impairment\" or \"material weakness in internal controls\" the system needs to recognize significance, not just retrieve text. Our clients evaluating these tools care more about precision on domain-specific queries than general retrieval quality.\n\nWhat would make it more interesting is if you built something that connects information across filings. Show me every time this company changed their revenue recognition language over five years. Flag when risk factors suddenly expand. That kind of longitudinal analysis is where humans waste hours and automation actually helps.\n\nThe multi-agent fraud system is a trickier one to evaluate. Multi-agent architectures sound impressive but in production fraud systems the hard part isn't the agent coordination, it's the features, the latency requirements, and the feedback loops. Real fraud detection runs in milliseconds with models trained on labeled data that took years to accumulate. Showing five agents \"collaborating\" is cool for a demo but a bank's fraud team will ask about false positive rates, p99 latency, and how you'd retrain when fraud patterns shift.\n\nThe old systems observation is correct but the reason they persist isn't that banks don't know better. It's that replacing core systems is terrifying when a bug means losing money or regulatory heat. AI adoption in finance is slower than it should be because the cost of being wrong is high.\n\nFor roles, the EDGAR project probably resonates more with fintech startups and asset managers than banks. The fraud project needs real performance metrics to be credible.",

So that security is a standard part of the dev workflow, not a bolt-on.  \n  \nExternal partners fill the gaps. Lean on outside experts for the highly specialized stuff that a lean startup team shouldn't hire for full-time yet. The trick is picking a partner that is as agile as a fintech. You want someone who speaks your stack and moves at your velocity.  \n  \nAnd this is where I'm biased...the incident response mindset. There’s a direct parallel between scaling a startup and IR. Our teams are used to being dropped into the fire. We arrive in chaos, fight our way out, and leave with a more resilient org.

For GDPR, you'll need a way of tagging data so you can quickly look up (and delete) all data belonging to a specific user—so keep this in mind before blasting it across a ton of random databases and services.",

Migrating EMI or payment providers mid-growth is painful as hell, lots of customer re-verification, new IBANs, potential service gaps. Better to pick something that scales even if it costs slightly more upfront.\n\nFor EMI, the UK/EU split post-Brexit means you likely need relationships in both jurisdictions anyway. Modulr works well for UK, decent APIs, reliable, good for MVP scale. For EU, Banking Circle or Railsr (formerly Railsbank) cover most of Europe. ClearBank does both UK and is expanding into EU. If you want single provider simplicity with global ambitions, look at Airwallex or Currencycloud (now part of Visa), they're built for cross-border from the start and handle multi-region expansion better than UK-first providers.\n\nDirect debit is fragmented by design since every region has its own scheme. GoCardless is the obvious choice here, they cover UK (Bacs), EU (SEPA), and have been expanding into US (ACH), Australia, and others. Their API is clean and the coverage means you won't need to switch as you expand. Stripe also does direct debit across regions if you're already in their ecosystem.\n\nOpen banking PIS is where it gets messy. TrueLayer and Yapily both cover UK and EU with solid APIs. Plaid has EU coverage now but their PIS is weaker than their AIS. For MVP I'd lean TrueLayer since they've been doing PIS longer and have better bank coverage. Global expansion for open banking is tricky because the regulatory frameworks differ so much, Australia, Brazil, and others have their own standards. No single provider covers everything well yet.\n\nOur clients typically start with regional specialists for MVP speed, then add providers rather than switch as they expand. The abstraction layer approach, building your own internal payments interface that can route to multiple providers, saves pain later even if it's overengineering for day one.",

So you can start lean now, but when you want to expand to the US or Asia later, you just spin up local accounts on the same platform without needing to migrate or redo your compliance.",

          "text": "The drop-off pattern is pretty consistent across most banks and fintechs we've seen data from.\n\nDocument capture is the biggest killer. The moment you ask someone to photograph their ID, you lose a huge chunk of applicants. Some don't have their ID handy, some can't get a clean photo, some get spooked about uploading documents. Completion rates typically drop 20-30% at this step alone. The liveness check selfie compounds it since people fail on lighting, angles, or just feel weird about it and abandon.\n\nAddress verification is sneaky painful. Sounds simple but people enter addresses inconsistently, the validation rejects legitimate formats, or they're at a new address that doesn't match their ID. The back-and-forth of \"please re-enter your address\" or \"address doesn't match our records\" creates rage quits.\n\nSSN/SIN entry is a trust cliff. A meaningful percentage of users won't enter their social insurance or security number into an app, period. Doesn't matter how many security badges you show. They either abandon or go find a branch.\n\nEmployment and income screens have high error rates rather than pure abandonment. People don't know their employer's exact legal name, they guess at income, they're not sure how to categorize gig work. This creates downstream verification failures that look like fraud flags but are actually just confused applicants.\n\nThe citizenship and tax residency questions trip up more people than you'd expect. Dual citizens, recent immigrants, people who've lived abroad. The forms assume simple cases and anyone with complexity either guesses wrong or gives up.\n\nOur clients who've actually moved the needle focused on reducing screens before the hard stuff. Get email and phone upfront, show progress, and let people save and return. The ones who front-load document capture lose more total applicants than those who build some investment first.",
