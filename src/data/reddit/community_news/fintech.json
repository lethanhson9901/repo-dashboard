          "text": "You're looking for card-on-file updater services. The options depend on whether you're an issuer or working through a processor.\n\nVisa Account Updater (VAU) and Mastercard Automatic Billing Updater (ABU) are the network-level services that handle this. As a card issuer or program manager, you push updated card details to the networks and participating merchants automatically receive the new credentials. Coverage is decent but not universal since merchants have to participate, and not all do.\n\nThe catch is you don't integrate with these directly in most cases. Your issuer processor or BIN sponsor handles the network connectivity. So the real question is whether your current processor supports VAU/ABU and how well their implementation works. Some processors handle it seamlessly, others have it technically available but the enrollment and data flow is clunky.\n\nIf you're on Marqeta, Lithic, or similar modern issuer platforms, they generally have account updater built in or easily enabled. The implementation is mostly configuration rather than heavy engineering. Older processors may require more manual work to get it running properly.\n\nThe coverage gap is real though. Not every merchant participates in the network updater programs. Subscription services and large retailers generally do because failed recurring charges cost them money. Smaller merchants often don't bother. So you'll reduce failed transactions significantly but won't eliminate them entirely.\n\nOur clients running card programs typically see 60-70% of card-on-file relationships updated automatically through the network services. The remaining 30-40% still result in declines that the cardholder has to fix manually.\n\nOne thing to discuss with your processor is the timing. Some implementations push updates in batch which can take days, others are near real-time. For lost/stolen replacements the speed matters since you want merchants updated before the next billing cycle hits.",

There is a few different flavors of this (batch, Real Time, Network Tokens). However, in this case, it sounds like you are issuing a card to your consumers, and want to update at the merchants where your consumers have their cards stored. This isn't really possible, as that is more on the merchant to do with their payment processor (and there a few reasons for this, mostly merchants dont want to update cards if they do not plan on billing your consumer in the foreseeable future) Your role would be to provide updated information to the processors when they go to do an update.\n\nThe best tool for this is network tokens, as the networks (Visa, MC) would be doing the update, but again that is enabled by the processor.\n\nI should be clear, my experience is more on the acceptance side, rather than issuing, so maybe someone can correct me, but I havent heard of issuers pushing out wide reaching updates to merchants.

          "text": "The \"buy a platform versus best-of-breed\" question is the right starting point because the answer determines how much of your life you want to spend on integration work.\n\nThe platform approach wins for most mid-size teams. Running separate tools for DLP, CASB, access control, and detection sounds great until you're maintaining five different policy engines that don't talk to each other and your analysts are swiveling between four dashboards. The integration tax is real and it compounds every time you add a new SaaS app or cloud service.\n\nWhat actually works in practice. For cloud and SaaS visibility, Microsoft Purview is solid if you're already a Microsoft shop. It covers DLP, classification, and access monitoring across M365 and Azure natively. The cross-platform coverage is weaker but if 70% of your data lives in Microsoft's ecosystem it's the path of least resistance. If you're multi-cloud or Google-heavy, Netskope or Palo Alto's DSPM do a decent job of discovery and classification across environments.\n\nThe tools that sound amazing but become tuning nightmares are almost always DLP solutions. Every vendor demos beautifully with clean data and predefined policies. In production you're drowning in false positives within a week because real data doesn't look like demo data. Our clients who've had success with DLP started extremely narrow, one data type, one channel, tuned until false positive rate was manageable, then expanded. The teams who turned everything on day one abandoned the tool within six months.\n\nFor access control, the boring answer is usually right. Proper IAM hygiene, regular access reviews, and least-privilege enforcement through your identity provider catches more risk than any fancy tool. Veza or ConductorOne can help automate access reviews if manual reviews are falling behind.\n\nDetection and response is where best-of-breed sometimes wins. Your SIEM or XDR platform handles the detection layer but data-specific alerts often need a specialized tool feeding signals into it rather than trying to make the SIEM understand data context natively.\n\nThe one thing I'd prioritize above any tool purchase is knowing where your sensitive data actually lives. You can't protect what you can't see. Start with discovery and classification before buying protection tools.",

Your MVP launched with basic KYC. Now every new feature needs updated policies, legal review, maybe a new license. Each expansion costs more in compliance overhead than engineering.\n\nWhat actually moved the needle for our clients who got past the stall. Partnerships with established players was the most common unlock, solving trust and distribution simultaneously. Narrowing focus rather than expanding, owning one use case for one segment completely rather than being mediocre across five. And unit economics clarity early so you know whether to raise, pivot pricing, or change channels.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is most fintech MVPs stall because the market they targeted isn't big enough to sustain the compliance and distribution costs required to serve it.

PDF internal structure analysis, looking for editing artifacts left by tools like Adobe or online PDF editors. Font consistency across the document since spliced text often uses slightly different font rendering. Metadata inspection for creation dates, software used, modification timestamps that don't match the supposed document origin. Image analysis for utility bills and bank statements checking for compression artifacts around edited regions. Cross-referencing extracted data against known templates for major issuers like specific banks and utility companies.\n\nOnfido, Jumio, and Veriff all offer document verification beyond basic OCR. Shufti Pro is cheaper and decent for lower volume. The pricing jump from basic OCR to forensic verification is meaningful but way less than building in-house, and you get ongoing model updates as fraud techniques evolve.\n\nOur clients in regulated fintech usually land on a tiered approach. Automated checks handle the bulk of verifications, anything the system flags as suspicious gets routed to manual review, and you set thresholds based on risk level. Higher value accounts or higher risk jurisdictions get stricter automated checks before human review.\n\nThe compliance question to answer concretely is what's your false acceptance rate tolerance. That number drives how aggressive your verification needs to be and helps you evaluate vendors objectively rather than arguing about vague \"authenticity\" requirements.",

Compliance checks were done “when someone had time.” Reporting was a mess of spreadsheets no one fully trusted.\n\nAt first, the team tried to fix it by hiring more people. That only made things slower and more fragile. What actually broke them wasn’t competition or capital, it was the operational drag. Manual processes quietly piled up until the business couldn’t move fast enough anymore.  \nSince then, I’ve noticed a pattern: fintech startups that survive don’t just build good products, they automate the boring, critical workflows early.\n\nCurious if others here have seen a startup stumble because of manual ops.

          "text": "For a small business with distributed sales team, Ramp is probably your best bet. The cashback is 1.5% flat with no categories to optimize around, the expense management is genuinely good, and the controls for distributed teams work well. You can issue virtual cards instantly for specific vendors or spending categories and set per-card limits. The receipt matching and auto-categorization saves real time compared to chasing salespeople for expense reports.\n\nBrex has pulled back from small businesses and is focusing more on mid-market and enterprise. Unless you're venture-backed or have significant cash balances they may not even approve you. Worth checking but don't count on it.\n\nOther options worth considering. Amex Business Gold or Platinum gives you points instead of cashback which can be worth more if you travel, plus the brand carries weight with some vendors and clients. The expense tooling is weaker than Ramp though so you'd potentially need a separate expense management layer.\n\nMercury offers corporate cards tied to their banking product. If you're already banking with them or considering it, having cards and banking in one place simplifies things. The rewards are modest compared to Ramp but the unified dashboard is nice.\n\nFor a distributed sales team specifically, the things that matter most in practice are easy virtual card issuance so you're not mailing physical cards everywhere, clear spending policies that enforce themselves, and receipt capture that doesn't require nagging. Ramp handles all three well.\n\nOur clients running similar setups usually land on Ramp for the operational efficiency and only choose Amex when the travel rewards or brand perception matters more than expense automation.\n\nOne thing to check is whether your current accounting software integrates cleanly with whatever you pick. A card program that doesn't sync with your books just moves the manual work from expense reports to reconciliation.",

Does the expense tracking actually reduce the back-and-forth, or does it just create a fancier spreadsheet?  \n3.

They're particularly strong on the multi-entity/distributed team side - the approval workflows are actually intuitive (rare in fintech), and their virtual card provisioning is instant. The GL coding automation is legitimately helpful if you're trying to close books faster.  \nThe cashback rates are pretty competitive across the board these days - I'd focus more on which platform actually reduces your team's administrative load vs. just digitizing the same painful process.  \nWhat's your current pain point - the reimbursement process, the lack of spend visibility, or something else?",

Scanning places where people are already talking about the problem (like Reddit or niche forums) is usually a much stronger signal early on than broad targeting.\n\nOnce intent is clear, the bottleneck I’ve seen is turning those conversations into usable B2B leads without a ton of manual work. That’s where pairing intent discovery with lightweight enrichment helps. We’ve used Peak AI at that stage to fill in work emails or validate contacts after identifying relevant companies, which keeps things focused instead of scaling spend blindly.\n\nCurious what segments you’re seeing the most traction from so far.",

Until you can consistently get someone to say “yes” on a call, ads just help you waste money faster.\n\n\n\nI’d start with:\n\n\\- Direct outreach: LinkedIn DMs, warm intros, industry WhatsApp/Telegram groups.\n\n\\- Answering niche questions: here on Reddit, local forums, founder/SMB communities.\n\n\n\nChannels later: Google Search for high-intent “B2B payments \\[your country\\]”, maybe Reddit/Meta retargeting, and I’d only touch LinkedIn once ACV is high and positioning is tight.\n\n\n\nFor tiny budgets, think in experiments: $300–$500 per channel to buy learning, not growth. I’ve used HubSpot and Apollo for outbound, and Pulse to surface Reddit threads where people are literally complaining about payments so I can jump in with something specific. So the point: nail one narrow use case via hand-to-hand selling before you pump money into ads.",

Instead of spreading thin across platforms right away, lean into channels where you can hyper-target decision-makers; LinkedIn is a natural fit but can get pricey, and Meta can surprise you if you target by job title or industry interests.\n\nWith limited funds, aim for learning over scaling. Test creatives and messaging with small daily budgets, then double down on what’s moving the needle. That’s exactly where something like Didoo AI shines - it automates testing and optimization so you’re not stuck manually fiddling with audiences and creatives all day, which is a huge time and budget saver early on.\n\nNothing beats founder-to-founder: be patient, track unit economics closely, and treat your ad spend as a research budget until your funnel’s solid. Ads are worth it, just not before you’ve nailed what you’re actually selling and who’s actually buying.",

CFA is brutal time commitment and primarily useful if you want traditional asset management or equity research roles. It won't help you stand out in virtual economies or gaming/fintech intersection. CAIA is alternatives-focused which is slightly more relevant but still oriented toward institutional investment careers. Neither will give you credibility in the space you're describing.\n\nThe \"thought leader in virtual economies\" goal is interesting but vague enough to be paralyzing. What specific problem are you actually trying to solve? In-game economies and inflation? Real money trading marketplaces? Tokenized gaming assets? Each of these is a different market with different players and different paths in. Narrowing down would help you figure out what skills and credentials actually matter.\n\nFor VC or product roles in gaming/fintech intersection, what matters is demonstrated understanding of the space and ability to ship things. A portfolio of written analysis on virtual economy problems, a prototype of something in the space, or actual work experience at a relevant company will get you further than any certification. Our clients hiring for product roles in niche areas like this care about domain expertise and execution track record, not letters after your name.\n\nThe practical path is finish your degree, build something small in the virtual economy space even if it's just analysis or a prototype, and target internships or entry roles at companies actually working on these problems. Gaming companies with live service economies, crypto gaming projects, fintech companies touching gaming payments. Real experience compounds faster than credentials in emerging spaces where nobody knows what the \"right\" background looks like anyway.",

No allegations. No explanation at the time.\n\nI was then required to:\n\n\t•\tSubmit invoices\n\n\t•\tSubmit bank statements\n\n\t•\tExplain business model\n\n\t•\tAttend an interview (civil, not under caution)\n\nAfter reviewing the documents, the police officer herself applied to court to set aside the POCA order.\n\nThe court agreed.\n\n⸻\n\nThe problem\n\nThis wasn’t fraud.\n\nThis wasn’t money laundering.\n\nThis wasn’t criminal.\n\nIt was a commercial dispute, and Airwallex treated it like organised crime.\n\nWhat’s terrifying is:\n\n\t•\tPOCA is designed for serious criminal proceeds\n\n\t•\tAirwallex appears willing to trigger it over routine business disputes\n\n\t•\tThe freeze applied to all funds, not the disputed amount\n\n\t•\tThere is no meaningful warning, timeline, or recourse while it happens\n\nEven worse:\n\nThe police cleared it faster than Airwallex froze it.\n\nThat tells you where the real dysfunction sits.\n\n⸻\n\nWhy this matters\n\nIf you’re a:\n\n\t•\tfounder\n\n\t•\tinternational trader\n\n\t•\thigh-volume business\n\n\t•\tbusiness relying on USD/EUR rails\n\nYou need to understand this risk.\n\nWhen fintech banks say “we may freeze your account for compliance”, what they really mean is:\n\nWe can remove your access to working capital instantly, escalate it to law enforcement, and let you fight to prove innocence.\n\nEven if you’ve done nothing wrong.\n\n⸻\n\nMy takeaway\n\n\t•\tAirwallex is extremely risk-averse to the point of recklessness\n\n\t•\tPOCA should be a last resort — not a compliance shortcut\n\n\t•\tThe damage to a business during a freeze is real, immediate, and severe\n\n\t•\tBeing “cleared” doesn’t undo the disruption\n\nI’m not naming myself or my company, but I would not choose Airwallex again, and I strongly suggest anyone considering them understands this risk before trusting them with material balances.\n\nIf you’re choosing a banking partner:\n\nAsk yourself what happens on their worst day — not their best.",

This playbook will enable you to go through your companies internal process and publish status updates (even to your customer)\n\nI know there are quite some tools out there that currently do those, so what do you think there are missing that would be a game changer for you if they had it ?

A lot of platforms feel clunky when you try to plug them into existing stacks. APIs are limited, webhooks are rigid, and customization usually means hacking around their system. If you want a game changer, make it dead simple to integrate with whatever workflow a company already has.\n\nAnother missing piece is real‑time monitoring and adaptive risk scoring. Most tools just run static checks, but imagine if the system could continuously update a customer’s risk profile based on new data sources or behavioral signals. That would move KYC from a one‑time compliance box‑check to an ongoing intelligence layer.\n\nAnd honestly, UX matters too. Compliance software is notorious for bad dashboards. If you can make reporting and playbooks intuitive, with clear audit trails and human‑readable outputs, you’ll win over both engineers and compliance officers.\n\nSo yeah, the basics are covered by existing players. The differentiator is seamless integration, adaptive intelligence, and a clean user experience.",

          "text": "Testing compliance flows in production is a terrible idea for obvious reasons. You don't want real customer data mixed with test scenarios and you definitely don't want to submit fake KYB documents to actual compliance providers.\n\nMost KYC/KYB providers have sandbox environments but they're limited. Sumsub, Onfido, Jumio, and similar all offer test modes with predefined personas that trigger different outcomes like pass, fail, manual review, document expired. The problem is these sandboxes don't cover the weird edge cases that actually matter, like a business registered in one jurisdiction with directors in three others and a complex ownership structure.\n\nWhat actually works for comprehensive testing. Build a mock compliance layer that sits between your orchestration system and the real providers. Define your own test personas that map to real scenarios your customer cares about. Sole proprietor, multi-entity corporate, high-risk jurisdiction, PEP involvement, mismatched beneficial ownership docs. Route test transactions through the mock layer and real ones through the actual provider. This gives you unlimited test scenarios without touching production compliance infrastructure.\n\nFor the stablecoin payment flow specifically, most chains have testnets where you can simulate the actual payment mechanics. Ethereum Sepolia, Solana devnet, whatever chain you're on. Circle has USDC on testnets. The payment orchestration logic can be tested end to end without real money.\n\nThe gap our clients usually hit is the integration between payment confirmation and compliance status. Payment lands on-chain but KYB is pending, or KYB passes but the wallet isn't whitelisted yet. These state machine edge cases are where bugs hide and they're best caught with a proper test harness, not production testing.\n\nBuild a scenario matrix with your customer. Every combination of KYB status, KYC status, payment amount threshold, jurisdiction, and entity type. That becomes your test plan and also your documentation for compliance auditors who will eventually ask how you validated the system.",

          "text": "Corporate cards are genuinely better than the alternatives they replaced. The question is whether \"better than expense reports and reimbursements\" is a high enough bar, and it isn't.\n\nThe modern card platforms like Ramp, Brex, and similar have actually moved the needle on the control side. Real-time spend visibility, per-card limits, merchant category restrictions, automated receipt matching. Compared to handing someone a shared Amex and hoping they submit receipts, it's a massive improvement. That part works.\n\nWhere it falls apart is exactly what you described. The approval workflows are clunky, ownership gets murky as teams scale, and finance still ends up doing after-the-fact cleanup rather than proactive management. The tools promise \"set policies and forget\" but in practice every company has edge cases that don't fit clean rules. Someone needs a higher limit for one vendor, a contractor needs temporary access, a subscription renewal hits an expired card. Each exception becomes a manual touch.\n\nThe deeper problem is that cards are a spending mechanism being asked to be a spend management system. Those are different things. Our clients managing distributed teams have found that the card itself is maybe 30% of the problem. The other 70% is budget ownership, procurement process, and forecasting. No card platform solves those well because they're organizational problems not payment problems.\n\nThe \"finance as traffic controller\" observation is accurate and it's a design failure in how most companies implement these tools. If every transaction needs someone in finance to approve, adjust, or reconcile, you've just digitized the bottleneck rather than eliminating it.\n\nWhat actually reduces operational load is pushing budget ownership to department leads with hard limits and letting finance focus on exceptions and trends rather than individual transactions.",

How they’ve helped in my experience, when done right:\n1. No reimbursements later. Spend gets captured and reconciled in the same cycle instead of chasing people three months later with “hey can you upload that receipt?”\n2. Employees save a ton of time and don’t have to front their own money, which quietly removes a lot of friction and resentment.\n3. Big win for finance if the controls are good. The card should know where it’s being used, block obviously wrong stuff, and auto-tag spend to the right category or GL without manual cleanup.\n4. When cards have dumb limits and generic rules, finance becomes a traffic cop. When they have contextual controls, finance actually gets to lead instead of react.\n\nSo yeah, corporate cards can be great. But only if they’re opinionated enough to enforce policy on swipe, not just record mistakes after the fact.",

The moment you're talking to any company with 50+ employees or a regulated entity, their infosec team needs something real.\n\nStart with SOC 2 Type I.

At its core it is a report in which a trusted third -party validates that the risk controls in your environment related to one or more trust criteria are what you say they are. \n\nNot a perfect comparison but think in terms of a home appraisal. That appraisal report is a trusted party reporting on the value of a property. Now can you and should you have the home relatively built before the appraiser comes out? Yes! This gives you the most cost effective experience. \n\nSimilarly if you begin checking off the controls before you engage a third-party auditor, compliance automation tool, consultant, you can have a better control on out of pocket costs. The implementation of many of the controls in your environment is definitely \"bootstrappable.\"  I recommended searching the web for SOC 2 control list just to make yourself familiar with the controls and determine what you can do on your own. \n\nI run TPRM for several companies including fintechs. SOC 2 isn't a silver bullet; although it does expedite the security portion of the due diligence review. If Ops really likes what you are offering, we will do a long form security review (we ask for a bunch of policies / procedures),screenshots of configurations, etc. + a commitment to complete SOC 2 usually within 6 months.\n\n  \nThe key takeaway is SOC 2 is a report that reflects what risk controls you have built into your environment. So the most important thing to do is build the controls.",

What matters early is showing a clear roadmap (Type I → Type II), solid baseline controls, and transparency in security reviews. \n\nRule of thumb: build **as if SOC 2 is inevitable,** retrofitting later is painful.

I’d stay in FinTech sales till you’re old. Keep learning what’s out there, hone in your investment knowledge on your own portfolios. You can wholesale or get into wholesaling later in life. Fintech you will eventually be phased out by younger, smarter, and cheaper. \n\nHere’s the truth: AI isn’t coming for relationships/fintech sales. It’s coming for busywork.\n\nIn moments of uncertainty around money or health, people don’t need more AI generated, fluffy data. They need steadiness, judgment, and real presence. That human core can’t be automated.\n\nAI will run the workflows.

I recently came across a platform called ZeroID that lets users create virtual cards funded directly with crypto, which made me think about where this fits into the broader financial ecosystem.\n\nOn one hand, removing dependence on banks and enabling near-instant access to spending feels aligned with the direction fintech has been heading, especially for globally mobile users and people underserved by traditional banking. On the other hand, questions around compliance, reliability, card issuer relationships, and long-term sustainability immediately come to mind.\n\nFrom a fintech perspective, do you see products like this as a meaningful evolution in payments infrastructure, or more of a niche solution for crypto-native users? I’m also curious how you evaluate risk with platforms that position themselves as privacy-focused while still operating within card networks.\n\nWould love to hear thoughts from people who track payment innovation closely or have experience building in this space.",

          "text": "Crypto cards are real products that work today, but they're solving a narrower problem than the marketing suggests.\n\nThe actual use case that works is letting crypto holders spend without manually off-ramping. You have USDC or ETH, you want to buy coffee, the card handles conversion at point of sale. Coinbase Card, [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com), Gnosis Pay all do this reliably. The value prop is convenience for people who already hold crypto, not replacing traditional banking for mainstream users.\n\nThe \"underbanked\" narrative is mostly marketing. People who are genuinely underserved by traditional banking usually have issues that crypto cards don't solve, like income verification, credit history, or geographic restrictions. A card that requires you to already have crypto assets isn't reaching the unbanked, it's serving crypto holders who want optionality.\n\nThe privacy-focused angle is where I'd be skeptical. Card networks are inherently surveillance infrastructure. Visa and Mastercard see every transaction. A platform can promise privacy on their end but the moment you're using card rails, transaction data flows through traditional financial infrastructure. The tension between \"privacy-focused\" and \"operates within card networks\" is real and usually resolves in favor of the networks' compliance requirements.\n\nOur clients evaluating these products for actual use have found the compliance question is the important one. Who's the card issuer? What jurisdiction? What happens when the issuer's banking partner gets nervous about crypto associations? Several crypto card programs have been shut down abruptly when their BIN sponsor or issuing bank pulled out.\n\nThe sustainable versions of this are the ones with proper licensing and institutional backing. The ones promising privacy and bank-independence while using Visa are selling a contradiction.",

They tokenize 30 or 40% of the estate's value, and with your investment they will have to pay you interest/APR. They can also give you free wine of your choosing once a year, and you can stay in that little shed/house on the farm for free for a few nights. The difference with tokenization is that the benefits can literally be anything, like communal trade of some sort, and then your wine friends will be able to buy back the investment later down the line, or you can trade it to another person, usually tokenization platforms will have their own secondary markets. So in theory you are guaranteed to make money back (because the estate doesn't just disappear and the value wont ever just drop, and eventually the wine farm would want to buy back all the tokens) and on top of that you can get free wine and a hotel room, depending on if the issuer is generous or not with their listing.",

      "text": "**Intro:** Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been working on a fintech project aimed at solving \"earnings season fatigue.\" We all know the standard data (EPS, Revenue) is easy to get, but the **qualitative risks** hidden in 10-Qs and earnings calls are often missed by retail investors.\n\nI’ve designed three core features to tackle this using LLMs and data visualization. I’d love to get the community’s thoughts on the utility and the UI:\n\n**1. AI Risk Radar (The \"Red Flag\" Engine):** Instead of just sentiment analysis, this engine looks for anomalies like inventory spikes vs. revenue growth, or subtle shifts in management’s vocabulary compared to the last 4 quarters. It generates a \"Risk Score\" and explains the \"Why\" in plain English.\n\n**2. Real-time Earnings Call Insights:** A live-streaming transcript service that doesn't just transcribe, but \"tags\" management answers. If an executive becomes evasive or uses language historically linked to negative future performance, the UI flags it in real-time.\n\n**3. Visual Volatility Calendar:** A dashboard to map out upcoming earnings for a specific watchlist, focusing on expected volatility rather than just the date.\n\n**The Question for** r/FinTech\\*\\*:\\*\\*\n\n* **As professionals/enthusiasts:** Do you think a \"Risk Score\" is too reductive for investors, or is the \"Key Red Flags\" list more valuable?\n* **Regarding the Live Insights:** Would you find real-time flagging distracting, or is it the \"killer feature\" for someone who can't listen to every word?\n\n**I've attached some UI mockups below to show the current direction. Any feedback on the UX or the underlying logic would be hugely appreciated!**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uye4o6ocszhg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f28e706c9e91cf08e291817957f5a8eead6cbb3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ymlyu6ocszhg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=daababae84ed822522f7ba26ecf0064dcc7783e2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w9xoa7ocszhg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=91b0d6cdc7b52ef4335ed46dbefb85757a9b5deb",
