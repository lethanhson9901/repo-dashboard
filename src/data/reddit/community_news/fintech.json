We always ended up needing our own internal audit trail and KYC proprietary processes that sat alongside those vendors to track the overall KYC state and additional data (including documents), which we built on [Luther](https://www.reddit.com/r/luthersystems/).

          "text": "The \"moves work from analysts to QA\" trap is exactly the right concern. Most automation in this space just shifts the bottleneck rather than eliminating it.\n\nWhat actually works versus what vendors claim based on what our clients have piloted.\n\nThe document chasing and completeness checking part automates reasonably well. Rules-based workflows that detect missing docs, send templated requests, and track response status are mature enough to trust. This is the lowest-risk automation because the failure mode is just asking for something you already have, not making a compliance decision.\n\nEvidence gathering and case packaging is where things get interesting. The newer agent-based tools can pull registry data, cross-reference sanctions lists, and assemble supporting docs into a coherent case file. When it works, it saves hours per case. When it doesn't, it confidently assembles garbage that looks complete but isn't. The key differentiator is whether the tool surfaces confidence levels and provenance for each piece of evidence. If it just hands you a finished package without showing its work, you're back to reviewing everything manually anyway.\n\nThe explainability requirement is where most tools fail compliance scrutiny. Regulators want to understand why a decision was made, not just what decision was made. If your automation layer is a black box that outputs \"approve\" or \"refer to analyst,\" you haven't reduced compliance burden, you've added a system you now need to justify. The tools that work in regulated environments generate step-by-step reasoning tied to specific policy criteria, essentially showing their homework.\n\nWhat to actually test in a pilot. Give it your messiest 10% of cases, the ones with inconsistent names, partial docs, or edge-case entity structures. If it handles those gracefully with clear escalation logic, it'll handle the easy 90%. If it chokes or produces garbage, you know the ceiling.",

SAR filing is a nightmare. every report takes 2+ hours because we have to manually compile evidence from like 6 different sources. and the regulators... look i get it, crypto is high risk. but the scrutiny means we need PERFECT audit trails and our current setup is duct tape and prayers. we tried chainalysis for on-chain stuff (decent), elliptic (meh), looked at sumsub and jumio for KYC but they're not really built for our workflow. recently heard about sphinxhq and sardine being more crypto-native but haven't tried them yet. what's actually working for crypto compliance teams? especially for alert triage and SAR automation? i'm losing my mind over here",

When analysts have to jump between on-chain analytics, KYC tools, and case management, everything slows down and audit trails get messy. Teams that centralize identity data + transaction context in one place see alerts automatically enriched and cases don’t have to be manually rebuilt.\n\nA few things that matter specifically for crypto:\n\n• **Configurable rules per business model** — flows can be tuned differently for CEXs, on/off-ramps, custody providers, OTC desks, etc., instead of relying on a single generic setup.  \n• **Automated alert triage & evidence collection** — reduces false positives and cuts down SAR/STR prep time because the supporting data is already attached.  \n• **BYOK** — encryption keys stay with the client, which helps with security and regulator scrutiny.\n\nNo tool removes all the pain of crypto compliance, but consolidating data and automating the mechanical work usually gets teams out of “duct tape and prayers” mode.\n\nDrop us a line if there are more details to share on the case — happy to help!",

Models should be explainable, testable, and defensible to regulators, \"it works most of the time\" is not acceptable when money and compliance are at stake.\n\n**Data is messy and fragmented.** Financial data lives across multiple systems, jurisdictions, and formats; cleaning, labeling, and aligning it takes more time than building the model itself.\n\n**Trust is binary.** A small error rate that's fine in marketing or recommendations can be catastrophic in payments, credit, or fraud.\n\n\\-> Ways teams I’ve worked with have progressed\n\n\\- Employ **AI in decision support** rather than in decision making itself (risk rating, outlier identification, prioritizing).\n\n\\- This is the time ships are queued for **human-in-loop** workflows so that humans are always accountable.\n\n\\- **Prove reliability** on small to well-defined applications before scaling.

          "text": "It's slow because the cost of being wrong is actually high, unlike most software where you ship fast and fix bugs later.\n\nThe core tension is that ML systems fail in ways that are hard to predict and explain. A recommendation engine showing you weird products is embarrassing. A credit model denying someone a loan for reasons you can't articulate to a regulator is a lawsuit. That asymmetry changes everything about how you build.\n\nData issues are usually the first wall. Financial data is messy, siloed, and covered in access restrictions. You spend months just getting a clean training dataset that compliance will let you use. Our clients building ML features typically budget more time for data pipeline work than actual model development, which feels backwards but reflects reality.\n\nThe explainability requirement kills a lot of approaches that would otherwise work. You can build a fraud model with great AUC but if you can't explain why it flagged a specific transaction, you can't deploy it. This pushes you toward simpler models or hybrid systems where ML does the scoring but rules handle the edge cases. Less elegant, more shippable.\n\nCompliance review adds cycles that don't exist in other industries. Model risk management wants to understand your training data, validation approach, monitoring plan, and fallback procedures. Depending on the use case this can add months to a launch timeline. Not because anyone's being obstructionist, but because the regulations actually require this diligence.\n\nWhat actually moves faster is starting with automation that assists humans rather than replaces decisions. Document extraction, anomaly flagging for human review, case prioritization. These are lower risk because a human still makes the final call. You build trust with compliance and operations teams, then gradually expand the automation boundary as you prove reliability.\n\nThe teams that ship quickly in fintech usually aren't moving fast on novel ML, they're moving fast on well-understood patterns with strong monitoring and easy rollback.",

          "text": "Yeah, this is a real thing. On paper, fintech looks like the easiest win for AI, but in practice, it moves at a crawl.\n\nA big part of it is that money + regulation + user trust is a brutal combo. You can’t just ship something that’s “mostly right” when it touches credit decisions, fraud flags, pricing, or compliance reporting. If your model makes a weird call, you don’t just annoy a user you might break a law, trigger an audit, or cost someone real money. That makes everyone super cautious.\n\nFrom my experience, the data side is often the bigger blocker than the model side. Fintech data is messy, siloed, and full of edge cases. You spend months just figuring out what fields actually mean, whether they’re consistent, and if you’re even allowed to use them. Then legal/compliance has to sign off on everything, which is slow but kind of necessary.\n\nOne example: we tried to add a simple ML-based fraud scoring tweak. The model itself worked fine in testing. What slowed us down was explaining it to compliance in a way they could defend to regulators, building audit logs, and adding manual review fallbacks for edge cases. That turned a “few weeks of modeling” into a multi-month project.\n\nThe trade-off is speed vs. safety. You can move fast if it’s internal tooling or decision support for humans. The moment it affects customers directly, you slow way down. It also depends on the company’s risk tolerance and how regulated their product is (payments vs. lending vs. crypto, etc.).\n\nThe practical takeaway: most teams balance innovation by shipping boring, constrained versions first narrow scope, lots of guardrails, human-in-the-loop. It’s not exciting, but it’s the only way to build trust and not get burned.",

While they support it, it’s an early product that they are very carefully selecting clients for. So if you go that route be ready to cough up a lot of authoritative documentation explaining what you’re doing, how you’re doing it, how you’re monitoring it, your audit process, audits you’ve had done, your legal counsel’s opinion (probably not required but they’d like to have it), diagrams and more.\n\nI recall some comment from someone at some point saying Moov was good. Given your scenario though you’re probably going to get a lot of due diligence from them too.\n\nDefinitely look into every state’s money transmitter laws where you’re operating. An MTL would probably help land a service provider or partner if that fits your scenario.\n\nYou can try local banks if you’re small but they’d be taking a risk on you committing fraud, money laundering, etc. WebBank and Cross River Bank are common fintech partners though I can’t speak to what they’ll require from you.",

The alternatives either won't talk to you at your volume or have worse tradeoffs.\n\nMoov is worth a conversation. They're more developer-friendly than legacy ACH processors and their identity verification flow is cleaner than full merchant onboarding. They're also more willing to work with early-stage companies than Dwolla. The catch is you're still dealing with the same underlying regulatory requirements, so \"lighter onboarding\" has limits when you're moving money between consumers.\n\nGoCardless is primarily designed for recurring payments and payee collection, not two-way P2P. The UX assumes a business is pulling from customers, not peers settling obligations. Probably not a fit unless you contort your flows significantly.\n\nSeamless Chex is more of a verification and risk tool than a payment processor. You'd still need actual rails.\n\nThe regulatory reality you need to internalize is that P2P consumer payments in the US trigger money transmission concerns. The reason Dwolla bounced you isn't just volume, it's that their compliance setup for consumer-to-consumer flows is heavier than B2B. Stripe Connect's \"merchant\" framing exists partly because treating recipients as merchants rather than random consumers simplifies their regulatory position.\n\nSponsor bank and BaaS relationships at your stage are tough. Unit, Treasury Prime, and similar players generally want to see product-market fit and some volume trajectory before engaging. You're looking at months of integration work even if they said yes today.\n\nOur clients in similar positions usually start with Stripe, accept the imperfect UX, and plan to migrate once volume justifies better options. Ripping out payments later is painful but less painful than spending six months trying to find the perfect early-stage solution that doesn't exist.",

After looking at a few providers, I’ve settled on using **Plaid** for account linking and **Column** for the actual banking infrastructure (ACH and internal Book Transfers).\n\n**The Workflow:**\n\n1. **Plaid:** Users link their external bank (Chase, Wells Fargo, etc.) and give us a processor token.\n2. **Column:** We use that token to create a Counterparty and trigger ACH pulls/pushes.\n3. **Internal:** We use Column’s Book Transfers for instant P2P movement within our app.\n\n**My Questions for the Community:**\n\n* Has anyone worked with this specific combination in production? How was the developer experience?\n* Specifically, how do you handle the 2-day ACH settlement gap? Do you let users spend \"pending\" funds, or is that a recipe for disaster?\n* Are there any \"hidden\" pitfalls with Column’s KYC (Entity) onboarding flow that I should know about now?\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who has navigated these APIs before. Thanks in advance!",

We don’t trigger any action with customer money until the ACH transfer reaches a settled state - unless we have good reason to believe the money will be there and we trust the customer, in which case a posted status at a minimum.\n\nPending can still fail and then you’re out the money, but that’s a risk assessment you’ll have to make. Definitely don’t ignore failures that can occur and especially don’t ignore ACH returns.\n\nPlaid’s KYC is decent but we don’t onboard companies. Can’t speak to Column’s KYC.",

It didn't take much digging to figure out that Brex and Ramp are category leaders. So far the latter a better fit for us rn. Any suggestions on how to navigate the corporate card landscape for early stage folks?",

We've been using them for quite a while now and they're great  \nTheir cards are amazing and you can set limits per vendor/merchant as well as budget limit so that employees can use it for specific vendors only. It's easy to integrate it with Quickbooks/Netsuite as well and the receipts are auto matched so it's super easy instead of doing it manually",

It’s very “set it and forget it” for basic controls.\n\nPayEm tends to shine once you care more about control and structure. things like tighter per-card rules, approval flows before spend, and cleaner accounting handoff. It’s less rewards-driven and more finance-led, which can actually be a plus as teams scale and spend gets messier.\n\nIf your sales team is growing fast and you want fewer surprises showing up at month end, PayEm is worth a serious look alongside Ramp.",

The real pain is you end up fact-checking everything anyway which defeats the purpose. Honestly if you want something that actually works, you need a tool that's built specifically for markets and pulls from real sources like SEC filings and actual exchange data instead of just scraping the internet, which is why something like Lattice actually solves this problem way better than ChatGPT ever will.",

The problem that I have with people pitching \"AI for stock research\" is that most people don't have domain expertise in investing.\n\nFor a sell-side analyst, putting out research reports (and their quality) is just about the least important part of what they do. A research analyst (aside from the weird European MiFID rules) does not drive revenue to the firm by putting out good research. They drive revenue to the firm by having the best coverage of companies (for quickest updates and NDRs). The guy/gal who covers and researches Nvidia really well isn't going to get business over the researcher who is best connected to the entire c-suite at Nvidia and can easily get an investor roadshow for his/her clients at any time.\n\nFor buy-side, discretionary, fundamental single-stock picking firms are pretty much dead at this point. No one is pitching stocks to allocate 10% of a portfolio into anymore (and haven't for well over a decade). I'm sure you could use AI for some orchestration over proprietary quant tools, but that would require building a full quant infrastructure first before the AI stuff.",
