Shipping completely breaks that illusion.\n\nBuilding is logic. Distribution is psychology. And psychology is messy.\n\nGetting even the first 50–100 signups for a *new* concept feels harder than writing the product itself, especially when there’s no existing category or demand to ride on. Selling in theory feels easy; selling *your own thing* is emotionally brutal because every “no” feels personal.\n\nMy first dollar didn’t come from scaling or funnels, it came from manually talking to users, understanding why they *didn’t* care yet, and reshaping the story until one person finally did.\n\nCurious to hear others’ stories too, first dollar moments are wildly different, but they all seem to involve discomfort.",

Since then, we’ve been going through pivot hell.\n\nNow we want to change our approach, inspired by the Y Combinator video “How to Get Startup Ideas” (the one where they tell the story of AtoB). We’re wondering if we can copy that approach and search for a fertile “idea space” instead of chasing random concepts.\n\nSo far, we think a good idea space should be:\n\n* Targetable (clear ICP, easy to reach)\n* In a growing market\n* Preferably “boring” (not overcrowded or hyped)\n\nWe’re trying to define more attributes that make an idea space attractive before jumping into execution.\n\nHas anyone here intentionally searched for an idea space like this?  \nWhat criteria did you use?  \nAnd what worked (or didn’t work) in practice?\n\nWould really appreciate hearing about your experience.",

Paid ads brought traffic but not real users. Nothing felt repeatable.\n\nThe first channel that moved the needle for us was talking to founders where they already complain about support, chat, and lead drop offs. Reddit threads, indie hacker type communities, and a few founder Slack groups. I did not pitch. I helped debug their funnel or onboarding and only mentioned {{Name}} when it was genuinely relevant.\n\nIt took around 6 to 8 weeks before this felt predictable.

I work with SaaS founders and enterprise firms to help them create video content with my studio WhatAStory and I realise that mot times reverse engineering content from your distribution strategy is the trick.

Instead of “campaigns,” I did 15–20 1:1 rescues: “I’ll fix X this week if you let me watch and ask questions.” Those became testimonials, case studies, and very narrow landing pages that finally made paid and outbound work. Tools like SparkToro, F5bot, and later Pulse for Reddit helped me systematically find those complaint threads instead of guessing.

Every tool I found for tracking symptoms was either clunky, ad-heavy, or lacked the specific medical assessments we actually need to show our neurologists.\n\nSo, I built a dedicated platform for the community.

I’m not here to sell anything; I’m here to share the reality of launching a niche, mission-driven project.\n\n**The \"Day 4\" Numbers:**\n\n* **Organic Growth:** 500+ unique visitors with $0 spent on marketing.\n* **Retention Signal:** Average session duration is 5**m 50s**.\n* **Bounce rate**: 30%\n\n**Why I’m sharing this here:** A lot of entrepreneurship is about finding a massive market, but there is something to be said for building deep for a small, underserved community.\n\n**I’d love to hear from other founders:**\n\n1.

Your early numbers are stronger than you think. 500+ organic visitors in 4 days in a condition affecting \\~14 per 100,000 is meaningful signal. A 5m 50s average session duration in health tracking is very high intent. 30% bounce rate is strong for cold traffic; most early-stage health tools see 45–70%. That suggests visitors are exploring, not skimming. On trust: radical transparency wins. Publicly document how data is stored, whether it’s encrypted at rest and in transit, who has access, and what happens if you shut down. Add a plain-English privacy page. In rare disease markets, reputation spreads fast. One respected neurologist or patient advocate mentioning you can drive more adoption than paid ads. On scale: 2–3M global TAM is not small if engagement is deep. If even 5% adopt and 20% of those become power users, you have tens of thousands of high-LTV users. Rare niches scale horizontally too. Once infrastructure exists, adjacent autoimmune conditions with fluctuation-based tracking (MS, lupus, Crohn’s) become natural expansion paths. Depth first, then adjacency. Your retention metrics suggest you’re solving a real pain. Keep talking to users weekly and track activation rate next.",

      "text": "I think I’m looking for other frank perspectives. I feel stupid and lost about what to do with one non-technical co-founder. My fault.\n\n**Background**\n\nYour typical excited college friends who lived together in the same house for 4+ years and wanted to “build the future.” We didn’t know anything, so we started building after “validating” by filling out a startup book’s boxes. (Ik..we're naive.) We’ve been at it about 2 years. We’re bad at distribution, but we’ve built a good product with a handful of paying users after multiple pivots. (yep..delusional, but we strongly believe.)\n\n**Good characteristics**\n\n* Extremely trustworthy, honest, kind, owns mistakes, tries to be fair\n* Quit her job for this and took a part-time job\n* Can really hustle when it makes sense. Amazing to work besides\n* Tries to fill skill gaps\n* Fairly smart and likes to be fast (beginning stage)\n\n**Warning signs to me**\n\n* Prefers planning over doing\n* Goes on vacation that take weeks\n* Avoids trying if she thinks it might fail and gives up after a few attempts\n* Works in bursts: strong start then silence\n* Assumes data and users instead of doing the work to get them\n* Stopped working for 7 months due to lost faith\n* Very slow on tasks over time and had to do them myself\n* Talks more than executes. Expects others to do the work\n* Repeats questions that I’ve already answered\n* Poor communication. Rather go quiet unless messaged (others have called her out on this multiple times)\n* Doesn’t want to leave now because she sees the potential (Share is 1 year vested after 1 year cliff)\n* Talks about raising but doesn’t take action\n\n**In her defense**\n\n* Been going on for almost 2 years with no success\n* Every action to grow in the past year has been met with failure and no major wins\n* Contributed $2k+ as well for api costs and marketing\n* Personal expenses adding up\n\n**My thought**\n\nDespite the warnings, I trust her deeply. I see her potential from living with her and past hustle experiences. I know co-founder betrayal stories are common so I'm thinking that I'm very lucky. \n\nBut I’ve heard “If the company is not making money, you’re worth nothing” So is it fair for me to judge her value when I’m also not driving revenue? My current hat after the tech is marketing which I've failed at for about a year straight. But, I kept experimenting to know what works now. We're close, just need to do more at scale.\n\n**Issue**\n\nI spoke with her directly and she appreciated my call out, admitted fault, agreed to a plan, and asked me to hold her accountable. I want to call for a vote if she reverts back again, but I feel uncertain. My other two co-founders like her a lot as a person and really wanted to avoid the topic when I asked them about kicking her out. \n\nAnyone here with a similar situation? Did you do a final hail mary and discuss it in the general chat? Or did the co-founder end up pulling through, making your patience worth it?",

One partner is responsible for the core technical architecture.\n\n3. The other two were brought on to assist with various tasks.\n\nInitially, we wanted to be fair, so we all called ourselves co-founders and gave everyone that title. However, we eventually realized that only the technical lead and I were actually putting in the work and treating this as a career. The other two still prioritize schoolwork.\n\nThey don't dedicate much time to the project and often disappear for a week or two during midterms or finals—usually right when we're facing our most critical and severe bugs.\n\nWhile this issue hasn't been fully resolved yet, we are currently working on it. I feel we need to find an opportunity to sit down and discuss a formal Founder Agreement to define exactly how much time and effort everyone should be contributing.\n\nWe are currently discussing a potential exit for those who can't meet the required work and time commitments.

What helped was communicating publicly over time so that they can see how much they're falling behind.

You're empathizing with her which is understandable, but at the end of the day the team is trying to build a business which requires A LOT of hard work, revenue or not. In that sense, she's not being fair to you by not showing up.\n\nOn trust. Trust has 2 components\n- Trust in their intentions (what you're talking about, ex they're a good person)\n- Trust in their ability to execute (this is the problem)\n\nAlso, as someone who's gone thru a cofounder breakup: \n\nBreakups don't happen as huge dramatic fights. They happen from silent resentment that stews from months/years of not having the tough convos. Things like \"goes quiet unless messaged\". Hundreds of paper cuts of emotional debt that goes unpaid until cracks in the relationship start to show.\n\nAgree with you that you should put a vote if it happens again. Your other cofounders are avoiding the confrontation but it'll end up more painful by dragging it on. Just my 2c!\n",

You've planted the seed that she's a risk and it's a matter of time before she drops the ball. It's going to mess up your focus (speaking from experience).

That's a switching cost that compounds over time and competitors can't replicate on day one.\n\nCommunity features feel tempting but bolting on social stuff to a utility usually feels forced and users ignore it. Instead think about integrations. Make your app plug into workflows people already depend on so ripping it out becomes painful. That's a structural moat not a feature gimmick.\n\nThe arms race never ends regardless though. Accept that and just stay ahead.

A truly exciting idea with a credible founder attracts co-founders who believe in the upside. If nobody's willing to bet on you, either the idea needs more validation or you need to build more credibility first.\n\nBuild the MVP yourself or with the cheapest resources possible. Learn no-code tools, hire a freelancer for the technical pieces you can't handle, and get something live that proves the concept works. A working prototype with real users is worth more than any pitch deck when recruiting co-founders. People join things that are already moving, not ideas on paper.\n\nStop looking for a full team before you've proven anything.

Who's been complaining about this problem in forums, Slack groups, LinkedIn posts? Those people don't need to be convinced the problem is real — they're living it. That shared conviction is worth more than any equity split negotiation.\n\n3. The salary conversation is actually a filter, not a problem\n\nWhen a potential co-founder leads with \"I need salary from day one,\" that's information. It doesn't make them a bad person — it just tells you where they are in their life right now. They might have a mortgage, kids, aging parents. Totally valid.\n\nBut here's the thing: if someone genuinely believes in what you're building, the conversation shifts from \"what's my salary?\" to \"how do we make this work?\" \n\nThe founders who built legendary companies together figured out creative solutions — consulting arrangements, part-time commitments while keeping their job, deferred compensation structures, or one person staying employed while the other goes full-time. \n\nIf someone can't get creative with you on structure, they probably won't get creative with you when the startup hits its first wall. And it will hit a wall.\n\n4. Reduce the ask dramatically\n\nDon't ask someone to quit their job and co-found a company with you. That's a massive ask with almost no proof of concept.\n\nInstead, ask for a weekend. Ask them to help you build the MVP over 30 days while keeping their job. Ask for a small commitment with a clear end date and a clear milestone. \n\n\"Help me get to 100 users and then let's have the real conversation\" is a much easier yes than \"leave your stable income for my idea.\"\n\nA lot of the best co-founder relationships I've seen started as a trial period. No pressure, no big commitment — just two people figuring out if they work well together.\n\n5. Your network is your recruiting pool — expand it deliberately\n\nThis is where I get a little passionate, because it's exactly why I built Angel Squad. \n\nThe founders who find great early teams quickly are almost always the ones who've been \\*in community\\* before they needed anything. They've been showing up to events, helping others, sharing knowledge, building relationships without an agenda.\n\nWhen you need a CTO and you've spent the last year genuinely connecting with engineers, developers, and technical folks — you have people to call. When you need a co-founder and you've been lurking silently? You're starting from zero.\n\nInvest in community before you need it. Seriously.\n\n\n\nBuilding a founding team when you have nothing but a vision is a sales job. You're selling your conviction, your work ethic, and your judgment. \n\nThe founders who crack this aren't necessarily the ones with the best ideas. They're the ones who've done enough groundwork that joining them feels less like a leap of faith and more like an obvious opportunity.\n\nGet something real in front of people. Make it easier to say yes. And find people who are already losing sleep over the same problem you are. That's your founding team.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I’d love some honest advice from founders who’ve been here.\n\nWe’re building a B2C EdTech startup in a specific study/learning vertical.\n\nOur product is, in our opinion, significantly better than our main competitor in the same niche (better UX, better features, better retention once users try it).\n\nThe problem is distribution and scale.\n\nFor our launch, we used about €4,000 in marketing/product efforts, and we reached payback in around 7 months. Right now we’re at roughly €600 MRR.\n\nSo the situation is weird:\n\n\t•\tWe have a product that works\n\n\t•\tUnit economics are not terrible\n\n\t•\tBut we only have about €6k left in the bank\n\n\t•\tWe are fundraising, but it’s hard because:\n\n\t•\tVCs don’t love B2C\n\n\t•\tVCs don’t love EdTech\n\n\t•\tOur size is still very small\n\nAlso, the founders are currently not paying ourselves, so we’re basically working for free.\n\nWe feel stuck in a limbo:\n\n\t•\tnot big enough to attract serious capital\n\n\t•\tnot funded enough to scale fast\n\n\t•\tnot dead either, because the product actually has traction\n\nI’m considering a few options and I’d love your opinion:\n\n\t1.\tExpand into B2B (schools, tutors, training centers, etc.) to improve cash flow and credibility\n\n\t2.\tStay focused on B2C and push harder on one acquisition channel\n\n\t3.\tBuild adjacent micro-apps in the same vertical (basically cloning parts of our product into more focused tools), to capture users with a single specific need and funnel them into the main product\n\n\t4.\tSomething else I’m not seeing\n\nIf you were in this position, what would you do in the next 3–6 months?",

          "text": "\"VCs don’t love B2C  \nVCs don’t love EdTech\" There are many things a VC will say they do not like; however, there is only really one thing they do like, makinig a return on their investment, the more return a business can make them, the better. Such a love is universal. So then all you would ever need to do is show a VC you are capable of making them money in the future. If after showing a VC your profit potential they are still not intrested in your business, it either means you have overestimated your future profits by a wide margin, or you were incapable of effectivly articulating your products value.\n\n\"not big enough to attract serious capital  \nnot funded enough to scale fast  \nnot dead either, because the product actually has traction\" Every business goes through this stage. It is not possible for a business to go from a startup to a business big enough for serious capital, without first transitioning through a period where they were not big enough for serious capital.\n\n\"I’m considering a few options....... Expand into B2B\" May I ask why you havent already expanded into B2B?",

      "text": "Hi guys I wanted to ask for help on career advice that maybe some of you can relate to.\n\nI am a couple years out of undergrad where I studied computer engineering, and interned at big tech and startup in the West Coast. Right after college I joined my family business (manufacturing and wholesale of CPG), and I’ve done decently well. At this point I am done following my family’s footsteps and I am interested in pursuing working in the tech industry again, esp with all of the exciting AI Startups now (would be a dream to get into YC and start a software startup of my own).\n\nI have been experimenting with vibe coding tools like cursor and Claude, and I have been making some prototypes for a B2B saas idea. I understand that for it to truly be a legit software startup, I am nowhere close to that.\n\nI was thinking that I should get a job within a tech startup/corporate first in order to learn the ropes so that I would have the right experience to start my own thing. I have a few classmates from college in YC but I personally don’t feel I have the chops they’re hiring for, since they’re hiring ppl from big tech. It’s been several years so I’ve incredibly rusty in my technical skills, and I have high doubts about my employability since ive only worked in B2B sales and distribution in the physical product space, and idk how transferable any of my skills are from my family business. I know that currently the tech industry is not doing well in terms of hiring people.\n\nShould I go to grad school and get enough technical skills for me to start my own startup, or am I just fantasizing about the AI boom at the moment and I should just be realistic and stick with my family business that is already doing well? I am just so fascinated by all the advancements of AI that I would honestly love to be part of this societal growth and I do not have much interest in my family industry at all.\n\nAny feedback or advice is absolutely appreciated. I understand this sort of post is a bit different from the other posts and I will accept the hate but this is a genuine struggle that I have been dealing with for months. Thank you so much",

Reddit comments (not posts)\n2. Answering questions in relevant threads\n3. Showing product in context (not “hey try my tool”)\n4. A small free usage model\n\nI avoided:\n\n* Cold DMs\n* Paid ads\n* “Check my startup” posts\n* Spammy links\n\nMost users came from conversations where video creation was the real problem being discussed.\n\n# What surprised me\n\n# 1.) Free users don’t convert just because they signed up\n\nMost users just try once and disappear.\n\nLesson:  \nSignups ≠ validation.\n\n# 2.) Pricing matters more than features\n\nMy pricing was messy in the beginning.\n\nWhen you’re small, simplicity > flexibility.\n\nToo many options confuses people.\n\n# 3.) Payment friction kills small revenue\n\nWhen someone is paying $1–$5, payment fees and failures matter a lot.\n\nMicro-payments are brutal.\n\n# 4.) 2 paying users felt bigger than 266 signups\n\nBecause that means:\n\nSomeone saw value.  \nSomeone trusted enough to enter card details.  \nSomeone actually needed the product.\n\nThat changes mindset completely.\n\n# Biggest learning\n\nGetting users is easier than getting paid users.\n\nPeople will try tools.  \nVery few will pay.\n\nThe real game starts after first revenue.\n\n# What I’m experimenting next\n\n* Simpler pricing (maybe one plan only)\n* Limited free usage instead of generous credits\n* Talking directly to paid users to understand why they converted\n* Improving positioning (less “cool tech”, more “clear outcome”)\n\nIf you’ve gone from 0 → first paying customers recently,  \nwhat changed for you?\n\nWould love to learn from others building in this stage.",

If we open a C-Corp, raise a round, issue equity, and proceed…GREAT if it works. But if startup fails, we’ve escalated structure and dilution earlier than we might otherwise.\n\nHesitation isn’t about belief in the product. It’s about timing and structure.\n\nQuestions for founders who’ve been here:\n\n1.\tIs converting to a C-Corp and accepting early dilution justified at this stage for an anchor partner? What if they don’t actually proceed (they know how early we are)\n\n2 should we say ‘bye’ to this prospect and find first clean enterprise pilot client (no equity loss) to get more leverage with investors?\n\n3 what if we can’t close with investors and we’re stuck with this C-corp?\n\n4 How painful (and costly) is it realistically if a C-Corp needs to be shut  down and you’ve issued stock?\n\n5 Both founders financial runway is low, what if we get freelance or full time jobs, can/should we still operate a c corp?\n\nLooking for grounded feedback from people who’ve navigated this fork.",

          "text": "On the C-Corp timing question:\n\nIncorporating as a C-Corp is inevitable if you're going to raise VC money and scale. The question is just \\*when\\*. The cost of incorporating (Stripe Atlas, Clerky, etc.) is like $500-2k. That's not the scary part. The scary part is issuing equity before you have clarity on valuation and terms.\n\n\n\nOn the anchor partner wanting equity:\n\nThis is a yellow flag for me. Pilot customers paying for pilots = normal. Pilot customers taking equity = complicated. A few things to think through:\n\n\\- What % are they asking for? If it's meaningful, that's a problem for future investors who will see that cap table and ask questions\n\n\\- Is this actually their standard ask, or is this an accelerator trying to extract value from their portfolio companies?\n\n\\- Have you talked to other founders who went through this same accelerator?\n\n\n\nOn your specific questions:\n\n1. Early dilution to an anchor partner is only justified if they're a genuine reference customer who will actively sell for you, not just use you. \"Willing to move forward\" is not the same as \"will be our champion and close our next 10 deals\"\n\n2. I wouldn't say bye yet, but I'd push back hard on the equity piece. Negotiate. The pilot payment should be enough for a stage-appropriate relationship. If they won't move without equity, that tells you something about how they see the power dynamic here.\n\n3. Stuck with a C-Corp and no investors is annoying but manageable. You can keep it dormant cheaply. Delaware franchise taxes are the main cost (\\~$400/yr minimum). Not a catastrophe.\n\n4. Shutting down a C-Corp with issued stock requires consent from stockholders, filing dissolution paperwork, and potentially some legal fees. Painful? Moderate. Expensive? A few thousand dollars if it's clean. The messier the cap table, the messier the wind-down.\n\n5. Yes, absolutely you can hold jobs and operate a C-Corp. Tons of founders do this. Just make sure your employment agreements don't have IP assignment clauses that would conflict. Read those carefully.\n\n\n\nThe real risk here isn't the C-Corp structure. It's anchoring your entire fundraising narrative to one client who is giving you conditional signals. Investors are going to ask \"what's the status with your anchor customer?\" and \"we're in conversations\" is a weak answer that can actually hurt you.\n\nIf you're going to go down this path, get something in writing from them first. An LOI, a signed pilot agreement, \\*something\\* before you restructure your company around their requirements.",

              "text": "incredible feedback. Thank you.. here goes:\n\non the anchor partner wanting equity: they haven't given the number yet. But its a risk thing for them. Also they see it as an opportunity cost for leveraging their name/reputational value. And its them seeing the future value and wanting a piece. Its an accelerator/incubator piece of a large institution. I have not talked to others who went through it, but will look and see if I can find.\n\n1. they will be genuine reference partner. Will negotiate hard to get several ideas in writing for this. They will not sell for us, but I'd want them in the sales process as reference/case study on calls etc\n\n2. Will push hard / negotiate.\n\n3. Good to know, I've heard similar.\n\n4. Great insight.. so if for some reason a stockholder says no then you cannot shut it down? and you're stuck with operational fees each year because of it? unless you have a smart clause in a contract.\n\n5. ok got it. \n\nThis anchor prospect is the furthest along .. we have others in the pipeline we're warming up. No surprise, but what we do need is data / case study as soon as possible to leverage with others. Am going to ask for an LOI yes..\n\n  \n",
