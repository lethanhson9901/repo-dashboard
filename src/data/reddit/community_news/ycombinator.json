Docs are written.\n\nNow I'm staring at the part I have zero skills in: actually getting users.\n\nI've read all the \"just do content marketing and SEO\" advice but I'd love to hear from people who've actually been in the trenches:\n\n- What got you your first 10 users? First 100?\n- What did you try that completely flopped?\n- For developer tools specifically, where did you actually find your audience?\n- How do you know when to keep pushing vs when to call it quits?\n\nI can put money into marketing but I dont want to spend money on a product that isnt viable.

Gets messy fast.\n* **Repeatability** — Every time you need fresh data, you're re-prompting and hoping it's consistent. My tool saves your schema so it's one click to regenerate.\n* **CI/CD pipelines** — You can't put \"ask Cursor\" in your build script. REST API call works anywhere.\n* **Pro tier** — Save your database connection locally and load directly. No copy-paste.\n\nFor a solo dev loading one table once? Yeah, Cursor is fine.

This strategy takes a while but interested folks will start to reach out if your problem is a compelling one.\n\n3) where do developers like you congregate? Reddit? X? Somewhere else? Post there about your solution and ask for validation (like what you did here, great post), feedback, etc. DM and follow up to see how it went. If folks don’t bother to ask or even use it, that’s some great feedback right there.\n\nI would do these way before doing like paid ads or actual website SEO.",

Started with literally **0 customer conversations**, course-corrected hard, now at \\~**$500 MRR** and growing slowly. \n\n**What actually got my first users**\n\n**1.  Obsess over the first 5 users, not 100 -** I reached out to **hundreds of people on LinkedIn**. Most ignored me, some were polite, and a handful genuinely cared about the problem. That handful is all that matters. Cold emails and LinkedIn DMs are your best tools early on. If your message clearly speaks to a real pain, the right people *will* reply. Use tools like Clay or HeyReach to find targeted prospects, but start with your existing network first. Those early conversations are faster, warmer, and often your first real believers. \n\n2. **Turn your early users into paid customers** \\- **Do this as soon as possible**. Free users are usually polite, vague, and disappear. The moment someone pays, their behavior changes. They care about getting real value, they give clearer feedback, and they stick around long enough for you to learn. You don’t need perfect pricing. Even a small charge tells you whether the problem is real or just “interesting.” **Make sure your free tier is not too generous!**\n\n3. **Turn happy users into distribution** \\- Ask for referrals, testimonials, and warm intros. If people genuinely like your product, they’re usually happy to help. This compounds faster than any growth hack.\n\n**One hard rule**  \nDo not spend money on marketing before you have meaningful usage. Until you’ve observed things like retention, frequency of use, and why people come back, paid marketing will mostly just help you lose money faster.",

This is a great way to get exposure while staying somewhat ”anonymous”. \n\nWe opened the app up to 50 more on the waitlist. Iterated for a couple of months. Continued with Reddit and started SEO. This helped a lot with messaging and building confidence around how to sell the product. Still working on this everyday, but you gotta start somewhere.\n\nEventually we started getting more interest in the product. Reddit users where asking us for access. And at that point, we decided it was time to stand behind what we built and put it out there. If we get rejection, it is what it is you know?  \n\nWhat’s your product? If you have a website please link it. I can take a look and give you some feedback (I’m technical).\n\nEDIT:\nYou will get rejection and poor reviews early. That is part of it. Not everyone is gonna understand your product nor your vision. But ask yourself this: if you don’t stand behind your product publicly, why would anyone else?",

Direct conversations get you your first users and learning, but SEO, docs, and brand signals are what make those conversations compound instead of resetting to zero every week. Developers tend to trust patterns they see repeatedly, not single touchpoints, so content, search visibility, and consistent positioning quietly lower the friction when you do reach out. Without that backdrop, outreach feels pushy and exhausting because you’re doing all the trust-building manually. The question I’d reflect on is whether your current marketing fear is really about promotion, or about not yet having a repeatable way for people to rediscover and validate the product after the first interaction.",

A great article that can be helpful for you \"How to find and win your first 10 B2B customers\" from Lenny Rachitsky.\n\nGood luck, and have fun!",

If you've nailed this, running campaigns is easy, and why in general it's best to do this alongside building first iteration.\n\nTo answer your specific question, the most valuable thing I've done was setting a goal to speak to say 15 people who I thought were our early adopters every 1-2 weeks. I'd try the channel/source I thought best at the time and blast it.

Ask it to take you through every aspect of a go to market plan for your business. Tell it to ask a question of itself at the end of every thread, and then answer that question simply, giving me options to choose from where necessary. It should provide a concise 1-paragraph summary for its answer and then extended details to review if interested.\n\nThen, when you have the plan complete, take your plan to a vibe coding app and give it the entire thread as a word document. (They parse word better than pdf.) \n\nTell it to build a website (or an app) in a vibe project with an API call to your ChatGPT instance as the website chat bot to answer questions from visitors. You will be amazed how easy and powerful all of this is. You can even embed your app / product into your site for users to remain on one place. Unbelievable. You can even use the AI offered by the vibe tools within the app you build.\n\nIf you’re not vibe coding you’re missing a huge opportunity. In January 2025 I hadn’t coded before. I still haven’t, but as of January 2026 I’ve published 1.6 million lines of code and built a fully functional mvp currently in beta testing with users. We launch in February. It’s not scalable (yet) but as an mvp, it can get you to revenue and early PMF. And that gets you to VC investment. And then you build for scale.\n\nAt least that’s the plan…",

Here are a few truths that hard fought experience will eventually lead you to:\n\n\n1. Building the product was easy because you’re a builder. Turning a product into a company is the actual hard part.\n\n2. There is no way around just talking to people. No digital marketing campaigns or SEO or any other half-baked strategy that really just prevents you from personally hearing “no“. Don’t avoid it, you won’t succeed any other way. And, it’s a numbers game. Your network will get you way more conversations than any cold outreach. And, if you can’t get even 5% of the people you talk to to even respond, then you likely haven’t found a real problem for them.\n\n3. Talk to other engineers, but don’t talk about your product. Don’t even mention it until the second date. Talk about the problem. See if they resonate with the problem your product intends to solve. Learn. Your goal is to get permission to demo, not to tell them about the solution first and hope they love it.\n\n4. Figure out who your actual buyer is. Are you actually a B2B company and need to sell up at the executive level? What is your strategy for getting their approval? How do you frame this as a quantifiable win for the organization? If you validated the product with engineers that are not the buyers, they need to want it so badly they demand their managers to subscribe. This is all strategy that you need to think through.\n\nBest of luck amigo, this is where futures are made.",

          "text": "I don't think anyone is actually sure how to leverage AI to its full capability. But my approach with productivity is to stick with tools that legitimately save me measurable time and automate or streamline long tasks.   \nA couple years back I was barely getting into programming just because I thought AI was cool. I wanted to learn more about it and I knew nothing. After completing Harvard's CS50, I looked at programming with AI as a managerial task rather than a \"do-it-all for me\". Rather than giving Claude or ChatGPT a basic task of \"build this app\", I say something like \"build me this feature for A, we are working on a B structure, for context we have C, and items-to-complete include X, Y, and Z\". When things go wrong, I know where to look and (usually) how because of the narrow scope I place. This saves me (personally) days worth of time as I'm not a great programmer but I understand how to manage work deeply.   \n  \nAs an automations specialist, I feel like I have some advantage because I have experience in automating tasks for my clients so I have more intuition to know when something is worth automating or building vs not. \n\nYou talk about perfecting your setup but in reality there is no \"perfect\" setup. There is no perfect automation or system. But as long as it streamlines the task at least 80% AND its repeatable, then its value can be compounded going into the future.   \n  \nAnd one hack I constantly remind myself to do: Create a literal to-do list every single day. When one task is completed move onto the next and don't stop until the list is finished, then rinse-and-repeat the next day/week. Personally I get distracted very easily and when I'm orchestrating several different tools and completing different tasks, I find that I can very easily become lost in my own work. Keeping a list of to-do's reminds me of where I am and what has been accomplished for the day or week, and more importantly what tools I used (this allows me to see which tools provide the most value to me).",

          "text": "Assuming this is an app or product or something,\n\nIn order:\n1. Write it out\n2. Talk to people who would use it, ask them what they struggle with, understand their pain points and share parts of your idea and see how people respond, what they get excited about and what they don’t really get\n3. If you have competitors read their App Store reviews (or website reviews, wherever people have reviewed similar product) to learn what people complain about / what they love, but what they complain about is more telling \n4. Improve on your idea with your findings. Continue talking to people. Continue improving. Talking to people and applying your findings should be on loop for the entire life of your startup.\n5. Draw mockups, you don’t need to be good at drawing, you just take out a piece of paper and do basic sketches. If it’s an app you draw every screen, literally a rectangle here, a button there, text here. \n6. Mockup should show what happens when someone does xyz. If they hit this button, then you draw the next page of what that button leads to with arrows pointing to it. \n7. If your idea is validated enough, make a no code version. You do this in Figma, or even Canva. It’s very easy to learn (YouTube) and just turn your hand drawn mockups into designs on the computer. \n8. Show your designs to people, get feedback.\n9. I personally recommend doing presentations. I had a slideshow with my designs. Invite a few people over for coffee, drinks, and present your designs / ideas and get lots of feedback and take a ton of notes. I did this multiple times in groups of 3 or 4 with my entire network. It’s also excellent practice if you ever do pitch to investors. \n10. Use that feedback to adjust your designs. \n11. Once you have something great, you can vibe code it yourself with ChatGPT for $20/month. All you have to do is tell ChatGPT you’re a beginner and have no idea where to start and need step by step instructions. At first it’ll be foreign but then you’ll get the hang of it. (Again assuming this is a product you can code). You also could vibe code with Claude code (also $20/month but harder if you’ve never coded before because you have to know how to use Terminal…and what terminal is)\n12. Beta test (have users try out the code version) if its an app you do this with Test Flight\n13. Adjust based on feedback\n14. Test again\n15. Adjust\n16. Launch \n\n\n(Start marketing around stage 11 or 12, ramp up marketing before launch). \n\nTimes are different. You don’t need a cofounder and you don’t need investors. Just have to be hungry to learn. And patient with yourself. \n\nThat being said, if you’re really struggling with design in figma or vibe coding then you can hire people on upwork. And that’s where you might need money. But it no longer takes investors and millions of dollars to build companies or products.  \n\nYou only might seek out investors after you have launched and have users. That’s the only way you don’t have to sell your soul, otherwise you’ll barely own your company by the time you launch. \n\nGood luck! Feel free to DM me if you have more questions. And have fun!!!\n\n——\n\nTalking to people is the biggest thing. Even if you want to be secretive and don’t want to announce it to the world, you can still go to places where people who would use it hang out and ask them about their pain points or what they wish existed. You can still show people you trust. Getting feedback is so important because even if you’ve thought of everything, other people are always going to see something differently and it’s important you know what that different looks like. \n\nFor ex, I had my mom use my product and she was expecting everything to work like Instagram and didn’t understand why certain buttons weren’t working the way Instagram does. I also had another situation where I launched a website and posted a screenshot on my Instagram and one of my mom’s friends literally said “when I click on it it doesn’t open”…she thought you could click on the screenshot to use the website. (I guess on influencer pages you can click an outfit and it opens the website so maybe that’s why she expected that). You just have no idea how some people are going to think about things. If a mom or a 5 year old can get it, you’re golden.\n\nAnd remember, investors = debt. It’s not free money.",

You’ll at least learn a valuable lesson in this case, learning what to build is even harder than learning how to build.\n\nWith experience under a highly competent team that’s moving super fast, where you have access to or are responsible for the entire stack, no brainer go startup if you just want to be able own the entire product yourself.\n\nThe reason to do it is to learn for yourself what works and doesn’t work from both technical and non-technical perspective.\n\nThe base compensation is fine, but the equity is so low relative to the founders, when you’re doing as much if not more work than them, that it begins to feel very unfair quickly. If it takes off, the founders will be set for life and you won’t even though you basically started at the same time. Especially pre-PMF is such a depressing slog, equity should probably be more evenly distributed. And they’ll say oh you salary is better — is that actually true number one and is the difference only like 30k. Is it 100k + 25% equity vs 130k + .5%? That doesn’t seem very fair. Look at what’s happening with these licensing acquisitions like windsurf as well. More ways for that equity to be worthless now even in the case of success for everyone but the founders.\n\nIf your goal is to be a startup person forever and for yourself one day, then it’s a no brainer but mentally prepare for the bad side of startups that people don’t talk about as much.",

Start following and connecting with people in startups, and then follow and connect with who they repost and comment on, and so on. A lot of startups will just recruit on LinkedIn rather than an official job board, so they’ll usually just make a post about it.\n\nEdit: As a note, most of the times I get reached out to, it’s from someone who is a 2 hop connection away from me, i.e. we share a mutual connection. Often times these are just from people I don’t know, but have large and extensive networks of connections. Essentially, connecting with many “influential” people increases exposure.\n\nAlso, your mileage may vary depending on background and skill set.",

It would be nice, but this early in your career, you'll want your key takeaway from this role to be experience; a unique experience that you can't really get anywhere else.\n\nTwo of the best options for new grads are FAANG or YC, but you'll get two very different experiences, each with pros and cons.\n\nSo if you like the people you'll be working with, I'd say go for it. But your primary payout will come in a few years when you're in your mid-20's and can build a startup from scratch; most engineers never get to that point in their career, and you'll have it from the very beginning. That's when your options truly explode. \n\nGood luck!",

You’ll end up picking up a lot of bad habits because nobody is there to guide you or teach you how to build production-level systems. You end up building a bunch of prototypes or throwaway features. It’s better to learn how things are done the right way before jumping to a startup.\n\n2.\tSwitching costs are really low in Silicon Valley. Just do two years at a more established company, then quit to join a startup. You’ll get the senior title later anyway.\n\n3.\tMost startups, even YC-backed ones, are going to fail. Your equity will go to zero. And don’t forget these days, “acqui-hires” happen a lot. You can get screwed even if the founders exit.\n\n4.\tYou’ll work extremely long hours grinding for someone else’s success. Meanwhile, your friends are enjoying their 20s dating and traveling.\n\n5.\tIf you have a few years of experience at a reputable company under your belt, you can go anywhere you want. If you join a startup and find out it’s trash, you can quit and find another job in a month. But if the startup you joined is a mess internally, you’re stuck.\n\n\nMost importantly, you know a company is shit if they can only hire fresh grads as founding engineers.\n\nSeriously, don’t waste your 20s fulfilling someone else’s dream. If it’s your own startup, go for it. But with all this acqui-hire BS, I really don’t recommend it.\n\nIf you want, there are plenty of late-stage, pre-IPO startups that offer better ROI.. both in terms of learning and monetary reward.",

I went through three co-founder breakups, which was tough. The bottom line is that we didn’t have product clarity.\n\nNow I’m back to basics, building frugally, not from scratch, but with a ton of lessons learned from last year. I’m starting this year with much more clarity and a far stronger foundation.",

Why do some people manage to generate massive results while others never do, even when the effort seems to be the same?\n\nI’d like to go deeper into this and understand what perspectives or frameworks exist around this idea.",

You increase your probability of finding your next idea, next round of funding, next customer, etc. It's still not a guarantee, but you can manufacture your luck.\n\nOf course, you can counteract a shitty luck situation by increasing the number of shots you take and improving your understanding of the market.",

His advice was basically be out there, if you are at home binge TV, which is ok, but that will almost certainly not lead a chance coffee with someone. \n\nBecause of his story, I make myself go to startup events and I try to meet new people as much as possible.

I believe founders responsible for tech should understand business, and founders responsible for business should understand tech (might be wrong but that’s what I believe) \n\nI’m in my 3rd year of university with one year left. I’m finishing a business degree (yes, I know useless), so I can’t realistically fully study something related to tech in Uni. So the only other option is to self learn programming / tech.\n\nFor the past few months I’ve been self learning (vibe coding a bit and building very basic python projects). But I always find myself not being consistent and it’s because I don’t have a clear goal on were I want to get to and a structured plan on how to get there. \n\nThis year I want to take it seriously. So I’m curious how you lovely technical people would approach this. \n\nHow would you define a technical person? \n\nAnd how would you approach self-learning how to code from a beginner’s perspective? \n\nAny advice is appreciated ",

I'm sure you've heard the phrase learning by doing, and that's all it is, but you have the miracle of being able to talk to AI and ask why it did it this way, and what this specific line does, and what it's formally called and all that.  \n\nMy specific advice is not to have cursor build the whole thing for you but to talk to ai step by step about what you want to do and have it teach you.  Not, build a slideshow that has images and movies and one of the slides is the current weather, but: hey, chatgpt, how do I put a picture on the screen, what line of code does that.  And then you take it as far as you can from there.  You know you want the slideshow to have 10 photos, look at that line of code, and what do you think you should do to get 9 more?  Copy and paste it 9 times.  Sure, try it out.  You'll notice the images are all vertical instead of in a row next to each other.  Hey chatgpt, how do i put the images next to each other instead.  Every step will result in a new question.  Eventually you'll be like, hey how do i make sure the user is authenticated and the app store can accept payments and by that time you will have learned along the way about code, frameworks, client vs server, security, and it will all come from thinking of the next step and asking how to do it.",

Depending on what it is and the papers you come across, you're probably not going to have as linear a structured learning path, but the upside is that you can really deep dive as far as you want to and formulate a strong opinion in that area. It's like an endless library out there where you can have access to peoples/groups years of work being condensed into learnable techniques and outcomes that you have the opportunity to employ in projects if you really want to experiment and learn from further. I find this helpful for myself as a technical person and while you can just go through the plain udemy/youtube/coursera XYZ tutorials on docker, kubernetes, aws etc which is all fine stuff, I kinda see that as a game of catch up from non-tech --> tech rather than people being generally interested in that stuff most of the time.",

Plenty of great courses on Udemy, Coursera, YouTube, etc. if you want to build the Typescript ecosystem is probably the best place to start. Python is easier but there is a ton of community around TS and you can basically build a whole app in NextJS and single click deploy to Vercel. Shoot me a DM if you have any questions.

While you are checking your click-through rates in line at the supermarket or Starbucks, how many potential customers are standing around you?\n\nI co-founded a marketplace app a while back that serviced businesses and consumers. The only online marketing we did to get going (online ads came at scale) was posting in local Facebook groups. Everything else relied on finding our potential users in person and talking to them. Businesses are easier if they have a storefront because you can just walk in. Consumers require a bit more creativity. Again - we used Facebook groups, we also went to local colleges and job fairs, bars, etc... Get your users one at a time face-to-face... Uber did this to get drivers early on.   \n  \nI also worked on a financial investing app and once posted on Reddit about creating a local investor group in my area to chat about investing. I had a decent response just never followed through due to a business shift - but if I wanted to get 10 investors on my app today I'd be using social media not to \"get signups\" but to get in-person meetings.\n\nA long time ago my wife was into door-to-door vacuum cleaner sales. I hated her business and their sales tactics, but damn did they know their stuff. Get your first 10 users in your backyard.

Open your laptop and place a small sign that says something like “Free coffee for your feedback.” Invite people to try your demo or prototype.\n\nImportant: do not ask questions like “Do you like it?” or “What should I change?”\nInstead, give them a specific task and observe how they try to complete it using your product.\n\nYou only need 5–7 people to start seeing clear patterns. This should not blow your budget.\n\nWatch closely:\n\t•\tWhere do they hesitate?\n\t•\tWhat do they misunderstand?\n\t•\tWhat do they try that doesn’t work?\n\nAfterward, ask reflective questions such as:\n\t•\t“How did that work for you?”\n\t•\t“What made this difficult?”\n\t•\t“What would make this easier?”\n\nAvoid asking for feature ideas. You’re not looking for what to build next.\nYou’re looking for what’s blocking successful use and what would reduce friction.\n\nThe goal is to understand:\n\t•\tWhy they struggle\n\t•\tWhere the product fails to support their intent\n\t•\tWhat currently prevents them from using it successfully\n\nThis is far more valuable than asking whether they like it.",

Set it up in different parts of NYC. See who comes to play. These people are your customer base---people who would be willing to chat with strangers and try out a new activity. Tell them you have an app coming in 3 months and they can sign up for your waitlist. \n\nThe other tactic, if you want to be more B2B (and I think this has the sounder model). Go to activity places--bowling alleys, skate rinks, badminton, etc. Say you're building an app where people get discounts for going to places that aren't busy. \"Matinee for Everywhere\". When there they get paired with the two or three other people that also got the discount. The businesses get more revenue from people coming on off hours, and I think if you spend the day interviewing business owners, compiling a list of 10 that would be interested then you have a real shot at building something people will pay for. \n\nBy day I'm a business consultant for Series A companies and building a \"Duolingo for Founders\" --- happy to chat further!",

The symptoms are many: slow sales cycles, high churn, low win rates, but they all have the same root cause: the startup is working on a problem that is not important enough to the segment of customers they are selling to. Until you fix that, the rest doesn't matter.\n\n\\- But, yes, founders who reach PMF and have a chance to grow their companies will tell you that hiring and keeping great people is their biggest challenge. And it's not just hiring engineers - it's hiring any key position. The most challenging hires at many of my startups were in marketing, design, or sales. All hiring is hard.\n\n\\- In general, hire slow/fire fast is still the right advice. No matter how well you hire, a certain % of your hires will be mistakes (20-40% most likely), so the skill to move those people out is almost as important as bringing people in. It's amazing the mental gymnastics many founders will go through to avoid making these hard people decisions. I've seen founders let their companies fail after years of work and millions of investment because they weren't willing to have a five minute conversation to let someone go.",

Execution is what matters. Almost no successful startup ends up finding a large market opportunity by philosophizing about it first. They ship fast, learn fast, and keep iterating as fast as possible until they find the real opportunity. It barely even matters what the original idea is.\n\nBuilding a company is a mess, and building the product is only a small part of execution. You need to show that you are going to pull a lot of weight in the ways that they don't want to, and enable them to focus on what they are good at and enjoy while you make everything else work.\n\nFor example, you could demonstrate a lot of value in terms of navigating product market fit, like by bringing concrete evidence of demand and the gap, and you could show that you can get distribution and raise money off of it.\n\nI can build anything that can be made with software, and I am good at building and running high performing engineering and product teams, but I hate raising money, doing sales, anything self-promotional, and I am disorganized and find organizing things draining. I have good product sense but am also not a good designer.\n\nSo what I look for in a cofounder is someone who is a really good salesperson, with a good network, who is good at taking mess and turning it into order, who has good taste, and who is interested in the same problem as me for compatible reasons. \n\nBasically, I just want to build the product and solve the problem I find interesting with smart people. And when I look for a cofounder, what I'm looking for is someone who will make it so that I can just do that and we both end up with a great business.\n\nI'll do a ton of things that make me miserable to get a startup to succeed too, but what I'm looking for is a cofounder that lets me minimize that misery, even just because people are less effective when they are miserable.\n\nYou could also start with a lower stakes side project framing, and then demonstrate a lot of value and ability to find traction that way.",

One is a good friend (extremely connected in the Arab world and can help with fundraising), the other is a good client from another business (extremely connected in the influencer world and can help with distribution). \n\nHow do I handle that? Additionally, what is the actual process to formally assign equity etc? Should I look for a fractional CFO? Also is it common to hire people to \"negotiate\" for you? Like I plan to look around for people who have worked similar big deals in the past, and have them negotiate everything.\n\nI've not really told anyone else the product is live. Should I, if it means more valuation? Kinda want to avoid time performing for investors if I can spend it capturing the industry.",

If I recall correctly YC has a form term sheet you can use as a starting point for discussions. You don’t need a CFO to assign equity at this stage unless they are a cofounder that has some skill set important to what you’re building.  \n\nSeed and Series A companies typically are valued on a forward multiple of revenue as you aren’t generating meaningful free cash flows or revenues yet. You should do some homework on valuation methodology and value ranges for your company and that will be a good basis to then seek guidance from a mentor or advisor and allow you to negotiate a deal. \n\nYou should consider having some level of review from a lawyer that has both industry knowledge and expertise in doing early stage deals.

The Mom test covers most I’d this. \n\n- You can tell them your hypothesis/assumptions and ask them to invalidate. I find people love to correct you, so do as much research you can ahead of time to form a specific hypothesis, and they can say if it’s true or not true for them. This can often lead to insights about different segments of customers you weren’t aware of before. ( you can use this a email hook to get their attention, but IRL only do this after they’ve done most of the talking). \n\n- look for other latent signals of pain (eg workarounds, significant time spend, hiding of consultants). People tend to only focus on explicit complaints, but put on your research/journalist hat and look for other signs of pain that they have just normalized to.\n\n- If you have a great conversation with one person ask them to for a another person to talk to ( this is called snowball reciting)\n\n- not always true, but if people aren’t super eager to talk take that as a sign that they aren’t facing a “hair on fire” problem they need desperately solved.",

As many may not understand their problems themselves, misjudge what might be their actual problem, or just focus on the wrong elements when talking about it. \n\nWe are building a software solution used for discussion exercises. For us it therefore was very valuable to not only ask about how they do it today, and try identify their pain points from conversation (which is easiest of course), but instead invite ourselves over to observe how they actually carried a discussion exercise out. It gave us much more context and revealed pain points they hadn't talked about or just ignored. We where then able to ask much more informed and direct questions, as we had observed them and hence had more knowledge about their usage. \n\nAnother point worth mentioning, Id say, is that those who use a product may not highlight the same problems as the ones who make the buying decision. Understanding both groups is crucial: 1. How can you solve the problems of those who will use the product (making their days more convenient/pleasant), and 2. How can you solve problems for those who make the buying decision (saving money and/or time), is important to not oversee. \n\nGood luck!",

The best validation I’ve seen comes from problems you’re already close to, where people will complain without being asked. Vague answers are a signal too, it often means the pain isn’t sharp or they don’t own the problem. On calls, I never pitch an idea. I ask about their workflow, what breaks, what they’ve hacked around, and what they pay for today. If they don’t want to talk for 20 minutes, they probably won’t buy anything later. It’s not just a numbers game, it’s a relevance game. You want fewer conversations with people who feel the pain weekly, not dozens who feel it vaguely once a year.",

If the primary goal is to open source, it’s always gonna be at odds with effectively making money.\n\nFor example, “I have created a highly scalable MySQL engine and have built a cluster + service to host it. But nobody knows about it or trusts it… so to enable adoption I’m gonna open source the project! Voila, you get Clickhouse + Vites”\n\nOn the opposite end, you have Bazel.build which came out of Google as a means to attract developer interest in their build system and use as a peacock feather for hiring. The OG author set up his own consulting firm around the open sourced Bazel. Yeah, you can make some money, but it’s not a great monetization scheme. ",

          "text": "With open source - monetization is still the most important thing. You can't help the community unless you're receiving a steady flow of cash. Presenting a product as open source to an investor is like presenting ping pong tables plans for your office. Both are equally important to receiving investment. In other words - not at all.\n\nHaving said that, essentially every single investor does not understand the word open source. So you should not in any way focus it. The investor wants to know how you're going to make money. This is why it is extremely important to approach the investors with at least some initial revenue. You can almost not mention that you're open source until the very end of the first presentation under \"community building\" initiative of your company.\n\nIf revenue is not an option at this stage, you need to show adoption. Market cornering is usually understood as extremely valuable in on itself. I think one of the best examples is langchain: make an extremely useful project and then offer a cloud service to make it even more useful.\n\nDo not think of your product as open source when talking to an investor. And never let an investor think of your product this way. You product is a product. It has either adoption or revenue already. This will make money for the investor. What you do in your \"free time\" is entirely up to you.",

A lot of offshore companies offer both managed and unmanaged options for contracting. I took the route where I interviewed each developer as if I were hiring them then managed them the same. Still had the lower rates and if an employee didn't work out I went back to my agency (more like a partner) and they found me some replacements to interview.\n\nRecently, I had a project where I wanted some offshore talent and instead of going through the partner again I just went directly to applicants from Costa Rica and paid them via Remote.com. This was much cheaper - but you have to dance around their versions of 1099 vs. w2 and make sure that everything is above board.",

Ask them what piqued their interest. Ask about their business. Ask about their company's key challenges and initiatives.\n\nYour inclination will be to talk about your \\*product\\*, but you should mostly talk about the \\*problem\\* your product solves. Why is it important to them? How are they solving it today? Do they have a budgeting project to solve it? What else are they looking at. You might not even show them your product until closer to the end of the meeting.\n\nYour inclination will be to make the meeting \\*formal\\* but most business meetings are pretty \\*informal.\\* Yes, prepare for the meeting and go in with a list of questions, maybe some slides and a demo, but try to be relaxed, and make it conversational.\n\nYour inclination will be to avoid \\*awkwardness\\* but you may need to seek it out. Know what you are asking for, and save time at the end of the meeting to ask for it. You might ask for a pilot. You might ask to meet some other people on the team. At a minimum you'll ask for a second meeting. But ask for something, and ask for something they might say \"no\" to and something that requires a commitment of time or money or social capital from them. Otherwise it's not an ask.",

While I know there is no equal alternative to meeting people personally and getting to know them & their pain points in a specific domain, leaning to know how they are solving that problem if at all they are solving it!   \n  \nHowever, since I am not a natural storyteller or a great speaker, I ended up with lot of awkward silences and whenever I was there with best of my energies, I realised that many times, people don't say exactly what they mean and often times they also don't know what they actually want. But over time I realised this is part of the process to go through, and I am trying to learn this and genuinely trying to connect with them without selling them anything. \n\nSince I was also serving other clients for their own products, I realised everyone needed a tool that can help them validate their idea / product. And what's even more exciting here is that you can do customer interview meetings and talk to your potential customers easily via AI customer persona. (Sorry to shamelessly plug this here, but this couldn't be more related than what I have gone through before). I still believe there is nothing better than talking to people personally and in real life but the next best things could be [launchcheck.me](http://launchcheck.me) \n\nThis is free to use and not only you can validate your idea in detail but also talk to you AI customer persona (which you will be amazed about as you won't be able to differentiate if its a human or an AI customer). It gives you a blunt truth about your idea and no biased thoughts. While this tool is still in progress but phase 1 is still meaningful and usable. \n\nLet me know if this helps you in some way and if you have any feedback for me.",

Things moving fast. \n\nIt’s clearly a challenge (sleep organization essentially and lack of free time), but nothing impossible. \n\nMy 2 cents : \n\n- make clear with your partner that you’re an early stage entrepreneur (you cannot just “stepback” for a few months in your 9to5 job) \n\n- You need help (partner, family,…) and take as maximum as you can. Budget babysitters if needed you’ll see quickly the payback \n\n- Make also clear to yourself that you need a bit of free time, like sports or whatever. Work + parenting is intense, you need cooloff time for you.",

A month later I was working at another YC startup. It was pretty intense for the first 6 months burning out both at home and at work. Then I joined Meta for a slower pace in life (Meta is supposedly intense… BS). It’s been over a year at Meta and having no regrets except for the boring mundane corporate BS work.\n\nOTOH, one of my friends had a baby 2 years in post seed raise and pmf. He just had his second child and company has a 2B valuation.\n\nBasically, you will have to make a hard decision, but you can’t make it until you know your babies and personal financial needs. Take at least 4 weeks of paternity (even from your own startup) and reassess your situation honestly.",

Having reliable childcare is a must, as is a predicatable schedule b/c you'll need to get what you can get done in the time you're given. One of my closest founder friends who did Techstars with me was also nursing/pumping and it was amazing to have someone in the same stage as me. We'd both get up at 4am to get 2 hours in, get the kids off to school, be back online by 9am, then offline by 4:30pm for dinner/bedtime, then back online at 9pm. As a working parent (and even more as a working mom), you become hyper focused on what's most important, work efficiently and just do your best.",

For every update (based on feedback, progress, insights, whatever), I'd have to edit things in Canva, download as PDF or whatever, and reupload to DocSend. Not a biggie, but not smooth either.\n\nThis year, I'm using a Notion page as a \"deck.\" Instant/one-step edits (though tempting to keep optimizing into oblivion) but no visuals or meaningful insights/tracking.\n\nWhere are we all landing between these approaches (or a third, better way)? Just want to get back to building ASAP, so your thoughts are very much appreciated. \n\nContext: deeptech / infra, compute space, etc.",

At the first two, I was mostly doing database work in NeonDB and PostgreSQL and occasionally doing frontend work in the typical React Typescript stack. The third one, that I currently for fun since it's unpaid, is machine learning work for medtech.\n\nI am really bad at noticing trends or problems in the space. If I had to say anything in particular, I'm seeing that a lot of companies are spending more money than they need to be on AI dev tools because they're spending a ton of time trying to debug poor code built without any design.\n\nHobby and interest wise, I'm really into video games and cybersecurity. I studied cybersec in college and it's something I'm personally passionate about. I'm also interested in anti-scam things. I'm not sure that there is money in that industry but I'm seeing a lot of people I know falling for scams and losing lots of money.",

I'm tired of working for large corporations that can't pivot to emerging technology and continously lose ground to competiton.  I have a solid insurtech startup idea, however I'm an expert in insurance, not technology.  \nShould I try to get initial funding leveraging my business experience and then go after a CTO co founder? Or is that basically impossible?  I have a verifiable track record of creating revenue over my career.    \nHappy to hear any advice.  Thanks.  ",
