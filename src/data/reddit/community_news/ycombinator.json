      "text": "If you want to scale your marketing with influencers but dont want to burn cash on bad deals, get scammed by fake bot views, or waste months listening to \"gurus\" who have never actually booked a sponsorship... then you might enjoy this.\n\nI work as a Marketing Director for a pretty big brand and I also run my own SaaS on the side. \n\nBetween the two, I've hired over a thousand influencers and spent millions in partnership dollars.\n\nHere is the brain dump on what actually works:  \n  \n\\-YouTube longform first until you max out on youtube longform, dont do any other format. Nothing beats the power of the attention spam and the direct CTA with link in description as longform does. Ignore all the gurus telling you to hire one million micro influencers on TikTok, even if you’re target audience is on TikTok/Reels, I guarantee there are also channels on youtube with longform videos for that same audience, dont waste your time don’t lose your sanity, do longform until there’s noone else to partner with on that format.  \n  \nYou need to have a solid proven offer before you try influencers. Have scarcity in the CTA, like “First 1,000 people to click the link get this special offer”  \n  \nTest 60 second integrations vs fully dedicated videos (more expensive). Have them put the 60 second promo in the first 5 minutes of the video to maximize eyeballs on your offer.\n\nBeware of scammers, several channels inflate their views and engagement with bots, look for suspiciously consistent high views across all videos, look for repeated and sometimes identical comments praising the influencer, too many emojis, and celebrities in the profile pictures even.\n\nIf you’re a startup strap for cash, you will want to push for commission only deals, for my startup Rebelgrowth, that’s 30% on every generated subscription for life, but in my experience most influencers don’t like performance deals even when they would be making more money in the long term, they dont know this so its your job to explain the math on why this is the case, make a simple spreadsheet, make a loom video, praise their last video, explain why you think your startup would be a great fit and explain why the commission offer is better than flat rate.  \n  \nHowever, if you’re an established startup/company with a budget, you’ll want to do flat rate deals because YOU will make more money in the long term as opposed to having to pay 30% of your revenue forever.  \n  \n30% of deals will succeed, those are the channels you will want to nurture and repeat and that will carry the whole effort, another reason why you need to stay away from flat rate as a bootstrapped startup, you can’ afford to have your first 10 deals fail looking for the 3 that will work. This is a numbers game.\n\nWhat I look for in a channel (this is less important when doing performance deals): Audience affinity; how relevant is the topic to your business, what are audience demographics (age, location, genre), how consistent are views across the last 12 videos, how often does the channel publish, what’s the engagement rate (high engagement = high conversions), I can afford more on a channel with 7,000 views but 15% engagement rate than a channel with 10,000 views but 5% engagement rate. Engagement is comments to subs (or views) rate.\n\nOn flat rates, always negotiate down aggressively, argue why with the channels using your analysis from the above paragraph. I personally look for sub $50 CPMs when doing flat rate (irrelevant when doing commission deals).  \n  \nTo find channels, ask your favorite AI chat to do “Deep Research” and find the top 100 channels that meet your preferred criteria. If doing commissions, aim for small channels to improve your chances of getting a “yes”, so channels with under 10k subs. You can also simply search youtube, or one of the millions of apps out there that have a youtubers database. Gather the list and then it's time to find the emails. I pay a guy on upwork $50 per 100 researched channels because youtube only lets you unlock 5 emails per day. This guy has a bunch of accounts he uses to unlock emails quicker.  \n  \nOnce you have the emails, use your favorite outreach tool to schedule 4 - 7 emails (the money is in the followups). Keep it simple, lead with “Paid sponsorhip?...” in the subject and first line of email copy so the influencer knows you’re down to business.   \n  \nHave dedicated landing pages per influencer or dedicated coupon codes or if you’re doing affiliate commissions it doesn’t really matter since they will have their affiliate link to your product anyways.   \n  \nYou’ll want to stay compliant if you’re a big company, which means making sure the influencer clearly discloses its a sponsorship when the Ad begins, have them put your logo as soon as they say the video is sponsored by your company.\n\nCheers,  \nBorja\n\np.s. this post was edited to share the unfiltered, non-AI version of my draft, with wrongful grammar, etc.",

But I'd push back on the idea that commission-only is a realistic path for pre-revenue startups... creators have seen too many affiliate programs flame out, so the upfront cash is really insurance against your company not existing in 6 months.\n\nThe hybrid model (small flat fee + rev share) seems to thread the needle. You're signaling you have budget and believe in your product, while still aligning incentives long term. I've seen that land better than pure commission pitches, especially with mid-tier creators who have more options.",

Traffic doesn’t.\n\nOutreach #1 tip:\n\nStop cold pitching strangers with paragraphs.\n\nTarget warm-ish leads and send 2 lines max.\n\nOffer a free resource or insight. No links.\n\nJust start a convo like a human.\n\nAds #1 tip:\n\nIf your tracking is even slightly broken, you are literally donating money to Meta.\n\nRun Pixel + CAPI. Optimize for purchases, not signups, not free trials.\n\nMeta is a machine. Feed it real conversion signals or it guesses.\n\nSocial #1 tip:\n\nHooks are everything.\n\nNobody reads your post.

Don't build anything; go talk to 200 people and try to find at least 20 who confirm the problem exists and are willing to pay to have it solved. You might learn of a different problem they are willing to pay for. Early is a great time to pivot.\n2. Now, pursue a co-founder if you wish. I strongly support a co-founder; I have done both, and I am now all about the team. But keep it small, 1-3 founders no more. Split the equity evenly, but have a good understanding of legal docs in place in case someone wants to leave early (high probability).\n3. Build an MVP, confirm customers love it. Ideally, grow without VC money. But, if you have an MVP and have confirmed customers want it, this is also a good stage to start raising money.\n\nThere are a lot of companies that start on a totally different path, so don't take anyone's post too seriously, but our step 1 (customer discovery) above has helped us so much with fundraising, focusing the direction of our prototype and pilot plants, and our investors love to see all the homework done.",

          "text": "My suggestion wo LM d be to use a chatbopt of high quality to interview you and guide you through the steps to build a defensible product/service. That includes a lot of research and analysis you can do upfront. Combine Gemini 3.0 Pro with NotebookLM to perform deep research to give you the framework to decide what to build. Once you have that concept, evaluate it based on analytical tools such as SWOT, PESTEL, Porter's 5 Forces, VRIO, CLV, competitive analysis, Gap analyses, and optimal market positioning. Now you have a defined concept with strong supporting logic and framework to clarify a detailed PRD. But before you start to code, create a Rubric to critically assess the findings and plan, and provide improvement suggestions. Iterate the vision until you receive a grade >95%.\n\nYour vision should include not only the core product, but also everything you will provide that will give you a competitive stronghold. For example, when Apple launched the iPod, they also announced iTunes to serve as a reason customers would stay with Apple. When they announced the iPhone, they announced the Apple store - a platform innovation that further solidified their product.\n\nThe next step I suggest depends on the concept on how technically proficient you are. In a recent consulting gig I am working on with the founder, I took about 1 to 2 weeks researching how to set up an integrated development environment that would give me all the tools needed to run the company as a solo-preneur. Using AI-powered agents to run operations is relatively easy to set up if yyou know how.\n\nOnce you have the solified vision, the planned architecture, feedback from the agentic panel of judges, AND the toolset to start building, start building as an orchestrator, not a developer. In other words, turn the PRD over to your IDE, and take the \"human in the loop\" role as manager to direct the efforts.\n\nIn my consulting days, we had a saying - \"when planning the perfect bank robbery, you have to rob a few convenience stores.\" In other words, with you power IDE setup, you could seek out opportunities to develop parts of the concept through project work you pick up.\n\nWhen you get the list below set up, you are ready to pitch the concept to an Angel investor. (That's another story.)",

          "text": "MVP are the old gold standard for new product development.\n\nThe time is long past. Now they are THE ABSOLUTE STUPIDEST WORST APPROACH.\n\nAI tools allow competitors to use your MVP as a \"Product Requirements Document\" (PRD) to rapidly reverse-engineer and enhance your product—is a critical reason why the traditional \"launch early and incomplete\" MVP strategy is becoming dangerous.\n\nBased on the sources, here is an analysis of why this \"MVP as PRD\" dynamic is forcing a shift in product strategy:\n\n### 1. Code is a Commodity, Not a Moat\nThe ability for AI tools to \"reverse engineer\" applications highlights a fundamental shift: software execution is no longer the primary barrier to entry.\n*   **Accelerated Cloning:** New AI-driven workflows (using tools like Cursor or Replit) can shrink traditional monthly development cycles into single weeks [1]. If your MVP relies solely on \"we built the code first,\" you are vulnerable because AI has lowered the cost and time of replication to near zero.\n*   **The \"Visible Invention\" Risk:** Intellectual property strategy dictates that if an invention is \"visible in the product\" and easily reverse-engineered, trade secret protection does not apply [2]. By releasing a basic MVP, you are effectively publishing your blueprint to the market before you have established a defensible position.\n\n### 2. The Danger of \"First-Mover\" Education\nIn the traditional model, being a \"First-Mover\" allowed you to learn and iterate. In the AI era, a weak MVP creates a **Fast-Follower Advantage**.\n*   **Free Market Research for Competitors:** If you launch a minimal product to \"test the market,\" you are paying the \"education costs\" to prove the need [3]. A competitor equipped with AI can observe your MVP, identify its friction points (using AI sentiment analysis of your user reviews), and use generative coding to build a superior \"v2\" before you have even fixed your \"v1\" [3, 4].\n*   **The Reality Check Filter:** Competitors can use \"Reality Check Filters\" and \"Competitive Analysis\" AI agents to analyze your MVP's gaps against capital and resources, allowing them to skip your mistakes and launch a more \"viable\" version immediately [5].\n\n### 3. The Shift to \"Synthetic Validation\"\nTo prevent your MVP from serving as a competitor's PRD, the new \"AI-First Product Blueprint\" suggests keeping the product hidden while validating it virtually.\n*   **Validate *Before* You Build:** Instead of building a public MVP to learn, teams should now use **\"Synthetic Validation\"**. This involves using AI agents to run preference tests with synthetic user panels to gather data without exposing the concept to the public market [1].\n*   **Internal Iteration:** You can use AI to simulate the \"build-measure-learn\" loop internally. By using AI to generate user stories and test cases, you can refine the product definition (the \"Living AI-Generated PRD\") privately, ensuring that when you finally do launch, the product is robust enough to withstand cloning attempts [1].\n\n### 4. Building Defensible Moats (Beyond Code)\nSince the application layer is easily cloned, the sources suggest moving value to areas AI cannot easily replicate in hours:\n*   **Ecosystems and Data:** The transition from \"Product to Platform\" creates high switching costs. A competitor can clone your interface, but they cannot easily clone a \"data continuity\" model or a complex ecosystem of connected services and wearables [6].\n*   **Deep Integration:** \"Software-defined products\" often rely on the integration of hardware and software (e.g., a car or medical device). While the code is clonable, the physical architecture and the integration of that code into a hardware platform are much harder to reverse engineer quickly [7, 8].\n*   **Brand and \"Must-Haves\":** A clone might have the features, but it lacks the brand trust. Ensuring your product hits \"Must-Be\" needs (table stakes) *and* \"Delighters\" (which create emotional connection) creates a loyalty barrier that simple feature-cloning cannot break [5, 9].\n\n### Summary\nThe fact that AI can turn your MVP into a PRD for a clone means **stealth is now more valuable than speed.** The modern approach is to front-load the \"homework\" using AI for deep research and synthetic testing [1, 10], essentially \"de-fuzzing\" the concept privately. When you do enter the market, you must arrive with a product that is fully featured and protected by an ecosystem or data moat, rather than a minimal implementation that is easily copied.",

Same pitch. Nothing closed.\n\nI was wondering if the problem was:\n\n* the product\n* the pricing\n* or just me being bad at demos\n\nSo I stopped.\n\n\\--> I was too close and too involved with what I was building, I could not see what's wrong with it (or with me). \n\nI cancelled my booked demos.\n\nSpent \\~3 months in Japan and the Philippines.\n\nDidn’t touch the product. Travelled, got drunk many times, reset.\n\nComing back:\n\n* I cleaned up the UI\n* simplified the workflows\n* stripped down A LOT of extra features\n* made the product super lean\n* rewrote the messaging\n\n\\----> Watched a lot of YouTube videos on how to run demos and close enterprise deals\n\nAfter new year, I shipped a new version and turned demos back on.\n\nTwo weeks later I demoed to the CEO of a publicly listed company.\n\nThey liked it.\n\nI gave a price.\n\nThey countered.\n\nI said yes.\n\n**$7,000. First real enterprise sale.**\n\nNot life-changing money — but after months of zero conversions, it feels massive.\n\nIf you’re stuck sometimes the answer isn’t “push harder”. \n\nIt’s “step away, get perspective, then come back sharper.”\n\nHappy to answer anything.",

The Horizontal vs. Vertical Paradox**  \nOpenAI and Anthropic are fighting a war for horizontal dominance. They need to build a model that works \"pretty well\" for 1 billion people.\n\nIf they stop to build a deep, perfect workflow for just Tax Accountants or just Supply Chain Managers, they lose the wider war. That is our gap.\n\n**2. The 'Liability Shield' (The Real Moat)**  \nThis is the strongest defense for startups like us. OpenAI provides intelligence, but they cannot provide liability.\n\nIf ChatGPT gives bad legal advice, OpenAI says \"Check our TOS, it's an AI.\"  \nIf a vertical SaaS gives bad legal advice, they lose the client.\n\nThe next wave of startups isn't just selling text generation; we are selling the verification and safety rails that allow enterprises to actually use that text. OpenAI avoids this layer because it carries too much regulatory risk for a general platform.\n\n**3. Data Gravity**  \nIf you are just a UI wrapper, you are dead.\n\nBut if you build a layer above and make OpenAI a utility (like AWS), you change the framing and narrative. OpenAI is a tool supporting you, not a competitor.\n\nDifferent talents and market opportunities compete differently. The game isn't to beat OpenAI at being \"smart\"; the game is to segment the market and own the niche where specific context matters more than general intelligence.",

Especially in something as personal as dating, people default to polite feedback instead of honest feedback because admitting confusion, embarrassment, or “this didn’t help me” feels vulnerable to everyone. Face-to-face works because trust is already established; software removes that emotional safety net.\n\nThe gap here is likely not product quality but how feedback is being asked. Direct questions invite soft answers. Behavior doesn’t. Watch where users drop off, what they skip, and what they never come back to, that’s the truth. Before raising for distribution, I’d try reframing onboarding to force small commitments or outcomes early, so feedback shows up in actions rather than words.",

I think you’re onto something, and just elaborate on my thinking here is that having an AI coach, In fact l, takes off that level of embarrassment most guys feel approaching a human for advice with women. However women seem to have no issue with that and in fact, I have much easier time on boarding women than men despite the fact of men are the ones who need to make the first move and that there is a vast amount of training and development men can do to improve their chances with women. Could you collaborate on how would you say to the address that last part i.e. onboard users and track when they are leaving at the moment? I’ve  got meta ads running from today what should I be looking for?",

With ads running, you can optimize for those behaviors rather than signups alone, if people don’t hit that early moment of relief or clarity, they’ll leave quietly no matter how good the product is.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nNew to this subreddit but I am looking for all the advice I can get. About 20 years ago, I had an idea for a social media website (sorry don’t want to give too much info away) while I was college and tried to learn as much web development as I could (design and database) and after awhile I just gave up as I had no connections to anyone in the development world and just gave up. Fast forward to today, with the help of Claude and Codex and about 6 months of time, I have the site just about fully working beyond just a proof of concept (beyond just an mvp I think). I know people always feel confident about their ideas and whatnot, but I feel this site has potential to make money from day one and the more people use it, the more money it could generate. I’m about as new to the startup world as you can get and looking for any advice I can to see how I can either find funding from investors, to perhaps try to keep going and get this idea off the ground myself? As I'm the only one navigating this path, I have so many questions but I’m finding it tough to find a course that will educate me to even ask the questions I need if that makes sense. Again my apologies for the lack of details as far as the site goes, but I'm just trying not to get burned. thank you in advance. I'm located in Boston if that help :-)",

If it can make money from day 1, why not get to day 1 as fast as possible?\n\nIf it’s easy enough to copy that someone can “steal” it with just the idea before you launch, it is definitely easy enough for them to copy it after you launch. Especially since they’ll have development talent that you don’t.\n\nAnd if you’re not a developer, and using just Claude or lovable or something to code, the site is definitely not secure or stable enough to scale with actual users and their personal data. \n\nThat is not an investable picture. Either launch and prove traction, particularly prove that it can make money from day 1, or move on.\n\nThis all might come across as harsh, but it’s meant to encourage you to avoid over investing, so you can free yourself up to be successful. I really love entrepreneurial energy and dedication, but it always bothers me to see people get so in love with a particular idea that they waste months or years on building in private, instead of testing ideas actively until one genuinely solves a problem and resonates with actual customers.",

I have let me friends try, the problem with friends are they are usually going to be bias no matter if you say \"give me your honest opinion\". if I were to go by their feedback alone, Im sitting on the next instagram which i know is probably not correct.  the problem I'm currently encountering is that middle growth. beyond friends, but don't think its quite ready for a public beta. this is why I'm asking the questions from my original post. and yeah, Im currently a little gunshy at showing the site off as of now. I've yet to find a site that executes the idea the same way as the site and for the time being am holding it a little close to the chest.",

It's gonna basically be shouting into the void and developing marketing chops, a personal brand or something that enables you or your site to gain any traction.\n\nYou're in a tough spot. Not saying give up, but you need a technical dev to execute beyond what AI can do. AI basically breaks after 5k lines of code.  So then you need to segment the architecture to scale features beyond what you have.\n\nProblem is, it'll be hard to find a technical co-founder that wants to bet on your business skills.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the only way out is a lot of insane hours to become skilled at everything from marketing, sales, HR, seo, dev, etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc.  Then executing on everything.  See Alex Hormozi's story.\n\nBut to start, you need to come up with targets you're trying to hit, whether it's dev goals, usage goals, finding funding, finding partnership, figuring out the next thing to learn.\n\nThis is basically the lonely and tough grind portion you're entering.  You have something, now you want to sell it (to users, investors, employees, partners) So go on and start selling or figure out how to sell your vision.",

Less than 1% and you're basically being hired as an employee with startup risk and no startup upside.

When you reach out to an ICP, you're not asking them to buy - you're asking if the problem you think exists actually exists for them. That framing makes the conversation way more natural because you're genuinely curious instead of pitching. Also, most people in SV are used to getting cold outreach. The ones who respond are self-selecting into your target audience. It's a numbers game but the numbers are smaller than you think - 10 real conversations with ICPs will teach you more than 6 months of building in isolation.",

      "text": "I Reviewed Many pitch decks .\n\nHere’s the no-BS pitch deck playbook most founders get wrong.\n\nIf you’re raising capital and your deck isn’t landing…\nIf investors say “interesting” but never follow up…\nOr if you’re copying templates from Google and hoping for the best…\n\nThis might save you months.\n\n\nWe run a fractional CFO agency. Between our clients and my own deals, I’ve sat on both sides of the table — pitching investors and evaluating decks for funds.\n\nHere’s a straight brain dump on what actually works.\n\n1. Your deck is not a presentation. It’s a decision document.\nMost founders design decks like TED talks. Big mistake.\nInvestors skim. Fast. Your deck should make sense without you talking. If someone forwards it internally and it doesn’t hold up on its own, you’re done.\n\n2. The problem slide matters more than your product\nNobody invests because your product is “cool.”\nThey invest because the problem is painful, urgent, and expensive.\nIf your problem slide doesn’t make an investor slightly uncomfortable, it’s too weak.\n\n3. Your solution should feel obvious (in hindsight)\nIf you need 5 slides to explain what you do, that’s a red flag.\nGreat decks make investors think:\n“Why didn’t this exist already?”\n\n4. Traction beats storytelling. Every time.\nYou can have the prettiest narrative in the world — traction still wins.\nRevenue, growth rate, retention, pipeline, pilots.\nEven early signals beat vague vision.\n\nNo traction yet?\nShow momentum, not excuses.\n\n5. Your financials are silently killing deals\nThis is where most decks fall apart.\nUnrealistic hockey sticks.\nNo understanding of cash burn.\nNo link between growth and spend.\n\nInvestors don’t expect perfection — they expect financial literacy.\n\n6. Your “Ask” slide should be painfully clear\nHow much are you raising?\nWhat does it unlock?\nHow long does it last?\n\nIf an investor has to guess any of that, they usually just pass.\n\n7. Less slides. More clarity.\nMost winning decks are 10–14 slides.\nNot 25.\nNot 40.\n\nIf everything feels “important,” nothing is.\n\n8. Design won’t save bad logic\nClean design helps.\nBut no amount of visuals will fix a broken story or weak numbers.\n\nStrategy first. Slides second.\n\n9. Every deck should be built for its stage\nPre-seed decks shouldn’t look like Series B decks.\nYet founders copy whatever raised last on Twitter.\n\nContext matters. Stage matters. Investor mindset matters.\n\n10. The best decks don’t try to convince — they invite\nYour goal isn’t to “sell.”\nIt’s to make the investor want the next conversation.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nThis is exactly how we think about pitch decks inside our fractional CFO practice — combining strategy, numbers, and investor psychology, We create investor ready pitch deck for startups not just slides.\n",

YC partners have seen a thousand dashboards. they haven't seen someone get goosebumps from a demo. your metric isn't clicks - it's the number of orgs that came back after the first session and asked for more. retention in creative tools IS the product-market fit signal.",
