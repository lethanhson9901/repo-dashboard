Almost every strong engineer I see now wants to build a startup, and many of them already have great skills, networks, and access to capital.\n\nAs someone without elite technical skills or a strong startup network, it makes me wonder if this is still a smart path—or if the odds are now heavily skewed toward people who are already well-positioned.\n\nIs it still realistic to pursue tech startups today if you’re not coming from FAANG, YC, or VC circles?  \nIf yes, where do people actually compete without getting crushed?\n\nWould love to hear honest takes, especially from people who’ve tried this.",

Some are just prototypes, but it's like they've tasted blood.. they now know what's possible with a bit more iteration and dev support. \n\nThis makes GTM trickier for startups. But I think startups can still move faster and think broader. Instead of point solutions, think vertical integration...maybe own the workflow end-to-end, not just one node. Or go horizontal, be quick to take that same capability across industries before incumbents connect the dots.",

Sure, AI takes away a lot of coding and other bottlenecks, but it also means new problems emerge and you don't need to wait for several rounds of approval before you can work on a project, if you're working with startups. \n\nAlso, now is the best time for non-tech folks to actually use their domain knowledge more than ever. I am a tech founder myself, I work with a client who worked in supply chain, and they're running a startup and I am amazed by their clarity in the product direction, primarily coming from domain expertise, and then combining it with continuously chatting his ideas into ChatGPT and Claude. His customers in non-tech loves the product,  and the entire thing was shipped in the span of one month.\n\n  \nThese are exciting times, and I have a strong feeling more fun is yet to come.",

They  see through the noise. They get crystal clear on what is really moving the needle (it's always 1 of 3 things). And they dig in, throw  the dice, kick down the door, and do it. \n\nDon't try and build the next big thing. Solve the big problem (there's lots of them).

Then you’ll have traction to make real connections that will then lead to bigger doors opening and more ideas. Networking is my secret weapon, whenever I feel stuck.

Honestly, at a certain point, the 'founder' title starts to feel like a crowded room where everyone is pitching but fewer people are actually building for the long haul.\n\nI’m actually considering leaning back into being a high-level **AI Engineer** for this exact reason. If everyone is busy 'running a startup,' there is going to be a massive premium on the people who can:\n\n* **Fix the 'Scalability Wall':** Most of these startups look great with 100 users, but they crumble when they hit 10k because the code was rushed or built on shaky prompts.\n* **Bridge the Compliance Gap:** In 2026, you can't just 'move fast and break things' with data. Startups will be desperate for engineers who actually understand AI ethics, ADA compliance, and data security—not just how to call an API.\n* **Verify the 'AI Magic':** There is a lot of 'AI theater' out there. The real winners will need people who can verify that the models are actually performing and not just hallucinating expensive errors.\n\nSometimes the smartest way to 'compete' in a gold rush isn't to dig for gold, but to be the one who knows how to fix the drills when they break. There's a massive underserved market in being the person who makes the '50 identical products' actually work at an enterprise level.",

Part of me thinks this is a classic trap where I subsidize someone's usage forever while chasing a contract that never materializes.\n\nMy gut says: if they saw real value, they'd find the money.

It's all verbage in business. \n\n  \nContact some other universities and put together a small demo or trial for it. That will actually give you a good idea of the market. We took HSMN, our architecture, and split it off into computational chemistry sim and ran into the same issues. Everyone in that market wants to use it for free effectively, and always with the promise of being paid. There's even a whole platform dedicated to those types of contracts, and it always reminds me of the Tesla and Edison with the promise of $50k to Tesla if he completed a project, of which he was never paid. Those contracts all feel eerily similar to that, they attempt to put your work beneath what they're doing in order to control it. \n\n  \nIf you're self funding, just build the features out yourself.

      "text": "\\*None of the equity is vested yet, in 1 year cliff.\n\nI’m looking for some outside perspectives because I feel like I’m stuck in a situation with no clear way forward.\n\nMy technical cofounder and I started building a few months ago, we raised our first round quickly and our user base is growing fast. Then he suddenly got sick last December. At the time, I was fully understanding and supportive. Health comes first. We slowed things down and I took all the operational work.\n\nNow it’s late January 2026.\n\nIn the past 2 months, he’s told me multiple times that he can work, that he’ll finish things “today”, this week” or “soon,” but in practice he keeps disappearing and got nothing done. I messaged him many times to understand what’s going on and what I should be expecting, but he just ignored all those messages. There’s no response, explanation, no progress, no clear timeline, and no real handoff of the tech stack or decision-making authority.\n\nMore recently, he disappeared for over a week and I was worried. Yesterday he finally texted me back and told me that he went back to his home country for treatment. Plus he said that the stress is what caused his health issues and blamed me for not having any empathy. I feel really bad and I’m being left in a position where I can’t move the company forward at all.\n\nWe do have investors. The company still exists. Bills, responsibilities, and expectations still exist.\n\nI sent him a formal email laying out decision-making, accountability, and asking for clarity on whether and when he plans to return and be actively involved. He didn’t respond to the substance of it and instead said he can’t check his email right now.\n\nThat’s the part that really worries me: it feels like I’m being held indefinitely. Not a no, not a yes, just…nothing concrete.\n\nI’m willing to keep operating the company if there’s clarity and a workable structure. I’m not trying to screw him over or take advantage of his illness. But I also can’t just pause my life, career, and responsibilities forever while someone else holds more equity and is intermittently unavailable.\n\nOne additional detail that complicates this: neither of our founder equity has vested yet (we are in the 1-year cliff). Given the lack of participation and clarity, I’m trying to decide whether it’s appropriate to formally issue notice around vesting and continued service, or whether that would be premature or unnecessarily aggressive in a situation involving health issues.\n\nSo at what point does “being understanding” turn into being stuck? If you were in my position, would you issue formal notice regarding vesting, or wait longer?\n\nI’m trying to sanity-check whether this situation is as unworkable as it feels, or if there’s something I’m missing.\n\nWould really appreciate hearing how others have handled similar founder situations.",

If this goes legal later you’ll need it.\n\nThe blaming you for his health issues is a red flag btw. Thats not how healthy cofounder relationships work. You were supportive, slowed things down, took on extra work. Don’t let guilt cloud your judgement here.\n\nHard truth: you might need to find a new technical cofounder or hire a senior dev to take over. The company cant stay frozen forever.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

          "text": "I’m sorry you’re in this — and I’ll be blunt: the biggest issue here isn’t even the illness, it’s the lack of clear communication and accountability.\n\nIf someone is genuinely sick, that’s real. But going dark for weeks, repeatedly promising “today/this week,” ignoring your attempts to clarify expectations, and then flipping it into “you have no empathy” when you ask for basics… that’s not a workable partnership dynamic. Whatever the cause (health, burnout, avoidance, conflict), you can’t run a company in limbo.\n\nA few things stand out:\n\n* **You have investors and a living company.** Bills, obligations, and momentum don’t pause because a cofounder disappears.\n* **Neither of you has vested yet (1-year cliff).** That’s not a technicality — it’s literally designed for situations where the founding team doesn’t end up functioning.\n* **You’ve already tried the empathetic route.** You slowed down, carried ops, reached out repeatedly, and asked for clarity. You didn’t jump straight to legal threats.\n\nAt this point, I’d stop treating this as “how long do I wait?” and start treating it as **“how do I get the company out of hostage mode?”**\n\nIf it were me, I’d do two things in parallel:\n\n1. **Get a real decision deadline on the table.** Not “when you feel better,” but something like: *Are you able to actively contribute X hours/week and be reachable within 24–48h? If not, we need to restructure immediately (leave of absence / reduced role / separation).* This isn’t cruel — it’s operational reality.\n2. **Bring investors into the loop now (measured, not dramatic).** Not as a threat, but as transparency: *“Here’s what’s happening, here’s what I’ve tried, here’s the risk to the business, here are the options.”* Don’t frame it as “he’s a bad person.” Frame it as **the business can’t be blocked indefinitely**. Most investors would rather help you solve it than watch the company drift into a slow failure with money trapped inside.\n\nRe: **formal notice / vesting** — I think it’s reasonable. The cliff exists for a reason. You’re not “screwing him over” by acknowledging that continued service and participation matter. Illness can explain reduced capacity, but it doesn’t justify holding the company hostage with zero clarity.\n\nPossible outcomes you can propose (so it doesn’t feel like an attack):\n\n* Medical leave + temporary transfer of decision-making + clear check-in cadence\n* Role change (advisor) + equity adjustment\n* Separation (unvested equity returns to the company) + you recruit a new technical cofounder/CTO\n\nYou’re allowed to be compassionate **and** set boundaries. Empathy isn’t “I accept indefinite ambiguity while the company dies.”\n\nOne practical note: talk to a startup lawyer before sending anything that sounds like legal notice. But yes — from the outside, this situation already reads unworkable unless he can immediately re-engage with clear commitments.\n\nIf you want to talk it through, feel free to DM — I’ve been in a similar seat before and I’m happy to sanity-check next steps. And seriously: take care of your health too.",

You said find one angel investor and get incubated, so you mean a strategic investor who'll back us up always in our initial days even if small cheques while we complete our incubtion right? This might sound silly but should we really risk revealing our idea, plan, and pitch deck to an angel who will get to see the problem statement and solution that we want to develop. How do we mitigate this, we will learn about IP and idea protection, pitch deck preparation and tips on what not to reveal only during our incubation. \n\nAlso, do you recommend joining an incubator is better than a VC accelerator program that are meant for idea stage startups (Example Accel -Atom , Peak XV -Surge, 100X VC - HomeRun Masterclass Series), because  incubator may take only 3-5% equity but it's followed by Angel or VC pre-seed round of 9-15% equity, so total between 12-20% equity for 1Cr-10Cr. \n\nWe may save 3-5% equity, by directly heading to an accelerator insted of incubator. \n\nWill appreciate your response and opinion.",

          "text": "Obsession is mostly a retrospective story we tell after something works. It sounds clean and heroic, but it confuses cause with consequence. What actually builds ambitious companies is not obsession. It is clarity plus incentives plus feedback that compound over time. Obsession often shows up later as a visible symptom, not as the engine.\n\nIn the early stages, what looks like obsession is usually asymmetric information. Founders know something others don’t yet. That creates conviction. Conviction creates focus. From the outside, that focus gets labeled obsession. But the underlying driver is not emotional intensity. It is informational advantage combined with belief that the advantage can be converted into outcomes.\n\nObsession without execution quality is useless. Many obsessed founders ship nothing meaningful. They romanticise the problem, over-identify with the idea, and become blind to signals. Obsession actually becomes dangerous when it overrides feedback loops. You stop listening. You start defending. You confuse persistence with progress. That is how companies burn years on the wrong thing.\n\nWhat matters far more is the structure around the founder. Tight feedback loops. Clear metrics. Skin in the game that rewards long-term value, not short-term validation. The ability to revise beliefs without losing identity. None of these require obsession. They require discipline.\n\nThe best ambitious companies are not built by founders who are constantly emotionally charged. They are built by founders who can sustain focus for a long time without burning out, who can make boring decisions repeatedly, and who can delay gratification while staying rational. That looks unsexy. So we call it obsession instead.\n\nObsession is overrated because it is easy to mythologise and hard to replicate. Execution quality is boring but transferable. Incentive design is boring but powerful. Feedback loops are boring but decisive. These are the real multipliers.\n\nIn practice, obsession helps at the margins. It can push someone through temporary uncertainty or social resistance. But it is not the core driver. The core driver is sustained alignment between belief, evidence, and reward.",

You need this obsession when building an ambitious company because there will be a million things that challenge you along the way, and the people that don’t have that would give up. \n\nThe financial struggles, giving up conventional paths, arguing with family, having to explain your decision to everyone, all of the people who tell you to just get a real job, the people who don’t get your idea, the people who tell you to “just bring it to your competitor”, the people who say it’ll take too much time and money. Without obsession, all of those will crush you. \n\nDoing the company is the only thing. The only choice. Thats the obsession. \n\nIt’s not consistency, motivation, determination, discipline, being type A.

If you have none of those, but have obsession, you’ll never give up.\n\nEdit: @zachpogrob on Instagram discusses obsession regularly and how crucial it was in building his business.

I think there's a lot of baggage with that word.\n\nBut here's what I know: being disciplined and productive when all your employment concerns are taken care of, and when your task/mandate has been handed down by a manager or management in general.. is different than having that focus and determination for something you've conjured up yourself. Being accountable to yourself, and not letting things like procrastination, doubt, fatigue, and even minor bouts of emotional ill-equilibrium derail you... requires that *extra thing*.\n\nThat *extra thing* manifests for each person as a subset (or, maybe, a superset) of their own personality and mental/emotional capabilities. For some it's obsession, for others it's a profound lack of limiting beliefs, at least operationally. For others it's all of the above problems but strong resiliency anyway.\n\nThere isn't a single universal *thing*. It's the best of your individual potential. You can't be someone else, but you can be the optimal you. Figure that out and nurture it and act from it. Seeing the truth of your efforts, and what keeps you from doing something every day, is also a superpower. Lots of people tell stories of their efforts... but they faff about a lot and count their consternation about it as part of their labor investment.\n\nFaff about when you faff about, but work when you work.",

          "text": "I think most people are generally too reductionist about this idea\n\n\nLike if you look at Uber, what made Uber valuable?\n\n\nThey had a fairly unique idea, sure.\n\n\nBut they also actually did the shitload of engineering and algorithmic testing to make it work. They actually figured out pricing strategies, refund strategies, driver comp, incentives. They actually went through all the effort of finding drivers and figuring out the right HR system to manage them. They actually had to work on safety for all involved. They actually fought legal battles against miffed taxi companies and cautious states. Etc.\n\n\nThere were millions of hours of work and detail that were put into making it work and if they hadn't gotten it largely right, perhaps Uber just dies off as a fad or gets swept by some competitor that becomes the billion dollar company in its place (think early search companies vs Google).\n\n\nLike no matter whether you have a unique idea meeting a gap or you just think you can execute better, there is still going to be such an enormous amount of execution and ordinary business operations required that it's not entirely clear how much the idea mattered in proportion. It can certainly buy some attention and early clients and breathing room, okay, but maybe the exact same team would've killed it just as well running a conventional oil & gas exploration firm, you know? \n\n\nAnd on top of that, the good idea is so often a *function* of the other stuff. If you go out and talk to users and build a few products and then figure out what you should actually be doing and pivot, well, you kind of already *had* the good company in place. You just found a better product for that company to make. So did you need the good idea, or did you make the good idea by virtue of having a company that was already good for other reasons, and just early in its lifecycle? \n\n\nTrying to reduce it to \"which is more important, X or Y or Z?\" style questions is often just not very useful. If the billion dollar companies have all these things, they're all important, so go get all of them. The discussion is mostly about what the most efficient order of operations to get them in is and which feedback loops come online fastest IMO ",

They entered crowded markets and saw something others missed.\n\nA few patterns that actually show up in YC-scale outcomes:\n\n1. Non-obvious wedge in a known market Stripe didn’t invent payments. They realized developers were the buyer and made integration radically simpler. Same market, different entry point.\n2. Timing + execution beats novelty Airbnb wasn’t the first marketplace for stays. Smartphones, payments, and trust systems finally made it work at scale.\n3. Unique problem framing, not unique product The best startups reframe who the product is for or what job it really does. That reframing drives distribution and adoption.\n4. Competitive markets are often a good sign Competition means money and demand exist. The risk is not competition it’s entering without a sharp reason you’ll win.\n\nWhat doesn’t work:\n\nSlightly better products with no clear wedge\n\nCopying features without changing distribution, buyer, or economics\n\nBelieving praise from LLMs instead of real users (your instinct there is correct)\n\nA useful test isn’t is this idea unique?  \nIt’s: Why will this work now, and why us?\n\nIf you can answer that clearly, uniqueness usually follows as a result not a prerequisite.\n\nIf you can’t, novelty won’t save it.",

Potential market size estimates are reasonable, but still just speculations that don't consider how hard execution actually is regardless.\n\nThe prime example for this is AirBnB.\n\nBefore them, nobody thought that a system for sharing your home with strangers is viable or unique enough to create a 100 billion dollar firm, as other companies doing that already existed and remained limited and niche. \n\nBut they were pretty wrong.\n\nBrian Chesky and his co-founders suffered through immense execution in the early years while refining the concept, listening to a select few super interested users until AirBnB was able to take off, because they finally found a way to make rentals feel like visiting a best friend.\n\nMost people don't get this, but a \"startup\" is really just a vehicle to generate a  \"real\" startup idea. Whatever you start with is just a hypothesis, and the only way to prove the hypothesis is real is to see it emerge as a collective need from your portion of users in the market. So it'd be an idea you can actually feel because you listened and appealed to your users so well (product-market fit), and that you can also execute on, because your history and current skills qualify you for it (founder-market fit). Until then, you'd keep refining or pivot.\n\nLastly, startup success follow a power law: over 90% fail for various reasons, but those that succeed often become massive. If you study successful founders, you'll see crazy combinations of immense skill, determination, timing and ultimately just luck from their environment which made success possible.\n\nSo instead of worrying about idea uniqueness, just execute on your hypotheses while learning how to listen to and serve users, in exchange for money.",

But with Claude and the current wave of AI tools, it feels like the barrier to building SaaS products has dropped dramatically. A lot of things that used to justify standalone tools can now be built in weeks.\n\nBecause of that, we decided to expand our market and focus on a segment that seems harder to clone with AI: payments, with a very specific value proposition and real operational complexity.\n\nCurious how other founders here think about building defensible B2B SaaS today.  \nWhat kinds of moats still make sense in your experience?",

That's the massive opportunity that's well underway. Added some more thoughts here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1qil3jo/mindset_shift_for_b2b_founders_deliver_the_work/",

          "text": "Haha, this is insane. My product has been live for months, and I still haven't implemented pricing, despite people pushing for it. The problem with our model is that it is completely new; we can't just do what others are doing. Everything came to me last night, validating that delaying pricing was the right call.\n\n**1) Understand what exactly the problem you are solving for them is, and your pricing should quantify it.** If you are just a \"middleman,\" usage-based fees make sense. But if you are \"infrastructure,\" a subscription for the platform + credits for the AI labor is the move.\n\n**2) Don't tax success.** The biggest \"gotcha\" with usage-based billing is that it eventually feels like a penalty. If your customer grows, their bill explodes, and they start looking for ways to bypass your platform. You want a model where they are happy to grow because the \"core\" cost stays predictable.\n\n**3) Monetize the complexity, not the volume.** Instead of charging per user or per \"action,\" charge for the organization of it all. People will pay you to solve their \"mess.\" When the UI gets cluttered because they are doing so much work, that’s your signal to upsell them on a higher-tier organizational structure.\n\n**4) Credits should be \"Agentic Fuel.\"** We went with pre-paid credits because it shifts the mindset from \"I’m paying for a feature\" to \"I’m buying units of labor.\" Pre-paid avoids the \"bill shock\" of usage-based models. It's much easier for a company to approve a $50 credit top-up than to see a surprise $500 bill at the end of the month.\n\nWe literally followed the cursors model, but without the seat-based model because it does not provide any value, and it benefits us if they have many team members cause this will exhaust their credit and will either have to top up or upgrade their plan.",
