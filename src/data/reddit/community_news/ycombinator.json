I’ve spent months building something technically complex and stressful to execute, and we’re now near launch.\n\nHere’s the honest problem: I understand marketing conceptually, but I don’t execute distribution well. I’m not good on camera. I stutter. I don’t naturally push myself into visibility.\n\nI can build systems. I can ship. I can handle product depth. Growth and narrative are not my strengths.\n\nIf anyone here has taken this path successfully, I’d appreciate your insight — and I’m open to conversations.",

They are supportive and willing to have a meaningful conversation. There is a lot of support we can get if we just ask. \nAnd that brings me to the second point\n\n2. Be part of community: there are a lot of people in the same phase. You are not alone, and as you need support they need it too. Do not connect with them with an idea of selling or receiving something, rather have a giving mindset. Contribute to a conversation, with no hidden agenda. \n\n3. Relationships over transactions: it takes aprox 3 connect moments for a person to remember you. Build relationships, sales will happen eventually. \n\nDont wanna sound to preachy, but i know its tough as an introvert to go and connect. Something you can try is go to an event this week, even if you go and not meet anyone, its still better than not going :)",

You'll slowly get better at speaking in front of others and putting yourself and your product out there.\n\nNext steps:  \n1. Start making videos, maybe even a youtube channel for practice  \n2. Start a social media account on X or LinkedIn and regularly post and comment. \n\n  \nYou got this!",

Writing instead of talking. Content compounds. One good post reaches more people than 50 coffees. And you can do it at 2am in your pyjamas.\n\n2. Communities over events. Find the Discord servers, Slack groups, and subreddits where your buyers hang out. Be helpful. Answer questions. No pitch, just value. Eventually people ask what you do.\n\n3. Partnerships over cold outreach. Find someone who already has your audience and figure out how to help them. Cold outreach is still important, but being helpful and building goodwill is very powerful.\n\n\n\nDistribution is a solvable problem for introverts. You just need to find the channels that fit how you actually work.",

Maybe that person can handle the distribution better than you?\n\nAlso, being introvert shouldn't be the end of the world. Ideally, you have contacts you already know, people you're not afraid to speak to. Maybe some of them can gove you feedback, test your product or even pre-order or buy it? I mean, it doesn't need to be a public marketing campaign. It can start by a few you already know. As long as your product is good (does the job, no matter how it looks like), they will start doing the best marketing job for you, for free: word of mouth.\n\nHowever, there's something you need to deal with, and I'm there myself too: to sell you need to be able to create tension. At some point you need to say something that puts other people in a position where they need to make a decision. It might feel uncomfortable but unless they're already 100% convinced, you'll have to give them a push.\n\nI'm learning this myseld at the moment.\nSo, let's get our entrepreneurial job done, let's sell and get paid!",

Surprising part: the more we wrestled with the questions, the more clearly we understood the product, the users, and ourselves. We trimmed jargon, tightened the problem, and built tiny proofs instead of big promises. A few lessons we’re taking with us:\n\n* YC questions are a mirror. If an answer is fuzzy, the product is probably fuzzy.\n* “Why now?” forced us to look beyond hype and pinpoint a real shift.\n* User conversations beat deck polishing every time.\n* Cutting scope isn’t defeat; it’s speed.\n* Numbers calm nerves. Rough unit economics exposed weak assumptions.\n* Write -> sleep -> rewrite. Clarity compounds.\n\nWe also came away more honest about risk: what must be true, what could kill us, and what we’ll do next week to reduce uncertainty. Regardless of the outcome, the process itself created momentum and better habits: shorter cycles, crisper metrics, and less ego in the roadmap.\n\nTo everyone applying this batch: you've got this. Good luck, back to the grind.",

      "text": "If you want to scale your marketing with influencers but dont want to burn cash on bad deals, get scammed by fake bot views, or waste months listening to \"gurus\" who have never actually booked a sponsorship... then you might enjoy this.\n\nI work as a Marketing Director for a pretty big brand and I also run my own SaaS on the side. \n\nBetween the two, I've hired over a thousand influencers and spent millions in partnership dollars.\n\nHere is the brain dump on what actually works:  \n  \n\\-YouTube longform first until you max out on youtube longform, dont do any other format. Nothing beats the power of the attention spam and the direct CTA with link in description as longform does. Ignore all the gurus telling you to hire one million micro influencers on TikTok, even if you’re target audience is on TikTok/Reels, I guarantee there are also channels on youtube with longform videos for that same audience, dont waste your time don’t lose your sanity, do longform until there’s noone else to partner with on that format.  \n  \nYou need to have a solid proven offer before you try influencers. Have scarcity in the CTA, like “First 1,000 people to click the link get this special offer”  \n  \nTest 60 second integrations vs fully dedicated videos (more expensive). Have them put the 60 second promo in the first 5 minutes of the video to maximize eyeballs on your offer.\n\nBeware of scammers, several channels inflate their views and engagement with bots, look for suspiciously consistent high views across all videos, look for repeated and sometimes identical comments praising the influencer, too many emojis, and celebrities in the profile pictures even.\n\nIf you’re a startup strap for cash, you will want to push for commission only deals, for my startup Rebelgrowth, that’s 30% on every generated subscription for life, but in my experience most influencers don’t like performance deals even when they would be making more money in the long term, they dont know this so its your job to explain the math on why this is the case, make a simple spreadsheet, make a loom video, praise their last video, explain why you think your startup would be a great fit and explain why the commission offer is better than flat rate.  \n  \nHowever, if you’re an established startup/company with a budget, you’ll want to do flat rate deals because YOU will make more money in the long term as opposed to having to pay 30% of your revenue forever.  \n  \n30% of deals will succeed, those are the channels you will want to nurture and repeat and that will carry the whole effort, another reason why you need to stay away from flat rate as a bootstrapped startup, you can’ afford to have your first 10 deals fail looking for the 3 that will work. This is a numbers game.\n\nWhat I look for in a channel (this is less important when doing performance deals): Audience affinity; how relevant is the topic to your business, what are audience demographics (age, location, genre), how consistent are views across the last 12 videos, how often does the channel publish, what’s the engagement rate (high engagement = high conversions), I can afford more on a channel with 7,000 views but 15% engagement rate than a channel with 10,000 views but 5% engagement rate. Engagement is comments to subs (or views) rate.\n\nOn flat rates, always negotiate down aggressively, argue why with the channels using your analysis from the above paragraph. I personally look for sub $50 CPMs when doing flat rate (irrelevant when doing commission deals).  \n  \nTo find channels, ask your favorite AI chat to do “Deep Research” and find the top 100 channels that meet your preferred criteria. If doing commissions, aim for small channels to improve your chances of getting a “yes”, so channels with under 10k subs. You can also simply search youtube, or one of the millions of apps out there that have a youtubers database. Gather the list and then it's time to find the emails. I pay a guy on upwork $50 per 100 researched channels because youtube only lets you unlock 5 emails per day. This guy has a bunch of accounts he uses to unlock emails quicker.  \n  \nOnce you have the emails, use your favorite outreach tool to schedule 4 - 7 emails (the money is in the followups). Keep it simple, lead with “Paid sponsorhip?...” in the subject and first line of email copy so the influencer knows you’re down to business.   \n  \nHave dedicated landing pages per influencer or dedicated coupon codes or if you’re doing affiliate commissions it doesn’t really matter since they will have their affiliate link to your product anyways.   \n  \nYou’ll want to stay compliant if you’re a big company, which means making sure the influencer clearly discloses its a sponsorship when the Ad begins, have them put your logo as soon as they say the video is sponsored by your company.\n\nCheers,  \nBorja\n\np.s. this post was edited to share the unfiltered, non-AI version of my draft, with wrongful grammar, etc.",

But I'd push back on the idea that commission-only is a realistic path for pre-revenue startups... creators have seen too many affiliate programs flame out, so the upfront cash is really insurance against your company not existing in 6 months.\n\nThe hybrid model (small flat fee + rev share) seems to thread the needle. You're signaling you have budget and believe in your product, while still aligning incentives long term. I've seen that land better than pure commission pitches, especially with mid-tier creators who have more options.",

But that's not what you're saying.\n\nI think the problem I foresee here is: when there's a leadership meeting, who can speak credibly to the tech side of the business to the other leaders? who is advocating for the technical organization?\n\nWithout that, the **absolute best case scenario** is that decision making is slowed because every meeting they have to leave the meeting to gather input from the tech side. And as we all know, startups thrive on slow decision making.\n\nThe more *likely* scenario is that...well, the tech side of the organization gets hosed. They will made decisions without any technical expertise providing input, those decisions will suck, and then there will be no one to explain to them why their decisions suck. Then they will throw you guys under the bus, first just in their own heads, but then eventually in reality when they act on what's *in* their heads'.\n\nIf the company is a tech company, you need someone who knows tech in those leadership meetings -- and not just present, but someone with the clout to go toe-to-toe with the rest of the leadership. So they have to be at least on somewhat equal footing with the founders in influence somehow.\n\nAt the very least, ask them these questions, and see what they have to say. I suspect they're going weasel a bit and say \"well, we know a thing or two about what we're trying to build, Q founder will be responsible for you in addition to X, Y, Z responsibilities.\". And then I would be unpersuaded and would run. Whatever they say needs to be DAMN convincing to persuade me to stay.",

          "text": "This will get downvoted because technical people are horribly insecure and social morons, but thats fine.\n\nI work in VC, have founded a company, and over time, I have been amazed at 2 things:\n\n1) most non-technical founders/ idea guys are not actually non-technical founders they are posers. I really hate the phrase “non-technical founder” for this reason because there is a radical difference between some mba who is going to run “business” or “marketing” and someone who doesn’t code, but has a very unique insight to a specific market and can raise capital. There are a ton of people who can say they “have an idea” HOWEVER, a good non-technical founder is way way way more important than a technical hire and it isn’t close. There is a reason zuck and Elon aren’t coding or in the cto role. The #1 reason startups fail isn’t “shipping speed” it’s they build something people don’t actually want or solve a problem that isn’t actually acute enough, or they mismanage cash. YC optimizes for someone technical because otherwise you aren’t going to be able to build something. But don’t get it twisted—knowing what to build is actually the hard part and that’s so overwhelmingly obvious to anyone that has invested. The whole point of a seed round is to find product market fit.\n\n2) technical people are some of the most arrogant antisocial, naive people I have ever met. They could win an award for most wasted talent due to being a social moron. I say this due to watching sometimes brilliant people overplay their hand, set hard rules, not understand fundraising/capital markets and just be so flipping arrogant about their value as “builders”. A great example of this is thinking all equity grants can be compared across companies. Thinking 2% for a founding engineer role for a SaaS company with customers and a previously existed CEO should be compared to a 5% grant at an AI company with a 24 year old ceo is the sort of dumb math technical people do. Ultimately, it tends to be more about their egos and insecurity than rational business decisions. I would avoid this if I were you.\n\nNow, for this situation, it seems like the non-technical person is legit with a prior huge exit, market validation, and they can fundraise. This massively derisks the venture and they are way further along than would justify you being a cofounder.\n\nYou need to make a calculated bet on 2 things:\n1) how big could the company be?\n2) how much do they respect technical people or have quasi understanding?\n\nIf the equity offer is very low, that says something. Likewise, I’d just ask what their plans are for a CTO and how your role could grow and change. You should also be able to ask questions about the vision, your role, and what they find important in their product to reveal technical attitude. \n\nIt is possible for someone to be a subject matter expert and brilliant manager who doesn’t code, but is able to learn and heed the advice of technical people around them. It’s only a red flag if the non-technical people show a complete lack of competence or interest in understanding technical limitations and don’t value technical product constraints at all.\n\nSo, in other words, there are no rules, with startups everything is highly specific to the company. Don’t be the classic technical moron trope, but make sure the non-technical people are more like Sam A, zuck or Elon with a decent understanding and aptitude to talk with you about technical challenges otherwise you will have a bad time.",

They need to build a model that works \"pretty well\" for 1 billion people.\n\nIf they stop to build a deep, perfect workflow for just Tax Accountants or just Supply Chain Managers, they lose the wider war. That is our gap.\n\n**2. The 'Liability Shield' (The Real Moat)**  \nThis is the strongest defense for startups like us. OpenAI provides intelligence, but they cannot provide liability.\n\nIf ChatGPT gives bad legal advice, OpenAI says \"Check our TOS, it's an AI.\"  \nIf a vertical SaaS gives bad legal advice, they lose the client.\n\nThe next wave of startups isn't just selling text generation; we are selling the verification and safety rails that allow enterprises to actually use that text. OpenAI avoids this layer because it carries too much regulatory risk for a general platform.\n\n**3. Data Gravity**  \nIf you are just a UI wrapper, you are dead.\n\nBut if you build a layer above and make OpenAI a utility (like AWS), you change the framing and narrative. OpenAI is a tool supporting you, not a competitor.\n\nDifferent talents and market opportunities compete differently.

But if you're solving a very specific problem for a very specific audience with proprietary data or deep domain expertise, OpenAI isn't as threatening.

But the truth is, the counterparty might just be ranting. Not every conversation requires a solution; sometimes it just requires understanding.\n\n1. Startup Sales NOT EQUAL MNC Sales\nBuilding a startup is very different from doing sales at a giant like Microsoft. At Microsoft, you are capturing existing demand. In a startup, the value proposition requires intense scrutiny.\n\nJust because we think it is useful doesn't mean it’s true. But likewise, just because the market says \"we don't need this\" doesn't mean you stop.\n\n- I remember when Internet Banking in the 90s was viewed with disgust by bank CEOs.\n\n- I remember when Java was viewed with deep skepticism by the CTOs of that era.\n\nYou have to see the \"shift in the sand\" before the market does. The early stage isn't about selling to everyone; it's about finding the specific beachhead that allows you to prove the innovation works.\n\n2. Process over Personality\nSales isn't just about being an extrovert. It's a process.\n\n- What objections did I handle well?\n\n- Did I segment the prospect correctly?\n\n- Is the value prop aligned?\n\nThis is an ongoing loop. We actually just build an internal \"AI co-pilot\" just to ensure we stay aligned and consistent when we go to market. It keeps us honest to the process.\n\n3. The \"Trusted Expert\"\nThere are different sales personalities. You have the \"Openers\" (great at cracking doors open), but you also have the \"Trusted Experts\" (technical authority).\nThis is why VCs often prefer teams over solo founders. You can tag-team: one relationship builder, one technical expert.\n\nIf you are a technical founder, don't try to be the \"loud salesperson.\" Be the expert who builds the future. It is part of the business building and personal growth journey.\n\nHope this helps. All the best.",

Why does talking to users make you “better” at sales? \n\nMy take is that it makes you see your Fix and solution from their eyes and mental state. What kind of problem severity led them down the search until they went with your solution? What converted them from interested into buying customers? What was their expectation/reality fit? How much of what you promised was real and helpful to them? If you have a recurring business structure, what made them stay? Is your customer base happy looking else to compare something similar or are they buy and stay with it customers? \n\nAnd once you get those questions answered, it will help you to define your USP better, which you will then use to create an even better picture (arguments) for prospects, to make their decision easier. Emphasis on the easier. \n\n",

      "text": "Several months ago (when we were in the earliest stages of the “idea maze”), we launched a landing page test. Many well-recommended books (e.g., The Lean Startup) recommended running landing page tests as an efficient way to validate if potential users/customers were interested in the solution you have to offer. \n\n\n\nThe idea is to (1) build a landing page describing the problem you aim to solve and how your solution will address it, (2) drive traffic to your landing page, and (3) consider your idea validated if enough people engage with your landing page (e.g., sign up, attempt to pay, etc.).\n\n\n\nFor us, this didn’t work. \n\n\n\nFirst, (1) was non-trivial. We used Framer for the landing page, but (since I’m not a web designer), it took some time to become familiar with all the bells and whistles of their app (in fact, I still don't fully know the difference between ‘stacks’, ‘frames’, ‘containers’....). \n\n\n\nSecond (and more importantly), (2) IS NOT EASY. We ran ads on X, and generated a bunch of traffic. The issue though was that nearly all of that traffic (>98%?) seemed to be from bots. Of course, it’s hard to say for sure if they were bots or just people who came, saw our message and weren’t interested, but given that the vast majority stayed on the page for significantly less than 1 sec (which is incredibly hard / unlikely for an actual person), it’s safe to say they were likely bots. \n\n\n\nUltimately, we stopped the landing page test and chose to focus on talking to more (actual) people. This was incredibly valuable, helped shape our MVP, and actually got us to our first few customers.\n\n\n\nIt’s obviously no surprise that talking to users works. But I would’ve thought landing page tests would’ve been a bit more insightful (though, again, maybe it’s just us).",

Getting people to try AI tools is almost trivially easy right now. Keeping them past session three is where most founders hit the wall.\n\nBuilding fast is a superpower, but it can also mask the real signal. If you're shipping a new product every few weeks, you're optimizing for launch velocity instead of sitting with one product long enough to watch how people actually use it (or stop using it). The contacts-of-contacts deal you landed is telling... that's someone with a real problem who found you through trust, not distribution.\n\nI'd pick the one product where users came back without you nudging them and go deep on that. Talk to the 5 people still using it weekly. The pattern in their workflow is your distribution strategy.",

          "text": "Been in a very similar spot when I started. Went to school for data science/ML. Entered the marketing/distribution side by force around 5 years ago now. Some tips I find helpful NOW that I learned the hard way:\n\n**1. Pick ONE product and go all in on distribution**\n\nSeems straight forward, but it's a lot easier to ship multiple things when you can spend money to delegate.. otherwise you're spreading yourself thin. \n\nMultiple products means multiple audiences, multiple messaging strategies, multiple funnels.. all competing for your limited time and energy. This doesn't have to be a long process either. You can get something growing in a couple months if you're super intentional.\n\n**2. Get in the room where decisions happen**\n\nYou're in Dubai.. so already a good start. But even if you don't go to in person stuff then start connecting with more people online. Value-trading circles, low cost paid communities, programs, etc.\n\nThat's actually a massive advantage right now. The AI ecosystem there is growing fast and there's real money flowing into enterprise solutions. But you can't access it without connecting with the right people quickly.\n\n**3. Build distribution into the product itself**\n\nThe best AI products right now aren't just tools, they're things people talk about and share because using them makes the user look smart or saves them something obvious. \n\nThink about what would make someone send your tool to a colleague unprompted. If you can't answer that clearly, the product might work fine but it has no built-in growth loop. A good place for inspiration is always the B2C world (like simple viral apps).\n\n**4. Content is the biggest advantage right now (and has been for a few years)**\n\nYou can build production-ready AI in under a week. Most people can't. \n\nYou can share the process. You can share the products. You can share tutorials. You can share literally anything. If the products solve real problems, then consistency should reward you within a few weeks (even if it's a very small reward). \n\n**Bonus: Validate before you build the next one**\n\nThis is the big one. And I say it with love because I've made this exact mistake multiple times.\n\nBefore you write a single line of code on the next idea, get 5 people to tell you they'd pay for it. Not \"that's cool\" or \"yeah I'd probably use that.\" Actual commitment. A waitlist signup, a pre-order, a deposit, something with friction. OR if you're not comfortable doing that yet, leverage direct outreach on LinkedIn or email and at least start having the meetings and conversations during the process.\n\nThe direct outreach paired with a decent amount of content would easily get you in front of a few thousand people meaningfully a week.. once it builds momentum it could rise from there. It's also a lot easier to run and scale ads once you validate angles with organic so that's another perk.",

      "text": "I Reviewed Many pitch decks .\n\nHere’s the no-BS pitch deck playbook most founders get wrong.\n\nIf you’re raising capital and your deck isn’t landing…\nIf investors say “interesting” but never follow up…\nOr if you’re copying templates from Google and hoping for the best…\n\nThis might save you months.\n\n\nWe run a fractional CFO agency. Between our clients and my own deals, I’ve sat on both sides of the table — pitching investors and evaluating decks for funds.\n\nHere’s a straight brain dump on what actually works.\n\n1. Your deck is not a presentation. It’s a decision document.\nMost founders design decks like TED talks. Big mistake.\nInvestors skim. Fast. Your deck should make sense without you talking. If someone forwards it internally and it doesn’t hold up on its own, you’re done.\n\n2. The problem slide matters more than your product\nNobody invests because your product is “cool.”\nThey invest because the problem is painful, urgent, and expensive.\nIf your problem slide doesn’t make an investor slightly uncomfortable, it’s too weak.\n\n3. Your solution should feel obvious (in hindsight)\nIf you need 5 slides to explain what you do, that’s a red flag.\nGreat decks make investors think:\n“Why didn’t this exist already?”\n\n4. Traction beats storytelling. Every time.\nYou can have the prettiest narrative in the world — traction still wins.\nRevenue, growth rate, retention, pipeline, pilots.\nEven early signals beat vague vision.\n\nNo traction yet?\nShow momentum, not excuses.\n\n5. Your financials are silently killing deals\nThis is where most decks fall apart.\nUnrealistic hockey sticks.\nNo understanding of cash burn.\nNo link between growth and spend.\n\nInvestors don’t expect perfection — they expect financial literacy.\n\n6. Your “Ask” slide should be painfully clear\nHow much are you raising?\nWhat does it unlock?\nHow long does it last?\n\nIf an investor has to guess any of that, they usually just pass.\n\n7. Less slides. More clarity.\nMost winning decks are 10–14 slides.\nNot 25.\nNot 40.\n\nIf everything feels “important,” nothing is.\n\n8. Design won’t save bad logic\nClean design helps.\nBut no amount of visuals will fix a broken story or weak numbers.\n\nStrategy first. Slides second.\n\n9. Every deck should be built for its stage\nPre-seed decks shouldn’t look like Series B decks.\nYet founders copy whatever raised last on Twitter.\n\nContext matters. Stage matters. Investor mindset matters.\n\n10. The best decks don’t try to convince — they invite\nYour goal isn’t to “sell.”\nIt’s to make the investor want the next conversation.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nThis is exactly how we think about pitch decks inside our fractional CFO practice — combining strategy, numbers, and investor psychology, We create investor ready pitch deck for startups not just slides.\n",

When I showed up at the gym, the activation code didn't work. I wrote an email to their support, but it took them days to reply. I couldn't use the gym, and neither could others. I told them over email that their system sucked. I mentioned I'm a software engineer and if they needed help, they could just reach out and I would help them hook things up.\n\nOne week later, one of the co-founders replied that they might need help. Another week passed and they started asking questions. After about 10 emails, I built them an MVP for a recurring payment processor with PayU (the only payment processor they were able to get a contract from in the region). That fixed their initial problem, but it took us 6 months to integrate with the door-locking company, which was from Sweden.\n\nThe initial product was full of bugs; it was an insane amount of work doing it alone (this was pre-AI). One day, I woke up to hundreds of emails from the gym's customers complaining because the system had double-charged everyone. It didn't have proper reporting, and the founders chased me for months to build it. They used my system regardless of it having the clunkiest UI ever, lacking basic features, so it still required an insane amount of manual work for them, but it worked and allowed their business to grow. It was better than anything else they could get at the time.\n\nThe system I built processed over $500,000 and allowed them to open multiple locations in the city and expand to other countries. \n\nAlternatives costed about $70-90/mo, but they lacked the specific integrations they needed, so I was able to charge $250-$500/mo (they payed quarterly though).
