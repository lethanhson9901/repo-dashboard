Instead think about integrations. Make your app plug into workflows people already depend on so ripping it out becomes painful. That's a structural moat not a feature gimmick.\n\nThe arms race never ends regardless though. Accept that and just stay ahead.

Reddit comments (not posts)\n2. Answering questions in relevant threads\n3. Showing product in context (not “hey try my tool”)\n4. A small free usage model\n\nI avoided:\n\n* Cold DMs\n* Paid ads\n* “Check my startup” posts\n* Spammy links\n\nMost users came from conversations where video creation was the real problem being discussed.\n\n# What surprised me\n\n# 1.) Free users don’t convert just because they signed up\n\nMost users just try once and disappear.\n\nLesson:  \nSignups ≠ validation.\n\n# 2.) Pricing matters more than features\n\nMy pricing was messy in the beginning.\n\nWhen you’re small, simplicity > flexibility.\n\nToo many options confuses people.\n\n# 3.) Payment friction kills small revenue\n\nWhen someone is paying $1–$5, payment fees and failures matter a lot.\n\nMicro-payments are brutal.\n\n# 4.) 2 paying users felt bigger than 266 signups\n\nBecause that means:\n\nSomeone saw value.  \nSomeone trusted enough to enter card details.  \nSomeone actually needed the product.\n\nThat changes mindset completely.\n\n# Biggest learning\n\nGetting users is easier than getting paid users.\n\nPeople will try tools.  \nVery few will pay.\n\nThe real game starts after first revenue.\n\n# What I’m experimenting next\n\n* Simpler pricing (maybe one plan only)\n* Limited free usage instead of generous credits\n* Talking directly to paid users to understand why they converted\n* Improving positioning (less “cool tech”, more “clear outcome”)\n\nIf you’ve gone from 0 → first paying customers recently,  \nwhat changed for you?\n\nWould love to learn from others building in this stage.",

      "text": "Hi guys I wanted to ask for help on career advice that maybe some of you can relate to.\n\nI am a couple years out of undergrad where I studied computer engineering, and interned at big tech and startup in the West Coast. Right after college I joined my family business (manufacturing and wholesale of CPG), and I’ve done decently well. At this point I am done following my family’s footsteps and I am interested in pursuing working in the tech industry again, esp with all of the exciting AI Startups now (would be a dream to get into YC and start a software startup of my own).\n\nI have been experimenting with vibe coding tools like cursor and Claude, and I have been making some prototypes for a B2B saas idea. I understand that for it to truly be a legit software startup, I am nowhere close to that.\n\nI was thinking that I should get a job within a tech startup/corporate first in order to learn the ropes so that I would have the right experience to start my own thing. I have a few classmates from college in YC but I personally don’t feel I have the chops they’re hiring for, since they’re hiring ppl from big tech. It’s been several years so I’ve incredibly rusty in my technical skills, and I have high doubts about my employability since ive only worked in B2B sales and distribution in the physical product space, and idk how transferable any of my skills are from my family business. I know that currently the tech industry is not doing well in terms of hiring people.\n\nShould I go to grad school and get enough technical skills for me to start my own startup, or am I just fantasizing about the AI boom at the moment and I should just be realistic and stick with my family business that is already doing well? I am just so fascinated by all the advancements of AI that I would honestly love to be part of this societal growth and I do not have much interest in my family industry at all.\n\nAny feedback or advice is absolutely appreciated. I understand this sort of post is a bit different from the other posts and I will accept the hate but this is a genuine struggle that I have been dealing with for months. Thank you so much",

All this can be done in a week or days for any idea. 2 years of procrastination, that's what it is.\n\nFor 2 years you raised $0 towards your product. For 2 years you took 0 steps to actually build the product. Now you're worried about founder equity split lol what a joke.",
