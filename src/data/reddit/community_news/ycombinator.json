That did not happen.\n\nWe built a solid product, shipped fast, and then hit the wall you are describing. Attention was easy. Relevance was not. Cold emails worked sometimes. Paid ads brought traffic but not real users. Nothing felt repeatable.\n\nThe first channel that moved the needle for us was talking to founders where they already complain about support, chat, and lead drop offs. Reddit threads, indie hacker type communities, and a few founder Slack groups. I did not pitch. I helped debug their funnel or onboarding and only mentioned {{Name}} when it was genuinely relevant.\n\nIt took around 6 to 8 weeks before this felt predictable. The lesson for me was that distribution is less about channels and more about language. Once we matched how users describe their pain, even cold outreach started working better.\n\nEDIT:-\n\n{{Name}} = Widgetkraft",

Instead of “campaigns,” I did 15–20 1:1 rescues: “I’ll fix X this week if you let me watch and ask questions.” Those became testimonials, case studies, and very narrow landing pages that finally made paid and outbound work. Tools like SparkToro, F5bot, and later Pulse for Reddit helped me systematically find those complaint threads instead of guessing.

It varies based on factors like business requirement and the desired call to action. The important thing however is to find your relevant audience, so many times products go to general audience in the hope of wider acceptance, but at the early stage it is a relevant audience, the early adopters that one should strive reaching out. I work with SaaS founders and enterprise firms to help them create video content with my studio WhatAStory and I realise that mot times reverse engineering content from your distribution strategy is the trick. The other way round of going with the flow is a trail and error process that is time intensive. ",

That’s not terrible for cold traffic, but it means either the pain isn’t sharp enough or the buyer isn’t urgent. Early on, revenue is less about scale and more about density. Ten users who desperately need it are better than 500 curious ones. The hardest hill isn’t monetization, it’s getting in front of people who are actively bleeding from the problem. Once that clicks, signups feel less random and more predictable. Keep building, but spend equal time talking to the 49 who didn’t pay. That’s usually where the real leverage is.",

      "text": "I think I’m looking for other frank perspectives. I feel stupid and lost about what to do with one non-technical co-founder. My fault.\n\n**Background**\n\nYour typical excited college friends who lived together in the same house for 4+ years and wanted to “build the future.” We didn’t know anything, so we started building after “validating” by filling out a startup book’s boxes. (Ik..we're naive.) We’ve been at it about 2 years. We’re bad at distribution, but we’ve built a good product with a handful of paying users after multiple pivots. (yep..delusional, but we strongly believe.)\n\n**Good characteristics**\n\n* Extremely trustworthy, honest, kind, owns mistakes, tries to be fair\n* Quit her job for this and took a part-time job\n* Can really hustle when it makes sense. Amazing to work besides\n* Tries to fill skill gaps\n* Fairly smart and likes to be fast (beginning stage)\n\n**Warning signs to me**\n\n* Prefers planning over doing\n* Goes on vacation that take weeks\n* Avoids trying if she thinks it might fail and gives up after a few attempts\n* Works in bursts: strong start then silence\n* Assumes data and users instead of doing the work to get them\n* Stopped working for 7 months due to lost faith\n* Very slow on tasks over time and had to do them myself\n* Talks more than executes. Expects others to do the work\n* Repeats questions that I’ve already answered\n* Poor communication. Rather go quiet unless messaged (others have called her out on this multiple times)\n* Doesn’t want to leave now because she sees the potential (Share is 1 year vested after 1 year cliff)\n* Talks about raising but doesn’t take action\n\n**In her defense**\n\n* Been going on for almost 2 years with no success\n* Every action to grow in the past year has been met with failure and no major wins\n* Contributed $2k+ as well for api costs and marketing\n* Personal expenses adding up\n\n**My thought**\n\nDespite the warnings, I trust her deeply. I see her potential from living with her and past hustle experiences. I know co-founder betrayal stories are common so I'm thinking that I'm very lucky. \n\nBut I’ve heard “If the company is not making money, you’re worth nothing” So is it fair for me to judge her value when I’m also not driving revenue? My current hat after the tech is marketing which I've failed at for about a year straight. But, I kept experimenting to know what works now. We're close, just need to do more at scale.\n\n**Issue**\n\nI spoke with her directly and she appreciated my call out, admitted fault, agreed to a plan, and asked me to hold her accountable. I want to call for a vote if she reverts back again, but I feel uncertain. My other two co-founders like her a lot as a person and really wanted to avoid the topic when I asked them about kicking her out. \n\nAnyone here with a similar situation? Did you do a final hail mary and discuss it in the general chat? Or did the co-founder end up pulling through, making your patience worth it?",

What are they supposed to do that you think they are not doing?\n\nI'm a firm believer that someone's personality is WAY more important their skills in co-foundership. Skill can be learned by people rarely change who they are.\n\nWhen I started out reading, my first though was \"Keep them if you like them. It's so hard to find good people who are willing to take huge risk with you\" however, as I kept reading I realized you probably did not need this person when you were starting the company. It may be a very common case of \"being in the room\" They were probably in the room when you were discussing the idea with the other founders and you guys were kind enough to include her in the business. This happens a lot in my experience and a common mistake imo.\n\nIf you have the funds I would negotiate a fair \"severance\" with some limited equity (not more than few percent to not mess up the cap table) and talked them into leaving. There is a much larger chance of succeeding without the deadweight of dysfunctional founder. I think you could convince her that it's better to have a smaller portion of possibly something than bigger portion of nothing. \n\nI wouldn't dwell on the \"2 year\" part. These things take time. Pretty much all overnight success stories are result of multiple years of crickets (best example is Cursor. They built AI CAD tools, an email copilot and a AI chemistry tool before building the AI IDE) \n\nWhatever you do, it would take a long, civilized, and a very hard conversation with the whole team but the good part is that it will probably be a good practice for the much harder conversations you will have later on in the company if you succeed :D\n\nGood luck!",

One partner is responsible for the core technical architecture.\n\n3. The other two were brought on to assist with various tasks.\n\nInitially, we wanted to be fair, so we all called ourselves co-founders and gave everyone that title. However, we eventually realized that only the technical lead and I were actually putting in the work and treating this as a career. The other two still prioritize schoolwork.\n\nThey don't dedicate much time to the project and often disappear for a week or two during midterms or finals—usually right when we're facing our most critical and severe bugs.\n\nWhile this issue hasn't been fully resolved yet, we are currently working on it. I feel we need to find an opportunity to sit down and discuss a formal Founder Agreement to define exactly how much time and effort everyone should be contributing.\n\nWe are currently discussing a potential exit for those who can't meet the required work and time commitments. Although we haven't reached a final conclusion yet, I feel like we're finally on the right track.",

They happen from silent resentment that stews from months/years of not having the tough convos. Things like \"goes quiet unless messaged\". Hundreds of paper cuts of emotional debt that goes unpaid until cracks in the relationship start to show.\n\nAgree with you that you should put a vote if it happens again.

Those are very different traits.\n\nFrom what you wrote, she sounds like a good person and a safe partner. That matters a lot. But startups do not fail because people are dishonest. They fail because not enough hard, uncomfortable work gets done consistently.\n\nThe pattern you described is the real signal. Prefers planning over doing. Avoids things that might fail. Works in bursts. Goes quiet. That is not a character flaw. It is a risk tolerance and stamina mismatch. Early stage is basically years of rejection and ambiguity. Some people just do not metabolize that well.\n\nYou also said something important. You are not driving revenue either. That makes this less about “is she good enough” and more about “is this team composition actually capable of breaking through.” If distribution has been the bottleneck for a year, the conversation should be about outcomes, not personality.\n\nThe cleanest way I have seen this handled is moving from vibes to explicit metrics. Define 2 or 3 non negotiable ownership areas with measurable outputs. Not “work harder.” Something like X qualified conversations per week, Y experiments shipped per month, Z distribution channels tested. Agree on a 6 to 8 week window. Review objectively.\n\nIf she pulls through, great. If not, you are not “kicking her out because you feel weird.” You are making a decision based on agreed performance criteria. That also makes it easier for the other co founders to engage in the discussion.\n\nOne more thing. Loyalty is valuable, but misaligned equity is expensive. If someone has already stopped working for 7 months once, you have to factor that into future risk.\n\nThe real question is not “is she trustworthy?” It is “would I choose this exact team again today, knowing what I know?”",

If the answer is “not as things are now,” then you need to redesign the working relationship, not just “try harder” together.\nI’d make the metric plan even more concrete and asymmetric. Since distribution is the bottleneck, give her a clearly owned lane like: prospecting, partnership outreach, or user interviews. Set weekly targets, define what “done” looks like, and agree upfront what happens if targets are missed for, say, 4 out of 6 weeks (e.g., step down to advisor, reduced equity, or part-time contractor).\nAlso put your own metrics on the table so this doesn’t feel like a trial of just her. If both of you can’t hit the bar on growth work, that’s a signal you might need to bring in someone who lives and breathes sales/marketing, and rebalance roles and equity around that reality.\nYour main job now is to replace vibes with a simple, written performance contract that either works or makes the next step obvious.",

One-day tasks became weeks. For example, if I hit 40 DM's a day for two weeks, she’d send about 40 total. She’d also spend weeks on AI mockups that were clearly low quality.\n\nThe conversations shifted from “Did you do this yet? It took me X days” to “You do this in X hours consistently, so why is it taking Y weeks?” It's always been kept respectful with the focus of moving forward “Ok, this isn’t working, let’s try something else.” But the same patterns kept repeating for every task and became frustrating.\n\nEventually she lost motivation and mentally quit while the rest of us tried to learn through volume. She seemed to want quick wins with minimal effort, without doing the research or work to close the gap. Best we could do is give her very simple tasks like create 1 short a day or send DM's...but she kept putting them off.\n\nBUT it could all change after we talked! I’m still hopeful for her because I’ve seen her best self despite what I want. At the same time, I have two co-founders who have worked nonstop and sacrificed far more. I’ve already set a deadline with them for when we’ll call the vote IF she reverts back.",

No one will reveal that kind of vulnerable information without feeling the safety to do so.\n\nThis is the opportunity to be their friend first and say no matter if you need them to do X for the company, “if you need Y and want Y you should do that.”  \n\nThen you can express the needs of the other part, the organization and what you think it needs. \n\n“That’s me talking as a friend. Now talking on the co-founder side…”\nThen say what you think the company needs and your worries about that. \n\nHow do you feel about that?\n\nAnd then you continue the repeating pattern of understanding each others feelings, fears and needs, explaining what you need from them, then re-expressing based on that. \n\nIt’s not really as much of a formula as it is about being honest, direct, and curious. Once your understand each other and you’ve removed the assumptions (like, “she can’t do x cause she has ADHD” or “she won’t do x because she doesn’t care”) then you can actually understand what’s happening and respond appropriately.\n\nBut in the end no formula or strategy will work better than safely and curiously giving space for the person to express what they need.",

          "text": "1. Build something before you ask anyone to build with you\n\nThe founders I've seen successfully recruit early teams almost always had \\*something\\* tangible first. A prototype. A waitlist. A letter of intent from a potential customer. Even a detailed Figma mockup. \n\nYou're not just selling a vision — you're demonstrating that you're the kind of person who executes. That's what attracts serious co-founders. Nobody wants to bet their career on someone who's still in \"idea mode.\"\n\n2. Stop looking for co-founders. Start looking for believers.\n\nThe best early teams form organically from people who are already \\*in the problem\\*. \n\nAsk yourself: Who's already frustrated by this market gap? Who's been complaining about this problem in forums, Slack groups, LinkedIn posts? Those people don't need to be convinced the problem is real — they're living it. That shared conviction is worth more than any equity split negotiation.\n\n3. The salary conversation is actually a filter, not a problem\n\nWhen a potential co-founder leads with \"I need salary from day one,\" that's information. It doesn't make them a bad person — it just tells you where they are in their life right now. They might have a mortgage, kids, aging parents. Totally valid.\n\nBut here's the thing: if someone genuinely believes in what you're building, the conversation shifts from \"what's my salary?\" to \"how do we make this work?\" \n\nThe founders who built legendary companies together figured out creative solutions — consulting arrangements, part-time commitments while keeping their job, deferred compensation structures, or one person staying employed while the other goes full-time. \n\nIf someone can't get creative with you on structure, they probably won't get creative with you when the startup hits its first wall. And it will hit a wall.\n\n4. Reduce the ask dramatically\n\nDon't ask someone to quit their job and co-found a company with you. That's a massive ask with almost no proof of concept.\n\nInstead, ask for a weekend. Ask them to help you build the MVP over 30 days while keeping their job. Ask for a small commitment with a clear end date and a clear milestone. \n\n\"Help me get to 100 users and then let's have the real conversation\" is a much easier yes than \"leave your stable income for my idea.\"\n\nA lot of the best co-founder relationships I've seen started as a trial period. No pressure, no big commitment — just two people figuring out if they work well together.\n\n5. Your network is your recruiting pool — expand it deliberately\n\nThis is where I get a little passionate, because it's exactly why I built Angel Squad. \n\nThe founders who find great early teams quickly are almost always the ones who've been \\*in community\\* before they needed anything. They've been showing up to events, helping others, sharing knowledge, building relationships without an agenda.\n\nWhen you need a CTO and you've spent the last year genuinely connecting with engineers, developers, and technical folks — you have people to call. When you need a co-founder and you've been lurking silently? You're starting from zero.\n\nInvest in community before you need it. Seriously.\n\n\n\nBuilding a founding team when you have nothing but a vision is a sales job. You're selling your conviction, your work ethic, and your judgment. \n\nThe founders who crack this aren't necessarily the ones with the best ideas. They're the ones who've done enough groundwork that joining them feels less like a leap of faith and more like an obvious opportunity.\n\nGet something real in front of people. Make it easier to say yes. And find people who are already losing sleep over the same problem you are. That's your founding team.",

Most good operators know how risky that is. So instead of convincing strangers, a lot of founders pull from past coworkers, classmates, or people they have shipped projects with before. Shared scars matter more than a well researched gap.\n\nAnother pattern I have seen is starting with contractors or part time collaborators to get an MVP out. Once there is traction, even small traction, the equity conversation changes. Risk goes down, belief goes up.\n\nOn the salary issue, sometimes the honest answer is you need to bootstrap enough to pay at least something. Even a modest stipend signals commitment. Expecting someone to take zero cash while you “figure it out” can feel asymmetric.\n\nAlso worth asking yourself, are you looking for a co founder to fill a skill gap, or to validate the idea?

As a sole breadwinner it’s even more so. It often takes founders years — if not decades — to scale to a point where they actually benefit from all that time and effort. If you are dependent on constant stable income, you may want to reconsider.\n\nIt’s also worth remembering that only the top 0.1% of 0.1%s end up as unicorns. The startups that sputter out and die in the dark are never mentioned. And that is almost all of them. There’s a reason why venture as an industry completely revolves around the power law.\n\nNow, is it possible — even more than ever — to scale a small company to $100M+ ARR? Yes. Is it easy? Obviously no. Does $100M+ ARR actually mean the company will get to a meaningful exit and founder equity will be realize? No. Things are moving so fast, and hitting big revenues is only 1 small part of the equation. \n\nBeing a founder is also not a get rich quick scheme. It’s one of the hardest jobs in the world, and isn’t something to be underestimated. You see all this opportunity going by and want to get it on it. That’s understandable. Just be aware about how difficult it is. \n\nThe best advice I can give is to consider joining a startup instead of starting one. Employee stock options can give you very meaningful future equity, while still being able to make income. But I both have no idea what kind of income you’d need to subsist, and what skills you have that a startup would want.",

By all other measures, being a young founder is a disadvantage because you lack the domain knowledge, accumulated skill, and valuable network that comes with 10-20 years of working in an industry.\n\nIf you're really motivated, work on your startup on evenings and weekends. Going \"all-in\" is just a story people like telling to make themselves sound more courageous than they are, when in reality there was a safety net the whole time.",

You want people thinking wait this is literally me.  \nIf it’s “first of its kind” that’s actually harder because you have to educate. So show the before and after. Show the messy current way vs your flow in 20 seconds. Raw screen recordings are fine. Overproduced kills trust early.  \nAlso small pilot > fake hype. Get 20 users obsessed and talking.

The two GTM guys will generate so much pipeline then resent the engineer for not building fast enough to keep it warm. In turn, the engineer will resent the GTM guys for not having as much work as he/she does.\n\nThe best founder’s aren’t binary. You’ll want the 3rd co-founder somewhere in between builder and GTM.

Right now we’re at roughly €600 MRR.\n\nSo the situation is weird:\n\n\t•\tWe have a product that works\n\n\t•\tUnit economics are not terrible\n\n\t•\tBut we only have about €6k left in the bank\n\n\t•\tWe are fundraising, but it’s hard because:\n\n\t•\tVCs don’t love B2C\n\n\t•\tVCs don’t love EdTech\n\n\t•\tOur size is still very small\n\nAlso, the founders are currently not paying ourselves, so we’re basically working for free.\n\nWe feel stuck in a limbo:\n\n\t•\tnot big enough to attract serious capital\n\n\t•\tnot funded enough to scale fast\n\n\t•\tnot dead either, because the product actually has traction\n\nI’m considering a few options and I’d love your opinion:\n\n\t1.\tExpand into B2B (schools, tutors, training centers, etc.) to improve cash flow and credibility\n\n\t2.\tStay focused on B2C and push harder on one acquisition channel\n\n\t3.\tBuild adjacent micro-apps in the same vertical (basically cloning parts of our product into more focused tools), to capture users with a single specific need and funnel them into the main product\n\n\t4.\tSomething else I’m not seeing\n\nIf you were in this position, what would you do in the next 3–6 months?",

          "text": "\"VCs don’t love B2C  \nVCs don’t love EdTech\" There are many things a VC will say they do not like; however, there is only really one thing they do like, makinig a return on their investment, the more return a business can make them, the better. Such a love is universal. So then all you would ever need to do is show a VC you are capable of making them money in the future. If after showing a VC your profit potential they are still not intrested in your business, it either means you have overestimated your future profits by a wide margin, or you were incapable of effectivly articulating your products value.\n\n\"not big enough to attract serious capital  \nnot funded enough to scale fast  \nnot dead either, because the product actually has traction\" Every business goes through this stage. It is not possible for a business to go from a startup to a business big enough for serious capital, without first transitioning through a period where they were not big enough for serious capital.\n\n\"I’m considering a few options....... Expand into B2B\" May I ask why you havent already expanded into B2B?",

Instead think about integrations. Make your app plug into workflows people already depend on so ripping it out becomes painful.

      "text": "Hi guys I wanted to ask for help on career advice that maybe some of you can relate to.\n\nI am a couple years out of undergrad where I studied computer engineering, and interned at big tech and startup in the West Coast. Right after college I joined my family business (manufacturing and wholesale of CPG), and I’ve done decently well. At this point I am done following my family’s footsteps and I am interested in pursuing working in the tech industry again, esp with all of the exciting AI Startups now (would be a dream to get into YC and start a software startup of my own).\n\nI have been experimenting with vibe coding tools like cursor and Claude, and I have been making some prototypes for a B2B saas idea. I understand that for it to truly be a legit software startup, I am nowhere close to that.\n\nI was thinking that I should get a job within a tech startup/corporate first in order to learn the ropes so that I would have the right experience to start my own thing. I have a few classmates from college in YC but I personally don’t feel I have the chops they’re hiring for, since they’re hiring ppl from big tech. It’s been several years so I’ve incredibly rusty in my technical skills, and I have high doubts about my employability since ive only worked in B2B sales and distribution in the physical product space, and idk how transferable any of my skills are from my family business. I know that currently the tech industry is not doing well in terms of hiring people.\n\nShould I go to grad school and get enough technical skills for me to start my own startup, or am I just fantasizing about the AI boom at the moment and I should just be realistic and stick with my family business that is already doing well? I am just so fascinated by all the advancements of AI that I would honestly love to be part of this societal growth and I do not have much interest in my family industry at all.\n\nAny feedback or advice is absolutely appreciated. I understand this sort of post is a bit different from the other posts and I will accept the hate but this is a genuine struggle that I have been dealing with for months. Thank you so much",

For the last decade, getting through the maze required months of research, customer interviews, and pattern recognition that took real time to accumulate. Now you can prompt your way through a surprisingly complete version of the maze in a weekend. Competitive landscape, failure modes of previous attempts, regulatory considerations, unit economics benchmarks. It's all there. Which means the maze is no longer the moat  \nWhat's actually hard to replicate now: founder-market fit that goes beyond research. The kind that comes from having lived inside a problem for years. Distribution relationships built over time. The willingness to do the specific unglamorous thing that makes a market work before it's obvious\n\nIntelligence and information are increasingly commoditized. What's your theory of what actually differentiates founders now?",

When reaching out before you arrive, keep it personal and specific. Rather than a mass message, reference something they’ve built or written that connects to your background or goals. Point out exactly why you’re reaching out to them, not just any founder. I’ve met people in SF who genuinely enjoy making connections if there’s a shared sense of purpose or an interesting angle, especially if you are coming from a field like law intersecting with AI. Also, DM groups on Twitter/X can be surprisingly high signal, and founder specific Slack communities like Launch House, On Deck, and South Park Commons are worth applying to, even for a short stay. A lot of the best relationships I’ve seen form from working on a small side project together, or serendipitous intros through mutual friends after a few in person meetings.\n\nStructuring your month, I’d spend your first week meeting as many people as possible (intros, events, walks, dinners), then double down with follow ups for deeper conversations with people who seem aligned. If you’re interested, I actually just opened my AI agent platform’s waitlist at [https://salespire.io](https://salespire.io) for early users building at this intersection. Happy to chat if you want to see how it works or just swap notes about navigating SF as a builder.",

If we open a C-Corp, raise a round, issue equity, and proceed…GREAT if it works. But if startup fails, we’ve escalated structure and dilution earlier than we might otherwise.\n\nHesitation isn’t about belief in the product. It’s about timing and structure.\n\nQuestions for founders who’ve been here:\n\n1.\tIs converting to a C-Corp and accepting early dilution justified at this stage for an anchor partner? What if they don’t actually proceed (they know how early we are)\n\n2 should we say ‘bye’ to this prospect and find first clean enterprise pilot client (no equity loss) to get more leverage with investors?\n\n3 what if we can’t close with investors and we’re stuck with this C-corp?\n\n4 How painful (and costly) is it realistically if a C-Corp needs to be shut  down and you’ve issued stock?\n\n5 Both founders financial runway is low, what if we get freelance or full time jobs, can/should we still operate a c corp?\n\nLooking for grounded feedback from people who’ve navigated this fork.",

          "text": "On the C-Corp timing question:\n\nIncorporating as a C-Corp is inevitable if you're going to raise VC money and scale. The question is just \\*when\\*. The cost of incorporating (Stripe Atlas, Clerky, etc.) is like $500-2k. That's not the scary part. The scary part is issuing equity before you have clarity on valuation and terms.\n\n\n\nOn the anchor partner wanting equity:\n\nThis is a yellow flag for me. Pilot customers paying for pilots = normal. Pilot customers taking equity = complicated. A few things to think through:\n\n\\- What % are they asking for? If it's meaningful, that's a problem for future investors who will see that cap table and ask questions\n\n\\- Is this actually their standard ask, or is this an accelerator trying to extract value from their portfolio companies?\n\n\\- Have you talked to other founders who went through this same accelerator?\n\n\n\nOn your specific questions:\n\n1. Early dilution to an anchor partner is only justified if they're a genuine reference customer who will actively sell for you, not just use you. \"Willing to move forward\" is not the same as \"will be our champion and close our next 10 deals\"\n\n2. I wouldn't say bye yet, but I'd push back hard on the equity piece. Negotiate. The pilot payment should be enough for a stage-appropriate relationship. If they won't move without equity, that tells you something about how they see the power dynamic here.\n\n3. Stuck with a C-Corp and no investors is annoying but manageable. You can keep it dormant cheaply. Delaware franchise taxes are the main cost (\\~$400/yr minimum). Not a catastrophe.\n\n4. Shutting down a C-Corp with issued stock requires consent from stockholders, filing dissolution paperwork, and potentially some legal fees. Painful? Moderate. Expensive? A few thousand dollars if it's clean. The messier the cap table, the messier the wind-down.\n\n5. Yes, absolutely you can hold jobs and operate a C-Corp. Tons of founders do this. Just make sure your employment agreements don't have IP assignment clauses that would conflict. Read those carefully.\n\n\n\nThe real risk here isn't the C-Corp structure. It's anchoring your entire fundraising narrative to one client who is giving you conditional signals. Investors are going to ask \"what's the status with your anchor customer?\" and \"we're in conversations\" is a weak answer that can actually hurt you.\n\nIf you're going to go down this path, get something in writing from them first. An LOI, a signed pilot agreement, \\*something\\* before you restructure your company around their requirements.",

              "text": "incredible feedback. Thank you.. here goes:\n\non the anchor partner wanting equity: they haven't given the number yet. But its a risk thing for them. Also they see it as an opportunity cost for leveraging their name/reputational value. And its them seeing the future value and wanting a piece. Its an accelerator/incubator piece of a large institution. I have not talked to others who went through it, but will look and see if I can find.\n\n1. they will be genuine reference partner. Will negotiate hard to get several ideas in writing for this. They will not sell for us, but I'd want them in the sales process as reference/case study on calls etc\n\n2. Will push hard / negotiate.\n\n3. Good to know, I've heard similar.\n\n4. Great insight.. so if for some reason a stockholder says no then you cannot shut it down? and you're stuck with operational fees each year because of it? unless you have a smart clause in a contract.\n\n5. ok got it. \n\nThis anchor prospect is the furthest along .. we have others in the pipeline we're warming up. No surprise, but what we do need is data / case study as soon as possible to leverage with others. Am going to ask for an LOI yes..\n\n  \n",

I’m someone who has always been fascinated about entrepreneurship and wanted to build something of my own with everything that I’ve got in me.   \nGrew up consuming a lot of business podcasts, youtube videos, following startups that then became the next big name, a lot of Shark-Tank and Dragon’s Den episodes, and a ton of case-studies of both success and failure.

(Yes, I am referring to Shark-Tank here) Never really had the opportunity to actually learn about how fundraising actually works.

How do you prepare? You get me? (Basically every detail that revolves around the entire process of the same.   \n  \nI have watched a lot of these explainer contents, but somehow, they do feel incomplete, and don’t look like the missing piece of the puzzle.

      "text": "Over the last few weeks we’ve been fine-tuning open-weight models for a project, and honestly… the hardest part wasn’t improving the model.\n\nIt was everything around it.\n\n* CUDA mismatches\n* Driver conflicts\n* OOM crashes mid-run\n* Broken DeepSpeed/FSDP configs\n* Half-maintained GitHub repos\n* Spinning up GPU instances only to realize something subtle is misconfigured\n\nWe ended up writing our own wrappers just to stabilize training + logging + checkpointing.\n\nAnd then separately built:\n\n* Basic eval scripts\n* Cost tracking\n* Dataset versioning hacks\n* Deployment glue\n\nIt feels like every small AI team is rebuilding the same fragile stack.\n\nWhich makes me wonder:\n\nWhy doesn’t something exist where you can:\n\n* Select an open-weight model\n* Upload/connect a dataset\n* Choose LoRA/full fine-tune\n* See real-time loss + GPU usage + cost\n* Run built-in eval\n* Deploy with one click\n\nBasically an opinionated “control plane” for fine-tuning.\n\nNot another generic MLOps platform.  \nNot enterprise-heavy.  \nJust simple and focused on LLM specialization.\n\nCurious:\n\n* Is this pain common or are we just bad at infra?\n* What part of LLM fine-tuning annoys you most?\n* Would you use something like this, or do you prefer full control?\n\nWould genuinely love feedback before we go deeper building this.",

A lightweight eval setup you can run in under a minute does more for velocity than any wrapper around DeepSpeed.",
