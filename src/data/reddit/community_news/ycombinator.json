I’ve spent months building something technically complex and stressful to execute, and we’re now near launch.\n\nHere’s the honest problem: I understand marketing conceptually, but I don’t execute distribution well. I’m not good on camera. I stutter. I don’t naturally push myself into visibility.\n\nI can build systems. I can ship. I can handle product depth. Growth and narrative are not my strengths.\n\nIf anyone here has taken this path successfully, I’d appreciate your insight — and I’m open to conversations.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Update - Mon 9 Feb :** Appreciate the insights and support here. It pushed me to record a short intro and submit my VC application. Stepping outside my comfort zone.\n\n  \nOnward.",

Here is what helped me. \n\n1. Understand the ‘why’ behind the fear: For me it was the thought of being judged. And what i realized is Great, people are great (Ignore what you see in Insta). They are supportive and willing to have a meaningful conversation. There is a lot of support we can get if we just ask. \nAnd that brings me to the second point\n\n2. Be part of community: there are a lot of people in the same phase. You are not alone, and as you need support they need it too. Do not connect with them with an idea of selling or receiving something, rather have a giving mindset. Contribute to a conversation, with no hidden agenda. \n\n3. Relationships over transactions: it takes aprox 3 connect moments for a person to remember you. Build relationships, sales will happen eventually. \n\nDont wanna sound to preachy, but i know its tough as an introvert to go and connect. Something you can try is go to an event this week, even if you go and not meet anyone, its still better than not going :)",

Find the Discord servers, Slack groups, and subreddits where your buyers hang out. Be helpful. Answer questions. No pitch, just value. Eventually people ask what you do.\n\n3. Partnerships over cold outreach. Find someone who already has your audience and figure out how to help them.

Ideally, you have contacts you already know, people you're not afraid to speak to. Maybe some of them can gove you feedback, test your product or even pre-order or buy it? I mean, it doesn't need to be a public marketing campaign. It can start by a few you already know. As long as your product is good (does the job, no matter how it looks like), they will start doing the best marketing job for you, for free: word of mouth.\n\nHowever, there's something you need to deal with, and I'm there myself too: to sell you need to be able to create tension. At some point you need to say something that puts other people in a position where they need to make a decision. It might feel uncomfortable but unless they're already 100% convinced, you'll have to give them a push.\n\nI'm learning this myseld at the moment.\nSo, let's get our entrepreneurial job done, let's sell and get paid!",

Surprising part: the more we wrestled with the questions, the more clearly we understood the product, the users, and ourselves. We trimmed jargon, tightened the problem, and built tiny proofs instead of big promises. A few lessons we’re taking with us:\n\n* YC questions are a mirror. If an answer is fuzzy, the product is probably fuzzy.\n* “Why now?” forced us to look beyond hype and pinpoint a real shift.\n* User conversations beat deck polishing every time.\n* Cutting scope isn’t defeat; it’s speed.\n* Numbers calm nerves. Rough unit economics exposed weak assumptions.\n* Write -> sleep -> rewrite. Clarity compounds.\n\nWe also came away more honest about risk: what must be true, what could kill us, and what we’ll do next week to reduce uncertainty. Regardless of the outcome, the process itself created momentum and better habits: shorter cycles, crisper metrics, and less ego in the roadmap.\n\nTo everyone applying this batch: you've got this. Good luck, back to the grind.",

You aren't going crazy, but you are definitely burning the candle at both ends, and probably the middle, too.\n\nThe 'freelancing for more time' move is a classic trap; clients are often more demanding than bosses because you’re always 'on.' If you're feeling this burnt out and haven't landed a B2B client yet, going back to corporate might actually be the smartest move for your startup. It gives you the financial runway to breathe so you aren't making desperate decisions.\n\nB2B is a marathon. Most teams take 6–12 months of full-time focus to get that first check. Doing it part-time while freelancing is playing on 'Extreme' difficulty. Don't feel like a failure for choosing stability while you refine the product, momentum is easier to build when you aren't worried about the rent.",

How do you balance this?\n\nB2B Reality  \nB2B Infrastructure/SaaS typically takes 6-9 months of full-time effort to get real traction.  \n\\- 3 months to build trust  \n\\- 3 months to navigate procurement/security.  \n\\- 1 month to sign.\n\nYou can't speed up a B2B sales cycle. If money is an issue, look for a boring, low-stress job that doesn't drain your brain. Save up 6 months of runway, then jump.\n\nThe Venture Grade Question  \nFinally, ask yourself if your business actually requires Venture Capital right now.\n\nIf it is not \"Venture Grade\" (aiming for $100M+ revenue), perhaps pursue it as a disciplined, cashflow-generating business instead. This removes the pressure of investor rejection and gives you time to grow the product while spending quality time with your family.\n\nYou can't cross a chasm in two small jumps. Pick the path that lets you leap.\n\nHope this gives you clarity. All the best.",

I second the other reply, I personally think you need to have something stable at the side to balance your early stage start-up.

And as we all know, startups thrive on slow decision making.\n\nThe more *likely* scenario is that...well, the tech side of the organization gets hosed. They will made decisions without any technical expertise providing input, those decisions will suck, and then there will be no one to explain to them why their decisions suck. Then they will throw you guys under the bus, first just in their own heads, but then eventually in reality when they act on what's *in* their heads'.\n\nIf the company is a tech company, you need someone who knows tech in those leadership meetings -- and not just present, but someone with the clout to go toe-to-toe with the rest of the leadership. So they have to be at least on somewhat equal footing with the founders in influence somehow.\n\nAt the very least, ask them these questions, and see what they have to say. I suspect they're going weasel a bit and say \"well, we know a thing or two about what we're trying to build, Q founder will be responsible for you in addition to X, Y, Z responsibilities.\". And then I would be unpersuaded and would run. Whatever they say needs to be DAMN convincing to persuade me to stay.",

          "text": "This will get downvoted because technical people are horribly insecure and social morons, but thats fine.\n\nI work in VC, have founded a company, and over time, I have been amazed at 2 things:\n\n1) most non-technical founders/ idea guys are not actually non-technical founders they are posers. I really hate the phrase “non-technical founder” for this reason because there is a radical difference between some mba who is going to run “business” or “marketing” and someone who doesn’t code, but has a very unique insight to a specific market and can raise capital. There are a ton of people who can say they “have an idea” HOWEVER, a good non-technical founder is way way way more important than a technical hire and it isn’t close. There is a reason zuck and Elon aren’t coding or in the cto role. The #1 reason startups fail isn’t “shipping speed” it’s they build something people don’t actually want or solve a problem that isn’t actually acute enough, or they mismanage cash. YC optimizes for someone technical because otherwise you aren’t going to be able to build something. But don’t get it twisted—knowing what to build is actually the hard part and that’s so overwhelmingly obvious to anyone that has invested. The whole point of a seed round is to find product market fit.\n\n2) technical people are some of the most arrogant antisocial, naive people I have ever met. They could win an award for most wasted talent due to being a social moron. I say this due to watching sometimes brilliant people overplay their hand, set hard rules, not understand fundraising/capital markets and just be so flipping arrogant about their value as “builders”. A great example of this is thinking all equity grants can be compared across companies. Thinking 2% for a founding engineer role for a SaaS company with customers and a previously existed CEO should be compared to a 5% grant at an AI company with a 24 year old ceo is the sort of dumb math technical people do. Ultimately, it tends to be more about their egos and insecurity than rational business decisions. I would avoid this if I were you.\n\nNow, for this situation, it seems like the non-technical person is legit with a prior huge exit, market validation, and they can fundraise. This massively derisks the venture and they are way further along than would justify you being a cofounder.\n\nYou need to make a calculated bet on 2 things:\n1) how big could the company be?\n2) how much do they respect technical people or have quasi understanding?\n\nIf the equity offer is very low, that says something. Likewise, I’d just ask what their plans are for a CTO and how your role could grow and change. You should also be able to ask questions about the vision, your role, and what they find important in their product to reveal technical attitude. \n\nIt is possible for someone to be a subject matter expert and brilliant manager who doesn’t code, but is able to learn and heed the advice of technical people around them. It’s only a red flag if the non-technical people show a complete lack of competence or interest in understanding technical limitations and don’t value technical product constraints at all.\n\nSo, in other words, there are no rules, with startups everything is highly specific to the company. Don’t be the classic technical moron trope, but make sure the non-technical people are more like Sam A, zuck or Elon with a decent understanding and aptitude to talk with you about technical challenges otherwise you will have a bad time.",

But the truth is, the counterparty might just be ranting. Not every conversation requires a solution; sometimes it just requires understanding.\n\n1. Startup Sales NOT EQUAL MNC Sales\nBuilding a startup is very different from doing sales at a giant like Microsoft. At Microsoft, you are capturing existing demand. In a startup, the value proposition requires intense scrutiny.\n\nJust because we think it is useful doesn't mean it’s true. But likewise, just because the market says \"we don't need this\" doesn't mean you stop.\n\n- I remember when Internet Banking in the 90s was viewed with disgust by bank CEOs.\n\n- I remember when Java was viewed with deep skepticism by the CTOs of that era.\n\nYou have to see the \"shift in the sand\" before the market does. The early stage isn't about selling to everyone; it's about finding the specific beachhead that allows you to prove the innovation works.\n\n2. Process over Personality\nSales isn't just about being an extrovert. It's a process.\n\n- What objections did I handle well?\n\n- Did I segment the prospect correctly?\n\n- Is the value prop aligned?\n\nThis is an ongoing loop. We actually just build an internal \"AI co-pilot\" just to ensure we stay aligned and consistent when we go to market. It keeps us honest to the process.\n\n3. The \"Trusted Expert\"\nThere are different sales personalities. You have the \"Openers\" (great at cracking doors open), but you also have the \"Trusted Experts\" (technical authority).\nThis is why VCs often prefer teams over solo founders. You can tag-team: one relationship builder, one technical expert.\n\nIf you are a technical founder, don't try to be the \"loud salesperson.\" Be the expert who builds the future. It is part of the business building and personal growth journey.\n\nHope this helps. All the best.",

          "text": "Been in a very similar spot when I started. Went to school for data science/ML. Entered the marketing/distribution side by force around 5 years ago now. Some tips I find helpful NOW that I learned the hard way:\n\n**1. Pick ONE product and go all in on distribution**\n\nSeems straight forward, but it's a lot easier to ship multiple things when you can spend money to delegate.. otherwise you're spreading yourself thin. \n\nMultiple products means multiple audiences, multiple messaging strategies, multiple funnels.. all competing for your limited time and energy. This doesn't have to be a long process either. You can get something growing in a couple months if you're super intentional.\n\n**2. Get in the room where decisions happen**\n\nYou're in Dubai.. so already a good start. But even if you don't go to in person stuff then start connecting with more people online. Value-trading circles, low cost paid communities, programs, etc.\n\nThat's actually a massive advantage right now. The AI ecosystem there is growing fast and there's real money flowing into enterprise solutions. But you can't access it without connecting with the right people quickly.\n\n**3. Build distribution into the product itself**\n\nThe best AI products right now aren't just tools, they're things people talk about and share because using them makes the user look smart or saves them something obvious. \n\nThink about what would make someone send your tool to a colleague unprompted. If you can't answer that clearly, the product might work fine but it has no built-in growth loop. A good place for inspiration is always the B2C world (like simple viral apps).\n\n**4. Content is the biggest advantage right now (and has been for a few years)**\n\nYou can build production-ready AI in under a week. Most people can't. \n\nYou can share the process. You can share the products. You can share tutorials. You can share literally anything. If the products solve real problems, then consistency should reward you within a few weeks (even if it's a very small reward). \n\n**Bonus: Validate before you build the next one**\n\nThis is the big one. And I say it with love because I've made this exact mistake multiple times.\n\nBefore you write a single line of code on the next idea, get 5 people to tell you they'd pay for it. Not \"that's cool\" or \"yeah I'd probably use that.\" Actual commitment. A waitlist signup, a pre-order, a deposit, something with friction. OR if you're not comfortable doing that yet, leverage direct outreach on LinkedIn or email and at least start having the meetings and conversations during the process.\n\nThe direct outreach paired with a decent amount of content would easily get you in front of a few thousand people meaningfully a week.. once it builds momentum it could rise from there. It's also a lot easier to run and scale ads once you validate angles with organic so that's another perk.",

The fastest path I've seen for technical founders is finding where your target users are already venting about problems, then building exactly what they're asking for. For B2B stuff, Reddit is actually huge for this because enterprise buyers are searching Google for solutions and Reddit threads rank at the top now.\n\nThe challenge is most technical people either can't do the community engagement piece (too slow, sounds promotional) or they get banned trying. Some B2B companies just hire a done-for-you service to handle Reddit engagement for them instead of trying to do it themselves. Community Mentions is one I came across recently that handles the research, posting, and compliance side so you're actually showing up in conversations where peopel are activley looking.\n\nMight be worth exploring since it sounds like you can ship fast but need a distribution channel that doesn't require you to guess what to build next.",

      "text": "Several months ago (when we were in the earliest stages of the “idea maze”), we launched a landing page test. Many well-recommended books (e.g., The Lean Startup) recommended running landing page tests as an efficient way to validate if potential users/customers were interested in the solution you have to offer. \n\n\n\nThe idea is to (1) build a landing page describing the problem you aim to solve and how your solution will address it, (2) drive traffic to your landing page, and (3) consider your idea validated if enough people engage with your landing page (e.g., sign up, attempt to pay, etc.).\n\n\n\nFor us, this didn’t work. \n\n\n\nFirst, (1) was non-trivial. We used Framer for the landing page, but (since I’m not a web designer), it took some time to become familiar with all the bells and whistles of their app (in fact, I still don't fully know the difference between ‘stacks’, ‘frames’, ‘containers’....). \n\n\n\nSecond (and more importantly), (2) IS NOT EASY. We ran ads on X, and generated a bunch of traffic. The issue though was that nearly all of that traffic (>98%?) seemed to be from bots. Of course, it’s hard to say for sure if they were bots or just people who came, saw our message and weren’t interested, but given that the vast majority stayed on the page for significantly less than 1 sec (which is incredibly hard / unlikely for an actual person), it’s safe to say they were likely bots. \n\n\n\nUltimately, we stopped the landing page test and chose to focus on talking to more (actual) people. This was incredibly valuable, helped shape our MVP, and actually got us to our first few customers.\n\n\n\nIt’s obviously no surprise that talking to users works. But I would’ve thought landing page tests would’ve been a bit more insightful (though, again, maybe it’s just us).",

You can try directly pitching potential customers as if it's a B2B product just to get your first couple dozen users and get some feedback.\n\nOnce you have at least a handful of users who stick around (really stick around, as in 1 or 2 months after signing up, they're using you every day if you're a social app or have purchased every month if you're ecommerce), then you just try lots of things for how to reach people like them.  Whatever you do, don't spend on paid ads until you've solved retention.\n\nAlso, it's a trap I've fallen into myself as a technical founder - you should be forcing yourself to spend at least 50% of your time on acquisition, and maybe more than that, \\*especially\\* now that building is so much faster. If you have no users, you have not spent at least as much time on getting customers as you did building the product, and your instinct is to build more features or pivot into a completely different space, you need to silence that instinct and get to work on acquisition.",

Early advisory grants are typically in the \\~0.25–1% range, vesting over 1–2 years. The number should reflect leverage, not hours. Someone who makes introductions and shapes outcomes is worth more than someone who gives occasional feedback.\n\nWhen choosing an advisor, I’d optimize for pattern recognition over prestige. You want someone who has seen your stage and your type of problems before. A big name who doesn’t understand your customer is less useful than an operator who’s navigated similar constraints.\n\nEffectiveness mostly comes down to structure. The best relationships feel like lightweight board meetings: clear agenda, written updates, specific asks, and tracked follow-ups. If meetings drift into casual chats, value drops fast.\n\nFrom a criteria standpoint, I’d look for sharp thinking, reliability, and genuine excitement about your problem. Advisors who challenge you productively are far more valuable than those who just validate your decisions.\n\nMost strong advisors come through warm founder intros, angels in your space, or targeted outreach to operators who built something adjacent to what you’re doing. Specific context beats a generic advisor who asks every time.\n\nThe biggest mistake founders make is treating advisors as a badge instead of a working tool. The right advisor should increase clarity and accelerate decisions, not just look good on a slide.",

When I showed up at the gym, the activation code didn't work. I wrote an email to their support, but it took them days to reply. I couldn't use the gym, and neither could others. I told them over email that their system sucked. I mentioned I'm a software engineer and if they needed help, they could just reach out and I would help them hook things up.\n\nOne week later, one of the co-founders replied that they might need help. Another week passed and they started asking questions. After about 10 emails, I built them an MVP for a recurring payment processor with PayU (the only payment processor they were able to get a contract from in the region). That fixed their initial problem, but it took us 6 months to integrate with the door-locking company, which was from Sweden.\n\nThe initial product was full of bugs; it was an insane amount of work doing it alone (this was pre-AI). One day, I woke up to hundreds of emails from the gym's customers complaining because the system had double-charged everyone. It didn't have proper reporting, and the founders chased me for months to build it. They used my system regardless of it having the clunkiest UI ever, lacking basic features, so it still required an insane amount of manual work for them, but it worked and allowed their business to grow. It was better than anything else they could get at the time.\n\nThe system I built processed over $500,000 and allowed them to open multiple locations in the city and expand to other countries. \n\nAlternatives costed about $70-90/mo, but they lacked the specific integrations they needed, so I was able to charge $250-$500/mo (they payed quarterly though).
