      "text": "As the year is wrapping up, I figured I’d share my thoughts from applying to YC twice this year and getting rejected after the interview stage. \n\nMy co-founder and I are 25 years old, both have M.S. degrees from Ivy League schools and have worked at Series A-C startups as team leads within SWE and Quant Research. I argue that we fit the stereotypical YC founder profile. \n\nWe started building on our idea in April, 2025, after identifying a problem that both of us faced. By September, we had a demo of the consumer app ready. We got around 25 of our friends to try it out over a month and give feedback. Based on the feedback, we iterated core features and derived our solution for the problem we identified. \n\nWe applied on the last day to the F25 batch, and 3 days later, we received an invitation to interview with YC in-person. As you can imagine, our adrenaline was pumping and we felt like we were on top of the world. Imagine having built a prototype in a few months as a first time entrepreneur and now the most prestigious incubator flies you out to San Francisco for a few days. When I got accepted to my M.S., it felt somewhat casual. But this? Completely different. Personally, this meant the world to me.\n\nFast forward to after the interview. We felt it went fantastic. However, 2 days later, we got an email from YCombinator.. I am not going to cover the feedback, but that was a reality check. Getting rejected sucks and it is not something I am used to. I lost a few nights of sleep over it.\n\nThis made me realize something. Being an entrepreneur, owning your own product and outcomes, despite the highs and the lows, beats working on someone else's company in exchange for a salary. I had one of the best few days of my life in SF, interviewing with YC. Therefore, I decided to quit my job the next week. I couldn’t continue working on something else. How could I ever justify giving away my time for a salary I don’t really need (I had saved enough to sustain for a couple of years, yes, I am very fortunate that way). \n\nWe took the feedback from YC, and decided that if we implement everything by W26, then they have to accept us. Right? Along the way, we even rejected offers with similar terms from other VCs because we were, and still are, set that YCombinator is the best path forward for us.\n\nFast forward three months, our app was not live yet, but it was up and running for 50 test users. A fully functioning MVP, and we thought we had nailed messaging and our initial market. But something felt off. At this stage, I knew a bit more about what it means to create a startup. Enough to realize that we had unproven gaps, and 3 months at YC might not be enough to fill them before raising another round. \n\nWe remained optimistic but on the last day, 30 min after the deadline (depends if you are east or west coast I guess), we got rejected. But for some reason that felt like the right decision. Don’t get me wrong, I would love to be part of YC. However, we shouldn’t partner with YC until we can extract the maximum amount of value from the program. Ask yourself: “Why are you applying to YC?”. If your goal is to be part of YCombinator, then I don’t think you’re dreaming big enough. The goal is not YCombinator, the goal is building a company around a product that you care about. \n\nLooking back at this year, I wanted to reflect on what I have learnt and how grateful I am for the feedback and reality checks that YCombinator gave us.\n\nBeing a founder is difficult, and it comes with a rollercoaster of emotions. One day you are on-top of the world, the other you can’t sleep trying to figure out what you did wrong. It is a constant push and pull. And given that I am only 8 months in, I can’t even imagine what is to come. And you know what? There is no reason for me to even think about it. \n\nI fully believe in our product, my co-founder, and myself. Rejection is part of life. All you can do is take the feedback, drop your ego, and continue pushing. This is not easy, but if I have realized anything, it is 100% worth it. \n\nTo everyone out there struggling, keep going. You have not failed until you give up, and sometimes, rejection can be a good thing.\n\nEDIT:\nLots of ppl asking what we are building. I am not looking to promote but this is prob easier than answering comments and DMs: [krona](https://mykrona.com)",

              "text": "You’re very misinformed.\n\nYC has never been about the money. The specific deal they give isn’t the best economically - lots of VCs offer way better terms than them. YC is about:\n\n- the speed (during the 3 months program almost everybody who has done it has said “I have unlocked a new level of productivity, I didn’t even know I had in me”). YC is like going to a gym where everybody is a pro power lifter, you become one by osmosis (or at least improve a lot)\n\n- economically! I’ll contradict what I said above with further details. Sure you dilute yourself a bit with the $500k deal, but at the demo day you’re able to raise a big seed at 2-4x the standard market rates; thus at the end diluting yourself less with more money in the bank. + you get to do YC - an amazing deal!\n\n- the people! With your batchmates and partners, a sort of brotherhood / family is formed and people are truly helpful and supportive in trying to achieve something extremely hard. Not to mention that nearly everyone from the batchmates, alumni’s and partners are amongst the best experts, PhDs, programmers, scientists there are. Many of them have founded and led massive companies and have significant insight and influence - not too bad if you ask me…\n\n- the brand - obvious but it does help a lot when you’re a small scrappy startup nobody believes in and such an important institution backs you.\n\nAlso I’m not sure where you got the “aristocratic society” thing from. I can assure you that are people from all walks of life (I myself come from a normal family in Europe).",

I have extensive domain and business expertise. I did not apply to any other accelerators, only YC because YC offers quite a bit of reduction on search cost to VCs. It is not necessary for success, but I do appreciate the value. We are about to publicly launch, and I am about to get on a seed round raise independently. I am surprised I didn't get a serious look, with a product, early traction, and expertise, but I also know there are a lot of good teams out there. You don't open any door you don't try, so I try. Now that YC moved on, I will move on as well, but applying has definitely gave me additional motivation to work. Cheers!",

Getting those first customers is honestly one of the hardest parts, especially when you're trying to validate if you're even building something people want.\n\nThe waitlist thing is interesting though. I've noticed a lot of founders treat waitlists as validation, but YC seems to want actual paying customers or at least people actively using the product. Makes sense since a waitlist is just interest, not proof you've solved a real problem.\n\nWhat were the biggest lessons you took away from going through the process twice? Always curious what changes between attempts.",

As someone who has both technical and business/marketing experience, it's been extremely interesting a fun venture to continue to grow. Something that definitely helped us is to launch a V2 of our resource that was fully free. We spoke to and surveyed nearly 50 of our users and asked them what exactly they liked/didn't like. We then poured those insights into our V2. \n\nI personally think sustainable growth is something that I value, so adding only 1 user per week is and continues to be the goal through the future. So far we've blown that goal out of the water for a majority of weeks. \n\nI have no plans of raising seed funding, and frankly see bootstrapping as a more effective method of making decisions for myself.",

If they answer without information what worked for you it should be ok\n12. scale\n\nAlong the steps you might consider raising a round. After 12 you defenetely should.\n\nIf you have a product people care deeply and share with their friends faster than you can hire sales - hire engineers and one good marketing guy.

Because of that, i missed out on multiple potential clients, some who showed interest, some i had demos planned with. Does anyone have a similar experience, if so, how do you deal with it and staying on track even tho you feel like you can do anything about. Any advices are appreciated 🙏.\n\nI also wanted to mention that I'm a solo founder and only have another person working for me as an advisor. \n\nThanks",

Can develop strong models to solve problems but the chasm of taking a model and packaging it as a product is something I completely lack. I usually just hand it off to engineering and they do the job. Tried to shadow but management said not on their time.\n\nI’ve built solutions using Streamlit internally, but the process doesn’t expose me to backend framework as much as I’d like to work with. I now have more time than usual in learning new things and I’d like to develop the product engineering muscle: setting up infrastructure, spinning up hosts, building out an MVC site, the whole product engineering flow basically.\n\nWhat courses or literature you found helpful to help you bridge or close this gap? I can code fine but I honestly would like to develop that SWE muscle that I know I lack. I considered UPenns MCIT (basically a BS in CS wrapped up in MS but without all the electives and general Ed) but I felt that it’s too focused on theory.\n\nMy intention is to develop my own product. I’ve built few sites long time back when jQuery was cool but I need to definitely upgrade my knowledge with the latest stack and best practices of today.\n\nEDIT: Botched the title but basically looking for resources to develop product engineering skills so I can dive into the startup world",

But over time I realised this is part of the process to go through, and I am trying to learn this and genuinely trying to connect with them without selling them anything. \n\nSince I was also serving other clients for their own products, I realised everyone needed a tool that can help them validate their idea / product. And what's even more exciting here is that you can do customer interview meetings and talk to your potential customers easily via AI customer persona. (Sorry to shamelessly plug this here, but this couldn't be more related than what I have gone through before). I still believe there is nothing better than talking to people personally and in real life but the next best things could be [launchcheck.me](http://launchcheck.me) \n\nThis is free to use and not only you can validate your idea in detail but also talk to you AI customer persona (which you will be amazed about as you won't be able to differentiate if its a human or an AI customer). It gives you a blunt truth about your idea and no biased thoughts. While this tool is still in progress but phase 1 is still meaningful and usable. \n\nLet me know if this helps you in some way and if you have any feedback for me.",

Things moving fast. \n\nIt’s clearly a challenge (sleep organization essentially and lack of free time), but nothing impossible. \n\nMy 2 cents : \n\n- make clear with your partner that you’re an early stage entrepreneur (you cannot just “stepback” for a few months in your 9to5 job) \n\n- You need help (partner, family,…) and take as maximum as you can. Budget babysitters if needed you’ll see quickly the payback \n\n- Make also clear to yourself that you need a bit of free time, like sports or whatever. Work + parenting is intense, you need cooloff time for you.",

It was way more challenging when she reached 2-3 years and dropped the midday nap. But depends on the baby, some are not so good sleepers, have tummy pain, up all night, etc. Also depends on your support system, if family members or others are available to babysit here and there. But I think it's much easier than managing a kid while having a 9-to-5 job.",
