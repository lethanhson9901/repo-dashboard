      "text": "So me and my friend are applying to YC, however something I’m concerned about is the disparity in qualifications between us. I am an undergraduate student who has done a research position at my university and an internship. I am set to be the CTO. In contrast, my friend (CEO) has a PhD, has worked in industry extensively, and is nearly twice my age. \n\nI personally don’t have issues working with him, and he clearly respects my skills enough that he suggested we do a 50/50 split, but I’m curious if this level of skill imbalance with cause any problems. Another thing reinforcing this is the technology we plan to pursue is derivative directly of his PhD work, and he owns the patent for the work.\n\nI do not have any issues working with him on this technology, as not only is it very interesting, but it’s also in the exact field that I worked on for my research and internship, along with for my art. The plan is for me to do most of the software development while my friend builds the hardware (we’re a hardware company). \n\nWill these imbalances cause any issues and raise red flags when applying?",

          "text": "Honestly the \"imbalance\" youre worried about is actually a strength not a weakness. YC loves teams where one person has deep domain expertise and the other grinds on building the product. The fact that hes a PhD with a patent and youre the one turning it into working software is a pretty clean founder dynamic.I wouldnt stress the equity split stuff too much, 50/50 is fine if you both feel good about it. What YC cares about way more is whether you can actually ship and whether theres real founder chemistry. Focus your application on traction, what youve built so far, and why you two specifically are the team to pull this off. The \"weak CTO\" framing is in your head, not on paper.",

Closed our first 15 customers that way.\n\nThe \"post on LinkedIn / build in public / start a community\" stuff works for some people but it's a full time job on its own and the feedback loop is really slow. You post for 3 months and maybe get a few inbound leads. Versus 20 targeted cold emails where you know within a week if the messaging resonates.\n\nFor B2C though your channel mix is different than mine (we're B2B). Job seekers are high volume low intent so you probably want to think about where they already go when they're frustrated with job searching. Reddit would actually be a good one for you. r/jobs and r/careerguidance have people venting every day about application black holes. If your product actually reduces that friction you could answer those threads genuinely and build a reputation pretty fast.\n\nOne thing I wish someone told me earlier: the channel that works is usually the one that feels uncomfortable. If you're a builder you probably want to hide behind the product. The marketing that works for technical founders is usually the stuff that forces you to talk to people directly.",

The real leverage now is exactly what you said... direction over raw execution. AI (when used right) is basically becoming the solo founder’s force multiplier. Not a brain replacement, but a friction killer.\n\nWhat I’m seeing too: The winners aren’t the ones manually grinding every asset... They’re the ones setting tight feedback loops... Staying close to real user conversations And using AI to compress the execution time between idea - test - signal\n\nYour point about replies and DMs > vanity reach is especially underrated.

You try things, but you don’t really know if it’s improving or not, so you switch too fast or lose confidence haha\n\n\n\nThe channel that really moved things for me was Reddit and targeted content, not generic content. Just replying to posts where the problem already exists. It’s way more effective than posting into the void.\n\n\n\nThe key isn’t choosing the “right channel”, it’s choosing a channel where your ICP is already active, then observing if your actions actually improve results. For example you post 10 times. Do impressions increase. Do visits increase. Do conversions increase. If yes you continue. If not you adjust.\n\n\n\nMost founders don’t fail because they do the wrong marketing, but because they can’t read what’s happening. So they navigate on instinct.\n\n\n\nThat’s exactly why I built Decimly. It lets you clearly see if your marketing is improving or not, and which channel actually deserves your energy. Once you can visually see what works, marketing becomes much simpler man",

          "text": "you're asking the right questions but here's what most people miss: as a solo technical founder, you don't need to master every marketing channel. You need to pick ONE channel where your ideal users are already actively searching for solutions, then show up consistently there. For B2C job platforms, Reddit is actually one of the best options because people constantly post in career subreddits asking for job search advice, complaining about application processes, looking for tools.\n\nThese are high-intent conversations where you can actually be helpful first and mention your product second. The trick is posting genuinely useful advice (templates, strategies, tips) and casually mentioning your tool when it's relevant. The reason most founders fail at Reddit isn't lack of time, it's that they don't understand the culture.\n\nYou get one slightly promotional comment wrong and you're shadowbanned from the subreddit. So validation becomes hard because you're risking your account every time you test. Here's the structured approach: spend 2 weeks just commenting helpful stuff in r/jobs, r/resumes, r/careerguidance without mentioning your product once.\n\nBuild some karma and learn what questions come up repeatedly. Then start occasionally mentioning your platform when it genuinely solves the exact problem someone posted about. Track clicks from your bio link or a simple tracking URL.\n\nIf you really don't want to do this yourself or already tried and got flagged, some B2B companies just use a done-for-you service that handles the research and posting without the spam risk. I've heard good things about Community Mentions for this kind of thing, they basically do Reddit engagement as a service so you don't have to worry about getting banned or spending hours finding the right threads. But even if you go solo on this, the key is committing to one channel for at least 90 days before judging results.\n\nReddit compounds over time becuase your old helpful comments keep getting found in search.",

I can't build features and try to sell the product. I tried to get my wife to be the other half  but it's tough to blend professional with personal. She's never worked for a tech company and just wasn't prepared for the pace or my intensity. But others have said in other posts.. if you have revenue and funding, just to hire a VP of Engineer or other senior (but not co-founder) roles to help lessen the load for you.",

I think the co-founder question should have gotten addressed before you actually started the project because, as a solo founder there is really no break involved even after the product is shipped. This is exactly why co-founders are needed, to avoid this exact question. There is really no break until you exit specially as a solo founder. That is you commitment for retaining 100% equity. The key is to build a small team once your product gains traction that can operate without your input 100% of the time and scale that. ",

The key is making sure the transition does not slow momentum or compromise your vision.\n\nIt is also okay to take a short break, recharge, and step back from introductions.

I assume you are in early stage. Here are some “projects” you can ask them to do to assess whether #1 and #2 holds up\n  a)if you have not engaged any customer yet, you might need a strategic leader who helps define ideal customer profile for your product by doing deep customer discovery work on who is willing to pay for solving the pain point that you think your product solves. \n   b)Doing thorough SWOT analysis of your competitors to come back a set of opportunities. You will know when someone is simply GPTing stuff vs knows what they are talking about when they share such analysis\n    c) for B2B products landing 5 business conversations to hear their feedback is a monumental task\n     d)driving awareness takes $$ but you can also do a lot of manual effort (e. Reddit, LinkedIn ) to drive specific outcomes like week over week increase in #trials.

Often I'll get a sense if someone is knowledgeable to help within the first 1-2 minutes. The same principle could apply to their application process too. I doubt they'd do it all by hand, but if they had to: 40,000 apps / 20 work days / 8 hours per day / 60 minutes per hour = 4.2 apps per minute. Screen some apps instantly, have a few on the team do it, and that's very reasonable to do manually without overtime. And I bet they would put in overtime.",

I’m in talks with a few but one stands out as the type of non-technical cofounder I’m looking for. Domain knowledge, relevant network, sales expertise etc but most importantly I would say we have good chemistry. Also it’s a niche B2B platform, which is +++ for me.\n\nHowever… he has come further along than “0”. He has been working half a year on this full-time. He has:\n\n* MVP almost ready (few weeks out)\n* 5 design partner that are willing to pay once MVP is usable\n* 10+ customers lined up\n\nHe did this by taking on two “Angel investors” who are previous founders that help startups get off the ground. Some sorta very hands-on mini-incubator. They will slowly transition into advisors as needed. 1 technical + 1 sales/GTM and also great people. They have been part time for 5 months. **They got 15% together**\n\nThey are looking for someone to:\n\n* short term take ownership over the technical parts\n* long term be CTO\n\nThey started out looking for a Founding Engineer but also found me via YC. They see value in having someone as committed and dedicated as a cofounder. I’m also not interested in being “just” a founding engineer. \n\nFor the founding engineer, they said they were offering 10% but were willing to go higher for a cofounder type.\n\nSome other factors:\n\n* No investments yet but are looking to take a very small €200-300k soon\n* With investment + early customers, we should be able to have small wages\n* I believe in the potential very much\n\nThey have a solid start but it’s still a long journey. With the level commitment I want to give, I don’t think I would do it for something close to 10%.\n\n**What is a reasonable equity to expect?**",

          "text": "I'll start with my example. I solo built a product for 10 months - my idea, I know the domain, I got the initial paying customers. Yet, when I found a co-founder, I did a 50:50 split. This is after my co-founder suggested a 35/65 split. Still I did 50/50. It's because a) I truly value a co-founder role and b) I know how hard it is to build a company.   \n  \nAs others have indicated, don't give too much weightage to whose idea it is or MVP etc. There is a huge uphill task in front this company and work done so far will be very small compared to what's to come.\n\nIn terms equity, I would look at it from the lens of what the relative value of your contributions v/s other founders. Let's say you take 15% and other founder has 70%, this means for every unit of time that other founder put going forward, they gain 4.6x equity.  Another way to think about it that you'd work for 4.6 months to gain the equity that your co-founder does after 1 month. That's not a co-founder relationship. \n\nMy view is that if truly join as a co-founder then it should be equal/very close to equal equity, even after the progress he has achieved. ",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m honestly stuck and dont know what to do.\n\nI started working 4 moths ago for a company based in Turkey that produces multiple industrial products. My role is to find international customers and generate sales. The problem is… I’m basically starting from zero, with no previous experiences, no training, and no one to guide me.\n\nI’ve been tried everything I know and learned so far:\n\n\\- Sending cold emails after using AI to find my targeted markets\n\n\\- Searching participants in the fairs that are related to our companies producs and email them (almost no replies)  \n\\- Finding and connecting with people on LinkedIn ( they werent interested )\n\n\\- i even tried reaching on other social media platforms. and most importantly i tried to be presistant and sent follow up emails and messages multiple times.\n\nI really don’t know what I’m doing wrong. But it starting to feel like i keep using the wrong strategies over and over again..\n\nThe company started pushing me recently to do something about it, and they are right. but I’m still trying to figure out how to even get my first serious conversation.\n\nfor now I’m supposed to sell different product categories, I’m responsible for selling stainless steel food production machinery and their manufactured confectionery products, as well as industrial systems for gas generation, air treatment, lazer weding machines, and coating/paint application equipments... and in the future it am expected to sell other products too.\n\nHow do I break this cycle and move up to the point where I can actually call myself a salesperson? what am i doing wrong and what do i need to work on to be successful in the field and get past the phase where everything is ignored to finally closing deals?\n\nI really need guidance here.\n\nThank you",

If they see you on LinkedIn, then a technical forum, then maybe a video of your machinery... you look like an authority, not a rando.\n\n7 Hours: They need to consume about 7 hours of your content. Since you sell machinery, maybe post technical videos of the laser welding or gas systems in action. Let them see the quality before you ask for a check.\n\n8 Touches: Interact with them 8 times. Do not just pitch. Comment on their posts, share a solution to a problem they mentioned, or send them a manual they might actually need.\n\nI havent closed a lead yet, but I went from 0 calls to 7 discovery calls just by switching to this.

Legacy B2B software like SAP or old CRMs have UI that looks like an airplane cockpit so being able to just type out a prompt instead of clicking through forty tabs is actual magic. But businesses will not adopt it if the AI just links them to a help article. It has to actually execute the task. It is the exact same reason I use runable for my workflow, I do not want to click through menus I just want the output immediately. If Crow actually executes the prompt by hitting the backend APIs like it claims then it is a massive winner. If it is just a glorified FAQ bot it will churn in a month.

Like push them to write checks? Or give them time?\n\nAlso do you put all these angels in a RUV or you take individual checks and sign SAFE with each of them?\n\nDo angels often write checks before VC leads a round or they tend to commit first but only wire when the round is closed and lead by a VC?\n\nThanks everyone for helping!",

Do you want to commit a ticket?\"\n\nBasically you first want to talk and give time to think. But once you annouce, that you will to close the round, you kinda have to follow through. Otherwise it will never close. There are of course exceptions and some people just raise money continuosly, but I dont know how realistic that would be for most founders.\n\nYou can also use a SAFE instead of a fixed premoney valuation and just include a cap. Ycombinator says, that this is the way to go and maybe it is in the US. I am from Europe and I think priced rounds are more common for Business Angels here.\n\nIn terms of when Business Angels like to participate:  \nA Business Angel usually likes to invest money 1 day before another VC would invest at a higher valuation.",

Solid technical skills, real projects in production, and business exposure from your family. That is more than most students.\n\nIf you want to level up as a founder, here is what I would focus on beyond coding:\n\n1. Learn to pick better problems. A lot of engineers focus on building. Strong founders focus on problem selection. Is the problem painful? Are people already paying to solve it? Are current solutions weak?\n2. Get good at talking to non technical people. Sales, clear communication, and asking the right questions matter a lot. If you cannot explain your product clearly to someone who does not code, it is not ready.\n3. Think about distribution early. Most products do not fail because of bad code. They fail because nobody sees them. Before building, ask yourself how users will find you.\n4. Build emotional durability. The feeling that everyone else is ahead is normal. You are comparing your daily work to someone else's highlight reel. Every strong founder has many failed attempts behind the scenes.\n\nAlso, being outside Silicon Valley is not a major disadvantage anymore. Most valuable conversations happen online now.\n\nYou do not need to be exceptional today.  \nYou need to keep building, keep talking to users, and stay in the game long enough to compound your skills.\n\nThe founders who win are not the ones who looked impressive at twenty one.  \nThey are the ones who did not quit.",

Everything seemed to go well, and the next steps were supposed to be connecting with other employees, co-founders, and moving into a more formal recruitment cycle or a task.\n\nTo add to my point, the conversation wasn't, let's see, or we are in the process of interviewing and we'll let you know. The conversation was, this is great, I like your background and energy and I'll schedule another meeting with them, give you a task some time next week, etc. \n\nOver the past few weeks, I’ve sent follow-ups, thank you notes and a few emails asking for clarity on the process and timeline and haven’t heard back at all.\n\nGenuinely asking YC founders here: is it a common practice to just ghost people you’ve interviewed with or spoken to?

The cap table math quickly becomes a nightmare when figuring out who gets what from remaining assets, especially when stacked liquidation preferences (like 1x participating vs. 1.5x non-participating) collide with a small cash pile.\n\nThe board inevitably demands watertight documentation, meaning checks cannot just be mailed out; legal approval on the distribution waterfall and individual sign-offs are mandatory. This is where the process stalls, investors often \"\"ghost\"\" because they are disappointed and disengaged, making it excruciatingly difficult to get the required signatures for dissolution.\n\nAdding to the chaos is the friction with option holders who never exercised but emotionally feel entitled to a payout. Explaining that unexercised options do not participate in distributions is a brutal conversation that repeats endlessly. It feels like an \"\"unspoken failure tax\"\" where founders are forced to navigate intense legal and interpersonal hurdles without a roadmap, all while trying to close a painful chapter.",

Launch a discounted presale?\n2. E-mail waitlist and paid socials?\n3. Build a shitty off-the-shelf modified tablet, and sell it cheap on second hand sites?\n4. Other ideas?\n\nThanks a lot! :)",

          "text": "Validate the demand by taking your device and doing a Study. Have speech impaired people use it, record their reaction. Do it with 100 people. Use that average and scale it up. \nIf it helps a high percentage of those people and they’re willing and able to pay for one, you can show a little more validation of the idea. \n\nStarting a waitlist helps too",

          "text": "For my product in the beginning just a list of people who think that they would actually use it is validation. X people said they would be interested or X people saw the demo and said it would be helpful. You can have an informal waitlist if you ask if they would want to use the first version. In your case probably seeing how much interest speech-disabled users have is the best validation. Try to get feedback like: this would help me do x better, this would make school easier for me, or learning x.  Try to ask other questions like what other products do you use that are like this/ to help with this. How do u solve the problem currently or navigate it( this will give valuable user input) how much would you pay for something like this etc and try to validate more than just demand like other parts of ur plan",

          "text": "The same as how you validate any products\n\n1) find pain points, as another comment said. You need to prove it works as a business to yourself before it works to others, or you’re just wasting time.\n2) bootstrap a campaign. \n3) launch your campaign on kickstarter. The more money you get the more you know people want it. People speak with their dollars.\n\nAt this point on, you can possibly get funding. It’s up to you depending on how you want to scale and how much equity and oversight you’re willing to deal with.\n\n4) start selling prototypes, shipping out to beta users and influencers who can bring name to your product\n5) get feedback, iterate.\n\n6) if all of these cycles have gone well you should have the money to produce and meet your existing demand by now. If not then that means your business didn’t have the demand it needed, or you weren’t good enough at executing. Either way it means you wouldn’t have succeeded anyways so it’s time to give up and try again\n\n-> taken from the lean startup method\n\nThere really aren’t any shortcuts and there’s no quick way to validate the demand. That’s why being honest with yourself based on initial market feedback from raw interviews or surveys is so important. Also just so you know: circuit design and hardware takes a long time and a lot of money. I built hardware and exited last year and if you’re serious about this then you should be prepared for the launch cycle to take a year or two minimum before you even have a working MVP. \n\nEven the most basic designs have long wait times between finding a viable chip producer, finding viable PCB makers, waiting on fab times, finding manufacturers for your case/shell/glass or any materials you might have, and of course testing between each one to make sure they work.",

          "text": "So why not just make it an app? Apple and Samsung dominate the tablet market. You can't beat their scale – mind you, that an iPad is 319 $.  Your physical product will definitely be less quality or much higher in price, both cases would be devastating in terms of business aspects. \n\nFamilies don't want to buy a second tablet. They already own one. The value your device provided your family was not the vehicle (the tablet) but the value (the communication).\n\nBy insisting on building hardware, you are actively choosing a worse business model with less margins and a smaller total addressable market.",

              "text": "We're not exclusively building an app, because a key difference is that the tablet is purpose-built.\n\nIt's meant to be stationary, there are no apps, we have a bit of external hardware to control it, we need 100 % remote control of it (which general purpose tablets don't offer for good reasons) etc. etc.\n\nAnd, respectfully, I wasn't asking for advice on whether we should handle the hardware or not. I didn't build this myself as a SISP, I built it because there isn't any good options on the market at all, to cover our needs.\n\nWith the limited context, you also can't really determine whether it's a \"worse business model\". iPad or a Samsung tablets wouldn't be an alternative.\n\nWhat I'm asking is inputs on how to validate the demand, before I start a costly production. In our case, it's not an option to launch without a single piece of hardware. The hardware itself, the controls etc. is exactly our product.",
