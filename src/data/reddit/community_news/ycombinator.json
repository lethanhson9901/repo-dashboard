I’m now seriously considering going back to corporate.\n\nHonestly, I feel like I’m going a bit crazy and could use some perspective from other B2B founders.\n\n**Question:**  \nHow long did it take you to go from MVP to your **first paying B2B customer**?\n\nIf you’re open to sharing:\n\n* What you were building\n* Team size\n* Whether you were part-time or full-time\n\nI’d really appreciate it.",

You aren't going crazy, but you are definitely burning the candle at both ends, and probably the middle, too.\n\nThe 'freelancing for more time' move is a classic trap; clients are often more demanding than bosses because you’re always 'on.' If you're feeling this burnt out and haven't landed a B2B client yet, going back to corporate might actually be the smartest move for your startup. It gives you the financial runway to breathe so you aren't making desperate decisions.\n\nB2B is a marathon. Most teams take 6–12 months of full-time focus to get that first check. Doing it part-time while freelancing is playing on 'Extreme' difficulty. Don't feel like a failure for choosing stability while you refine the product, momentum is easier to build when you aren't worried about the rent.",

What you are feeling is normal, but the feedback you are getting (\"You're too early\") is code for something specific.\n\nPart-time Risk  \nIn B2B, enterprise buyers aren't just buying code; they are buying **Support Continuity.**\n\nIf they suspect you have a day job, they view you as a \"Flight Risk.\"  \nThey worry: \"If this breaks on Tuesday morning, are you fixing my issues, or are you stuck in a Zoom meeting with your boss?\"\n\nThis slows down the sales cycle massively because you are fighting Counterparty Risk, not just product fit.\n\nFreelance Trap  \nYou are in a very challenging situation. Building a startup while juggling family commitments is hard enough. Freelancing is often harder than a corporate job.  \n  \n\\- Corporate: You clock 40 hours for a fixed check. You can mentally check out at 6 PM.  \n**-** Freelance: You are constantly hunting for new business. Every hour you spend hunting for a freelance gig is an hour you aren't hunting for B2B leads for your startup. How do you balance this?\n\nB2B Reality  \nB2B Infrastructure/SaaS typically takes 6-9 months of full-time effort to get real traction.  \n\\- 3 months to build trust  \n\\- 3 months to navigate procurement/security.  \n\\- 1 month to sign.\n\nYou can't speed up a B2B sales cycle. If money is an issue, look for a boring, low-stress job that doesn't drain your brain. Save up 6 months of runway, then jump.\n\nThe Venture Grade Question  \nFinally, ask yourself if your business actually requires Venture Capital right now.\n\nIf it is not \"Venture Grade\" (aiming for $100M+ revenue), perhaps pursue it as a disciplined, cashflow-generating business instead. This removes the pressure of investor rejection and gives you time to grow the product while spending quality time with your family.\n\nYou can't cross a chasm in two small jumps. Pick the path that lets you leap.\n\nHope this gives you clarity. All the best.",

We have daily thousands of users active. Daily around 100+ books and users are joining the app. I have reached investors and they end up saying YOUR ARE TOO EARLY or WE NEED MORE USERS etc.\n\nSo it was the idea they are not interested I think. So I decided to go without major investing. Yeah... this is a bad idea but had to do it unless we get more visitors and noticed by others.\n\nHope this will help you...",

          "text": "Quitting a regular job for a freelance job because of your startup is the most stupid thing  I've ever heard. You can't do freelancing and do startups at the same time. A lot of people think freelancing is about controlling your time. Yes! It is! It will control you! You need to manage all the work, and have to manage customers and support tickets all at the same time! There is no break, no holidays, no pto. \n\nOn the other hand, having a fulltime job gives you Security and fall back. The most bullshit advice is to quit your job to chase startups. It's a cool story though IF you ever make it. But you're not doing it for a cool Cinderella story. You're at it because you want financial freedom and to take care of your family first.\n\nAnd building is only half the process. Once you perfected your product, the real grind starts when you start selling and marketing what you've built. Suddenly your in a new territory royally different from what you used to do. If you have no marketing or sales people, the obvious is to do yourselves first until you make enough to sustain hiring.\n\nStartups are brutal. Ive been in the same trap. Built B2B apps no one really cares about. Got some paying customers but not enough to even pay a single household bill. The good thing is I keep my job. If I quit, the only difference is I will finish it faster but the same result.\n\nI'm still hopeful as well but I'm doing differently. Instead of building myself first, I look for partnerships with a strong product and service and offer sales and marketing for a revenue sharing model. I'll treat the product as if I built it myself and my own as a solo founder. If I can't make a single sale, I have no business building my own and hoping I can sell a better product. If I can't sell an established product with existing and paying users, how am I going to sell a New product in the market starting from 0? \n\nIt sounds simple but founder led growth is super hard. Do product led growth first then you can crack founder led growth",

The common pattern wasn’t team size or whether they were full-time... it was how tightly they were talking to a specific buyer and iterating around real conversations.\n\nB2B messes with your head because:  \n\\- Sales cycles are slow  \n\\- Feedback loops are long  \n\\- Investors say “too early” until suddenly you’re “interesting”\n\nIt creates this constant feeling of being stuck in neutral. One thing I’ll say gently: if both founders are stretched thin, you have to be ruthless about leverage. You can’t afford to manually grind everything.\n\nThis is where I’ve seen founders stay sane: use AI aggressively. Let it handle the heavy lifting... landing pages, outbound drafts, pitch deck iterations, product specs, even rough feature builds and UI ideas. You focus on:  \n  \n\\- Talking to customers  \n\\- Refining positioning  \n\\- Closing deals\n\nEverything else can be accelerated. B2B isn’t won by coding more hours. It’s won by sharper feedback loops and tighter positioning.\n\nAlso.. going back to corporate isn’t failure. Burnout decisions are worse than strategic pauses. If your runway (mental + financial) is collapsing, stabilizing isn’t weakness.\n\nYou’re not crazy. You’re in the messy middle. Every serious B2B founder I know has had this exact “am I delusional?” phase. The only real question is: are customers leaning in when you talk to them? If yes, keep going. If not, adjust fast.\n\nHang in there.",

I am an undergraduate student who has done a research position at my university and an internship. I am set to be the CTO. In contrast, my friend (CEO) has a PhD, has worked in industry extensively, and is nearly twice my age. \n\nI personally don’t have issues working with him, and he clearly respects my skills enough that he suggested we do a 50/50 split, but I’m curious if this level of skill imbalance with cause any problems. Another thing reinforcing this is the technology we plan to pursue is derivative directly of his PhD work, and he owns the patent for the work.\n\nI do not have any issues working with him on this technology, as not only is it very interesting, but it’s also in the exact field that I worked on for my research and internship, along with for my art. The plan is for me to do most of the software development while my friend builds the hardware (we’re a hardware company). \n\nWill these imbalances cause any issues and raise red flags when applying?",

YC loves teams where one person has deep domain expertise and the other grinds on building the product. The fact that hes a PhD with a patent and youre the one turning it into working software is a pretty clean founder dynamic.I wouldnt stress the equity split stuff too much, 50/50 is fine if you both feel good about it. What YC cares about way more is whether you can actually ship and whether theres real founder chemistry. Focus your application on traction, what youve built so far, and why you two specifically are the team to pull this off. The \"weak CTO\" framing is in your head, not on paper.",

But the truth is, the counterparty might just be ranting. Not every conversation requires a solution; sometimes it just requires understanding.\n\n1. Startup Sales NOT EQUAL MNC Sales\nBuilding a startup is very different from doing sales at a giant like Microsoft. At Microsoft, you are capturing existing demand. In a startup, the value proposition requires intense scrutiny.\n\nJust because we think it is useful doesn't mean it’s true. But likewise, just because the market says \"we don't need this\" doesn't mean you stop.\n\n- I remember when Internet Banking in the 90s was viewed with disgust by bank CEOs.\n\n- I remember when Java was viewed with deep skepticism by the CTOs of that era.\n\nYou have to see the \"shift in the sand\" before the market does. The early stage isn't about selling to everyone; it's about finding the specific beachhead that allows you to prove the innovation works.\n\n2. Process over Personality\nSales isn't just about being an extrovert. It's a process.\n\n- What objections did I handle well?\n\n- Did I segment the prospect correctly?\n\n- Is the value prop aligned?\n\nThis is an ongoing loop. We actually just build an internal \"AI co-pilot\" just to ensure we stay aligned and consistent when we go to market. It keeps us honest to the process.\n\n3. The \"Trusted Expert\"\nThere are different sales personalities. You have the \"Openers\" (great at cracking doors open), but you also have the \"Trusted Experts\" (technical authority).\nThis is why VCs often prefer teams over solo founders. You can tag-team: one relationship builder, one technical expert.\n\nIf you are a technical founder, don't try to be the \"loud salesperson.\" Be the expert who builds the future. It is part of the business building and personal growth journey.\n\nHope this helps. All the best.",

What kind of problem severity led them down the search until they went with your solution? What converted them from interested into buying customers? What was their expectation/reality fit? How much of what you promised was real and helpful to them? If you have a recurring business structure, what made them stay? Is your customer base happy looking else to compare something similar or are they buy and stay with it customers? \n\nAnd once you get those questions answered, it will help you to define your USP better, which you will then use to create an even better picture (arguments) for prospects, to make their decision easier. Emphasis on the easier. \n\n",

You can start with YC's video on this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH7REvnQ1y4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH7REvnQ1y4)\n\nB2C: This is quite tricky, and there's no one formula.  You can try directly pitching potential customers as if it's a B2B product just to get your first couple dozen users and get some feedback.\n\nOnce you have at least a handful of users who stick around (really stick around, as in 1 or 2 months after signing up, they're using you every day if you're a social app or have purchased every month if you're ecommerce), then you just try lots of things for how to reach people like them.  Whatever you do, don't spend on paid ads until you've solved retention.\n\nAlso, it's a trap I've fallen into myself as a technical founder - you should be forcing yourself to spend at least 50% of your time on acquisition, and maybe more than that, \\*especially\\* now that building is so much faster. If you have no users, you have not spent at least as much time on getting customers as you did building the product, and your instinct is to build more features or pivot into a completely different space, you need to silence that instinct and get to work on acquisition.",

Engineers got Cursor/claude code and went from 10x to 100x. What did PMs get? Claude Projects with manual uploads and Dovetail with a 3-week onboarding.\n\nI'm a PM sitting on 15 unanalyzed user interviews because proper synthesis takes days I don't have. I've tried stitching Claude + NotebookLM + Dovetail together. \n\nConsidering building something for this. But first does it already exist?

I have prompts for certain tasks - like write a prd. I use cursor to attach existing requirements into context and then ask me questions about the new feature. I answer the questions (some times that needs legal or other research) and it writes a good prd tailored to my product vision and with context of existing features.\n2. Test generation. I point cursor to a requirement page and tell it to generate tests (special prompt). The I can test against those.\n3. User Interview  analysis - same thing. Just save as .md and ask what you want\n\nApart from these deliverables pms job is about alignment. Which you can’t replace with ai.\n\nWhat else is missing that we need a new product?",

          "text": "Claude Code is a pretty serviceable tool for this in my experience, and Teresa Torres has written a lot about how to add structure so you're getting consistent results. To me, this is basically building Cursor for PMs yourself using Claude Code as a platform.\n\nTaking the interview synthesis problem for example, you need to build a way to synthesize each transcript, ideally in a way that the opportunities and other insights can be separated out for further analysis. Then you need a way to synthesize the result from each individual interview, and store that in a way that is internally consistent. It's also handy to know where in the customer workflow all this fits so you can judge the relative value of opportunities you find. You're building a simple customer research repository at this point with markdown files. To some degree this can be queried on demand if you do your synthesis in a structured way and break down the md files with some metadata.\n\nThis beats the old way of manual synthesis but the terminal isn't really the ideal UI for a lot of PM use cases that benefit from graph relationship visualization, and you still have to roll your own way to store all the data in a way you can query it later.\n\nHere's what I've been working on to more directly target product use cases, particularly the discovery and validation parts. That's the problem I focused on because tools like Cursor and Claude Code are already nailing the prototyping use cases, especially if the PM has read only access to their app repo and component library.\n\n  \n[https://revelica.com/](https://revelica.com/)\n\n  \nThere's a specific playbook for interview analysis because it's just easier to do these repeatable processes with an agentic workflow instead of an open-ended agent UX.\n\n  \n[https://revelica.com/templates/playbook/interview-snapshot](https://revelica.com/templates/playbook/interview-snapshot)",

          "text": "Founder of Dotted here. Yes, it exists, we've been working on it for several months and have some die-hard early customers. Couple of things:\n\n\n1. Since the dawn of software, execution has always been the bottleneck. Planning and aligning with always took much less time than actually building the code. When vibe coding really hit that reality began to inversed, and it appears to be accelerating. Truly ai native organizations are already experiencing massive bottlenecks at the product layer. ( https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-ng-product-management-bottleneck-coding-ai-startups-2025-8 )\n\n\n2. What's needed is something that can operate the product process at the speed and scale of agentic coding systems. This is in some ways simpler than coding but in other ways much much harder. You know when code works right away, plans not so much. Even if you can figure out what to build next with some magic telemetry+user feedback+crystal ball, in many organizations the real work of the pm is bringing others around to the plan to create alignment so a system is needed to know what is and is not acceptable to do without approval and how to get it from whom when needed. \n\n\n3. Despite what you've been told, not everyone is going to be a vibe coder or agent builder just because ai made it easier. \"X just made it so everyone can code!\" is something people have been saying since the advent of the first compiler and as recently as the no code systems of the 2010's. Most people just don't have a clear idea of what they want or how to express it and even fewer understand or desire a maintenance burden for keeping it working. Databases have had built in guis since forever and saas still exists. Most people still want a product that thoughtfully solves their needs and don't want to take time and focus away from what they are actually doing to build it. PM's put an especially high premium on this for tools they use themselves. \n\n\n4. Everyone is being told \"figure out how to use AI to do your job harder/better/faster/stronger or you're fired\". Many PMs are trying to use cursor or Claude code etc but those tools are just not built for them or, more importantly, for the people they owe deliverables to. (You don't send vp's a GitHub repo full of .md files and say \"skill issue\" when they don't get it.) Babysitting just-capable-enough-to-be-dangerous PM's is creating a huge support burden on engineering teams who are just barely keeping their own heads above the deluge of tooling changes that AI is creating. \n\n\nTLDR: Huge, unbelievable quantities of the work PM's do is just straight up robot work in 2026 but the robots can't do it unsupervised and the parts they can't do are only getting more important with the new uncapped abundance of code. \n\n\nWe at Dotted saw all this coming and already built some of what we think the solution is and some people are really really liking it. \n\n\nBut you don't have to take my word for it! It's free for your first 3 projects with unlimited tokens on all the frontier models. Try it yourself and tell us what you think. \n\n\nhttps://try dotted.com",

It’s about compressing the \"15 interviews -> decisions -> enforceable spec\" loop and making it auditable.\n\nIf anyone here is sitting on a backlog of interviews/notes + a messy stack (Linear/Jira/Notion/PostHog/etc), I’m looking for a few teams to test on real data.

I don’t claim it to be a perfect system but it gets the job done with a few edge case bugs.\n\nThis system works and generated real world data that proves it can work and can uncover massive value within the drug development space.\n\nI have also onboarded 3 global executives of big Pharma companies on the advisory panel. I negotiated with them and got them to trust the product. I have negotiated with a IP law firm to provide us legal counsel for free until such a time we raise. Now, fast forward to past week, I have begun pondering to go for a raise either applying to YC or VCs and reached out to my network who all said I’m ready to go for some kind of raise. I’ve even done an initial call with a VC (Ik it means nothing and still a long way to go)\n\nHowever, given the low % chance I have to get in to YC or the long slog ahead to getting VCs to give me their cash. I want to continue the momentum, however I found myself struggling with the software complexity getting too much and probably need someone who does this stuff on a daily basis.\n\nSo naturally I reached out within my network and have a friend from FAANG-tier who I reached out to who was very enthusiastic with being a CTO and founding. Now, I am not a sucker to equity in all honesty, I don’t care because 100% of nothing is always 0. However he signalled he wanted to have equal share which i understand but for the sake of having a CTO it feels wrong to just sign over 50%. Especially given 90% of all the problems until now I have delivered, and got POC and using my own network so far.\n\nOr am I being a terrible here?\n\nIs it better to raise and then hire a founding engineer or is it better to find a CTO in my situation where the platform is important but I have already identified that it works?",

While you have de-risked the business to some degree, you are far away from your first raise (which should not be treated as a milestone), your first 3–5 customers, and product-market fit. A lot will likely happen during that time, including product, commercial model, or some other kind of pivot. While skills are important, people often forget that a good co-founder helps you navigate those hurdles and shares that weight and responsibility with you.\n\nI can imagine that you would like to retain some additional equity for the work you have put in.

Which resonates with the irrealistic 50% he asks, showing zero real world experience.

          "text": "Been in a very similar spot when I started. Went to school for data science/ML. Entered the marketing/distribution side by force around 5 years ago now. Some tips I find helpful NOW that I learned the hard way:\n\n**1. Pick ONE product and go all in on distribution**\n\nSeems straight forward, but it's a lot easier to ship multiple things when you can spend money to delegate.. otherwise you're spreading yourself thin. \n\nMultiple products means multiple audiences, multiple messaging strategies, multiple funnels.. all competing for your limited time and energy. This doesn't have to be a long process either. You can get something growing in a couple months if you're super intentional.\n\n**2. Get in the room where decisions happen**\n\nYou're in Dubai.. so already a good start. But even if you don't go to in person stuff then start connecting with more people online. Value-trading circles, low cost paid communities, programs, etc.\n\nThat's actually a massive advantage right now. The AI ecosystem there is growing fast and there's real money flowing into enterprise solutions. But you can't access it without connecting with the right people quickly.\n\n**3. Build distribution into the product itself**\n\nThe best AI products right now aren't just tools, they're things people talk about and share because using them makes the user look smart or saves them something obvious. \n\nThink about what would make someone send your tool to a colleague unprompted. If you can't answer that clearly, the product might work fine but it has no built-in growth loop. A good place for inspiration is always the B2C world (like simple viral apps).\n\n**4. Content is the biggest advantage right now (and has been for a few years)**\n\nYou can build production-ready AI in under a week. Most people can't. \n\nYou can share the process. You can share the products. You can share tutorials. You can share literally anything. If the products solve real problems, then consistency should reward you within a few weeks (even if it's a very small reward). \n\n**Bonus: Validate before you build the next one**\n\nThis is the big one. And I say it with love because I've made this exact mistake multiple times.\n\nBefore you write a single line of code on the next idea, get 5 people to tell you they'd pay for it. Not \"that's cool\" or \"yeah I'd probably use that.\" Actual commitment. A waitlist signup, a pre-order, a deposit, something with friction. OR if you're not comfortable doing that yet, leverage direct outreach on LinkedIn or email and at least start having the meetings and conversations during the process.\n\nThe direct outreach paired with a decent amount of content would easily get you in front of a few thousand people meaningfully a week.. once it builds momentum it could rise from there. It's also a lot easier to run and scale ads once you validate angles with organic so that's another perk.",

The fastest path I've seen for technical founders is finding where your target users are already venting about problems, then building exactly what they're asking for. For B2B stuff, Reddit is actually huge for this because enterprise buyers are searching Google for solutions and Reddit threads rank at the top now.\n\nThe challenge is most technical people either can't do the community engagement piece (too slow, sounds promotional) or they get banned trying. Some B2B companies just hire a done-for-you service to handle Reddit engagement for them instead of trying to do it themselves. Community Mentions is one I came across recently that handles the research, posting, and compliance side so you're actually showing up in conversations where peopel are activley looking.\n\nMight be worth exploring since it sounds like you can ship fast but need a distribution channel that doesn't require you to guess what to build next.",

Talk to the handful of people who still use it and over‑index on what they’re doing right before and after they touch your thing.\n\n\\- Treat “contacts of contacts” as a feature not a bug – that’s how most early B2B deals happen anyway. Doubling down there feels less sexy than “scalable distribution,” but it’s usually where the first real traction comes from.\n\nCurious what you’d pick if you had to bet the next 6–12 months on just one of your products?",

If they complain about needing a massive budget or a perfect landing page to start they are just a consultant in disguise and will drain ur equity.

No one likes to work with smarts when they treat you like jerk!\n2- spend quality time to assess whether this skills are truly complementary to yours. \n3-Depending one stage of your businesses, what you need from your marketing cofounder is different. I assume you are in early stage. Here are some “projects” you can ask them to do to assess whether #1 and #2 holds up\n  a)if you have not engaged any customer yet, you might need a strategic leader who helps define ideal customer profile for your product by doing deep customer discovery work on who is willing to pay for solving the pain point that you think your product solves. \n   b)Doing thorough SWOT analysis of your competitors to come back a set of opportunities. You will know when someone is simply GPTing stuff vs knows what they are talking about when they share such analysis\n    c) for B2B products landing 5 business conversations to hear their feedback is a monumental task\n     d)driving awareness takes $$ but you can also do a lot of manual effort (e. Reddit, LinkedIn ) to drive specific outcomes like week over week increase in #trials.  Doing these grassroots non-scalable things will help you test where your customer is hanging out!\n      e) are they able to think through go to market strategy as a whole? What should we charge for our product? Where should we sell the product-why/why not? Should we have 3 package/offer or just one and why? How do we position the product so we are differentiated from the competition? What features should my tech cofounder build so we differentiate from competition? What is our value proposition?\n      f)brainstorm problems that are not related to their area to see how they respond…co founder mindset people will roll up the sleeves to brainstorm even when they don’t know the area!\n\nBy the time you do these small projects you will know whether they are someone you can bank on for the long term.",

Often I'll get a sense if someone is knowledgeable to help within the first 1-2 minutes. The same principle could apply to their application process too. I doubt they'd do it all by hand, but if they had to: 40,000 apps / 20 work days / 8 hours per day / 60 minutes per hour = 4.2 apps per minute. Screen some apps instantly, have a few on the team do it, and that's very reasonable to do manually without overtime. And I bet they would put in overtime.",

Senior people at big companies respect a founder who knows their product inside out and can answer everything on the spot without deferring to someone else.Bringing someone who doesnt really work on the product is risky because if they get asked a direct question and fumble it, thats way worse than just being one person. If you really want another body on the call, make sure they actually know the product cold and can add real value, not just fill a seat.",

Before that, checklists help, but a lightweight pentest is often the most practical middle ground because it gives you actionable fixes and something credible to say you’ve actually tested it.\n\nIf you want an easy option for that, check out StealthNet AI (stealthnet.ai). They offer AI, Hybrid (AI + human), and Manual (human only), so an early team can do a quick prelaunch pentest style engagement, then step up to hybrid/manual later when enterprise and compliance pressure kicks in.",

I’m in talks with a few but one stands out as the type of non-technical cofounder I’m looking for. Domain knowledge, relevant network, sales expertise etc but most importantly I would say we have good chemistry. Also it’s a niche B2B platform, which is +++ for me.\n\nHowever… he has come further along than “0”. He has been working half a year on this full-time. He has:\n\n* MVP almost ready (few weeks out)\n* 5 design partner that are willing to pay once MVP is usable\n* 10+ customers lined up\n\nHe did this by taking on two “Angel investors” who are previous founders that help startups get off the ground. Some sorta very hands-on mini-incubator. They will slowly transition into advisors as needed. 1 technical + 1 sales/GTM and also great people. They have been part time for 5 months. **They got 15% together**\n\nThey are looking for someone to:\n\n* short term take ownership over the technical parts\n* long term be CTO\n\nThey started out looking for a Founding Engineer but also found me via YC. They see value in having someone as committed and dedicated as a cofounder. I’m also not interested in being “just” a founding engineer. \n\nFor the founding engineer, they said they were offering 10% but were willing to go higher for a cofounder type.\n\nSome other factors:\n\n* No investments yet but are looking to take a very small €200-300k soon\n* With investment + early customers, we should be able to have small wages\n* I believe in the potential very much\n\nThey have a solid start but it’s still a long journey. With the level commitment I want to give, I don’t think I would do it for something close to 10%.\n\n**What is a reasonable equity to expect?**",

Early advisory grants are typically in the \\~0.25–1% range, vesting over 1–2 years. The number should reflect leverage, not hours. Someone who makes introductions and shapes outcomes is worth more than someone who gives occasional feedback.\n\nWhen choosing an advisor, I’d optimize for pattern recognition over prestige. You want someone who has seen your stage and your type of problems before. A big name who doesn’t understand your customer is less useful than an operator who’s navigated similar constraints.\n\nEffectiveness mostly comes down to structure. The best relationships feel like lightweight board meetings: clear agenda, written updates, specific asks, and tracked follow-ups. If meetings drift into casual chats, value drops fast.\n\nFrom a criteria standpoint, I’d look for sharp thinking, reliability, and genuine excitement about your problem. Advisors who challenge you productively are far more valuable than those who just validate your decisions.\n\nMost strong advisors come through warm founder intros, angels in your space, or targeted outreach to operators who built something adjacent to what you’re doing. Specific context beats a generic advisor who asks every time.\n\nThe biggest mistake founders make is treating advisors as a badge instead of a working tool. The right advisor should increase clarity and accelerate decisions, not just look good on a slide.",

Legacy B2B software like SAP or old CRMs have UI that looks like an airplane cockpit so being able to just type out a prompt instead of clicking through forty tabs is actual magic. But businesses will not adopt it if the AI just links them to a help article. It has to actually execute the task. It is the exact same reason I use runable for my workflow, I do not want to click through menus I just want the output immediately. If Crow actually executes the prompt by hitting the backend APIs like it claims then it is a massive winner. If it is just a glorified FAQ bot it will churn in a month. People just want to skip the learning curve and get the job done.",

When I showed up at the gym, the activation code didn't work. I wrote an email to their support, but it took them days to reply. I couldn't use the gym, and neither could others. I told them over email that their system sucked. I mentioned I'm a software engineer and if they needed help, they could just reach out and I would help them hook things up.\n\nOne week later, one of the co-founders replied that they might need help. Another week passed and they started asking questions. After about 10 emails, I built them an MVP for a recurring payment processor with PayU (the only payment processor they were able to get a contract from in the region). That fixed their initial problem, but it took us 6 months to integrate with the door-locking company, which was from Sweden.\n\nThe initial product was full of bugs; it was an insane amount of work doing it alone (this was pre-AI). One day, I woke up to hundreds of emails from the gym's customers complaining because the system had double-charged everyone. It didn't have proper reporting, and the founders chased me for months to build it. They used my system regardless of it having the clunkiest UI ever, lacking basic features, so it still required an insane amount of manual work for them, but it worked and allowed their business to grow. It was better than anything else they could get at the time.\n\nThe system I built processed over $500,000 and allowed them to open multiple locations in the city and expand to other countries. \n\nAlternatives costed about $70-90/mo, but they lacked the specific integrations they needed, so I was able to charge $250-$500/mo (they payed quarterly though).

I thought high-end UI was a defensible moat in 2026. Now I'm wondering if enterprise buyers actually *trust* boring, Excel-like interfaces more because they signal \"utility\" over \"style\".\n\n**The Question for other founders here:** Have you experienced this \"Penalty for Creativity\" in B2B?
