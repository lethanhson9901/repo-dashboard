Just look around every man and their dog can become founders. And is a tonne of people building a bunch of apps for purposes I know has not been properly thought out. The majority of the apps I come across straight up going to be not worth the effort it takes to build it.\n\nThis might be harsh feedback, but take it as an honest advice from a stranger. Until you have an idea, and I mean a really strong idea that you can envision how it plays out and what the execution it requires before you even start building, it might be better worth your time to do something outside of the start-up scene. This space is often glorified for it successes and rarely for the many more failures I would imagine.\n\nI’m new to the scene, so I don’t know a whole lot. But I’ve also been in the real world, and maybe given my previous experience too, can tell what will work and what wouldn’t. Having had to be a good judge of character too, the ones that will push their stuff through, won’t be on reddit hoping for salvation. They would be too busy hacking away. \n\nFor myself, as a solo founder, I’ve build my thing, got my product in the market already, and have paying customers. I’m about to turn up the focus on accelerating the customer growth lever in February. This was all done in 14 months on my own, self funded. And the only reason why I may have been able to get here is due to my experience previously + a clear idea on what needs to be done. All before I had even started building the product. \n\nYes pivoting is crucial in start up to adapt to your environment, but not a whole revamp. That’s just goes to show something wasn’t right to begin with. \n\nMy 2c.",

This might sound silly but should we really risk revealing our idea, plan, and pitch deck to an angel who will get to see the problem statement and solution that we want to develop. How do we mitigate this, we will learn about IP and idea protection, pitch deck preparation and tips on what not to reveal only during our incubation. \n\nAlso, do you recommend joining an incubator is better than a VC accelerator program that are meant for idea stage startups (Example Accel -Atom , Peak XV -Surge, 100X VC - HomeRun Masterclass Series), because  incubator may take only 3-5% equity but it's followed by Angel or VC pre-seed round of 9-15% equity, so total between 12-20% equity for 1Cr-10Cr. \n\nWe may save 3-5% equity, by directly heading to an accelerator insted of incubator. \n\nWill appreciate your response and opinion.",

But they're not geniuses. They just figured it out as they went. [...] In reality, they struck on something and held on for dear life as it started to get its own legs. \"\n\nThat is, they tapped a well of pent-up demand.

          "text": "Obsession is mostly a retrospective story we tell after something works. It sounds clean and heroic, but it confuses cause with consequence. What actually builds ambitious companies is not obsession. It is clarity plus incentives plus feedback that compound over time. Obsession often shows up later as a visible symptom, not as the engine.\n\nIn the early stages, what looks like obsession is usually asymmetric information. Founders know something others don’t yet. That creates conviction. Conviction creates focus. From the outside, that focus gets labeled obsession. But the underlying driver is not emotional intensity. It is informational advantage combined with belief that the advantage can be converted into outcomes.\n\nObsession without execution quality is useless. Many obsessed founders ship nothing meaningful. They romanticise the problem, over-identify with the idea, and become blind to signals. Obsession actually becomes dangerous when it overrides feedback loops. You stop listening. You start defending. You confuse persistence with progress. That is how companies burn years on the wrong thing.\n\nWhat matters far more is the structure around the founder. Tight feedback loops. Clear metrics. Skin in the game that rewards long-term value, not short-term validation. The ability to revise beliefs without losing identity. None of these require obsession. They require discipline.\n\nThe best ambitious companies are not built by founders who are constantly emotionally charged. They are built by founders who can sustain focus for a long time without burning out, who can make boring decisions repeatedly, and who can delay gratification while staying rational. That looks unsexy. So we call it obsession instead.\n\nObsession is overrated because it is easy to mythologise and hard to replicate. Execution quality is boring but transferable. Incentive design is boring but powerful. Feedback loops are boring but decisive. These are the real multipliers.\n\nIn practice, obsession helps at the margins. It can push someone through temporary uncertainty or social resistance. But it is not the core driver. The core driver is sustained alignment between belief, evidence, and reward.",

You need this obsession when building an ambitious company because there will be a million things that challenge you along the way, and the people that don’t have that would give up. \n\nThe financial struggles, giving up conventional paths, arguing with family, having to explain your decision to everyone, all of the people who tell you to just get a real job, the people who don’t get your idea, the people who tell you to “just bring it to your competitor”, the people who say it’ll take too much time and money.

Being accountable to yourself, and not letting things like procrastination, doubt, fatigue, and even minor bouts of emotional ill-equilibrium derail you... requires that *extra thing*.\n\nThat *extra thing* manifests for each person as a subset (or, maybe, a superset) of their own personality and mental/emotional capabilities. For some it's obsession, for others it's a profound lack of limiting beliefs, at least operationally. For others it's all of the above problems but strong resiliency anyway.\n\nThere isn't a single universal *thing*. It's the best of your individual potential. You can't be someone else, but you can be the optimal you. Figure that out and nurture it and act from it. Seeing the truth of your efforts, and what keeps you from doing something every day, is also a superpower.

A professor at a state university has been testing it and wants to use it in his class this semester (about 30 students, 6-8 weeks).\n\nThe catch: they can't pay anything now. His pitch is that if the pilot goes well, he'll push for department adoption, then university-wide, then potentially the entire state university system. Says they could set up a lab fee to cover costs by 2027.\n\nMy hesitation:\n\n\\- He's already using the product and clearly sees value, but won't find even a few hundred dollars to cover compute costs\n\n\\- The timeline to any actual revenue is 2+ years of \"maybes\"\n\n\\- He wants me to prioritize building a specific feature for his use case by end of February\n\n\\- I'm currently in active conversations with paying customers in my actual target market\n\nPart of me thinks there's long-term strategic value here. Part of me thinks this is a classic trap where I subsidize someone's usage forever while chasing a contract that never materializes.\n\nMy gut says: if they saw real value, they'd find the money. The elaborate vision for the future feels like a substitute for present commitment.\n\nAm I being short-sighted? Or is this just a distraction from closing real customers?\n\n",

It's all verbage in business. \n\n  \nContact some other universities and put together a small demo or trial for it. That will actually give you a good idea of the market. We took HSMN, our architecture, and split it off into computational chemistry sim and ran into the same issues. Everyone in that market wants to use it for free effectively, and always with the promise of being paid. There's even a whole platform dedicated to those types of contracts, and it always reminds me of the Tesla and Edison with the promise of $50k to Tesla if he completed a project, of which he was never paid. Those contracts all feel eerily similar to that, they attempt to put your work beneath what they're doing in order to control it. \n\n  \nIf you're self funding, just build the features out yourself.

          "text": "There's a dance to early enterprise sales that's pretty opaque to outsiders. It sounds like you've been buyer-side several times so maybe you're already familiar with it, but fwiw...\n\n1. The classic advice (per _Crossing the Chasm_) is to find a genuine early adopter who likes trying out new stuff. They will understand your tech is early, but the tradeoff is the 10x gain they get despite the pain (bugs, support, etc). Think about someone who speaks at (or attends) meetups for e.g., and wants something cool to show their peers. You can also just ask them if they're an early adopter!\n2. That 10x benefit might help the enterprise in some broader way, but in sales (per Gartner) business value is table stakes and personal value is king. So think about how your product can help them directly and/or make them look better on their next performance review, or on LI, or at the next meetup for e.g., and roll that into your hook if you can. \n3. Obviously, almost no enterprise gets a pitch for an MVP product and takes it as is. But that doesn't mean they're uninterested in early tech. This is where the enterprise sales dance really starts, and the magic term here is \"design partner.\" I.e., you're not looking for a sale, you're looking for a design partner to help you build towards true PMF. This needs to be handled carefully so you protect your IP (if you product is compelling but simple, it can be cloned), but there's a playbook for it, and the right buyers understand how it works.\n\nDM me and I'll send you a playbook from another founder if you like (can't link to it directly because it's from a closed community), but either way, all the best with it :)",

But most teams burn weeks before they even get there - hunting, screening noise, waiting on agencies. That's the part that kills momentum, not being thorough with good candidates.\n\nThat's what we're building, actually. Came out of this exact frustration - teams are getting to first interviews with strong candidates in days, not weeks.",

The symptoms are many: slow sales cycles, high churn, low win rates, but they all have the same root cause: the startup is working on a problem that is not important enough to the segment of customers they are selling to. Until you fix that, the rest doesn't matter.\n\n\\- But, yes, founders who reach PMF and have a chance to grow their companies will tell you that hiring and keeping great people is their biggest challenge. And it's not just hiring engineers - it's hiring any key position. The most challenging hires at many of my startups were in marketing, design, or sales. All hiring is hard.\n\n\\- In general, hire slow/fire fast is still the right advice. No matter how well you hire, a certain % of your hires will be mistakes (20-40% most likely), so the skill to move those people out is almost as important as bringing people in. It's amazing the mental gymnastics many founders will go through to avoid making these hard people decisions. I've seen founders let their companies fail after years of work and millions of investment because they weren't willing to have a five minute conversation to let someone go.",

Good early engineers usually want ownership and influence, not a job spec funded by a deck. Your domain experience is valuable, but you still need to show you can make product decisions and work tightly with someone technical day to day. I have seen this work when the founder already has customers lined up or very clear distribution, not just an idea. Funding without a technical partner is possible, but it is harder and often leads to rushed CTO hires later. I would spend time finding a builder who actually cares about insurance pain, even if that takes longer than raising.",

The real question is what gaps you personally have and how critical they are right now.\n\nA co-founder is not just “help” or someone from your social circle. It’s a long-term commitment, usually 4–5 years, shared responsibility, equity, legal structure, and aligned risk. If you don’t clearly know what role you need filled (tech, business, sales, ops), searching for a co-founder can actually slow you down.\n\nDepending on your stage, alternatives can make more sense:\n\na strong tech lead or contractor\na small outsourced team\nadvisors or mentors\nfocusing on traction and validation first\n\nInvestors (angels or VCs) usually care more about clarity than team size early on. Clear strengths, clear gaps, market validation, roadmap, and numbers matter more than just having a co-founder title attached.\n\nIf you’re open to it, sharing more context about what you’re building and what you personally want to own long-term would make it easier to give more concrete advice.",

My dream is to start a tech startup eventually, but relocating is my first priority due to limited opportunities here.\n\nShould I play it super safe and avoid any risks until I'm settled overseas? Or should I dip my toes in online startup stuff which might delay my move if I won't achieve success?\n\nRight now, time is extremely scarce for me. I could use it to maximize my GPA or spend some time on side startup experiments.\n\nAny advice from folks who've been in similar shoes? Thanks!",

Think of a problem YOU have that's bothering you, perhaps something related to your studies or personal life. Something small and isolated that doesn't need months of development to solve. \n\nSolve it. Don't spend more than a month or two on it. It shouldn't be \"clean\" or \"well-architected\", but it should WORK.  It should solve a problem. Then find another few things and solve those, learning from past mistakes. \n\nDon't make it a priority, but focus on your studies - you will need them. \n\nBut you need to learn how to solve real problems and complete real projects - studies aren't the best at it.\n\nYou have plenty of time. Don't rush.",

When I was 23, I managed to move abroad and worked pretty hard for 7 years. Now I’m 30, I’m trying to build my startup. It is easier when you don’t have visa problems (already a resident) and have a cushion (meanwhile I also got married and having the right partner also makes things easier, before that I felt much more worried about finances that made me to not try to build a startup). No wonder why the average age of startup founders is actually in the 30’s.\n\nThat being said, the reality for tech was quite different 7 years ago, and it was easier than today to find a job overseas. So maybe you should have a plan B in case the plan A doesn’t work.",

Get the grades, make the move, get the job, get established, and then in whatever community you land in start thinking about what startups opportunities look like. That solid foundation will give you far more flexibility to experiment with side projects or startups in the long run, with plenty of opportunity to fall back on if it doesn't work out.

What matters is building skills, taste, and proof of execution that travels with you. Side projects that teach you how to ship, work with users, or earn a dollar online are low risk and high leverage. Betting your relocation on a startup working out is a very different risk profile. Optimize for optionality first. Once you are in a stronger position geographically and financially, startup risk becomes a choice instead of a constraint.",
