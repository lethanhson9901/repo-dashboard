      "text": "Hey there,\n\n  \nI'm Quang, the co-founder of [Vybe](https://www.vybe.build) (YC X25). Previously, I was also the cofounder of Birdly (YC W16). I'm reflecting on how YC has evolved in 10 years, what remains the same and what changed.\n\n**What remains the same:** \n\n1. The core principles remain the same: Talk to users, code, and grow a steady percent every week (5-10%) \n\n2. Weekly dinners to get inspired: \"They've been in your shoes, look at where they are now\". The structure is always the same: it's about 10-12 weeks. Every week you have a dinner with a prominent speaker, for example the founder of Airbnb, or the founder of Stripe, or the founder of Cursor. In our current batch, \n\n3. Group office hours with peers: \"Everyone is struggling with the same things, don't worry\": A group of 8 to 10 startups meeting for 1h30-2h every other week where you discuss your struggles, get advice from others, set up goals for the next two weeks, and create accountability partners. It reminds you that everyone is struggling, so don't worry too much about it. \n\n4. Individual office hours: \"Let's deep dive on what's the #1 thing that prevents you from growing faster\": This is a meeting with your group partner, who funded you, believes in you, and has the most context on you. Every week can be a different topic, but same question: What is the one thing that prevents you from growing faster? \n\n5. Demo day is still the anchor date to create urgency: \"We'll be meeting with 1,000+ investors in a few weeks, if you want to get in, get in now\": that creates a sense of urgency to close customers and meet investors.\n\n\n\n**What changed:** \n\n1. San Francisco is way more vibrant than Mountain View :) \n\n2. Growth Expectations are way higher now. There is more budget for AI tools. It used to be that 12% growth week over week was top batch, now it's the average of the batch!\n\n3. But also, YC has way more reach among potential customers, so any tweet or LinkedIn post to announce your launch will bring you at least 50 to a few hundred sign-ups that all could become customers. \n\n4. YC has way more reach among investors, so the number of inbounds we get is probably 10-20x higher than 10 years ago. Of course, it is a different company, and I'm a different person and there are more investors. But I also heard from batch mates that don't have my pedigree that they also received a lot of inbound just becaue they're from YC\n\n5. A corollary is that YC really really emphasizes that you don't meet investors before you're ready, and the more you wait the stronger your startup will be. They actually recommend not talking to investors before \\~10 days before the demo day. \n\n6. For top startups of the batch (top 25%), there is way less emphasis on Demo Day prep, but rather on the \\~10 days before demo day to meet investors. For top quartile startups, they will have raised before demo day. \n\n  \n",

      "text": "I'm Agree Ahmed, cofounder of [Flowglad](https://flowglad.com/), an open-source payments provider that handles the entire entire job to be done without any glue code. My entrepreneurial journey started when my coworker and I decided to quite our jobs at a San Francisco fintech and book one way plane tickets to Kenya to start a startup there. Before we had given notice at work, we had already secured one of the first ever permits issued by the Kenyan Central Bank to start a fintech there. We built for a few years there, eventually launching an on-demand grocery app that was the largest in East Africa in 2019. I then started [NUMI.tech](http://NUMI.tech) with the same cofounder. It was a design agency that scaled to $2m annualized revenue on its own balance sheet. We promoted a CEO from within the company to run it so we could focus on Flowglad.\n\nBased on my experiences, here's what I've learned you need to go far in a startup:\n\n1.  Genuine passion in the space. Otherwise you will burn out because startups take a while to make significant revenue, and until then the money won't be able to drive you. I've heard of 2 YC cofounders pivot during a batch, but the sales cofounder didn't love the space and therefore didn't put in the effort to sell the product. You can't sell what you don't love. They closed shop soon after the batch.\n    \n2.  An unfair advantage. This can be your network, a network you have easy access to in the space (through a close friend or family member), or domain expertise that gives you an unique insight most others do not. I have one friend in energy who recently closed his startup despite loving the space. The space was ripe for innovation, but he had no past background in it and was solo. 2 of his competitors were startups with 2 industry cofounders each, who ironically all came from the same company before they left to do a startup. He knew he couldn't compete with their networks. A network takes a long time to create.\n    \n3.  The space must be very early or rapidly growing. Look for spaces where demand for a product is greater than its supply. LLMs maturing in the past 3y are a great example of this as many uses are now possible that weren't before. And a slew of startups popped up as a result. A friend of mine made AI receptionists for medspas last year, and he grew like gangbusteres because AI solved last mile issues for his customers. Being early is also great because there's a lot of uncaptured market share up for grabs.\n    \n\nSo what advantage do my cofounder and I have? Well we've spent the last 7 years building businesses with high variable costs. Every single business we've built has had a complex cross border flows of funds. We had to learn how to price in risk, and make commerce seamless--whether it was shipping eggs and carrots down the street in Nairobi or connecting startups and designers from across the world. We've had to build robust systems of record to map feature access to customer billing state. While it sounded extreme while we were doing it, it's pretty common now: people want to sell borderlessly online. And they want to integrate complex pricing models quickly. We knew from our firsthand experience just how much better the tooling could be.\n\n# The long story about our unfair advantage\n\nTo detail our backstory, Harrison and I worked on mobile payments back in 2019 Kenya. At the time we were running what was, that year, the largest on demand grocer in East Africa. This was before the growth-at-all-cost blitzscalers came in and burned tens of millions on the category. Our payments ran on M-Pesa: a mammoth payment network run by Kenyan telco Safaricom. The majority of the adult population of Kenya are on M-Pesa, and its adoption lifted something like 1 million people out of poverty. It is without exaggeration one of the most staggering accomplishments of human ingenuity in the last 50 years.\n\nM-Pesa launched in 2007 and allowed residents to top up mobile minutes on their SIM cards by visiting a participating convenience store. There are 250k (!) such shops in Kenya, about 1 for every 1,000 people. The same flows used to change cash into minutes could change cash into mobile money. And the same accounting systems built to maintain a massive ledger of pay-go plans could now maintain a ledger of mobile money wallets.\n\nIn 2018, M-Pesa’s developer team opened beta access for a new API to issue payment requests to customers programmatically. Called STK Push, it allowed merchants to initiate a request to pop open the M-Pesa USSD confirmation screen on a customer’s phone. It was Kenya’s answer to the 3DS flow that European credit card users know so well.\n\nWe were proudly one of the first production deployments of STK Push. When we launched, most of our competitors hadn’t even implemented STK Push yet in their native checkout flows. Their wisdom and restraint - holding off on adopting unproven infrastructure - was the opposite of our boundless, earnest naivety.\n\nAs an early adopter, we had a front row seat to watch the proverbial cement dry. My friends and I invoke “cement drying” as a reference to the opening of Disneyland, where Disney was building so maniacally to the last minute that it had to bring in helicopters to dry the cement, still wet, as the first guests streamed into the park.\n\nFor most of my founder life I've always something better. Now we're bringing our hard-earned lessons about building payments infra to Flowglad. Our expertise allows us to offer the same delightful DX we created for ourselves in Kenya, to other founders and companies integrating payments in their products.\n\nCombine this with a relentless focus on customers, where Stripe has slipped. You can hop on a call with me or my cofounder anytime.\n\nThis is our unfair advantage. Stripe pioneered payments infrastructure, but now it's time for someone else to lead the future of payments.\n\nIf you're curious, here's a [longer version](https://substack.com/home/post/p-141100596) of our time in Kenya.

I'm almost certain I had nothing to do with it.

I told countless people these ideas.\n\nSome people thought they were interesting, but ultimately no one really cared beyond a conversation. Very few people have the level of agency and motivation to build even their own most deeply cherished ideas. ~No one has the agency and motivation to build an idea that is just randomly given to them. Even if they agree it's a good idea, if they cared enough about the problem to build a business, they would have already thought about the space and arrived at the idea. Building a business requires that kind of obsession. \n\nThen when building my current business, I talked about the idea constantly for months completely openly, and I met three different people who were already working on the same idea, even though there are no existing public products for it. I picked one to work with.\n\nWe will beat the other ones because we care more, work harder, learn faster, and understand the underlying problem space better. The idea is a commodity.",

          "text": "As an advisor and technical cofounder I am often asked to sign NDAs. While I appreciate the intent, it's not practical for people in the industry to sign an NDA just to have a conversation. After a year of signing NDAs I pretty much wouldn't be able to advise anymore because everyone would be considered a competitor.\n\nHowever, there are times where it makes sense to protect information. Here's my general strategy for what it's worth:\n\n**Patents**  \n If a startup has a patentable concept/invention then there's something to protect, if not then generally speaking don't bother. Keep in mind that legally a patent protects an idea by **publicly disclosing it**. So, if you plan on patenting and idea I would use an NDA until the patent is filed - otherwise don't bother.\n\n**Implementation Specifics**  \nYou can generally discuss an idea without going into too much detail about \"how\". I like to use the analogy here of a restaurants \"secret sauce\". Everyone basically knows what's in a restaurants sauce, but they still can't quite reproduce it because there are details left out. Feel free to withhold some details if you don't feel comfortable - there are always key pieces that simply don't have to be explained until later.\n\n**Brevity**   \nIn general, don't offer more detail than is needed for the current conversation. This is not only to protect your advantages, but will go far with people that value their time. For example, if I were working with a startup that had LOIs I wouldn't share any of name of any customers because it's not important. You can say, \"I have a fortune 100 company with a signed LOI\" - don't have to give a name. Individual customers can actually be poached.\n\n**Gut**  \nAt the end of the day, trust your gut. If you are speaking to someone that you think has great intentions and is earnestly offering to help - maybe you offer more info than usual. If the opposite is true then wall-up, smile, and get out. Trust is reciprocal, so be sure that you don't just end up working with people that don't trust you because you couldn't trust them.",

Data is not enough of a moat because no one really has proprietary data anymore. Unless it's heavily science based (ours wasnt), your competitors + foundation models can get the same data that you have.\n\nIf models are adding integrations that directly compete with the workflows you've built your company around, then the workflow wasn't defensible to begin with. \n\nWhat saved our fundraise was when we showed our real moat: vertical integration. Im not gonna say what my startup is and will abstract it as much as I can so you imagine it applying to you. But basically, we added 1 feature and 1 constraint to the product. The new main feature was simply data enrichment. We integrated first with Clay so our clients can enrich the data of their own clients. The constraint is that we made it impossible to export the enriched data + data we capture through usage to their CRM.\n\nSo what happened? We saw clients starting to use us as their CRM too. That's the moat.\n\nOther companies can do it too but that's just normal competition. Vertical integration is what will be our moat against foundational models.",

I pretty much just took the TikTok shop GMV Max algorithm and made it deployable for Facebook ads, adding autonomous capabilities and an AI “brain” that combines the top 5LLM’s for an extra layer of intelligence.\n\nSo ideally people who are already running Meta ads or want to start running Meta ads for something.\n\nIt’s usually $150 a month but for these first test users I’ll manually upgrade you for free so you can use it and test and give feedback.\n\nLet me know if you’re interested",

Currently I have 1 good customer and my point of contact are fin/ops professionals. I had to talk very breifelly with the tech guy in the very beginning. I'm trying to exapand more aggressively now but still unsure if the way is really to target only business professionals. So I'm trying both to check for response rates. How would you send the very first message?  \n\\- What my only client is benefiting(name dropping the client rsrs)?   \n\\- Some results?  \n\\- Simply stating the pain that I solve?   \n\\- Recent market trends that imply the benefit of my product in their organization?\n\nI don't want to automate this task cuz the text is generic and everyone can notice that. Is it a good way to focus on a daily 30 very high quality messages in LinkedIn? I'll also keep track of their emails with Apollo and close the circle with other contact informations from there. \n\nThanks in advance!",

It's the difference between a painkiller and a vitamin - the first solves for an actual pain point, the latter is more of a 'nice to have'. The REAL problem with vitamins is that they often require a more substantial change management that can often turn into a serious hurdle, which leads to churn.\n\nI'd suggest circling back with the interviews you've done with a different set of questions, centered around \"why\" they haven't looked into options for a fix, and whether they're serious about doing anything about it. Don't talk to them about your fix, dig into why they're saying it's a problem and what they should be doing instead. It may turn out that you're focusing on the wrong thing. \n\nThen again, it may reinforce what you're thinking too!",
