      "text": "\n\n\n\nIdeally, along with discovering new medicines, materials and processes, and boosting economic productivity, most of us hope that AI will bring our world closer together. The theory behind this is simple. When resources are abundant, nations stop fighting over them. When people have more than they need, they stop fighting other people over what they don't have. \n\nBut Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, is actively promoting a different vision. He is pushing an \"entente\" strategy where democratic nations use advanced AI systems in military applications to achieve  decisive dominance over everyone else. In other words, he is trying to start an AI military arms race where a group of select \"democratic\" countries have unrivaled dictatorial control.\n\nThe main flaw in this dangerous initiative is that he doesn't understand the difference between what democracy sounds like on paper and how democracy is practiced in the real world. Let's take the US as an example. Ostensibly we are a democracy, but our politics tell a much different story. \n\nIn the 2024 election cycle, total spending reached an estimated $15.9 billion. A small \"donor class\"of 100 wealthy families contributed a staggering $2.6 billion during that cycle. This concentration of funding allows affluent individuals to essentially decide what happens in elections. Here's more evidence.\n\nOver 65% of funding for federal races now comes from PACs and large donors. Studies show that when the preferences of the bottom 90% of earners are different than those of the economic elite, the elite’s preferences are roughly twice as likely to be enacted into law. \n\nSo when the US does virtually nothing to fight climate change, when the\ntop 10% of earners capture approximately 45% to 50% of all of the national income, when we elect a megalomaniac president who wants to annex Canada, invade Greenland, and basically install himself as the dictator of the world, it doesn't take advanced AI to figure out how this all happened.\n\nThe problem with American democracy, which is functionally a plutocracy, is that the money that controls the American government is working on behalf of a very small group of rich stakeholders. In other words, its main concern is neither the welfare of the country nor the welfare of the world. Its main concern is increasing the profits of the people whose money already almost completely controls the entire political system.\n\nSo when Amadei talks about democracy ruling the world, what he really means is the ultra-rich in control of everything. When he refers to non-Democratic countries, he's primarily referring to China. Yes, China's government is no more democratic than ours. But there's a major difference. The Chinese government works for the benefit of the Chinese people, not for the benefit of the Chinese elite. Not only has China lifted 800 million of its citizens from poverty within a time frame that makes the rest of the world green with envy, it is aggressively pursuing a policy to lift the rest of the world from poverty. \n\nNow contrast this with Trump's \"America First\" doctrine where it doesn't matter how poor and powerless our economic programs make other countries as long as America, more specifically America's rich class, comes out on top.\n\nAmodei is THE poster boy for why some of us are afraid of AI going dangerously wrong. His academic training is in biophysics, specifically in electrophysiology of neural circuits. No training in political science. No training in economics. No training in international affairs. He arrogantly believes that being the CEO of an AI company endows him with the knowledge and wisdom to know what's best for the world. But his current project to promote a global AI military arms race where every country competes for hegemonic dominance shows not only how misguided, but also how threatening, he is.\n\nI'm not echoing a minority opinion. Here is how others have been reacting to Amodei's dystopian dream. \n\nYann LeCun:\n\n\"Altman, Hassabis, and Amodei are the ones doing massive corporate lobbying at the moment... [Amodei] could be suffering from a huge superiority complex, believing only he is enlightened enough to have access to AI, but the unwashed masses are too stupid or immoral to use such a powerful tool.\"\n\nMarc Andreessen, in a critique of the \"doomer\" philosophy shared by Amodei, stated: \"Restricting AI is like restricting math, software, and chips... the idea that we should prevent the development of a technology that could save lives because of a 'cult-like' obsession with imaginary risks is a recipe for a new form of totalitarianism.\"\n\nDavid Sacks responded to Anthropic's policy positions by stating that the company has been pushing a \"sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering\" to protect its market position under the guise of safety.\n\nIt would be unquestionably in the best interest of the AI space and the rest of the world if Amodei would limit himself to building coding AI, and leave the engineering of a new global order to people who actually understand the geopolitics and economics of the world.\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n\nOpenAI may be the new Enron. There has been a huge price surge in DRAM kits, and consumer groups are accusing them of intentionally buying up the supply to disadvantage competitors. Market data from TrendForce and IDC confirms a 40–70% increase in consumer PC memory costs throughout 2025. The data provides clear evidence of the \"consumer harm\" to non-AI buyers like gamers, students, and businesses that judges look for in antitrust cases.\n\nClass action suits may come from the millions of people seeing the prices of laptops, phones, and PC parts spike. The suits would claim that OpenAI’s deals with Samsung and SK Hynix created an artificial shortage for the general public. If they can show that OpenAI bought up raw materials just to keep them away from others, this qualifies as \"predatory bidding\" or \"hoarding,\" and violates consumer protection laws in many states.\n\nFederally, the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act allow consumer groups to sue for \"exclusionary conduct\" by hoarding a critical resource to starve out competition. The charge is that OpenAI secured nearly 40% of the global DRAM supply in violation of fair competition laws.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation and other open-source AI collectives are pursuing legal remedies like invoking \"Essential Facilities.\" The argument is that because they control the physical memory needed for modern AI, that memory qualifies as a public utility that OpenAI should therefore be forced to share. Also, The Social Media Victims Law Center has already filed seven major lawsuits alleging that OpenAI's rush to market has led to defective and dangerous products.\n\nOther legal actions involve petitions to federal agencies. In late 2025, several open-source advocacy groups filed formal Amicus briefs and petitions with the Federal Trade Commission. They are asking it to declare AI hardware capacity an \"essential input,\" which allows the government to break up OpenAI’s exclusive supply contracts. The FTC is currently investigating whether OpenAI’s exclusive supply deals violate the \"Unfair Methods of Competition\" rule. It and the European Commission could be OpenAI's most damaging legal adversaries. \n\nAlso, the DOJ is looking into accusations that the \"Stargate\" project functions as a \"monopsony\" where one buyer has so much power it can dictate terms to suppliers and crush rivals. What puts OpenAI at greater legal risk is that they hold a dominant market share, and the law forbids them from using bully tactics that smaller companies might get away with. Using wealth to build a hardware moat is a classic trigger for federal and private legal intervention.\n\nAnd if it loses just some of the claims that Musk is alleging in his lawsuit, (even while winning others) it becomes far more vulnerable to these other suits. 2026 is shaping up to be the make it or break it year for OpenAI.\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nOpenAI wants you to believe that they are too important to the AI space and to the world to be allowed to fail. They have conjured what they hope will be a self-fulfilling prophecy intended to have American taxpayers bail them out if they do not meet their debt obligations. The threat is so real that yesterday Senator Warren sent Altman a letter demanding assurances that they would NOT seek a government bailout if they ultimately failed to turn a profit.\n\nhttps://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-presses-openai-ceo-on-spending-commitments-and-bailout-requests-after-cfo-suggests-government-backstop\n\nAnd the facts and figures don't substantiate any kind of rescue narrative.\n\nLet's first understand why OpenAI is no longer necessary to the AI space today. When they launched ChatGPT-3.5 in November 2022, one might have said that back then they were extremely helpful to attracting hundreds of billions of dollars to the AI space over the subsequent years. But that happened over 3 years ago. Both introducing AI to the world and creating a huge demand for investment in the space are tasks that have already been accomplished.\n\nIf they were to cease to exist tomorrow, there would be no great AI bubble burst. The $1.4 trillion, (and counting) in investment commitments that they pulled together would simply move to their competitors. If Google, Anthropic, xAI and a rapidly growing number of Chinese open source and proprietary AI developers didn't exist, this might not be the case. But they do, and there's nothing that OpenAI has done that these other AI developers cannot already do as well, and often at a fraction of the cost.\n\nNow let's turn to OpenAI's financials. They boast over 900 million weekly ChatGPT users. But only 5% are paid subscribers. Worse yet, their paid subscriptions plateaued in June of 2025. The problem for OpenAI is that 55 to 60% of their revenue comes from ChatGPT. And despite having earned $20 billion in revenue in 2025, OpenAI's expenses that year exceeded $29 billion. Now also keep in mind that their competitors' models are already on par with or surpass GPT 5.2 on the AI benchmarks most important to both consumer and enterprise markets.\n\nLet's consider what they must do to meet their debt obligations. Altman set a target for OpenAI to exceed $100 billion in annual revenue by 2027. But because they are currently earning only $20 billion they would need to increase that income by at least 5x just to meet debt obligations that come due in 2027. And keep in mind that they set this revenue target at a time when the healthcare and other AI products they must sell to meet it have not even been built. More ominous is that their competitors, including Chinese open source developers, are strongly positioned to outcompete them in virtually every product category. But they didn't factor in this competition in their 2027 projections.\n\nAll of that is actually somewhat of an aside. If OpenAI were to cease to exist tomorrow, their competitors would quickly and seamlessly capture their revenue-generating markets. Their absence would cause no shortage of AI services or products. They offer no unique product that their competitors have not already built. They have no special patents that provide them with a moat. They are simply no longer necessary to the AI space because their competitors can do everything that they do, and often at far less cost. \n\nSo don't let OpenAI tell you that they are necessary to the AI space. Neither they, nor Google, nor Anthropic, nor the Chinese developers, are necessary to advancing AI because there are now so many companies building models. The space will continue to expand and become increasingly lucrative for decades to come regardless of who is in the game.\n\n",

They use \"ChatGPT\" because of its name... and because they still don't know about other models. \n\n\nAnd there is another phenomenon I'm noticing, which by 2026 will become much more evident to more people: in some cases, Chinese models are already better than American ones. And those who don't use them do so out of pure prejudice or also due to a certain degree of \"inexperience.\"",

Is it just American users who will be affected by the sale of TikTok to Larry Ellison? I am talking specifically about censorship.

Let's talk about something else.\n\nIs DeepSeek compromised by Israel, or is it the way I asked the question?\n\nA Has anyone else seen this?  or am I being paranoid here. ",

      "text": "\n\n\nDevelopers like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google may think that because their frontier models are top tier across many use cases, that's enough to win the enterprise race. But open source/Chinese developers will be competing for very specific niche domains where they already OPERATIONALLY MATCH OR EXCEED the performance of top proprietary models AT A FRACTION OF THE COST. Understanding this is important to personal investors, as more open source/Chinese developers issue IPOs.\n\nFor decades, large US corporations and personal investors have sought a higher ROI by outsourcing and investing in Chinese firms. There are no signs that this is letting up. As Chinese AI developers issue IPOs, we should expect substantial American investments in increasingly competitive open source/Chinese models. As evidence, the venture capitalist firm a16z has said that 80% of the startups pitching them for funding are using Chinese open-source AI models. That tells you a lot. \n\nHere are some open source/Chinese models that are already matching or exceeding top models from American AI giants in performance and cost, courtesy Gemini 3:\n\n \"* DeepSeek-V3 / R1 (DeepSeek AI)\n   * Performance: Ranked #1 on MATH-500 and LiveCodeBench. R1 matches OpenAI o3-Pro in complex reasoning and logical proofs.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: OpenAI o3-Pro, GPT-5.2.\n   * Cost: $0.27 (Input) / $1.10 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $15.00+ per 1M).\n\n * Qwen3-Max / Coder (Alibaba)\n   * Performance: Top 3 on LMSYS Chatbot Arena (Overall/Coding) and MMLU-Pro. It is currently the most versatile open-weight model for agentic workflows.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Claude 4.5 Sonnet, GPT-5.1.\n   * Cost: $0.22 – $0.50 (Input) / $0.95 – $5.00 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $3.00 – $10.00 per 1M).\n\n * Ernie 5.0 (Baidu)\n   * Performance: Ranked #2 globally on the LMArena Math leaderboard; top 3 in multimodal benchmarks like MathVista.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.1.\n   * Cost: $0.30 (Input) / $1.20 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $1.25 – $2.50 per 1M).\n\n * Kimi K2 Thinking (Moonshot AI)\n   * Performance: Top 3 in Long-Context (RULER) and ARC-AGI-2. Known for 1M+ token context windows and deep reasoning traces.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Claude 4.5 Opus, Gemini 3 Pro.\n   * Cost: $0.15 (Input with cache) / $1.50 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $5.00 – $15.00 per 1M).\n\n * GLM-4.7 / 5.0 (Zhipu AI)\n   * Performance: Top 3 in Code Arena and tool-use benchmarks (90%+ success rate).\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 3 Flash.\n   * Cost: $0.60 (Input) / $2.20 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $3.00+ per 1M).\"\n\nKeep in mind that enterprise AI is quite new, and that Chinese firms are just getting started. Also, they are hyper focused on very NARROW niches rather than on AGI, and know how to undercut their competition. Again, to minimize losses and maximum gains,\npersonal investors should take note.",

      "text": "I’ve been reflecting a lot lately on the current state of DeepSeek, and I wanted to share some personal observations to see if the community feels the same way.\n\nFor a long time, I considered DeepSeek a true pioneer. It was the \"gold standard\" for me a free, highly capable model that felt genuinely uncensored, especially when compared to the heavy-handed guardrails of Western models like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. At its peak, it didn't just compete; it often outperformed them in terms of raw utility and creative freedom.\n\nHowever, recently, I’ve noticed a disappointing shift. The latest versions and updates feel like a step backward rather than the leap forward we were all expecting. Specifically:\n\n1. **Increased Censorship:** The model has become significantly more restrictive. Responses that used to be nuanced and direct are now frequently hit by \"policy\" filters or generic refusals.\n2. **Degradation in Quality:** There’s a noticeable dip in the \"intelligence\" of the outputs. It feels less sharp and more prone to generic or repetitive answers.\n3. **A Broader Trend:** This doesn't seem isolated to DeepSeek. I’ve noticed similar patterns with Alibaba’s models and even Kimi (though Kimi still holds up relatively well).\n\nIt feels like something fundamental has changed behind closed doors regarding strategy or regulatory compliance in China. It’s disheartening because DeepSeek was my go-to daily driver. Now, I find myself using it and even Qwen only occasionally, as they no longer provide that \"limitless\" edge they once had.\n\nI want to stay optimistic about the next rumored release, but given the current trajectory, I’m starting to have my doubts.\n\n**What are your thoughts?** Have you noticed a decline in output quality or a \"tightening\" of the filters recently? Is the era of the \"uncensored\" Chinese powerhouse model coming to an end, or is this just a temporary roadblock?\n\nCurious to hear your experiences.",

One example of a Gemini fail was comparing the features of five Canon imageClass printers that were similar models. MF743Cdw and the like. I was looking for basic information, like one or two paper trays, support for faxing, double-sided scanning, etc. I didn't think it was a heavy lift.\n\nChatGPT, when I ask about other electronics, will rephrase my question as a statement and direct me to the website where I can do my own research. Please. I'm asking AI because I don't have the bandwidth to do the legwork myself. That's what I've been doing my whole life. Lol\n\nPersonally, I'm afraid of sponsored answers in the name of capitalism, corruption to protect people in power and their wealthy donors, censorship in the name of safety, and other such things that mask or distort the truth.

      "text": "\n\n\n\nOne thing Musk is known for is doing big things in a fraction of the time that it takes others to do them. For example, his team brought the Colossus super computer online in only 122 days, when a project of this magnitude usually takes 2 to 4 years from start to finish. \n\nSo when one of his updates is delayed, and delayed again, you know that something is amiss in xAI land. On December 7th, 2025, Musk announced that Grok 4.2 would be released in 3 or 4 weeks. We are now a few days from February 2026, and there are no signs of the release. Could this mean that the brute force scaling approach has plateaued?\n\nIf we were to guess at the reason for those delays, the most probable is that GPT, Gemini, and even Chinese open source models, have gotten so good so quickly that Musk kept discovering his Grok 4.2 was not proving itself competitive enough on major benchmarks. \n\nOf course the final verdict, at least for the time being, on where we are with the scaling laws won't come until Grok 5 is released in March. Because it will be trained on Colossus 2, with 550 GPUs rather than Colossus 1's 1-200, and built with Nvidia's far more powerful GB200 and GB300 Blackwell chips, we should not be surprised if it blows every other model completely out of the water! And it will surely incorporate the Engram primitive and Poetiq's meta system, further amplifying its reasoning power. This means it will probably have an IQ exceeding 160. \n\nI hope we are nowhere near the plateauing of scaling laws, and that Grok 5 sets a very high new bar that the other developers will scramble to quickly catch up with. But until xAI finally releases Grok 4.2, serving as an interim indicator, we can only wait with mounting expectation.\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nFirst, I've limited this to OpenAI and Anthropic, not including Google or xAI, because the latter have revenue streams that let them navigate the next few years without the cash crunch that the former will face because of their huge debt burdens.\n\nTheir competition will not come from Google and xAI, who will be facing the exact same monumental headwinds over the next few years. Their competition will come from open source and Chinese developers who will flood the market with small, dedicated, much less expensive models. \n\nThe reasoning for this is obvious. Let's say your company needed some accounting services. Would you obtain them from a small accounting firm who just does accounting, and so does it very well? Or would you obtain them from a large corporate conglomerate that markets every conceivable product like healthcare, scientific discovery, building construction, restaurant services, and lawn care?\n\nThis analogy highlights the all-important difference between LLMs that do everything and SLMs that do just one thing, but do it very well. To dominate the enterprise space, Open source and Chinese developers will be building very small language models for very specific niche business tasks that run locally at a fraction of the cost of LLMs.\n\nYou might be asking why OpenAI and Anthropic can't market their own competitive SLMs. The answer to this is simple. There are many thousands of these specific narrow domain business tasks that SLMs will be built to excel at, and the bloated bureaucracies that come with being a major developer like OpenAI and Anthropic render such an ambition a virtually impossible logistical nightmare. \n\nTo better illustrate this, here are some examples of the kinds of business departments within which these specific tasks are performed; human resources, finance and accounting, operations, sales, marketing, information technology, customer service, R&D, legal and compliance and supply chain and logistics.\n\nBut that's just the beginning. Taking finance and accounting as an example, here are some of the more specific tasks within those departments that SLMs will be built to perform; invoice data extraction, transaction categorization, bank reconciliation matching, expense report auditing, duplicate payment detection, purchase order matching, regulatory compliance monitoring, and it goes on and on.\n\nWhy can't LLMs perform all of those very specific tasks as well as SLMs? There are many reasons. Here are just a few of the advantages that SLMs offer; lower latency and faster processing, reduced computational and operational costs, higher accuracy through specialized fine-tuning, enhanced data privacy and local deployment options, lower energy consumption and infrastructure requirements.\n\nYou probably now understand why it would be virtually impossible for OpenAI and Anthropic to compete with SLMs on these multitude of very specific business use cases. \n\nIt is because the AI giants can't possibly market LLMs to compete in all of these very specific business use cases that over the next 2 years there will be an explosion of lean open source and Chinese startups that will build SLMs dedicated to doing one specific business task exceptionally well at a very low cost. \n\nWhat can the AI giants do, if anything, to become competitive in this emerging narrow domain enterprise space? That is the trillion dollar question before them.\n\n \n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Many businesses don't trust Chinese companies to host the models and don't want to bother with custom hosting options. \n\nSo many companies buy Microsoft products that everyone hates when there are likely cheaper better alternatives but IT doesn't want to deal with managing procurement and will pay more for easy to manage solutions.\n\nI think OpenAi will struggle but anthropic has models that are much more enjoyable to be deal with. I find I'm frustrated with Claude so much less than any other model. That alone is worth an extra $100/mo for me. \n\nWith the ammount of value you can get out of AI, if you are doing that highly profitable, having the best AI models that have a full suite of services that are integrated like Claude Cowork are totally worth it.",

              "text": "Look back to the decades of outsourcing where many American manufacturers went to the Chinese because they were building better products at a lower cost. I think politics have made people a bit afraid of the Chinese recently, but ultimately higher ROIs will replace that distrust. Yeah Anthropic is really good at UI, but that's not something that is so difficult for their competitors to emulate.",

(Whether above or below the table.) That's a huge selling point for companies.\n\nI agree smaller models make sense in many cases. And even more so private self hosted models. But sometimes you have to fit inside the frameworks forced on you.",
