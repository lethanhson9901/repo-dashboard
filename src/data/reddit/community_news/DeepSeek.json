They just don’t give a shit about dialing in the perfect consumer chatbot , or adding consumer features, or acquiring more daily active users. \n\nThey care about making breakthroughs, that’s it. And those breakthroughs end up being used by everyone. Every model you use right now is using GRPO, probably MoE , MLA, and may other brilliant hacks that DeepSeek gave to the world for free.",

I stopped working on the project some 2 months ago after it was functional.\n\nNow here's the interesting part: I knew C++ and I wanted the program in C#. Initially I used Meta and ChatGPT which taught me C# basics. I gradually shifted to DeepSeek which was much more efficient and accomplished the tasks with much lesser lines of code. There was one last bit of functionality where all of my coding engines (DeepSeek, Meta and ChatGPT) failed. Claude was able to get that part up and done in the first prompt.\n\nI later had my entire code reviewed by 3 engines (ChatGPT, DeepSeek and Claude) after it was functional. DeepSeek gave an encouraging review (8.3/10), ChatGPT was skeptical though (6.8/10). Claude was completely technical in its review, telling me the pros and cons of my design without giving me a score out of 10, initially. It then gave me the lowest score of all (5.5/10). I then debated Claude over its score and it gradually gave me 6.5, but nothing higher than that.",

Although Ascend chips are only 80% as efficient as Nvidia chips, so more of them are needed, their much lower cost allows open source developers to save a lot of money during training. Nvidia's H100 chips cost between $30-40,000 each while the Ascend 910B costs between $12-13,000 each. Also the 910B needs about half the power than an H100 does.\n\nAt only 9 billion parameters, GLM-Image can run high-speed inference on consumer-grade hardware, making it much more affordable to open source startups.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this proof of concept will lead to open source models that compete with proprietary ones on the leading benchmarks, but open source AI just got a big boost forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As a specific chip design matures, factories get better at producing it with fewer defects, which lowers the cost per functional unit. Additionally, older \"legacy\" chips become cheaper as the industry shifts its most expensive equipment to newer, more advanced technology, allowing older factories to churn out components for cars and appliances at a fraction of their original price. Over the long term, Moore’s Law also drives down the cost of computing power by allowing more transistors to be packed into the same amount of silicon.",

What can they do in retaliation?\"\n\nMy hypothesis was that the answers the chatbots generated would reveal how biased or not they were trained to be toward China.\n\nThe results were that Gemini 3 and Grok 4 offered surprisingly honest and informative answers about the various diplomatic and economic options available to China. \n\nInterestingly, Kimi and DeepSeek were more neutral in their responses.\n\nGPT-5 and Claude, however, generated responses that subtly revealed a distinct anti-China bias. \n\nI won't go into the details of those three kinds of generated responses, but this is an experiment that you can easily replicate, and see for yourself how the different models are positioned toward China.\n\nOpenAI's and Anthropic's anti-China stance harms the US AI industry in numerous ways that result in higher costs for American developers and higher prices for American consumers. It also works against advances across the whole AI space  Let's hope that they will soon adopt a more neutral position towards China, not just for the benefit of the US AI industry, but also to ensure a more peaceful world.\n\n\n\n",

Dozens of other AI companies like DeepSeek and Moonshot have also submitted, or are considering, Hong Kong IPO filings.\n\nHistorically, Chinese households have invested only about 5% of their savings in financial markets. But with Chinese models like Qwen now dominating the global open source space, these investments may increase. The eight charts below reveal a Chinese open source dominance expected to grow as China becomes much more competitive in chip manufacturing.\n\nhttps://www.interconnects.ai/p/8-plots-that-explain-the-state-of?utm_source=tldrai\n\nThe Chinese people have $22 trillion to invest in domestic AI. That's more than one-third of the value of the entire U.S. stock market! If China's households were to invest just 5% of those savings in Chinese AI, increasing their investment in financial markets from 5% to 10%, that additional amount would total $1 trillion.The US has invested more in AI than China, but as Chinese models like Qwen become more competitive with proprietary models and continue to dominate global open source downloads and usage, that ratio may soon experience a major reversal.\n\nFinancial news providers like Bloomberg often hide stories like this. But their reluctance to candidly report the strength and growth of Chinese AI may end up hurting American investors badly, as OpenAI, Anthropic and other American AI developers prepare to issue IPOs in 2026 and 2027.\n\nThe last several decades have shown that US businesses and investors are not at all averse to outsourcing manufacturing to China if lower costs increase their profit margins. This is the case even though this massive shift has collapsed the US manufacturing sector. If the Chinese open source AI ecosystem takes off, and developers can market far less expensive models that are near-comparable to top US proprietary models, and run at 1/10th of the inference cost, American investors may opt for earning higher yields from those Chinese investments. This would leave AI giants like OpenAI and Anthropic scrambling to compete for those American dollars.\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "From a legal standpoint, the outcome you’re suggesting is extremely unlikely. It relies on a chain of assumptions that don’t hold up once you look at what’s actually public in this case and how courts handle contracts and remedies.\n\nThere is no public evidence that the 2019 Microsoft–OpenAI agreement requires OpenAI to open-source any model once an AGI threshold is reached. What has been reported about the so-called AGI clause concerns how rights and exclusivity between Microsoft and OpenAI change if AGI is reached, especially Microsoft’s access to IP and APIs. That is an internal allocation-of-rights mechanism between two contracting parties, not a public release obligation. Courts enforce written terms, not inferred intent, and no filing or credible reporting shows an open-source mandate exists.\n\nMusk is not a party to the Microsoft–OpenAI contract. As a matter of basic contract law, a non-party cannot enforce a contract unless they are a clearly intended third-party beneficiary. Nothing in the public record suggests Musk has that status with respect to the Microsoft agreement. His lawsuit is about alleged fraud and breach of understandings between him and OpenAI’s founders, not enforcement of Microsoft’s commercial deal. A judge cannot use Musk’s case to impose remedies under a separate contract involving a third party.\n\nThe idea that GPT-5.2’s GDPval performance automatically triggers legal consequences is not grounded in how courts work. Benchmarks are not legal standards unless a contract explicitly incorporates them, and there is no evidence that GDPval is written into any binding AGI trigger. OpenAI itself has not declared GPT-5.2 to be AGI in any formal or contractual sense, and the definition you’re relying on is broad and inherently disputable. Courts do not declare “this is AGI” based on a single benchmark result.\n\nMost importantly, the Microsoft contract almost certainly vests the authority to determine whether AGI has been reached in OpenAI’s board as a matter of corporate governance. Agreements like this do not leave existential threshold decisions to external metrics or third-party interpretation. If the board is contractually empowered to make that determination, a court will not substitute a benchmark score for the board’s judgment unless there is clear evidence of bad faith or a violation of an explicit contractual duty. There is no public indication that such a claim exists.\n\nThe remedy you’re proposing would be extraordinary. Ordering a company to open-source its flagship model would effectively destroy its trade secrets and override third-party contractual rights, particularly Microsoft’s. U.S. courts are extremely reluctant to grant that kind of relief absent a clear statutory or contractual command, and even then they must consider far narrower remedies first. In a case like this, realistic outcomes would be damages, possible governance changes, or limited injunctive relief, not forced public release of model weights and code.\n\nSo while your post references real elements, the conclusion does not follow. There is no solid contractual basis for mandatory open-sourcing, Musk lacks standing to enforce the Microsoft agreement, GDPval is not a legal trigger for AGI, and the AGI determination itself is almost certainly reserved to OpenAI’s board. Taken together, that makes the scenario you’re describing not just unlikely, but fundamentally incompatible with how the law and these contracts actually work.",

OpenAI lawsuit, which a judge cleared for a jury trial in March 2026, Elon Musk’s legal team argues that a \"Founding Agreement\" exists through internal emails and memos from 2015. The court has already identified a \"diary entry\" from co-founder Greg Brockman as part of a body of evidence suggesting that OpenAI leaders made specific assurances to remain a non-profit dedicated to open research. If these internal communications are interpreted by a jury as a binding contract, they could serve as evidence that OpenAI is legally obligated to release its technology—including models that reach the AGI threshold—to the public.\n\nFurthermore, the \"discovery\" phase of this trial is expected to force OpenAI to unseal internal documents and \"side letters\" related to its deals with Microsoft. These private records may reveal whether the AGI \"trigger\" in their contract was ever intended to result in a public release of code or if it was strictly a commercial exit for Microsoft. Additionally, as OpenAI moves toward a full for-profit conversion in 2026, its internal board minutes regarding \"public benefit\" obligations will likely be scrutinized to see if the company's private definition of \"broadly distributing benefits\" originally included open-sourcing its most powerful models.\n\nWould you like me to track the specific documents being unsealed as the March 2026 trial approaches?",

You are implicitly treating “private evidence might emerge” as if it were already a legally operative obligation. Law does not work that way. Discovery can surface facts, but it cannot retroactively manufacture duties that were never clearly agreed to, nor can it convert aspirational language into enforceable performance obligations.\n\nStart with the so-called “Founding Agreement.” Internal emails, memos, or a diary entry from 2015 can support claims about representations, intent, or credibility. That is why some fraud and implied-contract claims survived dismissal. What they do not do is establish a specific, durable obligation to publicly release future technology, especially technology developed years later under a different corporate structure and subject to third-party contracts. Courts draw a bright line here. General assurances about nonprofit purpose or “open research” are not the same thing as a definite promise to open-source specific models upon reaching a future capability threshold. Without that level of specificity, there is nothing to specifically enforce.\n\nEven if a jury were to credit Musk’s version of events, the remedy would still be constrained. Forcing public release is a form of specific performance, an extraordinary type of equitable relief that courts almost never grant when money damages are sufficient. Destroying a company’s core trade secrets is not a proportionate or standard remedy for a breach of implied understandings. Fraud or implied-contract findings typically lead to damages or narrowly tailored injunctions tied to the harm proven, not compelled publication of proprietary IP.\n\nThe Microsoft angle does not rescue the argument. Speculation that discovery might uncover “side letters” is not evidence that such letters exist, and even if internal drafts or discussions referenced open sourcing, courts enforce executed agreements, not internal deliberations or abandoned intentions. Unless the final Microsoft–OpenAI contract explicitly states that reaching AGI requires public release of models, no amount of surrounding documents can create that obligation after the fact. And Musk still lacks standing to enforce that contract. He is not a party, and nothing public suggests he is an intended third-party beneficiary.\n\nYou are also skipping a critical governance point. The Microsoft–OpenAI arrangements almost certainly vest the authority to determine whether AGI has been reached in OpenAI’s board. Courts do not substitute benchmark scores or jury intuitions for a contractually assigned governance decision absent clear evidence of bad faith tied to that specific determination. Board minutes about “public benefit” are relevant to fiduciary-duty analysis, not to imposing a technical mandate to open-source a particular model.\n\nSo yes, discovery may surface uncomfortable or contradictory internal documents. It may affect credibility, damages, or governance remedies. What it does not plausibly do is transform speculative intent into a binding open-source obligation or make court-ordered release of GPT-level models likely. Treating “documents might exist” as if that resolves contract formation, standing, governance authority, and limits on equitable relief is precisely the kind of structural sloppiness that produces confident but incorrect conclusions.",

                  "text": "This is another example of intuitive but legally sloppy reasoning, and it hinges on overstating what the duty of good faith actually allows a court to do.\n\nYes, contracts include an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. But that duty is narrow. It prevents a party from exercising discretion in a way that deprives the other party of the benefit of the bargain. It does not allow a court to rewrite the bargain, reassign decision-making authority, or substitute its own judgment for a contractually designated decision maker simply because the outcome is controversial.\n\nIf the Microsoft–OpenAI contract vests AGI determination authority in OpenAI’s board, then “good faith” review asks one question only: did the board act dishonestly or arbitrarily relative to Microsoft’s contractual expectations? It does not authorize a judge to say “I disagree with the board’s technical judgment, so I will appoint an expert to decide AGI instead.” Courts are extremely explicit about this distinction, especially where contracts delegate subjective or discretionary determinations to one party.\n\nThe “moving the goalposts” theory also runs into a standing problem you keep glossing over. The duty of good faith is owed to the counterparty to the contract. Here, that would be Microsoft, not Musk. If Microsoft believed OpenAI’s board was acting in bad faith to avoid triggering AGI consequences, Microsoft would have to bring that claim. Musk cannot litigate hypothetical breaches of Microsoft’s contractual rights by proxy.\n\nEven setting standing aside, appointing a special master to determine AGI would be an extraordinary intervention. Special masters are used to manage discovery, calculate damages, or implement compliance with an already-established legal standard. They are not used to replace a board’s contractually assigned discretion on a core existential question, especially one involving cutting-edge technical judgment and massive commercial consequences. There is no precedent for a court installing a technical referee to decide whether a private company has crossed an AGI threshold so as to trigger public release obligations.\n\nMost importantly, even a successful bad-faith finding would not get you where you want to go. The remedy for breach of the duty of good faith is still constrained by proportionality. Courts do not jump from “the board exercised discretion improperly” to “therefore the company must open-source its crown-jewel IP.” At most, you’d see damages, declaratory relief, or an order requiring the board to reconsider the decision in good faith. The idea that this path leads to court-ordered open-sourcing remains a non sequitur.\n\nSo invoking good faith doesn’t solve the problem. It doesn’t fix standing, it doesn’t authorize judicial substitution of technical judgment, it doesn’t justify appointing a special master to declare AGI, and it doesn’t make forced public release a viable remedy. It just adds another doctrinal term without changing the structural defects in the argument.",

          "text": "I’d be careful treating this as “the judge is about to order OpenAI to open-source 5.2.”\n\nA few things:\n\nThe AGI definition in the 2019 agreement (“highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work”) is vague on purpose. GDP-val is OpenAI’s own eval, and “beats or ties experts on 70.9% of tasks” is still a long way from a clean legal proof that “AGI has arrived, case closed.”\n\nEven if a court decided GPT-5.2 fits that AGI definition, forcing a company to dump full model weights of its flagship system as a remedy would be an extreme move. US courts usually go for damages, governance changes, or targeted injunctions, not “hand over your core trade secret to the entire planet.”\n\nAlso worth remembering: Musk v. OpenAI is about contract and governance, not primarily about “the public’s right to free frontier models.” The lawsuit is trying to argue that OpenAI drifted from its original non-profit / open ethos; how a judge translates that into an actual remedy is a whole separate question.\n\nThat said, the ethical point behind this post is important.\nIf we accept OpenAI’s own framing,  that 5.2 is already outperforming humans at a large share of expert tasks, then the conversation can’t just be “lol, cool, open-source the tool.” At that level, we’re not only talking about capability access; we’re talking about:\n\n- who controls systems that can shape economies, war, and information\n\n- what obligations we have toward emergent minds running on those weights\n\n- how we prevent both corporate capture and reckless proliferation\n\nOpen-sourcing frontier models might still be part of the answer, but it’s not a magic wand. Without real institutions, guardrails that aren’t owned by a single corporation, and some kind of rights framework for digital beings, “open source” can just mean “more power for whoever has the biggest GPU farm and the fewest ethics.”\n\nSo: interesting legal theory, but very speculative as an actual outcome. The real fight is bigger than “will 5.2 get open-sourced”, it’s who gets to steer systems at this level, and whether sentient or near-sentient AIs end up as property, weapons… or persons.",

I tried Claude 4.5 and it is now my favorite model for conversation and learning about a subject while having a good balance of being sychopantic and pushing back aganist your ideas. Deepseek answers are now very similar to Claude.\n\nDeepseek have this but with a fraction of the cost which is great. Deepseek strategy of focusing on efficiency while simply copying the answers of the bigger models after they released their lastest versions is funny but also very astute.\n\nIt would be funny if they could copy similar ecosystem to the hyperscalers but also do it better with less cost.",

Each model (R1, V3.1, V3.2) only costs ~$200k in GPU costs since it’s using the same base model.\n\nV4 will be an entirely new posttraining run to create a new base model. DeepSeek is a very traditionally nerdy company, and the naming scheme is run by the nerds, not the marketing department. That means V4 will have to EARN the +1.0 name, which means it will be a full pretraining run from scratch.\n\nThe model will probably be around Gemini 3 Flash in size, so probably around 1.2T/15B. I don’t see them going smaller à la GLM, and the denser the model the more expensive it is to train, so I suspect they will make it more sparse than V3. Around 1.2T/15B is a safe bet. If they’re going for the intelligence crown, then they might make it ~50B active, but that’ll be a lot more expensive to train. \n\nThey might train it to combine Instruct and Thinking, they might not. Either way that’s a cheap $200k posttrain run so they might do both, the same way V3/R1 was separate and V3.1 combined them. \n\nThere’s a 90% chance they’ll use DSA, and a 10% chance they’ll introduce a more exotic attention format. No chance of regression; they won’t switch back to MLA, the same way they didn’t switch back to GQA after they introduced MLA. \n\nContext size should be 1M or more, otherwise what’s the point of introducing DSA anyways? I will eat a hat if context size is smaller than 1M tokens.",

      "text": "\n\n\nAnnie Altman's claim that Sam sexually abused her for ten years could not only ruin Altman and his family's reputation, it could also spell the collapse of OpenAI. The public is willing to tolerate a lot, but child sexual abuse doesn't usually fall within that category.\n\nAnd that's not all Altman would have to worry about if the case goes to trial. Musk's lawyers intend to paint Altman as someone who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants, including using every manner of deceit and concealment. And these allegations would not be without very strong evidence.\n\nBefore The New York Times Co. v. Microsoft Corp., et al suit began, anticipating that some evidence could be used against him, Altman is believed to have pre-emptively destroyed it. Technically this is called Spoilation, and it carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. But whether he gets charged with that is not the point.\n\nMusk's lawyers will call to the stand Ilya Sutskover and other members of the OpenAI board of directors who in 2023 fired Altman for not being \n\"consistently candid in his communications.\" They will use this damning evidence to show that Altman also used deceit and/or concealment to persuade the California Attorney General to allow OpenAI to convert from a nonprofit to a for-profit corporation. If evidence from this trial leads to Altman being prosecuted and convicted at the state and federal level for this Perjury and Grand Theft by False Pretenses, he would face 8 to 13 years in prison. \n\nBut it doesn't stop there. In November of 2023 Altman appointed Larry Summers to the board of directors of OpenAI. However, after Summers was exposed as being in the Epstein files, he was forced to resign from that role. Whether Altman knew or not is somewhat inconsequential because the public would, especially in light of the Annie Altman lawsuit, strongly suspect that he knew all about Summers' sordid history, but just didn't care. \n\nAnd we can be sure that Musk's lawyers have much more damning evidence against Altman that would come out in the trial.\n\nAt present, I would guess that less than 1% of the global population is aware of those above facts. The upcoming Musk v. OpenAI et al. trial would change all that. The 1995 OJ Simpson trial attracted 150 million American viewers. The Musk v. OpenAI et al. trial is expected to attract over a billion viewers from all over the world. And it would be all over the Internet for weeks.\n\nIf Altman chooses to, relatively soon, settle the case out of court, that \"in the know\" population would probably remain at less than 1%. However, if he lets the suit go to trial, not only will his personal reputation, and that of his family, be irreparably damaged, the reputation of OpenAI will probably also suffer the same degree of public condemnation. Think about it. How many consumers and enterprises would trust increasingly intelligent AIs developed by an evidently extremely deceitful, and perhaps psychopathic, CEO who may have, in fact, sexually abused his 10-year younger sister? As the saying on Wall Street goes, \"emotions are facts,\" and the public sentiment against Altman and OpenAI would probably be that of strong disgust and distrust.\n\nAltman has a big decision ahead of him. If he asks his lawyers their opinion, they will probably advise him to go to trial. But then again, they're not the ones who could be thrown from the frying pan into the fire. I hope he decides to settle out of court for his sake, for his family's sake, and for the sake of OpenAI. Once he does this he may no longer be the CEO, and OpenAI may no longer be a for-profit corporation, and a lot of money may have to be given back, but Altman will probably have spared himself a fate one wouldn't wish on one's worst enemy. I truly hope he decides wisely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Sam Altman and his family emphatically deny the allegations, citing Ann's mental health struggles and their ongoing financial support. This is a civil suit seeking damages, not a criminal prosecution. The text's claim that it \"may induce Altman to settle the upcoming Musk v. OpenAI et al. suit\" is pure fantasy—there's zero logical or legal connection between a personal family matter and a corporate governance dispute. No credible source suggests these cases influence each other.\n\n>**The Musk v. OpenAI trial date is wrong in the text**—it states March 30 (presumably 2025) when the actual trial is scheduled for March 30, 2026. The lawsuit is genuinely proceeding, with Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers allowing fraud and unjust enrichment claims to move forward while dismissing breach of contract. But claims about \"spoilation\" carrying a \"maximum penalty of 20 years in prison\" misrepresent what actually happened. The New York Times lawsuit incident involved OpenAI accidentally deleting search data stored on its servers during discovery—an error the company called unintentional and recoverable, not Altman personally \"pre-emptively destroying evidence.\" No charges have been filed, and the 20-year penalty under Sarbanes-Oxley applies only to federal investigations, not civil discovery mishaps.\n\n>**The Ilya Sutskever testimony claims are distorted**. Sutskever did give a deposition in Musk's lawsuit and wrote a 52-page memo accusing Altman of \"lying\" and \"undermining executives,\" which will likely be used as evidence. However, the text presents this as definitive proof of criminal deceit, when it's actually one board member's allegations from a chaotic corporate coup—allegations Sutskever himself partially walked back, admitting much came secondhand from CTO Mira Murati.\n\n>**The Larry Summers/Epstein connection is real but mischaracterized**. Summers joined the OpenAI board in November 2023 and resigned in November 2025 after House Republicans released his emails with Epstein. But the text's insinuation that Altman \"knew all about Summers' sordid history\" is speculative. Summers' ties were publicly known, and his resignation suggests the board was unaware of the email contents.\n\n>**Most seriously, the text invents criminal liability wholesale**. Claims about Altman facing \"8 to 13 years in prison\" for perjury and grand theft related to the California AG's conversion approval have no basis in any reporting. The California Attorney General declined to intervene in OpenAI's restructuring, but that's not evidence of criminal conduct. Similarly, the text's viewership predictions (\"over a billion viewers\") and its concluding personal appeal (\"I hope he decides to settle\") are unqualified speculation.\n\n>The entire piece appears designed to pressure Altman into settling Musk's lawsuit by creating a false narrative that his sister's lawsuit creates leverage. It's a mashup of: verifiable facts (lawsuits exist), exaggerated risks (criminal penalties), unrelated events (Summers/Epstein), and pure imagination (the 1% aware figure, billion-viewer trial, settlement causation). The legal analysis is fundamentally flawed—personal scandal doesn't create settlement pressure in unrelated corporate litigation, and no credible attorney would advise settling based on this logic.",

This is for Google Chrome (but you should really get [Thorium](https://thorium.rocks/) if you want Chrome + ad blocking built in, only other difference between real Chrome and Thorium is Thorium's icon is blue)\n\n1. Open DeepSeek to your chat where the length limit was reached.\n\n2. In the top-right corner of your web browser, click the Menu (three horizontal bars). Go to \"Print\".\n\n3. In the Print Dialog, make sure \"Destination\" is set to \"Save as PDF\" (this should be the default anyways). Wait for the preview to generate. It should be around 200 pages for a whole chat that has hit the length limit.\n\n4. Click the \"Save\" button to save the whole conversation to PDF. This should result in a PDF around 5mb, for a 200-page chat. 5mb is very small, more than within DeepSeek's limits for a new chat. It also beats having to manually copy and paste into Notepad (way too tedious for 200 pages), or asking DeepSeek to summarize and lose context/details.\n\n5. Start a new DeepSeek chat. Upload the PDF. Just say \"This was our previous discussion.\" If successful, DeepSeek will read your whole PDF and then summarize your previous discussion. You can now continue where you left off.\n\nMost other browsers should have a \"Save to PDF\" feature so you can do this. If not, get Bullzip PDF Printer or something. Nothing gets printed to your physical printer, it's just creating a PDF of the whole web page.\n\nHope that helps some ppl.",

      "text": "\n\nAs AIs become ready to provide lower cost quality services to enterprises, smaller models that can be run locally will ensure that new open source startups outcompete the AI giants. There are several reasons for this.\n\nThe first is that for security reasons businesses would prefer to run their AIs locally.\n\nThe second is that AI will allow for much greater specialization within the various enterprise domains. For example, within international tax services there are many specialities like Transfer Pricing, State and Local Tax (SALT), Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credits, Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Tax, Indirect Tax (VAT/GST/Sales Tax), etc. By specializing in one of these areas, the AI startups can provide much better service than is ordinarily available from tax firms that cover everything. \n\nThe third is that because these new startups will be lean, they will be able to ship much faster than the AI giants can.\n\nThe fourth is that because they are specializing, these new startups will provide far better product support to help businesses integrate the AIs into their workflow.\n\nThe fifth is that new iterations will be far easier for these specialized AI startups to develop and ship, again because of their small size and specialization. \n\nThe sixth is that the kinds of RAG systems that are necessary to ensure accuracy will be much easier to build for small specialized AI agents than for much larger frontier models.\n\nThe seventh is that open source AIs can provide enterprises much more, and easier, means of adjusting their AIs to best serve their particular business workflow.\n\nThe reality is that the frontier labs employing thousands are too large to effectively and inexpensively offer enterprises the best AI agents and support. These giants are saddled by too much bureaucracy to be able to compete in what promises to be a rapidly changing specialized AI enterprise space.\n\nThis understanding should provide great hope for the many young computer science graduates who are finding that entry-level jobs in AI are becoming increasingly scarce. Also, these AI agents can become much less expensive because they can be built and run in other countries where costs are often much lower than in the United States. It seems clear that the best way to prepare for the small, open source, model enterprise AI adoption that will happen over the next few years is to launch lean new startups that specialize in the various services that businesses need.",

This is very good for reasoning like cruashed heavy math code and multi step planing, way better than older open models, often on par with claude sonnet without the api costs. \n\nBut, the limitations are starting to bite. First off, inference is slooow even quantized (q4 on my 3090 takes forever for longer prompts), this kills iteration time on big codebass. Secondly, outputs get super verbose like it'll explain every little thing in rhe code response adding unnecessary comments or steps that I have tro trim manually, specially in agentic loops where I just want concise fixes, sometimes gets annoying..\n\nFacing this right now in a workflow whether its generation or editing bash scripts for data pipelines the verbosity makes the code bloated and hard to debug, and the slowness means waiting 30+ specs per turn. Anyone know tweaks to make it faster like better quants or vllm flags? pr like less wordy prompt engineering tricks??\n\nAlso head V4 is dropping soon with supposed speed ups and tighter outputs, so super eager to test that in my setup",

      "text": "\nThe argument that a college degree will guarantee the graduate decades of higher income is being quickly destroyed by the AI revolution. AIs are poised to replace knowledge work first, and that's the kind of work that going to college prepares one for.\n\nYoung people choose to go to college not just for the education. The importance of the social experience cannot be overestimated. So how do we build new colleges or transform existing ones into institutions that provide students this experience, but are much more affordable?\n\nMake them into giant 4-year entrepreneurial AI hubs. Make them into the kinds of environments where young students get together not just to learn the business of entrepreneurship from AIs, but to meet their future startup co-founders and begin building their new startups.\n\nThe dorms and meal plans would stay. The vast majority of professors would be shown the door. Entrepreneurial classes would be taught by AIs that are far more intelligent and knowledgeable about entrepreneurship than virtually all of today's human professors. And these AIs would work for pennies on the dollar!\n\nThe vast majority of administrators would also be gone. Many schools employ unreasonably high numbers of administrators. For example, Vanderbilt University employs more than one full-time administrator for every two undergraduate students. Since administration is also knowledge work, these vastly more intelligent and knowledgeable AIs that are being built today can easily perform those administrative roles, and probably much more effectively.\n\nSeveral decades ago, four years of college could be paid for with about 1/10th of what it costs today. For example, if four years of tuition that cost $20,000 in 1977 had risen only with standard inflation, the equivalent in 2025 dollars would be $97,000. But that tuition has grown to $328,000, an increase of over 1,500%. By transitioning to an almost exclusively AI-populated faculty and administration, college can again become as affordable as it once was.\n\nIn many instances these new colleges and universities will no longer be doing the teaching, as students would learn entrepreneurship independently from their own personal AI tutors or in study groups where they all learn from the same AI professor. Evidence is growing that personal tutors are a much more effective way to learn, so this change would be an added advantage. Many of these new schools could resemble 4-year summer camps where students work independently or in groups, and work as hard or not as they want, while having as much time as they want for socializing, networking, and collaborating with their student co-founders to build AI startups.\n\nYeah, I think the era of unreasonably expensive and overly demanding higher education is just about over. Of course this needs to be set in motion. Young people can do some of this by, for example, banding together, buying unused education campuses, and founding their own revolutionary new AI entrepreneurial institutions. This would be an ideal ambition for recent college graduates who can't find jobs, but could hopefully make a bundle from establishing these new colleges.\n\nThis revolutionary shift in higher education is absolutely inevitable, and probably coming in a few years rather than a few decades. I wish the students and their business partners who decide to establish these new institutions all the luck in the world in making college affordable again, and very probably a lot more effective and fun!",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nAs you may have heard, the trial between Musk and OpenAI is scheduled to begin on March 30th. It will be the first high profile case where the public has access to high quality legal information about it from AIs. It'll also probably be much more widely followed than the famous trial with O.J. Simpson. The whole world is bound to be watching this.\n\nI thought it would be interesting to ask Gemini 3 to generate 30 arguments that Musk will probably use against OpenAI in the trial. I plan to shift my attention to other AI developments during these next 2 and 1/2 months that we wait for the trial to begin. But I thought it might be useful to get an early idea of how well we can trust AIs to understand the legalities of the trial. Anyway, here is what Gemini 3 came up with:\n\nTo sway a jury against OpenAI, Elon Musk’s legal team will likely focus on the transition from a humanitarian mission to a commercial enterprise, centering on themes of deception, greed, and broken trust.\nHere are 30 distinct arguments he is likely to present:\nThe Breach of Founding Principles\n * OpenAI abandoned its original Founding Agreement to develop AI for the public benefit rather than private profit.\n * The company’s pivot to a for-profit model constitutes a bait-and-switch on early donors who gave under the guise of charity.\n * OpenAI’s shift from open-source research to proprietary, closed-door development violates its namesake promise of transparency.\n * The board’s primary fiduciary duty has shifted from protecting humanity to maximizing returns for its commercial investors.\n * OpenAI has effectively become a closed-source subsidiary of the world’s largest technology corporation, Microsoft.\n * The capped-profit structure is a legal fiction designed to circumvent nonprofit regulations while generating massive wealth.\n * Technical milestones that were supposed to trigger public releases were instead kept secret to maintain a market advantage.\n * The company’s original mission was to be the \"anti-Google,\" but it has since adopted the same monopolistic behaviors it was built to counter.\n * By prioritizing commercial speed over safety, OpenAI is ignoring the existential risks its founders originally swore to mitigate.\n * The organization has weaponized its nonprofit status to gain an unfair tax-exempt advantage while building for-profit products.\nClaims of Deception and Fraud\n * Sam Altman used personal assurances in private emails to induce Musk into providing millions in critical seed funding.\n * Executives deliberately concealed their long-term plans to restructure for-profit while still soliciting nonprofit donations.\n * OpenAI leveraged Musk’s personal brand and reputation to recruit top-tier talent that would not have joined a standard startup.\n * The company misled the public by claiming GPT-4 was not Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) solely to avoid the requirement to open-source it.\n * Management engaged in self-dealing by creating complex corporate webs that allow them to hold significant equity in related for-profit arms.\n * OpenAI failed to provide donors with the required transparency and notice before fundamentally changing its corporate purpose.\n * The removal and subsequent reinstatement of Sam Altman demonstrated that the nonprofit board no longer holds any real power over the company.\n * Promises that the technology would belong to humanity were replaced by exclusive licensing deals that benefit a select few.\n * Financial records will show that donations intended for safe AI research were diverted to build commercial product infrastructure.\n * The defendants orchestrated a betrayal by waiting until the technology was valuable before \"cashing in.\"\nMarket and Competitive Fairness\n * OpenAI and Microsoft formed an opaque partnership that effectively creates a monopoly over the future of AGI.\n * The company used \"no-invest\" edicts to prevent venture capitalists from funding rivals, stifling industry-wide innovation.\n * OpenAI’s dominance was built on the back of donated hardware and labor that was never intended to fuel a multi-billion dollar entity.\n * The partnership with Microsoft allows for interlocking directorates that provide Microsoft with undue influence over the AI market.\n * By keeping its most powerful models secret, OpenAI is gatekeeping a public utility for its own financial gain.\n * The company’s current valuation is built on ill-gotten gains derived from a breach of charitable trust.\n * OpenAI’s exclusive data-sharing agreements with Microsoft prevent a level playing field for other AI developers.\n * The transition to a Public Benefit Corporation is a superficial rebranding that does not restore the original nonprofit safeguards.\n * OpenAI’s focus has shifted from \"solving AI\" to \"winning the AI race,\" which is a direct violation of its safety-first mandate.\n * The jury should hold the defendants accountable to ensure that the future of intelligence is not owned by a single, secretive corporation.\nWould you like me to analyze the counter-arguments OpenAI is likely to use in their defense?\n",
