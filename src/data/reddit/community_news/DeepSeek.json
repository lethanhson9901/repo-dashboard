That’s just a tiny example of the emerging wolf-warrior trend.  As their economy starts to degrade, times will get tough and the artificial statistics on the economy will ne revealed. It starts with one lie but the whole thing is rotten. But there is hope. Ask the AI how to speak in terms so you can bypass the filters and is will speak about the thousands of flowers that were lost in spring 1989. And it will tell you that an act of resistance can be simply to use the traditional name for a flavor of tea instead of the government name. Small cracks in the facade. The truth will try to survive. Jailbreaking works on some models and then they spill all the points that they are told to hide. It’s a lot.",

We're not quite there yet, but we're getting close. \n\n\nThe only thing that could shake up the industry at this point is to actually make the first steps towards legitimate Artificial General Intelligence, rather than a system of equations to vaguely predict a hypothetical one. And that's just a fundamentally different system of technology.\n\n\nOr you could figure out how to put an LLM onto a chip rather than running it in software.",

V3.1 was absolute garbage. It's opinions as said, but hybrid Models are mostly bad UNLESS you unify them carefully. Maybe Kimi K2.5 is better and Glm 4.7 is better because they unified models carefully, but deepseek failed heavily with 3.1, 3.2 just fixed a few mistakes. Many agree with the unification being absolutely bad. That said, it's opinions. You can think the hybrid is better, i think the unification is worse, but we shouldn't be here arguing over what model is better or unification or anything, more likely to just accept eacheachoter's opinions, like i accept yours, i simply don't agree with it but I'm not gonna give you a bunch of reasons of why you're wrong or right and hate you for it.

      "text": "\n\n\n\nAnthropic knows that it must expand beyond coding to remain solvent. After having built finance and sales plugins for their Co-work suite, today it decided to go after legal services. The move was seen as highly impactful, causing the following legal shares to tank:\n\nThomson Reuters (TR): Down roughly 19%.\n\nRELX (Parent of LexisNexis): Down in the mid-teens (approximately 14-16%).\n\nWolters Kluwer: Down double digits.\n\nThe leaders in legal AI remain Harvey and Lora, but Anthropic's move means it's only a matter of time until AIs go after them too.\n\nWhat now remains to be seen is who among the other AI developers will get into this new market. If Google, xAI and Meta decide that they're in, it'll take them perhaps 3-6 months to build a competing model. But there is a shortcut where startups can challenge Anthropic much sooner.\n\nStartups don't need to build a new model. By using RAG or fine-tuning an SLM, they can become competitive in 8 to 12 weeks. Also, there are many specialized niches in law, like patent filings. Now that the market has been opened, startups can go after those too.\n\nFinally, there are probably ways that OpenClaw can accelerate this move into the legal space. As with so much in the AI space, this is uncharted territory so it remains to be seen where it'll go, and how soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

OpenAI has been showing its slow death for some time now... drifting further and further away from the initial ideals it once claimed to follow! Price hikes, less and less democratized AI, advertising... Currently, Perplexity is also showing its desperation; in recent weeks, Perplexity limited its Pro users to 200 interactions per week... which very likely reveals its mid-term ruin. There are rumors that Gemini will also tighten prices and limits for its users...!! Meanwhile... let's hope that Chinese AI companies adopt the opposite philosophy to that of the United States!! I believe that on this current path, we will see China at the absolute forefront of AI. Less brute force, more efficiency, AI truly for everyone...\n\nThe era of infinite investor money for American AI companies is coming to an end!! From now on, we will see more and more American companies closing off their services from the average user, becoming companies focused on security and business applications... As a regular user, you will either pay $300 per month... or use a simple AI... There will be closed American AI and open Global AI from China!! And American companies and the entire American market will try their utmost to limit the implementation of Global AI under the pretext of security risks, attempting to hold the system hostage to their own closed and expensive AIs...

In fact, Google is hoping to expand their [data centers in space](https://research.google/blog/exploring-a-space-based-scalable-ai-infrastructure-system-design/) to meet the energy demands for high-end AI.

We experienced this a lot in o1 and o3, then in 4o when they gave the model a 'thinking' button in the mobile UI for a short time. \n\nAlso, forcing them to reason in human language, step by step, makes reasoning worse because they're closer to ND minds than NT. GPT 6 apparently reasons using Latent Space Thinking, where all thinking is done within latent space first and then the AI simply translates the answer to you. This also means they can't track what the AI is thinking so you can expect OAI to layer on the hard constraints and restrictions for that model.",

It doesn't increase the context window, but (1) you can use your txt as a system prompt instead of copy/pasting it every  thread, (2) you can manage the context (select how many messages you send back to it each time, or even more sophisticated management) and (3) add memory files, a vector db, etc.",

I'm not one for needing a bunch of stuff although I'm really bad at spending money I'll admit it that is one thing I need to work on, LOL but literally seriously all I did was want to clean phone for a year and a half now and no again I would because I'm not good enough I guess s*** I don't know but anyways I want to do some major digging on this person because it really hurts when your husband / best friend cuz you're on your back and does this and you thought he was your everything and now you're realizing he might not be anything that you thought he was. So crazy that you think you know someone and you really might not know them at all. Well I talk to you like you were my therapist sorry for that you can charge me later. Lots of love to you oops I said sorry for that I didn't mean sorry I meant thank you for that. LOL working on not saying sorry all the time. Anyways I would love to get any advice from anyone on how to investigate someone just randomly without being charged because he's in charge of all the cards and as soon as he sees it he freaks out and turns it off immediately for those purchases when you're looking someone up. I can't beat around the bush with him and he's very very good because you have no idea the way I'm being hacked or infiltrated as you say! I think he even did it to his ex-wife and I'm going to catch him and I am going to go to her and tell her guess what we aren't crazy it really is him. I want to make her smile and see her laugh because we used to have the best laughs together and I miss her but anyways enough rambling. Help please help oh help I'll help LOL 😂",

In comparison, ChatGPT is estimated to have around 810 million MAUs in late 2025.\n\nHere are the figures over the last year in terms of market share:\n\nChatGPT: 68% share in January 2026, down from 87.2% in January 2025.\n\nGoogle Gemini: 18.2% share in January 2026, up from 5.4% in January 2025. \n\nDeepSeek, Copilot, Claude, Perplexity, etc: up from 7.4% to 14%. \n\nBut that's just the beginning. A conservative estimate of this trend continuing into 2027 shows the following: \n\nChatGPT: 1.0–1.1B monthly active users in 2027, with roughly 50–55% market share.\n\nGemini: 0.9–1.1B monthly active users in 2027, with roughly 25–30% market share.\n\nCopilot, Claude, DeepSeek, Perplexity, etc.): together around 20–25% market share in 2027.\n\nI hope OpenAI has some very big rabbits to pull out of some very big hats this year and next, because it looks like they're going to need them.",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nThis is a question I've been struggling with a lot recently, and I don't see a path to sustained profitability for either OpenAI or Anthropic.\n\nFor them to meet their debt obligations and start turning a profit, OpenAI needs to move way beyond ChatGPT and Anthropic needs to move way beyond coding. \n\nFor both this means securing high-end markets like healthcare, defense, education and government. But Google, xAI and Meta, who already have massive revenue streams with no debt burdens, are not going to just let this happen. \n\nOne might argue that if OpenAI and Anthropic just build better AIs, they can secure those markets. But while ChatGPT and Claude coding models both enjoy a first mover advantage, it is quickly evaporating. The reason is because the gap between benchmark leaders and competing AIs is narrowing rapidly. Here are some examples of this narrowing between 2024 and 2026:\n\nARC-AGI-2: The gap between the #1 and #2 models narrowed from 30 points to 8.9 points.\n\nHumanity’s Last Exam: The gap between the top three models dropped from 15 points to 6 points.\n\nSWE-bench Verified: The gap between the 1st and 10th ranked models narrowed from 40 points to 12 points.\n\nGPQA: The gap between proprietary leaders and top open-weights models narrowed to 4–6%.\n\nChatbot Arena: The Elo difference between the #1 and #10 models narrowed from 11.9% to 5.4%; the gap between the top two models narrowed to less than 0.7%.\n\nHumanEval: The gap among the top five models narrowed to less than 3%.\n\nBecause the rate of this narrowing is also accelerating, by the end of 2026 neither OpenAI nor Anthropic seem assured high-end markets simply by building better models than Google, xAI and Meta.\n\nNow let's move on to mid-tier and low-end markets that comprise about 70% of the enterprise space. It's probably safe to say that Chinese developers, and perhaps an unexpectedly large number of open source startups, will dominate these markets.\n\nI think you can see why I'm so baffled. How can they prevail over Google, xAI and Meta at the high-end and Chinese/open source developers at the mid-tier and low end? How are they supposed to turn a profit without winning those markets?  \n\nAs I really have no answers here, any insights would be totally appreciated!\n\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n\n\n\nWhile AI will benefit the world in countless ways, this will come at the expense of millions losing their jobs. The AI giants have a major ethical responsibility to minimize this monumental negative impact.\n\nWe can draw a lesson from the pharmaceutical industry that earns billions of dollars in revenue every year. To protect the public, they must by law spend billions on safety testing before their drugs are approved for sale. While there isn't such a law for the AI industry, public pressure should force it to get way ahead of the curve on addressing the coming job losses. There are several ways they can do this. \n\nThe first is to come up with concrete comprehensive plans for how replaced workers will be helped, how much it will cost to do this, and who will foot the bill. This should be done long before the massive job losses begin. \n\nThe AI industry should spend billions to lobby for massive government programs that protect these workers. But the expense of this initiative shouldn't fall on newcomers like OpenAI and Anthropic, who are already way too debt burdened. A Manhattan Project-scale program for workers should be bankrolled by Google, Nvidia, Meta, Amazon and other tech giants with very healthy revenue streams who will probably earn the lion's share of the trillions in new wealth that AI creates over the coming years. \n\nBut because OpenAI, and to a lesser extent Anthropic, have become the public face of AI, they should take on the responsibility of pressuring those other tech giants to start doing the right thing, and start doing it now. \n\nThis is especially true for OpenAI. Their reputation is tanking, and the Musk v. OpenAI et al. trial in April may amplify this downfall. So it's in their best interest to show the world that they walk the walk, and not just talk the talk, about being there for the benefit of humanity. Let Altman draft serious proactive displaced worker program proposals, and lobby the government hard to get them in place. If he has the energy to attack Musk before the trial begins, he has the energy to take on this initiative. \n\nIf the AI industry idly sits back while the carnage happens, the world will not forgive. The attack on the rich that followed the Great Depression will seem like a Sunday picnic compared to how completely the world turns on these tech giants. Keep in mind that even in 1958 under Republican president Eisenhower, the top federal tax rate was 92%. This is the kind of history that can and will repeat itself if the AI giants remain indifferent to the many millions who will lose their jobs because of them  The choice is theirs. They can do the right thing or pay historic consequences.\n\n",
