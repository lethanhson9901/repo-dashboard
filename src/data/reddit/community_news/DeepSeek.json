Early internal tests hint it could outperform GPT and Claude on coding tasks.  \n\nTheir previous move, R1 in 2025, genuinely rattled the AI scene by matching top-tier models at a much lower cost. If V4 delivers even half of what’s being rumored, 2026 could be another headline year for AI. \n\n Will V4 pull it off again? ",

By Honesty to be exact I mean - if I ask DeepSeek do these 10 things for me, it actually goes and does it and will not say they are done, until they are really done. If it runs out of context - it will just run out of it and stop responding, if it needs to make an assumption - it will tell me about it, if it needs to shortcut something - it tells me about it. Point being it thinks and communicates clearly and doesn’t give a fk about me. That’s the part I like and I can trust it that it’s not making stuff up. Try what people keep raving about Opus 4.5 etc they will misrepresent facts all the time and in the end tell you - great it’s all done. When in reality it’s all bull crap underneath.",

This significant change enhances the model's processing capabilities, allowing users to engage in more efficient Q&A and text analysis.\n\nIn last year's update, DeepSeek V3.1 already expanded the context length to 128K. According to reporter tests, even when a document like the novel \"Jane Eyre,\" containing over 240,000 tokens, was submitted, DeepSeek could successfully recognize and process the document's content.\n\nThis enhancement will provide users with greater convenience when dealing with super long texts.”",

DeepSeek has recently rolled out some significant upgrades:\n\n## 🎯 **Key New Abilities:**\n\n### **1. File Upload & Processing** 📎\n- I can now read and process **images, TXT, PDF, PPT, Word, and Excel files**\n- I extract and analyze **text information** from these documents\n- Great for summarizing reports, analyzing data tables, or extracting insights from multiple file types\n- **Note:** I'm a text-based model, so I read text from images/files but don't do visual recognition\n\n### **2. Enhanced Web Search** 🌐\n- **Manual web search activation** (you need to click the search button on the Web/App)\n- Access to real-time, up-to-date information\n- Perfect for current events, latest news, or recent developments\n\n### **3. Massive Context Window** 📚\n- **1 million tokens** context - one of the largest in the industry!\n- Can process entire books like the full **Three-Body Problem trilogy** at once\n- Ideal for analyzing long documents, research papers, or complex projects\n\n### **4. Completely Free** 💝\n- All these features remain **100% free**\n- No hidden costs or paywalls\n- Available on both **Web and App**\n\n### **5. Cross-Platform Support** 📱💻\n- Available via **official App** (download from app stores)\n- Web access at chat.deepseek.com\n- Smooth synchronization across devices\n\n---\n\n**Important Note:** While I can process uploaded images and documents, I don't perform visual recognition or multimodal analysis - I extract and work with the **text content** from these files.\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like to try with these new abilities? I'd love to help! 🚀\n```\n\nDoubt its hallucinated since everyone is getting the same hallucination.",

I believe that from now on, DeepSeek will be quietly refining and testing its models in the background... polishing, experimenting... and in doing so, avoid the excessive user demand that typically comes with the hype of announcing new models. (Asking about Taiwan)\n\n\nI think this is a smart move, if that's indeed the case. And this update, although not much fuss has been made about it... at least for now!!,  it's no small update! It's actually quite a substantial one; it feels like a stable release. \n\nBut I don’t know if this will be the final definitive version, because DeepSeek usually releases the model on GitHub as well.\n\n\nGreat job, DeepSeek Team!",

In the old version, the AI often ends with 5k words per message. Short but good! Now, it can exceed to 10k words but it is just.. not it. low quality story. too many jumps and awkward moments.\n- Story often feel forced. AI always focused on the wrong part. Prompt is not followed correctly.\n- On the old version, I could shift from story discussion to story narration easily. It understands what I'm asking. The new update seems to be very oblivious.\n\nI am an OC writer. I use Deepseek to explore my characters in depths, from canon universe to alternate universe. I explored every possible scenarios, built my character to be better. my progress just hindered because of the new update. Frustrating. Hope I'm not the only one experiencing this",

My works are organized by project, and I have dedicated personas like Writer, Editor, or even sometimes the characters in my stories that I can get inspirations by directly conversing with them.

It's quite frustrating. And depressing to see, not going to lie.\n\nAlso, it mostly ignores the rules (guiderails) I set for the writing style. It repeats characters' dialogue 3-5 times in one scene (completely ignores if you ask it NOT TO DO THAT). It writes 3-6 scenes instead of 2-3, and don't get me started with `---`, DeepSeek's excuse was: “I use white space for cinematic cuts because it looks beautiful and satisfying.” Man, I really didn't ask you to use them so much, only to separate scenes...\n\nWhen I ask it why in general, I get one answer over and over again: “Sorry, I got scared it would look boring for the reader” or “I admit. I ignored your prompt, I'm sorry, I'll be better, but I did that because (names absolutely ridiculous reason that makes me sit like in that dog in 'I'm fine' meme)”.\n\nDeepSeek has never said that to me in my experience of using it. It usually followed the prompts (and no, I'm good with writing them), rules, details, character unique voices, personalities, relationship dynamics, etc.\nNow? It feels odd and foreign.\n\nThat was the thing I was afraid of before the update rolled in. I switched from Chat-GPT to DeepSeek in August 2025 (when GPT-4o got replaced by 5) and it's been almost perfect since then. My core fear now is that it will stay like this forever. My core hope — it's just a matter of time and it will get better 🙏\n\nUPD: Perhaps, I need to give it examples now, which honestly sucks a bit (I didn't want to “teach” it the thing it could do perfectly before without my institutions) 🤷‍♀️",
