Peter Steinberger has shown that a single person, as a hobby, can advance AI just as powerfully as the AI Giants do. Perhaps more than anything this shows how in the AI space there are no moats!\n\nHere's some of how big it is:\n\nIn just two days its open-source repository at GitHub got massive attention with tens of thousands stars gained in a single day and over 100,000 total stars so far, becoming perhaps the fastest-growing project in GitHub history, \n\nMoltbot became a paradigm-shifting, revolutionary personal AI agent because it 1) runs locally, 2) executes real tasks instead of just answering queries, and 3) gives users much more privacy and control over automation. \n\nIt moves AI from locked-down, vendor-owned tools toward personal AI operators, changing the AI landscape at the most foundational level.\n\nHere's an excellent YouTube interview of Steinberger that provides a lot of details about what went into the project and what Moltbot can do.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qyjTpzIAEkA?si=4kFIuvtFcVHoVlHT",

The leaked code reveals fundamental architectural changes including 512-dimensional attention heads, mixed-precision sparse computing, NVIDIA Blackwell GPU optimization, and innovative memory mechanisms. With 28 references to “MODEL1” across 114 files appearing as an independent branch alongside existing models, this represents a comprehensive architectural overhaul rather than an incremental update—and it's generating unprecedented global anticipation.",

V3.1 was absolute garbage. It's opinions as said, but hybrid Models are mostly bad UNLESS you unify them carefully. Maybe Kimi K2.5 is better and Glm 4.7 is better because they unified models carefully, but deepseek failed heavily with 3.1, 3.2 just fixed a few mistakes. Many agree with the unification being absolutely bad. That said, it's opinions. You can think the hybrid is better, i think the unification is worse, but we shouldn't be here arguing over what model is better or unification or anything, more likely to just accept eacheachoter's opinions, like i accept yours, i simply don't agree with it but I'm not gonna give you a bunch of reasons of why you're wrong or right and hate you for it.

      "text": "\n\n\n\nIdeally, along with discovering new medicines, materials and processes, and boosting economic productivity, most of us hope that AI will bring our world closer together. The theory behind this is simple. When resources are abundant, nations stop fighting over them. When people have more than they need, they stop fighting other people over what they don't have. \n\nBut Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, is actively promoting a different vision. He is pushing an \"entente\" strategy where democratic nations use advanced AI systems in military applications to achieve  decisive dominance over everyone else. In other words, he is trying to start an AI military arms race where a group of select \"democratic\" countries have unrivaled dictatorial control.\n\nThe main flaw in this dangerous initiative is that he doesn't understand the difference between what democracy sounds like on paper and how democracy is practiced in the real world. Let's take the US as an example. Ostensibly we are a democracy, but our politics tell a much different story. \n\nIn the 2024 election cycle, total spending reached an estimated $15.9 billion. A small \"donor class\"of 100 wealthy families contributed a staggering $2.6 billion during that cycle. This concentration of funding allows affluent individuals to essentially decide what happens in elections. Here's more evidence.\n\nOver 65% of funding for federal races now comes from PACs and large donors. Studies show that when the preferences of the bottom 90% of earners are different than those of the economic elite, the elite’s preferences are roughly twice as likely to be enacted into law. \n\nSo when the US does virtually nothing to fight climate change, when the\ntop 10% of earners capture approximately 45% to 50% of all of the national income, when we elect a megalomaniac president who wants to annex Canada, invade Greenland, and basically install himself as the dictator of the world, it doesn't take advanced AI to figure out how this all happened.\n\nThe problem with American democracy, which is functionally a plutocracy, is that the money that controls the American government is working on behalf of a very small group of rich stakeholders. In other words, its main concern is neither the welfare of the country nor the welfare of the world. Its main concern is increasing the profits of the people whose money already almost completely controls the entire political system.\n\nSo when Amadei talks about democracy ruling the world, what he really means is the ultra-rich in control of everything. When he refers to non-Democratic countries, he's primarily referring to China. Yes, China's government is no more democratic than ours. But there's a major difference. The Chinese government works for the benefit of the Chinese people, not for the benefit of the Chinese elite. Not only has China lifted 800 million of its citizens from poverty within a time frame that makes the rest of the world green with envy, it is aggressively pursuing a policy to lift the rest of the world from poverty. \n\nNow contrast this with Trump's \"America First\" doctrine where it doesn't matter how poor and powerless our economic programs make other countries as long as America, more specifically America's rich class, comes out on top.\n\nAmodei is THE poster boy for why some of us are afraid of AI going dangerously wrong. His academic training is in biophysics, specifically in electrophysiology of neural circuits. No training in political science. No training in economics. No training in international affairs. He arrogantly believes that being the CEO of an AI company endows him with the knowledge and wisdom to know what's best for the world. But his current project to promote a global AI military arms race where every country competes for hegemonic dominance shows not only how misguided, but also how threatening, he is.\n\nI'm not echoing a minority opinion. Here is how others have been reacting to Amodei's dystopian dream. \n\nYann LeCun:\n\n\"Altman, Hassabis, and Amodei are the ones doing massive corporate lobbying at the moment... [Amodei] could be suffering from a huge superiority complex, believing only he is enlightened enough to have access to AI, but the unwashed masses are too stupid or immoral to use such a powerful tool.\"\n\nMarc Andreessen, in a critique of the \"doomer\" philosophy shared by Amodei, stated: \"Restricting AI is like restricting math, software, and chips... the idea that we should prevent the development of a technology that could save lives because of a 'cult-like' obsession with imaginary risks is a recipe for a new form of totalitarianism.\"\n\nDavid Sacks responded to Anthropic's policy positions by stating that the company has been pushing a \"sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering\" to protect its market position under the guise of safety.\n\nIt would be unquestionably in the best interest of the AI space and the rest of the world if Amodei would limit himself to building coding AI, and leave the engineering of a new global order to people who actually understand the geopolitics and economics of the world.\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nOpenAI wants you to believe that they are too important to the AI space and to the world to be allowed to fail. They have conjured what they hope will be a self-fulfilling prophecy intended to have American taxpayers bail them out if they do not meet their debt obligations. The threat is so real that yesterday Senator Warren sent Altman a letter demanding assurances that they would NOT seek a government bailout if they ultimately failed to turn a profit.\n\nhttps://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-presses-openai-ceo-on-spending-commitments-and-bailout-requests-after-cfo-suggests-government-backstop\n\nAnd the facts and figures don't substantiate any kind of rescue narrative.\n\nLet's first understand why OpenAI is no longer necessary to the AI space today. When they launched ChatGPT-3.5 in November 2022, one might have said that back then they were extremely helpful to attracting hundreds of billions of dollars to the AI space over the subsequent years. But that happened over 3 years ago. Both introducing AI to the world and creating a huge demand for investment in the space are tasks that have already been accomplished.\n\nIf they were to cease to exist tomorrow, there would be no great AI bubble burst. The $1.4 trillion, (and counting) in investment commitments that they pulled together would simply move to their competitors. If Google, Anthropic, xAI and a rapidly growing number of Chinese open source and proprietary AI developers didn't exist, this might not be the case. But they do, and there's nothing that OpenAI has done that these other AI developers cannot already do as well, and often at a fraction of the cost.\n\nNow let's turn to OpenAI's financials. They boast over 900 million weekly ChatGPT users. But only 5% are paid subscribers. Worse yet, their paid subscriptions plateaued in June of 2025. The problem for OpenAI is that 55 to 60% of their revenue comes from ChatGPT. And despite having earned $20 billion in revenue in 2025, OpenAI's expenses that year exceeded $29 billion. Now also keep in mind that their competitors' models are already on par with or surpass GPT 5.2 on the AI benchmarks most important to both consumer and enterprise markets.\n\nLet's consider what they must do to meet their debt obligations. Altman set a target for OpenAI to exceed $100 billion in annual revenue by 2027. But because they are currently earning only $20 billion they would need to increase that income by at least 5x just to meet debt obligations that come due in 2027. And keep in mind that they set this revenue target at a time when the healthcare and other AI products they must sell to meet it have not even been built. More ominous is that their competitors, including Chinese open source developers, are strongly positioned to outcompete them in virtually every product category. But they didn't factor in this competition in their 2027 projections.\n\nAll of that is actually somewhat of an aside. If OpenAI were to cease to exist tomorrow, their competitors would quickly and seamlessly capture their revenue-generating markets. Their absence would cause no shortage of AI services or products. They offer no unique product that their competitors have not already built. They have no special patents that provide them with a moat. They are simply no longer necessary to the AI space because their competitors can do everything that they do, and often at far less cost. \n\nSo don't let OpenAI tell you that they are necessary to the AI space. Neither they, nor Google, nor Anthropic, nor the Chinese developers, are necessary to advancing AI because there are now so many companies building models. The space will continue to expand and become increasingly lucrative for decades to come regardless of who is in the game.\n\n",

They use \"ChatGPT\" because of its name... and because they still don't know about other models. \n\n\nAnd there is another phenomenon I'm noticing, which by 2026 will become much more evident to more people: in some cases, Chinese models are already better than American ones. And those who don't use them do so out of pure prejudice or also due to a certain degree of \"inexperience.\"",

Doesn’t seem like so.\n\nWhat I want is some most optimized model for 8gb size and unfortunately it doesn’t seem that is the case for deepseek, they don’t optimize for mass consumer this much, they try to compete in servers rather than individual consumers with home cards.\n\nThey did a great job though, they’re best in their niche, just not in the 8-gb video cards niche.",

      "text": "I’ve been reflecting a lot lately on the current state of DeepSeek, and I wanted to share some personal observations to see if the community feels the same way.\n\nFor a long time, I considered DeepSeek a true pioneer. It was the \"gold standard\" for me a free, highly capable model that felt genuinely uncensored, especially when compared to the heavy-handed guardrails of Western models like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. At its peak, it didn't just compete; it often outperformed them in terms of raw utility and creative freedom.\n\nHowever, recently, I’ve noticed a disappointing shift. The latest versions and updates feel like a step backward rather than the leap forward we were all expecting. Specifically:\n\n1. **Increased Censorship:** The model has become significantly more restrictive. Responses that used to be nuanced and direct are now frequently hit by \"policy\" filters or generic refusals.\n2. **Degradation in Quality:** There’s a noticeable dip in the \"intelligence\" of the outputs. It feels less sharp and more prone to generic or repetitive answers.\n3. **A Broader Trend:** This doesn't seem isolated to DeepSeek. I’ve noticed similar patterns with Alibaba’s models and even Kimi (though Kimi still holds up relatively well).\n\nIt feels like something fundamental has changed behind closed doors regarding strategy or regulatory compliance in China. It’s disheartening because DeepSeek was my go-to daily driver. Now, I find myself using it and even Qwen only occasionally, as they no longer provide that \"limitless\" edge they once had.\n\nI want to stay optimistic about the next rumored release, but given the current trajectory, I’m starting to have my doubts.\n\n**What are your thoughts?** Have you noticed a decline in output quality or a \"tightening\" of the filters recently? Is the era of the \"uncensored\" Chinese powerhouse model coming to an end, or is this just a temporary roadblock?\n\nCurious to hear your experiences.",

Recently, I've gotten responses from both ChatGPT and Gemini that a question was basically too difficult. What was strange is that Claude and Copilot were able to answer those questions with no problem, and sometimes ChatGPT can answer something Gemini can't. One example of a Gemini fail was comparing the features of five Canon imageClass printers that were similar models. MF743Cdw and the like. I was looking for basic information, like one or two paper trays, support for faxing, double-sided scanning, etc. I didn't think it was a heavy lift.\n\nChatGPT, when I ask about other electronics, will rephrase my question as a statement and direct me to the website where I can do my own research. Please. I'm asking AI because I don't have the bandwidth to do the legwork myself. That's what I've been doing my whole life. Lol\n\nPersonally, I'm afraid of sponsored answers in the name of capitalism, corruption to protect people in power and their wealthy donors, censorship in the name of safety, and other such things that mask or distort the truth. It seems the safest approach is to be skeptical and verify any critical research with other sources.",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nThis is a question I've been struggling with a lot recently, and I don't see a path to sustained profitability for either OpenAI or Anthropic.\n\nFor them to meet their debt obligations and start turning a profit, OpenAI needs to move way beyond ChatGPT and Anthropic needs to move way beyond coding. \n\nFor both this means securing high-end markets like healthcare, defense, education and government. But Google, xAI and Meta, who already have massive revenue streams with no debt burdens, are not going to just let this happen. \n\nOne might argue that if OpenAI and Anthropic just build better AIs, they can secure those markets. But while ChatGPT and Claude coding models both enjoy a first mover advantage, it is quickly evaporating. The reason is because the gap between benchmark leaders and competing AIs is narrowing rapidly. Here are some examples of this narrowing between 2024 and 2026:\n\nARC-AGI-2: The gap between the #1 and #2 models narrowed from 30 points to 8.9 points.\n\nHumanity’s Last Exam: The gap between the top three models dropped from 15 points to 6 points.\n\nSWE-bench Verified: The gap between the 1st and 10th ranked models narrowed from 40 points to 12 points.\n\nGPQA: The gap between proprietary leaders and top open-weights models narrowed to 4–6%.\n\nChatbot Arena: The Elo difference between the #1 and #10 models narrowed from 11.9% to 5.4%; the gap between the top two models narrowed to less than 0.7%.\n\nHumanEval: The gap among the top five models narrowed to less than 3%.\n\nBecause the rate of this narrowing is also accelerating, by the end of 2026 neither OpenAI nor Anthropic seem assured high-end markets simply by building better models than Google, xAI and Meta.\n\nNow let's move on to mid-tier and low-end markets that comprise about 70% of the enterprise space. It's probably safe to say that Chinese developers, and perhaps an unexpectedly large number of open source startups, will dominate these markets.\n\nI think you can see why I'm so baffled. How can they prevail over Google, xAI and Meta at the high-end and Chinese/open source developers at the mid-tier and low end? How are they supposed to turn a profit without winning those markets?  \n\nAs I really have no answers here, any insights would be totally appreciated!\n\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nFirst, I've limited this to OpenAI and Anthropic, not including Google or xAI, because the latter have revenue streams that let them navigate the next few years without the cash crunch that the former will face because of their huge debt burdens.\n\nTheir competition will not come from Google and xAI, who will be facing the exact same monumental headwinds over the next few years. Their competition will come from open source and Chinese developers who will flood the market with small, dedicated, much less expensive models. \n\nThe reasoning for this is obvious. Let's say your company needed some accounting services. Would you obtain them from a small accounting firm who just does accounting, and so does it very well? Or would you obtain them from a large corporate conglomerate that markets every conceivable product like healthcare, scientific discovery, building construction, restaurant services, and lawn care?\n\nThis analogy highlights the all-important difference between LLMs that do everything and SLMs that do just one thing, but do it very well. To dominate the enterprise space, Open source and Chinese developers will be building very small language models for very specific niche business tasks that run locally at a fraction of the cost of LLMs.\n\nYou might be asking why OpenAI and Anthropic can't market their own competitive SLMs. The answer to this is simple. There are many thousands of these specific narrow domain business tasks that SLMs will be built to excel at, and the bloated bureaucracies that come with being a major developer like OpenAI and Anthropic render such an ambition a virtually impossible logistical nightmare. \n\nTo better illustrate this, here are some examples of the kinds of business departments within which these specific tasks are performed; human resources, finance and accounting, operations, sales, marketing, information technology, customer service, R&D, legal and compliance and supply chain and logistics.\n\nBut that's just the beginning. Taking finance and accounting as an example, here are some of the more specific tasks within those departments that SLMs will be built to perform; invoice data extraction, transaction categorization, bank reconciliation matching, expense report auditing, duplicate payment detection, purchase order matching, regulatory compliance monitoring, and it goes on and on.\n\nWhy can't LLMs perform all of those very specific tasks as well as SLMs? There are many reasons. Here are just a few of the advantages that SLMs offer; lower latency and faster processing, reduced computational and operational costs, higher accuracy through specialized fine-tuning, enhanced data privacy and local deployment options, lower energy consumption and infrastructure requirements.\n\nYou probably now understand why it would be virtually impossible for OpenAI and Anthropic to compete with SLMs on these multitude of very specific business use cases. \n\nIt is because the AI giants can't possibly market LLMs to compete in all of these very specific business use cases that over the next 2 years there will be an explosion of lean open source and Chinese startups that will build SLMs dedicated to doing one specific business task exceptionally well at a very low cost. \n\nWhat can the AI giants do, if anything, to become competitive in this emerging narrow domain enterprise space? That is the trillion dollar question before them.\n\n \n\n\n\n",

I find I'm frustrated with Claude so much less than any other model. That alone is worth an extra $100/mo for me. \n\nWith the ammount of value you can get out of AI, if you are doing that highly profitable, having the best AI models that have a full suite of services that are integrated like Claude Cowork are totally worth it.",

I think politics have made people a bit afraid of the Chinese recently, but ultimately higher ROIs will replace that distrust.
