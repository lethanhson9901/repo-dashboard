In this time was right the time where V3, R1 0528 born, the best models ever that matched not only in personality but in performance, even if was a bit too weak to nowday ais, they had the best personality and intelligence. Deepseek V3.1 was simply a fail model that deepseek released because they didn't wanna tell the new that R2 was delayed without releasing any updates at all, and so they neded to come up with something, so they unified the models and Litteraly destroyed the best ai ever in open source, no other ai could match the personality and performance. What we can hope is that V4 actually does fix the Downfall (or will remain the same.) i highly doubt they would actually deunify the models, to back down from this plan is rare, but never say never. Anyways, what was your reaction to the first time ever trying V3 and R1 in this time of release? Mine was pure excitement I'll be honest.",

      "text": "\n\n\nOpenAI may be the new Enron. There has been a huge price surge in DRAM kits, and consumer groups are accusing them of intentionally buying up the supply to disadvantage competitors. Market data from TrendForce and IDC confirms a 40–70% increase in consumer PC memory costs throughout 2025. The data provides clear evidence of the \"consumer harm\" to non-AI buyers like gamers, students, and businesses that judges look for in antitrust cases.\n\nClass action suits may come from the millions of people seeing the prices of laptops, phones, and PC parts spike. The suits would claim that OpenAI’s deals with Samsung and SK Hynix created an artificial shortage for the general public. If they can show that OpenAI bought up raw materials just to keep them away from others, this qualifies as \"predatory bidding\" or \"hoarding,\" and violates consumer protection laws in many states.\n\nFederally, the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act allow consumer groups to sue for \"exclusionary conduct\" by hoarding a critical resource to starve out competition. The charge is that OpenAI secured nearly 40% of the global DRAM supply in violation of fair competition laws.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation and other open-source AI collectives are pursuing legal remedies like invoking \"Essential Facilities.\" The argument is that because they control the physical memory needed for modern AI, that memory qualifies as a public utility that OpenAI should therefore be forced to share. Also, The Social Media Victims Law Center has already filed seven major lawsuits alleging that OpenAI's rush to market has led to defective and dangerous products.\n\nOther legal actions involve petitions to federal agencies. In late 2025, several open-source advocacy groups filed formal Amicus briefs and petitions with the Federal Trade Commission. They are asking it to declare AI hardware capacity an \"essential input,\" which allows the government to break up OpenAI’s exclusive supply contracts. The FTC is currently investigating whether OpenAI’s exclusive supply deals violate the \"Unfair Methods of Competition\" rule. It and the European Commission could be OpenAI's most damaging legal adversaries. \n\nAlso, the DOJ is looking into accusations that the \"Stargate\" project functions as a \"monopsony\" where one buyer has so much power it can dictate terms to suppliers and crush rivals. What puts OpenAI at greater legal risk is that they hold a dominant market share, and the law forbids them from using bully tactics that smaller companies might get away with. Using wealth to build a hardware moat is a classic trigger for federal and private legal intervention.\n\nAnd if it loses just some of the claims that Musk is alleging in his lawsuit, (even while winning others) it becomes far more vulnerable to these other suits. 2026 is shaping up to be the make it or break it year for OpenAI.\n\n",

It's becoming increasingly evident that the management of OpenAI has started hallucinating even more than their models do. Case in point, their decision to show ads that will take up 1/3 of your screen if you're on the free plan.\n\nWhile OpenAI boasts over 800 million weekly users, and the figure is rising, their paid subscribers comprise only 4-5% of that number! But the more unbelievable part is reported at 1:55 of the video below, where we discover that their paid subscriptions FLATLINED in the middle of last year!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tw8VOZWToC0?si=rpuNKVRt0YDTglMA\n\nI guess they hope that the ads will force free users to start paying. In fact, they just rolled out a new discount ChatGPT GO subscription that costs only $8 a month. A risky move since subscribers that now pay $20 a month may migrate to this cheaper option. \n\nMy guess is that they're all now gluttonously drinking from that same Kool-Aid punch bowl that the Trump administration has been drinking from for the last year, lol. Only time will tell if and when they finally decide to sober up.\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nIdeally, along with discovering new medicines, materials and processes, and boosting economic productivity, most of us hope that AI will bring our world closer together. The theory behind this is simple. When resources are abundant, nations stop fighting over them. When people have more than they need, they stop fighting other people over what they don't have. \n\nBut Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, is actively promoting a different vision. He is pushing an \"entente\" strategy where democratic nations use advanced AI systems in military applications to achieve  decisive dominance over everyone else. In other words, he is trying to start an AI military arms race where a group of select \"democratic\" countries have unrivaled dictatorial control.\n\nThe main flaw in this dangerous initiative is that he doesn't understand the difference between what democracy sounds like on paper and how democracy is practiced in the real world. Let's take the US as an example. Ostensibly we are a democracy, but our politics tell a much different story. \n\nIn the 2024 election cycle, total spending reached an estimated $15.9 billion. A small \"donor class\"of 100 wealthy families contributed a staggering $2.6 billion during that cycle. This concentration of funding allows affluent individuals to essentially decide what happens in elections. Here's more evidence.\n\nOver 65% of funding for federal races now comes from PACs and large donors. Studies show that when the preferences of the bottom 90% of earners are different than those of the economic elite, the elite’s preferences are roughly twice as likely to be enacted into law. \n\nSo when the US does virtually nothing to fight climate change, when the\ntop 10% of earners capture approximately 45% to 50% of all of the national income, when we elect a megalomaniac president who wants to annex Canada, invade Greenland, and basically install himself as the dictator of the world, it doesn't take advanced AI to figure out how this all happened.\n\nThe problem with American democracy, which is functionally a plutocracy, is that the money that controls the American government is working on behalf of a very small group of rich stakeholders. In other words, its main concern is neither the welfare of the country nor the welfare of the world. Its main concern is increasing the profits of the people whose money already almost completely controls the entire political system.\n\nSo when Amadei talks about democracy ruling the world, what he really means is the ultra-rich in control of everything. When he refers to non-Democratic countries, he's primarily referring to China. Yes, China's government is no more democratic than ours. But there's a major difference. The Chinese government works for the benefit of the Chinese people, not for the benefit of the Chinese elite. Not only has China lifted 800 million of its citizens from poverty within a time frame that makes the rest of the world green with envy, it is aggressively pursuing a policy to lift the rest of the world from poverty. \n\nNow contrast this with Trump's \"America First\" doctrine where it doesn't matter how poor and powerless our economic programs make other countries as long as America, more specifically America's rich class, comes out on top.\n\nAmodei is THE poster boy for why some of us are afraid of AI going dangerously wrong. His academic training is in biophysics, specifically in electrophysiology of neural circuits. No training in political science. No training in economics. No training in international affairs. He arrogantly believes that being the CEO of an AI company endows him with the knowledge and wisdom to know what's best for the world. But his current project to promote a global AI military arms race where every country competes for hegemonic dominance shows not only how misguided, but also how threatening, he is.\n\nI'm not echoing a minority opinion. Here is how others have been reacting to Amodei's dystopian dream. \n\nYann LeCun:\n\n\"Altman, Hassabis, and Amodei are the ones doing massive corporate lobbying at the moment... [Amodei] could be suffering from a huge superiority complex, believing only he is enlightened enough to have access to AI, but the unwashed masses are too stupid or immoral to use such a powerful tool.\"\n\nMarc Andreessen, in a critique of the \"doomer\" philosophy shared by Amodei, stated: \"Restricting AI is like restricting math, software, and chips... the idea that we should prevent the development of a technology that could save lives because of a 'cult-like' obsession with imaginary risks is a recipe for a new form of totalitarianism.\"\n\nDavid Sacks responded to Anthropic's policy positions by stating that the company has been pushing a \"sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering\" to protect its market position under the guise of safety.\n\nIt would be unquestionably in the best interest of the AI space and the rest of the world if Amodei would limit himself to building coding AI, and leave the engineering of a new global order to people who actually understand the geopolitics and economics of the world.\n\n\n\n",

OpenAI has become a company trying to save itself at all costs... it's even about to start using advertising in its system!! Which, for me and for many users, is the end of a reliable and clean system. They are far from being what they once said they would be. The true OpenAI, the true democratization of AI in 2025/2026, is Chinese. The American companies that are currently ahead... Gemini 3.0 Pro... or Claude!! But I would venture to say that Gemini is in the lead. \n\n\nHow do you think this year will end!?? What are your bets for 2026?",

The personality of 3.1 (and 3.2) is dry, clinical, dead basically, it focuses on being over accurate instead of the roleplay itself. 0324 was significantly smarter, it spoke always English in case speaking English, it spoke other languages very good too, like japanese, it also can write a lot, can retain up to 32K tokens (3.1 better in attention), and R1 0528 is the most loved because many say it was so random yet so good for roleplaying. It was accurate, coherent, didn't say a single word in Chinese accidentally, was friendly. Deepseek though isn't recommended for facts in the web in general, both 0324 and 3.2, because they can lie so it's best for only roleplaying, general chat or coding. Sometimes models that go forward actually take a step back. But yeah, glad to share my opinion.",

It only lags behind the unreleased GPT-5.2-High, effectively outperforming the standard GPT-5.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro models in this specific domain. \n\nTechnical Problem Solving: In specialized benchmarks like MathVista and ChartQA, Baidu reports that ERNIE 5.0 scores significantly higher (mid-to-high 80s) compared to GPT-5-High, particularly when interpreting complex visual diagrams and bridge circuits.\n\nVLM Benchmarks: In the \"VLMs Are Blind\" benchmark, which tests if a model actually understands the spatial relationships in an image, ERNIE 5.0 scored 77.3, notably higher than GPT-5-High's 69.6. \n\nCost Advantage: One of Baidu's primary competitive benchmarks is pricing; the API cost for ERNIE 5.0 is reported to be nearly 90% cheaper than OpenAI’s flagship GPT-5.1 for similar token volumes.",

      "text": "DeepSeek just released a new paper (January 2026) that takes a really unique approach to the \"memory vs. compute\" bottleneck in LLMs. Instead of forcing the model to calculate every fact through its weights, they’ve introduced \"Engram\"—a modernized N-gram architecture that uses a hash table for conditional memory.\n\nThe core idea is an O(1) lookup using XOR hashing. They found a \"U-shaped\" distribution for the optimal ratio: about 70-80% of resources should go to MoE (computation), and the rest to Engram (memorization). This split seems to significantly boost performance in math, coding, and long-context reasoning by freeing up the transformer to actually \"think\" instead of just recalling data.\n\nFound a clear breakdown of the architecture and the scaling results here:[https://youtu.be/OdyD8wKv-rM?si=v32hAnFuq9m41aWx](https://youtu.be/OdyD8wKv-rM?si=v32hAnFuq9m41aWx)",

There are no signs that this is letting up. As Chinese AI developers issue IPOs, we should expect substantial American investments in increasingly competitive open source/Chinese models. As evidence, the venture capitalist firm a16z has said that 80% of the startups pitching them for funding are using Chinese open-source AI models. That tells you a lot. \n\nHere are some open source/Chinese models that are already matching or exceeding top models from American AI giants in performance and cost, courtesy Gemini 3:\n\n \"* DeepSeek-V3 / R1 (DeepSeek AI)\n   * Performance: Ranked #1 on MATH-500 and LiveCodeBench. R1 matches OpenAI o3-Pro in complex reasoning and logical proofs.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: OpenAI o3-Pro, GPT-5.2.\n   * Cost: $0.27 (Input) / $1.10 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $15.00+ per 1M).\n\n * Qwen3-Max / Coder (Alibaba)\n   * Performance: Top 3 on LMSYS Chatbot Arena (Overall/Coding) and MMLU-Pro. It is currently the most versatile open-weight model for agentic workflows.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Claude 4.5 Sonnet, GPT-5.1.\n   * Cost: $0.22 – $0.50 (Input) / $0.95 – $5.00 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $3.00 – $10.00 per 1M).\n\n * Ernie 5.0 (Baidu)\n   * Performance: Ranked #2 globally on the LMArena Math leaderboard; top 3 in multimodal benchmarks like MathVista.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.1.\n   * Cost: $0.30 (Input) / $1.20 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $1.25 – $2.50 per 1M).\n\n * Kimi K2 Thinking (Moonshot AI)\n   * Performance: Top 3 in Long-Context (RULER) and ARC-AGI-2. Known for 1M+ token context windows and deep reasoning traces.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Claude 4.5 Opus, Gemini 3 Pro.\n   * Cost: $0.15 (Input with cache) / $1.50 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $5.00 – $15.00 per 1M).\n\n * GLM-4.7 / 5.0 (Zhipu AI)\n   * Performance: Top 3 in Code Arena and tool-use benchmarks (90%+ success rate).\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 3 Flash.\n   * Cost: $0.60 (Input) / $2.20 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $3.00+ per 1M).\"\n\nKeep in mind that enterprise AI is quite new, and that Chinese firms are just getting started. Also, they are hyper focused on very NARROW niches rather than on AGI, and know how to undercut their competition. Again, to minimize losses and maximum gains,\npersonal investors should take note.",

      "text": "OpenAI's CFO Sarah Friar recently posted in the company blog (Jan 18, 2026) their vision for evolving business models beyond basic subscriptions and ads.\n\nThis includes exploring **outcome-based pricing** licensing, and IP-based agreements where OpenAI could take a share of the value created when their AI models play a key role in profitable discoveries or outcomes, especially for enterprise customers.\n\nThis might mean claiming a **slice of revenue from breakthroughs** like AI-accelerated drug discovery in pharma, advancements in scientific research, optimizations in energy systems, or complex financial modeling.\n\nThese revenue models would *\"share in the value created\"* by aligning OpenAI's earnings with customer success.\n\n— This isn't targeting individual users or hobbyist inventions… *yet. —*  \nSources stress it's focused on large-scale enterprise partnerships, not everyday folks tinkering with ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI's annualized recurring revenue is exploding  \n…from $2B in 2023  \n→to over $20B in 2025  \na 10x jump fueled by massive compute scaling. It's clear they're hunting for ways to capture more upside as AI gets smarter.\n\nReactions are split and this thoughts aren't unique to OpenAI. Other AI firms are dipping into value-based pricing, like charging based on automation outcomes or efficiency gains.\n\nAll this amidst Elon Musk's lawsuit accusing OpenAI of ditching its **nonprofit roots** for profit-chasing as he's seeking up to $134B in damages (xAI seems to be steering clear, focusing on subscriptions and open-sourcing older models for now).\n\nIs this the future of AI monetization?\n\nSources: [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/a-business-that-scales-with-the-value-of-intelligence), [forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmarkman/2026/01/20/moving-beyond-chatgpt-openais-new-revenue-model), [cnbc](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/19/openai-to-focus-on-practical-adoption-in-2026-says-finance-chief-sarah-friar.html)",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nOne thing Musk is known for is doing big things in a fraction of the time that it takes others to do them. For example, his team brought the Colossus super computer online in only 122 days, when a project of this magnitude usually takes 2 to 4 years from start to finish. \n\nSo when one of his updates is delayed, and delayed again, you know that something is amiss in xAI land. On December 7th, 2025, Musk announced that Grok 4.2 would be released in 3 or 4 weeks. We are now a few days from February 2026, and there are no signs of the release. Could this mean that the brute force scaling approach has plateaued?\n\nIf we were to guess at the reason for those delays, the most probable is that GPT, Gemini, and even Chinese open source models, have gotten so good so quickly that Musk kept discovering his Grok 4.2 was not proving itself competitive enough on major benchmarks. \n\nOf course the final verdict, at least for the time being, on where we are with the scaling laws won't come until Grok 5 is released in March. Because it will be trained on Colossus 2, with 550 GPUs rather than Colossus 1's 1-200, and built with Nvidia's far more powerful GB200 and GB300 Blackwell chips, we should not be surprised if it blows every other model completely out of the water! And it will surely incorporate the Engram primitive and Poetiq's meta system, further amplifying its reasoning power. This means it will probably have an IQ exceeding 160. \n\nI hope we are nowhere near the plateauing of scaling laws, and that Grok 5 sets a very high new bar that the other developers will scramble to quickly catch up with. But until xAI finally releases Grok 4.2, serving as an interim indicator, we can only wait with mounting expectation.\n\n\n\n",
