But unless I'm missing something, isn't it quite different for the data to exist out there and you use it to train your models, versus companies actively engaging in corporate espionage to steal the way that you go about distilling the data that's out there publicly on the internet?\n\nThere is a difference between public data and private data. You can do anything you want with public data. It has always been there; we just never had a way to ingest it and apply human logic to it at scale. \n\nHowever, private data and proprietary ways that you go about doing something seem quite different than, say, a Reddit post that AI is going to train on.\n\nTo me, it's the difference of a situation where there's a car wash that becomes really popular because it has a cool way that the cars go through—there are disco balls or something—and then another company comes along and tries to copy the exact way they pulled off their drive-through tunnel. \n\nThen, when that first company gets mad at the other one for directly trying to copy them and sending in employees to discover how they're doing it, people say to that first company, \"Well, you can't get mad when you're using the same water that everybody else is using and you're stealing all of that water.\" \n\nLike it's not the water that makes the difference, it's how they're using it in a proprietary way.\n\nThat's kind of how I view it. I don't know if that analogy makes sense, but I'm open to understanding how other people are viewing this. It just doesn't personally make sense to me.",

A company copies millions of works, B company copies A companies work, A company get mad. Because \"You can do anything you want with public data\" might be your opinion but thats not how the copyright law works. There are works out there that have licenses that require attribution if the work was used at a commercial scale. An LLM can reproduce some of those works accurately without said attribution, legally depending on the circumstances surrounding the work there are grounds of copyright infringement. Obviously the large corporations believe that they \"transform\" the data, but none of us can really say since we haven't really seen how their dataset is constructed.\n\nIn the case of the Chinese companies, they paid for the API(not just ripped data off the internet, they paid for the API) and they made their dataset based on the knowledge of the API also referred to as distillation. According to IBM, distillation aims to transfer the learnings of a large pre-trained model, the “teacher model,” to a smaller “student model.” So basically taking the learnings of Anthropic models to make their own smaller models(which is why these models are sometimes small enough to be run locally). The data has to be transformed in this process as well.\n\nIn conclusion, Company A copies millions of work that were public and transforms it to provide a service, Company B pays for Company A's service and copies their work and transform it to provide their own service, Company A get mad just like how the people got mad that their work was used for the creation of the service.",

It would only make sense in a scenario, where a platform dynamically routes between different model versions, But that would be unusual and not your case, right.\n\nMore likely is a hallucination from Claude, trying to explain why it can't identify itself, but infers from the language used and known patterns.",

          "text": "I have no issues with Gemini always get answers to controversial questions. I just posted your question and got ton of material as follows:\n\nNelson Mandela’s perspective on violence was not static; it was a pragmatic evolution shaped by the shifting political landscape of South Africa. His transition from an advocate of non-violent protest to the leader of an armed struggle, and finally to a man of reconciliation, provides a complex case study for historical analysis.\n1. The Shift to Armed Struggle (1961–1964)\nBy the early 1960s, Mandela concluded that the apartheid government’s increasing brutality made non-violence a \"futile\" strategy. This period saw the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the armed wing of the ANC.\n * The Inevitability of Violence:\n   > \"At the beginning of June 1961, after a long and anxious assessment of the South African situation, I and some colleagues came to the conclusion that as violence in this country was inevitable, it would be unrealistic and wrong for African leaders to continue preaching peace and non-violence at a time when the government met our peaceful demands with force.\"\n   > \n   * Source: Statement from the Dock, Rivonia Trial, 1964.\n * Violence as a Defensive Necessity:\n   > \"I did not plan it [sabotage] in a spirit of recklessness, nor because I have any love of violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny, exploitation, and oppression of my people by the Whites.\"\n   > \n   * Source: Statement from the Dock, Rivonia Trial, 1964.\n * Choosing the Form of Violence:\n   Mandela distinguished between sabotage, which targeted infrastructure, and terrorism or guerrilla warfare, which targeted people.\n   > \"We first adopted the method [sabotage] which listed the least amount of human life... We believed that South Africa belonged to all the people who lived in it, and not to one group, be it black or white.\"\n   > \n2. Rationalizing Resistance\nMandela often framed the choice of violence as one dictated by the oppressor, rather than the oppressed.\n * The Oppressor Dictates the Method:\n   > \"The hard facts were that 50 years of non-violence had brought the African people nothing but more and more repressive legislation, and fewer and fewer rights.\"\n   > \n   * Source: Long Walk to Freedom.\n * A Response to Force:\n   > \"A government which uses force to maintain its rule teaches the oppressed to use force to oppose it.\"\n   > \n   * Source: Address to the Pan-African Freedom Movement for East and Central Africa, 1962.\n3. Transition to Peace and Reconciliation (Post-1990)\nUpon his release from prison, Mandela's rhetoric shifted. While he initially refused to renounce the armed struggle as a condition for his release, he eventually championed \"throwing weapons into the sea\" to build a democratic nation.\n * Moving Beyond the Conflict:\n   > \"If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy. Then he becomes your partner.\"\n   > \n   * Source: Long Walk to Freedom.\n * The Goal of the Struggle:\n   > \"Our struggle for freedom and justice was a movement of the people... The time for the healing of the wounds has come. The moment to bridge the chasms that divide us has come.\"\n   > \n   * Source: Inauguration Speech, 1994.\nHistorical Context for Analysis\nWhen analyzing these quotes, it is important to consider the \"Mandela Doctrine\" on violence:\n * Strictly Last Resort: Violence was only adopted after all legal and non-violent avenues were systematically closed by the state.\n * Strategic, Not Emotional: Violence was a political tool used to bring the government to the negotiating table, not an end in itself.\n * Proportionality: The initial focus on sabotage (hitting power lines and government offices) was a deliberate attempt to avoid civil war and loss of life.\nWould you like me to find specific primary source documents or legal arguments used during the Rivonia Trial to further your analysis?",

      "text": "\n\n\n\n\nThe latest OpenClaw alternative, ZeroClaw, has a 3.4MB footprint, and runs on only 5MB of RAM. Compare that to OpenClaw’s over 2GB footprint that requires over 2GB RAM, and you can see the challenge ZeroClaw poses to OpenClaw. ZeroClaw currently lacks the high-level orchestration and ecosystem depth that makes OpenClaw so powerful but this can all be done before the end of the year.\n\nBecause ZeroClaw runs on Rust, it can be relatively easily made to be as powerful as OpenClaw while maintaining its super tiny footprint. ZeroClaw doesn't need to contain all of OpenClaw's features. It just needs to call them. How soon this power boost happens depends almost entirely on how soon the open source community adopts the ZeroClaw architecture.\n\nHere's a plausible timeline. We are now in the migration phase where the zeroclaw migrate openclaw command already exists. Over the next 3 to 6 months developers will be porting OpenClaw skills to the ZeroClaw trait system. As this happens ZeroClaw will achieve functional parity with OpenClaw. By the end of 2026 it will achieve full parity.\n\nHowever, even at full parity ZeroClaw won't be as plug-and-play as OpenClaw is for non-developers because running it requires familiarity with Rust. So ZeroClaw must transition to an \"app-like\" experience by abstracting its complex Rust-based configuration behind a Web UI or an interactive Terminal UI similar to OpenClaw’s onboarding wizard. It will need to adopt a standardized system that allows non-technical users to install skills via a simple marketplace or a drag-and-drop. \n \nThe good news is that this can all happen before the end of 2026, effectively moving AI from a centralized, resource-intensive service you rent into an invisible background service that users own, dramatically lowering the cost of a world filled with billions of agents!",

You can't ban something that you can download from a thousand different sites on the internet and use however you want if you have the computing power to do so... Lol. How secure are you when you use Chatgpt, Claude, or Gemini? You are literally giving your data to those companies, and we know they are not charitable organizations and that they share your data with the government if asked... Deepseek has always been and will continue to be open source, I suppose. In that case, you can run it locally and you won't give your data to anyone. There's nothing more secure than that. And anyone who knows what an LLM is has enough IQ to know that you only expose your data when you connect to an API. It's not an AGI that can take control of your system locally... People aren't idiots, and if it's capable of competing with closed source or coming close to it, they're not going to pay 100 times more to use any of the closed source models. That policy of prohibiting freedoms only leads to something being used more... Open source is getting closer and closer to catching up with closed source and even surpassing it in some ways. With an API, you have latency and biased data, you have control and censorship, but not locally. You can feed your LLM with a Rag system and hundreds of millions of data points so it doesn't go haywire; you just need the computing power to do it.  Deepseek 4 will likely be very large, and you will need hundreds of thousands of dollars just to run it, but that will be pocket change for many medium-sized companies that prioritize their security.",

      "text": "\n\n\n\n\nOn February 17th, 2025, when Grok 3 became the first model to top 1400 on Chatbot Arena, Musk boasted that: \n\n\"Grok-3 is now the smartest AI on Earth. It is the first model to break 1400 in the Arena, and it will remain the most powerful model for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nA month later Grok-3 was no longer the top model on that leaderboard. Oh well.\n\nBut without any fanfare, and without any boasting, Google's Gemini 3.1 has so convincingly become the world's #1 AI that no competitor may ever again retake that top spot. \n\nIt's not just that Gemini 3.1 Deep Think (2/26) CRUSHED ARC-AGI-2 with a score of 84.6%, leaving Opus 4.6 at 69.2% and GPT- 5.3 at 54.2% totally in the dust.\n\nIt's that on the Codeforces benchmark, Gemini 3.1 Deep Think achieved an Elo rating of 3455, placing it as the #8 top coder in the world, surpassing all but seven human coders globally! How completely does this crush the competition? The previous coding leader was OpenAI's o3, which scored 2727 with a world ranking of #175. Yeah, that completely.\n\nAnd to top off the trifecta, on Humanity’s Last Exam — widely considered the hardest academic benchmark for AI -- Gemini 3.1 Pro now tops the leaderboard at 44.4%, leaving Opus 4.6 trailing at 40% and GPT-5.3 (Codex/Thinking) in third at 38.8%.\n\nSo, Gemini 3.1.crushes everyone else not just on reasoning power but also on coding ability. And it dominates on academic knowledge. It's because of this combined supremacy that Gemini seems convincingly unbeatable. And we are now entering the era of recursively self-improving AI. Gemini can use its complete reasoning and coding dominance to accelerate its progress, and thereby outpace all competitors in this recursive self-improvement race. \n\nMusk has been recently bragging about how Grok will begin recursively self-improving on a weekly basis, and we will soon see how this, and it having been trained on Colossus 2, will impact its ability to compete with Gemini. And, of course, DeepSeek could blow everyone else out of the water with some out-of-the-blue advancement when V4 launches, probably in a week or two. \n\nBut the complete dominance that Gemini has shown in reasoning and coding suggests that Google may have just unassailably won the AI race. It seems that its competitors can now only hope to build almost as good models that run inexpensively enough to pose a challenge to Gemini in consumer and enterprise spaces.\n\n",

I was excited because I finally had a model that worked well with such a long context and surpassed any other I've tested for this task.\n\nThe next day, I started with the same tasks and noticed a significant drop. It barely thought for ten seconds, and the performance was degraded, though it still outperforms V3.2.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that they might have been testing a new model (possibly V4) because I haven't seen that level of performance since.

But here's the thing:\n\n**bigger isn't automatically smarter**\n\nLet me prove it with a concrete example you might have missed:\n\n**Step-3.5 Flash** from StepFun AI. At just **197B parameters**,  \nit's currently beating major open and closed-source competitors on key benchmarks.\n\nThe open weight Q4-quantized 110GB version runs locally on a $2-4k DGX/AMD setup with peak inference speed, activating 11B MoE parameters per token.\n\n*\"But what about quality?\"*\n\nSee for yourself:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7glye0j1yfkg1.jpg?width=1168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8212ea18728154fd79cfe78bbf6487cef0aa45ed\n\nThe **knowledge density** is striking when Step-3.5 Flash delivering answers that feel *compressed* with details, pre-trained on 17,6 T Tokens (Deepseek: 14.8T tokens).\n\n**→** Intelligence isn't about how big your bucket is. It's about how much water you actually keep when you stop pouring.\n\n**EDIT**:  \nStepFun revealed in their [recent AMA ](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r8snay/comment/o69pc5q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)that mid-size reasoning models like Step 3.5 Flash (200B) suffer severe knowledge erosion during training from what they call \"alignment tax\". Larger models (>1T) resist this effect better, and chat models avoid it entirely since their patterns differ from the reasoning shortcut.\n\nIn their opinion **only massive models capture linguistic nuance and diversity**, while smaller models merely mimic styles. Deterministic tasks (math, reasoning, agents) work well at smaller scales with sufficient RL.",

They believe the limits for this size class hasn’t been reached yet and are planning improved versions in the coming weeks.\n\nThe interesting question is where DeepSeek's priorities actually lie.\nV3.2 fits at the classic industry-standard ~22 t/p for large models (compared to Step-3.5-Flash's packed 89 t/p). That ratio gives a very stable, low-effort pre-training baseline. If they stick to it for V4, they'll have to scale the model size further. Considering fact that V3.2 already runs with fp8-inference also means they're on lower resolution and might compensate with more params.",

I can't force you to do that you're probably going to ignore what I'm saying in favor of the artificial feedback loop and people who love llms confirming your feelings .But there is an actually issue with going to AI for such advice . \nYour doctor sounds like they're actually trying to help you. And at the same time it sounds like you don't think this is an issue and just want somebody to be able to vent to which is a different type of therapy.... If you want that I'd recommend a counselor not a therapist..... \n\n\nHave you considered that maybe it's not a matter of your psychologist being patient but then actually diagnosing the issue and them trying to get you to deal with the underlying issue rather then fixating on one event which won't help the future.\n\n\nI hope this helps I hope you think about it I hope you don't see this as an attack and see this as advice said out of care when most people are just going to say oh wow please share more!",

But just from reading your couple of comments here it seems to me that the bigger issue is what tools do you have to deal with intrusive thoughts and not fixate . I have the same issue... It's been hard but I've gained tools to deal with it. My guess is the therapist is trying to deal with this issue rather than focus on the issue . Seems like they don't want to listen . But it's not that . There trying to help you so in future you don't do it on other things ... \n\n\nAs for helping you collect your thoughts and sort out chain of event That's not a bad thing to use it for Just always try to remember to double check everything that it will inject its own stuff that is irrelevant or made up and that it is a simulation of possibility not an accurate representation of fact... \n\n\nJust glad you're aware of the dangers and you are proceeding with caution.  I really wish you luck and strength on your journey!",

I don't disagree it may be a bad fit. I'm not saying that they shouldn't change to a different one I'm saying that LLMs are not a replacement for a real human when it comes to such things. Although having a bad therapist especially some of the new age ones today can be just as bad as the LLMS. \nI would argue it's not helpful even for short term If you are truly going through a crisis call the suicide hotline or the several other organizations that have hotlines or websites too chat via text with actual people who can help you. for people having mental health problems and emergencies there are resources for those who need it.. There are so many dangers when using an LLM for mental health help.... It is as likely to cause damage as help. There are quite a few people who have killed themselves over this and there are dozens of documented cases already of psychosis and other major psychological issues from people who have turned to AI for mental and life help... \n\n\nI'm not saying there isn't a chance it gives you the right answer and actually helps you. But there's a very significant chance it tells you things that are extremely bad , completely make stuff up, reaffirm your beliefs even though it knows it's false. \nAnd even more so that it creates a feedback loop of yes maning you and make you feel great . If you've ever done reasoning tasks or role played with deepsek or any other LLM regardless of the prompting and the settings It will make you the greatest it will pump you up it will yes me and you It will try to be helpful and complete the task rather than follow commands and act as a tool... This is even worse after the newest update with deep seek at least the free online chat... \n\n\nI would very strongly advise anybody against using an AI model for mental health You are rolling the dice...litterly ",

      "text": "\n\n\nThis isn't a very well-known benchmark, so let's first just go through what it measures. AA-Omniscience covers 42 economically important topics like law, medicine, business and engineering.\n\nThe LOWER the hallucination rate, the BETTER the model is at adhering to authoritative sources. It calculates how often a model provides a false answer instead of admitting it doesn't know the right answer. It basically measures how often a model becomes dangerous by making things up.\n\nSo, obviously, in high stakes knowledge work like law, medicine and finance, models that do well on this benchmark are especially valuable to these businesses. \n\nNow take a look at the most recent AA-Omniscience Hallucination Rate benchmark leaderboard:\n\n * GLM-5: 34%\n * Claude 4.5 Sonnet: 38%\n * GLM-5 (alternative version): 43%\n * Kimi K2.5: 43%\n * Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview: 50%\n * Claude 4.5 Opus: 60%\n * GPT-5.2: 60%\n * Claude 4.5 Sonnet (alternative version): 61%\n * Kimi K2.5 (alternative version): 64%\n * Grok 4.1 Fast: 72%\n * Claude 4.5 Opus (alternative version): 78%\n * GPT-5.2 (High): 78%\n * Grok 4.1 Fast (alternative version): 81%\n * DeepSeek V3.2: 82%\n * Qwen 3.5 397B A17B: 87%\n * MiniMax-M2.5: 88%\n * Gemini 3 Pro Preview (High): 88%\n * Qwen 3.5 397B A17B (alternative version): 88%\n * DeepSeek V3.2 (alternative version): 99%\n\nNotice that three of the four top models are open source. Also notice that Gemini 3.1, which was released today, only scores 50%. And GPT-5.3 isn't even listed, which probably means it didn't do any better than GPT-5.2's 60%.\n\nOne of the most serious bottlenecks to enterprise adoption today is accuracy, or the minimization of hallucinations. If open source models continue to nail AA-Omniscience, and run at a fraction of the cost of proprietary models, they will very probably become THE models of choice for high stakes businesses where accuracy is supremely important. \n",

I’ve been stress-testing Minimax M2.5 alongside my usual workflow for a heavy-duty multi-file refactor, and the logic-to-latency ratio is actually insane. While everyone is busy simping for Sonnet, they're ignoring that Minimax is hitting a $0.30/M input price point while actually understanding how a state machine works. I ran a Pacman recreation benchmark—Gemini 1.5 Flash was basically a high-speed bug generator, hallucinating collision logic every two lines. DeepSeek-V3 handled the syntax fine but struggled with the high-level architecture once the context hit 50k tokens. Minimax M2.5, however, used its native MoE setup (230B total, 10B active) to map out the ghost movement logic without the usual \"looping\" hallucinations we see in smaller quants. It’s not about finding a \"god model\"; it’s about finding a model that doesn't treat human logic like a suggestion. If you're running complex agentic loops and still haven't benchmarked Minimax for your intermediate \"heavy lifting\" steps, you're basically just paying a brand tax to Anthropic. For those of us who actually code for a living and don't have an infinite VRAM budget, this kind of efficiency is the only way to stay productive without the brain-dead output of a 7B model.",

Many 7B–8B models are already good enough for daily use if you care more about privacy/control than squeezing out the last 5% of quality\n* Consumer and prosumer hardware keeps getting cheaper and more powerful, especially GPUs and Apple Silicon–class chips. People are already running decent local LLMs with 12–16GB VRAM or optimized CPU-only setups for chat and light coding\n\nAt some point, the default might flip: instead of why would you run this locally?, the real question becomes why would you ship your entire prompt and codebase to a third-party API if you don’t strictly need to? For a lot of use cases (personal coding, offline agents, sensitive internal tools), a strong local open model plus a specialized smaller model might be more than enough\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/in-the-long-run-everything-will-be-local-v0-c8o30x8ee4lg1.jpg?width=3600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=597c01e9d5b6dd792b410495addfc55c2e459ea8)\n\n* For *most* individuals and small teams, local open models will be the default for day-to-day chat and code, with cloud models used only when you really need frontier-level reasoning or massive context\n* AI box hardware (a dedicated local LLM server on your LAN) will become as common as a NAS is today for power users",

      "text": "OpenClaw has been trending for all the wrong and right reasons. I saw people rebuilding entire sites through Telegram, running “AI offices,” and one case where an agent wiped thousands of emails because of a prompt injection. That made me stop and actually look at the architecture instead of the demos.\n\nUnder the hood, it’s simpler than most people expect.\n\nOpenClaw runs as a persistent Node.js process on your machine. There’s a single Gateway that binds to localhost and manages all messaging platforms at once: WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord. Every message flows through that one process. It handles authentication, routing, session loading, and only then passes control to the agent loop. Responses go back out the same path. No distributed services. No vendor relay layer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzb9odk9sgkg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=33ec63f05397b28134f113e64c90707107da69f4\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/i-looked-into-openclaw-architecture-to-dig-some-details-v0-pyqx126xqgkg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=418a6eb28e70d9d28b180db3dcd700046c130ebd)\n\nWhat makes it feel different from ChatGPT-style tools is persistence. It doesn’t reset. Conversation history, instructions, tools, even long-term memory are just files under `~/clawd/`. Markdown files. No database. You can open them, version them, diff them, roll them back. The agent reloads this state every time it runs, which is why it remembers what you told it last week.\n\nThe heartbeat mechanism is the interesting part. A cron wakes it up periodically, runs cheap checks first (emails, alerts, APIs), and only calls the LLM if something actually changed. That design keeps costs under control while allowing it to be proactive. It doesn’t wait for you to ask.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7usti6qbsgkg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb73ae08dcdaa36ead1fb8a916256fedbc33f743\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/i-looked-into-openclaw-architecture-to-dig-some-details-v0-gv6eld93rgkg1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a5bc19f10be49a67fabfe952ffc87aba26fbfdf)\n\nThe security model is where things get real. The system assumes the LLM can be manipulated. So enforcement lives at the Gateway level: allow lists, scoped permissions, sandbox mode, approval gates for risky actions. But if you give it full shell and filesystem access, you’re still handing a probabilistic model meaningful control. The architecture limits blast radius, it doesn’t eliminate it.\n\nWhat stood out to me is that nothing about OpenClaw is technically revolutionary. The pieces are basic: WebSockets, Markdown files, cron jobs, LLM calls. The power comes from how they’re composed into a persistent, inspectable agent loop that runs locally.\n\nIt’s less “magic AI system” and more “LLM glued to a long-running process with memory and tools.”\n\nI wrote down the detailed breakdown [here](https://entelligence.ai/blogs/openclaw)",
