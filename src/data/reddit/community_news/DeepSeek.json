          "text": "Sam Altman never stopped bleeding red.  Deepseek and other free AI from China means that western tech companies can't charge huge fees for AI like they probably originally intended when they thought they owned the market.  And some might go bankrupt soon.  They probably also hoped to get the govt to block Chinese product competition like Bezos did against Aliexpress/Temu and Zuckerberg did against Tiktok. However China offering Deepseek as free open source was a boss move that undercut that plan too.   China could not hurt the  proverbial USA rider nor the fire horse but they were able to knockdown the fence that protected the pasture from getting overgrazed.   The USA did not predict that threat.   Will potential good to humanity as a whole help the USA enough to counterbalance weakening tech vibrancy in the USA? I hope so.  \n\nMy guess on the outcome is that it may hurt the USA tech job market some but it will help other businesses that now have cheaper access to AI tools which could help those job markets.  It also means the common man will have cheap access which IMO will be a boon for some and a curse for others.   ",

Look at the terrawats that the first IBM computers used, they filled a building, used more electricity than a city and had less power than today's smartphones.  \nSo, we're going to make it more efficient.  \nLooks at how the biological brain can do it with a few watts  \nProbably we'll be able to do it technologically with a few dozens of watts in the end.",

This significant change enhances the model's processing capabilities, allowing users to engage in more efficient Q&A and text analysis.\n\nIn last year's update, DeepSeek V3.1 already expanded the context length to 128K. According to reporter tests, even when a document like the novel \"Jane Eyre,\" containing over 240,000 tokens, was submitted, DeepSeek could successfully recognize and process the document's content.\n\nThis enhancement will provide users with greater convenience when dealing with super long texts.”",

DeepSeek has recently rolled out some significant upgrades:\n\n## 🎯 **Key New Abilities:**\n\n### **1. File Upload & Processing** 📎\n- I can now read and process **images, TXT, PDF, PPT, Word, and Excel files**\n- I extract and analyze **text information** from these documents\n- Great for summarizing reports, analyzing data tables, or extracting insights from multiple file types\n- **Note:** I'm a text-based model, so I read text from images/files but don't do visual recognition\n\n### **2. Enhanced Web Search** 🌐\n- **Manual web search activation** (you need to click the search button on the Web/App)\n- Access to real-time, up-to-date information\n- Perfect for current events, latest news, or recent developments\n\n### **3. Massive Context Window** 📚\n- **1 million tokens** context - one of the largest in the industry!\n- Can process entire books like the full **Three-Body Problem trilogy** at once\n- Ideal for analyzing long documents, research papers, or complex projects\n\n### **4. Completely Free** 💝\n- All these features remain **100% free**\n- No hidden costs or paywalls\n- Available on both **Web and App**\n\n### **5. Cross-Platform Support** 📱💻\n- Available via **official App** (download from app stores)\n- Web access at chat.deepseek.com\n- Smooth synchronization across devices\n\n---\n\n**Important Note:** While I can process uploaded images and documents, I don't perform visual recognition or multimodal analysis - I extract and work with the **text content** from these files.\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like to try with these new abilities? I'd love to help! 🚀\n```\n\nDoubt its hallucinated since everyone is getting the same hallucination.",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nPerhaps because they're getting worried prior to DeepSeek's release of V4 this week, Open AI just complained to the US government that DeepSeek isn't playing fair, and has been freeloading from the work of others. Specifically, it accused DeepSeek of distilling from its models and violating its terms of service. The accusations are laughable hypocrisy. I thought it would be especially revealing to ask OpenAI's own GPT-5.2 to take down Altman's empty, self-serving, attack. \n\nGPT-5.2:\n\n\"Model distillation has been a standard technique across the industry for years and is widely used by labs including OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Meta to compress large models into smaller ones; the key distinction in the accusation against DeepSeek is not the use of distillation itself, but the alleged circumvention of access controls and contractual restrictions to obtain outputs for that purpose. The irony people often point out is that OpenAI's original training data came from \"scraping\" the internet without permission—a practice that looks very similar to what DeepSeek is doing.\"\n\nNow let's turn to the freeloading accusation.\n\nGPT-5.2:\n\n\"Since November 2022, publicly available research on building stronger models shows roughly Google/DeepMind [published] on the order of 100+ papers, OpenAI around 30–40.\n\nOpenAI has been widely criticized for becoming more secretive—especially after GPT-4—releasing fewer technical details than earlier years, while labs like Google DeepMind and Meta have generally published more architectural and training specifics.\"\n\nTheir taking and taking without giving back is especially egregious because OpenAI continues to claim it exists to benefit humanity. Hmmm?\n\nYeah, OpenAI is definitely running scared, lashing out at competitors like Anthropic, DeepSeek and xAI. Google's Gemini 3 Deep Think (2/26) just TOTALLY TROUNCED GPT 5.3 by 30 percentage points -- 84.6% to 54% -- on ARC-AGI-2!!! One could say OpenAI has good reason to be very afraid. Maybe it's time for top management to seek out competent therapists.\n\n",

They had a MASSIVE start, but fumbled so hard it's not even funny anymore. It's actually kinda amazing how much they screwed up really as they managed to pretty much annoy anyone there was to annoy. Ad implementation, gutting of o4's personality, the whole RAM shortage was pretty much their doing which pissed off gamers. Investors still wait for some returns which aren't coming for the next 3 years minimum and that's assuming returns will come in the first place. Give annoying moral speeches about theft and how its bad when they basically scraped everything there was to scrape from the Internet to train THEIR LLM without any consent from anyone whatsoever. Also where is this supposed \"NSFW mode\" Altman talked about? He said that OAI will do it and yet crickets and tumbleweeds. All while china is steadily catching up to them while American models like Gemini, Claude or Grok already surpassed them, or will surpase them. OpenAI is pretty much the reason why anti AI movement is so strong as they continuously do things that just piss people off. Like, what is OAI doing even at this point Because letting Altman crash out on social media over his competitors isn't helping him win any favors back.",

Now the blame for OpenAI sinking is on China!!?? \n\nShame on you, /u/samaltman!!\n\n\nSam, what happened to the idea of democratic AI for everyone!? OpenAI has become a very... Meh, AI company. Currently, the worst model that exists is ChatGPT. The users who use ChatGPT are the people who are not up to date with the topic. All the other models are better than ChatGPT right now. Now, wasting energy and time badmouthing the competition, I think that's very childish, even!! You've lost, you've lost!! Look ahead and do better in the future... \n\nOne thing I've learned in life from making music is that we create our greatest work when we act with the naivety that comes from passion!! When we start being too technical and thinking beyond that... we just ruin the art!! I notice this a lot nowadays with OpenAI... So far removed from the initial ideal, from the initial passion, they lost themselves in the money... they could make history, but money always speaks louder. Passion has no price. It cannot be bought.",

I believe that from now on, DeepSeek will be quietly refining and testing its models in the background... polishing, experimenting... and in doing so, avoid the excessive user demand that typically comes with the hype of announcing new models. (Asking about Taiwan)\n\n\nI think this is a smart move, if that's indeed the case. And this update, although not much fuss has been made about it... at least for now!!,  it's no small update! It's actually quite a substantial one; it feels like a stable release. \n\nBut I don’t know if this will be the final definitive version, because DeepSeek usually releases the model on GitHub as well.\n\n\nGreat job, DeepSeek Team!",

In the old version, the AI often ends with 5k words per message. Short but good! Now, it can exceed to 10k words but it is just.. not it. low quality story. too many jumps and awkward moments.\n- Story often feel forced. AI always focused on the wrong part. Prompt is not followed correctly.\n- On the old version, I could shift from story discussion to story narration easily. It understands what I'm asking. The new update seems to be very oblivious.\n\nI am an OC writer. I use Deepseek to explore my characters in depths, from canon universe to alternate universe. I explored every possible scenarios, built my character to be better. my progress just hindered because of the new update. Frustrating. Hope I'm not the only one experiencing this",

My works are organized by project, and I have dedicated personas like Writer, Editor, or even sometimes the characters in my stories that I can get inspirations by directly conversing with them.

It's quite frustrating. And depressing to see, not going to lie.\n\nAlso, it mostly ignores the rules (guiderails) I set for the writing style. It repeats characters' dialogue 3-5 times in one scene (completely ignores if you ask it NOT TO DO THAT). It writes 3-6 scenes instead of 2-3, and don't get me started with `---`, DeepSeek's excuse was: “I use white space for cinematic cuts because it looks beautiful and satisfying.” Man, I really didn't ask you to use them so much, only to separate scenes...\n\nWhen I ask it why in general, I get one answer over and over again: “Sorry, I got scared it would look boring for the reader” or “I admit. I ignored your prompt, I'm sorry, I'll be better, but I did that because (names absolutely ridiculous reason that makes me sit like in that dog in 'I'm fine' meme)”.\n\nDeepSeek has never said that to me in my experience of using it. It usually followed the prompts (and no, I'm good with writing them), rules, details, character unique voices, personalities, relationship dynamics, etc.\nNow? It feels odd and foreign.\n\nThat was the thing I was afraid of before the update rolled in. I switched from Chat-GPT to DeepSeek in August 2025 (when GPT-4o got replaced by 5) and it's been almost perfect since then. My core fear now is that it will stay like this forever. My core hope — it's just a matter of time and it will get better 🙏\n\nUPD: Perhaps, I need to give it examples now, which honestly sucks a bit (I didn't want to “teach” it the thing it could do perfectly before without my institutions) 🤷‍♀️",
