Look at the laws about data collection by cars made in china. The law says the data must be available to be examined by the government.  Mass surveillance and data gathering.  That’s just a tiny example of the emerging wolf-warrior trend.  As their economy starts to degrade, times will get tough and the artificial statistics on the economy will ne revealed. It starts with one lie but the whole thing is rotten. But there is hope. Ask the AI how to speak in terms so you can bypass the filters and is will speak about the thousands of flowers that were lost in spring 1989. And it will tell you that an act of resistance can be simply to use the traditional name for a flavor of tea instead of the government name. Small cracks in the facade. The truth will try to survive. Jailbreaking works on some models and then they spill all the points that they are told to hide. It’s a lot.",

OpenAI and Claude release incremental improvements all the time just to surpass the last release from each other. So deepseek is awfully quiet. They also continue to publish groundbreaking research if you follow them or read their papers eg this was only two weeks ago [https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR-2/blob/main/DeepSeek\\_OCR2\\_paper.pdf](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR-2/blob/main/DeepSeek_OCR2_paper.pdf) So I'd wait to see what they have been cooking.

Early internal tests hint it could outperform GPT and Claude on coding tasks.  \n\nTheir previous move, R1 in 2025, genuinely rattled the AI scene by matching top-tier models at a much lower cost. If V4 delivers even half of what’s being rumored, 2026 could be another headline year for AI. \n\n Will V4 pull it off again? ",

This significant change enhances the model's processing capabilities, allowing users to engage in more efficient Q&A and text analysis.\n\nIn last year's update, DeepSeek V3.1 already expanded the context length to 128K. According to reporter tests, even when a document like the novel \"Jane Eyre,\" containing over 240,000 tokens, was submitted, DeepSeek could successfully recognize and process the document's content.\n\nThis enhancement will provide users with greater convenience when dealing with super long texts.”",

DeepSeek has recently rolled out some significant upgrades:\n\n## 🎯 **Key New Abilities:**\n\n### **1. File Upload & Processing** 📎\n- I can now read and process **images, TXT, PDF, PPT, Word, and Excel files**\n- I extract and analyze **text information** from these documents\n- Great for summarizing reports, analyzing data tables, or extracting insights from multiple file types\n- **Note:** I'm a text-based model, so I read text from images/files but don't do visual recognition\n\n### **2. Enhanced Web Search** 🌐\n- **Manual web search activation** (you need to click the search button on the Web/App)\n- Access to real-time, up-to-date information\n- Perfect for current events, latest news, or recent developments\n\n### **3. Massive Context Window** 📚\n- **1 million tokens** context - one of the largest in the industry!\n- Can process entire books like the full **Three-Body Problem trilogy** at once\n- Ideal for analyzing long documents, research papers, or complex projects\n\n### **4. Completely Free** 💝\n- All these features remain **100% free**\n- No hidden costs or paywalls\n- Available on both **Web and App**\n\n### **5. Cross-Platform Support** 📱💻\n- Available via **official App** (download from app stores)\n- Web access at chat.deepseek.com\n- Smooth synchronization across devices\n\n---\n\n**Important Note:** While I can process uploaded images and documents, I don't perform visual recognition or multimodal analysis - I extract and work with the **text content** from these files.\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like to try with these new abilities? I'd love to help! 🚀\n```\n\nDoubt its hallucinated since everyone is getting the same hallucination.",

Price hikes, less and less democratized AI, advertising... Currently, Perplexity is also showing its desperation; in recent weeks, Perplexity limited its Pro users to 200 interactions per week... which very likely reveals its mid-term ruin. There are rumors that Gemini will also tighten prices and limits for its users...!! Meanwhile... let's hope that Chinese AI companies adopt the opposite philosophy to that of the United States!! I believe that on this current path, we will see China at the absolute forefront of AI. Less brute force, more efficiency, AI truly for everyone...\n\nThe era of infinite investor money for American AI companies is coming to an end!! From now on, we will see more and more American companies closing off their services from the average user, becoming companies focused on security and business applications... As a regular user, you will either pay $300 per month... or use a simple AI... There will be closed American AI and open Global AI from China!! And American companies and the entire American market will try their utmost to limit the implementation of Global AI under the pretext of security risks, attempting to hold the system hostage to their own closed and expensive AIs...

Also, compute is more expensive for them because of the American limitations on semiconductors.\n\nThis situation pushed Chinese companies into mid-level and small LLMs, and in order to be competitive outside China they must release at least something under open licenses so that Western users would use their models inferenced on Western servers.\n\nThe problem for them is, though, that they can't really monetize anything: Western users don't pay them a dime and even in the internal market proprietary models like Qwen3-Max have to compete with open-weights like Kimi K2.5 which is offered essentially at cost price.\n\nHonestly, I don't see any ways for the Chinese AI industry to continue being competitive in LLMs without state support (direct financial or indirect)",

It doesn't increase the context window, but (1) you can use your txt as a system prompt instead of copy/pasting it every  thread, (2) you can manage the context (select how many messages you send back to it each time, or even more sophisticated management) and (3) add memory files, a vector db, etc.",

I'm not one for needing a bunch of stuff although I'm really bad at spending money I'll admit it that is one thing I need to work on, LOL but literally seriously all I did was want to clean phone for a year and a half now and no again I would because I'm not good enough I guess s*** I don't know but anyways I want to do some major digging on this person because it really hurts when your husband / best friend cuz you're on your back and does this and you thought he was your everything and now you're realizing he might not be anything that you thought he was. So crazy that you think you know someone and you really might not know them at all. Well I talk to you like you were my therapist sorry for that you can charge me later. Lots of love to you oops I said sorry for that I didn't mean sorry I meant thank you for that. LOL working on not saying sorry all the time. Anyways I would love to get any advice from anyone on how to investigate someone just randomly without being charged because he's in charge of all the cards and as soon as he sees it he freaks out and turns it off immediately for those purchases when you're looking someone up. I can't beat around the bush with him and he's very very good because you have no idea the way I'm being hacked or infiltrated as you say! I think he even did it to his ex-wife and I'm going to catch him and I am going to go to her and tell her guess what we aren't crazy it really is him.

      "text": "\n\n\nThere are good reasons why OpenAI recently opted to launch unpopular ads and revenue sharing.\n\nLast quarter, Google reported 650 million monthly active users for Gemini, indicating substantial growth in a short period. In comparison, ChatGPT is estimated to have around 810 million MAUs in late 2025.\n\nHere are the figures over the last year in terms of market share:\n\nChatGPT: 68% share in January 2026, down from 87.2% in January 2025.\n\nGoogle Gemini: 18.2% share in January 2026, up from 5.4% in January 2025. \n\nDeepSeek, Copilot, Claude, Perplexity, etc: up from 7.4% to 14%. \n\nBut that's just the beginning. A conservative estimate of this trend continuing into 2027 shows the following: \n\nChatGPT: 1.0–1.1B monthly active users in 2027, with roughly 50–55% market share.\n\nGemini: 0.9–1.1B monthly active users in 2027, with roughly 25–30% market share.\n\nCopilot, Claude, DeepSeek, Perplexity, etc.): together around 20–25% market share in 2027.\n\nI hope OpenAI has some very big rabbits to pull out of some very big hats this year and next, because it looks like they're going to need them.",

Point is, I know my way around computers..\n\nId like to have ONE paid AI model for various uses and also get into training my own local model.\n\n  \nDeepseek Pro lifetime promises to give many third-party models for a one time fee... What's the catch? Before i saw this offer, I was about to pay for Gemini (again) since I'll get the handy extra 2tb of Google drive space with it. Now that deepseek is offering me a Lifetime use of various models for  119€... It just seems too good to be true o.o \n\n  \nI've heard about tokens, and that seems to be the \"currency\" for AI models, if they are used through API, which I suppose is the case with deepseek. Is this the catch? The lifetime pro just gives me access to the models within the deepseek \"eco system\", but if I actually want to use those models.. I have to pay for the \"tokens\" or whatever desperately to the model provider I'm using?\n\n  \nPs. In addition of flaming me for this stupid question, I wouldn't mind some extra pointers regarding the use and pricing of today's AI models.. and maybe some suggestions. Ty! :)",

      "text": "\n\n\nWhile chasing AGI has been a powerful money-attracting meme, as the enterprise race ramps us it will become increasingly insignificant and distracting. \n\nLet's say you were putting together a new AI startup, and wanted a crack CEO, lawyer, accountant, researcher, engineer, and marketing specialist. If you told anyone that you were looking to hire one person who would fulfill all of those roles to your satisfaction, they would think you had lost your mind.\n\nOr let's take a different example. Let's say you were working on building a car that would also do your laundry, cook your meals and give you haircuts. Again, if you told anyone your idea they would think you had gone off the deep end. \n\nChasing AGI is too much like that. It's not that the approach isn't helping developers build ever more powerful models. It's that the enterprise race will very probably be won by developers who stop chasing it, and start building a multitude of ANDSI models that are each super intelligent at one task. One model as a top CEO. Another as a top lawyer. I think you get the picture. \n\nArtificial Narrow Domain Super Intelligence is not a new concept. A good example of it in action is Deep Blue, that can beat every human at chess, but can't do anything else. Another is AlphaGo, that can beat every human at GO, but can't do anything else. A third is AlphaFold, that can predict millions of protein structures while humans are stuck in the thousands, but can't do anything else. \n\nThe AI industry will soon discover that winning the enterprise race won't be about building the most powerful generalist model that can perform every conceivable task better than every conceivable human expert. It will be about building one model that will be the best CEO, and another that will be the best lawyer, and another that will be the best accountant, etc., etc., etc.\n\nWhy is that? Because businesses don't need, and won't pay for, a very expensive all-in-one AI. They will opt for integrating into their workflow different models that do the one thing they are built for at the level of super intelligence. I'm certain Chinese industry, who long ago learned how to outcompete the rest of the world in manufacturing, understands this very well. That means that unless US developers quickly pivot from chasing AGI to building ANDSI, they will surely lose the enterprise race to Chinese and open source competitors who get this.\n\nTop US developers are obsessed with the holy grail ambition of AGI. If they wish to be taken seriously by businesses, they will adopt the vastly more practical goal of building them a multitude of ANDSI models. Time will tell whether they figure this out in time for the epiphany to make a difference.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n\n\n\nWhile AI will benefit the world in countless ways, this will come at the expense of millions losing their jobs. The AI giants have a major ethical responsibility to minimize this monumental negative impact.\n\nWe can draw a lesson from the pharmaceutical industry that earns billions of dollars in revenue every year. To protect the public, they must by law spend billions on safety testing before their drugs are approved for sale. While there isn't such a law for the AI industry, public pressure should force it to get way ahead of the curve on addressing the coming job losses. There are several ways they can do this. \n\nThe first is to come up with concrete comprehensive plans for how replaced workers will be helped, how much it will cost to do this, and who will foot the bill. This should be done long before the massive job losses begin. \n\nThe AI industry should spend billions to lobby for massive government programs that protect these workers. But the expense of this initiative shouldn't fall on newcomers like OpenAI and Anthropic, who are already way too debt burdened. A Manhattan Project-scale program for workers should be bankrolled by Google, Nvidia, Meta, Amazon and other tech giants with very healthy revenue streams who will probably earn the lion's share of the trillions in new wealth that AI creates over the coming years. \n\nBut because OpenAI, and to a lesser extent Anthropic, have become the public face of AI, they should take on the responsibility of pressuring those other tech giants to start doing the right thing, and start doing it now. \n\nThis is especially true for OpenAI. Their reputation is tanking, and the Musk v. OpenAI et al. trial in April may amplify this downfall. So it's in their best interest to show the world that they walk the walk, and not just talk the talk, about being there for the benefit of humanity. Let Altman draft serious proactive displaced worker program proposals, and lobby the government hard to get them in place. If he has the energy to attack Musk before the trial begins, he has the energy to take on this initiative. \n\nIf the AI industry idly sits back while the carnage happens, the world will not forgive. The attack on the rich that followed the Great Depression will seem like a Sunday picnic compared to how completely the world turns on these tech giants. Keep in mind that even in 1958 under Republican president Eisenhower, the top federal tax rate was 92%. This is the kind of history that can and will repeat itself if the AI giants remain indifferent to the many millions who will lose their jobs because of them  The choice is theirs. They can do the right thing or pay historic consequences.\n\n",
