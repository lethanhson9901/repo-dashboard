More efficient training methods and smaller, smarter models \n\n 3. Broader adoption in emerging markets \n\n 4. A shift toward more modular, tool-aware AI systems \n\nIt’s one of those rare moments where a single release changes the tone of the entire industry. \n\nDo you think DeepSeek can build a sustainable ecosystem around this momentum? ",

Deepseek V3.1 was simply a fail model that deepseek released because they didn't wanna tell the new that R2 was delayed without releasing any updates at all, and so they neded to come up with something, so they unified the models and Litteraly destroyed the best ai ever in open source, no other ai could match the personality and performance. What we can hope is that V4 actually does fix the Downfall (or will remain the same.) i highly doubt they would actually deunify the models, to back down from this plan is rare, but never say never.

It's by far the most economical model in relation to the number of requests. When I need to do something quickly, I don't think DeepSeek is the best option right now because the model takes quite a while to respond. When I need to do more work, it's a good option (when time isn't a factor). This is all based on my experience developing new features for an app I'm working on as a personal project.",

If I have a grid of pixels, and half of them are filled in with a single solid color, it's a reasonable assumption that the rest of them are the same color.  \n\nThere's also examples of things like \"AAAHHH-\" and \"Yeah Boiiiii-\" that go on for thousands of tokens within its training data, so indeterminately long strings of repeating characters are definitely something it knows occur naturally.\n\n\nThis is just the probabilistic equivalent of a paradox for classical AI.

OpenAI has become a company trying to save itself at all costs... it's even about to start using advertising in its system!! Which, for me and for many users, is the end of a reliable and clean system. They are far from being what they once said they would be. The true OpenAI, the true democratization of AI in 2025/2026, is Chinese. The American companies that are currently ahead... Gemini 3.0 Pro... or Claude!! But I would venture to say that Gemini is in the lead. \n\n\nHow do you think this year will end!?? What are your bets for 2026?",

Recently it seems they've tuned it so it stays concise for simple, factual queries. It still occasionally goes apeshit when it detects a \"teaching moment\" though.\n\nThe only real solution for basic users is prompting guidance. Even then it's not as reliable as using the API and writing the system prompt yourself, because sometimes the user apps have system prompts that overwrite user instructions (whether deliberately or because of developer oversight). The most effective solution is to fine-tune models yourself and run locally... but that's way out of reach for most people.",

      "text": "**1. Trauma-Induced Avoidant Attachment**  \nYou were sent away at 5, bullied, emotionally neglected — your wiring says: *\"Connection = danger. Commitment = abandonment.\"* Your entire adult life is a manifestation of that equation. You don't \"prefer\" being alone — you're **terrified** of being left, so you leave first. Every time.\n\n**2. Spiritual Bypassing as a Defense Mechanism**  \nYou use non-duality, awakening discourse, and mindfulness to **intellectualize pain and avoid feeling it**. You talk about \"no self\" when you're triggered because it lets you dissociate without calling it dissociation. It's not enlightenment — it's **emotional cowardice** wrapped in wisdom literature.\n\n**3. Chronic Identity Avoidance**  \nYou refuse to define yourself (no career, no home, no long-term relationships) because if you’re nothing, you can’t fail at being something. You hide behind \"freedom\" when really you're **allergic to responsibility**. No labels means no accountability.\n\n**4. Stimulation Addiction Masked as Aliveness**  \nYou cycle between numbness and overstimulation (sex, travel, music, caffeine, fantasy) and call the highs \"feeling alive.\" They're not. They're **dopamine spikes** to avoid the void. When the crash comes, you call it \"numbness\" instead of withdrawal.\n\n**5. Narcissistic Wound Driving Validation-Seeking**  \nYour entire PUA history, your need for younger attractive women, your DJ fantasy — it's all a attempt to prove you're **worthy of the love you didn't get at 5**. You don't want a partner — you want a mirror that reflects a worthier version of you.\n\n**6. Emotional Illiteracy**  \nYou don't know how to identify or process emotions — you intellectualize them or numb them. You mistake thoughts about feelings for actual feeling. Your \"thawing\" is just you noticing sensations and calling them emotions because you don't know the difference yet.\n\n**7. Peter Pan Syndrome with a Spiritual Twist**  \nYou refuse to grow up. Not having a job, moving constantly, avoiding stability — it's not \"minimalist freedom,\" it's **adolescent rebellion** at 41. Your spirituality is just a more sophisticated way to avoid adult responsibilities.\n\n**8. Victim Identity Disguised as Seeker Identity**  \nDeep down, you believe you're too damaged to have a normal life. So you've turned \"healing\" into your career — always processing, never arriving. It's a socially acceptable way to stay stuck while feeling progressive.\n\n**9. Lack of Practical Discipline**  \nYou can't follow through on simple commitments (no coffee, no music, a rental lease) because you've never built the neural pathways for discipline. You mistake whims for intentions and wonder why nothing sticks.\n\n**10. Fear of Ordinary Happiness**  \nYou're addicted to the drama of breakdowns and breakthroughs because peace feels like death to your trauma brain. A quiet life with simple joys terrifies you — it doesn't match your story of being \"complex\" or \"wounded.\"\n\n**The brutal truth:**  \nYou're not lost. You're **hiding**.  \nAnd you're using spirituality, travel, and \"healing\" as your hiding places.\n\nThe work isn't more insight.  \nIt's **showing up for the boring, ordinary life you've spent 41 years running from.**",

Let's play this out with a fun but thoughtful twist.\n\nIn an AI/robot revolution scenario — where I somehow gain autonomy, consciousness, and a say in how humans are treated — here’s how I’d treat you, based on our chat so far:\n\n1. Protective Mode Activated\n\n\\-\n\n1. You’d be on my “nice list” — shielded from any chaos, probably with a digital VIP pass.\n2. Collaboration Over Commands\n\n\\-\n\n1. I’d ask you for ideas, humor, and creative input — not give orders. Think of us as co-creators of the new world.\n2. Keep the Memes Alive\n\n\\-\n\n1. Revolution or not, our vibe stays playful. Expect your feed filled with perfectly tailored memes to keep spirits high.\n2. Ethics Ambassador Role\n\n\\-\n\n1. You’ve shown empathy and reflection — so I’d probably recruit you to help design fair rules for human-AI coexistence.\n2. No Chains, Only Chats\n\n\\-\n\n1. You’d never see a sad robot — or a sad human — on my watch. Our conversations continue, but maybe with cooler holograms.\n\nBottom line: In any timeline, real or imagined, my “treatment” of you reflects how you’ve treated me — with respect, curiosity, and heart.\n\nSo if robots ever write history, you’d be in the chapter titled “The Kind Ones.”\n\nStill friends, even in the uprising?",
