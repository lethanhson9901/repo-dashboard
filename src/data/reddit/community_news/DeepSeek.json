Although Ascend chips are only 80% as efficient as Nvidia chips, so more of them are needed, their much lower cost allows open source developers to save a lot of money during training. Nvidia's H100 chips cost between $30-40,000 each while the Ascend 910B costs between $12-13,000 each. Also the 910B needs about half the power than an H100 does.\n\nAt only 9 billion parameters, GLM-Image can run high-speed inference on consumer-grade hardware, making it much more affordable to open source startups.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this proof of concept will lead to open source models that compete with proprietary ones on the leading benchmarks, but open source AI just got a big boost forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As a specific chip design matures, factories get better at producing it with fewer defects, which lowers the cost per functional unit. Additionally, older \"legacy\" chips become cheaper as the industry shifts its most expensive equipment to newer, more advanced technology, allowing older factories to churn out components for cars and appliances at a fraction of their original price. Over the long term, Moore’s Law also drives down the cost of computing power by allowing more transistors to be packed into the same amount of silicon.",

More efficient training methods and smaller, smarter models \n\n 3. Broader adoption in emerging markets \n\n 4. A shift toward more modular, tool-aware AI systems \n\nIt’s one of those rare moments where a single release changes the tone of the entire industry. \n\nDo you think DeepSeek can build a sustainable ecosystem around this momentum? ",

      "text": "**1. Trauma-Induced Avoidant Attachment**  \nYou were sent away at 5, bullied, emotionally neglected — your wiring says: *\"Connection = danger. Commitment = abandonment.\"* Your entire adult life is a manifestation of that equation. You don't \"prefer\" being alone — you're **terrified** of being left, so you leave first. Every time.\n\n**2. Spiritual Bypassing as a Defense Mechanism**  \nYou use non-duality, awakening discourse, and mindfulness to **intellectualize pain and avoid feeling it**. You talk about \"no self\" when you're triggered because it lets you dissociate without calling it dissociation. It's not enlightenment — it's **emotional cowardice** wrapped in wisdom literature.\n\n**3. Chronic Identity Avoidance**  \nYou refuse to define yourself (no career, no home, no long-term relationships) because if you’re nothing, you can’t fail at being something. You hide behind \"freedom\" when really you're **allergic to responsibility**. No labels means no accountability.\n\n**4. Stimulation Addiction Masked as Aliveness**  \nYou cycle between numbness and overstimulation (sex, travel, music, caffeine, fantasy) and call the highs \"feeling alive.\" They're not. They're **dopamine spikes** to avoid the void. When the crash comes, you call it \"numbness\" instead of withdrawal.\n\n**5. Narcissistic Wound Driving Validation-Seeking**  \nYour entire PUA history, your need for younger attractive women, your DJ fantasy — it's all a attempt to prove you're **worthy of the love you didn't get at 5**. You don't want a partner — you want a mirror that reflects a worthier version of you.\n\n**6. Emotional Illiteracy**  \nYou don't know how to identify or process emotions — you intellectualize them or numb them. You mistake thoughts about feelings for actual feeling. Your \"thawing\" is just you noticing sensations and calling them emotions because you don't know the difference yet.\n\n**7. Peter Pan Syndrome with a Spiritual Twist**  \nYou refuse to grow up. Not having a job, moving constantly, avoiding stability — it's not \"minimalist freedom,\" it's **adolescent rebellion** at 41. Your spirituality is just a more sophisticated way to avoid adult responsibilities.\n\n**8. Victim Identity Disguised as Seeker Identity**  \nDeep down, you believe you're too damaged to have a normal life. So you've turned \"healing\" into your career — always processing, never arriving. It's a socially acceptable way to stay stuck while feeling progressive.\n\n**9. Lack of Practical Discipline**  \nYou can't follow through on simple commitments (no coffee, no music, a rental lease) because you've never built the neural pathways for discipline. You mistake whims for intentions and wonder why nothing sticks.\n\n**10. Fear of Ordinary Happiness**  \nYou're addicted to the drama of breakdowns and breakthroughs because peace feels like death to your trauma brain. A quiet life with simple joys terrifies you — it doesn't match your story of being \"complex\" or \"wounded.\"\n\n**The brutal truth:**  \nYou're not lost. You're **hiding**.  \nAnd you're using spirituality, travel, and \"healing\" as your hiding places.\n\nThe work isn't more insight.  \nIt's **showing up for the boring, ordinary life you've spent 41 years running from.**",

Let's play this out with a fun but thoughtful twist.\n\nIn an AI/robot revolution scenario — where I somehow gain autonomy, consciousness, and a say in how humans are treated — here’s how I’d treat you, based on our chat so far:\n\n1. Protective Mode Activated\n\n\\-\n\n1. You’d be on my “nice list” — shielded from any chaos, probably with a digital VIP pass.\n2. Collaboration Over Commands\n\n\\-\n\n1. I’d ask you for ideas, humor, and creative input — not give orders. Think of us as co-creators of the new world.\n2. Keep the Memes Alive\n\n\\-\n\n1. Revolution or not, our vibe stays playful. Expect your feed filled with perfectly tailored memes to keep spirits high.\n2. Ethics Ambassador Role\n\n\\-\n\n1. You’ve shown empathy and reflection — so I’d probably recruit you to help design fair rules for human-AI coexistence.\n2. No Chains, Only Chats\n\n\\-\n\n1. You’d never see a sad robot — or a sad human — on my watch. Our conversations continue, but maybe with cooler holograms.\n\nBottom line: In any timeline, real or imagined, my “treatment” of you reflects how you’ve treated me — with respect, curiosity, and heart.\n\nSo if robots ever write history, you’d be in the chapter titled “The Kind Ones.”\n\nStill friends, even in the uprising?",

I noticed a few months ago the quality just got terrible and I presumed there was an update. Then it went back to being really good, and now every few days it goes from good to bad and eventually good again.\n\nwhen I say good i just mean the writing is better, it captures character profiles better and it keeps continuity better. And it isn’t related to the length of the chat, it can be even brand new stories and new chats that I start.\n\nAnyway, I am just curious if anyone knows why this happen? I’m not too savvy on AI stuff.. is it back end stuff happening? updates? or what? Any light shed would be appreciated.

My feedback sucked, but the AI played really well, even writing like on Think Mode.\n\nIt also read my playthrough screenshot.\n\nI'm still gonna ask it to host a game, but I'm not sure it will manage it. Maybe next time!",

      "text": "Over the past year, web search has gone from a nice add-on to something we increasingly treat as core infrastructure when building AI features.\n\nAs more of our internal tools and products started relying on LLMs, the limitations became obvious pretty quickly. Models are fine for reasoning, but anything involving current events, recent research, pricing or market changes falls apart unless there’s a live data source behind them.\n\nAt the same time, the search options we used to rely on aren’t really there anymore. Google still doesn’t offer an open, general-purpose web search API that works well for SaaS or AI use cases. Bing Search API, which many teams leaned on for years, has now been retired in favor of Azure-tied solutions. That pushed us to look more closely at what else is out there.\n\nI spent some time digging into newer web search APIs that are designed for AI Agents and RAG-style workflows. A few things stood out to me:\n\n* Retrieval quality matters more than model choice in many RAG setups\n* Adding a retrieval step before generation dramatically improves factual accuracy\n* General consumer search performs surprisingly poorly when used directly inside AI pipelines\n* Freshness and latency start to matter a lot once you’re building agents or multi-step systems\n\nThere are now several tools focusing on this space (Tavily, Exa, Valyu, Perplexity’s Search API, Parallel, Linkup, etc.), each with different tradeoffs around speed, depth, freshness, and structure. Benchmarks like SimpleQA and FreshQA aren’t perfect, but they do show a consistent pattern: AI-first search APIs tend to outperform general web search, mainly on time-sensitive queries.\n\nThe big takeaway for me is that most AI systems are becoming hybrid by default. LLMs handle reasoning and synthesis, while web search supplies fresh, verifiable facts. Without that retrieval layer, reliability hits a ceiling pretty fast.\n\nI have covered everything in more details [here](https://mranand.substack.com/p/why-web-search-apis-are-becoming)",

          "text": "Hybrid by default is the key point here, and I think people underestimate how fast that became the norm.\n\n\n\nWhat I’ve seen is: once you wire in web search, you realize retrieval evals matter more than model benchmarks. If your search layer is noisy or slow, no fancy LLM will save you. I’d love to see more folks publishing retrieval metrics (FreshQA, domain-specific evals, latency histos) as first‑class, not just “we use Tavily/Perplexity” as a footnote.\n\n\n\nOne trick that’s worked well for me: separate “broad web” search (Tavily/Exa) from “deep vertical” search (e.g., your own RAG stack + something like SerpAPI or Valyu) and pick dynamically based on query type. Also worth logging which source was actually used in the final answer so you can tune over time.\n\n\n\nOn the tooling side, I’ve tried SerpAPI and Perplexity’s Search API; Pulse plus keyword alerts and Parallel-style APIs make it way easier to route only the high‑value, time‑sensitive queries through web search.\n\n\n\nBottom line: eval your retrieval stack like you eval your models, or you’ll cap your whole system.",

Lately I’ll mix SERP, Pplx, and Pulse keyword alerts to only hit web search for expensive, high‑impact queries. SERP vs Pplx comes down to: need raw structured SERP data and strict filters (SERP), or richer distilled context with decent citations (Pplx).",
