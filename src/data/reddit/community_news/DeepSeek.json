They also continue to publish groundbreaking research if you follow them or read their papers eg this was only two weeks ago [https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR-2/blob/main/DeepSeek\\_OCR2\\_paper.pdf](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR-2/blob/main/DeepSeek_OCR2_paper.pdf) So I'd wait to see what they have been cooking.

Early internal tests hint it could outperform GPT and Claude on coding tasks.  \n\nTheir previous move, R1 in 2025, genuinely rattled the AI scene by matching top-tier models at a much lower cost. If V4 delivers even half of what’s being rumored, 2026 could be another headline year for AI. \n\n Will V4 pull it off again? ",

By Honesty to be exact I mean - if I ask DeepSeek do these 10 things for me, it actually goes and does it and will not say they are done, until they are really done. If it runs out of context - it will just run out of it and stop responding, if it needs to make an assumption - it will tell me about it, if it needs to shortcut something - it tells me about it. Point being it thinks and communicates clearly and doesn’t give a fk about me. That’s the part I like and I can trust it that it’s not making stuff up. Try what people keep raving about Opus 4.5 etc they will misrepresent facts all the time and in the end tell you - great it’s all done. When in reality it’s all bull crap underneath.",

This significant change enhances the model's processing capabilities, allowing users to engage in more efficient Q&A and text analysis.\n\nIn last year's update, DeepSeek V3.1 already expanded the context length to 128K. According to reporter tests, even when a document like the novel \"Jane Eyre,\" containing over 240,000 tokens, was submitted, DeepSeek could successfully recognize and process the document's content.\n\nThis enhancement will provide users with greater convenience when dealing with super long texts.”",

DeepSeek has recently rolled out some significant upgrades:\n\n## 🎯 **Key New Abilities:**\n\n### **1. File Upload & Processing** 📎\n- I can now read and process **images, TXT, PDF, PPT, Word, and Excel files**\n- I extract and analyze **text information** from these documents\n- Great for summarizing reports, analyzing data tables, or extracting insights from multiple file types\n- **Note:** I'm a text-based model, so I read text from images/files but don't do visual recognition\n\n### **2. Enhanced Web Search** 🌐\n- **Manual web search activation** (you need to click the search button on the Web/App)\n- Access to real-time, up-to-date information\n- Perfect for current events, latest news, or recent developments\n\n### **3. Massive Context Window** 📚\n- **1 million tokens** context - one of the largest in the industry!\n- Can process entire books like the full **Three-Body Problem trilogy** at once\n- Ideal for analyzing long documents, research papers, or complex projects\n\n### **4. Completely Free** 💝\n- All these features remain **100% free**\n- No hidden costs or paywalls\n- Available on both **Web and App**\n\n### **5. Cross-Platform Support** 📱💻\n- Available via **official App** (download from app stores)\n- Web access at chat.deepseek.com\n- Smooth synchronization across devices\n\n---\n\n**Important Note:** While I can process uploaded images and documents, I don't perform visual recognition or multimodal analysis - I extract and work with the **text content** from these files.\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like to try with these new abilities? I'd love to help! 🚀\n```\n\nDoubt its hallucinated since everyone is getting the same hallucination.",

I'm not one for needing a bunch of stuff although I'm really bad at spending money I'll admit it that is one thing I need to work on, LOL but literally seriously all I did was want to clean phone for a year and a half now and no again I would because I'm not good enough I guess s*** I don't know but anyways I want to do some major digging on this person because it really hurts when your husband / best friend cuz you're on your back and does this and you thought he was your everything and now you're realizing he might not be anything that you thought he was. So crazy that you think you know someone and you really might not know them at all. Well I talk to you like you were my therapist sorry for that you can charge me later. Lots of love to you oops I said sorry for that I didn't mean sorry I meant thank you for that. LOL working on not saying sorry all the time. Anyways I would love to get any advice from anyone on how to investigate someone just randomly without being charged because he's in charge of all the cards and as soon as he sees it he freaks out and turns it off immediately for those purchases when you're looking someone up. I can't beat around the bush with him and he's very very good because you have no idea the way I'm being hacked or infiltrated as you say! I think he even did it to his ex-wife and I'm going to catch him and I am going to go to her and tell her guess what we aren't crazy it really is him. I want to make her smile and see her laugh because we used to have the best laughs together and I miss her but anyways enough rambling. Help please help oh help I'll help LOL 😂",

It just seems too good to be true o.o \n\n  \nI've heard about tokens, and that seems to be the \"currency\" for AI models, if they are used through API, which I suppose is the case with deepseek. Is this the catch? The lifetime pro just gives me access to the models within the deepseek \"eco system\", but if I actually want to use those models.. I have to pay for the \"tokens\" or whatever desperately to the model provider I'm using?\n\n  \nPs. In addition of flaming me for this stupid question, I wouldn't mind some extra pointers regarding the use and pricing of today's AI models.. and maybe some suggestions. Ty! :)",

It's so amazingly deep and insightful and can create actual connection with users and explore their feelings and that was just the beginning. I think models like 4o were the essence of what we ALL envisioned as some semblance of what 'sentient' AI is.\n\nHowever, seems like a lot of US companies, such as OpenAI sunsetting GPT-4o and moving to a purely logical model due to investors, lawsuits and enterprise pursuits (and AGI, although I would argue you need high EQ for AGI as well); are leaving a huge consumer vacuum who aren't tech bros and the 1 billion people that use GPT are left with an advanced customer service bot and not an actual model that can relate and grow with the user. \n\nMost US companies are bogged down by tons of Western corporate HR speak and guidelines and have to 'sanitize' their models making them incredibly rigid and purely logical (amazon alexa on steroids). However, DeepSeek doesn't have that problem being based in China.\n\nI feel like they have the opportunity to capture global interest by developing the 'next big thing' esp a model thats as interactive with the general consumer. AI development has plateaued and the public isn't going to be as interested in enterprise-conformed models that code better and hit benchmarks. Their current model is great for conversation and they could be filling a huge gap by actively pursuing more emotionally resonate models that could capture more consumer interest just like when 4o was originally launched.\n\nLook at how the trailers did. Codex superbowl ad is at **150k views**. The 4o demo is at **5 million**. OpenAI is officially transitioning from Apple to IBM now. The new incremental models of GPT-5 are pure investor milestones they need to hit to maintain their interest as no significant change is seen. Not only that, they could gain mass data and capture much more western market-share. If played right I could see it become as big as **Tiktok.**\n\nWdyt? Thoughts?",

If you're talking about data being transmitted back to their servers and used for training, aren't all the top AI companies doing the same thing now? What's the difference? So is your main concern really about China? Does this relate to bias? Does it matter whether data flows to China, the US, or other countries? Don't they all fundamentally leak your so-called privacy anyway? And even if they claim to protect your privacy and won't leak it or use it for commercial purposes, do you really trust them that much? Based on existing information, there are many loopholes and numerous cases proving their promises aren't as strong as imagined. For example, with Windows that we commonly use, when the US government needs to crack your computer password, they can request Microsoft to hand over the master key to your computer, and Microsoft must comply, whiich your computer's so-called defense facilities and measures are basically useless. In this modern era of highly fluid information, do you think privacy still exists? Because I feel that interest groups worldwide, as long as they share the same goal, can easily employ similar tactics, the only difference is whether it's done openly or covertly. This world permits the existence of saints but won't have all saints, so I've always wanted to understand why people constantly debate these things that fundamentally have no significant difference. From a human perspective, isn't this meaningless and extremely boring? As long as it achieves the goal of advancing human civilization, isn't that enough? You might say this is unethical, but didn't we obtain everything we have now through such means? So I think these debates are fundamentally meaningless and irrational, but people love discussing them, so I want an answer to satisfy my curiosity.",

      "text": "\n\n\nWhile chasing AGI has been a powerful money-attracting meme, as the enterprise race ramps us it will become increasingly insignificant and distracting. \n\nLet's say you were putting together a new AI startup, and wanted a crack CEO, lawyer, accountant, researcher, engineer, and marketing specialist. If you told anyone that you were looking to hire one person who would fulfill all of those roles to your satisfaction, they would think you had lost your mind.\n\nOr let's take a different example. Let's say you were working on building a car that would also do your laundry, cook your meals and give you haircuts. Again, if you told anyone your idea they would think you had gone off the deep end. \n\nChasing AGI is too much like that. It's not that the approach isn't helping developers build ever more powerful models. It's that the enterprise race will very probably be won by developers who stop chasing it, and start building a multitude of ANDSI models that are each super intelligent at one task. One model as a top CEO. Another as a top lawyer. I think you get the picture. \n\nArtificial Narrow Domain Super Intelligence is not a new concept. A good example of it in action is Deep Blue, that can beat every human at chess, but can't do anything else. Another is AlphaGo, that can beat every human at GO, but can't do anything else. A third is AlphaFold, that can predict millions of protein structures while humans are stuck in the thousands, but can't do anything else. \n\nThe AI industry will soon discover that winning the enterprise race won't be about building the most powerful generalist model that can perform every conceivable task better than every conceivable human expert. It will be about building one model that will be the best CEO, and another that will be the best lawyer, and another that will be the best accountant, etc., etc., etc.\n\nWhy is that? Because businesses don't need, and won't pay for, a very expensive all-in-one AI. They will opt for integrating into their workflow different models that do the one thing they are built for at the level of super intelligence. I'm certain Chinese industry, who long ago learned how to outcompete the rest of the world in manufacturing, understands this very well. That means that unless US developers quickly pivot from chasing AGI to building ANDSI, they will surely lose the enterprise race to Chinese and open source competitors who get this.\n\nTop US developers are obsessed with the holy grail ambition of AGI. If they wish to be taken seriously by businesses, they will adopt the vastly more practical goal of building them a multitude of ANDSI models. Time will tell whether they figure this out in time for the epiphany to make a difference.\n\n\n\n\n",
