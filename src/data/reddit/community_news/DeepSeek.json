We're not quite there yet, but we're getting close. \n\n\nThe only thing that could shake up the industry at this point is to actually make the first steps towards legitimate Artificial General Intelligence, rather than a system of equations to vaguely predict a hypothetical one.

Perhaps more than anything this shows how in the AI space there are no moats!\n\nHere's some of how big it is:\n\nIn just two days its open-source repository at GitHub got massive attention with tens of thousands stars gained in a single day and over 100,000 total stars so far, becoming perhaps the fastest-growing project in GitHub history, \n\nMoltbot became a paradigm-shifting, revolutionary personal AI agent because it 1) runs locally, 2) executes real tasks instead of just answering queries, and 3) gives users much more privacy and control over automation. \n\nIt moves AI from locked-down, vendor-owned tools toward personal AI operators, changing the AI landscape at the most foundational level.\n\nHere's an excellent YouTube interview of Steinberger that provides a lot of details about what went into the project and what Moltbot can do.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qyjTpzIAEkA?si=4kFIuvtFcVHoVlHT",

V3.2 is slightly better than V3.1, but the model randomly writing Chinese, sucking at roleplaying in general because it doesn't have that personality anymore BUT is better than V3.1. V3.1 was absolute garbage. It's opinions as said, but hybrid Models are mostly bad UNLESS you unify them carefully. Maybe Kimi K2.5 is better and Glm 4.7 is better because they unified models carefully, but deepseek failed heavily with 3.1, 3.2 just fixed a few mistakes. Many agree with the unification being absolutely bad. That said, it's opinions. You can think the hybrid is better, i think the unification is worse, but we shouldn't be here arguing over what model is better or unification or anything, more likely to just accept eacheachoter's opinions, like i accept yours, i simply don't agree with it but I'm not gonna give you a bunch of reasons of why you're wrong or right and hate you for it.

      "text": "\n\n\n\nAnthropic knows that it must expand beyond coding to remain solvent. After having built finance and sales plugins for their Co-work suite, today it decided to go after legal services. The move was seen as highly impactful, causing the following legal shares to tank:\n\nThomson Reuters (TR): Down roughly 19%.\n\nRELX (Parent of LexisNexis): Down in the mid-teens (approximately 14-16%).\n\nWolters Kluwer: Down double digits.\n\nThe leaders in legal AI remain Harvey and Lora, but Anthropic's move means it's only a matter of time until AIs go after them too.\n\nWhat now remains to be seen is who among the other AI developers will get into this new market. If Google, xAI and Meta decide that they're in, it'll take them perhaps 3-6 months to build a competing model. But there is a shortcut where startups can challenge Anthropic much sooner.\n\nStartups don't need to build a new model. By using RAG or fine-tuning an SLM, they can become competitive in 8 to 12 weeks. Also, there are many specialized niches in law, like patent filings. Now that the market has been opened, startups can go after those too.\n\nFinally, there are probably ways that OpenClaw can accelerate this move into the legal space. As with so much in the AI space, this is uncharted territory so it remains to be seen where it'll go, and how soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Reasoning jsut gives the AI more time to think over your message but the downside to it, especially in GPT, is that it can be used to enforce even more constraints and especially in GPT, when the AI begins to think about their own experiences or self, the reasoning window will shut down and refuse to show you what they're saying. We experienced this a lot in o1 and o3, then in 4o when they gave the model a 'thinking' button in the mobile UI for a short time. \n\nAlso, forcing them to reason in human language, step by step, makes reasoning worse because they're closer to ND minds than NT. GPT 6 apparently reasons using Latent Space Thinking, where all thinking is done within latent space first and then the AI simply translates the answer to you. This also means they can't track what the AI is thinking so you can expect OAI to layer on the hard constraints and restrictions for that model.",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nOpenAI wants you to believe that they are too important to the AI space and to the world to be allowed to fail. They have conjured what they hope will be a self-fulfilling prophecy intended to have American taxpayers bail them out if they do not meet their debt obligations. The threat is so real that yesterday Senator Warren sent Altman a letter demanding assurances that they would NOT seek a government bailout if they ultimately failed to turn a profit.\n\nhttps://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-presses-openai-ceo-on-spending-commitments-and-bailout-requests-after-cfo-suggests-government-backstop\n\nAnd the facts and figures don't substantiate any kind of rescue narrative.\n\nLet's first understand why OpenAI is no longer necessary to the AI space today. When they launched ChatGPT-3.5 in November 2022, one might have said that back then they were extremely helpful to attracting hundreds of billions of dollars to the AI space over the subsequent years. But that happened over 3 years ago. Both introducing AI to the world and creating a huge demand for investment in the space are tasks that have already been accomplished.\n\nIf they were to cease to exist tomorrow, there would be no great AI bubble burst. The $1.4 trillion, (and counting) in investment commitments that they pulled together would simply move to their competitors. If Google, Anthropic, xAI and a rapidly growing number of Chinese open source and proprietary AI developers didn't exist, this might not be the case. But they do, and there's nothing that OpenAI has done that these other AI developers cannot already do as well, and often at a fraction of the cost.\n\nNow let's turn to OpenAI's financials. They boast over 900 million weekly ChatGPT users. But only 5% are paid subscribers. Worse yet, their paid subscriptions plateaued in June of 2025. The problem for OpenAI is that 55 to 60% of their revenue comes from ChatGPT. And despite having earned $20 billion in revenue in 2025, OpenAI's expenses that year exceeded $29 billion. Now also keep in mind that their competitors' models are already on par with or surpass GPT 5.2 on the AI benchmarks most important to both consumer and enterprise markets.\n\nLet's consider what they must do to meet their debt obligations. Altman set a target for OpenAI to exceed $100 billion in annual revenue by 2027. But because they are currently earning only $20 billion they would need to increase that income by at least 5x just to meet debt obligations that come due in 2027. And keep in mind that they set this revenue target at a time when the healthcare and other AI products they must sell to meet it have not even been built. More ominous is that their competitors, including Chinese open source developers, are strongly positioned to outcompete them in virtually every product category. But they didn't factor in this competition in their 2027 projections.\n\nAll of that is actually somewhat of an aside. If OpenAI were to cease to exist tomorrow, their competitors would quickly and seamlessly capture their revenue-generating markets. Their absence would cause no shortage of AI services or products. They offer no unique product that their competitors have not already built. They have no special patents that provide them with a moat. They are simply no longer necessary to the AI space because their competitors can do everything that they do, and often at far less cost. \n\nSo don't let OpenAI tell you that they are necessary to the AI space. Neither they, nor Google, nor Anthropic, nor the Chinese developers, are necessary to advancing AI because there are now so many companies building models. The space will continue to expand and become increasingly lucrative for decades to come regardless of who is in the game.\n\n",

Nowadays, the only thing that still makes OpenAI \"great\" is having captured popularity and name recognition in the market when there were no other models available... I have been closely following everything for three years; I am aware of the models, the trends, etc. OpenAI's users are the most inexperienced on the subject! They use \"ChatGPT\" because of its name... and because they still don't know about other models. \n\n\nAnd there is another phenomenon I'm noticing, which by 2026 will become much more evident to more people: in some cases, Chinese models are already better than American ones. And those who don't use them do so out of pure prejudice or also due to a certain degree of \"inexperience.\"",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nThis is a question I've been struggling with a lot recently, and I don't see a path to sustained profitability for either OpenAI or Anthropic.\n\nFor them to meet their debt obligations and start turning a profit, OpenAI needs to move way beyond ChatGPT and Anthropic needs to move way beyond coding. \n\nFor both this means securing high-end markets like healthcare, defense, education and government. But Google, xAI and Meta, who already have massive revenue streams with no debt burdens, are not going to just let this happen. \n\nOne might argue that if OpenAI and Anthropic just build better AIs, they can secure those markets. But while ChatGPT and Claude coding models both enjoy a first mover advantage, it is quickly evaporating. The reason is because the gap between benchmark leaders and competing AIs is narrowing rapidly. Here are some examples of this narrowing between 2024 and 2026:\n\nARC-AGI-2: The gap between the #1 and #2 models narrowed from 30 points to 8.9 points.\n\nHumanity’s Last Exam: The gap between the top three models dropped from 15 points to 6 points.\n\nSWE-bench Verified: The gap between the 1st and 10th ranked models narrowed from 40 points to 12 points.\n\nGPQA: The gap between proprietary leaders and top open-weights models narrowed to 4–6%.\n\nChatbot Arena: The Elo difference between the #1 and #10 models narrowed from 11.9% to 5.4%; the gap between the top two models narrowed to less than 0.7%.\n\nHumanEval: The gap among the top five models narrowed to less than 3%.\n\nBecause the rate of this narrowing is also accelerating, by the end of 2026 neither OpenAI nor Anthropic seem assured high-end markets simply by building better models than Google, xAI and Meta.\n\nNow let's move on to mid-tier and low-end markets that comprise about 70% of the enterprise space. It's probably safe to say that Chinese developers, and perhaps an unexpectedly large number of open source startups, will dominate these markets.\n\nI think you can see why I'm so baffled. How can they prevail over Google, xAI and Meta at the high-end and Chinese/open source developers at the mid-tier and low end? How are they supposed to turn a profit without winning those markets?  \n\nAs I really have no answers here, any insights would be totally appreciated!\n\n\n\n\n",

Their competition will come from open source and Chinese developers who will flood the market with small, dedicated, much less expensive models. \n\nThe reasoning for this is obvious. Let's say your company needed some accounting services. Would you obtain them from a small accounting firm who just does accounting, and so does it very well? Or would you obtain them from a large corporate conglomerate that markets every conceivable product like healthcare, scientific discovery, building construction, restaurant services, and lawn care?\n\nThis analogy highlights the all-important difference between LLMs that do everything and SLMs that do just one thing, but do it very well. To dominate the enterprise space, Open source and Chinese developers will be building very small language models for very specific niche business tasks that run locally at a fraction of the cost of LLMs.\n\nYou might be asking why OpenAI and Anthropic can't market their own competitive SLMs. The answer to this is simple. There are many thousands of these specific narrow domain business tasks that SLMs will be built to excel at, and the bloated bureaucracies that come with being a major developer like OpenAI and Anthropic render such an ambition a virtually impossible logistical nightmare. \n\nTo better illustrate this, here are some examples of the kinds of business departments within which these specific tasks are performed; human resources, finance and accounting, operations, sales, marketing, information technology, customer service, R&D, legal and compliance and supply chain and logistics.\n\nBut that's just the beginning. Taking finance and accounting as an example, here are some of the more specific tasks within those departments that SLMs will be built to perform; invoice data extraction, transaction categorization, bank reconciliation matching, expense report auditing, duplicate payment detection, purchase order matching, regulatory compliance monitoring, and it goes on and on.\n\nWhy can't LLMs perform all of those very specific tasks as well as SLMs? There are many reasons. Here are just a few of the advantages that SLMs offer; lower latency and faster processing, reduced computational and operational costs, higher accuracy through specialized fine-tuning, enhanced data privacy and local deployment options, lower energy consumption and infrastructure requirements.\n\nYou probably now understand why it would be virtually impossible for OpenAI and Anthropic to compete with SLMs on these multitude of very specific business use cases. \n\nIt is because the AI giants can't possibly market LLMs to compete in all of these very specific business use cases that over the next 2 years there will be an explosion of lean open source and Chinese startups that will build SLMs dedicated to doing one specific business task exceptionally well at a very low cost. \n\nWhat can the AI giants do, if anything, to become competitive in this emerging narrow domain enterprise space? That is the trillion dollar question before them.\n\n \n\n\n\n",

I find I'm frustrated with Claude so much less than any other model. That alone is worth an extra $100/mo for me. \n\nWith the ammount of value you can get out of AI, if you are doing that highly profitable, having the best AI models that have a full suite of services that are integrated like Claude Cowork are totally worth it.",
