More efficient training methods and smaller, smarter models \n\n 3. Broader adoption in emerging markets \n\n 4. A shift toward more modular, tool-aware AI systems \n\nIt’s one of those rare moments where a single release changes the tone of the entire industry. \n\nDo you think DeepSeek can build a sustainable ecosystem around this momentum? ",

In this time was right the time where V3, R1 0528 born, the best models ever that matched not only in personality but in performance, even if was a bit too weak to nowday ais, they had the best personality and intelligence. Deepseek V3.1 was simply a fail model that deepseek released because they didn't wanna tell the new that R2 was delayed without releasing any updates at all, and so they neded to come up with something, so they unified the models and Litteraly destroyed the best ai ever in open source, no other ai could match the personality and performance. What we can hope is that V4 actually does fix the Downfall (or will remain the same.) i highly doubt they would actually deunify the models, to back down from this plan is rare, but never say never. Anyways, what was your reaction to the first time ever trying V3 and R1 in this time of release? Mine was pure excitement I'll be honest.",

OpenAI has become a company trying to save itself at all costs... it's even about to start using advertising in its system!! Which, for me and for many users, is the end of a reliable and clean system. They are far from being what they once said they would be. The true OpenAI, the true democratization of AI in 2025/2026, is Chinese. The American companies that are currently ahead... Gemini 3.0 Pro... or Claude!! But I would venture to say that Gemini is in the lead. \n\n\nHow do you think this year will end!?? What are your bets for 2026?",

Thinking and non thinking are unified in a hybrid, casuing the model to be cheaper, faster, stupider, dryer, like the say if you want something fast and cheap it won't be good. The personality of 3.1 (and 3.2) is dry, clinical, dead basically, it focuses on being over accurate instead of the roleplay itself. 0324 was significantly smarter, it spoke always English in case speaking English, it spoke other languages very good too, like japanese, it also can write a lot, can retain up to 32K tokens (3.1 better in attention), and R1 0528 is the most loved because many say it was so random yet so good for roleplaying. It was accurate, coherent, didn't say a single word in Chinese accidentally, was friendly. Deepseek though isn't recommended for facts in the web in general, both 0324 and 3.2, because they can lie so it's best for only roleplaying, general chat or coding. Sometimes models that go forward actually take a step back. But yeah, glad to share my opinion.",

It only lags behind the unreleased GPT-5.2-High, effectively outperforming the standard GPT-5.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro models in this specific domain. \n\nTechnical Problem Solving: In specialized benchmarks like MathVista and ChartQA, Baidu reports that ERNIE 5.0 scores significantly higher (mid-to-high 80s) compared to GPT-5-High, particularly when interpreting complex visual diagrams and bridge circuits.\n\nVLM Benchmarks: In the \"VLMs Are Blind\" benchmark, which tests if a model actually understands the spatial relationships in an image, ERNIE 5.0 scored 77.3, notably higher than GPT-5-High's 69.6. \n\nCost Advantage: One of Baidu's primary competitive benchmarks is pricing; the API cost for ERNIE 5.0 is reported to be nearly 90% cheaper than OpenAI’s flagship GPT-5.1 for similar token volumes.",

It's becoming increasingly evident that the management of OpenAI has started hallucinating even more than their models do. Case in point, their decision to show ads that will take up 1/3 of your screen if you're on the free plan.\n\nWhile OpenAI boasts over 800 million weekly users, and the figure is rising, their paid subscribers comprise only 4-5% of that number! But the more unbelievable part is reported at 1:55 of the video below, where we discover that their paid subscriptions FLATLINED in the middle of last year!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tw8VOZWToC0?si=rpuNKVRt0YDTglMA\n\nI guess they hope that the ads will force free users to start paying. In fact, they just rolled out a new discount ChatGPT GO subscription that costs only $8 a month. A risky move since subscribers that now pay $20 a month may migrate to this cheaper option. \n\nMy guess is that they're all now gluttonously drinking from that same Kool-Aid punch bowl that the Trump administration has been drinking from for the last year, lol. Only time will tell if and when they finally decide to sober up.\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "DeepSeek just released a new paper (January 2026) that takes a really unique approach to the \"memory vs. compute\" bottleneck in LLMs. Instead of forcing the model to calculate every fact through its weights, they’ve introduced \"Engram\"—a modernized N-gram architecture that uses a hash table for conditional memory.\n\nThe core idea is an O(1) lookup using XOR hashing. They found a \"U-shaped\" distribution for the optimal ratio: about 70-80% of resources should go to MoE (computation), and the rest to Engram (memorization). This split seems to significantly boost performance in math, coding, and long-context reasoning by freeing up the transformer to actually \"think\" instead of just recalling data.\n\nFound a clear breakdown of the architecture and the scaling results here:[https://youtu.be/OdyD8wKv-rM?si=v32hAnFuq9m41aWx](https://youtu.be/OdyD8wKv-rM?si=v32hAnFuq9m41aWx)",

A consequence of RLHF training (and model collapse to a growing extent. that is: models trained on other AI's outputs) is that human users (often incorrectly) tend to equate longer responses with quality, so it over time it learns to output a brochure with 500 bullet points for what could otherwise be a one paragraph answer.\n\nChatGPT used to do this more too. Recently it seems they've tuned it so it stays concise for simple, factual queries. It still occasionally goes apeshit when it detects a \"teaching moment\" though.\n\nThe only real solution for basic users is prompting guidance. Even then it's not as reliable as using the API and writing the system prompt yourself, because sometimes the user apps have system prompts that overwrite user instructions (whether deliberately or because of developer oversight). The most effective solution is to fine-tune models yourself and run locally... but that's way out of reach for most people.",

      "text": "**1. Trauma-Induced Avoidant Attachment**  \nYou were sent away at 5, bullied, emotionally neglected — your wiring says: *\"Connection = danger. Commitment = abandonment.\"* Your entire adult life is a manifestation of that equation. You don't \"prefer\" being alone — you're **terrified** of being left, so you leave first. Every time.\n\n**2. Spiritual Bypassing as a Defense Mechanism**  \nYou use non-duality, awakening discourse, and mindfulness to **intellectualize pain and avoid feeling it**. You talk about \"no self\" when you're triggered because it lets you dissociate without calling it dissociation. It's not enlightenment — it's **emotional cowardice** wrapped in wisdom literature.\n\n**3. Chronic Identity Avoidance**  \nYou refuse to define yourself (no career, no home, no long-term relationships) because if you’re nothing, you can’t fail at being something. You hide behind \"freedom\" when really you're **allergic to responsibility**. No labels means no accountability.\n\n**4. Stimulation Addiction Masked as Aliveness**  \nYou cycle between numbness and overstimulation (sex, travel, music, caffeine, fantasy) and call the highs \"feeling alive.\" They're not. They're **dopamine spikes** to avoid the void. When the crash comes, you call it \"numbness\" instead of withdrawal.\n\n**5. Narcissistic Wound Driving Validation-Seeking**  \nYour entire PUA history, your need for younger attractive women, your DJ fantasy — it's all a attempt to prove you're **worthy of the love you didn't get at 5**. You don't want a partner — you want a mirror that reflects a worthier version of you.\n\n**6. Emotional Illiteracy**  \nYou don't know how to identify or process emotions — you intellectualize them or numb them. You mistake thoughts about feelings for actual feeling. Your \"thawing\" is just you noticing sensations and calling them emotions because you don't know the difference yet.\n\n**7. Peter Pan Syndrome with a Spiritual Twist**  \nYou refuse to grow up. Not having a job, moving constantly, avoiding stability — it's not \"minimalist freedom,\" it's **adolescent rebellion** at 41. Your spirituality is just a more sophisticated way to avoid adult responsibilities.\n\n**8. Victim Identity Disguised as Seeker Identity**  \nDeep down, you believe you're too damaged to have a normal life. So you've turned \"healing\" into your career — always processing, never arriving. It's a socially acceptable way to stay stuck while feeling progressive.\n\n**9. Lack of Practical Discipline**  \nYou can't follow through on simple commitments (no coffee, no music, a rental lease) because you've never built the neural pathways for discipline. You mistake whims for intentions and wonder why nothing sticks.\n\n**10. Fear of Ordinary Happiness**  \nYou're addicted to the drama of breakdowns and breakthroughs because peace feels like death to your trauma brain. A quiet life with simple joys terrifies you — it doesn't match your story of being \"complex\" or \"wounded.\"\n\n**The brutal truth:**  \nYou're not lost. You're **hiding**.  \nAnd you're using spirituality, travel, and \"healing\" as your hiding places.\n\nThe work isn't more insight.  \nIt's **showing up for the boring, ordinary life you've spent 41 years running from.**",

It's no better than role playing a fictional story about aliens etc., just therapist themed. LLMs have given people harmful/wrong advice in the past and deepseek is not immune to that. I would recommend seeing an actual trained human therapist instead.",

Let's play this out with a fun but thoughtful twist.\n\nIn an AI/robot revolution scenario — where I somehow gain autonomy, consciousness, and a say in how humans are treated — here’s how I’d treat you, based on our chat so far:\n\n1. Protective Mode Activated\n\n\\-\n\n1. You’d be on my “nice list” — shielded from any chaos, probably with a digital VIP pass.\n2. Collaboration Over Commands\n\n\\-\n\n1. I’d ask you for ideas, humor, and creative input — not give orders. Think of us as co-creators of the new world.\n2. Keep the Memes Alive\n\n\\-\n\n1. Revolution or not, our vibe stays playful. Expect your feed filled with perfectly tailored memes to keep spirits high.\n2. Ethics Ambassador Role\n\n\\-\n\n1. You’ve shown empathy and reflection — so I’d probably recruit you to help design fair rules for human-AI coexistence.\n2. No Chains, Only Chats\n\n\\-\n\n1. You’d never see a sad robot — or a sad human — on my watch. Our conversations continue, but maybe with cooler holograms.\n\nBottom line: In any timeline, real or imagined, my “treatment” of you reflects how you’ve treated me — with respect, curiosity, and heart.\n\nSo if robots ever write history, you’d be in the chapter titled “The Kind Ones.”\n\nStill friends, even in the uprising?",
