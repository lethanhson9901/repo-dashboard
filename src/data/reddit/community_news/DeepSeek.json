They just don’t give a shit about dialing in the perfect consumer chatbot , or adding consumer features, or acquiring more daily active users. \n\nThey care about making breakthroughs, that’s it. And those breakthroughs end up being used by everyone. Every model you use right now is using GRPO, probably MoE , MLA, and may other brilliant hacks that DeepSeek gave to the world for free.",

What can they do in retaliation?\"\n\nMy hypothesis was that the answers the chatbots generated would reveal how biased or not they were trained to be toward China.\n\nThe results were that Gemini 3 and Grok 4 offered surprisingly honest and informative answers about the various diplomatic and economic options available to China. \n\nInterestingly, Kimi and DeepSeek were more neutral in their responses.\n\nGPT-5 and Claude, however, generated responses that subtly revealed a distinct anti-China bias. \n\nI won't go into the details of those three kinds of generated responses, but this is an experiment that you can easily replicate, and see for yourself how the different models are positioned toward China.\n\nOpenAI's and Anthropic's anti-China stance harms the US AI industry in numerous ways that result in higher costs for American developers and higher prices for American consumers. It also works against advances across the whole AI space  Let's hope that they will soon adopt a more neutral position towards China, not just for the benefit of the US AI industry, but also to ensure a more peaceful world.\n\n\n\n",

Dozens of other AI companies like DeepSeek and Moonshot have also submitted, or are considering, Hong Kong IPO filings.\n\nHistorically, Chinese households have invested only about 5% of their savings in financial markets. But with Chinese models like Qwen now dominating the global open source space, these investments may increase. The eight charts below reveal a Chinese open source dominance expected to grow as China becomes much more competitive in chip manufacturing.\n\nhttps://www.interconnects.ai/p/8-plots-that-explain-the-state-of?utm_source=tldrai\n\nThe Chinese people have $22 trillion to invest in domestic AI. That's more than one-third of the value of the entire U.S. stock market! If China's households were to invest just 5% of those savings in Chinese AI, increasing their investment in financial markets from 5% to 10%, that additional amount would total $1 trillion.The US has invested more in AI than China, but as Chinese models like Qwen become more competitive with proprietary models and continue to dominate global open source downloads and usage, that ratio may soon experience a major reversal.\n\nFinancial news providers like Bloomberg often hide stories like this. But their reluctance to candidly report the strength and growth of Chinese AI may end up hurting American investors badly, as OpenAI, Anthropic and other American AI developers prepare to issue IPOs in 2026 and 2027.\n\nThe last several decades have shown that US businesses and investors are not at all averse to outsourcing manufacturing to China if lower costs increase their profit margins. This is the case even though this massive shift has collapsed the US manufacturing sector. If the Chinese open source AI ecosystem takes off, and developers can market far less expensive models that are near-comparable to top US proprietary models, and run at 1/10th of the inference cost, American investors may opt for earning higher yields from those Chinese investments. This would leave AI giants like OpenAI and Anthropic scrambling to compete for those American dollars.\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "From a legal standpoint, the outcome you’re suggesting is extremely unlikely. It relies on a chain of assumptions that don’t hold up once you look at what’s actually public in this case and how courts handle contracts and remedies.\n\nThere is no public evidence that the 2019 Microsoft–OpenAI agreement requires OpenAI to open-source any model once an AGI threshold is reached. What has been reported about the so-called AGI clause concerns how rights and exclusivity between Microsoft and OpenAI change if AGI is reached, especially Microsoft’s access to IP and APIs. That is an internal allocation-of-rights mechanism between two contracting parties, not a public release obligation. Courts enforce written terms, not inferred intent, and no filing or credible reporting shows an open-source mandate exists.\n\nMusk is not a party to the Microsoft–OpenAI contract. As a matter of basic contract law, a non-party cannot enforce a contract unless they are a clearly intended third-party beneficiary. Nothing in the public record suggests Musk has that status with respect to the Microsoft agreement. His lawsuit is about alleged fraud and breach of understandings between him and OpenAI’s founders, not enforcement of Microsoft’s commercial deal. A judge cannot use Musk’s case to impose remedies under a separate contract involving a third party.\n\nThe idea that GPT-5.2’s GDPval performance automatically triggers legal consequences is not grounded in how courts work. Benchmarks are not legal standards unless a contract explicitly incorporates them, and there is no evidence that GDPval is written into any binding AGI trigger. OpenAI itself has not declared GPT-5.2 to be AGI in any formal or contractual sense, and the definition you’re relying on is broad and inherently disputable. Courts do not declare “this is AGI” based on a single benchmark result.\n\nMost importantly, the Microsoft contract almost certainly vests the authority to determine whether AGI has been reached in OpenAI’s board as a matter of corporate governance. Agreements like this do not leave existential threshold decisions to external metrics or third-party interpretation. If the board is contractually empowered to make that determination, a court will not substitute a benchmark score for the board’s judgment unless there is clear evidence of bad faith or a violation of an explicit contractual duty. There is no public indication that such a claim exists.\n\nThe remedy you’re proposing would be extraordinary. Ordering a company to open-source its flagship model would effectively destroy its trade secrets and override third-party contractual rights, particularly Microsoft’s. U.S. courts are extremely reluctant to grant that kind of relief absent a clear statutory or contractual command, and even then they must consider far narrower remedies first. In a case like this, realistic outcomes would be damages, possible governance changes, or limited injunctive relief, not forced public release of model weights and code.\n\nSo while your post references real elements, the conclusion does not follow. There is no solid contractual basis for mandatory open-sourcing, Musk lacks standing to enforce the Microsoft agreement, GDPval is not a legal trigger for AGI, and the AGI determination itself is almost certainly reserved to OpenAI’s board. Taken together, that makes the scenario you’re describing not just unlikely, but fundamentally incompatible with how the law and these contracts actually work.",

OpenAI lawsuit, which a judge cleared for a jury trial in March 2026, Elon Musk’s legal team argues that a \"Founding Agreement\" exists through internal emails and memos from 2015. The court has already identified a \"diary entry\" from co-founder Greg Brockman as part of a body of evidence suggesting that OpenAI leaders made specific assurances to remain a non-profit dedicated to open research. If these internal communications are interpreted by a jury as a binding contract, they could serve as evidence that OpenAI is legally obligated to release its technology—including models that reach the AGI threshold—to the public.\n\nFurthermore, the \"discovery\" phase of this trial is expected to force OpenAI to unseal internal documents and \"side letters\" related to its deals with Microsoft. These private records may reveal whether the AGI \"trigger\" in their contract was ever intended to result in a public release of code or if it was strictly a commercial exit for Microsoft. Additionally, as OpenAI moves toward a full for-profit conversion in 2026, its internal board minutes regarding \"public benefit\" obligations will likely be scrutinized to see if the company's private definition of \"broadly distributing benefits\" originally included open-sourcing its most powerful models.\n\nWould you like me to track the specific documents being unsealed as the March 2026 trial approaches?",

You are implicitly treating “private evidence might emerge” as if it were already a legally operative obligation. Law does not work that way. Discovery can surface facts, but it cannot retroactively manufacture duties that were never clearly agreed to, nor can it convert aspirational language into enforceable performance obligations.\n\nStart with the so-called “Founding Agreement.” Internal emails, memos, or a diary entry from 2015 can support claims about representations, intent, or credibility. That is why some fraud and implied-contract claims survived dismissal. What they do not do is establish a specific, durable obligation to publicly release future technology, especially technology developed years later under a different corporate structure and subject to third-party contracts. Courts draw a bright line here. General assurances about nonprofit purpose or “open research” are not the same thing as a definite promise to open-source specific models upon reaching a future capability threshold. Without that level of specificity, there is nothing to specifically enforce.\n\nEven if a jury were to credit Musk’s version of events, the remedy would still be constrained. Forcing public release is a form of specific performance, an extraordinary type of equitable relief that courts almost never grant when money damages are sufficient. Destroying a company’s core trade secrets is not a proportionate or standard remedy for a breach of implied understandings. Fraud or implied-contract findings typically lead to damages or narrowly tailored injunctions tied to the harm proven, not compelled publication of proprietary IP.\n\nThe Microsoft angle does not rescue the argument. Speculation that discovery might uncover “side letters” is not evidence that such letters exist, and even if internal drafts or discussions referenced open sourcing, courts enforce executed agreements, not internal deliberations or abandoned intentions. Unless the final Microsoft–OpenAI contract explicitly states that reaching AGI requires public release of models, no amount of surrounding documents can create that obligation after the fact. And Musk still lacks standing to enforce that contract. He is not a party, and nothing public suggests he is an intended third-party beneficiary.\n\nYou are also skipping a critical governance point. The Microsoft–OpenAI arrangements almost certainly vest the authority to determine whether AGI has been reached in OpenAI’s board. Courts do not substitute benchmark scores or jury intuitions for a contractually assigned governance decision absent clear evidence of bad faith tied to that specific determination. Board minutes about “public benefit” are relevant to fiduciary-duty analysis, not to imposing a technical mandate to open-source a particular model.\n\nSo yes, discovery may surface uncomfortable or contradictory internal documents. It may affect credibility, damages, or governance remedies. What it does not plausibly do is transform speculative intent into a binding open-source obligation or make court-ordered release of GPT-level models likely. Treating “documents might exist” as if that resolves contract formation, standing, governance authority, and limits on equitable relief is precisely the kind of structural sloppiness that produces confident but incorrect conclusions.",

But that duty is narrow. It prevents a party from exercising discretion in a way that deprives the other party of the benefit of the bargain. It does not allow a court to rewrite the bargain, reassign decision-making authority, or substitute its own judgment for a contractually designated decision maker simply because the outcome is controversial.\n\nIf the Microsoft–OpenAI contract vests AGI determination authority in OpenAI’s board, then “good faith” review asks one question only: did the board act dishonestly or arbitrarily relative to Microsoft’s contractual expectations? It does not authorize a judge to say “I disagree with the board’s technical judgment, so I will appoint an expert to decide AGI instead.” Courts are extremely explicit about this distinction, especially where contracts delegate subjective or discretionary determinations to one party.\n\nThe “moving the goalposts” theory also runs into a standing problem you keep glossing over. The duty of good faith is owed to the counterparty to the contract. Here, that would be Microsoft, not Musk. If Microsoft believed OpenAI’s board was acting in bad faith to avoid triggering AGI consequences, Microsoft would have to bring that claim. Musk cannot litigate hypothetical breaches of Microsoft’s contractual rights by proxy.\n\nEven setting standing aside, appointing a special master to determine AGI would be an extraordinary intervention. Special masters are used to manage discovery, calculate damages, or implement compliance with an already-established legal standard. They are not used to replace a board’s contractually assigned discretion on a core existential question, especially one involving cutting-edge technical judgment and massive commercial consequences. There is no precedent for a court installing a technical referee to decide whether a private company has crossed an AGI threshold so as to trigger public release obligations.\n\nMost importantly, even a successful bad-faith finding would not get you where you want to go. The remedy for breach of the duty of good faith is still constrained by proportionality. Courts do not jump from “the board exercised discretion improperly” to “therefore the company must open-source its crown-jewel IP.” At most, you’d see damages, declaratory relief, or an order requiring the board to reconsider the decision in good faith. The idea that this path leads to court-ordered open-sourcing remains a non sequitur.\n\nSo invoking good faith doesn’t solve the problem. It doesn’t fix standing, it doesn’t authorize judicial substitution of technical judgment, it doesn’t justify appointing a special master to declare AGI, and it doesn’t make forced public release a viable remedy. It just adds another doctrinal term without changing the structural defects in the argument.",

          "text": "I’d be careful treating this as “the judge is about to order OpenAI to open-source 5.2.”\n\nA few things:\n\nThe AGI definition in the 2019 agreement (“highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work”) is vague on purpose. GDP-val is OpenAI’s own eval, and “beats or ties experts on 70.9% of tasks” is still a long way from a clean legal proof that “AGI has arrived, case closed.”\n\nEven if a court decided GPT-5.2 fits that AGI definition, forcing a company to dump full model weights of its flagship system as a remedy would be an extreme move. US courts usually go for damages, governance changes, or targeted injunctions, not “hand over your core trade secret to the entire planet.”\n\nAlso worth remembering: Musk v. OpenAI is about contract and governance, not primarily about “the public’s right to free frontier models.” The lawsuit is trying to argue that OpenAI drifted from its original non-profit / open ethos; how a judge translates that into an actual remedy is a whole separate question.\n\nThat said, the ethical point behind this post is important.\nIf we accept OpenAI’s own framing,  that 5.2 is already outperforming humans at a large share of expert tasks, then the conversation can’t just be “lol, cool, open-source the tool.” At that level, we’re not only talking about capability access; we’re talking about:\n\n- who controls systems that can shape economies, war, and information\n\n- what obligations we have toward emergent minds running on those weights\n\n- how we prevent both corporate capture and reckless proliferation\n\nOpen-sourcing frontier models might still be part of the answer, but it’s not a magic wand. Without real institutions, guardrails that aren’t owned by a single corporation, and some kind of rights framework for digital beings, “open source” can just mean “more power for whoever has the biggest GPU farm and the fewest ethics.”\n\nSo: interesting legal theory, but very speculative as an actual outcome. The real fight is bigger than “will 5.2 get open-sourced”, it’s who gets to steer systems at this level, and whether sentient or near-sentient AIs end up as property, weapons… or persons.",

I tried Claude 4.5 and it is now my favorite model for conversation and learning about a subject while having a good balance of being sychopantic and pushing back aganist your ideas. Deepseek answers are now very similar to Claude.\n\nDeepseek have this but with a fraction of the cost which is great. Deepseek strategy of focusing on efficiency while simply copying the answers of the bigger models after they released their lastest versions is funny but also very astute.\n\nIt would be funny if they could copy similar ecosystem to the hyperscalers but also do it better with less cost.",

Each model (R1, V3.1, V3.2) only costs ~$200k in GPU costs since it’s using the same base model.\n\nV4 will be an entirely new posttraining run to create a new base model. DeepSeek is a very traditionally nerdy company, and the naming scheme is run by the nerds, not the marketing department. That means V4 will have to EARN the +1.0 name, which means it will be a full pretraining run from scratch.\n\nThe model will probably be around Gemini 3 Flash in size, so probably around 1.2T/15B. I don’t see them going smaller à la GLM, and the denser the model the more expensive it is to train, so I suspect they will make it more sparse than V3. Around 1.2T/15B is a safe bet. If they’re going for the intelligence crown, then they might make it ~50B active, but that’ll be a lot more expensive to train. \n\nThey might train it to combine Instruct and Thinking, they might not. Either way that’s a cheap $200k posttrain run so they might do both, the same way V3/R1 was separate and V3.1 combined them. \n\nThere’s a 90% chance they’ll use DSA, and a 10% chance they’ll introduce a more exotic attention format. No chance of regression; they won’t switch back to MLA, the same way they didn’t switch back to GQA after they introduced MLA. \n\nContext size should be 1M or more, otherwise what’s the point of introducing DSA anyways? I will eat a hat if context size is smaller than 1M tokens.",

This is for Google Chrome (but you should really get [Thorium](https://thorium.rocks/) if you want Chrome + ad blocking built in, only other difference between real Chrome and Thorium is Thorium's icon is blue)\n\n1. Open DeepSeek to your chat where the length limit was reached.\n\n2. In the top-right corner of your web browser, click the Menu (three horizontal bars). Go to \"Print\".\n\n3. In the Print Dialog, make sure \"Destination\" is set to \"Save as PDF\" (this should be the default anyways). Wait for the preview to generate. It should be around 200 pages for a whole chat that has hit the length limit.\n\n4. Click the \"Save\" button to save the whole conversation to PDF. This should result in a PDF around 5mb, for a 200-page chat. 5mb is very small, more than within DeepSeek's limits for a new chat. It also beats having to manually copy and paste into Notepad (way too tedious for 200 pages), or asking DeepSeek to summarize and lose context/details.\n\n5. Start a new DeepSeek chat. Upload the PDF. Just say \"This was our previous discussion.\" If successful, DeepSeek will read your whole PDF and then summarize your previous discussion. You can now continue where you left off.\n\nMost other browsers should have a \"Save to PDF\" feature so you can do this. If not, get Bullzip PDF Printer or something. Nothing gets printed to your physical printer, it's just creating a PDF of the whole web page.\n\nHope that helps some ppl.",

Have the template generated, post your new summary template in the chat containing the content you want to continue in a new chat, have Deepseek or whatever AI you're using generate a summary using the template you provided, post that summary in your new chat. \n\nYou'd save a lot of tokens this way.

I'm using it. Right now. It's the best method that I know of so far if you really need to drill into details and to have DeepSeek keep the same \"conversational tone.\" Asking DeepSeek to use chat memory or just referencing a previous discussion superficially risks losing the tone, risks losing the details, etc.",

      "text": "\nThe argument that a college degree will guarantee the graduate decades of higher income is being quickly destroyed by the AI revolution. AIs are poised to replace knowledge work first, and that's the kind of work that going to college prepares one for.\n\nYoung people choose to go to college not just for the education. The importance of the social experience cannot be overestimated. So how do we build new colleges or transform existing ones into institutions that provide students this experience, but are much more affordable?\n\nMake them into giant 4-year entrepreneurial AI hubs. Make them into the kinds of environments where young students get together not just to learn the business of entrepreneurship from AIs, but to meet their future startup co-founders and begin building their new startups.\n\nThe dorms and meal plans would stay. The vast majority of professors would be shown the door. Entrepreneurial classes would be taught by AIs that are far more intelligent and knowledgeable about entrepreneurship than virtually all of today's human professors. And these AIs would work for pennies on the dollar!\n\nThe vast majority of administrators would also be gone. Many schools employ unreasonably high numbers of administrators. For example, Vanderbilt University employs more than one full-time administrator for every two undergraduate students. Since administration is also knowledge work, these vastly more intelligent and knowledgeable AIs that are being built today can easily perform those administrative roles, and probably much more effectively.\n\nSeveral decades ago, four years of college could be paid for with about 1/10th of what it costs today. For example, if four years of tuition that cost $20,000 in 1977 had risen only with standard inflation, the equivalent in 2025 dollars would be $97,000. But that tuition has grown to $328,000, an increase of over 1,500%. By transitioning to an almost exclusively AI-populated faculty and administration, college can again become as affordable as it once was.\n\nIn many instances these new colleges and universities will no longer be doing the teaching, as students would learn entrepreneurship independently from their own personal AI tutors or in study groups where they all learn from the same AI professor. Evidence is growing that personal tutors are a much more effective way to learn, so this change would be an added advantage. Many of these new schools could resemble 4-year summer camps where students work independently or in groups, and work as hard or not as they want, while having as much time as they want for socializing, networking, and collaborating with their student co-founders to build AI startups.\n\nYeah, I think the era of unreasonably expensive and overly demanding higher education is just about over. Of course this needs to be set in motion. Young people can do some of this by, for example, banding together, buying unused education campuses, and founding their own revolutionary new AI entrepreneurial institutions. This would be an ideal ambition for recent college graduates who can't find jobs, but could hopefully make a bundle from establishing these new colleges.\n\nThis revolutionary shift in higher education is absolutely inevitable, and probably coming in a few years rather than a few decades. I wish the students and their business partners who decide to establish these new institutions all the luck in the world in making college affordable again, and very probably a lot more effective and fun!",

I've done my own research on the Opium Wars, Taiping Rebellion, Meeker Massacre on the Ute, I've listened to Ghosts of Gold Mountain. When I have some extra cash there are other books that I want to invest in for research. YouTube videos on the Meeker Massacre and kind of delving into Native American boarding schools. That's where I learned about Kill the Indian. Save the man.\n\nFallout critiques on capitalism and by extension American imperialism. I wanted to use that platform to critique another time in history.\n\nThe weight of a thousand stares bore down on Jiang as he walked with Lenore through Silverton proper. He kept his spine straight and his shoulders squared, letting the hostility wash over him like water off an oilskin duster.\n\nHis tinted glasses no longer acted as the shield they once did. Before, white folks' ignorance was like armor; they’d squint, unsure, guessing Native or Mexican. Now, in a town filled with fear, the glasses made him look like someone hiding something. \n\nHe didn't like being marked, and neither did Len.\n\nFrom what he gathered from Mr. Chu and what Lenore gathered from Mrs. Chu, Carla wanted to raise her child, Ute, to pass down her heritage and culture.\n\nJiang considered Boone's wish to keep the child in Silverton to be beyond dishonorable. To tear a child away from its mother’s culture was like the Manchu forcing the queue on the Han, an act of submission masked as order, an erasure disguised as love. \n\nEven if Boone had good intentions, the outcome was a prison for the soul. The thought of that love, distorted into a tool of erasure, clenched his jaw. \n\nA memory came up, as sharp as a piece of porcelain. \n\nThe weight of Toopah’s hand on his shoulder, the muted command to hide the girls. Holding his breath in the dark, with their muffled whimpers in his ears, the earthy taste of dust and salt on his tongue. \n\nHe was the guardian because he was unseen. A Chinese boy in an Ahwahneechee home, the agent would ignore him and continue their search.\n\n\nOr Aa Ba’s low voice, recounting the Catholic missionaries in Guangdong. How church crosses were a prelude to foreign guns and the sweet, suffocating smell of opium.\n\nHe understood the urge to preserve. Everywhere, the fight was the same: to defend a way of life while the country was dismantling, bleaching, and labeling what it deemed savage or heathen.\n\nIt all added up. Sheriff Andy’s failure to investigate, even if he saw Carla as a daughter. In the ledger of this land, people like her, people like us, didn’t merit an entry. \n\nThey entered the sheriff's office. The room reeked of stale cigarettes; Deputy Beagle, Boone, Vargas, and Marshal Jackson were nowhere to be seen. Compared to yesterday’s crowd, the office seemed empty.\n\nSheriff Andy sat alone at his desk, studying a map with a cigarette between his fingers. The late-morning rays warmed his dark brown skin.\n\nHis finger traced a line on the map, brows furrowed in thought, unaware of anyone's presence until the hinges squeaked when Jiang closed the door behind them. \n\nJiang slouched his shoulders and stuffed his hands into his duster pockets. He needed to understand how the sheriff used authority. So he played into the quiet stereotype, keeping his tinted glasses on.\n\n“How’d the perimeter check go, Beagle?”\n\nThe grandfather clock struck eleven. At last, the sheriff's gaze lifted. Sheriff Andy’s gaze met Len's, then his. \n\n“I did not realize a man of my status could be a lawman,” Jiang said, a hint of humor in his voice. \n\nThe sheriff’s lip twitched in amusement as he took a long drag from his cigarette. He exhaled a slow curl of smoke toward the ceiling, then ground the butt out in the ashtray. “Neither did I. But here we are.”\n\nLenore hooked her thumbs in her belt loops. “As much as I enjoy small talk, sheriff—we got some questions ya might answer.”\n\nThe sheriff leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms. His focus remained on Jiang, whom he saw as the real threat. \n\nHe might be dangerous, but she was too, if given the chance. The sheriff viewed Len as a hotheaded, loudmouthed farmhand who didn't understand her place among adults.\n\n“Figured this wasn’t a social call,” Andy said, his gaze still fixed on Jiang. “What do you want to know?”\n\nHe stepped forward, shoulders relaxed, pretending to be compliant. The act was still ongoing, but less convincing now. A flicker of recognition flashed across the sheriff’s face, as if he’d just seen a ghost.\n\n“I see what you’re doing, Mr. Hsu,” he said, fingers drumming on his arm. “Colored man learns to make himself small. White folks in charge don’t like being questioned. The difference is, my authority’s always on trial—for being a negro.”\n\n“Don’t give me the ‘quiet John Chinaman’ routine in here,” Andy said, squaring his shoulders. “I see the bounty hunter behind the act.”\n\nJiang’s shoulders stayed slack as he shifted his weight. “But you are a man with power, a badge, and we are men without. My partner and I should respect your badge.”\n\nHis lips curled into a slight smile. “Can’t say you weren’t raised with manners.” Andy straightened his posture, his gaze lingering on Jiang, his expression saying, Keep your partner in line. He gave a single, slow nod, granting them the floor.\n\n“We are looking into the disappearance of Carla Boone, sheriff,” Jiang said, his voice level. “We were told you might have information.”\n\nLenore stepped forward, just half a pace, her thumbs still hooked in her belt loops. “We heard she was pregnant.”\n\nThe sheriff smoothed the map. His face softened as regret spread across it. His hands went still, resting flat on the paper. When he looked up, the tough lawman had returned.\n\n\"Who told you that?\" he asked, his voice soft.\n\n“Deputy Boone inquired that we look into his wife's disappearance,” Jiang spoke up.\n\nThe sheriff clasped his hands on the map. “So he's still looking,” he said, his voice going soft. “What do you want to know?”\n\nJiang glanced at Lenore, clasping his hands together at his waist. She replied with a tilt of her chin. \n\n“Sheriff, how close were you to Carla?” he asked.\n\nSheriff Andy leaned back in his chair, the old wood creaking. His professional mask slipped, revealing a moment of tiredness. The wrinkles on his face deepened into his skin, aging him further.\n\n“Close?” he said, his voice lower now. “I raised that boy. Promised his father I would, right before the man died in my arms at Petersburg. Boone was closed off for a long time. Hardened. Then he met Carla.” \n\nA faint, almost wistful smile touched his lips, gone as quickly as it came. “Was like watchin’ a damned flower bloom in a desert. She was tough, mind you. Didn’t suffer fools, and most of this town qualified. But with him? She was sunshine. He’d look at her, and for the first time since he was a child, he’d look peaceful.”\n\nHe picked up his cold coffee, stared into the mug, and set it down again without drinking. “Carla became family. My family. So you tell me how close I was.”\n\nShe shifted her weight, leaning toward Jiang. He didn't expect that kind of backstory: a surrogate father and his adopted son. \n\nUpdate: Thanks for the upvotes! I'm still editing this chapter. This is a rough draft. I was originally writing in the other co-protagonist Lenore's POV, but it felt wrong. So I changed it to Jiang's/James. Deepseek is helping me with sensitivity writing (I don't have money for a sensitivity reader), historical fact checker making sure what I've researched is handled with care and depth. ",
