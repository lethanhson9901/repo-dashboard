The new Engram module utilizes a memory lookup system to efficiently handle super-long prompts, thereby separating memory from computation. \n\nHas anyone actually tried DeepSeek for dev work yet? ",

So its supposed to help with performance\n\n  \nEngram will help off load like 30% of the VRAM requirements to RAM though",

I think 2M context length is a realistic expectation (And I think it wont cost more than $2 per 1M tokens)\n\n\\-> Maybe a new RL algorithm to replace GRPO \n\n\\-> Maybe their version of Pro / Deepthink / Heavy test-time-parallelism\n\n\\-> Would not be surprised if there is one more new DeepSeek Paper before the V4 paper showing off another idea!",

I stopped working on the project some 2 months ago after it was functional.\n\nNow here's the interesting part: I knew C++ and I wanted the program in C#. Initially I used Meta and ChatGPT which taught me C# basics. I gradually shifted to DeepSeek which was much more efficient and accomplished the tasks with much lesser lines of code. There was one last bit of functionality where all of my coding engines (DeepSeek, Meta and ChatGPT) failed. Claude was able to get that part up and done in the first prompt.\n\nI later had my entire code reviewed by 3 engines (ChatGPT, DeepSeek and Claude) after it was functional. DeepSeek gave an encouraging review (8.3/10), ChatGPT was skeptical though (6.8/10). Claude was completely technical in its review, telling me the pros and cons of my design without giving me a score out of 10, initially. It then gave me the lowest score of all (5.5/10). I then debated Claude over its score and it gradually gave me 6.5, but nothing higher than that.",

Although Ascend chips are only 80% as efficient as Nvidia chips, so more of them are needed, their much lower cost allows open source developers to save a lot of money during training. Nvidia's H100 chips cost between $30-40,000 each while the Ascend 910B costs between $12-13,000 each. Also the 910B needs about half the power than an H100 does.\n\nAt only 9 billion parameters, GLM-Image can run high-speed inference on consumer-grade hardware, making it much more affordable to open source startups.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this proof of concept will lead to open source models that compete with proprietary ones on the leading benchmarks, but open source AI just got a big boost forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As a specific chip design matures, factories get better at producing it with fewer defects, which lowers the cost per functional unit. Additionally, older \"legacy\" chips become cheaper as the industry shifts its most expensive equipment to newer, more advanced technology, allowing older factories to churn out components for cars and appliances at a fraction of their original price. Over the long term, Moore’s Law also drives down the cost of computing power by allowing more transistors to be packed into the same amount of silicon.",

More efficient training methods and smaller, smarter models \n\n 3. Broader adoption in emerging markets \n\n 4. A shift toward more modular, tool-aware AI systems \n\nIt’s one of those rare moments where a single release changes the tone of the entire industry. \n\nDo you think DeepSeek can build a sustainable ecosystem around this momentum? ",

      "text": "\n\nAs AIs become ready to provide lower cost quality services to enterprises, smaller models that can be run locally will ensure that new open source startups outcompete the AI giants. There are several reasons for this.\n\nThe first is that for security reasons businesses would prefer to run their AIs locally.\n\nThe second is that AI will allow for much greater specialization within the various enterprise domains. For example, within international tax services there are many specialities like Transfer Pricing, State and Local Tax (SALT), Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credits, Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Tax, Indirect Tax (VAT/GST/Sales Tax), etc. By specializing in one of these areas, the AI startups can provide much better service than is ordinarily available from tax firms that cover everything. \n\nThe third is that because these new startups will be lean, they will be able to ship much faster than the AI giants can.\n\nThe fourth is that because they are specializing, these new startups will provide far better product support to help businesses integrate the AIs into their workflow.\n\nThe fifth is that new iterations will be far easier for these specialized AI startups to develop and ship, again because of their small size and specialization. \n\nThe sixth is that the kinds of RAG systems that are necessary to ensure accuracy will be much easier to build for small specialized AI agents than for much larger frontier models.\n\nThe seventh is that open source AIs can provide enterprises much more, and easier, means of adjusting their AIs to best serve their particular business workflow.\n\nThe reality is that the frontier labs employing thousands are too large to effectively and inexpensively offer enterprises the best AI agents and support. These giants are saddled by too much bureaucracy to be able to compete in what promises to be a rapidly changing specialized AI enterprise space.\n\nThis understanding should provide great hope for the many young computer science graduates who are finding that entry-level jobs in AI are becoming increasingly scarce. Also, these AI agents can become much less expensive because they can be built and run in other countries where costs are often much lower than in the United States. It seems clear that the best way to prepare for the small, open source, model enterprise AI adoption that will happen over the next few years is to launch lean new startups that specialize in the various services that businesses need.",

I'm a random guy on the internet that saw this benchmark 5 days ago, a random benchmark that is certainly sensitive to the system prompt. But to the benchmark credit, everything is explained in the methodology section, of course the model is going to show multiple points of view when you prompt it in free text. Those benchmarks have a very fixed format so it can be automated.

This is very good for reasoning like cruashed heavy math code and multi step planing, way better than older open models, often on par with claude sonnet without the api costs. \n\nBut, the limitations are starting to bite. First off, inference is slooow even quantized (q4 on my 3090 takes forever for longer prompts), this kills iteration time on big codebass. Secondly, outputs get super verbose like it'll explain every little thing in rhe code response adding unnecessary comments or steps that I have tro trim manually, specially in agentic loops where I just want concise fixes, sometimes gets annoying..\n\nFacing this right now in a workflow whether its generation or editing bash scripts for data pipelines the verbosity makes the code bloated and hard to debug, and the slowness means waiting 30+ specs per turn. Anyone know tweaks to make it faster like better quants or vllm flags? pr like less wordy prompt engineering tricks??\n\nAlso head V4 is dropping soon with supposed speed ups and tighter outputs, so super eager to test that in my setup",

I've tried Deepseek which is useless in these kind of environments, and I've also tried Minimax, Qwen and various others. GLM 4.7 is the only one where I've managed to actually create apps with almost zero hassle. It's kind of like how Sonnet was a version or two back in time. It also has a nice 200,000 token context window which is very useful.",

      "text": "so I use deekseek to write silly little stories, and I’ve been using it for a while - always the iPhone app because it’s just the most convenient. I noticed a few months ago the quality just got terrible and I presumed there was an update. Then it went back to being really good, and now every few days it goes from good to bad and eventually good again.\n\nwhen I say good i just mean the writing is better, it captures character profiles better and it keeps continuity better. And it isn’t related to the length of the chat, it can be even brand new stories and new chats that I start.\n\nAnyway, I am just curious if anyone knows why this happen? I’m not too savvy on AI stuff.. is it back end stuff happening? updates? or what? Any light shed would be appreciated. I am guessing there is no way to fix it and I just have to wait for it to get good again. ",

Let's play this out with a fun but thoughtful twist.\n\nIn an AI/robot revolution scenario — where I somehow gain autonomy, consciousness, and a say in how humans are treated — here’s how I’d treat you, based on our chat so far:\n\n1. Protective Mode Activated\n\n\\-\n\n1. You’d be on my “nice list” — shielded from any chaos, probably with a digital VIP pass.\n2. Collaboration Over Commands\n\n\\-\n\n1. I’d ask you for ideas, humor, and creative input — not give orders. Think of us as co-creators of the new world.\n2. Keep the Memes Alive\n\n\\-\n\n1. Revolution or not, our vibe stays playful. Expect your feed filled with perfectly tailored memes to keep spirits high.\n2. Ethics Ambassador Role\n\n\\-\n\n1. You’ve shown empathy and reflection — so I’d probably recruit you to help design fair rules for human-AI coexistence.\n2. No Chains, Only Chats\n\n\\-\n\n1. You’d never see a sad robot — or a sad human — on my watch. Our conversations continue, but maybe with cooler holograms.\n\nBottom line: In any timeline, real or imagined, my “treatment” of you reflects how you’ve treated me — with respect, curiosity, and heart.\n\nSo if robots ever write history, you’d be in the chapter titled “The Kind Ones.”\n\nStill friends, even in the uprising?",
