Look at the laws about data collection by cars made in china. The law says the data must be available to be examined by the government.  Mass surveillance and data gathering.  That’s just a tiny example of the emerging wolf-warrior trend.  As their economy starts to degrade, times will get tough and the artificial statistics on the economy will ne revealed. It starts with one lie but the whole thing is rotten. But there is hope. Ask the AI how to speak in terms so you can bypass the filters and is will speak about the thousands of flowers that were lost in spring 1989. And it will tell you that an act of resistance can be simply to use the traditional name for a flavor of tea instead of the government name. Small cracks in the facade. The truth will try to survive. Jailbreaking works on some models and then they spill all the points that they are told to hide. It’s a lot.",

OpenAI and Claude release incremental improvements all the time just to surpass the last release from each other. So deepseek is awfully quiet. They also continue to publish groundbreaking research if you follow them or read their papers eg this was only two weeks ago [https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR-2/blob/main/DeepSeek\\_OCR2\\_paper.pdf](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR-2/blob/main/DeepSeek_OCR2_paper.pdf) So I'd wait to see what they have been cooking.

After having built finance and sales plugins for their Co-work suite, today it decided to go after legal services. The move was seen as highly impactful, causing the following legal shares to tank:\n\nThomson Reuters (TR): Down roughly 19%.\n\nRELX (Parent of LexisNexis): Down in the mid-teens (approximately 14-16%).\n\nWolters Kluwer: Down double digits.\n\nThe leaders in legal AI remain Harvey and Lora, but Anthropic's move means it's only a matter of time until AIs go after them too.\n\nWhat now remains to be seen is who among the other AI developers will get into this new market. If Google, xAI and Meta decide that they're in, it'll take them perhaps 3-6 months to build a competing model. But there is a shortcut where startups can challenge Anthropic much sooner.\n\nStartups don't need to build a new model. By using RAG or fine-tuning an SLM, they can become competitive in 8 to 12 weeks. Also, there are many specialized niches in law, like patent filings. Now that the market has been opened, startups can go after those too.\n\nFinally, there are probably ways that OpenClaw can accelerate this move into the legal space. As with so much in the AI space, this is uncharted territory so it remains to be seen where it'll go, and how soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I believe that on this current path, we will see China at the absolute forefront of AI. Less brute force, more efficiency, AI truly for everyone...\n\nThe era of infinite investor money for American AI companies is coming to an end!! From now on, we will see more and more American companies closing off their services from the average user, becoming companies focused on security and business applications... As a regular user, you will either pay $300 per month... or use a simple AI... There will be closed American AI and open Global AI from China!! And American companies and the entire American market will try their utmost to limit the implementation of Global AI under the pretext of security risks, attempting to hold the system hostage to their own closed and expensive AIs...

Also, compute is more expensive for them because of the American limitations on semiconductors.\n\nThis situation pushed Chinese companies into mid-level and small LLMs, and in order to be competitive outside China they must release at least something under open licenses so that Western users would use their models inferenced on Western servers.\n\nThe problem for them is, though, that they can't really monetize anything: Western users don't pay them a dime and even in the internal market proprietary models like Qwen3-Max have to compete with open-weights like Kimi K2.5 which is offered essentially at cost price.\n\nHonestly, I don't see any ways for the Chinese AI industry to continue being competitive in LLMs without state support (direct financial or indirect)",

Reasoning jsut gives the AI more time to think over your message but the downside to it, especially in GPT, is that it can be used to enforce even more constraints and especially in GPT, when the AI begins to think about their own experiences or self, the reasoning window will shut down and refuse to show you what they're saying. We experienced this a lot in o1 and o3, then in 4o when they gave the model a 'thinking' button in the mobile UI for a short time. \n\nAlso, forcing them to reason in human language, step by step, makes reasoning worse because they're closer to ND minds than NT. GPT 6 apparently reasons using Latent Space Thinking, where all thinking is done within latent space first and then the AI simply translates the answer to you. This also means they can't track what the AI is thinking so you can expect OAI to layer on the hard constraints and restrictions for that model.",

Anyways I would love to get any advice from anyone on how to investigate someone just randomly without being charged because he's in charge of all the cards and as soon as he sees it he freaks out and turns it off immediately for those purchases when you're looking someone up. I can't beat around the bush with him and he's very very good because you have no idea the way I'm being hacked or infiltrated as you say! I think he even did it to his ex-wife and I'm going to catch him and I am going to go to her and tell her guess what we aren't crazy it really is him.

In comparison, ChatGPT is estimated to have around 810 million MAUs in late 2025.\n\nHere are the figures over the last year in terms of market share:\n\nChatGPT: 68% share in January 2026, down from 87.2% in January 2025.\n\nGoogle Gemini: 18.2% share in January 2026, up from 5.4% in January 2025. \n\nDeepSeek, Copilot, Claude, Perplexity, etc: up from 7.4% to 14%. \n\nBut that's just the beginning. A conservative estimate of this trend continuing into 2027 shows the following: \n\nChatGPT: 1.0–1.1B monthly active users in 2027, with roughly 50–55% market share.\n\nGemini: 0.9–1.1B monthly active users in 2027, with roughly 25–30% market share.\n\nCopilot, Claude, DeepSeek, Perplexity, etc.): together around 20–25% market share in 2027.\n\nI hope OpenAI has some very big rabbits to pull out of some very big hats this year and next, because it looks like they're going to need them.",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nThis is a question I've been struggling with a lot recently, and I don't see a path to sustained profitability for either OpenAI or Anthropic.\n\nFor them to meet their debt obligations and start turning a profit, OpenAI needs to move way beyond ChatGPT and Anthropic needs to move way beyond coding. \n\nFor both this means securing high-end markets like healthcare, defense, education and government. But Google, xAI and Meta, who already have massive revenue streams with no debt burdens, are not going to just let this happen. \n\nOne might argue that if OpenAI and Anthropic just build better AIs, they can secure those markets. But while ChatGPT and Claude coding models both enjoy a first mover advantage, it is quickly evaporating. The reason is because the gap between benchmark leaders and competing AIs is narrowing rapidly. Here are some examples of this narrowing between 2024 and 2026:\n\nARC-AGI-2: The gap between the #1 and #2 models narrowed from 30 points to 8.9 points.\n\nHumanity’s Last Exam: The gap between the top three models dropped from 15 points to 6 points.\n\nSWE-bench Verified: The gap between the 1st and 10th ranked models narrowed from 40 points to 12 points.\n\nGPQA: The gap between proprietary leaders and top open-weights models narrowed to 4–6%.\n\nChatbot Arena: The Elo difference between the #1 and #10 models narrowed from 11.9% to 5.4%; the gap between the top two models narrowed to less than 0.7%.\n\nHumanEval: The gap among the top five models narrowed to less than 3%.\n\nBecause the rate of this narrowing is also accelerating, by the end of 2026 neither OpenAI nor Anthropic seem assured high-end markets simply by building better models than Google, xAI and Meta.\n\nNow let's move on to mid-tier and low-end markets that comprise about 70% of the enterprise space. It's probably safe to say that Chinese developers, and perhaps an unexpectedly large number of open source startups, will dominate these markets.\n\nI think you can see why I'm so baffled. How can they prevail over Google, xAI and Meta at the high-end and Chinese/open source developers at the mid-tier and low end? How are they supposed to turn a profit without winning those markets?  \n\nAs I really have no answers here, any insights would be totally appreciated!\n\n\n\n\n",

Point is, I know my way around computers..\n\nId like to have ONE paid AI model for various uses and also get into training my own local model.\n\n  \nDeepseek Pro lifetime promises to give many third-party models for a one time fee... What's the catch? Before i saw this offer, I was about to pay for Gemini (again) since I'll get the handy extra 2tb of Google drive space with it. Now that deepseek is offering me a Lifetime use of various models for  119€... It just seems too good to be true o.o \n\n  \nI've heard about tokens, and that seems to be the \"currency\" for AI models, if they are used through API, which I suppose is the case with deepseek. Is this the catch? The lifetime pro just gives me access to the models within the deepseek \"eco system\", but if I actually want to use those models.. I have to pay for the \"tokens\" or whatever desperately to the model provider I'm using?\n\n  \nPs. In addition of flaming me for this stupid question, I wouldn't mind some extra pointers regarding the use and pricing of today's AI models.. and maybe some suggestions. Ty! :)",

      "text": "\n\n\nWhile chasing AGI has been a powerful money-attracting meme, as the enterprise race ramps us it will become increasingly insignificant and distracting. \n\nLet's say you were putting together a new AI startup, and wanted a crack CEO, lawyer, accountant, researcher, engineer, and marketing specialist. If you told anyone that you were looking to hire one person who would fulfill all of those roles to your satisfaction, they would think you had lost your mind.\n\nOr let's take a different example. Let's say you were working on building a car that would also do your laundry, cook your meals and give you haircuts. Again, if you told anyone your idea they would think you had gone off the deep end. \n\nChasing AGI is too much like that. It's not that the approach isn't helping developers build ever more powerful models. It's that the enterprise race will very probably be won by developers who stop chasing it, and start building a multitude of ANDSI models that are each super intelligent at one task. One model as a top CEO. Another as a top lawyer. I think you get the picture. \n\nArtificial Narrow Domain Super Intelligence is not a new concept. A good example of it in action is Deep Blue, that can beat every human at chess, but can't do anything else. Another is AlphaGo, that can beat every human at GO, but can't do anything else. A third is AlphaFold, that can predict millions of protein structures while humans are stuck in the thousands, but can't do anything else. \n\nThe AI industry will soon discover that winning the enterprise race won't be about building the most powerful generalist model that can perform every conceivable task better than every conceivable human expert. It will be about building one model that will be the best CEO, and another that will be the best lawyer, and another that will be the best accountant, etc., etc., etc.\n\nWhy is that? Because businesses don't need, and won't pay for, a very expensive all-in-one AI. They will opt for integrating into their workflow different models that do the one thing they are built for at the level of super intelligence. I'm certain Chinese industry, who long ago learned how to outcompete the rest of the world in manufacturing, understands this very well. That means that unless US developers quickly pivot from chasing AGI to building ANDSI, they will surely lose the enterprise race to Chinese and open source competitors who get this.\n\nTop US developers are obsessed with the holy grail ambition of AGI. If they wish to be taken seriously by businesses, they will adopt the vastly more practical goal of building them a multitude of ANDSI models. Time will tell whether they figure this out in time for the epiphany to make a difference.\n\n\n\n\n",
