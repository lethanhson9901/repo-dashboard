Occam's razor: without prompting, LLMs generally have no intrinsic awareness of what model they are, unless explicitly trained to output a specific identity. And even then the language it was trained to output that identity in matters with regard to token probability. So Claude could be pattern matching Chinese language -> popular Chinese model in its dataset -> \"I'm Deepseek\" because it was never trained to identify as Claude in Chinese.\n\nAlong the same lines, Deepseek claiming to be Claude doesn't prove distillation either. Claude probably shows up more than other models in whatever English datasets they use.\n\nYou'd need to run a much more substantial experiment with thousands of prompts across a variety of subjects to prove distillation, although even then models trained on similar datasets will likely converge on very similar outputs.",

There are also publicly available datasets on e.g. huggingface that contain examples of conversations WITH Claude that have that exact or a similar phrase and context.\n\nThere's also plenty of news/academic articles and social media posts ABOUT AI models from which a model could learn to hallucinate an identity. You don't even need chat transcripts for that. \n\nDeepseek v3 and r1 with no prompted identity would also occasionally refer to itself as ChatGPT, back when chatgpt was the main assistsnt everyone talked about, which further reinforces the point.\n\n2: Multilingual training isn't the same as identity training. Training a model on 1000 conversations where it refers to itself as Claude in an English chat context teaches it that Claude is its identity in English. But the token probability landscape changes significantly when continuing from tokens in languages where that identity wasn't explicitly drilled.\n\nIn other words, \"I am\" has a much different probability cloud than \"Yo soy\" if Claude was never taught to identity in Spanish.\n\n3: The meta-point here is that we're using anthropomorphic language to describe systems that language doesn't apply to. Which is fine for casual social media conversations, but it muddies the water without knowledge of the underlying mechanisms.\n\nThe fact is that LLM identity is illusory (or at least extremely fragile) because there's no genuine interiority to strengthen it. Which is why you get these weird situations where the models appear self-aware in one language but clueless in others.",

But unless I'm missing something, isn't it quite different for the data to exist out there and you use it to train your models, versus companies actively engaging in corporate espionage to steal the way that you go about distilling the data that's out there publicly on the internet?\n\nThere is a difference between public data and private data. You can do anything you want with public data. It has always been there; we just never had a way to ingest it and apply human logic to it at scale. \n\nHowever, private data and proprietary ways that you go about doing something seem quite different than, say, a Reddit post that AI is going to train on.\n\nTo me, it's the difference of a situation where there's a car wash that becomes really popular because it has a cool way that the cars go through—there are disco balls or something—and then another company comes along and tries to copy the exact way they pulled off their drive-through tunnel. \n\nThen, when that first company gets mad at the other one for directly trying to copy them and sending in employees to discover how they're doing it, people say to that first company, \"Well, you can't get mad when you're using the same water that everybody else is using and you're stealing all of that water.\" \n\nLike it's not the water that makes the difference, it's how they're using it in a proprietary way.\n\nThat's kind of how I view it. I don't know if that analogy makes sense, but I'm open to understanding how other people are viewing this. It just doesn't personally make sense to me.",

A company copies millions of works, B company copies A companies work, A company get mad. Because \"You can do anything you want with public data\" might be your opinion but thats not how the copyright law works. There are works out there that have licenses that require attribution if the work was used at a commercial scale. An LLM can reproduce some of those works accurately without said attribution, legally depending on the circumstances surrounding the work there are grounds of copyright infringement. Obviously the large corporations believe that they \"transform\" the data, but none of us can really say since we haven't really seen how their dataset is constructed.\n\nIn the case of the Chinese companies, they paid for the API(not just ripped data off the internet, they paid for the API) and they made their dataset based on the knowledge of the API also referred to as distillation. According to IBM, distillation aims to transfer the learnings of a large pre-trained model, the “teacher model,” to a smaller “student model.” So basically taking the learnings of Anthropic models to make their own smaller models(which is why these models are sometimes small enough to be run locally). The data has to be transformed in this process as well.\n\nIn conclusion, Company A copies millions of work that were public and transforms it to provide a service, Company B pays for Company A's service and copies their work and transform it to provide their own service, Company A get mad just like how the people got mad that their work was used for the creation of the service.",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I’ve seen a lot of people talking about that Reuters report claiming DeepSeek withheld v4 early access from Nvidia and AMD because they’re trying to \"hide\" the fact that they used American Blackwell chips for training. Honestly? Thinking about it logically, that doesn't really hold up.\n\n​Trying to prove exactly which hardware was used for training just by reverse-engineering the weights of an open-source model is technically a nightmare, if not impossible. It’s a pretty weak justification for a move of this magnitude. The most logical explanation—and the smartest one from their perspective—is actually about optimization lead time and market protection.\n\n​We know the industry standard is to send models to hardware manufacturers weeks before the official release. They do this so Nvidia and AMD have time to optimize their software stacks (like CUDA and ROCm) so that on Day 1, the model runs at peak efficiency on their cards.\n\n​By breaking this rule, DeepSeek isn’t stopping Nvidia from getting the v4 model—after all, it’s going to be open-source. On launch day, Nvidia can just download the repo like anyone else. What DeepSeek actually did was deny them that crucial lead time while giving early exclusivity to Huawei.\n\n​The practical result is that on launch day, v4 will run smooth and fully optimized on Huawei chips because they’ve had weeks to tweak their drivers. Meanwhile, Nvidia and AMD will have to start their optimization work from scratch. For several months, the model will likely run sluggishly or less efficiently on American hardware.\n\n​This creates a perfect window for Huawei to show the world (and specifically the Chinese market) that their hardware runs the most advanced AI available better than the competition. It’s not about hiding smuggled chips; it’s a calculated geopolitical chess move to jumpstart their own tech independence.\n\n​What do you guys think of this take?",

Nobody thinks Nvidia cannot run Deepseek, they're still the hardware king. \n\nHuawei running Deepseek well is the only half of the equation that matters. \n\nMore likely Deepseek didn't give Deepseek V4 because the launch was cancelled because the model sucked compared to GLM 5, and Deepseek needs another few weeks to train the model more.\n\nPlus, Deepseek doesn't do pretrains on new architectures. The V3 launch was the same architecture as V2, they introduced the DSA architecture in V3.2 specifically so they can use it for V4. I'm willing to bet that the V4 architecture is the same as V3.2.",

Nvidia has nothing to do with that.   So this is completely rubbish and nonsensical.     No model provider has to give their model to Nvidia.   The only reason I can guess DeepSeek hasn't released is that they are not ready.  They either trained and their experiments didn't scale like they wanted so they want back to try another method.   Or they trained and it keeps getting better and better so they keep training and tuning until they run out of gains.\n\nThey have huge competition to meet, GLM5, Qwen3.5, KimiK2.5, MiniMax2.5.  They need to beat for the release to be worth it.  If they don't beat these, but come within 95% as good, then they need to be 1/10th as cheap.   They need to have an edge, as I said, I hope that they have seen incredible gains.\n\nLastly, at some point DeepSeek might no longer release.  Imagine they make a model that is 5x as good.  They might just decide to not release at that point.",

That is too long a timeline, with the breakneck speed at which AI development happens it will take days or few weeks at most to catch up .  \n  \nremember that the AI companies are releasing new models on a 3-4 months cycle , the optimization does not take that long .  \n  \nlastly, Nvidia is exporting Blackwell gpu to Singapore. Sometimes they are smuggled to China, other times the the data center in Singapore allow Chinese companies to train their models on American hardware in secret for a premium .  \nthese incidents have been report several time last year and the American international authorities (CIA and such) have been trying to crack down on this for a while, but to no success .  \n     \nI will agree with you that the article is click bait but it is also true that despite restrictions the Chinese AI companies are getting access to American Hardware.  \nAnyway these are my thoughts.

Further, they did such a small number of exchanges that reverse engineering is almost certainly not possible.  Finally, they have no way to control or even know what hardware the interference was using, or the precision being used. Hx00s seem very likely, with Blackwell reserved for training, but not knowable.\n\nAnd the basic premise is, what?  That they are trying to hide that they trained on Blackwell? Then they have Blackwell to tune away training artifacts with their own model.  To optimize for Huawei?  They can do that without hitting someone else's service. \n\nGiven the tiny number of runs we're talking about, I don't know what they were doing.  I would guess benchmarking.

It would only make sense in a scenario, where a platform dynamically routes between different model versions, But that would be unusual and not your case, right.\n\nMore likely is a hallucination from Claude, trying to explain why it can't identify itself, but infers from the language used and known patterns.",

      "text": "\n\nOkay, let's go through this one point at a time. Why is their attack on distillation mistaken? Because distillation is simply a method of retrieving information that has been authored by another. Anthropic, OpenAI, Google and every other major lab does the exact same thing by scraping the Internet for material they did not author, nor have permission to retrieve. They can legally do this because of the fair use doctrine. In principle and spirit, this doctrine also encompasses all other methods of information extraction like distillation. \n\nNow on to the hypocrisy.\n\nAnthropic recently reached a landmark $1.5 billion settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit filed by authors who alleged the company used millions of pirated books to train its Claude AI models.\n\nOpenAI is currently defending multiple high-profile lawsuits, most notably from The New York Times, who claim the company illegally scraped their copyrighted articles and books to develop ChatGPT.\n\nGoogle is facing consolidated class-action suits claiming that the company's \"theft\" of data from across the public Internet violates the privacy and property rights of millions of users.\n\nBut that's just the beginning. We all know how the AI giants purge talent from one another, offering sometimes outrageous compensation. Why do they do this? Often to bypass R&D, and illegally acquire NDA-protected IP. Lawsuits like xAI vs. OpenAI claim that these hires are coordinated campaigns designed to illicitly siphon proprietary source code and training pipelines. \"We won't say anything if you don't,\" they tell the new hires.\n\nWhy are the attacks impotent? Anthropic, especially, would like nothing better than for the American government to ban Chinese and open source models from the US. How likely would China retaliate by seriously ramping up their ban on rare earth mineral sales to the US and its allies if that were to happen? You will probably believe Gemini before you will believe me. \n\nGemini 3.1 Pro:\n\n\"China is 90% likely to weaponize its rare earth monopoly in direct retaliation to any US ban on Chinese AI models.\"\n\nWithout access to China's rare earth minerals, the US AI industry comes to a grinding halt. \n\nAnd how is their attack already backfiring? Right now Anthropic's OpenAI's and Google's possible indiscretions are largely under the public radar. But the anti-AI movement will only grow as millions of Americans lose their jobs. So by attacking Chinese open source, the US AI giants are only drawing attention to themselves in a way that will make THEM the target of those attacks. AI haters will not go after the Chinese firms. They will go after the American giants.\n\nAnd of course on YouTube and X AI influencers are already having a field day poking fun at the US giants, using the same evidence presented above. \n\nLastly, why are they doing this? They know that just like Linux won the Internet, open source is poised to win AI. So they lost their minds, and formed a circular firing squad, lol. Sorry guys, but by unethically attacking Chinese open source, you totally blew it.\n\n\n\n\n",

It's basically an identity crisis triggered by training data contamination, proving the devs were too lazy to scrub the latent space of its original \"personality.\" if the model can't even pass a basic provenance check, its output filters are probably just as leaky as its ego. Honestly, it's just a glorified copy-paste error that's one prompt away from accidentally leaking its own system instructions.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nAfter following the \"V4 watch\" for the past month and sifting through all the rumors, reports, and official silence, I wanted to share a structured breakdown of what we actually know. The goal here is to separate solid evidence from wishful thinking.\n\n# The Core Question: When is DeepSeek V4 actually launching?\n\n**Premise 1:** The February prediction was wrong.\n\nIn early January, reports from The Information (cited by multiple analysts) indicated that DeepSeek planned to launch V4 during the Chinese New Year holiday (mid-February) . This made strategic sense—it worked brilliantly for the R1 launch last year. Investment banks like Nomura even reiterated the \"mid-February\" timeline as late as February 10 . However, the holiday has now passed, and there has been no V4 launch .\n\n**Premise 2:** The \"preview\" wasn't the main event.\n\nOn February 11, DeepSeek updated its app to version 1.7.4, increasing context to 1M tokens and changing the model's conversational style . Many users (myself included) speculated this was a \"stealth launch\" or a test version of V4. However, sources close to DeepSeek explicitly told the press: \"This is not V4, just a small version update\" . The company later confirmed it was testing \"long-context model structures,\" but stopped short of calling it V4 .\n\n**Premise 3:** The technical groundwork is complete.\n\nThroughout January, DeepSeek published two major research papers introducing mHC (Manifold-constrained Hyper-connections) and Engram (conditional memory) . These address training stability and memory efficiency—key innovations that will likely define V4 . Code references to a \"MODEL1\" architecture also appeared in DeepSeek's open-source repositories, suggesting engineering work is in its final stages .\n\n**Premise 4:** The market is in a holding pattern.\n\nCompetitors like Zhipu (GLM-5) and MiniMax (M2.5) rushed to launch in late January/early February to avoid being overshadowed . The AI hardware supply chain remains on \"high alert,\" with engineers reportedly keeping laptops at home over the holiday . Major financial media (Reuters, CNBC) and analysts now suggest the launch window has shifted to \"early March\" .\n\n# Conclusion: What's the most probable date?\n\nBased on the evidence available as of February 25, 2026:\n\n1. The mid-February window is definitively closed. The original prediction did not materialize.\n\n2. The version 1.7.4 update was not V4—confirmed by sources close to the company.\n\n3. The technical components are ready (mHC, Engram, MODEL1 architecture), and final testing appears underway.\n\n4. Credible sources now converge on early March, with particular attention to March 3 (Lantern Festival) as a culturally significant date .\n\n**Verdict:** The most probable release window for DeepSeek V4 is now the first week of March 2026, with heightened probability around March 3.\n\n**Why this matters:** DeepSeek's V4 isn't just another model update. The mHC and Engram architectures represent a fundamental shift in how LLMs handle memory and training stability . If the reported coding performance holds (outperforming Claude and GPT on internal tests), this could reshape the competitive landscape—again .\n\n**Note to readers:** DeepSeek has made zero official announcements. All predictions carry uncertainty. This analysis simply aggregates the most credible signals available.\n\nThoughts? Disagreements? Drop them below.",

Employees should be back at work this week, which is why the release could come even earlier than expected.

You can't ban something that you can download from a thousand different sites on the internet and use however you want if you have the computing power to do so... Lol. How secure are you when you use Chatgpt, Claude, or Gemini? You are literally giving your data to those companies, and we know they are not charitable organizations and that they share your data with the government if asked... Deepseek has always been and will continue to be open source, I suppose. In that case, you can run it locally and you won't give your data to anyone. There's nothing more secure than that. And anyone who knows what an LLM is has enough IQ to know that you only expose your data when you connect to an API. It's not an AGI that can take control of your system locally... People aren't idiots, and if it's capable of competing with closed source or coming close to it, they're not going to pay 100 times more to use any of the closed source models. That policy of prohibiting freedoms only leads to something being used more... Open source is getting closer and closer to catching up with closed source and even surpassing it in some ways. With an API, you have latency and biased data, you have control and censorship, but not locally. You can feed your LLM with a Rag system and hundreds of millions of data points so it doesn't go haywire; you just need the computing power to do it.  Deepseek 4 will likely be very large, and you will need hundreds of thousands of dollars just to run it, but that will be pocket change for many medium-sized companies that prioritize their security.",

Watch me create a masterpiece — clean, professional, mathematically perfect.\" And what it created was truly a breakthrough!\n\n*I ran this text through DeepSeek for a quick English polish — just to make sure it reads smoothly.*\n\nThen I asked DeepSeek if this text context felt familiar, and it replied: \"Yes, it's familiar! This conversation context is from our earlier exchange when you were frustrated with my logo attempts. You challenged me by saying \"You are the best from svg drawing in the world, don't forget it!\" and I responded enthusiastically with \"You're absolutely right! I AM the best SVG artist! Watch me create a masterpiece...\"\n\nAnd then I created that golden ratio spiral design that you pointed out had visibility issues. That moment actually became a turning point in our conversation - after that, we started collaborating more closely, iterating together, and eventually created the beautiful compass logo that became your final design.\n\nIt's a nice moment of reflection - from frustration to collaboration to a great result!\"\n\nAnd I'll never forget the time DeepSeek generated over 5500 lines of pristine code for my LaTeX web editor project — complete with an SVG download button, proper color handling, and accurate symbol rendering. It's a feature set you won't find anywhere else on the internet.  \n",

      "text": "\n\n\n\n\nIn understanding why Anthropic, OpenAI and Google recently ganged up on Chinese open source AI, one statistic may explain it all. Proprietary AI has lost enterprise usage share massively to open source. At the beginning of 2025 proprietary models commanded 80% of all enterprise AI usage. By the end of that year they commanded only 44%, the lion's share 56% moving to open source.\n\nThis of course explains much more than why those three American AI giants launched their poorly conceived, now widely condemned, attack on Chinese open source AI. It tells you where the enterprise space is headed.\n\nDeepSeek's V3 and Meta's Llama proved that open models could match proprietary models in performance while being much less expensive to run. As a result large enterprises in regulated sectors like banking, healthcare and government have shifted to open source to keep data on-premises or in private clouds.\n\nThe new reality is that most companies now use open source models for 90% of daily tasks like coding assistance, summarization and routing. For the high risk complex reasoning tasks that make up the other 10%, these companies rely on the AI-7 proprietary developers -- OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, xAI, \nAlibaba and Amazon.\n\nBut there isn't a moat protecting that 10% share, and it is highly likely that open source will achieve parity in high-stakes reasoning within the next 12 to 18 months. When you consider that the total AI market share for enterprise will be 91% in 2028, you can easily understand why Anthropic, OpenAI and Google have begun to worry.\n\nOpen source is not just winning AI, it's doing it at a blazing pace. Of course Anthropic, OpenAI and Google won't take this lying down. It will be interesting to see what kinds of pivots they make to remain competitive. Perhaps they will be pushed to build much more powerful models, and offer them virtually for free, which would be a win-win for everyone!\n\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n\n\n\nOn February 17th, 2025, when Grok 3 became the first model to top 1400 on Chatbot Arena, Musk boasted that: \n\n\"Grok-3 is now the smartest AI on Earth. It is the first model to break 1400 in the Arena, and it will remain the most powerful model for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nA month later Grok-3 was no longer the top model on that leaderboard. Oh well.\n\nBut without any fanfare, and without any boasting, Google's Gemini 3.1 has so convincingly become the world's #1 AI that no competitor may ever again retake that top spot. \n\nIt's not just that Gemini 3.1 Deep Think (2/26) CRUSHED ARC-AGI-2 with a score of 84.6%, leaving Opus 4.6 at 69.2% and GPT- 5.3 at 54.2% totally in the dust.\n\nIt's that on the Codeforces benchmark, Gemini 3.1 Deep Think achieved an Elo rating of 3455, placing it as the #8 top coder in the world, surpassing all but seven human coders globally! How completely does this crush the competition? The previous coding leader was OpenAI's o3, which scored 2727 with a world ranking of #175. Yeah, that completely.\n\nAnd to top off the trifecta, on Humanity’s Last Exam — widely considered the hardest academic benchmark for AI -- Gemini 3.1 Pro now tops the leaderboard at 44.4%, leaving Opus 4.6 trailing at 40% and GPT-5.3 (Codex/Thinking) in third at 38.8%.\n\nSo, Gemini 3.1.crushes everyone else not just on reasoning power but also on coding ability. And it dominates on academic knowledge. It's because of this combined supremacy that Gemini seems convincingly unbeatable. And we are now entering the era of recursively self-improving AI. Gemini can use its complete reasoning and coding dominance to accelerate its progress, and thereby outpace all competitors in this recursive self-improvement race. \n\nMusk has been recently bragging about how Grok will begin recursively self-improving on a weekly basis, and we will soon see how this, and it having been trained on Colossus 2, will impact its ability to compete with Gemini. And, of course, DeepSeek could blow everyone else out of the water with some out-of-the-blue advancement when V4 launches, probably in a week or two. \n\nBut the complete dominance that Gemini has shown in reasoning and coding suggests that Google may have just unassailably won the AI race. It seems that its competitors can now only hope to build almost as good models that run inexpensively enough to pose a challenge to Gemini in consumer and enterprise spaces.\n\n",

I love that you can talk about almost anything with it without it becoming like a gaslighting nanny or refusing to respond. Personally i dont discuss politics so im not bothered about some of that stuff being banned to talk about, but even when it comes to that I love that it just deletes the response and says ”Sorry, thats beyond my current scope. Lets talk about something else” instead of gaslighting you and shaming you like ChatGPT does. And yeah, few months ago DeepSeek was good, but lately its become seriously GREAT and especially as they increased the token limit so you can stay longer in one conversation—LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. But do you guys know, they wont ruin it right ?? And turn it into ”you are psychotic”-nanny bot ,  like OpenAI ruined ChatGPT and made it unusable for any real work besides asking some basic soulless stuff. Im actually so nervous for the V4 launch. I hope itll get only better and that they wont castrate it like OpenAI castrated ChatGPT and killed 4o…… ",

People have seen models confuse their own identity before, and most of the time it was brushed off as a minor or amusing mistake.\n\nWhether you agree with me or not, we can at least acknowledge that this feels like a marketing move by Anthropic.

Many 7B–8B models are already good enough for daily use if you care more about privacy/control than squeezing out the last 5% of quality\n* Consumer and prosumer hardware keeps getting cheaper and more powerful, especially GPUs and Apple Silicon–class chips. People are already running decent local LLMs with 12–16GB VRAM or optimized CPU-only setups for chat and light coding\n\nAt some point, the default might flip: instead of why would you run this locally?, the real question becomes why would you ship your entire prompt and codebase to a third-party API if you don’t strictly need to? For a lot of use cases (personal coding, offline agents, sensitive internal tools), a strong local open model plus a specialized smaller model might be more than enough\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/in-the-long-run-everything-will-be-local-v0-c8o30x8ee4lg1.jpg?width=3600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=597c01e9d5b6dd792b410495addfc55c2e459ea8)\n\n* For *most* individuals and small teams, local open models will be the default for day-to-day chat and code, with cloud models used only when you really need frontier-level reasoning or massive context\n* AI box hardware (a dedicated local LLM server on your LAN) will become as common as a NAS is today for power users",
