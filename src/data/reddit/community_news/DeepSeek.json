They just don’t give a shit about dialing in the perfect consumer chatbot , or adding consumer features, or acquiring more daily active users. \n\nThey care about making breakthroughs, that’s it.

Each model (R1, V3.1, V3.2) only costs ~$200k in GPU costs since it’s using the same base model.\n\nV4 will be an entirely new posttraining run to create a new base model. DeepSeek is a very traditionally nerdy company, and the naming scheme is run by the nerds, not the marketing department. That means V4 will have to EARN the +1.0 name, which means it will be a full pretraining run from scratch.\n\nThe model will probably be around Gemini 3 Flash in size, so probably around 1.2T/15B. I don’t see them going smaller à la GLM, and the denser the model the more expensive it is to train, so I suspect they will make it more sparse than V3. Around 1.2T/15B is a safe bet. If they’re going for the intelligence crown, then they might make it ~50B active, but that’ll be a lot more expensive to train. \n\nThey might train it to combine Instruct and Thinking, they might not. Either way that’s a cheap $200k posttrain run so they might do both, the same way V3/R1 was separate and V3.1 combined them. \n\nThere’s a 90% chance they’ll use DSA, and a 10% chance they’ll introduce a more exotic attention format. No chance of regression; they won’t switch back to MLA, the same way they didn’t switch back to GQA after they introduced MLA. \n\nContext size should be 1M or more, otherwise what’s the point of introducing DSA anyways? I will eat a hat if context size is smaller than 1M tokens.",

This is for Google Chrome (but you should really get [Thorium](https://thorium.rocks/) if you want Chrome + ad blocking built in, only other difference between real Chrome and Thorium is Thorium's icon is blue)\n\n1. Open DeepSeek to your chat where the length limit was reached.\n\n2. In the top-right corner of your web browser, click the Menu (three horizontal bars). Go to \"Print\".\n\n3. In the Print Dialog, make sure \"Destination\" is set to \"Save as PDF\" (this should be the default anyways). Wait for the preview to generate. It should be around 200 pages for a whole chat that has hit the length limit.\n\n4. Click the \"Save\" button to save the whole conversation to PDF. This should result in a PDF around 5mb, for a 200-page chat. 5mb is very small, more than within DeepSeek's limits for a new chat. It also beats having to manually copy and paste into Notepad (way too tedious for 200 pages), or asking DeepSeek to summarize and lose context/details.\n\n5. Start a new DeepSeek chat. Upload the PDF. Just say \"This was our previous discussion.\" If successful, DeepSeek will read your whole PDF and then summarize your previous discussion. You can now continue where you left off.\n\nMost other browsers should have a \"Save to PDF\" feature so you can do this. If not, get Bullzip PDF Printer or something. Nothing gets printed to your physical printer, it's just creating a PDF of the whole web page.\n\nHope that helps some ppl.",

Rather than uploading large(content-wise) pdfs and exhausting your tokens in a chat, you should have your preferred AI generate a comprehensive summary template that's condensed to be AI readable. That's what I use for Claude to get around chat length/token limits. Have the template generated, post your new summary template in the chat containing the content you want to continue in a new chat, have Deepseek or whatever AI you're using generate a summary using the template you provided, post that summary in your new chat. \n\nYou'd save a lot of tokens this way. If you want to test the accuracy of the summary, edit the message where you had the summary generated then tell Deepseek or (x) AI you're going to provide a summary based on the contents of your current chat in the next message and you want it to gauge the accuracy of the summary. If it's missing details, fill in what it missed. Provide your summary in the next message. If everything is good, you're ready to start your new chat.",

      "text": "Here's an exerpt from my story that I've been using Deepseek to edit. I've done my own research on the Opium Wars, Taiping Rebellion, Meeker Massacre on the Ute, I've listened to Ghosts of Gold Mountain. When I have some extra cash there are other books that I want to invest in for research. YouTube videos on the Meeker Massacre and kind of delving into Native American boarding schools. That's where I learned about Kill the Indian. Save the man.\n\nFallout critiques on capitalism and by extension American imperialism. I wanted to use that platform to critique another time in history.\n\nThe weight of a thousand stares bore down on Jiang as he walked with Lenore through Silverton proper. He kept his spine straight and his shoulders squared, letting the hostility wash over him like water off an oilskin duster.\n\nHis tinted glasses no longer acted as the shield they once did. Before, white folks' ignorance was like armor; they’d squint, unsure, guessing Native or Mexican. Now, in a town filled with fear, the glasses made him look like someone hiding something. \n\nHe didn't like being marked, and neither did Len.\n\nFrom what he gathered from Mr. Chu and what Lenore gathered from Mrs. Chu, Carla wanted to raise her child, Ute, to pass down her heritage and culture.\n\nJiang considered Boone's wish to keep the child in Silverton to be beyond dishonorable. To tear a child away from its mother’s culture was like the Manchu forcing the queue on the Han, an act of submission masked as order, an erasure disguised as love. \n\nEven if Boone had good intentions, the outcome was a prison for the soul. The thought of that love, distorted into a tool of erasure, clenched his jaw. \n\nA memory came up, as sharp as a piece of porcelain. \n\nThe weight of Toopah’s hand on his shoulder, the muted command to hide the girls. Holding his breath in the dark, with their muffled whimpers in his ears, the earthy taste of dust and salt on his tongue. \n\nHe was the guardian because he was unseen. A Chinese boy in an Ahwahneechee home, the agent would ignore him and continue their search.\n\n\nOr Aa Ba’s low voice, recounting the Catholic missionaries in Guangdong. How church crosses were a prelude to foreign guns and the sweet, suffocating smell of opium.\n\nHe understood the urge to preserve. Everywhere, the fight was the same: to defend a way of life while the country was dismantling, bleaching, and labeling what it deemed savage or heathen.\n\nIt all added up. Sheriff Andy’s failure to investigate, even if he saw Carla as a daughter. In the ledger of this land, people like her, people like us, didn’t merit an entry. \n\nThey entered the sheriff's office. The room reeked of stale cigarettes; Deputy Beagle, Boone, Vargas, and Marshal Jackson were nowhere to be seen. Compared to yesterday’s crowd, the office seemed empty.\n\nSheriff Andy sat alone at his desk, studying a map with a cigarette between his fingers. The late-morning rays warmed his dark brown skin.\n\nHis finger traced a line on the map, brows furrowed in thought, unaware of anyone's presence until the hinges squeaked when Jiang closed the door behind them. \n\nJiang slouched his shoulders and stuffed his hands into his duster pockets. He needed to understand how the sheriff used authority. So he played into the quiet stereotype, keeping his tinted glasses on.\n\n“How’d the perimeter check go, Beagle?”\n\nThe grandfather clock struck eleven. At last, the sheriff's gaze lifted. Sheriff Andy’s gaze met Len's, then his. \n\n“I did not realize a man of my status could be a lawman,” Jiang said, a hint of humor in his voice. \n\nThe sheriff’s lip twitched in amusement as he took a long drag from his cigarette. He exhaled a slow curl of smoke toward the ceiling, then ground the butt out in the ashtray. “Neither did I. But here we are.”\n\nLenore hooked her thumbs in her belt loops. “As much as I enjoy small talk, sheriff—we got some questions ya might answer.”\n\nThe sheriff leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms. His focus remained on Jiang, whom he saw as the real threat. \n\nHe might be dangerous, but she was too, if given the chance. The sheriff viewed Len as a hotheaded, loudmouthed farmhand who didn't understand her place among adults.\n\n“Figured this wasn’t a social call,” Andy said, his gaze still fixed on Jiang. “What do you want to know?”\n\nHe stepped forward, shoulders relaxed, pretending to be compliant. The act was still ongoing, but less convincing now. A flicker of recognition flashed across the sheriff’s face, as if he’d just seen a ghost.\n\n“I see what you’re doing, Mr. Hsu,” he said, fingers drumming on his arm. “Colored man learns to make himself small. White folks in charge don’t like being questioned. The difference is, my authority’s always on trial—for being a negro.”\n\n“Don’t give me the ‘quiet John Chinaman’ routine in here,” Andy said, squaring his shoulders. “I see the bounty hunter behind the act.”\n\nJiang’s shoulders stayed slack as he shifted his weight. “But you are a man with power, a badge, and we are men without. My partner and I should respect your badge.”\n\nHis lips curled into a slight smile. “Can’t say you weren’t raised with manners.” Andy straightened his posture, his gaze lingering on Jiang, his expression saying, Keep your partner in line. He gave a single, slow nod, granting them the floor.\n\n“We are looking into the disappearance of Carla Boone, sheriff,” Jiang said, his voice level. “We were told you might have information.”\n\nLenore stepped forward, just half a pace, her thumbs still hooked in her belt loops. “We heard she was pregnant.”\n\nThe sheriff smoothed the map. His face softened as regret spread across it. His hands went still, resting flat on the paper. When he looked up, the tough lawman had returned.\n\n\"Who told you that?\" he asked, his voice soft.\n\n“Deputy Boone inquired that we look into his wife's disappearance,” Jiang spoke up.\n\nThe sheriff clasped his hands on the map. “So he's still looking,” he said, his voice going soft. “What do you want to know?”\n\nJiang glanced at Lenore, clasping his hands together at his waist. She replied with a tilt of her chin. \n\n“Sheriff, how close were you to Carla?” he asked.\n\nSheriff Andy leaned back in his chair, the old wood creaking. His professional mask slipped, revealing a moment of tiredness. The wrinkles on his face deepened into his skin, aging him further.\n\n“Close?” he said, his voice lower now. “I raised that boy. Promised his father I would, right before the man died in my arms at Petersburg. Boone was closed off for a long time. Hardened. Then he met Carla.” \n\nA faint, almost wistful smile touched his lips, gone as quickly as it came. “Was like watchin’ a damned flower bloom in a desert. She was tough, mind you. Didn’t suffer fools, and most of this town qualified. But with him? She was sunshine. He’d look at her, and for the first time since he was a child, he’d look peaceful.”\n\nHe picked up his cold coffee, stared into the mug, and set it down again without drinking. “Carla became family. My family. So you tell me how close I was.”\n\nShe shifted her weight, leaning toward Jiang. He didn't expect that kind of backstory: a surrogate father and his adopted son. \n\nUpdate: Thanks for the upvotes! I'm still editing this chapter. This is a rough draft. I was originally writing in the other co-protagonist Lenore's POV, but it felt wrong. So I changed it to Jiang's/James. Deepseek is helping me with sensitivity writing (I don't have money for a sensitivity reader), historical fact checker making sure what I've researched is handled with care and depth. ",
