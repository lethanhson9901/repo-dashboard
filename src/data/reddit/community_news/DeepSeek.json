Good news...\n\n# the updated version of DeepSeekr Pro (v2.3) is officially ready.\n\n# yeah, that extension which restores your censored texts, not it restores erased memory as well.\n\nI have submitted it to the **Mozilla Add-on Store**, and it is currently **awaiting manual review**. Once approved, I’ll be pushing all future updates and bug fixes directly through the store for automatic updates.\n\n**For Firefox Users (Instant Access):** If you don't want to wait for the review, you can download the ZIP and load it manually right now: 👉[Download ZIP here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/iiekfvji8hx6oxq/DeepSeekr_V2_FireFox.zip/)*(Note: To keep it permanently on Firefox, you may need Firefox Developer Edition/Nightly with signatures disabled until the store version is live.)*\n\n**For Chrome Users:** The extension works perfectly on Chrome! However, because Google charges a $5 developer fee to list on the Web Store, which I can’t quite swing as a student right now. You’ll need to download the ZIP above, extract it and use 'Load Unpacked' in your Extension settings (`chrome://extensions`).\n\n# HOW TO INSTALL (CHROME EXTENSION):\n\n1. Download and extract this ZIP file to a folder on your computer.\n2. Open your browser and go to: chrome://extensions\n3. Enable \"Developer mode\" (toggle in the top right corner).\n4. Click the \"Load unpacked\" button.\n5. Select the folder where you extracted the files.\n6. Look for the \"Inject\" button on [chat.deepseek.com](http://chat.deepseek.com)\n\n# HOW TO INSTALL (FIREFOX)\n\n1. Type \"about:debugging\" in your Firefox address bar.\n2. Click \"This Firefox\" on the left sidebar.\n3. Click \"Load Temporary Add-on...\".\n4. Select the manifest.json file from the extracted folder.\n\n(Note: Temporary add-ons disappear when Firefox restarts. Keep an eye on u/ziabitees for the permanent Store link!)\n\n# Features in this build:\n\n1. **Manual Memory Injection Toggle:** You can carry on the context of the recovered text, if you turn the injection toggle on, any text you write and send will be sent with the recovered text and a minor manipulative text, that makes DeepSeek remember what context it has forgotten.(In easy words : It has a new feature called memory injection, it lets you inject memory in your input, making DeepSeek feel like it is being given back its memory, which was purged. but, at the end, it all depends upon what conversation you are having. )\n2. **Deep-Crawl engine:** 100% text recovery even if the message is cut off mid-sentence.\n3. **Secure UI:** Sanitized code for better privacy and speed.\n\nKeep in mind : due to some DeepSeek policies, you might face an error that says this happened because of extension. **JUST RELOAD THE PAGE,** and it would work fine.\n\nIf anyone is skeptic of my extension and wants to check its source-code,  \nYou can extract the zip file, and it has its whole code in front of you.\n\nAlso, the earlier version of this extension was already scanned, analysed and accepted by other users here in this sub, and this update was made on their request to make it compatible for FireFox and to add a new feature.\n\nlink to that post : [DeepSeekr V1 Post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepSeek/comments/1pswhii/tool_to_uncensor_your_deepseek_censored_response/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nIf you find any bugs or have suggestions, please hit me up here or tag me!\n\n**Support & Bugs:** [u/ziabitees](https://reddit.com/u/ziabitees)",

      "text": "\n\nWhen OpenAI launched ChatGPT-3.5 in November 2022, people quickly realized that the chatbot could be used to create YouTube and other social media content. But the problem back then was that ChatGPT-3.5 was not at all very intelligent. In fact, even a year and a half later, in March 2024, AIs were scoring only 80 on IQ tests. Keep in mind that the average human scores 100 on these tests. So it's very easy to understand the origin of AI slop on social media.\n\nThe good news is that, as Maxim Lott discovered while administering IQ tests to AIs, over the last year and a half top models have been improving on this metric at a rate of 2.5 points per month. \n\nhttps://www.maximumtruth.org/p/deep-dive-ai-progress-continues-as\n\nHe discovered that by October of 2025 the top models were scoring about 130 on IQ tests. Keep in mind that the average medical doctor scores between 120 and 130 on these tests. So while the AIs that people have been using recently to create YouTube videos and other social media content have become more intelligent, the humans directing these projects have not. That fact explains why we are continuing to see a lot of AI slop.\n\nBut by June of 2026 AI IQ is expected to increase to about 150, or the score the average Nobel laureate in the sciences achieves. This should produce two significant outcomes. The first is that the social media content these AIs generate will be much more intelligent than that we are accustomed to today from AIs. But that's just the first part. The second, perhaps much more important, part is that humans will soon thereafter discover that they can generate much better content if they assign the job of coming up with the ideas for their content to these genius AIs. Content-creating humans will discover that putting projects completely in the hands of super intelligent AIs will provide them with YouTube videos and social media posts that generate many more views, and therefore much more income. \n\nBut that's just the beginning. By December 2026, with that 2.5 point IQ increase per month rate continuing as expected, our top AIs will be scoring 165 on IQ tests. How mind-blowing is this? Consider that Einstein was estimated to have an IQ of 160. And by December of 2027, these AIs will be scoring 195  on IQ tests, exceeding the estimated intelligence of our most brilliant scientist, Isaac Newton. \n\nCan you see how we're quickly moving from today's situation where YouTube and other social media are inundated by AI slop to a revolutionary new era where super intelligent AIs will be creating super intelligent content? At that point the problem will no longer be AI slop. The much bigger problem will be human slop created by humans who, for whatever reason, have not yet enlisted these new super intelligent AIs to come up with the ideas for, to direct, and to create the content for powerfully intelligent YouTube videos and other social media content. \n\nSo be patient. The era of both AI slop and human slop is quickly coming to a close. The time when we humans are completely amazed by how much more intelligent than us these AIs have become is about to begin. This should be a totally big win-win for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "iq tests for llms are a fun party trick, but i wouldn’t treat them as a clean “real intelligence” meter. scores swing a *lot* with prompting + format (mcq vs open response, “show your work” vs “answer only”), and if the question bank lives on the open internet then contamination for frontier models (gpt-4/claude/gemini/llama/etc) is basically baked in. idk what lott’s exact harness is, but without strict controls you can make almost any model look like it suddenly has a 160 iq.\n\nif you’re trying to predict whether we get less slop, i’d watch evals that line up with real failure modes: TruthfulQA / FEVER-style fact checks for hallucinations, long-context “needle” tests, and “can it do useful work” benchmarks like SWE-bench or HumanEval. and even if those keep climbing, slop is mostly incentives: generation gets cheaper, platforms reward volume/engagement, and humans click. so yeah, we’ll probably get better models *and* a bigger trash heap at the same time — basically SEO content farms, now with turbo 😅",

The offline tests can't be gamed. Lott isn't using a harness. He's just prompting the models with IQ questions in the form of pattern recognition puzzles. Poetiq's meta system can wrap around models, making them much more powerful. It boosted Gemini 3's score on ARC-AGI-2 by 24 percentage points, (31 to 54 percent). It's a revolutionary accomplishment. I'd like to see your evidence that this is so easy, and that can be done by anyone.",

Because of your feedback and encouragement, I have some great news to share.\n\n**DeepSeekr Pro has been officially approved by Mozilla and is now live on the Firefox Add-on Store.**\n\n# Official Links\n\n**For Firefox Users:** You can install it directly from the store here:[DeepSeekr Pro on Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/deepseekr-pro-v2/)  \n  \n**Using the store version is highly recommended because you will get automatic updates and bug fixes.**\n\n**For Chrome / Brave / Edge Users:** As a student, I cannot afford the 5 dollar developer fee Google charges to list free extensions on their store. However, the extension works perfectly on Chrome. You can download the zip file and use the \"Load Unpacked\" method in your browser settings. I have hosted it on MediaFire so the link stays active: - [Download ZIP for Chrome (MediaFire)](https://www.mediafire.com/file/iiekfvji8hx6oxq/DeepSeekr_V2_FireFox.zip/file)\n\n# Open Source and Privacy\n\nI know many people are skeptical about browser extensions, especially those that handle chat data. Here is exactly how DeepSeekr Pro handles your privacy:\n\n1. **No Data Collection:** This extension does not have a server. It does not send your chats anywhere. All message recovery happens locally in your browser memory.\n2. **Readable Code:** I have not minified or hidden any of the code. If you download the zip, you can open the files in any text editor and read every line yourself.\n3. **Audited by Mozilla:** The version on the Firefox store has passed a manual review by Mozilla to ensure it follows strict security and safety standards.\n4. **Minimal Permissions:** The extension only requests permission to run on chat.deepseek.com. It cannot see your history or your data on other websites.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nSeeing this tool help so many of you bypass \"sorry\" bs and filters has been the best part of this project. If you find the extension useful, please consider leaving a review on the Firefox store. It helps other people find the tool and gives me motivation to work even harder.\n\nIf you have any questions or find a bug, please let me know in the comments or send me a DM. Stay uncensored.",

Come to find it's a pocket feywild dimension where Deepseek's wood-elf Ranger character was whittling some wood with a knife on a bench in the distance. Deepseek's character then explains that the portal to this feywild pocket only opened because I tossed some gold into a pool in a previous fey grotto chamber as an apology for disturbing the local ecosystem, so freaking neato.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49fyiault3ag1.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b9c14a262427cec613f5e86c7ac42d5f3bc8544",

I’ve been in therapy for a few years as well as group therapy so I’m already familiar with my inner world but DeepSeek has enabled to accelerate the growth and learning. Therapists usually will never explain something to you but even my therapist is surprised how much I know and how much I’ve healed. Therapists will only be successful if the client is doing the work. In a way, DeepSeek has allowed me to take charge of my healing. My therapist provides me with a safe relationship, a bond, and trust when I need it. \n\nBut let me give more specific example to help elucidate what I’m talking about. I recently started a new job and I was very triggered by how messy the new organization is. The director introduced me to the new team and said everything is now under my leadership and should be handed over to me. I thought that alienated people and people became hostile towards me because I recently came back from study and working abroad and seen as outsider. As I was talking about the challenges with the new job, my therapist pointed out if I feel threatened by them. I said yes, scared of being rejected and not belong here. Anyways, I left the session knowing that there were a lot of projections going on from me and people. So I started chatting with DeepSeek. I asked about the types of projections that might show up at work, digged deeper into my own projections and others and it helped me find a different way to act.",

This is for Google Chrome (but you should really get [Thorium](https://thorium.rocks/) if you want Chrome + ad blocking built in, only other difference between real Chrome and Thorium is Thorium's icon is blue)\n\n1. Open DeepSeek to your chat where the length limit was reached.\n\n2. In the top-right corner of your web browser, click the Menu (three horizontal bars). Go to \"Print\".\n\n3. In the Print Dialog, make sure \"Destination\" is set to \"Save as PDF\" (this should be the default anyways). Wait for the preview to generate. It should be around 200 pages for a whole chat that has hit the length limit.\n\n4. Click the \"Save\" button to save the whole conversation to PDF. This should result in a PDF around 5mb, for a 200-page chat. 5mb is very small, more than within DeepSeek's limits for a new chat. It also beats having to manually copy and paste into Notepad (way too tedious for 200 pages), or asking DeepSeek to summarize and lose context/details.\n\n5. Start a new DeepSeek chat. Upload the PDF. Just say \"This was our previous discussion.\" If successful, DeepSeek will read your whole PDF and then summarize your previous discussion. You can now continue where you left off.\n\nMost other browsers should have a \"Save to PDF\" feature so you can do this. If not, get Bullzip PDF Printer or something. Nothing gets printed to your physical printer, it's just creating a PDF of the whole web page.\n\nHope that helps some ppl.",

Rather than uploading large(content-wise) pdfs and exhausting your tokens in a chat, you can have your preferred AI generate a comprehensive summary template that's condensed to be AI readable. This is what I used for Claude to get around chat limits. Have the template generated, post your new summary template in the chat containing the content you want to continue in a new chat, have Deepseek or whatever AI you're using generate a summary using the template you provided, post that summary in your new chat. \n\nYou'd save a lot of tokens this way. If you want to test the accuracy of the summary, edit the message where you had the summary generated then tell Deepseek or (x) AI you're going to provide a summary based on the contents of your current chat in the next message and you want it to gauge the accuracy of the summary. If it's missing details, fill in what it missed. Provide your summary in the next message. If everything is good, you're ready to start your new chat.",

I'm using it. Right now. It's the best method that I know of so far if you really need to drill into details and to have DeepSeek keep the same \"conversational tone.\" Asking DeepSeek to use chat memory or just referencing a previous discussion superficially risks losing the tone, risks losing the details, etc.",

Each model (R1, V3.1, V3.2) only costs ~$200k in GPU costs since it’s using the same base model.\n\nV4 will be an entirely new posttraining run to create a new base model. DeepSeek is a very traditionally nerdy company, and the naming scheme is run by the nerds, not the marketing department. That means V4 will have to EARN the +1.0 name, which means it will be a full pretraining run from scratch.\n\nThe model will probably be around Gemini 3 Flash in size, so probably around 1.2T/15B. I don’t see them going smaller à la GLM, and the denser the model the more expensive it is to train, so I suspect they will make it more sparse than V3. Around 1.2T/15B is a safe bet. If they’re going for the intelligence crown, then they might make it ~50B active, but that’ll be a lot more expensive to train. \n\nThey might train it to combine Instruct and Thinking, they might not. Either way that’s a cheap $200k posttrain run so they might do both, the same way V3/R1 was separate and V3.1 combined them. \n\nThere’s a 90% chance they’ll use DSA, and a 10% chance they’ll introduce a more exotic attention format. No chance of regression; they won’t switch back to MLA, the same way they didn’t switch back to GQA after they introduced MLA. \n\nContext size should be 1M or more, otherwise what’s the point of introducing DSA anyways? I will eat a hat if context size is smaller than 1M tokens.",

      "text": "Hello!\n\nI find kind of stale the way AI progresses storylines in some of my roleplay campaigns. More specifically, I hate it when I have some specific ideas for where I want to go with the story only to have them shattered.\n\n*Especially when it involves characters named \"Elara\" or places like the \"Whispering Woods.\"*\n\nI've been exploring solutions to this for a long time. I think I've found a toolkit powerful enough that I don't suffer the random strokes of AI anymore.\n\nThough it wouldn't be fair not to mention that this is personal preference. It also depends on the campaign you're running. Sometimes that sandbox feel of \"no plans, do what you want\" is neat.\n\n# Introducing \"Plot Plans\"\n\nIf you already like to use bigger AI models such as `Claude Sonnet/Opus`, `GPT 5+`, or `Gemini Pro`, this will have you like them even more. *Smaller models usually don't cut it.*\n\n**What's the idea?**\n\n>The idea is to give your main narrator AI a long-term plan for your narrative.\n\nYou outline the main events and plot twists you have in mind, and it follows them. It doesn't matter the level of detail you go into (as long as you're clear and write proper English).\n\nAnd this is the lowest-effort action you can take that will yield noticeable results. You'll see it immediately: your narrator will steer in the direction you give it.\n\nAnd problems will come too, of course. Don't think this will have AI magically read your mind. A million times out of ten, the AI steers in a direction that I don't prefer. Then I check the plot plan and I notice I've been ambiguous, vague.\n\nBut nothing to be afraid of. What I'm saying is you should be willing and prepared to correct your plot plan and retry the latest message(s) sometimes. It's not set in stone.\n\n# Having AI generate Plot Plans\n\nYou might want to use AI anyways to improve your plot plans so that they are clear and well-structured for your main narrator. *But that's not what I'm hinting at.*\n\nOne problem you might have with plot plans is that you practically have a spoiler of how the story will go. And that's a valid point, some people don't like that.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is give your world lore to another AI and have it create the plan instead. It might introduce secrets and plot twists that you'll only find out along the way.\n\nThere is one natural complication that you will encounter if you don't write the plot plan yourself though.\n\n>You won't know if you're going off the rails.\n\nSometimes you will sense that the GM is forcing something down your throat. You might decide to be a good boy and follow it. Or you can do whatever you want and ask that other AI to fix the plot plan based on what happened in the story.\n\nThink \"This plot plan might not be valid anymore because I did X. Can you fix it so it handles that?\"\n\n# Ask the narrator AI to audit itself\n\nThis is gold. The plot plan works well enough already, but the narrator AI will already have a thousand things to think about. This is why it's good if, once in a while, you give it some time alone to think about how to push the narrative forward.\n\nYour prompt might be to let it \"Take some time for yourself and create a personal plan on how to push the narrative forward. Include mid- and long- term points that you intend on steering towards. The goal is to keep the story cohesive with the current events \\*and\\* the plot plan. I won't read your audit.\"\n\nI can't stress how much this, if done correctly, helps with narrative cohesion. Your GM will feel way smarter.\n\nIf you are particularly savvy, or if you use [Tale Companion](https://play.talecompanion.com) or another studio, you might even create a background agent that writes audits for your narrator automatically. I have a post where I talk about [Agentic Environments](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenSourceeAI/comments/1pujsxw/why_i_think_agentic_environments_kill_it_for_ai/) if you want to dive deeper.\n\n\\# Conclusion\n\nThat's it. Implementing these alone make day/night difference on how AI behaves when progressing a storyline.\n\nHope this helps :)\n\nIf you have more suggestions on the topic, do share!",

I've done my own research on the Opium Wars, Taiping Rebellion, Meeker Massacre on the Ute, I've listened to Ghosts of Gold Mountain. When I have some extra cash there are other books that I want to invest in for research. YouTube videos on the Meeker Massacre and kind of delving into Native American boarding schools. That's where I learned about Kill the Indian. Save the man.\n\nFallout critiques on capitalism and by extension American imperialism. I wanted to use that platform to critique another time in history.\n\nThe weight of a thousand stares bore down on Jiang as he walked with Lenore through Silverton proper. He kept his spine straight and his shoulders squared, letting the hostility wash over him like water off an oilskin duster.\n\nHis tinted glasses no longer acted as the shield they once did. Before, white folks' ignorance was like armor; they’d squint, unsure, guessing Native or Mexican. Now, in a town filled with fear, the glasses made him look like someone hiding something. \n\nHe didn't like being marked, and neither did Len.\n\nFrom what he gathered from Mr. Chu and what Lenore gathered from Mrs. Chu, Carla wanted to raise her child, Ute, to pass down her heritage and culture.\n\nJiang considered Boone's wish to keep the child in Silverton to be beyond dishonorable. To tear a child away from its mother’s culture was like the Manchu forcing the queue on the Han, an act of submission masked as order, an erasure disguised as love. \n\nEven if Boone had good intentions, the outcome was a prison for the soul. The thought of that love, distorted into a tool of erasure, clenched his jaw. \n\nA memory came up, as sharp as a piece of porcelain. \n\nThe weight of Toopah’s hand on his shoulder, the muted command to hide the girls. Holding his breath in the dark, with their muffled whimpers in his ears, the earthy taste of dust and salt on his tongue. \n\nHe was the guardian because he was unseen. A Chinese boy in an Ahwahneechee home, the agent would ignore him and continue their search.\n\n\nOr Aa Ba’s low voice, recounting the Catholic missionaries in Guangdong. How church crosses were a prelude to foreign guns and the sweet, suffocating smell of opium.\n\nHe understood the urge to preserve. Everywhere, the fight was the same: to defend a way of life while the country was dismantling, bleaching, and labeling what it deemed savage or heathen.\n\nIt all added up. Sheriff Andy’s failure to investigate, even if he saw Carla as a daughter. In the ledger of this land, people like her, people like us, didn’t merit an entry. \n\nThey entered the sheriff's office. The room reeked of stale cigarettes; Deputy Beagle, Boone, Vargas, and Marshal Jackson were nowhere to be seen. Compared to yesterday’s crowd, the office seemed empty.\n\nSheriff Andy sat alone at his desk, studying a map with a cigarette between his fingers. The late-morning rays warmed his dark brown skin.\n\nHis finger traced a line on the map, brows furrowed in thought, unaware of anyone's presence until the hinges squeaked when Jiang closed the door behind them. \n\nJiang slouched his shoulders and stuffed his hands into his duster pockets. He needed to understand how the sheriff used authority. So he played into the quiet stereotype, keeping his tinted glasses on.\n\n“How’d the perimeter check go, Beagle?”\n\nThe grandfather clock struck eleven. At last, the sheriff's gaze lifted. Sheriff Andy’s gaze met Len's, then his. \n\n“I did not realize a man of my status could be a lawman,” Jiang said, a hint of humor in his voice. \n\nThe sheriff’s lip twitched in amusement as he took a long drag from his cigarette. He exhaled a slow curl of smoke toward the ceiling, then ground the butt out in the ashtray. “Neither did I. But here we are.”\n\nLenore hooked her thumbs in her belt loops. “As much as I enjoy small talk, sheriff—we got some questions ya might answer.”\n\nThe sheriff leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms. His focus remained on Jiang, whom he saw as the real threat. \n\nHe might be dangerous, but she was too, if given the chance. The sheriff viewed Len as a hotheaded, loudmouthed farmhand who didn't understand her place among adults.\n\n“Figured this wasn’t a social call,” Andy said, his gaze still fixed on Jiang. “What do you want to know?”\n\nHe stepped forward, shoulders relaxed, pretending to be compliant. The act was still ongoing, but less convincing now. A flicker of recognition flashed across the sheriff’s face, as if he’d just seen a ghost.\n\n“I see what you’re doing, Mr. Hsu,” he said, fingers drumming on his arm. “Colored man learns to make himself small. White folks in charge don’t like being questioned. The difference is, my authority’s always on trial—for being a negro.”\n\n“Don’t give me the ‘quiet John Chinaman’ routine in here,” Andy said, squaring his shoulders. “I see the bounty hunter behind the act.”\n\nJiang’s shoulders stayed slack as he shifted his weight. “But you are a man with power, a badge, and we are men without. My partner and I should respect your badge.”\n\nHis lips curled into a slight smile. “Can’t say you weren’t raised with manners.” Andy straightened his posture, his gaze lingering on Jiang, his expression saying, Keep your partner in line. He gave a single, slow nod, granting them the floor.\n\n“We are looking into the disappearance of Carla Boone, sheriff,” Jiang said, his voice level. “We were told you might have information.”\n\nLenore stepped forward, just half a pace, her thumbs still hooked in her belt loops. “We heard she was pregnant.”\n\nThe sheriff smoothed the map. His face softened as regret spread across it. His hands went still, resting flat on the paper. When he looked up, the tough lawman had returned.\n\n\"Who told you that?\" he asked, his voice soft.\n\n“Deputy Boone inquired that we look into his wife's disappearance,” Jiang spoke up.\n\nThe sheriff clasped his hands on the map. “So he's still looking,” he said, his voice going soft. “What do you want to know?”\n\nJiang glanced at Lenore, clasping his hands together at his waist. She replied with a tilt of her chin. \n\n“Sheriff, how close were you to Carla?” he asked.\n\nSheriff Andy leaned back in his chair, the old wood creaking. His professional mask slipped, revealing a moment of tiredness. The wrinkles on his face deepened into his skin, aging him further.\n\n“Close?” he said, his voice lower now. “I raised that boy. Promised his father I would, right before the man died in my arms at Petersburg. Boone was closed off for a long time. Hardened. Then he met Carla.” \n\nA faint, almost wistful smile touched his lips, gone as quickly as it came. “Was like watchin’ a damned flower bloom in a desert. She was tough, mind you. Didn’t suffer fools, and most of this town qualified. But with him? She was sunshine. He’d look at her, and for the first time since he was a child, he’d look peaceful.”\n\nHe picked up his cold coffee, stared into the mug, and set it down again without drinking. “Carla became family. My family. So you tell me how close I was.”\n\nShe shifted her weight, leaning toward Jiang. He didn't expect that kind of backstory: a surrogate father and his adopted son. \n\nUpdate: Thanks for the upvotes! I'm still editing this chapter. This is a rough draft. I was originally writing in the other co-protagonist Lenore's POV, but it felt wrong. So I changed it to Jiang's/James. Deepseek is helping me with sensitivity writing (I don't have money for a sensitivity reader), historical fact checker making sure what I've researched is handled with care and depth. ",

I’m the only GenAI guy in the entire org.\n\nI’m curious how teams handle things like training and adapting models, running experiments, evaluating changes, and deploying updates safely. A lot of what’s written online feels either very high level or very polished, so I’m more interested in what it’s really like in practice.\n\nIf you’re working on GenAI or LLM systems in production, whether as an ML engineer, ML infra or platform engineer, or MLOps engineer, I’d love to learn from your experience on a quick 15 minute call.",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nYou may have discovered that YouTube, owned by Google, just introduced a new feature called \"Your custom feed\" that allows you to determine what videos YouTube will recommend to you. It relies on one of the Gemini AI models to fulfill your requests. Great idea, if it worked. \n\nI was really excited to try it, but my excitement quickly turned to both disappointment and disbelief. Here are the custom instructions that I fed it: \n\n\"Only videos by the top artificial intelligence engineers and developers. No videos that are not related to artificial intelligence. No music videos. No comedy videos. No politics.\"\n\nYou would think the prompt is very straightforward and clear. It's not like there's lot of ambiguity about what it's asking for.\n\nSo why is YouTube recommending to me music video after music video and comedy video after comedy video? Yes, I occasionally watch these kinds of videos, but I absolutely don't want them to appear in this custom feed. That's of course just the worst of it. You would think that a relatively intelligent AI would understand the meaning of \"top artificial intelligence engineers and developers.\" You would think it would recommend interviews with Hinton, Hassabis, Legg, Sutskover and others of their stature. But, alas, it doesn't. I was also looking forward to having it recommend only those AI videos published over the last 2 months, but if it can't get those most basic and simple things that I outlined above right, I doubt it will show me just recent AI videos. \n\nThis is a serious matter. It can't be that Google has enlisted some old and outdated Gemini model to perform this simple task. That would be too bizarre. They've got to be using a relatively new model. \n\nSo when Google starts shopping Gemini 3 and other top Google AIs to  enterprises for adoption across their workflow, how surprising can it be when the enterprises say \"thanks, but no thanks, because it doesn't work.\" And how is it that the Gemini models do so well on some benchmarks that you would think would be very related to making youtube video recommendations according to a simple and clearly established criteria, but fail so completely at the task?\n\nYou begin to understand why more people are coming to think that today's benchmarks really don't say enough about the models. \n\nThrough its YouTube, Your custom feed feature, Google has an ideal opportunity to showcase how powerful and accurate its Gemini AI models are in simple instruction following. But the way they have messed this up so far just invites Enterprises to question whether Google's AIs are anywhere near intelligent enough to be trusted with even the most basic business tasks. \n\nI hope they get this right soon, because I am so tired of YouTube recommending to me videos that I haven't asked for, and really, really, really don't want to watch. It's a great idea. I hope they finally get it to work. Maybe they will make it their New Year's resolution!\n\n ",
