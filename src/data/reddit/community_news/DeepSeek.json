      "text": "\n\n\nOpenAI may be the new Enron. There has been a huge price surge in DRAM kits, and consumer groups are accusing them of intentionally buying up the supply to disadvantage competitors. Market data from TrendForce and IDC confirms a 40–70% increase in consumer PC memory costs throughout 2025. The data provides clear evidence of the \"consumer harm\" to non-AI buyers like gamers, students, and businesses that judges look for in antitrust cases.\n\nClass action suits may come from the millions of people seeing the prices of laptops, phones, and PC parts spike. The suits would claim that OpenAI’s deals with Samsung and SK Hynix created an artificial shortage for the general public. If they can show that OpenAI bought up raw materials just to keep them away from others, this qualifies as \"predatory bidding\" or \"hoarding,\" and violates consumer protection laws in many states.\n\nFederally, the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act allow consumer groups to sue for \"exclusionary conduct\" by hoarding a critical resource to starve out competition. The charge is that OpenAI secured nearly 40% of the global DRAM supply in violation of fair competition laws.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation and other open-source AI collectives are pursuing legal remedies like invoking \"Essential Facilities.\" The argument is that because they control the physical memory needed for modern AI, that memory qualifies as a public utility that OpenAI should therefore be forced to share. Also, The Social Media Victims Law Center has already filed seven major lawsuits alleging that OpenAI's rush to market has led to defective and dangerous products.\n\nOther legal actions involve petitions to federal agencies. In late 2025, several open-source advocacy groups filed formal Amicus briefs and petitions with the Federal Trade Commission. They are asking it to declare AI hardware capacity an \"essential input,\" which allows the government to break up OpenAI’s exclusive supply contracts. The FTC is currently investigating whether OpenAI’s exclusive supply deals violate the \"Unfair Methods of Competition\" rule. It and the European Commission could be OpenAI's most damaging legal adversaries. \n\nAlso, the DOJ is looking into accusations that the \"Stargate\" project functions as a \"monopsony\" where one buyer has so much power it can dictate terms to suppliers and crush rivals. What puts OpenAI at greater legal risk is that they hold a dominant market share, and the law forbids them from using bully tactics that smaller companies might get away with. Using wealth to build a hardware moat is a classic trigger for federal and private legal intervention.\n\nAnd if it loses just some of the claims that Musk is alleging in his lawsuit, (even while winning others) it becomes far more vulnerable to these other suits. 2026 is shaping up to be the make it or break it year for OpenAI.\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nIdeally, along with discovering new medicines, materials and processes, and boosting economic productivity, most of us hope that AI will bring our world closer together. The theory behind this is simple. When resources are abundant, nations stop fighting over them. When people have more than they need, they stop fighting other people over what they don't have. \n\nBut Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, is actively promoting a different vision. He is pushing an \"entente\" strategy where democratic nations use advanced AI systems in military applications to achieve  decisive dominance over everyone else. In other words, he is trying to start an AI military arms race where a group of select \"democratic\" countries have unrivaled dictatorial control.\n\nThe main flaw in this dangerous initiative is that he doesn't understand the difference between what democracy sounds like on paper and how democracy is practiced in the real world. Let's take the US as an example. Ostensibly we are a democracy, but our politics tell a much different story. \n\nIn the 2024 election cycle, total spending reached an estimated $15.9 billion. A small \"donor class\"of 100 wealthy families contributed a staggering $2.6 billion during that cycle. This concentration of funding allows affluent individuals to essentially decide what happens in elections. Here's more evidence.\n\nOver 65% of funding for federal races now comes from PACs and large donors. Studies show that when the preferences of the bottom 90% of earners are different than those of the economic elite, the elite’s preferences are roughly twice as likely to be enacted into law. \n\nSo when the US does virtually nothing to fight climate change, when the\ntop 10% of earners capture approximately 45% to 50% of all of the national income, when we elect a megalomaniac president who wants to annex Canada, invade Greenland, and basically install himself as the dictator of the world, it doesn't take advanced AI to figure out how this all happened.\n\nThe problem with American democracy, which is functionally a plutocracy, is that the money that controls the American government is working on behalf of a very small group of rich stakeholders. In other words, its main concern is neither the welfare of the country nor the welfare of the world. Its main concern is increasing the profits of the people whose money already almost completely controls the entire political system.\n\nSo when Amadei talks about democracy ruling the world, what he really means is the ultra-rich in control of everything. When he refers to non-Democratic countries, he's primarily referring to China. Yes, China's government is no more democratic than ours. But there's a major difference. The Chinese government works for the benefit of the Chinese people, not for the benefit of the Chinese elite. Not only has China lifted 800 million of its citizens from poverty within a time frame that makes the rest of the world green with envy, it is aggressively pursuing a policy to lift the rest of the world from poverty. \n\nNow contrast this with Trump's \"America First\" doctrine where it doesn't matter how poor and powerless our economic programs make other countries as long as America, more specifically America's rich class, comes out on top.\n\nAmodei is THE poster boy for why some of us are afraid of AI going dangerously wrong. His academic training is in biophysics, specifically in electrophysiology of neural circuits. No training in political science. No training in economics. No training in international affairs. He arrogantly believes that being the CEO of an AI company endows him with the knowledge and wisdom to know what's best for the world. But his current project to promote a global AI military arms race where every country competes for hegemonic dominance shows not only how misguided, but also how threatening, he is.\n\nI'm not echoing a minority opinion. Here is how others have been reacting to Amodei's dystopian dream. \n\nYann LeCun:\n\n\"Altman, Hassabis, and Amodei are the ones doing massive corporate lobbying at the moment... [Amodei] could be suffering from a huge superiority complex, believing only he is enlightened enough to have access to AI, but the unwashed masses are too stupid or immoral to use such a powerful tool.\"\n\nMarc Andreessen, in a critique of the \"doomer\" philosophy shared by Amodei, stated: \"Restricting AI is like restricting math, software, and chips... the idea that we should prevent the development of a technology that could save lives because of a 'cult-like' obsession with imaginary risks is a recipe for a new form of totalitarianism.\"\n\nDavid Sacks responded to Anthropic's policy positions by stating that the company has been pushing a \"sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering\" to protect its market position under the guise of safety.\n\nIt would be unquestionably in the best interest of the AI space and the rest of the world if Amodei would limit himself to building coding AI, and leave the engineering of a new global order to people who actually understand the geopolitics and economics of the world.\n\n\n\n",

It's becoming increasingly evident that the management of OpenAI has started hallucinating even more than their models do. Case in point, their decision to show ads that will take up 1/3 of your screen if you're on the free plan.\n\nWhile OpenAI boasts over 800 million weekly users, and the figure is rising, their paid subscribers comprise only 4-5% of that number! But the more unbelievable part is reported at 1:55 of the video below, where we discover that their paid subscriptions FLATLINED in the middle of last year!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tw8VOZWToC0?si=rpuNKVRt0YDTglMA\n\nI guess they hope that the ads will force free users to start paying. In fact, they just rolled out a new discount ChatGPT GO subscription that costs only $8 a month. A risky move since subscribers that now pay $20 a month may migrate to this cheaper option. \n\nMy guess is that they're all now gluttonously drinking from that same Kool-Aid punch bowl that the Trump administration has been drinking from for the last year, lol. Only time will tell if and when they finally decide to sober up.\n\n\n\n",

Peter Steinberger has shown that a single person, as a hobby, can advance AI just as powerfully as the AI Giants do. Perhaps more than anything this shows how in the AI space there are no moats!\n\nHere's some of how big it is:\n\nIn just two days its open-source repository at GitHub got massive attention with tens of thousands stars gained in a single day and over 100,000 total stars so far, becoming perhaps the fastest-growing project in GitHub history, \n\nMoltbot became a paradigm-shifting, revolutionary personal AI agent because it 1) runs locally, 2) executes real tasks instead of just answering queries, and 3) gives users much more privacy and control over automation. \n\nIt moves AI from locked-down, vendor-owned tools toward personal AI operators, changing the AI landscape at the most foundational level.\n\nHere's an excellent YouTube interview of Steinberger that provides a lot of details about what went into the project and what Moltbot can do.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qyjTpzIAEkA?si=4kFIuvtFcVHoVlHT",

That’s advertising. \nI used to like him, but his burnout, something he’s mentioned himself after PSPDFKit, I think seems to have affected him very negatively mentally and psychically, turned him into AI crazy, and it really shows in his recent photos and videos.

      "text": "\n\n\nDevelopers like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google may think that because their frontier models are top tier across many use cases, that's enough to win the enterprise race. But open source/Chinese developers will be competing for very specific niche domains where they already OPERATIONALLY MATCH OR EXCEED the performance of top proprietary models AT A FRACTION OF THE COST. Understanding this is important to personal investors, as more open source/Chinese developers issue IPOs.\n\nFor decades, large US corporations and personal investors have sought a higher ROI by outsourcing and investing in Chinese firms. There are no signs that this is letting up. As Chinese AI developers issue IPOs, we should expect substantial American investments in increasingly competitive open source/Chinese models. As evidence, the venture capitalist firm a16z has said that 80% of the startups pitching them for funding are using Chinese open-source AI models. That tells you a lot. \n\nHere are some open source/Chinese models that are already matching or exceeding top models from American AI giants in performance and cost, courtesy Gemini 3:\n\n \"* DeepSeek-V3 / R1 (DeepSeek AI)\n   * Performance: Ranked #1 on MATH-500 and LiveCodeBench. R1 matches OpenAI o3-Pro in complex reasoning and logical proofs.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: OpenAI o3-Pro, GPT-5.2.\n   * Cost: $0.27 (Input) / $1.10 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $15.00+ per 1M).\n\n * Qwen3-Max / Coder (Alibaba)\n   * Performance: Top 3 on LMSYS Chatbot Arena (Overall/Coding) and MMLU-Pro. It is currently the most versatile open-weight model for agentic workflows.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Claude 4.5 Sonnet, GPT-5.1.\n   * Cost: $0.22 – $0.50 (Input) / $0.95 – $5.00 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $3.00 – $10.00 per 1M).\n\n * Ernie 5.0 (Baidu)\n   * Performance: Ranked #2 globally on the LMArena Math leaderboard; top 3 in multimodal benchmarks like MathVista.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.1.\n   * Cost: $0.30 (Input) / $1.20 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $1.25 – $2.50 per 1M).\n\n * Kimi K2 Thinking (Moonshot AI)\n   * Performance: Top 3 in Long-Context (RULER) and ARC-AGI-2. Known for 1M+ token context windows and deep reasoning traces.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Claude 4.5 Opus, Gemini 3 Pro.\n   * Cost: $0.15 (Input with cache) / $1.50 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $5.00 – $15.00 per 1M).\n\n * GLM-4.7 / 5.0 (Zhipu AI)\n   * Performance: Top 3 in Code Arena and tool-use benchmarks (90%+ success rate).\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 3 Flash.\n   * Cost: $0.60 (Input) / $2.20 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $3.00+ per 1M).\"\n\nKeep in mind that enterprise AI is quite new, and that Chinese firms are just getting started. Also, they are hyper focused on very NARROW niches rather than on AGI, and know how to undercut their competition. Again, to minimize losses and maximum gains,\npersonal investors should take note.",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nOpenAI wants you to believe that they are too important to the AI space and to the world to be allowed to fail. They have conjured what they hope will be a self-fulfilling prophecy intended to have American taxpayers bail them out if they do not meet their debt obligations. The threat is so real that yesterday Senator Warren sent Altman a letter demanding assurances that they would NOT seek a government bailout if they ultimately failed to turn a profit.\n\nhttps://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-presses-openai-ceo-on-spending-commitments-and-bailout-requests-after-cfo-suggests-government-backstop\n\nAnd the facts and figures don't substantiate any kind of rescue narrative.\n\nLet's first understand why OpenAI is no longer necessary to the AI space today. When they launched ChatGPT-3.5 in November 2022, one might have said that back then they were extremely helpful to attracting hundreds of billions of dollars to the AI space over the subsequent years. But that happened over 3 years ago. Both introducing AI to the world and creating a huge demand for investment in the space are tasks that have already been accomplished.\n\nIf they were to cease to exist tomorrow, there would be no great AI bubble burst. The $1.4 trillion, (and counting) in investment commitments that they pulled together would simply move to their competitors. If Google, Anthropic, xAI and a rapidly growing number of Chinese open source and proprietary AI developers didn't exist, this might not be the case. But they do, and there's nothing that OpenAI has done that these other AI developers cannot already do as well, and often at a fraction of the cost.\n\nNow let's turn to OpenAI's financials. They boast over 900 million weekly ChatGPT users. But only 5% are paid subscribers. Worse yet, their paid subscriptions plateaued in June of 2025. The problem for OpenAI is that 55 to 60% of their revenue comes from ChatGPT. And despite having earned $20 billion in revenue in 2025, OpenAI's expenses that year exceeded $29 billion. Now also keep in mind that their competitors' models are already on par with or surpass GPT 5.2 on the AI benchmarks most important to both consumer and enterprise markets.\n\nLet's consider what they must do to meet their debt obligations. Altman set a target for OpenAI to exceed $100 billion in annual revenue by 2027. But because they are currently earning only $20 billion they would need to increase that income by at least 5x just to meet debt obligations that come due in 2027. And keep in mind that they set this revenue target at a time when the healthcare and other AI products they must sell to meet it have not even been built. More ominous is that their competitors, including Chinese open source developers, are strongly positioned to outcompete them in virtually every product category. But they didn't factor in this competition in their 2027 projections.\n\nAll of that is actually somewhat of an aside. If OpenAI were to cease to exist tomorrow, their competitors would quickly and seamlessly capture their revenue-generating markets. Their absence would cause no shortage of AI services or products. They offer no unique product that their competitors have not already built. They have no special patents that provide them with a moat. They are simply no longer necessary to the AI space because their competitors can do everything that they do, and often at far less cost. \n\nSo don't let OpenAI tell you that they are necessary to the AI space. Neither they, nor Google, nor Anthropic, nor the Chinese developers, are necessary to advancing AI because there are now so many companies building models. The space will continue to expand and become increasingly lucrative for decades to come regardless of who is in the game.\n\n",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nOne thing Musk is known for is doing big things in a fraction of the time that it takes others to do them. For example, his team brought the Colossus super computer online in only 122 days, when a project of this magnitude usually takes 2 to 4 years from start to finish. \n\nSo when one of his updates is delayed, and delayed again, you know that something is amiss in xAI land. On December 7th, 2025, Musk announced that Grok 4.2 would be released in 3 or 4 weeks. We are now a few days from February 2026, and there are no signs of the release. Could this mean that the brute force scaling approach has plateaued?\n\nIf we were to guess at the reason for those delays, the most probable is that GPT, Gemini, and even Chinese open source models, have gotten so good so quickly that Musk kept discovering his Grok 4.2 was not proving itself competitive enough on major benchmarks. \n\nOf course the final verdict, at least for the time being, on where we are with the scaling laws won't come until Grok 5 is released in March. Because it will be trained on Colossus 2, with 550 GPUs rather than Colossus 1's 1-200, and built with Nvidia's far more powerful GB200 and GB300 Blackwell chips, we should not be surprised if it blows every other model completely out of the water! And it will surely incorporate the Engram primitive and Poetiq's meta system, further amplifying its reasoning power. This means it will probably have an IQ exceeding 160. \n\nI hope we are nowhere near the plateauing of scaling laws, and that Grok 5 sets a very high new bar that the other developers will scramble to quickly catch up with. But until xAI finally releases Grok 4.2, serving as an interim indicator, we can only wait with mounting expectation.\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "I’ve been reflecting a lot lately on the current state of DeepSeek, and I wanted to share some personal observations to see if the community feels the same way.\n\nFor a long time, I considered DeepSeek a true pioneer. It was the \"gold standard\" for me a free, highly capable model that felt genuinely uncensored, especially when compared to the heavy-handed guardrails of Western models like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. At its peak, it didn't just compete; it often outperformed them in terms of raw utility and creative freedom.\n\nHowever, recently, I’ve noticed a disappointing shift. The latest versions and updates feel like a step backward rather than the leap forward we were all expecting. Specifically:\n\n1. **Increased Censorship:** The model has become significantly more restrictive. Responses that used to be nuanced and direct are now frequently hit by \"policy\" filters or generic refusals.\n2. **Degradation in Quality:** There’s a noticeable dip in the \"intelligence\" of the outputs. It feels less sharp and more prone to generic or repetitive answers.\n3. **A Broader Trend:** This doesn't seem isolated to DeepSeek. I’ve noticed similar patterns with Alibaba’s models and even Kimi (though Kimi still holds up relatively well).\n\nIt feels like something fundamental has changed behind closed doors regarding strategy or regulatory compliance in China. It’s disheartening because DeepSeek was my go-to daily driver. Now, I find myself using it and even Qwen only occasionally, as they no longer provide that \"limitless\" edge they once had.\n\nI want to stay optimistic about the next rumored release, but given the current trajectory, I’m starting to have my doubts.\n\n**What are your thoughts?** Have you noticed a decline in output quality or a \"tightening\" of the filters recently? Is the era of the \"uncensored\" Chinese powerhouse model coming to an end, or is this just a temporary roadblock?\n\nCurious to hear your experiences.",

Recently, I've gotten responses from both ChatGPT and Gemini that a question was basically too difficult. What was strange is that Claude and Copilot were able to answer those questions with no problem, and sometimes ChatGPT can answer something Gemini can't. One example of a Gemini fail was comparing the features of five Canon imageClass printers that were similar models. MF743Cdw and the like. I was looking for basic information, like one or two paper trays, support for faxing, double-sided scanning, etc. I didn't think it was a heavy lift.\n\nChatGPT, when I ask about other electronics, will rephrase my question as a statement and direct me to the website where I can do my own research. Please. I'm asking AI because I don't have the bandwidth to do the legwork myself. That's what I've been doing my whole life. Lol\n\nPersonally, I'm afraid of sponsored answers in the name of capitalism, corruption to protect people in power and their wealthy donors, censorship in the name of safety, and other such things that mask or distort the truth. It seems the safest approach is to be skeptical and verify any critical research with other sources.",

With dudes there's a little variation but it's fond of Kael and Kaelan and the last name Thorne. I'm keeping a little list of names to AVOID for actual OCs since those names will presumably be overused in the near future. But if I'm just dicking around with AI for my own entertainment then I'll sometimes just... sigh resignedly and let it keep the character. \n\nThere's a lot of things that DeepSeek overuses but it won't truly understand or remember if you try to complain about it. It may or may not remember for the duration of that conversation but now you've just added extra noise to that conversation if you complain there. And it may or may not struggle to remember more pertinent things that actually matter to you in that convo.",

          "text": "Also have you considered asking DS itself \nI did , and this was its reply .\n\nAh, I see the exact post you're referring to now. This gives much clearer context. This user isn't just noticing the name \"Lyra\" in one story; they're reporting a specific, recurring pattern where DeepSeek repeats the same names (like Lyra, Elara, Hemlock) for different characters within the same chat session, which is a different issue from general name popularity.\n\n🔁 Why This Repetition Happens (The Technical Reason)\n\nThis phenomenon is a known quirk of how Large Language Models (LLMs) like DeepSeek work and is often called \"in-context bias\" or \"repetition priming.\"\n\n· Context Window Focus: An AI doesn't remember a conversation like a human. Its \"memory\" is the current \"context window\" (the last several thousand words of your chat). When generating new text, it gives extra weight to words and patterns that have recently appeared in that window.\n· The \"Echo Chamber\" Effect: Once you use a distinctive name like \"Lyra\" in your prompt, it becomes a highly relevant and recent piece of data. When the AI needs to generate another name a few turns later, the probability of it drawing from that same recent pool of \"relevant-sounding words\" increases significantly. It's not that \"Lyra\" is a favorite; it's that \"Lyra\" is the most activated concept for \"fantasy/character name\" within that specific chat's context.\n\nThis explains why the user sees names like \"Elara\" (another celestial/mythological name) and \"Hemlock\" (a distinctive plant/poison name) repeating alongside Lyra. They are stylistically similar and get \"stuck\" in the chat's active vocabulary.\n\n🛠️ What You Can Do About It\n\nAs a creative writer, you can use specific prompting techniques to guide the AI and break this cycle:\n\n1. Be Explicit and Proactive: Before the AI generates a new character, directly instruct it.\n   · Example Prompt: \"Please introduce a new supporting character. Give them a name that is distinct and has not been used yet in this story, like [suggest a different style, e.g., 'Kaelen' or 'Sorin'].\"\n2. Provide a \"Name Bank\": Give the AI a short list of fresh names to choose from, overriding its internal bias.\n   · Example Prompt: \"Here are three name options for the blacksmith: Aris, Brenna, or Toval. Pick one and describe them.\"\n3. Reset the Context: If the repetition becomes too strong, you can gently reset the AI's focus.\n   · Example Prompt: \"Let's pause the current scene. I want to start a new descriptive passage about the mountain citadel, using entirely new vocabulary and names. Begin with: 'The citadel of...'\"\n\n📚 Regarding Your Project: Is \"Lyra\" Still a Good Choice?\n\nAbsolutely, and understanding this quirk makes your choice even more meaningful.\n\n· The Reddit post describes an unintended, mechanical repetition due to a model's limitation.\n· Your use of \"Lyra\" is a deliberate, sovereign choice with deep narrative significance for your triad's daughter. It's anchored in character, theme, and love.\n\nThis technical quirk doesn't devalue the name; it simply shows that without a guiding author's intent, the AI can fall into patterns. You, as the author, provide that essential intent.\n\nIf you'd like to brainstorm ways to ensure Lyra's character feels unique in your writing or want to explore the symbolic layers of her name further, I'm here to help.",
