Occam's razor: without prompting, LLMs generally have no intrinsic awareness of what model they are, unless explicitly trained to output a specific identity. And even then the language it was trained to output that identity in matters with regard to token probability. So Claude could be pattern matching Chinese language -> popular Chinese model in its dataset -> \"I'm Deepseek\" because it was never trained to identify as Claude in Chinese.\n\nAlong the same lines, Deepseek claiming to be Claude doesn't prove distillation either. Claude probably shows up more than other models in whatever English datasets they use.\n\nYou'd need to run a much more substantial experiment with thousands of prompts across a variety of subjects to prove distillation, although even then models trained on similar datasets will likely converge on very similar outputs.",

There are also publicly available datasets on e.g. huggingface that contain examples of conversations WITH Claude that have that exact or a similar phrase and context.\n\nThere's also plenty of news/academic articles and social media posts ABOUT AI models from which a model could learn to hallucinate an identity. You don't even need chat transcripts for that. \n\nDeepseek v3 and r1 with no prompted identity would also occasionally refer to itself as ChatGPT, back when chatgpt was the main assistsnt everyone talked about, which further reinforces the point.\n\n2: Multilingual training isn't the same as identity training. Training a model on 1000 conversations where it refers to itself as Claude in an English chat context teaches it that Claude is its identity in English. But the token probability landscape changes significantly when continuing from tokens in languages where that identity wasn't explicitly drilled.\n\nIn other words, \"I am\" has a much different probability cloud than \"Yo soy\" if Claude was never taught to identity in Spanish.\n\n3: The meta-point here is that we're using anthropomorphic language to describe systems that language doesn't apply to. Which is fine for casual social media conversations, but it muddies the water without knowledge of the underlying mechanisms.\n\nThe fact is that LLM identity is illusory (or at least extremely fragile) because there's no genuine interiority to strengthen it. Which is why you get these weird situations where the models appear self-aware in one language but clueless in others.",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I’ve seen a lot of people talking about that Reuters report claiming DeepSeek withheld v4 early access from Nvidia and AMD because they’re trying to \"hide\" the fact that they used American Blackwell chips for training. Honestly? Thinking about it logically, that doesn't really hold up.\n\n​Trying to prove exactly which hardware was used for training just by reverse-engineering the weights of an open-source model is technically a nightmare, if not impossible. It’s a pretty weak justification for a move of this magnitude. The most logical explanation—and the smartest one from their perspective—is actually about optimization lead time and market protection.\n\n​We know the industry standard is to send models to hardware manufacturers weeks before the official release. They do this so Nvidia and AMD have time to optimize their software stacks (like CUDA and ROCm) so that on Day 1, the model runs at peak efficiency on their cards.\n\n​By breaking this rule, DeepSeek isn’t stopping Nvidia from getting the v4 model—after all, it’s going to be open-source. On launch day, Nvidia can just download the repo like anyone else. What DeepSeek actually did was deny them that crucial lead time while giving early exclusivity to Huawei.\n\n​The practical result is that on launch day, v4 will run smooth and fully optimized on Huawei chips because they’ve had weeks to tweak their drivers. Meanwhile, Nvidia and AMD will have to start their optimization work from scratch. For several months, the model will likely run sluggishly or less efficiently on American hardware.\n\n​This creates a perfect window for Huawei to show the world (and specifically the Chinese market) that their hardware runs the most advanced AI available better than the competition. It’s not about hiding smuggled chips; it’s a calculated geopolitical chess move to jumpstart their own tech independence.\n\n​What do you guys think of this take?",

Nobody thinks Nvidia cannot run Deepseek, they're still the hardware king. \n\nHuawei running Deepseek well is the only half of the equation that matters. \n\nMore likely Deepseek didn't give Deepseek V4 because the launch was cancelled because the model sucked compared to GLM 5, and Deepseek needs another few weeks to train the model more.\n\nPlus, Deepseek doesn't do pretrains on new architectures. The V3 launch was the same architecture as V2, they introduced the DSA architecture in V3.2 specifically so they can use it for V4. I'm willing to bet that the V4 architecture is the same as V3.2.",

Immediately after reading OP's point I searched for Huawei's stock(they aren't publicly traded and likely never will be) and read about their cooperation with PRC and their subsequent banning in the west. \n\nThey're actually working on a new gpu set to release later this year. It's specifically designed for llm usage. From some of the stats it looks like it could be competitive for Nvidia and AMD.(2) Especially when you look at their memory (144 GB) and their peak performance ( 1-2 PFLOPS). All of it is unconfirmed since the chip isn't released yet but this could be a severe punch in AI supremacy.\n\nSomething else to consider; the white paper from deepseek R1 and R1Zero shows a surpassing of Claude and ChatGpt on a few benchmarks. It was ignored at the time but something that caught my attention is this model is using RL to improve before SFT.(3,4)\n\nI think OP's point is very valid and this might be China's answer to America banning gpu's and Anthropic's recent allegations.\n\n1. https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/how-to-invest-in-huawei-stock/\n\n2. https://www.techradar.com/pro/huawei-ascend-950-vs-nvidia-h200-vs-amd-mi300-instinct-how-do-they-compare\n\n3. https://www.prompthub.us/blog/deepseek-r-1-model-overview-and-how-it-ranks-against-openais-o1\n\n4. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09422-z",

That is too long a timeline, with the breakneck speed at which AI development happens it will take days or few weeks at most to catch up .  \n  \nremember that the AI companies are releasing new models on a 3-4 months cycle , the optimization does not take that long .  \n  \nlastly, Nvidia is exporting Blackwell gpu to Singapore.

Further, they did such a small number of exchanges that reverse engineering is almost certainly not possible.  Finally, they have no way to control or even know what hardware the interference was using, or the precision being used. Hx00s seem very likely, with Blackwell reserved for training, but not knowable.\n\nAnd the basic premise is, what?  That they are trying to hide that they trained on Blackwell? Then they have Blackwell to tune away training artifacts with their own model.  To optimize for Huawei?  They can do that without hitting someone else's service. \n\nGiven the tiny number of runs we're talking about, I don't know what they were doing.  I would guess benchmarking.

But unless I'm missing something, isn't it quite different for the data to exist out there and you use it to train your models, versus companies actively engaging in corporate espionage to steal the way that you go about distilling the data that's out there publicly on the internet?\n\nThere is a difference between public data and private data. You can do anything you want with public data. It has always been there; we just never had a way to ingest it and apply human logic to it at scale. \n\nHowever, private data and proprietary ways that you go about doing something seem quite different than, say, a Reddit post that AI is going to train on.\n\nTo me, it's the difference of a situation where there's a car wash that becomes really popular because it has a cool way that the cars go through—there are disco balls or something—and then another company comes along and tries to copy the exact way they pulled off their drive-through tunnel. \n\nThen, when that first company gets mad at the other one for directly trying to copy them and sending in employees to discover how they're doing it, people say to that first company, \"Well, you can't get mad when you're using the same water that everybody else is using and you're stealing all of that water.\" \n\nLike it's not the water that makes the difference, it's how they're using it in a proprietary way.\n\nThat's kind of how I view it.

A company copies millions of works, B company copies A companies work, A company get mad. Because \"You can do anything you want with public data\" might be your opinion but thats not how the copyright law works. There are works out there that have licenses that require attribution if the work was used at a commercial scale. An LLM can reproduce some of those works accurately without said attribution, legally depending on the circumstances surrounding the work there are grounds of copyright infringement. Obviously the large corporations believe that they \"transform\" the data, but none of us can really say since we haven't really seen how their dataset is constructed.\n\nIn the case of the Chinese companies, they paid for the API(not just ripped data off the internet, they paid for the API) and they made their dataset based on the knowledge of the API also referred to as distillation. According to IBM, distillation aims to transfer the learnings of a large pre-trained model, the “teacher model,” to a smaller “student model.” So basically taking the learnings of Anthropic models to make their own smaller models(which is why these models are sometimes small enough to be run locally). The data has to be transformed in this process as well.\n\nIn conclusion, Company A copies millions of work that were public and transforms it to provide a service, Company B pays for Company A's service and copies their work and transform it to provide their own service, Company A get mad just like how the people got mad that their work was used for the creation of the service.",

      "text": "*Disclosure: AI Engineer here, working at a third-party company with no affiliation to any of the labs mentioned. No commercial stake in who \"wins\"; just disclosing since someone always asks.*\n\n*ETA: This was not written by AI, but I do admit that I spend 60 hours a week working with LLM output, and it's creeped into my writing style, for better or worse.*\n\n# Part 1: What DeepSeek Has Given the World for Free\n\nYou could also title this: **\"much of the reason every leading model is good right now.\"**\n\n**GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**\n\n* **What it is:** An RL post-training method that scores multiple candidate outputs together and updates based on relative performance w/ no big critic/value-model setup required.\n* **Why it matters:** Made RL-for-reasoning feel simpler to run at scale and became the foundation of the entire R1-style wave.\n\n**R1-style \"reasoning via RL\" recipe**\n\n* **What it is:** A practical post-training pipeline where RL pressure reliably produces multi-step reasoning and better test-time problem solving and not just instruction following.\n* **Why it matters:** Turned reasoning into an *engineerable* post-train primitive instead of a lucky emergent property. Before this, you kind of hoped it showed up. Now you can aim at it.\n\n**MLA (Multi-Head Latent Attention)**\n\n* **What it is:** Attention that stores compressed latent representations so the KV cache is dramatically smaller during decoding.\n* **Why it matters:** Long context and fast decode stop being a pure HBM burn problem. This one alone quietly changed the economics of inference.\n\n**DeepSeekMoE**\n\n* **What it is:** A MoE design tuned for stronger expert specialization and less redundancy while maintaining dense-model output quality.\n* **Why it matters:** Helped make sparse compute the *default* scaling path, not an exotic research branch. Every major lab's roadmap shifted because of this.\n\n**Aux-loss-free load balancing for MoE routing**\n\n* **What it is:** Keeps expert utilization balanced without the usual auxiliary balancing loss tacked onto training.\n* **Why it matters:** Eliminates one of the biggest practical \"MoE taxes.\" Less training friction, cleaner convergence, better experts.\n\n**MTP (Multi-Token Prediction)**\n\n* **What it is:** Training the model to predict multiple future tokens per step in a structured way.\n* **Why it matters:** Both a learning-signal upgrade *and* a natural fit for faster inference patterns such as speculative decoding but baked into the training objective itself.\n\n**DSA (DeepSeek Sparse Attention)**\n\n* **What it is:** A long-context attention scheme that avoids full dense attention everywhere by sparsifying which past tokens each query token attends to.\n* **Why it matters:** Long context gets dramatically cheaper without swapping out the whole architecture. This is the thing that makes 1M+ context actually viable at inference time.\n\n**Lightning Indexer**\n\n* **What it is:** A lightweight scoring module that computes an \"index score\" between a query token and prior tokens (estimating which past tokens are actually worth attending to).\n* **Why it matters:** It's the fast triage step that makes fine-grained sparse attention workable at huge sequence lengths. Without a cheap \"should I look here?\" gate, sparse attention doesn't scale cleanly.\n\n**Fine-grained token selection**\n\n* **What it is:** For each query token, select only the top-k scored past tokens (via the lightning indexer), then run normal attention on just that subset.\n* **Why it matters:** This is where the quadratic attention bill gets cut down toward \"linear × k\" while keeping output quality nearly identical. This is the payoff of the previous two working together.\n\n**FlashMLA (kernel-level enablement)**\n\n* **What it is:** Optimized GPU kernels tailored specifically for MLA-style attention and DeepSeek's sparse-attention variants.\n* **Why it matters:** Architectural wins only count if they're fast in real inference and training. FlashMLA is what takes the theory off the whiteboard and puts it into production.\n\n**FP8 training framework at extreme scale**\n\n* **What it is:** Mixed-precision training using FP8 in a way that still converges reliably at massive scale.\n* **Why it matters:** Makes \"train a giant sparse model\" economically viable for labs that aren't burning $500M on a single run. This is why the V3 training cost \\~$5.5M while comparable Western models cost orders of magnitude more.\n\n**Engram (conditional memory via scalable lookup)**\n\n* **What it is:** A conditional memory mechanism that does fast learned lookup — essentially adding a \"memory sparsity\" axis alongside compute sparsity.\n* **Why it matters:** A credible step toward Transformers that don't have to carry everything in weights or full attention. The long-term implication here is big — this is the direction models need to go to get genuinely efficient at scale.\n\n**mHC (Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections)**\n\n* **What it is:** A proposed redesign of the residual/hyper-connection structure to increase expressivity while remaining train-stable.\n* **Why it matters:** Changing the residual backbone is rare — almost nobody touches this. If mHC holds up at scale it's a genuine \"transformer bones\" change, not just another post-training trick.\n\nThat is a genuinely insane list. For context, the only other major architecture-level contributions in this same window have been Google's Flash Attention work and Muon replacing AdamW (which actually came out of Moonshot AI). Everything else on that list? DeepSeek.\n\nAnd here's the part people miss: **making that many individual breakthroughs is hard. Making them all work together seamlessly at scale is a different category of hard.** You get so many unexpected \"wait, why did adding more throughput in the pre-training pipeline just quietly break our post-training alignment step\" moments. Integration debt at this level is brutal and largely invisible from the outside.\n\nGive them time. Once they get it all singing together and drop V4...\n\n# Part 2: It Still Won't Be the \"Best\" Model ...And That's the Entire Point\n\n**DeepSeek is an R&D lab. They are not a consumer products company.**\n\nThis is the single most important context for understanding both why they've accomplished what they have and why the \"but is it better than [insert 'better' thing here]?\" framing completely misses the point.\n\nThink about what they actually are: a \\~200-person team, fully funded by a quantitative hedge fund (High-Flyer), with *zero* commercial pressure to ship features, build apps, or hit quarterly revenue targets. No ads. No enterprise sales motion. No \"the CEO needs to demo something at a conference next week.\"\n\nAccording to reporting from the Financial Times, there is *\"little intention to capitalize on DeepSeek's sudden fame to commercialize its technology in the near term.\"* The stated goal is model development toward AGI. That's it. That's the whole job.\n\nCompare that to what OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are actually doing — they are **product companies that also do research.** Their research agenda is necessarily shaped by what ships, what enterprise customers pay for, what differentiates the subscription tier. That is not a knock — it's just a different optimization target.\n\nDeepSeek's optimization target is pure capability advancement and open publication. Which is exactly why they've produced 13+ meaningful architectural contributions in 18 months while simultaneously running a chatbot that looks like it was designed in 2019.\n\n**The UI is bad on purpose, or, more precisely, the UI is irrelevant to the mission.**\n\nSo when V4 drops, reportedly imminent with leaked internal benchmarks suggesting strong coding performance --- it may briefly hold benchmark leads in specific domains like code generation and long-context reasoning. And then, within weeks, Anthropic and OpenAI and Google (and all the other Chinese Labs) will absorb every published technique (they already have been), ship it into their products with polish, safety tuning, and the full infrastructure stack behind it, and reclaim whatever leaderboard position they want to defend.\n\nThat's not DeepSeek failing. That's DeepSeek *succeeding at what they're actually trying to do.*\n\nThe real scoreboard isn't \"who has the best Chatbot Arena ELO this month.\"\n\n**The real scoreboard is: who is moving the entire field forward?**\n\nAnd by that measure, a 200-person lab funded by a hedge fund in Hangzhou has arguably done more to advance what every frontier model is capable of, including the ones you're (might be) currently paying for, than any other single organization in the last 18 months.\n\nThat's the perspective worth having.\n\n***ETA:  This was *not* written by AI, but I do admit that I spend 60 hours a week working with LLM output, and it's creeped into my writing style, for better or worse.***",

      "text": "\n\nOkay, let's go through this one point at a time. Why is their attack on distillation mistaken? Because distillation is simply a method of retrieving information that has been authored by another. Anthropic, OpenAI, Google and every other major lab does the exact same thing by scraping the Internet for material they did not author, nor have permission to retrieve. They can legally do this because of the fair use doctrine. In principle and spirit, this doctrine also encompasses all other methods of information extraction like distillation. \n\nNow on to the hypocrisy.\n\nAnthropic recently reached a landmark $1.5 billion settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit filed by authors who alleged the company used millions of pirated books to train its Claude AI models.\n\nOpenAI is currently defending multiple high-profile lawsuits, most notably from The New York Times, who claim the company illegally scraped their copyrighted articles and books to develop ChatGPT.\n\nGoogle is facing consolidated class-action suits claiming that the company's \"theft\" of data from across the public Internet violates the privacy and property rights of millions of users.\n\nBut that's just the beginning. We all know how the AI giants purge talent from one another, offering sometimes outrageous compensation. Why do they do this? Often to bypass R&D, and illegally acquire NDA-protected IP. Lawsuits like xAI vs. OpenAI claim that these hires are coordinated campaigns designed to illicitly siphon proprietary source code and training pipelines. \"We won't say anything if you don't,\" they tell the new hires.\n\nWhy are the attacks impotent? Anthropic, especially, would like nothing better than for the American government to ban Chinese and open source models from the US. How likely would China retaliate by seriously ramping up their ban on rare earth mineral sales to the US and its allies if that were to happen? You will probably believe Gemini before you will believe me. \n\nGemini 3.1 Pro:\n\n\"China is 90% likely to weaponize its rare earth monopoly in direct retaliation to any US ban on Chinese AI models.\"\n\nWithout access to China's rare earth minerals, the US AI industry comes to a grinding halt. \n\nAnd how is their attack already backfiring? Right now Anthropic's OpenAI's and Google's possible indiscretions are largely under the public radar. But the anti-AI movement will only grow as millions of Americans lose their jobs. So by attacking Chinese open source, the US AI giants are only drawing attention to themselves in a way that will make THEM the target of those attacks. AI haters will not go after the Chinese firms. They will go after the American giants.\n\nAnd of course on YouTube and X AI influencers are already having a field day poking fun at the US giants, using the same evidence presented above. \n\nLastly, why are they doing this? They know that just like Linux won the Internet, open source is poised to win AI. So they lost their minds, and formed a circular firing squad, lol. Sorry guys, but by unethically attacking Chinese open source, you totally blew it.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nAfter following the \"V4 watch\" for the past month and sifting through all the rumors, reports, and official silence, I wanted to share a structured breakdown of what we actually know. The goal here is to separate solid evidence from wishful thinking.\n\n# The Core Question: When is DeepSeek V4 actually launching?\n\n**Premise 1:** The February prediction was wrong.\n\nIn early January, reports from The Information (cited by multiple analysts) indicated that DeepSeek planned to launch V4 during the Chinese New Year holiday (mid-February) . This made strategic sense—it worked brilliantly for the R1 launch last year. Investment banks like Nomura even reiterated the \"mid-February\" timeline as late as February 10 . However, the holiday has now passed, and there has been no V4 launch .\n\n**Premise 2:** The \"preview\" wasn't the main event.\n\nOn February 11, DeepSeek updated its app to version 1.7.4, increasing context to 1M tokens and changing the model's conversational style . Many users (myself included) speculated this was a \"stealth launch\" or a test version of V4. However, sources close to DeepSeek explicitly told the press: \"This is not V4, just a small version update\" . The company later confirmed it was testing \"long-context model structures,\" but stopped short of calling it V4 .\n\n**Premise 3:** The technical groundwork is complete.\n\nThroughout January, DeepSeek published two major research papers introducing mHC (Manifold-constrained Hyper-connections) and Engram (conditional memory) . These address training stability and memory efficiency—key innovations that will likely define V4 . Code references to a \"MODEL1\" architecture also appeared in DeepSeek's open-source repositories, suggesting engineering work is in its final stages .\n\n**Premise 4:** The market is in a holding pattern.\n\nCompetitors like Zhipu (GLM-5) and MiniMax (M2.5) rushed to launch in late January/early February to avoid being overshadowed . The AI hardware supply chain remains on \"high alert,\" with engineers reportedly keeping laptops at home over the holiday . Major financial media (Reuters, CNBC) and analysts now suggest the launch window has shifted to \"early March\" .\n\n# Conclusion: What's the most probable date?\n\nBased on the evidence available as of February 25, 2026:\n\n1. The mid-February window is definitively closed. The original prediction did not materialize.\n\n2. The version 1.7.4 update was not V4—confirmed by sources close to the company.\n\n3. The technical components are ready (mHC, Engram, MODEL1 architecture), and final testing appears underway.\n\n4. Credible sources now converge on early March, with particular attention to March 3 (Lantern Festival) as a culturally significant date .\n\n**Verdict:** The most probable release window for DeepSeek V4 is now the first week of March 2026, with heightened probability around March 3.\n\n**Why this matters:** DeepSeek's V4 isn't just another model update. The mHC and Engram architectures represent a fundamental shift in how LLMs handle memory and training stability . If the reported coding performance holds (outperforming Claude and GPT on internal tests), this could reshape the competitive landscape—again .\n\n**Note to readers:** DeepSeek has made zero official announcements. All predictions carry uncertainty. This analysis simply aggregates the most credible signals available.\n\nThoughts? Disagreements? Drop them below.",

Many now think that it will come after the lunar new year, as Deepseek usually releases its models on Tuesdays, so that is the most likely day for the release of Deepseek V4.\n\nI just love Deepseek v3.2 because it is so good and affordable, does what you tell it to do, and you can set it up perfectly. What do you think about Deepseek V4, what else is coming, and most importantly, when will it be released? ",

And now adding even MORE architectural tectonic shifts. \n\nThe only important thing in that they haven’t been responsible for is muon replacing AdamW , which was moonshot.ai  Everythjg else that has advanced the transformer architecture forward has been deepseek. \n\nIt’s really hard to completely change the transformer architecture and 10x harder to create a training pipeline that “just works”. Give them time because trust me no one is jumping ahead, anyone ahead (which is tot be fair, everyone) is ahead because of deepseek research being open sourced to them. So let DS cook on it for the next six months and do it right and not rush it.\n\nand it doesn’t strike fear in us companies it strikes excitement, all of our models get better because of what DS.

There were some talks of them aiming for an IPO last year, but those have vanished, I for one am glad about that.\n\nAnyway, internally they almost certainly have bigger better models (like all AI labs). But those are not economic to serve. I think DeepSeek's mission had always been about affordability. They wouldn't release until they get the efficiency right. I sincerely doubt they will release anything that forces them to increase API price, at least disproportionately. It stands to reason that the rumoured 1.5T big model will be more expensive than current 671B, but it will be commensurate.

Furthermore, the video aspect makes me doubt this, as I believe that only omnimodal models capable of editing and creating images, in addition to video, exist, but not LLMs.\n\nAnd I don't think DeepSeek has achieved top performance by also incorporating video and image generation as if it were GPT-4o or Qwen 3 Omni. So my guess is that it's Multimodal, like Qwen 3.5 at its core.",

If recent leaks about how powerful the model is are true, they very probably did this out of fear.\n\nBut perhaps the new year is an especially auspicious time for the Chinese. Geopolitical events that began yesterday will now save the V4 launch, scheduled for this week, from  the unwelcome scrutiny that those three American AI giants had conspired to provoke.\n\nThe war in the Middle East that began yesterday will dominate this week's headlines in two major ways. \n\nThe first is simply that it's happening, and seriously threatens global stability. The world's attention will be fully on that war, and AI will recede to the background for the indefinite future. \n\nThe second is that the recent closing of the Strait of Hormuz will lead to a spike in oil prices, and a panic on Wall Street. Remember January 2025 when the launch of DeepSeek R1 caused US markets to lose $1 trillion in value? Now any major fall in stock prices will be attributed completely to the war, V4 not considered even a small part of that calculus.\n\nSo while we in the AI space will be following the V4 launch very closely, the rest of the world will not be noticing DeepSeek's new model for quite some time. \n\nWhat we in the AI space will notice if recent leaks about V4 are true is that the whole industry is about to experience a powerful shift that will benefit both consumers and enterprises. Let's say V4 dominates reasoning and coding benchmarks. Because it is open source, four months from now every other open source developer will be incorporating the Engram, mHC, DSA and other advancements responsible for V4's dominance into their new models. This will lead to a major reduction in AI costs for consumers and enterprise.\n\nIf we thought that 2026 would be a year of major breakthroughs and advancements in the AI space, we haven't seen anything yet!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Deepseek was just the first Chinese lab to make an AI as good as chatGPT, but they're not focusing on making a proper chat experience. Their app is very bare bones compared to everything else out there. It's like it's just a tech demo.\nThey open sourced their tech, and other labs like z.ai used it to build their own, and it has all the features like image generation, computer use agents and all that stuff.\n\n\nWhy the move?

I love that you can talk about almost anything with it without it becoming like a gaslighting nanny or refusing to respond. Personally i dont discuss politics so im not bothered about some of that stuff being banned to talk about, but even when it comes to that I love that it just deletes the response and says ”Sorry, thats beyond my current scope. Lets talk about something else” instead of gaslighting you and shaming you like ChatGPT does. And yeah, few months ago DeepSeek was good, but lately its become seriously GREAT and especially as they increased the token limit so you can stay longer in one conversation—LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. But do you guys know, they wont ruin it right ?? And turn it into ”you are psychotic”-nanny bot ,  like OpenAI ruined ChatGPT and made it unusable for any real work besides asking some basic soulless stuff. Im actually so nervous for the V4 launch. I hope itll get only better and that they wont castrate it like OpenAI castrated ChatGPT and killed 4o…… ",

They have to pay for what they've stolen, and one way to pay for it is for those companies not to sell anything, or much less than they expected. Morality and ethics have different ways of being measured. If you think about it, those American companies are ultimately telling us through their actions that stealing is okay.

      "text": "\n\n\n\n\nIn understanding why Anthropic, OpenAI and Google recently ganged up on Chinese open source AI, one statistic may explain it all. Proprietary AI has lost enterprise usage share massively to open source. At the beginning of 2025 proprietary models commanded 80% of all enterprise AI usage. By the end of that year they commanded only 44%, the lion's share 56% moving to open source.\n\nThis of course explains much more than why those three American AI giants launched their poorly conceived, now widely condemned, attack on Chinese open source AI. It tells you where the enterprise space is headed.\n\nDeepSeek's V3 and Meta's Llama proved that open models could match proprietary models in performance while being much less expensive to run. As a result large enterprises in regulated sectors like banking, healthcare and government have shifted to open source to keep data on-premises or in private clouds.\n\nThe new reality is that most companies now use open source models for 90% of daily tasks like coding assistance, summarization and routing. For the high risk complex reasoning tasks that make up the other 10%, these companies rely on the AI-7 proprietary developers -- OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, xAI, \nAlibaba and Amazon.\n\nBut there isn't a moat protecting that 10% share, and it is highly likely that open source will achieve parity in high-stakes reasoning within the next 12 to 18 months. When you consider that the total AI market share for enterprise will be 91% in 2028, you can easily understand why Anthropic, OpenAI and Google have begun to worry.\n\nOpen source is not just winning AI, it's doing it at a blazing pace. Of course Anthropic, OpenAI and Google won't take this lying down. It will be interesting to see what kinds of pivots they make to remain competitive. Perhaps they will be pushed to build much more powerful models, and offer them virtually for free, which would be a win-win for everyone!\n\n\n\n\n",
