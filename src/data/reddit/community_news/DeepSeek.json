I stopped working on the project some 2 months ago after it was functional.\n\nNow here's the interesting part: I knew C++ and I wanted the program in C#. Initially I used Meta and ChatGPT which taught me C# basics. I gradually shifted to DeepSeek which was much more efficient and accomplished the tasks with much lesser lines of code. There was one last bit of functionality where all of my coding engines (DeepSeek, Meta and ChatGPT) failed. Claude was able to get that part up and done in the first prompt.\n\nI later had my entire code reviewed by 3 engines (ChatGPT, DeepSeek and Claude) after it was functional. DeepSeek gave an encouraging review (8.3/10), ChatGPT was skeptical though (6.8/10). Claude was completely technical in its review, telling me the pros and cons of my design without giving me a score out of 10, initially. It then gave me the lowest score of all (5.5/10). I then debated Claude over its score and it gradually gave me 6.5, but nothing higher than that.",

Although Ascend chips are only 80% as efficient as Nvidia chips, so more of them are needed, their much lower cost allows open source developers to save a lot of money during training. Nvidia's H100 chips cost between $30-40,000 each while the Ascend 910B costs between $12-13,000 each. Also the 910B needs about half the power than an H100 does.\n\nAt only 9 billion parameters, GLM-Image can run high-speed inference on consumer-grade hardware, making it much more affordable to open source startups.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this proof of concept will lead to open source models that compete with proprietary ones on the leading benchmarks, but open source AI just got a big boost forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As a specific chip design matures, factories get better at producing it with fewer defects, which lowers the cost per functional unit. Additionally, older \"legacy\" chips become cheaper as the industry shifts its most expensive equipment to newer, more advanced technology, allowing older factories to churn out components for cars and appliances at a fraction of their original price. Over the long term, Moore’s Law also drives down the cost of computing power by allowing more transistors to be packed into the same amount of silicon.",

      "text": "\n\nAs AIs become ready to provide lower cost quality services to enterprises, smaller models that can be run locally will ensure that new open source startups outcompete the AI giants. There are several reasons for this.\n\nThe first is that for security reasons businesses would prefer to run their AIs locally.\n\nThe second is that AI will allow for much greater specialization within the various enterprise domains. For example, within international tax services there are many specialities like Transfer Pricing, State and Local Tax (SALT), Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credits, Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Tax, Indirect Tax (VAT/GST/Sales Tax), etc. By specializing in one of these areas, the AI startups can provide much better service than is ordinarily available from tax firms that cover everything. \n\nThe third is that because these new startups will be lean, they will be able to ship much faster than the AI giants can.\n\nThe fourth is that because they are specializing, these new startups will provide far better product support to help businesses integrate the AIs into their workflow.\n\nThe fifth is that new iterations will be far easier for these specialized AI startups to develop and ship, again because of their small size and specialization. \n\nThe sixth is that the kinds of RAG systems that are necessary to ensure accuracy will be much easier to build for small specialized AI agents than for much larger frontier models.\n\nThe seventh is that open source AIs can provide enterprises much more, and easier, means of adjusting their AIs to best serve their particular business workflow.\n\nThe reality is that the frontier labs employing thousands are too large to effectively and inexpensively offer enterprises the best AI agents and support. These giants are saddled by too much bureaucracy to be able to compete in what promises to be a rapidly changing specialized AI enterprise space.\n\nThis understanding should provide great hope for the many young computer science graduates who are finding that entry-level jobs in AI are becoming increasingly scarce. Also, these AI agents can become much less expensive because they can be built and run in other countries where costs are often much lower than in the United States. It seems clear that the best way to prepare for the small, open source, model enterprise AI adoption that will happen over the next few years is to launch lean new startups that specialize in the various services that businesses need.",

      "text": "\n\n\nAnnie Altman's claim that Sam sexually abused her for ten years could not only ruin Altman and his family's reputation, it could also spell the collapse of OpenAI. The public is willing to tolerate a lot, but child sexual abuse doesn't usually fall within that category.\n\nAnd that's not all Altman would have to worry about if the case goes to trial. Musk's lawyers intend to paint Altman as someone who will do whatever it takes to get what he wants, including using every manner of deceit and concealment. And these allegations would not be without very strong evidence.\n\nBefore The New York Times Co. v. Microsoft Corp., et al suit began, anticipating that some evidence could be used against him, Altman is believed to have pre-emptively destroyed it. Technically this is called Spoilation, and it carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. But whether he gets charged with that is not the point.\n\nMusk's lawyers will call to the stand Ilya Sutskover and other members of the OpenAI board of directors who in 2023 fired Altman for not being \n\"consistently candid in his communications.\" They will use this damning evidence to show that Altman also used deceit and/or concealment to persuade the California Attorney General to allow OpenAI to convert from a nonprofit to a for-profit corporation. If evidence from this trial leads to Altman being prosecuted and convicted at the state and federal level for this Perjury and Grand Theft by False Pretenses, he would face 8 to 13 years in prison. \n\nBut it doesn't stop there. In November of 2023 Altman appointed Larry Summers to the board of directors of OpenAI. However, after Summers was exposed as being in the Epstein files, he was forced to resign from that role. Whether Altman knew or not is somewhat inconsequential because the public would, especially in light of the Annie Altman lawsuit, strongly suspect that he knew all about Summers' sordid history, but just didn't care. \n\nAnd we can be sure that Musk's lawyers have much more damning evidence against Altman that would come out in the trial.\n\nAt present, I would guess that less than 1% of the global population is aware of those above facts. The upcoming Musk v. OpenAI et al. trial would change all that. The 1995 OJ Simpson trial attracted 150 million American viewers. The Musk v. OpenAI et al. trial is expected to attract over a billion viewers from all over the world. And it would be all over the Internet for weeks.\n\nIf Altman chooses to, relatively soon, settle the case out of court, that \"in the know\" population would probably remain at less than 1%. However, if he lets the suit go to trial, not only will his personal reputation, and that of his family, be irreparably damaged, the reputation of OpenAI will probably also suffer the same degree of public condemnation. Think about it. How many consumers and enterprises would trust increasingly intelligent AIs developed by an evidently extremely deceitful, and perhaps psychopathic, CEO who may have, in fact, sexually abused his 10-year younger sister? As the saying on Wall Street goes, \"emotions are facts,\" and the public sentiment against Altman and OpenAI would probably be that of strong disgust and distrust.\n\nAltman has a big decision ahead of him. If he asks his lawyers their opinion, they will probably advise him to go to trial. But then again, they're not the ones who could be thrown from the frying pan into the fire. I hope he decides to settle out of court for his sake, for his family's sake, and for the sake of OpenAI. Once he does this he may no longer be the CEO, and OpenAI may no longer be a for-profit corporation, and a lot of money may have to be given back, but Altman will probably have spared himself a fate one wouldn't wish on one's worst enemy. I truly hope he decides wisely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "I think you connected a lot of dots just for the sake of it..\n\n>T**he Annie Altman lawsuit is real**—filed January 7-8, 2025, accusing Sam Altman of sexual abuse from 1997-2006, beginning when she was three. Sam Altman and his family emphatically deny the allegations, citing Ann's mental health struggles and their ongoing financial support. This is a civil suit seeking damages, not a criminal prosecution. The text's claim that it \"may induce Altman to settle the upcoming Musk v. OpenAI et al. suit\" is pure fantasy—there's zero logical or legal connection between a personal family matter and a corporate governance dispute. No credible source suggests these cases influence each other.\n\n>**The Musk v. OpenAI trial date is wrong in the text**—it states March 30 (presumably 2025) when the actual trial is scheduled for March 30, 2026. The lawsuit is genuinely proceeding, with Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers allowing fraud and unjust enrichment claims to move forward while dismissing breach of contract. But claims about \"spoilation\" carrying a \"maximum penalty of 20 years in prison\" misrepresent what actually happened. The New York Times lawsuit incident involved OpenAI accidentally deleting search data stored on its servers during discovery—an error the company called unintentional and recoverable, not Altman personally \"pre-emptively destroying evidence.\" No charges have been filed, and the 20-year penalty under Sarbanes-Oxley applies only to federal investigations, not civil discovery mishaps.\n\n>**The Ilya Sutskever testimony claims are distorted**. Sutskever did give a deposition in Musk's lawsuit and wrote a 52-page memo accusing Altman of \"lying\" and \"undermining executives,\" which will likely be used as evidence. However, the text presents this as definitive proof of criminal deceit, when it's actually one board member's allegations from a chaotic corporate coup—allegations Sutskever himself partially walked back, admitting much came secondhand from CTO Mira Murati.\n\n>**The Larry Summers/Epstein connection is real but mischaracterized**. Summers joined the OpenAI board in November 2023 and resigned in November 2025 after House Republicans released his emails with Epstein. But the text's insinuation that Altman \"knew all about Summers' sordid history\" is speculative. Summers' ties were publicly known, and his resignation suggests the board was unaware of the email contents.\n\n>**Most seriously, the text invents criminal liability wholesale**. Claims about Altman facing \"8 to 13 years in prison\" for perjury and grand theft related to the California AG's conversion approval have no basis in any reporting. The California Attorney General declined to intervene in OpenAI's restructuring, but that's not evidence of criminal conduct. Similarly, the text's viewership predictions (\"over a billion viewers\") and its concluding personal appeal (\"I hope he decides to settle\") are unqualified speculation.\n\n>The entire piece appears designed to pressure Altman into settling Musk's lawsuit by creating a false narrative that his sister's lawsuit creates leverage. It's a mashup of: verifiable facts (lawsuits exist), exaggerated risks (criminal penalties), unrelated events (Summers/Epstein), and pure imagination (the 1% aware figure, billion-viewer trial, settlement causation). The legal analysis is fundamentally flawed—personal scandal doesn't create settlement pressure in unrelated corporate litigation, and no credible attorney would advise settling based on this logic.",

I'm a random guy on the internet that saw this benchmark 5 days ago, a random benchmark that is certainly sensitive to the system prompt. But to the benchmark credit, everything is explained in the methodology section, of course the model is going to show multiple points of view when you prompt it in free text. Those benchmarks have a very fixed format so it can be automated. If you want to fight with someone about this, it's not with me, it's with the person that posted it and they will certainly be happy to give you the logs so you can check by yourself",

      "text": "I have been using deepseek V3.2 very much lately for my coding tasks, mostly python and automation scripts. This is very good for reasoning like cruashed heavy math code and multi step planing, way better than older open models, often on par with claude sonnet without the api costs. \n\nBut, the limitations are starting to bite. First off, inference is slooow even quantized (q4 on my 3090 takes forever for longer prompts), this kills iteration time on big codebass. Secondly, outputs get super verbose like it'll explain every little thing in rhe code response adding unnecessary comments or steps that I have tro trim manually, specially in agentic loops where I just want concise fixes, sometimes gets annoying..\n\nFacing this right now in a workflow whether its generation or editing bash scripts for data pipelines the verbosity makes the code bloated and hard to debug, and the slowness means waiting 30+ specs per turn. Anyone know tweaks to make it faster like better quants or vllm flags? pr like less wordy prompt engineering tricks??\n\nAlso head V4 is dropping soon with supposed speed ups and tighter outputs, so super eager to test that in my setup",

Zero token will revert its parameter to default but you can calibrate it again base on the parameters you want it to have. Regarding its speed on data mapping, precision of input allows it to speed up its response. This is what I observe in my last chat.",

And it isn’t related to the length of the chat, it can be even brand new stories and new chats that I start.\n\nAnyway, I am just curious if anyone knows why this happen? I’m not too savvy on AI stuff.. is it back end stuff happening? updates? or what? Any light shed would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance!\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/nzyyn4qvfqcg1.gif\n\n",

      "text": "Over the past year, web search has gone from a nice add-on to something we increasingly treat as core infrastructure when building AI features.\n\nAs more of our internal tools and products started relying on LLMs, the limitations became obvious pretty quickly. Models are fine for reasoning, but anything involving current events, recent research, pricing or market changes falls apart unless there’s a live data source behind them.\n\nAt the same time, the search options we used to rely on aren’t really there anymore. Google still doesn’t offer an open, general-purpose web search API that works well for SaaS or AI use cases. Bing Search API, which many teams leaned on for years, has now been retired in favor of Azure-tied solutions. That pushed us to look more closely at what else is out there.\n\nI spent some time digging into newer web search APIs that are designed for AI Agents and RAG-style workflows. A few things stood out to me:\n\n* Retrieval quality matters more than model choice in many RAG setups\n* Adding a retrieval step before generation dramatically improves factual accuracy\n* General consumer search performs surprisingly poorly when used directly inside AI pipelines\n* Freshness and latency start to matter a lot once you’re building agents or multi-step systems\n\nThere are now several tools focusing on this space (Tavily, Exa, Valyu, Perplexity’s Search API, Parallel, Linkup, etc.), each with different tradeoffs around speed, depth, freshness, and structure. Benchmarks like SimpleQA and FreshQA aren’t perfect, but they do show a consistent pattern: AI-first search APIs tend to outperform general web search, mainly on time-sensitive queries.\n\nThe big takeaway for me is that most AI systems are becoming hybrid by default. LLMs handle reasoning and synthesis, while web search supplies fresh, verifiable facts. Without that retrieval layer, reliability hits a ceiling pretty fast.\n\nI have covered everything in more details [here](https://mranand.substack.com/p/why-web-search-apis-are-becoming)",

If your search layer is noisy or slow, no fancy LLM will save you. I’d love to see more folks publishing retrieval metrics (FreshQA, domain-specific evals, latency histos) as first‑class, not just “we use Tavily/Perplexity” as a footnote.\n\n\n\nOne trick that’s worked well for me: separate “broad web” search (Tavily/Exa) from “deep vertical” search (e.g., your own RAG stack + something like SerpAPI or Valyu) and pick dynamically based on query type. Also worth logging which source was actually used in the final answer so you can tune over time.\n\n\n\nOn the tooling side, I’ve tried SerpAPI and Perplexity’s Search API; Pulse plus keyword alerts and Parallel-style APIs make it way easier to route only the high‑value, time‑sensitive queries through web search.\n\n\n\nBottom line: eval your retrieval stack like you eval your models, or you’ll cap your whole system.",
