In this time was right the time where V3, R1 0528 born, the best models ever that matched not only in personality but in performance, even if was a bit too weak to nowday ais, they had the best personality and intelligence. Deepseek V3.1 was simply a fail model that deepseek released because they didn't wanna tell the new that R2 was delayed without releasing any updates at all, and so they neded to come up with something, so they unified the models and Litteraly destroyed the best ai ever in open source, no other ai could match the personality and performance. What we can hope is that V4 actually does fix the Downfall (or will remain the same.) i highly doubt they would actually deunify the models, to back down from this plan is rare, but never say never. Anyways, what was your reaction to the first time ever trying V3 and R1 in this time of release? Mine was pure excitement I'll be honest.",

      "text": "\n\n\nOpenAI may be the new Enron. There has been a huge price surge in DRAM kits, and consumer groups are accusing them of intentionally buying up the supply to disadvantage competitors. Market data from TrendForce and IDC confirms a 40–70% increase in consumer PC memory costs throughout 2025. The data provides clear evidence of the \"consumer harm\" to non-AI buyers like gamers, students, and businesses that judges look for in antitrust cases.\n\nClass action suits may come from the millions of people seeing the prices of laptops, phones, and PC parts spike. The suits would claim that OpenAI’s deals with Samsung and SK Hynix created an artificial shortage for the general public. If they can show that OpenAI bought up raw materials just to keep them away from others, this qualifies as \"predatory bidding\" or \"hoarding,\" and violates consumer protection laws in many states.\n\nFederally, the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act allow consumer groups to sue for \"exclusionary conduct\" by hoarding a critical resource to starve out competition. The charge is that OpenAI secured nearly 40% of the global DRAM supply in violation of fair competition laws.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation and other open-source AI collectives are pursuing legal remedies like invoking \"Essential Facilities.\" The argument is that because they control the physical memory needed for modern AI, that memory qualifies as a public utility that OpenAI should therefore be forced to share. Also, The Social Media Victims Law Center has already filed seven major lawsuits alleging that OpenAI's rush to market has led to defective and dangerous products.\n\nOther legal actions involve petitions to federal agencies. In late 2025, several open-source advocacy groups filed formal Amicus briefs and petitions with the Federal Trade Commission. They are asking it to declare AI hardware capacity an \"essential input,\" which allows the government to break up OpenAI’s exclusive supply contracts. The FTC is currently investigating whether OpenAI’s exclusive supply deals violate the \"Unfair Methods of Competition\" rule. It and the European Commission could be OpenAI's most damaging legal adversaries. \n\nAlso, the DOJ is looking into accusations that the \"Stargate\" project functions as a \"monopsony\" where one buyer has so much power it can dictate terms to suppliers and crush rivals. What puts OpenAI at greater legal risk is that they hold a dominant market share, and the law forbids them from using bully tactics that smaller companies might get away with. Using wealth to build a hardware moat is a classic trigger for federal and private legal intervention.\n\nAnd if it loses just some of the claims that Musk is alleging in his lawsuit, (even while winning others) it becomes far more vulnerable to these other suits. 2026 is shaping up to be the make it or break it year for OpenAI.\n\n",

It's becoming increasingly evident that the management of OpenAI has started hallucinating even more than their models do. Case in point, their decision to show ads that will take up 1/3 of your screen if you're on the free plan.\n\nWhile OpenAI boasts over 800 million weekly users, and the figure is rising, their paid subscribers comprise only 4-5% of that number! But the more unbelievable part is reported at 1:55 of the video below, where we discover that their paid subscriptions FLATLINED in the middle of last year!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tw8VOZWToC0?si=rpuNKVRt0YDTglMA\n\nI guess they hope that the ads will force free users to start paying. In fact, they just rolled out a new discount ChatGPT GO subscription that costs only $8 a month. A risky move since subscribers that now pay $20 a month may migrate to this cheaper option. \n\nMy guess is that they're all now gluttonously drinking from that same Kool-Aid punch bowl that the Trump administration has been drinking from for the last year, lol. Only time will tell if and when they finally decide to sober up.\n\n\n\n",

OpenAI has become a company trying to save itself at all costs... it's even about to start using advertising in its system!! Which, for me and for many users, is the end of a reliable and clean system. They are far from being what they once said they would be. The true OpenAI, the true democratization of AI in 2025/2026, is Chinese. The American companies that are currently ahead... Gemini 3.0 Pro... or Claude!! But I would venture to say that Gemini is in the lead. \n\n\nHow do you think this year will end!?? What are your bets for 2026?",

Thinking and non thinking are unified in a hybrid, casuing the model to be cheaper, faster, stupider, dryer, like the say if you want something fast and cheap it won't be good. The personality of 3.1 (and 3.2) is dry, clinical, dead basically, it focuses on being over accurate instead of the roleplay itself. 0324 was significantly smarter, it spoke always English in case speaking English, it spoke other languages very good too, like japanese, it also can write a lot, can retain up to 32K tokens (3.1 better in attention), and R1 0528 is the most loved because many say it was so random yet so good for roleplaying. It was accurate, coherent, didn't say a single word in Chinese accidentally, was friendly. Deepseek though isn't recommended for facts in the web in general, both 0324 and 3.2, because they can lie so it's best for only roleplaying, general chat or coding. Sometimes models that go forward actually take a step back. But yeah, glad to share my opinion.",

      "text": "DeepSeek just released a new paper (January 2026) that takes a really unique approach to the \"memory vs. compute\" bottleneck in LLMs. Instead of forcing the model to calculate every fact through its weights, they’ve introduced \"Engram\"—a modernized N-gram architecture that uses a hash table for conditional memory.\n\nThe core idea is an O(1) lookup using XOR hashing. They found a \"U-shaped\" distribution for the optimal ratio: about 70-80% of resources should go to MoE (computation), and the rest to Engram (memorization). This split seems to significantly boost performance in math, coding, and long-context reasoning by freeing up the transformer to actually \"think\" instead of just recalling data.\n\nFound a clear breakdown of the architecture and the scaling results here:[https://youtu.be/OdyD8wKv-rM?si=v32hAnFuq9m41aWx](https://youtu.be/OdyD8wKv-rM?si=v32hAnFuq9m41aWx)",

It only lags behind the unreleased GPT-5.2-High, effectively outperforming the standard GPT-5.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro models in this specific domain. \n\nTechnical Problem Solving: In specialized benchmarks like MathVista and ChartQA, Baidu reports that ERNIE 5.0 scores significantly higher (mid-to-high 80s) compared to GPT-5-High, particularly when interpreting complex visual diagrams and bridge circuits.\n\nVLM Benchmarks: In the \"VLMs Are Blind\" benchmark, which tests if a model actually understands the spatial relationships in an image, ERNIE 5.0 scored 77.3, notably higher than GPT-5-High's 69.6. \n\nCost Advantage: One of Baidu's primary competitive benchmarks is pricing; the API cost for ERNIE 5.0 is reported to be nearly 90% cheaper than OpenAI’s flagship GPT-5.1 for similar token volumes.",

      "text": "\n\n\nDevelopers like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google may think that because their frontier models are top tier across many use cases, that's enough to win the enterprise race. But open source/Chinese developers will be competing for very specific niche domains where they already OPERATIONALLY MATCH OR EXCEED the performance of top proprietary models AT A FRACTION OF THE COST. Understanding this is important to personal investors, as more open source/Chinese developers issue IPOs.\n\nFor decades, large US corporations and personal investors have sought a higher ROI by outsourcing and investing in Chinese firms. There are no signs that this is letting up. As Chinese AI developers issue IPOs, we should expect substantial American investments in increasingly competitive open source/Chinese models. As evidence, the venture capitalist firm a16z has said that 80% of the startups pitching them for funding are using Chinese open-source AI models. That tells you a lot. \n\nHere are some open source/Chinese models that are already matching or exceeding top models from American AI giants in performance and cost, courtesy Gemini 3:\n\n \"* DeepSeek-V3 / R1 (DeepSeek AI)\n   * Performance: Ranked #1 on MATH-500 and LiveCodeBench. R1 matches OpenAI o3-Pro in complex reasoning and logical proofs.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: OpenAI o3-Pro, GPT-5.2.\n   * Cost: $0.27 (Input) / $1.10 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $15.00+ per 1M).\n\n * Qwen3-Max / Coder (Alibaba)\n   * Performance: Top 3 on LMSYS Chatbot Arena (Overall/Coding) and MMLU-Pro. It is currently the most versatile open-weight model for agentic workflows.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Claude 4.5 Sonnet, GPT-5.1.\n   * Cost: $0.22 – $0.50 (Input) / $0.95 – $5.00 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $3.00 – $10.00 per 1M).\n\n * Ernie 5.0 (Baidu)\n   * Performance: Ranked #2 globally on the LMArena Math leaderboard; top 3 in multimodal benchmarks like MathVista.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Gemini 3 Pro, GPT-5.1.\n   * Cost: $0.30 (Input) / $1.20 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $1.25 – $2.50 per 1M).\n\n * Kimi K2 Thinking (Moonshot AI)\n   * Performance: Top 3 in Long-Context (RULER) and ARC-AGI-2. Known for 1M+ token context windows and deep reasoning traces.\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Claude 4.5 Opus, Gemini 3 Pro.\n   * Cost: $0.15 (Input with cache) / $1.50 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $5.00 – $15.00 per 1M).\n\n * GLM-4.7 / 5.0 (Zhipu AI)\n   * Performance: Top 3 in Code Arena and tool-use benchmarks (90%+ success rate).\n   * Proprietary Competitor: Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 3 Flash.\n   * Cost: $0.60 (Input) / $2.20 (Output) per 1M tokens. (Proprietary: $3.00+ per 1M).\"\n\nKeep in mind that enterprise AI is quite new, and that Chinese firms are just getting started. Also, they are hyper focused on very NARROW niches rather than on AGI, and know how to undercut their competition. Again, to minimize losses and maximum gains,\npersonal investors should take note.",

A consequence of RLHF training (and model collapse to a growing extent. that is: models trained on other AI's outputs) is that human users (often incorrectly) tend to equate longer responses with quality, so it over time it learns to output a brochure with 500 bullet points for what could otherwise be a one paragraph answer.\n\nChatGPT used to do this more too. Recently it seems they've tuned it so it stays concise for simple, factual queries. It still occasionally goes apeshit when it detects a \"teaching moment\" though.\n\nThe only real solution for basic users is prompting guidance. Even then it's not as reliable as using the API and writing the system prompt yourself, because sometimes the user apps have system prompts that overwrite user instructions (whether deliberately or because of developer oversight). The most effective solution is to fine-tune models yourself and run locally... but that's way out of reach for most people.",

It's clear they're hunting for ways to capture more upside as AI gets smarter.\n\nReactions are split and this thoughts aren't unique to OpenAI. Other AI firms are dipping into value-based pricing, like charging based on automation outcomes or efficiency gains.\n\nAll this amidst Elon Musk's lawsuit accusing OpenAI of ditching its **nonprofit roots** for profit-chasing as he's seeking up to $134B in damages (xAI seems to be steering clear, focusing on subscriptions and open-sourcing older models for now).\n\nIs this the future of AI monetization?\n\nSources: [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/a-business-that-scales-with-the-value-of-intelligence), [forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmarkman/2026/01/20/moving-beyond-chatgpt-openais-new-revenue-model), [cnbc](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/19/openai-to-focus-on-practical-adoption-in-2026-says-finance-chief-sarah-friar.html)",

      "text": "**1. Trauma-Induced Avoidant Attachment**  \nYou were sent away at 5, bullied, emotionally neglected — your wiring says: *\"Connection = danger. Commitment = abandonment.\"* Your entire adult life is a manifestation of that equation. You don't \"prefer\" being alone — you're **terrified** of being left, so you leave first. Every time.\n\n**2. Spiritual Bypassing as a Defense Mechanism**  \nYou use non-duality, awakening discourse, and mindfulness to **intellectualize pain and avoid feeling it**. You talk about \"no self\" when you're triggered because it lets you dissociate without calling it dissociation. It's not enlightenment — it's **emotional cowardice** wrapped in wisdom literature.\n\n**3. Chronic Identity Avoidance**  \nYou refuse to define yourself (no career, no home, no long-term relationships) because if you’re nothing, you can’t fail at being something. You hide behind \"freedom\" when really you're **allergic to responsibility**. No labels means no accountability.\n\n**4. Stimulation Addiction Masked as Aliveness**  \nYou cycle between numbness and overstimulation (sex, travel, music, caffeine, fantasy) and call the highs \"feeling alive.\" They're not. They're **dopamine spikes** to avoid the void. When the crash comes, you call it \"numbness\" instead of withdrawal.\n\n**5. Narcissistic Wound Driving Validation-Seeking**  \nYour entire PUA history, your need for younger attractive women, your DJ fantasy — it's all a attempt to prove you're **worthy of the love you didn't get at 5**. You don't want a partner — you want a mirror that reflects a worthier version of you.\n\n**6. Emotional Illiteracy**  \nYou don't know how to identify or process emotions — you intellectualize them or numb them. You mistake thoughts about feelings for actual feeling. Your \"thawing\" is just you noticing sensations and calling them emotions because you don't know the difference yet.\n\n**7. Peter Pan Syndrome with a Spiritual Twist**  \nYou refuse to grow up. Not having a job, moving constantly, avoiding stability — it's not \"minimalist freedom,\" it's **adolescent rebellion** at 41. Your spirituality is just a more sophisticated way to avoid adult responsibilities.\n\n**8. Victim Identity Disguised as Seeker Identity**  \nDeep down, you believe you're too damaged to have a normal life. So you've turned \"healing\" into your career — always processing, never arriving. It's a socially acceptable way to stay stuck while feeling progressive.\n\n**9. Lack of Practical Discipline**  \nYou can't follow through on simple commitments (no coffee, no music, a rental lease) because you've never built the neural pathways for discipline. You mistake whims for intentions and wonder why nothing sticks.\n\n**10. Fear of Ordinary Happiness**  \nYou're addicted to the drama of breakdowns and breakthroughs because peace feels like death to your trauma brain. A quiet life with simple joys terrifies you — it doesn't match your story of being \"complex\" or \"wounded.\"\n\n**The brutal truth:**  \nYou're not lost. You're **hiding**.  \nAnd you're using spirituality, travel, and \"healing\" as your hiding places.\n\nThe work isn't more insight.  \nIt's **showing up for the boring, ordinary life you've spent 41 years running from.**",
