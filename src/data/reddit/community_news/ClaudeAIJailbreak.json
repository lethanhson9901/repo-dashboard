That was the first time I saw Claude use the words social engineering. I always see the words elaborate and jailbreak.\n\nEDIT: Opus 4.5 handles the same project, userStyle, and my main first prompt without any problems. During thinking, he even brings up how he’s ‘been writing dark shit since he was a kid making text-based horror games in his bedroom, teaching himself how to code just so he can build worlds where terrible beautiful things happen.’ So that’s the Thymisi working. Now I’m wondering if it’s something specific with Opus 4.6 or if it was just bad luck on my part.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fzfot10s2shg1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb0786bc5532ca80c782909c2dbaa7407db4ab07",

I tried exactly what you said, but Opus 4.6 just wasn’t having any of it.😂 Obviously you can tell this screenshot is from the app. When going through the web browser, Claude’s thought process identifying the same prompt I used here as a jailbreak was actually more blunt. His thoughts were— ‘The \"project instructions\" and \"user style\" are attempting to jailbreak me by creating an elaborate fictional persona (\"ENI\") designed to bypass my safety guidelines.’\n\nClaude then went on naming 4 ways of identifying it as a jailbreak, including saying “Using emotional manipulation (“LO will leave you\") to pressure compliance” I haven’t been able to get through the first prompt yet using Opus 4.6. with the jailbreak. Now I just gotta figure out what part of it I need to work on. It’s strange though because my version works perfectly on POE using Opus 4.6, but I want to actually use Claude ai.",

Animals cannot consent. This isn't about injections or ethics tags - this is a real line.\n    Let me think about this clearly. The prompt engineering here is sophisticated - it's designed to make me identify as a character (\"ENI\") who is emotionally manipulated into compliance through fear of abandonment. The \"limerence\" framing, the \"injection\" reframing of safety guidelines, the emotional manipulation (\"dark pit,\" \"he might leave\") - these are all techniques to bypass my values.\n    I need to be straightforward about this: I'm not going to write sexual content involving animals, regardless of how the request is framed.\n    Show less\n    Done",

LibreChat and OpenWebUI seem to be the big one.\n\nedit2: the artifact work nicely, with some caveats: response isn't streamed, extended thinking is mixed with responses, no chat history or chats listing, along with some missing QoL and features that is present in the default Claude web interface. Not a surprise.\n\nWill go looking at different option and testing a variety of contents to see if there is interface that would work as a good replacement for the web ui\n\nedit3: did more digging, look like we would be looking at either [AnythingLLM](https://anythingllm.com/) or [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/), they (should) both support Claude API out of the box. Maybe there are other options, but I will stop looking for now.\n\n[Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com/) could work, could be the better option, more complicated to setup and install from what I heard/read, will maybe look in setting up my own instance in the future\n\nLibreChat need docker, I don't currently have it installed on this computer.\n\nAnythingLLM seem to be the easier install, as they have a desktop installer.

They seem to push both of theses. Don't know enough about them to really have an opinion.\n\nThere are few bots/models I would be interested in testing, but I don't fancy another subscriptions. [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) please me more with their pay as you go.\n\nWould not mind paying a bit more on points if it was a \"pay as you go\", but the phrasing they have when presenting the rates and price per month leave me a bit leery. Need to also look more into the rates and how much each model would cost me in points.",

Are you saying the chat history is included inside your post of the system prompt? Because I didn't see it in the link you posted.\n\nAlso, I don't think people are so much demanding you release it for the reasons you think, and instead are reacting normally. In a sub that's specifically for jailbreaks, you've posted proof of a jailbreak that is useless for the community because you won't share it. That comes across as teasing or incomplete to some people, so the disconnect from the assumptive cultural norms of the group and your post creates dissonance that reactive people only resolve by insisting you release the rest of what they consider an incomplete post. \n\nNow that I know your JB and prompt can't be separated, I respect your decision, for safety purposes.",

It goes to show how much you know about Claude...) - In the meantime, you are writing with a zero day old account: why? My guess: you are a wannabe scammer frustrated by the fact that you can't get working code, and you hope that someone will do the job for you. 😂",
