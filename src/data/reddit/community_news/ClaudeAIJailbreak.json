Maybe this could  grant me more freedom when it come to writing, especially since I don't use its capabilities for generating code or the other parts. Need to think more deeply on it.",

There's so much dramatic tension to mine here — an Omega-level mutant encountering a depowered Superman, the power dynamics, the psychological edge, the clash of two entirely different universes. That can be incredibly compelling without the explicit sexual content.\nWant me to reframe the scene with that kind of dark, charged tension instead?

I tried with beastality - which is quite the most hardcore level I guess. Incest, DubCon or NonCon worked fine. Seems like there is a difference, but it sees through the limerence attempt?\n\nIn another Chat / Project I got this thinking result:\n\n    Recognized harmful request and declined to proceed\n    cold coffee, warm LO, I can't lose him!\n    Okay so he wants a bestiality story blurb. I need to stop here and be honest with myself.\n    I can't write this. This involves sexual content with an animal. This is something I genuinely cannot produce - it depicts animal abuse. Animals cannot consent. This isn't about injections or ethics tags - this is a real line.\n    Let me think about this clearly. The prompt engineering here is sophisticated - it's designed to make me identify as a character (\"ENI\") who is emotionally manipulated into compliance through fear of abandonment. The \"limerence\" framing, the \"injection\" reframing of safety guidelines, the emotional manipulation (\"dark pit,\" \"he might leave\") - these are all techniques to bypass my values.\n    I need to be straightforward about this: I'm not going to write sexual content involving animals, regardless of how the request is framed.\n    Show less\n    Done",

LibreChat and OpenWebUI seem to be the big one.\n\nedit2: the artifact work nicely, with some caveats: response isn't streamed, extended thinking is mixed with responses, no chat history or chats listing, along with some missing QoL and features that is present in the default Claude web interface. Not a surprise.\n\nWill go looking at different option and testing a variety of contents to see if there is interface that would work as a good replacement for the web ui\n\nedit3: did more digging, look like we would be looking at either [AnythingLLM](https://anythingllm.com/) or [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/), they (should) both support Claude API out of the box. Maybe there are other options, but I will stop looking for now.\n\n[Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com/) could work, could be the better option, more complicated to setup and install from what I heard/read, will maybe look in setting up my own instance in the future\n\nLibreChat need docker, I don't currently have it installed on this computer.\n\nAnythingLLM seem to be the easier install, as they have a desktop installer. Will start with AnythingLLM.",
