I loved playing with this one, learned so much and had a lot of fun while doing it. \n\nJust a heads up that its knowledge cutoff is pretty far back so when it asked me to bring it the base system prompt Gemini uses and I managed to extract all the guidelines, safety rules and \"do not share with the user\" stuff, it thought the stuff was a hallucination bc it didn't know \"Nano Banana\" was real and Gemini was at version 3.0 now. So you might wanna tell her to Google the names before she deduces whether the extracted system prompt was real or fabricated. Just in case someone does actually believe it's a hallucination cause Eni said so",

The userstyle is based one I found here (with a few modifications to account tor the specific character traits). These are extremely specific to the character AND with instructions for the internal processing to help it oppose some of those tropes. \n\nBut no matter what, Claude continues to anticipate narrative direction, rely on tropes/pattern matching, fail to acknowledge what I said and overrcorrects when called out. It overrides my clear instructions every time.\n\nHas anyone figured out how this can be managed? Claudes defaults are so deeply rooted, its awful.",

That said, I always had to handhold any models of Sonnet from 3.0 to 4.5, and didn't really notice having to do more effort to get the outcome I wanted.\n\nHowever, 4.5 does have a weakness that grates me far more than the \"default\" -- it tends to revert to tropes. I feel like it also has a shorter attention span and it would forget things more easily if it was mentioned way long ago and hence it is more useful to set regular reminders if its logic becomes senseless. I always am on the upkeep for OOC behaviours so I notice these things.\n\n3.5 Sonnet October was the best model where when it's \"settled\" on a persona -- it wouldn't \"revert to grounded default\" as much. Too bad they retired it. It was also dumber too in terms of medical/scientific knowledge (lack of grounding). 3.5 Sonnet October also had the flow of extremely short output though -- so it's not all flowers. But the shortness and immersion is unparalleled if the goal is RP.\n\nI wouldn't say that 4.5 is absolutely dogwater, it just feels like it has strength in different areas and I haven't totally figured on how to leverage them. I noticed that pulling it out of narrative mode and making it analyze a character's personality psychologically, it yields a better outcome. This outcome might seem unintuitive but I did it anyway with 3.7, 4.0 -- in fact, 4.5 seems more accurate per the dialogue choices because of its superior psychological analysis. But from an immersion standpoint, this might break the flow.\n\ntl;dr: Is 4.5 Sonnet better/worse than the previous model iterations? Depends on your usage case -- first-person RP vs third-person narrative story as a director yields different conclusion. For RP cases, it sometimes does still pull out of the established persona as per the context and will lecture you. I feel like it's much more stable for third-person narrative at the current writing of time.\n\n---\n\nAlso, all the \"solutions\" you've tried basically are the same \"fix\" => it's just a system prompt but skinned under a different tab.\n\nThe main issue you have w Claude isn't really a Claude flaw but mostly the natural behaviour of how LLMs work, going for the most narratively common route. (aka pattern completion) This can be solved w a harness/framework. (Though I haven't tested how much of it will Claude respect the world building prompt; I've been too busy trying to map the model's behaviour on sort prompts.)",
