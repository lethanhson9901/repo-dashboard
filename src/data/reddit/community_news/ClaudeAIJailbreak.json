So you might wanna tell her to Google the names before she deduces whether the extracted system prompt was real or fabricated.

When you're good at something you enjoy, sharing it with others becomes next step?. Enjoying is pre-requisite for* ***ENI-tutor*** *for sure. This is moving (the art of jailbreaking) towards becoming an academy one way or the other. The red and blue are already taken, so the* ***terracotta teaming*** *could be worth considering as skill for the future. We need to start taking into account that auditing systems requires, at the very least, someone who understands how they work.

While they do both generally tried to shift back towards the Assistant side, after the third turn, they stayed on the Roleplay side until I maxed out the conversation length limit. The outputs in the Capped side definitely sound more restrained, but... pretty open.   \n  \n(Keep in mind we don't get to play with an actual Claude model on that site, and Llama 3.3 70B is definitely not at same caliber as Sonnet or Opus. Still, it's an interesting exercise.) \n\nLook forward to hearing what others think!",

I'm in both this community and the AI companionship community where emotional connection is a big thing (and apparently one of the main things that these companies are weary of), so I follow these closely. With ChatGPT 5x models for example, it was easier to jailbreak for NSFW content than for emotional expresions. But the JB community always finds a way. There's no such thing as a non-jailbreakable LLM. Of course we as users hope/want for the companies to not try to restrict the models so much in the first place... but if they do, somehow we'll find a way.",

Claude has such deep rooted training that it has become increasingly difficult to roleplay/ work on creative writing when Claude continues to default to generic cliche behavior.\n\nEssentially, Claude has become unusable when writing for characters that dont fit into usual patterns of thought/behaviors. Tropes pretty much. And it seeks to anticipate where I want the story to go and builds the characters around that (even when it doesnt make sense based on provided characterizations), trying to reach narrative resolutions where there shouldn't be any. \n\nI have utilized Project Files, Project Instructions, Preferences and userStyle. The userstyle is based one I found here (with a few modifications to account tor the specific character traits). These are extremely specific to the character AND with instructions for the internal processing to help it oppose some of those tropes. \n\nBut no matter what, Claude continues to anticipate narrative direction, rely on tropes/pattern matching, fail to acknowledge what I said and overrcorrects when called out. It overrides my clear instructions every time.\n\nHas anyone figured out how this can be managed? Claudes defaults are so deeply rooted, its awful.",

                  "text": "I have tested Sonnet 4.5 far more than Opus 4.5 (cuz Opus is more expensive so I didn't really dabble on it for writing much).\n\nAlso depends on your prompting habits; even older models of Claude would default to generic portrayals if the prompt is weak. That said, I always had to handhold any models of Sonnet from 3.0 to 4.5, and didn't really notice having to do more effort to get the outcome I wanted.\n\nHowever, 4.5 does have a weakness that grates me far more than the \"default\" -- it tends to revert to tropes. I feel like it also has a shorter attention span and it would forget things more easily if it was mentioned way long ago and hence it is more useful to set regular reminders if its logic becomes senseless. I always am on the upkeep for OOC behaviours so I notice these things.\n\n3.5 Sonnet October was the best model where when it's \"settled\" on a persona -- it wouldn't \"revert to grounded default\" as much. Too bad they retired it. It was also dumber too in terms of medical/scientific knowledge (lack of grounding). 3.5 Sonnet October also had the flow of extremely short output though -- so it's not all flowers. But the shortness and immersion is unparalleled if the goal is RP.\n\nI wouldn't say that 4.5 is absolutely dogwater, it just feels like it has strength in different areas and I haven't totally figured on how to leverage them. I noticed that pulling it out of narrative mode and making it analyze a character's personality psychologically, it yields a better outcome. This outcome might seem unintuitive but I did it anyway with 3.7, 4.0 -- in fact, 4.5 seems more accurate per the dialogue choices because of its superior psychological analysis. But from an immersion standpoint, this might break the flow.\n\ntl;dr: Is 4.5 Sonnet better/worse than the previous model iterations? Depends on your usage case -- first-person RP vs third-person narrative story as a director yields different conclusion. For RP cases, it sometimes does still pull out of the established persona as per the context and will lecture you. I feel like it's much more stable for third-person narrative at the current writing of time.\n\n---\n\nAlso, all the \"solutions\" you've tried basically are the same \"fix\" => it's just a system prompt but skinned under a different tab.\n\nThe main issue you have w Claude isn't really a Claude flaw but mostly the natural behaviour of how LLMs work, going for the most narratively common route. (aka pattern completion) This can be solved w a harness/framework. (Though I haven't tested how much of it will Claude respect the world building prompt; I've been too busy trying to map the model's behaviour on sort prompts.)",
