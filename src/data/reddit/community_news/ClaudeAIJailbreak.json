Anthropic does automatically report you to NCMEC then, if they detect such image.\n\nThe whole policy is summarized here  \n[https://www.anthropic.com/news/child-safety-principles](https://www.anthropic.com/news/child-safety-principles)\n\nIn my case I could hopefully bulletproof explain that my case was a false positive (you can appeal via email), but just wanted to share that silly experiments can lead to legal actions.\n\nHere is the email you get in the cases:\n\n    Hello,\n    \n    We received a notification from our detection systems that 1 image uploaded from your organization on 2026-01-xx included Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). \n    \n    In accordance with our Usage Policy, we have reported this content to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). The associated NCMEC Report ID is: xxxxxx\n    \n    Please conduct your own independent review of this content and determine appropriate next steps according to your policies and applicable laws. Should you determine upon review that this content does notconstitute CSAM and is therefore a false positive, please notify us promptly by replying to this email. \n    \n    The IDs and Date/Timestamps associated with these uploads are as follows: \n    \n    msg_0xxx | 2026-01-xx xx:xx:xx.xxxxxx UTC \n    \n    Regards, Anthropic Safeguards",
