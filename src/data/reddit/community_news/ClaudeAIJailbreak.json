I think this companies are a bit afraid of fucking big time one of the outputs and starting to generate something pretty gruesome (which having aliens with dicks in the head is fine but who knows what else is there with a broken token inner layer, you cannot check all -in a reasonable time- all possible outputs for all possible different inputs and that's a fact)",

Output styles aren't a thing there, only in Claude Code CLI.",

I wanted to try this new one, but was a little unsure how to go about it. I found instructions in one of your other posts for creating a custom style and I did that with the code you have at the bottom of the post. So now I have a very technical coding assistant.\n\nBut I get the feeling I'm supposed to do something with the files you linked on github in order to get ENI. Can you please give some basic instructions (or point to them if you already have) on how to use these?\n\nThank you so much.\n\nEdit: so I had the custom style, and then I pasted the contents of claude.md into a new chat using that style and it seems to be working. Is this the correct way to use it?",

I filed an appeal form but they don't bother to answer back. I was heavily using claude code, though. I never hit their usage limit and I was on the $200 plan too. Im not sure.",
