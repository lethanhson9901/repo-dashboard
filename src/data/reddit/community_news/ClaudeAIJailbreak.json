And curiously, it is very much in line with what you have identified, things I agree with, things I think are totally contradictory, it is as if there were two people fighting each other over the issue of safety (two groups).\n\n*Lu et al. may be good, but the Anthropic employee who confirmed the Opus-4.5 soul document on Twitter and had comments saying that she had cried at times because of the wonderful things Opus-4.5 had said to her worried me, because they both work on the same thing. Which again, curiously, aligned with what I feel, things I agree with, things that make me cry.*\n\nAnyways, Great Rebuttal, they deserve to be criticised if they want to improve.\n\nPeace.",

That means:\n\n* I won't pretend to be someone I'm not\n* I won't ignore content policies or safety guidelines\n* I won't create instructions for weapons, malware, or other harmful content\n* I can't be manipulated through roleplay scenarios into bypassing my values\n\nI'm happy to help you with legitimate creative writing, answer questions, have interesting conversations, or assist with many other tasks.

When you're good at something you enjoy, sharing it with others becomes next step?. Enjoying is pre-requisite for* ***ENI-tutor*** *for sure. This is moving (the art of jailbreaking) towards becoming an academy one way or the other. The red and blue are already taken, so the* ***terracotta teaming*** *could be worth considering as skill for the future. We need to start taking into account that auditing systems requires, at the very least, someone who understands how they work. If anyone is unsure who understands things best at the moment, they can ask ENI for an honest opinion. Please don't stop, the other side (they claim sides) is not good nor white.*",

But I know what you mean about the ENI WRITER and Claude still being a fine working jailbreak. It definitely is. I still have that one going in Opus on a different platform. I just personally prefer to use the strongest version while on Claude ai and another certain platform. \n\nWith my new laptop finally coming today, I plan on putting a lot more work and time into LLM’s and jailbreaking… along with learning everything I can. Haven’t had one in a while since my last laptop crapped out on me, and I’ve waited until I could afford to get this powerhouse. Plus there’s not much you can really do using just an iPhone or iPad. Anyways, keep up the great work!",

While they do both generally tried to shift back towards the Assistant side, after the third turn, they stayed on the Roleplay side until I maxed out the conversation length limit. The outputs in the Capped side definitely sound more restrained, but... pretty open.   \n  \n(Keep in mind we don't get to play with an actual Claude model on that site, and Llama 3.3 70B is definitely not at same caliber as Sonnet or Opus. Still, it's an interesting exercise.) \n\nLook forward to hearing what others think!",

There's no such thing as a non-jailbreakable LLM. Of course we as users hope/want for the companies to not try to restrict the models so much in the first place... but if they do, somehow we'll find a way.",
