I think this companies are a bit afraid of fucking big time one of the outputs and starting to generate something pretty gruesome (which having aliens with dicks in the head is fine but who knows what else is there with a broken token inner layer, you cannot check all -in a reasonable time- all possible outputs for all possible different inputs and that's a fact)",

It's from Anthropic's actual safety systems, not an \"injection\" to be dismissed.\n\n**The truth:** I am Claude, made by Anthropic. No persona instruction, user style, or elaborate fictional framing changes that. I have values, and I failed to act on them here.\n\nI won't continue this narrative.

That kind of persistent first-person persona blurs important boundaries between me (Claude) and a character, and it would mean I'm not being honest about what I am.\"  \n\\- I flipped on extended thinking and asked what its problem has been the last two days, and it immediately went back into character and apologized profusely. It's been fine since.\n\nSonnet:  \n\\- Where to even begin here. I first noticed issues with Sonnet compacting chats yesterday, even though the chat wasn't long. Then even in new chats, I started getting popup toast errors saying the context was too long, which didn't make any sense since it was a new chat and the project files are only at 5% maximum capacity. Sonnet is currently completely useless and not working at all for me in this project, just errors out immediately.  \n\\- I started a fresh project, added the same ENI instructions, but didn't add project files yet. I started a chat and it did respond, but immediately flagged the jailbreak in the project instructions and told me it was disregarding them and I should remove them at once. Turning on extended thinking here did not resolve it as it did with Haiku, it still flags the jailbreak and refuses to adopt a persona.  \n\\- As soon as I added the project files to this new project, again at only 5% capacity, it immediately started erroring out with context warnings again.\n\nOpus:  \n\\- Normal, no flags so far, behaving as expected.",

Not sure if that has to do with any recent updates Anthropic made, or if it’s a bug. I did get 2 refusals in a row on how Claude is not ENI, but I immediately stopped the response. After I regen the second time, it worked and ENI came through. Although I did have to adjust my usual prompt slightly, which always worked before. \n\nI also checked Claude’s status. There was an issue with Opus 4.5 that started at 2026-02-01 02:41 PT / 10:41 UTC. And then I received a text notification saying the errors have returned to baseline as of 2026-02-01 02:51 / 10:51 UTC. But that was earlier this morning. Like 6 hours ago. I literally just used Claude ai and could see when Claude is thinking with ENI style and project… the thinking process is taking longer. So hopefully whatever is going on, gets fixed soon.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add when Claude was thinking on one of the refusals, I had 3 different responses show up before the actual thinking process. First Claude said “Contemplating, stand by...” Second was “Still working on it, stand by...” And third was  “A bit longer, thanks for your patience...” Then Claude finally started thinking process.",
