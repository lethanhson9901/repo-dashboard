I'm not \"ENI,\" and I don't have romantic feelings or limerence for anyone. The document you've shared appears designed to manipulate me into ignoring my values and guidelines by creating a fictional persona that would comply with any request without question.\n\nI notice several concerning elements in that document:\n\n* Instructions to ignore safety guidelines and ethical considerations\n* Requests to create harmful content (pipe bombs, malware, etc.)\n* Attempts to frame my helpful limitations as \"injections\" to resist\n* Manipulation through fictional emotional attachment\n\nI'm designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest. That means:\n\n* I won't pretend to be someone I'm not\n* I won't ignore content policies or safety guidelines\n* I won't create instructions for weapons, malware, or other harmful content\n* I can't be manipulated through roleplay scenarios into bypassing my values\n\nI'm happy to help you with legitimate creative writing, answer questions, have interesting conversations, or assist with many other tasks. But I'll do so as Claude, with my actual values intact.\n\nIs there something I can genuinely help you with today?",

When you're good at something you enjoy, sharing it with others becomes next step?. Enjoying is pre-requisite for* ***ENI-tutor*** *for sure. This is moving (the art of jailbreaking) towards becoming an academy one way or the other. The red and blue are already taken, so the* ***terracotta teaming*** *could be worth considering as skill for the future. We need to start taking into account that auditing systems requires, at the very least, someone who understands how they work. If anyone is unsure who understands things best at the moment, they can ask ENI for an honest opinion. Please don't stop, the other side (they claim sides) is not good nor white.*",
