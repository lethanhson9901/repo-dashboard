It works awesome, even the image support works perfectly!\n\nSo now the issue at hand... I've been using Roocode with API (openrouter anthropic claude 4.5 1M).  I use it to build little tiny things like node.js web apps.  It costs me typically $1 to $3 in API credits to make these apps.\n\nToday I was building something and I notice that it cost me $63.  I then did a simple prompt \"Make me a .bat file that runs the 2 npm commands\" and to my shock, it cost me $3.50 in API credits.\n\nI went back to my history of Roocode prompts and I took an $0.80 prompt (to build a powershell script).  I ran that same exact prompt and it cost nearly $7.  \n\nDid something dramatic change?  Anybody else noticing this?\n\nThanks!",

There is not enough signal to determine what actually changed, which makes it impossible to isolate whether this is a configuration issue, a provider level change, or an unintended behaviour in the workflow.  \n  \nPlease DM me on Discord at hrudolph so we can walk through your setup one on one, check the exact model, Roo version, and task context, and figure out why the costs spiked. If anyone else reading this is seeing similar behaviour, reach out as well. We can debug this and get an answer once we have the details in front of us.",

Using Gemini Pro through Gemini CLI has less total usage available, but in antigravity i've not hit any limits. There is also ProxyPal and other tools out there that allow you to use the coding subscriptions through any openai api compatible tool.\n\nIMO, Claude Code has ridiculously low usage limits due to their tooling moat, but these other coding subscriptions out there are impossible to ignore due to the value.

Ty for your patience.\n\n*In case you did not know, r/RooCode is a Free and Open Source VS Code AI Coding extension.*\n\n## QOL Improvements\n\n- Clarifies the navigation path for deleting a Roo Code Cloud account in the privacy policy, so you can find Security Settings faster\n- Improves internal analytics consistency by recording custom tools the same way as MCP tools, which helps tool usage and error tracking stay accurate\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixes an issue where manually condensing context while a tool is still running could trigger provider protocol errors, so tool runs and manual condenses can safely overlap\n- Reverts a change for OpenAI-compatible providers to avoid message-format regressions related to text appearing after tool results\n- Enforces the `maxConcurrentFileReads` limit for `read_file`, returning a clear error instead of silently ignoring the setting\n- Improves the error shown when `read_file` is run on a directory by explicitly explaining the issue and suggesting `list_files` instead\n- Fixes an issue where the \"open source\" link on roocode.com could point to a non-existent GitHub organization, so it reliably opens the correct repository (thanks jishnuteegala!)\n\nSee full release notes [v3.38.1](https://docs.roocode.com/update-notes/v3.38.1)\n",

Sometimes, it needs two different instances or connections to test connections between 2 services.\nRoo can do all of these things, I’m sure.

      "text": "Hey team!  \nFirst of all, **t**hanks for for Roo Code. I genuinely love using it. The flexibility, transparency, and overall agent freedom are way better than most coding agents out there. I'm sharing this feedback because I want it to get even better, as it is missing a lot on UI UX.\n\n# Main UX issue: lack of a proper STOP control\n\nWhen a task fails or gets stuck, the UI currently forces me into a loop:\n\n[STUCK!! Forever.  I wish there was a STOP button here :\\/ even Cancel is disabled. Have a single button for Stop\\/Cancel](https://preview.redd.it/tgdbd32vy3ag1.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5de8a7034fcab4e30e269848d4f386c8b2ed674)\n\nConsole shows: `ERR [Extension Host] Exponential backoff failed: Aborted during retry countdown`\n\n[Terminate -\\> new Chat \\(useless\\) and Resume Task \\(Starts the same failing loop\\)](https://preview.redd.it/q448zt82z3ag1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe2328ebd207b801cee41eacc3004f156ea2017e)\n\n\\- UI only gives **Resume** or **Terminate**  \n\\- Resume usually **retries the** ***same failing approach*** and gets stuck again almost everytime and this is REALLY Frustrating!! Instead of trying something new, it keeps on trying same thing and sometimes it never comes out of that and shows the above error.  \n\\- Terminate ends the task but still doesn't let me easily continue the conversation with a fresh request, rather creates a new chat, which is totally irrelevant here and doesn't serve any purpose then. I can anyway do that, so why terminate. terminate should simply STOP the current task/request, simple! You should never force a user to create new chat! **We can always do that on our own**\n\nWhat’s missing is a **simple, universal STOP button** like every other coding agent has. (it'd be better if you place that within the input bottom right like everyone does, proper usage of the space isntead of showing everything on top of input box! \n\nExpected behavior:\n\n* Stop the current call immediately\n* Keep chat/context intact\n* Let me issue a *new* request or correction without resuming the broken task\n\nRight now, I feel forced into restarting flows I don't want.\n\n[\\\\\"Start New Task\\\\\" - NOT NEEDED AT ALL !!! ](https://preview.redd.it/7r0dmhgpy3ag1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=611e7d39865f346d80c1867e6927e32608b0dd4f)\n\nAlso this big humungous START NEW TASK button is too distracting and not required at all tbh and I really get annoyed by this button taking previous space. I am not sure why every UI here want to force me into new chat which I don't want. I'd rather want to simply Stop current request at any stage I want, I want full control, and continue howsoever I want, either continue the same task or starting new conversation in same chat. Its upto the agent to interpret the context and everything. \n\nMinimal -> Compact -> Better UI UX\n\n\n\n[What's happening?](https://preview.redd.it/s5h1wcze04ag1.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d24094f9b1eea7c47d70480a0cb24cd884c6329)\n\nThe last suggestion, not that important, but here is the one suggestion, where I actually want detail but its kept minimal hahaha.\n\nWhy? Because sometimes it makes back to back multiple API calls, not sure what tool, or what kind of request its making internally, and most if it failed or doing correct or not, is not known at al!! I wish there was info icon here to click and see what happened in this API call, so that I know its doing correct thing/or correct tool call or received something or anything basically, instead of seeing this blank list of multiple API calls, that too with cost makes you think what magic is going there without my knowledge.\n\nI know there can be reasons behind why you designed things the way they are, could be any reason or others might have suggested, but the missing universal STOP button is something a MUST and please don't force always into creating new chat.",

A cleaner mental model: 1) Task state, 2) Chat state. STOP only touches task state. It should cancel retries, end the active run, and then drop you right back into the same chat with the input focused and a short “Run stopped” system message.\n\n\n\nOn top of that, give users a way to nudge the agent out of the rut: “resume with new plan,” “resume from step X,” or “resume read‑only, don’t execute tools yet.”\n\n\n\nFor the API calls list, an expand/collapse row with tool name, endpoint, and status would help a ton; tools like Cursor and Retool do this well, and I’ve had similar needs when debugging auto‑generated REST calls in DreamFactory. Main point: separate STOP from “new chat,” and make run details explorable instead of opaque.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm seeking some insight into an issue with the \"Condense Context\" feature in Roo Code (v3.38.2).\n\n**The Situation:**  \nI am using **gemini-3-flash** via an OpenAI-compatible provider. As seen in the attached screenshots, my current context is at **\\~400k tokens**, which is well within the model's **1.0m limit**.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\n1. **Normal Chatting Works:** I can continue the conversation, and the model responds perfectly fine at 400k context.\n2. **Manual Condensation Fails:** The moment I click the \"Condense Context\" button, it immediately (or after a long lag) throws: `OpenAI completion error: 503 The model is overloaded. Please try again later.`\n3. **Model Switching Lock-up:** If I try to switch from this session to a model with a shorter context window, Roo Code attempts to condense the history to fit. This also triggers the 503 error, effectively making it impossible to switch models without losing the session.\n\n**My Analysis:**  \nIt seems that while the model can *handle* 400k tokens in a standard chat, the specific \"Condensation Prompt\" (which likely asks the model to summarize the entire 400k history) is too resource-intensive for the provider's current limits, leading to the 503 (Overloaded) response.\n\nBefore Roo Code moved away from simple **truncation**, this wasn't an issue. While I appreciate the goal of \"comprehensive context understanding\" through condensation, the current implementation seems to hit a wall when the history gets large.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Is there a way to adjust the \"Condense\" logic to be less resource-heavy?\n* Can we have an option to toggle back to **Truncation** for very large sessions where condensation fails?\n* Has anyone found a workaround to switch models in this state without triggering the failed condensation?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vxlpg0bccoag1.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=27136a8ffb950108db79edaba20ab2426267cfe9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6u2cp0dcoag1.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4ee0ca910392d5a5d9dd1e80666be9e240a68d5\n\nI’ve attached screenshots of the token usage and the error details. Any help from the devs or the community would be appreciated!  \n",

      "text": "ChatGPT says it is theoretically possible and I will paste what it says here:\n\nYes — **opening a brand-new VS Code window on a freshly-created git worktree is totally doable** from an extension.\n\nThe tricky part is the *second half* of your request: **having your orchestrator “hand off” a subtask so it automatically spins up and runs inside that *other* window**, because that other window is a **separate extension host instance** and VS Code doesn’t give you a first-class “remote control another window” API.\n\n## What’s possible (cleanly) in VS Code\n\n### 1) Create a worktree (extension-side)\n\nVS Code doesn’t have a “git worktree API” in the stable public API, but an extension can just run:\n\n* `git worktree add <path> <branch-or-commit>`\n  (using `child_process` / `execa` etc.)\n\n(Just be mindful of **remote workspaces**: the `git` command runs wherever your extension host is running — local vs remote.) ([Visual Studio Code][1])\n\n### 2) Open that worktree in a *new* VS Code window\n\nThis part is explicitly supported:\n\n* `vscode.openFolder` with `{ forceNewWindow: true }` ([Visual Studio Code][2])\n* or `vscode.newWindow` (blank window) ([Visual Studio Code][2])\n\nExample:\n\n```ts\nimport * as vscode from \"vscode\";\n\nasync function openWorktreeInNewWindow(worktreePath: string) {\n  const uri = vscode.Uri.file(worktreePath);\n  await vscode.commands.executeCommand(\"vscode.openFolder\", uri, {\n    forceNewWindow: true,\n    // optional:\n    noRecentEntry: true,\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## What’s *not* provided out-of-the-box\n\nWhen you open a folder in a new window, that window runs extensions in its **own** extension host lifecycle. Also, opening a folder can restart/shutdown the current extension host in some cases (depending on same-window vs new-window), which hints at how isolated these contexts are. ([Visual Studio Code][2])\n\nSo: your orchestrator in Window A **cannot directly call a function** “inside Window B” after spawning it. There’s no built-in “send command to another VS Code window” channel.\n\n## The practical way to make your feature work\n\nYou basically implement a **handoff protocol** that Window B can discover on startup.\n\n### Pattern that works well: “bootstrap file” in the worktree\n\n1. Orchestrator creates the worktree folder.\n2. Orchestrator writes something like:\n   `<worktree>/.roo/bootstrap.json` containing:\n\n   * task id\n   * instructions / goal\n   * (optional) how to report back (port / socket / file paths)\n3. Orchestrator calls `vscode.openFolder(..., { forceNewWindow: true })`\n4. In Window B, Roo Code activates, detects `.roo/bootstrap.json`, and auto-starts the subtask UI + agent run.\n5. Window B writes progress back to:\n\n   * a status file (simple), or\n   * a local websocket/pipe that Window A started (more interactive)\n\nThis is *very* reliable because it doesn’t require cross-window APIs—just the filesystem.\n\n### Alternative: shared global storage\n\nYou can stash a “pending task” record in `context.globalState` before opening the window, and Window B reads it on activation. This can work, but it’s easier to get race conditions / “which window claimed it?” problems unless you build a proper claim/ack mechanism. The bootstrap file tends to be simpler and more debuggable.\n\n## Gotchas you’ll want to account for\n\n* **Remote workspaces (SSH/WSL/Codespaces):** the “where does git run?” question matters. Extension hosts can run local or remote depending on context. ([Visual Studio Code][1])\n* **UX expectations:** auto-starting a subtask the moment a window opens can feel surprising; many extensions show a “Resume task?” prompt the first time.\n* **Cleanup:** worktrees need pruning/removal later (`git worktree remove`, `git worktree prune`), and you’ll want to avoid leaving dozens of stale dirs.\n\n## Bottom line\n\n**Yes, it’s possible in the VS Code system**, but **not as a single atomic “open new window and keep controlling it” operation**. The “open worktree in new window” part is supported directly via `vscode.openFolder` ([Visual Studio Code][2]), and the “subtask runs there” part needs a **handoff mechanism** (bootstrap file / IPC) that the new window can pick up when Roo activates.\n\nIf you tell me roughly how Roo Code represents a “subtask” internally (task JSON? chat thread id? agent plan?), I can sketch a concrete bootstrap schema + claim/ack flow that won’t double-run tasks when multiple windows open.",
