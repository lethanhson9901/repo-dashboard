      "text": "Hi Roo team,\n\nI hope this isn't too controversial of an opinion.\n\nBut as an extremely heavy Roo user I've noticed a big degradation in stability over the last 3 weeks.\n\nI understand that Roo is a work in progress and you guys are moving very fast.\n\nBut personally I'm waking up each day wondering if my Roo is going to work today or not. As a professional it's difficult to rely on Roo.\n\nThen I have to go and read the Roo commits and figure out what actually changed.\n\nJust as an example, what looks like a minor update (3.36 -> 3.37) actually completely removed XML tool calls even for people who had specifically set it in previous versions. It took a while to figure out that this was the root cause of the regression.\n\nIt's resulted in breaking changes, and there actually wasn't any information in the changelogs here on Reddit about this.\n\nAnother recent change was the improved error notifications in the thread. These make some known errors look a lot better, but also obscure other errors behind \"Unknown error\". At the same time, many legitimate errors from Roo itself (for example rate limit) have not been handled in this, making Unknown error repeatedly show up every time rate limiting happens. It's little things like this to me which indicate that good ideas are being built but shipped too fast before proper testing and community feedback has been given.\n\nI am one of your biggest fans and I would love to be part of the solution. If there is some testing track I would be happy to trial things and provide feedback to you before you ship - or help contribute to an eval system that reduces the risk of regressions before updates go out. I have some pretty good ideas on the evals, we have built some really cool internal tools at my company for our rapidly expanding AI functionality.\n\nAs mentioned before I want to come across as constructive and very appreciative of the work you guys are doing - but the stability is really declining compared to a few months back and I think it's good to give clear feedback to maintainers when this happens.\n\nHopefully a new year will bring more stability while still seeing Roo get better and better! Merry Christmas!",

Using Gemini Pro through Gemini CLI has less total usage available, but in antigravity i've not hit any limits.

      "text": "Hey team!  \nFirst of all, **t**hanks for for Roo Code. I genuinely love using it. The flexibility, transparency, and overall agent freedom are way better than most coding agents out there. I'm sharing this feedback because I want it to get even better, as it is missing a lot on UI UX.\n\n# Main UX issue: lack of a proper STOP control\n\nWhen a task fails or gets stuck, the UI currently forces me into a loop:\n\n[STUCK!! Forever.  I wish there was a STOP button here :\\/ even Cancel is disabled. Have a single button for Stop\\/Cancel](https://preview.redd.it/tgdbd32vy3ag1.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5de8a7034fcab4e30e269848d4f386c8b2ed674)\n\nConsole shows: `ERR [Extension Host] Exponential backoff failed: Aborted during retry countdown`\n\n[Terminate -\\> new Chat \\(useless\\) and Resume Task \\(Starts the same failing loop\\)](https://preview.redd.it/q448zt82z3ag1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe2328ebd207b801cee41eacc3004f156ea2017e)\n\n\\- UI only gives **Resume** or **Terminate**  \n\\- Resume usually **retries the** ***same failing approach*** and gets stuck again almost everytime and this is REALLY Frustrating!! Instead of trying something new, it keeps on trying same thing and sometimes it never comes out of that and shows the above error.  \n\\- Terminate ends the task but still doesn't let me easily continue the conversation with a fresh request, rather creates a new chat, which is totally irrelevant here and doesn't serve any purpose then. I can anyway do that, so why terminate. terminate should simply STOP the current task/request, simple! You should never force a user to create new chat! **We can always do that on our own**\n\nWhat’s missing is a **simple, universal STOP button** like every other coding agent has. (it'd be better if you place that within the input bottom right like everyone does, proper usage of the space isntead of showing everything on top of input box! \n\nExpected behavior:\n\n* Stop the current call immediately\n* Keep chat/context intact\n* Let me issue a *new* request or correction without resuming the broken task\n\nRight now, I feel forced into restarting flows I don't want.\n\n[\\\\\"Start New Task\\\\\" - NOT NEEDED AT ALL !!! ](https://preview.redd.it/7r0dmhgpy3ag1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=611e7d39865f346d80c1867e6927e32608b0dd4f)\n\nAlso this big humungous START NEW TASK button is too distracting and not required at all tbh and I really get annoyed by this button taking previous space. I am not sure why every UI here want to force me into new chat which I don't want. I'd rather want to simply Stop current request at any stage I want, I want full control, and continue howsoever I want, either continue the same task or starting new conversation in same chat. Its upto the agent to interpret the context and everything. \n\nMinimal -> Compact -> Better UI UX\n\n\n\n[What's happening?](https://preview.redd.it/s5h1wcze04ag1.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d24094f9b1eea7c47d70480a0cb24cd884c6329)\n\nThe last suggestion, not that important, but here is the one suggestion, where I actually want detail but its kept minimal hahaha.\n\nWhy? Because sometimes it makes back to back multiple API calls, not sure what tool, or what kind of request its making internally, and most if it failed or doing correct or not, is not known at al!! I wish there was info icon here to click and see what happened in this API call, so that I know its doing correct thing/or correct tool call or received something or anything basically, instead of seeing this blank list of multiple API calls, that too with cost makes you think what magic is going there without my knowledge.\n\nI know there can be reasons behind why you designed things the way they are, could be any reason or others might have suggested, but the missing universal STOP button is something a MUST and please don't force always into creating new chat.",

A cleaner mental model: 1) Task state, 2) Chat state. STOP only touches task state. It should cancel retries, end the active run, and then drop you right back into the same chat with the input focused and a short “Run stopped” system message.\n\n\n\nOn top of that, give users a way to nudge the agent out of the rut: “resume with new plan,” “resume from step X,” or “resume read‑only, don’t execute tools yet.”\n\n\n\nFor the API calls list, an expand/collapse row with tool name, endpoint, and status would help a ton; tools like Cursor and Retool do this well, and I’ve had similar needs when debugging auto‑generated REST calls in DreamFactory. Main point: separate STOP from “new chat,” and make run details explorable instead of opaque.",

          "text": "I have the same issue, sometimes long running tasks get stuck and you can't cancel them.\n\nWhat can help is the VS Code command \"Developer: Restart extension Host\". You can bring up the command dialog with Ctrl + shift + p in vs code.\n\nAfter Roo Code restarts, you can then select the last task that got stuck (it will be at the top of the history list right on the main page)\n\nJust a workaround, hope this helps.",

But quite often I'd rather review and correct it before execution (e.g. remove an obviously unnecessary step or slightly modify it). However, Roo just steamrolls according to the plan, without asking any questions (you're a good soldier, Roo! :D).\n\nDid I miss some options or controls to make the TODO list editable? Any way to make Roo ask for a review before executing the plan? I'm looking for something like \"Plan&Act\" mode in other assistants.",
