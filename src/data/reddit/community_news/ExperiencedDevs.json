I was that guy pushing to rewrite stuff in Rust because it was trending then, wanted to use some experimental database I found on Github with 200 stars because the readme said it was web scale. Got into legitimate arguments about framework choices that in hindsight did not matter even a little bit.\n\nThen I became the person who had to fix things when they broke. Oh you wanted to try that new message queue? Cool, hope you enjoy debugging why it randomly loses messages at 2am. That distributed database you read about on Hacker News? Awesome, except now deploys take 6 hours and nobody knows why.\n\nAt some point I just got tired. Tired of explaining to product why we're three sprints behind because we're fighting our own infrastructure. Tired of being the only person who understands how some piece of critical infrastructure works because we picked something obscure.\n\nNow I'm boring as hell and I love it. Postgres? Yeah sure. Proven message systems? Absolutely. Things that have documentation written by humans who actually use the product? Sign me up.\n\nYou can still build cool shit with boring technology. Actually you can build way cooler shit because you're not spending half your time debugging your infrastructure instead of writing features.\n\nAnyway yeah, I'm officially old and boring now. My infrastructure should be so reliable I literally forget it exists. Save the excitement for the product.",

The reasons are exactly the same as why OP suggests embracing proven mature tech: reliability and predictable behavior are king.  \n\nApache, MySQL, and PHP peaked before we learned many painful but valuable lessons about webserver, DB, and framework/language design. Often their mistakes were *how* we learned -- or drove the industry moving in different directions.  Some of those problems cannot truly be fixed retroactively.\n\nIn this day and age, Postgres is better than MySQL in almost every way... and I say this as someone who has gone DEEP in MySQL and DBs in general.  Similarly the alternatives to Apache are generally stronger -- whether it's different webservers (Nginx etc) or alternative architectures such as static CDN-hosted assets + API servers or lambdas.  PHP hasn't aged quite so badly, but other mature languages are stronger on readability and encouraging maintainable practices.",

My primary nemesis in this regard is ORMs (Hibernate, Entity Framework, etc.). You guys realize that you're just writing random spammy SQL that will confound your database team for years to come, right? And that now you have to maintain the database schema in TWO places (in the database, and in the ORM you implement), right? And when the queries break, instead of being able to foist that job onto the database team while you work on something else, you'll have to debug both your code and the database schema just to figure out what's going on? The problem was never that SQL is difficult to deal with, the problem was that *databases* of any substantial complexity are difficult to deal with.\n\nAnd then there's AI, which I don't totally object to, but my prompts keep it very tightly controlled. Even when I do so, I find later on that it did something stupid, like create the exact same method in two different files, which I didn't notice because I only saw that the code was correct, not that it was in the wrong file.\n\nAnd then there's the infinite JavaScript frameworks, where I remember being interviewed as to whether I knew Angular.js (the original version) at the height of its popularity in 2016, and then watch its popularity decline rapidly as it was deprecated for the new version. Code bases aren't very resilient when the language they're written doesn't even last for a decade.",

Another aspect is that in this situation, the only place to edit schema is in the ORM, not in any of these databases. Contrariwise, when you have several applications talking to a central database or databases, where they all need to share a common set of data, stored procedures are to be preferred, as they act as an API that enforces all consumers to be limited to valid database actions. An ORM in the later case would imply that any change to the database schema to also be implemented in the dozens of applications using the database via ORM.\n\n",

Board looks great. All organized.\n\nCouple days later something breaks. Or priorities shift. Or we find out another team needed something we didn't know about. Plan falls apart.\n\nNext sprint? Same thing. Four hours. New plan. Dies in a few days.\n\nTracked this once because it was making me insane. Out of 20 sprints maybe 3 actually ended close to what we planned at the start. The rest just completely different by the end.\n\nSo what are we even doing? It's not planning if nothing survives. More like... I don't know. Making management feel better? Having something to point at?\n\nTeams I saw shipping well never did this. They'd just grab what looked important and start. Things changed? Cool, adjust. Keep moving.\n\nAnyway.

And I mean this roughly (think of it as a guide to follow in spirit) because 10 work-days does not divide into 6 at all.\n\nAnd you change the proportions depending on what the project is. If you are doing an early prototype, where you are iterating quickly and still learning and discovering fundamental things, you probably have no hard-commits at all. If the project is in chaos and there's a lot of firefighting, you may leave 1/3 open to handle firefights from the get-go (and this is also true on oncall weeks).",

          "text": "Here is what I do: when people keep consistently demolishing my plans, I refuse to make effort on planning.\n\nSometimes you need to exert a little bit of pressure on people you are working with to behave rationally.\n\nFor example, when somebody is consistently late to meetings (he/she set) or if they keep cancelling meetings, I stop coming to those meetings (except my boss, can't do much about that). Recently one guy asked me about that and I responded \"You cancelled last 5 occurrences, I just assume the meeting will not happen anyway\"\n\nI am currently in a situation where my product owner keeps making irrational plans. He is pressured to deliver at a certain date and rather than work to find reasonable solution he is pressuring everybody to accept his estimates. Those estimates obviously have nothing to do with reality and instead are made to prop up the idea we are on path to achieving success (success defined as meeting a self imposed deadline). Recently I stopped giving estimates and my official response is that \"every time I make an estimate it ends up with a long series of discussions about the merits of my estimate and my estimates end up replaced with the estimates of my PO. Frequently, the amount of effort on those discussions approaches the effort needed to perform the task. Therefore, I will no longer prepare any estimates, please, let PO fill in estimates by himself. At least this will free up my time to do other work.\"\n\nOf course, these estimates have nothing to do with reality and the only thing that is achieved is great amount of chaos, confusion and scope cutting when nearing development cutoff date.\n\nAnd the issue is that if I let in to the pressure I become responsible for the estimate because POs unrealistic wishes becomes my commitments.\n\n\\> Out of 20 sprints maybe 3 actually ended close to what we planned at the start. The rest just completely different by the end.\n\nHere is what you do.\n\nMake copious notes about \\*causes\\* of the sprint plans not being met. Try to find commonality. Try to find causes that are associated with majority of problems. Try to figure out some solutions to fix those.\n\nFor example, my current team has problem in that developers cannot reliably predict how much work a particular task needs to be done. I figured out significant cause of this is that most of the time the start of development is essentially a start of a research task to find out what are the requirements. This tends to require a huge amount of communication, meetings, frequently with senior people outside of our organization who are not available at moments notice.\n\nSo what I did is I created a checklist that lists what needs to be met before a task is accepted. Part of this checklist is a statement that a task needs to be defined in such a way that a developer can pick up and finish task without requiring to gather more requirements (and also other problems that require communication with others). All tasks are first assigned to me. What I do is I check if the task meets the criteria and is specified clearly and only if it is specified clearly I allow the task to be presented on sprint planning.\n\nIf the task does not meet the criteria I simply bounce it back and this way I try to protect the team at the cost of pressure on me (which I am fine with, I know how to deal with it).\n\nUnfortunately, the team can't do it because the developers frequently feel pressured to accept the task even if they don't really understand the task. That's another problem I am working on.",

The point is to learn to quickly iterate and improve the process.\n\nThe checklist is \\*outcome\\* of an ongoing improvement process. It has items that are only relevant to our team. It is being constantly updated as new problems are identified and old problems stop being problems so we remove process that support solving those.\n\nWhen I join a failing Agile team, I am doing almost exactly the opposite what others are doing. Others are coming with books, papers and ready made checklists that are supposed to improve the process. But this is anti-Agile. Agile is about improvement and what these people are doing they are trying to standardize process and take away the team's ability to shape it.\n\nWhen I join the team, I come with exactly zero process. Every process that is instituted is exactly in response to and directly related to the problems that team is having. Every member of the team is part of creating the process because I want to make the team feel responsible for the process and be part of the improvement. I also want them to understand why we are doing things.\n\nNow, if I shared the checklist with you, you would ask \"Is that it? Is this really the thing that is supposedly improved the team's performance by multiple orders of magnitude?\" And the answer is that the journey is more important than the end. If you helicopter yourself to the top of Mt Everest you will not feel the satisfaction of conquering it. And if you take a train instead of completing pilgrimage, you will not feel the spiritual effects you wanted. And if you take existing checklists and rules and process from external sources you will not achieve the goals of Agile.",

Any Stories being pulled into a Sprint are known by the team and have been estimated, and prioritised (by e.g. Product with team in partnership, or with team and stakeholders by some kind of passive-aggressive negotiation; it is a bank after all) previously. 1 hour TOPS for team of up to 12 or so. 30 mins if 6 or less and your game is tight. Nothing should be a surprise in here. (You might need 30 mins of admin/close-down for previous Sprint if you're not getting finished/suffering distractions or your sprints are wanky/getting crashed. Keep it to a separate session though or _ideally_ have the devs/testers do all the close-down admin themselves, in advance of planning. That's what my best teams used to do and it's fucking amazing.\n  \n\n2. A prior session to prioritise (rank/discuss dependencies/weigh up what the next few weeks look like and make some decisions about what gets dev-time) e.g. \"go time now for that tech debt thing we talked about last Retro cause feature X is gonna need that sorted\". Called \"Prioritisation\". 30 to 45 mins tops. Every sprint to keep it short and relevant: i.e. soon/upcoming.\n\n  \n3. A session prior to that to break down Epics into Stories and/or Estimate the Stories. Called \"Refinement & Estimation\". I'd recommend sticking up a recent but Done \"5 pointer\" on the wall/on-screen somehow and using it as a benchmark to calibrate sizing of new work. Obvs pick a 5 point Story that mostly everyone agrees was a solid 5 points. \n\n\nAnything that is wildly unknown or unknowable should be given Spikes (time-boxed to X days) or turned into a KDD for research, or given a 20 or 40 and retyped as an Epic and broken down into Stories in a future session. 1 hour TOPS. Do it every Sprint to keep duration down.\n  \n  \nNever let the team neglect these ceremonies; teams tend to eat each other when they run out of work.\n  \n  \nNone of these good practices will prevent your sprints from being crashed by the way, by shit systems breaking and/or shit management grabbing your engineers and demanding output from them. That needs to be tackled separately.\n\n\nBut four fucking hours of \"sprint planning\" where you're trying to do all of the above in one session is ineffective and just a bit weak/immature agile-wise. People will be in various states of interested/disinterested/bored/fed up if you try to do all of the above in one meeting.",

All three sessions you described? Consultants said do it in one 4-hour block. So that's what we did.\n\nAnd here's the thing, when you try to push back and say \"this should be split up,\" management's response is \"McKinsey charged us $500k for this framework, are you saying they're wrong?\"\n\nIt's what I call risk management theater. Leadership hides behind the consultancy. If it fails, they can blame the execution not the decision. \"We hired the best consultants, did what they said, must be the team.\"\n\nYour breakdown is exactly how it should work. But getting there requires convincing management that their expensive consultants gave them the wrong playbook. Almost impossible conversation in banking.

Some will take longer, some shorter, but ideally you put in the effort to break down the tickets when they are “big”. This also helps to satisfy folks who “want higher velocity”, as you can increase perceived velocity by breaking down tickets more and more.\n\nThis sort of pattern leads to being able to more accurately predict how quickly things will get done, given a known queue depth. Every so often (week, month, quarter, etc) just add up all the tickets completed, and that count is your “velocity in points”. Track that against a given project or backlog to see your burn down.",

If the board is used to measure productivity and delivery of work, then it should absolutely be used to nip unrealistic work and scope creep, as well as track capacity. Unfortunately that rarely happens, most PMs/managers aren't willing to stand their ground and defend the board, they just care about optics of velocity and agile half-heartedly. Closing more features, steeper burndown charts, illusion of delivery to management. Eventually the board becomes theater, they tell a fairy tale plot, and you dance on stage, performing vanity projects on top of operational tasks.\n\nA lot of this is due to incentivization and lack of understanding what is actually required for delivering a technical solution, there is no architect to enforce reality. Performance is largely based on how many projects they had their hands in and how many people they manage, not quality or effectiveness of technical delivery. The org incentivizes bandwidth, not throughput.\n\nUnderstanding this concept was key for me. One mistake I made was trying to be the defender of the board. I thought by defending planned work, reducing congestion, and protecting throughput to deliver better products was the answer, but this only gets you seen as a naysayer and reducer of bandwidth. Some orgs don't have any mechanisms for recognizing or rewarding throughput as they don't measure effectiveness of technical solutions, congestion, latency, or quality of service, this requires an architect to measure. They only measure on bandwidth, velocity, and loudness.\n\nOnce you understand this, the agile framework only follows suit. The business actually wants waterfall but agile is there for formality. The goal is to sell bandwidth like you're an ISP, not throughput. The plan becomes less about being accurate or even detailed, it becomes an interpretive dance with loud features, flashy lights, selling your work (maybe some belly dancing?), and promising things that you can actually deliver quicker than expected and dealing with what actually needs to be done off the board.",

          "text": "Everything that enters a sprint unplanned is called a fastlane (at least in Jira). At my last company, we had a similar problem to yours. Until the team leaders set down together with management and decided that every fastlane needs CTO-approval. Suddenly, a lot of things could wait a sprint or two.\n\nAdditionally, in the sprint review with all the stakeholders, fastlanes were explicitly discussed, giving us the backing from different departments when denying them wherever possible.\n\nYou mentioned a VP suddenly standing in your office and demanding stuff. That is already an issue. A foreign VP shouldn't give tasks to a development team, they should give them to your manager/director/department lead/whatever. They then decide how to prioritize things and, if needed, they bomb your sprint. Then they can also discuss with you once they notice how every sprint dies.\n\nI had a similar issue once at a startup, where sales and marketing directly walked to the devs to ask for help with something. That resulted in the dev lead not knowing what the devs where working on and made him very sad, thus it got changed at some point.\n\nOverall, this has to be solved by management. Now, assuming your manager doesn't care, what can you do?\n\n1. Inform stakeholders. Whenever you get a fastlane, or no later than in the next sprint review, let the stakeholders of the stuff you planned to work on know that their things got pushed back as authorized by VP Bob. If they don't care then why should you, if they care let them talk to Bob, not your issue. Of course, make that more informative and less finger pointing; as always, office politics apply.\n\n2. Involve your manager/VP/whatever, let it be their decision.\n\n3. Plan the unplanned into your sprints. If you get interrupted regularly, plan with less tickets. If you don't get interrupted for once, have some low priority tickets in the backlog that you already wanted to do for months.\n\n4. Switch to Kanban, as already mentioned by others, and let other people fight about priorities. If necessary, implement a process letting stakeholders see why their ticket got pushed back, what ticket was put in front of it and who authorized it (see 1.).\n\n5. Figure out how there can be such major bugs in production systems regularly (because some issue on a test system doesn't justify a fastlane) and address that. Maybe you need better testing? Hire a QA guy?\n\n6. Stop caring so much, obviously no one else does. Figure out what you need to do to satisfy everyone and then simply work. Who cares about sprints anyway?\n\nIn the end, it's understandable. Someone is blocked and you can unblock them, and instead of blaming their poor planning they blame you and want it fixed asap. Their manager only hears \"I do no work because...\" and of course demands you fix that right away. If you neither have the right to push back nor a manager to handle that for you, then this strategy works for them. But again, that's not a problem you can solve. You need to convince management that it would be beneficial if you could actually do the work you planned, without buy-in from them you can't change much.",

If it's something really important, we'll dedicate a full cycle to it, otherwise we might batch a few smaller items into a cycle, and leave some even smaller work for the adhoc team.\n\n\n\nThe ceremonies every two weeks were killing me. Grooming, story points, retro, standup with the full team, etc. With this, we do a 6 week cycle and then a 2 week cool down. We will do one retro during this time. Sometimes we will knock out small design defects, user reported issues, as well as work on shaping for the next cycle. Our PM usually has some features nailed down pretty well, we usually talk to her, come up with some high level designs, get some initial feedback from a designer, spike on some code a bit, and put everything into a doc outlining the problem, the solution, initial designs, etc. \n\n\n\nIt also gives more junior/mid level devs the opportunity to lead a project, especially if it is a little smaller in scope. You can help them do some planning and support them during the project while they lead the project and interface more with the stakeholders. And let them run with more and more of it over time.\n\n\n\n\nIt's worked insanely well for me at 2 different companies. I like being part of digging into the issue as well as helping ship it.

Commitments mean nothing and the plan means nothing.\n\nWanted to clarify that this is true in the described scenario and that when done well all these things mean something. First priority is getting control of destiny and making a realistic plan. Your first goalpost with it is “most stories get closed out within the sprint, stories are only rarely added in the sprint.” The majority of your team’s work at this point is *inherently* tied to a sprint and can’t really fail; the sprint is over, so covering a rotational duty for said sprint just *IS* done. Significant events and contributions are logged in each story. At the end of the sprint anything pending or in flight under these rotational stories (cross team/vp ask/bug patrol/release duty) is either neatly handed off to the next sprint’s rotational story or captured in a proper story.\n\n70% of your stories are planned coverage for known varieties of high priority work. the way the stories are conceptualized means you now have a FLOOR of 70% story completion.\n\nNow you’re in a position to start realistically concerning yourself with the other 30%. Whatever your pointing system, hopefully fib, you align on what point value maps to “a mid level dev would need to work on this and only this with minimal interruption to reliably complete it within the sprint.” Your lowest point value is “this could reliably be completed in a single productive afternoon.”\n\nThen you stop thinking directly about time for everything in between. You talk and think about the factors that contribute to these estimations. “Updating the values of 80 constants is a 2 because there’s nothing complicated about it but also it’s going to be tough to make sure all 80 were updated correctly.” “I estimated this one as a 3 because I *know* there are places where the constant value is used without the variable so we’ll need to fix that as part of the story. Some analysis is going to be involved and it’s probably best to update one by one.” “For those same reasons and more I went with a 5; we also misuse the variables in a few places which has been the root cause of some recent production bugs. It’s really just not as simple as editing 80 constants, and our tests are absolutely going to need fixing.”\n\nThe discussion about points should be like half the value of the meeting, as it’s  a great way to get further clarity and consensus about what’s really going into a story. It builds communal literacy in assessing a story, and also works as a tangential knowledge sharing.\n\nIt’s possible for points, commitments, plans to mean something, your team/org just hasn’t really drawn the boundaries or put in the work/discipline to make it happen. Agile ain’t perfect and I agree that it’s become a snake oil pyramid scheme, really a munchausen by proxy role. Dedicated agile coaches have a built in incentive to make some improvement while keeping teams sick. They have a conflict of interest where having the team depend on them and being able to say they are still teaching and correcting people on the team about pure agile stuff is at odds with what will actually work with the team.\n\nBut agile itself is totally serviceable. It just requires smart and experienced engineers like yourself to lean into it and apply all your problem solving skills to the process itself. It’s like a language or framework that you’re stuck with in a shitty legacy application. Instead of abandoning the language/framework, figure out how to use it well and clean up the app.\n\nGlhf.

She worked as a manager of engineering teams at her previous jobs.\n\nSo far, every one of our 1:1s has only been negative feedback for me, given in a somewhat scathing/demeaning manor. I have received zero positive feedback. I am taking it on the chin and am doing my best to apply everything she is asking. There is no acknowledgement of progress.\n\nI have asked for candid feedback from my teammates, and while they had minor points to share, the severity or quantity does not match what my manager is expressing.\n\nIn addition, I am not receiving any support or direction from her. Her only answer is \"these are our new processes, and you are expected to know the answer\". When I ask for clarification, she seems to get frustrated and becomes accusatory. \n\nMy assumption is that the company owners want to fire me, and they have instructed my new manager to set me up for failure so that they have cause. But this confuses me, as they have not hired anyone new and the company would be screwed without me as we are in the middle of large projects that only I can do.\n\nFor context, I am not perfect. I have issues with communication and availability. I do not miss deadlines however. And my manager has acknowledged consistently that my work is top-quality. I am known in our little bubble of our little industry, I have spoken at conferences, and we have gained work from Fortune 25 companies as a direct result. They hire us just for my expertise (I'm not particularly skilled, but again my work is niche). In addition, our team has won awards for my work at these conferences.\n\nWhile I genuinely appreciate the manager's feedback, the severity and manner is causing me more stress than I can handle.\n\nWhat do I do? I have never applied for a job. In 22 years, I have only been offered work and employment. A few weeks ago a competing company offered me a job, but I like the people and the work here. I don't want a change.",

Why do you think that is?  Based on your statement, your manager likely isn't qualified for the job and sees you as a threat who will eventually expose them since you're the only one who would be able to identify that they have no idea what they are doing.  Your manager is trying to get rid of the threat, but they aren't savvy enough to understand what it would mean for the business if they actually get you fired.  Perhaps this is wrong, but if your manager isn't providing any sort of coaching to solve the negative feedback, at some point only one of you is going to be working at the company, and it's not going to depend on whether you jump through their hoops to address the feedback since they aren't giving you a way to do it.  I'd say your best bet would be to reach out to your old manager for casual conversation and eventually broach the subject of your past performance and ask if there was anything they thought you could have improved upon while they were your manager, and if they have nothing negative segue into your current performance feedback asking for advice on how to improve.  If anything, this will give you information on where the owner stands on wanting you around without explicitly asking if they want to fire you, and if they have no idea what your manager is doing, it will give them some breadcrumbs to start paying more attention.",

But a female coworker did and was told that it was more important to the owner to have a cto than it was to have an engineer and if I made them pick they were going to pick him. \n\nThe main difference is I was not going to ever get fired. The cto was stoked when I quit because they wouldn’t let him fire me.",

Then - stay patient and make them all pay as soon as you get the payout.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the owners want to get rid of you (and I doubt they do; it makes zero sense, for multiple reasons. Like you say - even if they wanted to get rid of you, they need you too much.), be a man (or a woman, or a furry creature from Alpha Centauri; you do you!) and set your boundaries. Do not negotiate your boundaries, do not give a fraction of an inch, do not ask. Tell them what your boundaries are, and what the consequences will be if they are not respected.\n\nThe one and only caveat: Think hard about whether you could continue to work with her as your manager even if she changes, or if the history you now have with her would be too much. If the latter, be fair to the owners and give them the only two options they have left.\n\n\n\n",

She can't just fire you on her whim; she needs to document it somehow. She needs to have arguments against you. Somebody *will* ask her at some point \"why do you want to fire this guy\". Think about what could those arguments be, and address them before hand, so she can't use them. If you know what the arguments could be, but you can't address them or you can't fix them, then accept that *she may have a point*.\n\nImagine how a conversation could look like between you, her, HR or some boss. What arguments could be raised against you, what arguments could you use against her. Prepare yourself for these arguments by resolving them *before this conversation happens*. Make sure you make her acknowledge these potentially important arguments are resolved on any 1:1 you have with her.\n\nBut also *don't fall into the trap of thinking you need to have more than everyone else just because you always had more*, or because you're an old employee. New managers love to exploit that. Maybe this is this case.\n\nIt might also be some kind of \"women's empowerment\" ideology going on, especially if you're a middle aged white male.\n\nHave in mind that in the management chain, it's very common for an employee to *not like* their supervisor, and you need to have *heavy and documented evidence* if you want to walk this road. Without evidence, it might be seen as \"he'll complain, complain, complain, but eventually he'll get used to it\".\n\n> In addition, I am not receiving any support or direction from her. Her only answer is \"these are our new processes, and you are expected to know the answer\". When I ask for clarification, she seems to get frustrated and becomes accusatory.\n\nPlease give an example of what those accusations looks like.\n\nEscalate to higher management that you need those answers, but your manager doesn't provide it to you. Don't accuse the manager of anything. Make sure higher management knows that there is a problem with providing information. The manager also has her work. She needs to follow the rules as well. Make sure you point out those rules.",

I actually liked moving fast, being productive. but I think i was losing it seeing that nobody really knew what they were doing, from the c-suite all the way down to dev team.\n\ndon’t get me wrong, some of the best engineers I’ve worked with were at these startups. but there was also much bs, and people being extremely confident while clearly not knowing what they are doing.\n\nbeing mostly at series-b/c companies made it worse. that awkward stage where the company is “maturing” and “scaling,” but you still wake up to Bob's 2k+ line PR of junk that's \"urgent\".\n\nnow i feel like a small fish in a big pond, surrounded by really strong devs with tons of legit experience building things that have real users and implications. the pace is slower. the attention to detail and process is better. still some bs. but its a breath of fresh air. also probably helps that those tech leads above me have decade+ of experience and can back it up and code circles around me, rather than someone who graduated a bootcamp last year and is “leading” because they know how to run `npx create-react-app` when the founder was hiring.",

The success of the product is often decided by what mental abuse the CEO wants to inflict and who they inflict it on. It can be fun if you are really into what you are into and the product is making enough money that the success overwhelms the higher ups. \n\nMid is more balanced. There is productive levels of stress. I think I worked 1 Saturday a year for 8 years. I had input on my work before it hit my desk. I could say no to stuff and yes to others in a way that allowed negotiation with product teams. We had money for tools, established widely used standardized software tools. I could use Windows and Android and not deal with culty logic and sub optimal tooling and hardware when things went really wrong. I just pulled some parts out the closet and went about my day. When we needed an AI we just bought a mining rig and some gpus and did the work and expensed it.\n\nAt the second mid size, if i left my desk i would pass a bottle of vodka under a coworkers desk. Then a mini bar. Then a kambucha tap. Then a convince store bar deli. Then a hard liquor store. Then a brewery before getting  to my car. When I got a memo about when and when it is not ok to expense strippers I decided to go back to megacorps.\n\nMegacorp there is no talking talking back. Its not slave labor but it's the mindset of slavery. You don't express anything that would make anyone uncomfortable about anything ever, even if what they are saying do something kinda non-compliant. The environment was cheap, often smelled of farts or microwaved fish.  I think I met my coworkers two times in 4 years. \n\nThese are not bad people. There are just so many rules, the reality of capitalism, and the reality of survival. When someone disappears for the day silently you don't say anything unless it interferes with work. It's much harder to get ahead because of all the rules, funding wars and downsizing. It sucks in a different way.\n\n\nI would rank it mid, megacorp, then startups.\n\nMid at 90\nMegacorp at 50\nStartup at 30",

There are tons of projects I was excited about at the time, and even ones that I thought were genuinely cool, but almost none of them survived the years and/or stand out in my mind as being valuable.\n\nA super old one that comes to mind is [https://www.dronetonetool.com](https://www.dronetonetool.com). My boss in like 2012 paid me $50 cash to make this little jQuery web app for his cousin, who is a music teacher. The functionality is silly, but I was really proud of the CSS. At some point somebody added a donate button and made mobile app wrappers for it, but other than that it's exactly as it was when I shipped it.\n\nAnother one that comes to mind is a script I wrote a few years ago that analyzes images produced by a Scanning Electron Microscope and calculates the thickness in microns of various features in the image. I was proud of it because it was a side project outside of my sprint work that I spent two evenings on, used zero dependencies, and it ended up being used by scientists in the lab for like two years after that to save them from manually measuring these things. I don't think they're still using it, but I was proud of it.\n\nFunny, I can't think of any actual business products I've worked on that I'm proud of.",

Over five years the company scaled from zero to $1B+ in revenue across four core products. I contributed to three and owned two end to end.

Not cutting corners, but being explicit about tradeoffs. \n\nWe spent real time discussing design decisions, avoided premature complexity and resisted chasing new tools without a clear payoff. \n\nIt was less about being clever and more about making informed decisions.\n\nLastly, communication was open and broadly shared. \n\nThe environments were mostly remote, which acted as a forcing function. \n\nWe prioritized written communication over verbal, with most discussion happening in shared chats rather than meetings or formal docs. \n\nMost formal documentation lived in our tests, which were heavily commented for historical context. Maintaining this was enforced in code reviews. \n\nThat working style came largely from open source backgrounds, where async collaboration and visible context are the norm. \n\nIt’s opinionated and not for everyone, but it worked well for us and for the type of people we hired.",

I have this strain of corn, how well will it grow on this field? how about the next? They were trying to sell this as a very accurate way to tell farmers which land to rent or buy. I wasn't doing any of that work, but to sell the model well, they needed good visualizations.\n\nSo I am then asked to lead a project where we'd visualize the results of the model, on every field in the united states: You load a map, and can zoom in all the way to each individual plot. As you zoom out, it aggregated to median data. A fun, interesting little visualization project, right? Well, it was a complete success. It allowed us to see exactly what results the model was providing, and you could see exactly how reliable it was.... except of course, it wasn't reliable. The numbers were plausible on most normal fields in the corn belt, but as you zoomed out, you'd see... a map of US states. People would ask me why I added the staets.. .except I didn't. It just happens that the data was so broken, a key important factor was being decided at the state level in the model: So big you could see the states as you zoomed out. Cross the border between Iowa and Illinois? 20% difference in corn yield. And the model was equally broken on every crop. No matter what, the soil maps, weather maps and all of that were just not all that important.\n\nNeedless to say, while this was an accurate visualization of what the startup's technology did, it was also something that said its core technology was an unsellable disaster, because every farmer would laugh at the numbers, as in the real world, states don't matter. Not much later came major layoffs, as I had successfully shown execs most of their company's \"valuable\" IP was not in a sellable state.",

I was also proud of a particular implementation detail I added which resulted in greatly improved performance over the company's existing solution, which meant that people immediately saw the value in it.\n\nIt's still chugging along, with the occasional bug fix here and there, but not much has changed since its initial implementation.",

However I was proud because I did grow a lot and did a lot of things that I never thought I would do.\n2. Projects of big organizations where the end product is very impressive but work was meh. Bad tech, 0 ownership, vast (pointless I would say) processes, bureaucratic boomer attitude. Well I am not proud of that because it didnt feel like building the product. It felt like I was battling some Kafkaesque nightmare.\n3. A \"successful\" project that ended up in a product sold globally, where I was solely responsible for the software of half the system. The bad management, the bad client and the absurd deadlines made the whole process traumatic. I was so burnt out that I quit shortly after and never wanted to talk about that project. Today I see it used in my city's metro system but I largely don't care.\n4. A project that was 2 of the best years of my career. A very good senior colleague that taught me so many things made that special. Very nice processes that made sense. Good management that did not get in the way. I did have ownership in some critical features but I contributed to a lot of others as well. I even made an internal tool that was praised by everyone and ended up as a significant step in the process. Cool product, something I never thought it existed, yet we were writing the new version of it. Bad proprietary hardware that made software super interesting diving a lot to low level and compilers etc. Yet the project was killed because of politics... This was essentially the project that made me a much better engineer and it was a fancy product that I would be super proud if it succeeded. I am still very proud about the internal tool that we used it for 6 months.",

Our corporate overlords wanted us to use their CMS to publish our site. Their tool sucked. It was slow, clunky, and would have required lots of abuse of the interface to get the features our editorial team wanted. I pitched my VP that I could build a custom publishing system that would meet all our needs, quickly and cheaply. Just give me an equipment and personnel budget and I'll make it happen. I led that project, did a ton of coding, supervised the other programmers, acted as DBA, system administrator (we didn't have the word devops back then), wrote a whole system to process user submitted video (much trickier in the pre-smartphone era), etc. It was a smashing success. Editorial was thrilled. Ad sales was thrilled. I gave presentations to the rest of the company about it. It served millions of visitors for over 10 years. When they finally decomissioned it I had moved on, but I got on a conference call with the people I knew who were still there and we had a little memorial ceremony for it.",

We all met at the company HQ for a week to test the new product, and it was great for the MVP. Me and my team were the last devs standing on the legacy app and had kept the boat afloat while lots of others were pulled off to do the new thing. The CFO of the company told me at one of the dinners we had that my team did too good of a job and it was going to make it a lot harder to pitch the new app to customers.\n\nWe prevented customers from churning and made the legacy app a lot more stable and predictable. Reduced the crash and error rate significantly. It was old tech but I still wonder today if it would have been better to refactor the existing app instead of rewriting it. Sorta doesn’t matter now since we got sold and the new company is… meh.",

Actually true of people too.\n\nSo you might have supported an application for years, but what you'll remember is that the userbase dried up, or someone screwed up and saved passwords in plaintext, or whatever.\n\nThis is especially true in today's world of Software As A Service, where it's very rare for software to actually \"ship\" - it doesn't have a line drawn under it until it's inviable.  That's inevitably going to lead to disappointing memories.\n\nI single handedly ran a platform for an engineering company for about a decade.  Built from scratch on vanilla PHP (their choice) and  expanded into a fully-fledged system with user management, caching, data ingest, self repairing...  I went back and looked at the code the other day.  Absolute garbage and I cringe to say I wrote it.\n\nBut again, code is a product of circumstance.  That was a product of shifting priorities, constantly evolving specs, demanding clients - and the occasional idiotic bug.  I'm just one man.  That code brought in millions, never got hacked (that we know of) and ran financial payout calculations for several clients - which I only found out after it'd been happening for about a year.  I just about shat myself and spent a week shoring my code up.\n\nMy point is that it's very rare in this industry, I think, to get the Hollywood champagne-party-launch and Scarface montage of success.  You get to sit in the chair another day, and write code that, on reflection, you can be privately proud of.  That's success.",

I automated a very chaotic and complex process that every tech firm encounters eventually, and spent 2 years building a system to make it so easy and automatic that it became practically a non-issue. But then again, someone from the US-office (different company this time) stole the sources, somehow sold them to Asia and two years later a startup sprang up selling it as SaaS and got tens of millions of funding and is now the leading company in that field...\n\nAs I got 0 money or credit for doing my best work, I eventually grew so bitter that I haven't felt like doing those kind of large projects for the last 8 years.

I've been incredibly lucky to work on multiple globally famous projects. \n\nIt is forgotten now, but I wrote one of the first 3rd party video games for the Commodore Vic-20 back in '82. \n\nFrom that, I got invited to participate in 1983 as a 3rd party developer and tester for the then unreleased Apple Macintosh. \n\nDuring that period, I learned of and got a job at a 3D graphics research lab; this was '85 and at that time 3D graphics *was research*, there was no fast polygon rendering, no ray tracers, no 3D animation nothing. I ended up working for *Benoit Mandelbrot* on his now famous Fractal Mathematics research. I also was a part of the creation of the first 3D modelers, and first 3D animation systems. \n\nMy first job out of college was for Philips, in their research group creating the CD-ROM and streaming media. I was the guy that originally wrote the streaming media support in multiple operating systems, including all the game consoles of the time. I was on the OS teams for the (failed) 3D0 and the original PlayStation, where I wrote their video subsystems. \n\nWhile it Philips I wrote an award winning documentary production system, and that was used to make over 100 documentaries, which I was the technical director. \n\nWhile at Electronic Arts I was on the OS team for the 3D0 and the teams for Road Rash 3D0, the original Tiger Woods Golf, NCAA Football, and several others.\n\nI worked briefly at a dotcom during the dotcom era, and there I wrote the world's first live video codec for streaming video over the Internet. \n\nThen I went into feature film VFX and worked on about a dozen high profile films as a digital artist, a programmer, and then a financial analysis (I was getting an MBA at the same time.) It was the 3D live action versions of the Scooby Doo movies, the Garfield films, and the Narnia films, I worked on those and several more. \n\nIt was making film VFX that I figured out and then patented what are now called Deep Fakes. I was trying to create personalized advertising, see yourself in advertising, but the world wanted personalized porn. I and my team of film VFX pros refused to make porn, and I went bankrupt. I put my life savings into that technology, people did not believe it was possible, and then they did they insisted it be used for moral crime. I refused. \n\nI ended up going into facial recognition, where I helped a company that wrote 3D reconstruction software become a facial recognition company. Our work ended up being the #3 globally ranked facial recognition server and probably the most popular one after Genetec, the global leader. \n\n...and my wife is more successful than I.",

Without naming the projects here's my perspective on why they failed (one point per-project):\n\n* Leadership decided that the work could be done in 8 weeks by 4 independent contractors under the guidance of a Director setting the strategy, a Solution Architect devising the implementation, and an Engineering Manager guiding the day-to-day.  That's 4 devs, 3 \"leads\", and 2 months to try and deliver a complete rearchitecture of our data pipeline.  The Director was a kiss-up/kick-down idiot, the Solution Architect was inexperienced and created a solution involving 8 Lambdas for a system that would service 1500 users at peak load with a TAM of maybe 5x that, and the manager was me insisting almost daily that this wasn't going to work but being told that I had to \"make it work\" by said Director.  Unsurprisingly, it didn't work and was cancelled after 6 months. \n\n* The product itself was excellent, had great product/market fit, and was devised by one of our guys with 10+ years experience.  New leadership came in, didn't like the timeline, and insisted that we gut 70% of the feature set to deliver it faster.  Adoption was poor because it no longer solved the problem it set out to solve. \n\n* The integration we built was part of a partnership to cross-sell each others' product.  It worked fine but sales were poor and it was later deprecated. \n\n* We converted a crazy VBA-laden Excel file into a web-based tool for an internal team.  Nobody wanted to use the web-based tool and they kept using the Excel file with VBA.  \n\n* It was a startup bet to act as a lower cost of acquisition for new customers that we could upsell on other core features of the product.  What we built didn't work reliably and hemorrhaged money because we couldn't recollect from our customers.  It was shut down.",

It’s now doing $16M/year revenue.\nI also have several >$20M/year cost-savings wins under my belt, but the \"rogue\" successes were infinitely more fun.\nThe takeaway for me: The best projects often happen when the \"process\" gets out of the way and the developers solve a problem they actually understand.",

          "text": "I know this is counter to 95% of the people on this thread, but I honestly can say Scrum (very strictly followed scrum, in particular) is what made Successful Projects possible for me. Before then, it was hit or miss. Almost by chance. Chance that we got the cost estimate right and didn't run over budget. Chance that we got the time estimate right and didn't have to sacrifice features, functionality, or spit & polish due to timelines. Chance that the client correctly communicated what they want and/or what they wanted didn't change before project end due to external forces; that the finished product met the overall desires and expectations of the client. When a project takes more than 3 months, it's simply unrealistic to expect nothing to change for the client. Budget, expectations, needs, and desires _will_ change and it should be ok for them to do so. \n\nWith scrum (_strict, to the letter_ scrum), we were able to roadmap work in iterations. We were able to to continually review the work with the client and ship it, continually reverifying and re-analyzing direction and goals. With each iteration, the client was able to not just see the resulting work, but use and play with it. If the client decided, \"hey, actually, i don't need those other things, this is meeting my needs as is!\" then great, client is super happy and spends less money and we're free to move on to the next project. If it ran over, it was because the client made an informed decision to add new items or priorities or was involved in the process enough that it didn't come as a surprise; that they had already been made well aware of delays as they occurred. \n\nWhen we found ourselves on the wrong path, the biweekly sprint review with stakeholders would put us back on the right path. When the client had required changes or emergencies, we could add new tickets, working with the client to remove or deprioritize others of equivalent point value to keep things on track re: time and budget. When the team found themselves not operating or producing as expected, the bi-weekly retrospective allowed us to self-analyze, call out issues, and make improvements. \n\nOn the whole, the transparency, the inspection, and the adaptation (as it so happens, the \"three pillars of scrum\") ensure that by project end the client can't be anything but pleased with the result. \n\nI'm sure I'll get some comments to the contrary. And they won't be wrong. I've seen first hand so many instances of Agile-Gone-Wrong. At my previous job leading the account/checkout division international e-commerce platform, we had great success running our own little team with Scrum. Once the company-at-large got wind of our success, they wanted to implement it site wide. We advocated Scrum Nexus, they went with the horrific monstrosity that was SAFe. It was a productivity black hole. All this is to say, there are so many variants of agile, so many ways to run it, that are fucking terrible. But in my experience, hardcore, strict-as-fuck scrum is a near guarantee for project success.",

      "text": "The company I work for hired a junior a few months back. He is fresh out of university, cannot express himself very well,and during his time in college he made some consulting, and write some shallow tutorials in medium. Unsurprisingly, he has this mindset in which the more code he wrote and merge, the better employee he is, regardless the code nor the impact. It's ok, I was there once too.  \nMy manager wanted me to pair with him to slowly introduce him into the code base, starting with the easiest service. Im a senior but he doesn't report to me, so my work with him is meant to be collaborative where I lead and he follows.\n\nThe situation is the following:\n\nWhen I onboarded him and tried to give him permissions, he dismissed my questions and instructions quite abruptly and immediately sent me a PR to review. I chose to ignore that.\n\nLater, he spent weeks reviewing PRs he was assigned to, consistently approving everything without real review — including large PRs in a language he openly said he had never used, for a project he hadn’t been introduced to. On top of that, he started rushing others to merge, saying he had “already reviewed it.”\n\nWhen we started working together on a project, I assigned him a few tasks meant to help him get familiar with the service. He delivered quickly, but while the code looked polished, it lacked proper functionality: tests were missing or superficial, patterns weren’t followed, and he hadn’t tested the code. I gave clear feedback, explaining that testing and understanding the service was the whole point of the exercise. He ignored this, added reviewers outside the project to get approvals, and merged as soon as he could. The code was, unsurprisingly, broken. I told him I was happy to help if testing was difficult, as it’s part of the learning process.\n\nDuring a meeting to plan future work, he proposed a new way of working that would require appointing a tech lead, hinting himself for that role. The rest of the team reacted with visible awkwardness.\n\nAt some point he also started to review my work (definition, design, analysis and decomposition of tasks) to which he didn't have no background. Since he couldn't understand what I was talking about there, and with other people, he said that my work was incomplete and I had to add information that was lacking and pay attention because \"was very complex and not common\".  \n\\[...\\]\n\nI ended up talking with my manager and his manager (who seemed to have seen those signals and agree with me). Explained what I observed, what I tried how he responded and the aftermath was his manager talking to him, and him pairing with somebody else. I can see my other colleague is not super happy about the collaboration but things seem smoother.\n\nI can't help feeling that the result for my manager was \"I couldn't manage the situation\", so it's just better to change. Im trying to grow in my role and influence is a big part of this, so:\n\n\\- How would you solve this situation more autonomously? I would like to avoid go to my manager for help but rather saying \"I have this ~~problem~~ blocker, I propose to do this, do you agree\" without losing the project Im working with, or how solid I can be perceived.  \n  \n\\- Would you have talked before? Or only talked with his manager?\n\n\\- Other advice?\n\nThanks in advance!",

That’s their money, let them decide how they want to spend it. The rest depends on the answer. \n\nIf that junior is more important that the company business, users and stakeholders - it all gets into the management space, not technical space. The management is the whole process on its own, so I wouldn’t limit myself by obvious advices like “uh-oh you should listen them“ but apply something useful. These day I would suggest two good sources on management: Crucial Accountability for the companies more focused on a slow pace of correction and who can affords months to fix behavior or Radical Candor for the organization that needs to move fast. \n\nOtherwise what I see is lack of kind of “coaching contract“ established upfront in this relationships. Seems like there are a lot of unspoken assumptions on the both sides and these assumptions aren’t appear to be compatible. It is still good point to have open conversation on assumptions, even very evident, like “functional requirements must be fulfilled and internal coding standards must be obeyed” or “the information about how we work shared not to discuss, but to learn and apply”.

Instead, you need to tell him \"I cannot review your PR, because I need you to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ first\" or even review his PR and explain that it isn't tied to any real issue or need - or that it's low quality or whatever. Honestly, I'm not even sure what the problem is from reading this. I trust that his PR wasn't high quality, based on everything else you said, but there's nothing here to go by. Having this documented makes it easier to escalate if there is a problem and it gives him a chance to correct the issue.\n* When he approved the PRs without reviewing them - this one is hard to document. You could have a meeting with him to go over the PRs with you together and then document what happened. If it's clear he didn't actually review the PRs tell him not to approve them blindly, and follow up in an email with the contents of what was discussed and agreed upon in the discussion. If he refuses to talk to you, document and escalate that, too. If he isn't the one to review those PRs, that could also be a process/culture issue in the company that needs to be addressed, instead.\n* When he criticized your work, get him to specify which areas need clarification and what the common approach would have been to those issues. Force him to clarify his position. Tell him we all want the system to be easier to understand and modify, but we can't do that if he pushes back on designs without sharing his experience or tangible criticisms. That instead of shutting down discussion, he needs ask clarifying questions so we can move forward together as a team.\n\nThat said, I relate to your story. I've had a few juniors try to worm their way out of their responsibilities like this, and it took a few times for me to learn how to handle it. The best way to hold people and escalate is to be clear about your expectations, especially when they screw up. Leave a clear paper trail of the expectations you establish and their response to those. Then escalate when they refuse to comply.\n\nYou've got to take the emotion and subjectivity out of it and make it objective so that someone can say: \"This employee was fired because they were unwilling or unable to follow the process / guidelines which were clearly documented for them.\"",

Make sure they answer the question about how they would have handled the situation.

It takes a significant amount of your time, because it’s another big problem to solve. How you dealt with it was already acceptable, but it’s not to craft level. Just like you’d submit code that’s ok, but not craft. It’s true that human problems like this are a two-way street, but you have way more lever than you think. \n\nPersonally, when I’m assigned to mentor someone, just like studying codebase and all, I prepare a directory and markdown about them. I study them, document them, learn their strengths and weaknesses, proactively meet with them other than pair programming, document their personality and the boundary of failures. You’ve noticed problems, but they’re scattered and presented more like a rant. As you said, you need a plan of attack. \n\nThe same way that there’s documentation about the personality and technical capabilities of the junior, I’d create a roadmap of growth. Your roadmap could include every PR that he submits has to go through you. You would lay out why you’d like a thorough review on every one of these, at least when it’s a system you own, things include prevent code breakages and to facilitate better review process, and help him learn better on PR culture. You could also include things like more targeted PRs that he needs to test, even prepare some review templates to start with. I’d get buy-ins because my plan usually looks like I notice the human problems, I’m not emotional about it, objectively these are the things that need to get done, or need to be enforced by his manager, to help him grow. My first meet with the junior would’ve also included these discussions with them; while it’s collaborative, I would ask how they think of the codebase, what’s their career goal, what are the areas of interests and things they are learning about. I’d ask what they think they’re good at etc (as opposed to my own observation, good to see how delulu some are in documentation). \n\nAll of these take up significant of my time, but it’s part of mentorship. It’s also helpful to communicate/negotiate with the managers that, because of the plan of attack and all, this is where I’m spending my time and how. This way, it really can be communicated in a way that is basically the same as “do you want me to work on this feature/system more or that”. \n\nI haven’t gotten tons of mentorship opportunities, but the two I had were manageable as a result. One of them very arrogant, and really took a lot of my time, but it’s something I communicated and negotiated, and before I left the company, the junior expressed he really learnt a lot and wished there were more time. \n\nAh, I will say, since I’m Asian from Asia, I’ve been learning to balance the humbleness mindset and required amount of assertiveness. \n\nHope this helps.",

Unfortunately there are some who have this attitude that will take conversations like this as a personal attack or a way to belittle them, so having a paper trail to cover yourself if this comes up is always a good idea.\n\nIf this continues, then I would arrange a meeting with their manager, yourself and them. This is basically you still being in control of the situation but bringing the manager in as the next step is for the manager to deal with, this also gives you another person in the room and this discussion should be along the lines of \"what you are doing now is not how we do things, you need to pull your head out of your ass.\"\n\nBeyond this point it is out of your hands and the manager needs to take over and deal with the situation.\n\nIn terms of your concern about \"I couldn't manage the situation\", I would say that a big part of managing the situation is knowing when to escalate a situation. If in your position you are purely a mentor who can coach and guide, but that is the extent of your \"hard authority\" then trying to reach them via these tools is all you can really do. I'd say so long as you can demonstrate you've leveraged all the tools available to you to solve the problem you should be ok.",

Outside of that , I don't really know that there is a long-term speed up. People have to be incredibly disciplined to work with AI assistance in a way that they still understand the code base. Lack of understanding means velocity will slow down over time. \n\n\nShow them the problems from AI generated code. And apply to other jobs.

Or from the arse of a manager?\n\nIf you take all the time you spend in a week, and you measure it to such detail that you are differentiating between \"typing code out when I know exactly what you want\" and everything else, including other types of software development, you'll find that the time you spend knowing exactly what you want and coding it is a really small % of your time. Even if you code 100% of the time, I think it's maybe 20% of that.\n\nI think this is tricking people? When you do side projects this % is way higher, because you're building it for yourself, so there are no expectations of how it works. You can elide edge cases by not caring about them, you can renegotiate what you consider mergable because it's just you. You can just take the first thing Claude returns because of this.\n\nSo I can be really productive on side projects at home, where I simply can't be at work. AI at work makes me, idk, in aggregate over a month, like 2% faster? \n\nDon't get me wrong: there are **blocks** of time where it makes you way faster. Eg today I had to quickly knock out some scripts to debug a prod issue. It made something that would have taken 15min take 30 seconds. But I'm not 30x faster all the time, I'm 30x faster for 30 seconds.",

Hacker News works partly because discussion beats authorship, and the bar is social rather than formal.\n\nIt might also be cultural.

Do you still read technical articles? You aren't the only one, and if you're a compelling writer, have something interesting to say, or did something interesting, people will want to read what you, the human, wrote. This isn't what people use LLMs for - instead they're used (especially for technical things) to get broad overviews of concepts, do research tasks (in which case they do link back to their sources), or ask specific questions that are usually covered in documentation.\n\nSo to make your work worth reading, you have to think about how people are using LLMs and fulfill the niches they can't. This may mean higher effort work, more unique content, or something else, but overall it raises the bar for what you write.\n\nOn the other hand, you have to think about why you're writing. To me, it doesn't really matter whether bots are scraping my content for AI or anything else. I write first for me, then for my audience, whatever it is. Some writers even make versions of their work more accessible for AI so that their ideas get out there or users can better query the work directly.",

So, down here people grouped themselves into different social media - like pikabu and habr and \"underground internet\". In the west these blogs were a thing,so they never centralised into one bug platform.\n\n\nIn Ukraine we have an idiosyncratic platform called Dou - it is more akin to news media for IT industry, but also quite a lot of habr-style technical posts.

Secondly, we have draconian employment contracts where we are forbidden to discuss the work we do. I do a lot of amazing things but only my team and direct line of management knows.

What is tagging? where are the images? how can they check project state? without this genre of information, they will forever be wary of breaking something.\n\nlow confidence devs are paralyzed in an environment they can't navigate. it's impossible to focus on problem-solving when you can't move or orient yourself. \n\nthe best way to get them familiar with these is to show them what they are and what you can do with them in zero-stakes scenarios. Ask them to find things. ask them to check if a trigger in the db exists. ask them to enter a container for secrets or find a function in the repo based on what its name could be. ask them to make a docker image from code in a specific branch. just focus on tasks that have them interacting with a dev env harmlessly until they can do things without needing to ask you how. \n\neven if they still need to google it a month later, they will at least know that they are able to manipulate their environment with a bit of work, and that goes a huge way toward autonomy.\n\nto help speed up their progress in memorizing things however, it can help to export some aliases with them in their *shrc\n\nwork with them on this. have them suggest things they struggle to remember, or things they want to do more easily, and get some basic macros built out. \n\nunfortunately, all that is the easy part.\n\nlow confidence devs will languish here at the stage of 'i can move now' without ever taking these steps further or combining them. they will never trust that these steps can be left to work on their own or automated or chained or piped. They need to see a feedback cycle in action. You need to give them a problem that will hammer their ability to make a change, push it up, see the effect, and then force them to make another change based on the feedback. \n\nI recommend nomenclature updates for this. changing names of functions, classes, variables, etc., in our case, especially useful when they run into .proto, where it isn't as simple as just changing the name. more generically, nomenclature updates that hit external APIs can be a nice lesson in stakeholder management. \n\nnomenclature updates are fairly valuable and fairly low stakes. they're easy to match parity with prod, they make the codebase more understandable for humans and ai, and they touch wide swaths of the codebase. people also tend to feel ownership over things they name, and it can be a great way to get the dev further invested.\n\nhave them follow every step as visually as possible. generic k8s example, they make a change, they save it, they run tests, they commit. head to whatever is running CI: image builds. head to dev env. deploy new image. trigger smoke tests. watch for green. remote debug to see new name in action. check error logs. error? back to code, make change, repeat. hit regression button when you're not spotting easy errors, head to whatever is running your regressions and watch what it's doing. look at logs as regression runs. jot errors down for repeat.\n\nwork on similar exercises as the dev becomes more confident. this is not your or their failing -- they were never supposed to be in this position.\n\nalso, this is all fairly tedious work and it will quickly become apparent if they're trying to take you for a ride anyways, because it's nearly impossible to not learn at this level of direct feedback unless you're actively not engaging with it. I have worked with extremely unintelligent developers on processes to keep them productive; all you need is motivation, the willingness to try, and the courage to ask for direction.",

You need to be having this conversation with their manager first and foremost. Come at it from a perspective of genuinely trying to do the best thing for the company and everyone involved’s career: that due to the intense deadlines you have been put under, you are finding it difficult to have enough time to both mentor this junior engineer and accomplish your assigned workload.\n\nYou may have concerns about the ability of the junior engineer can ever improve, but you also need to consider the possibility that the problem is you, not them. That is, that your teaching style does not resonate with the junior engineer, and given the tine pressure you are under, you are not able to both alter/improve your mentoring ability while simultaneously keeping up with the non-mentoring workload you have. It’s ok, it happens, not every teacher is the right teacher for every student. But you need to be open to that being a possibility, and come at this from a humble place of just trying to set everyone up for success as best you can. Avoid adopting an attitude where it seems like you think you are the ultimate arbiter on if someone can hack it or not.\n\nPresuming you share a manger, this conversation should then move on to how to best handle this situation: either reducing your world load so you can focus more on mentorship, or looking to assign someone else to mentor the junior engineer so that you can focus more on non-mentorship tasks.\n\nIf you have a good relationship with your manager, this should also result in an honest conversation about _why_ the junior engineer isn’t improving, which will help the manager understand if it is likely that the junior engineer might improve under different circumstances, or if they really don’t have the chops to ever make the grade.\n\nFinally, leave any implied assumptions of nepotism out of this. Going anywhere near that is only going to hurt you, not help you. If it is nepotism, you’ll just make yourself the bad guy for calling it out and you will get burned. If it isn’t nepotism, it will not look favorably on you that you immediately jumped to that conclusion instead of honestly introspecting on where _you_ may have been failing them as their mentor, and you’ll get burned.

An organization doesn't exist in a vacuum but it's something that revolves around people - and the C-suite people are a quite relevant portion of that.

Over time we moved to RPM packages, then Docker and Kubernetes. I learned the importance of immutable artifacts, configuration management, and overall the importance of making systems easy to reason about, and the value of homogeneity, immutability and predictability. \n\nI learned about trade-offs in software engineering. Now if I am interviewing an L4 or L5 candidate, I always focus on whether they understand tradeoffs in their designs.  There is never 1 “best” way to do things, you always need to understand what goals you are trying to optimize, and what needs to be given up in order to satisfy them. \n\nUsing fair queuing is important to prevent hot users from crowding out smaller users. \n\nThe value (and drawbacks) of asynchronous systems.  If your entire system is synchronous, it's easier to understand, but eventually you will hit a scaling limit. Synchronicity is slow, and coordination always reduces the speed of a system.\n\nBackpressure and providing congestion signals to upstream callers.  Learning about congestion control algorithms that do not require coordination like AIMD or CoDel which can help congested flows perform optimally.  Being explicit about providing back-pressure, otherwise things will fail in a way that is unpredictable or out of your control.\n\nLearning how overloaded systems in general do not operate efficiently, you want to keep utilization well below 100%. \n\nCAP theorem is real, many times we were forced to make that trade whether we liked it or not.\n\nAt-least-once vs at-most-once delivery, and being cognizant of the choice you are making there.\n\nCellular system design, and being able to route traffic volume between cells for failover or load testing purposes. \n\nThat's a lot of what I could write down off the top of my head in a few minutes.  None of these are specific to any technologies.  Over the course of a 20 year career you just learn to go with the flow technology-wise. Many times the technology choices are made above your pay grade without your input.  If you are lucky, you get to choose.",

Our product at this point is in the 1,000+ microservices, which helps at scale because most services are tasked with doing this small chunk of work really fast.\n\n1) No, while ideally the producer does a best effort on maintaining order per partition (not per topic). Our data can be visualized as time series data, we care about some device working (being online basically) and when was the last time we saw it. If an event arrives and we have seen the device more recently, then at persist time the event is dropped. \n\n2) Fortunately no, again we are lucky here and can keep things simple. If a batch of events is dropped, we can tolerate it. It’s not ideal, specially for devices with low activity, but at the end of the day it’s a device health system and the data itself is not critical. \n\nWe keep events in memory after consumption from the Kafka topic, our biggest problems would be OOM Kills or pod restarts. Good monitoring prevents the first one, or at least catches it while happening and alerts us to scale the application limits while we debug the root cause and the second one is mitigated by taints on the pods that schedule them as critical backend pods which means they don’t restart unless absolutely needed. In that case the application shuts down cleanly and we can persist whatever is in mem before terminating.",

Still at high scale now single server cannot handle added nginx as load balancer. I felt database as bottle neck where one database can’t push more. Now I have two database and on get I just query two database to show total counter. \n\nLater I added redis to buffer db writes so first write goes to redis which super fast then every 5 sec there will be sync. \n\nSo I learned a lot and trade offs.

You must design as if you are going to be woken up at 3 am to fix it.\n\nThis is hard to imagine when it has never happened to you.  So you seek it only as an abstract risk.  \n\nSo my recommendation is to think in failure modes.  Not only what a system can do, but how can it fail? And if it does fail, how do we recover?

When I was in college I had to take either a compiler class or a distributed computing class, or I believe something else I no longer recall but seemed dumb. There were two compilers instructors depending on what semester you took. Some of my friends were complaining about how one of the instructors was an ass and how the other class was a disaster (compiler classes constantly build on last week’s homework and if you’re over optimistic on what juniors can accomplish it came off the rails). Eventually I heard he offered an A+ to anyone who got all the way to the end of the project. \n\nSo I took the distributed computing class, which became my second favorite class in my entire education. I didn’t talk to people about this until recently and the number of, “wait you guys had a semirequired Distributed Computing class? We didn’t even have it as an elective” responses I got was shocking. \n\nNot so shocking with people my age. The Web was still new then. But people with ten years experience - who graduated after the Internet ate everything and the Cloud was the new hotness. \n\nLike what the fuck is going on at colleges??",

Some of these being POCing new projects, revamping processes, driving cultural improvements. I’m excited to have such an opportunity, but I’m realizing that in the industry this is typically expected of Staff level engineers with about double my YOE. I’m also hitting a bit of a wall, where the teams I’m working with look to me as an extra pair of hands, so I either don’t have enough time to work stories or work team/dept level improvements.\n\nSo similarly to the title, how did you guys grow into the IC role? How did you guys skill up for organizational needs, how do you ensure you’re performant when working many initiatives across teams? What were some of your core learnings when navigating this transition in responsibilities?",

You’re not implementing the changes or plugging holes (sometimes yes this might be the case), you’re valued for looking at it at a higher degree and getting your other counter parts (product, infra, data, etc) aligned without your skip. Your team is the one you entrust to actually get it done, and you oversee that to make sure it’s happening. THEN, if you see your team still needs a hand or there’s a skill gap, jump in to get the initiative done.\n\n\nI would also have a frank discussion with your skip about leveling because you will resent thinking you’re operating levels ahead and not actually progressing with the title/promotions.",

Part of it is everyone's busy so review gets deprioritized, part of it is codebase complexity meaning understanding the impact of changes requires significant context that takes time to load. Assigning dedicated reviewers just creates bottlenecks when those people are unavailable, and the async nature makes it worse where someone leaves feedback, the author addresses it 8 hours later, then the reviewer doesn't see updates until the next day which stretches everything out. The other thing is review feedback being subjective style stuff rather than actual bugs, so there's multiple rounds of back-and-forth over variable naming or formatting which seems like a waste of time but people have opinions about it. Some prs apparently sit for a week before merging which is pretty absurd for any company trying to move fast, and pair programming helps for critical stuff but it's exhausting and doesn't scale…. what approaches actually work for keeping review quick without it becoming rubber-stamping where people just approve without really looking?",

          "text": "Your org needs a style guide.\n\nYou mention in your post more than once that there are a bunch of back'n'forths on subjective issues. The style guide should specify enough detail that it should resolve pretty much all of these subject issues by taking a stance, not because it's a better or worse way of doing it, but because consistency across the entire codebase is better than inconsistency, even if the style guide chooses the worse option. Or, in cases where inconsistency has little to no cost (or even benefit), then it should clearly state that coders should either defer to local style (meaning that style should conform to whatever is the prevailing way in that file, module, or team), or that it really doesn't matter and reviewers that raise it should be redirected to take it up with the style guide instead of the code author.\n\nThe second thing is that your org needs an SLA around code reviews. For changes that total less than 100 lines touched, < 4h, for changes greater than 100 lines, 8h per 500 lines of code added/changed/deleted. Whatever the SLA is, set up a dashboard and display everyone's last 30d of code review activity.\n\nThe problem your org likely has is that PRs are too big. Changes should be split into the smallest cohesive set of changes possible, and the above SLA will encourage everyone to keep their PRs under 100 lines if at all possible. At the very least, people will be encouraged to collect bigger changes that are conceptually weighty into PRs that require more review attention instead of clubbing together a ton of little, independent things into the same PR.\n\nYour issue tracker should also allow issues to be tagged with specific PRs. The way to keep all of this organized is to create a tracking issue for each task (preferably that belongs to a parent issue for each project an individual owns). Then individual issues can track conceptual sub-tasks and accumulate tags for the set of little PRs that contribute to changes. This seems like a lot of bookkeeping, but if your tooling is good enough to handle this, it has tons of benefits. It becomes easy to track down issues when a CL needs to be rolled back, it creates a fine-grained view of where things are for task tracking, and it makes it very easy to substantiate your contributions in your self-eval at perf time.\n\nI actually keep a running self-eval doc. I book fifteen minutes after lunch every Friday which I allocate to updating that doc with detailed links to what I'm working on and notes to myself. When self-eval time comes it's pretty much a cut'n'paste for me because I've been keeping it all year long, so it's easy to adapt into whatever format is requested.",

Larger PRs have the potential to generate more comments, and for it to take you longer to address those comments.\n\nRe variable naming and other subjective things - this is an indication that other people aren't finding your code as easy to read as it could be.

My experience working with AI coding agents so far has been they are both more capable than the engineers say, and less capable than the PMs/executives think. \n\nI am a mobile engineer by background, about ~15 YoE at this point and have worked professionally in about every space except front end web. I am also late to the AI game. I have been in the \"this cannot build scalable, maintainable code\" camp for years. But in the last 2 months I've gotten access to more or less arbitrary amounts of Claude. \n\nWhat I've found is, in short, it is not very capable of thinking. But it's very capable of implementing. And that itself is a major capability. \n\nI'm used to working in code base with very rigid architecture patterns derived from foundational team libraries. High degrees of decoupling, very perspective in how state and data flow are managed. These patterns were developed to handle introducing new grads into our code base and not have them immediately knock over prod / break main and make 500+ developers waste their time.\n\nWith those requirements both enforced by the compiler and the basics of the good practices guide dropped into CLAUDE.md, I've found that it does an excellent job working inside that well defined box. The blast radius of its mistakes is small, and the scope of the changes is associatively equally small. \n\nIt certainly is not \"write me an app\". But it can be \"write me this state inside this state machine that makes this call to this service and then maps the output into a new view model instance consumed by the renderer\" and it can handle that very well. \n\nReduces the implementation time once I've decided what needs to be done by from ~ an hour to 5 minutes, scaling at about that rate. I do legitimately feel about 500% more productive than I was previously. \n\nPro-AI people, is this the use case you imagine? Do you think I'm handicapping myself not giving it larger scope? \n\nAnti-AI people, am I deluding myself? What do you think the invisible impacts will be that I'm not anticipating? ",

Transitioning to AI agents feels extremely similar to that.\n\nEvery time you start a new agent, you effectively have to onboard it. It can read all of your docs in seconds, but it can only hold so much context in memory at one time. So you have to be judicious about how much responsibility to give it, how much information it needs to fulfill that responsibility, and how to efficiently present that information without overwhelming its memory.\n\nThe more agents you onboard, the more you tasks can get done, but that shifts your burden from writing code to reading and reviewing it. The better you are about establishing and enforcing clear patterns, the easier that will be.\n\nIf you structure your applications so that all changes flow through a few common files, you're going to have to resolve a lot of conflicts whenever you have work being done in parallel. If it's structured so that different features live in different files, you're going to have a much easier time.\n\nIn so many ways, it feels so similar. It all relies on the same fundamentals, just in slightly different ways. So I think the big change is that AI is going to force all engineers to upskill in architecture and leadership earlier in their careers than they had to before.",

                  "text": "Yes and no. The obvious point of comparison is compilers, since they translate higher level more human-oriented language to something closer to what actually executes on the hardware. If you're an early adopter, there's a significant advantage to being familiar with the compiler's target language, so you can deal with bugs or optimize better. But as they get more battle-tested, that advantage diminishes until the compiler is so good that there's almost no benefit to knowing the target it compiles down to.\n\nThe big difference is that compilers are deterministic and LLMs are probabilistic. Given the same C code, the compiler will output the same assembly every time, and it will be better than anything 99.9% of human programmers could ever write by hand. The LLM will give you something different every time, so there will always be value in being able to ensure that you got one of the better outputs.\n\nSo as LLMs get better at generating code, I think it will be easier to get away with not understanding the code and blindly trusting it. But we'll never be able to trust them as far as we can trust compilers, because they're non-deterministic. I think it will be similar to how you can usually get away with using an ORM without knowing SQL, but every once in a while you'll get bit by something like an N+1 query that you could have easily avoided if you knew how it translates to SQL.",

You think through it, analyze, debug, etc. AI doesn’t take care of those parts. If you are building a feature that is super close to the existing one and you really don’t care about thinking, you may as well copy code and update config. That is not much if any slower than AI doing it. And if feature is significantly different then AI will need quite a bit of oversight.

How are you handling it? It seems so overwhelming and I can't keep all the changes in my head at the same time.\n\nAs an example, one of my coworkers used AI and in a few hours built a custom http server metaframework to allow exposing arbitrary internal library function calls over the network to enable us to split off parts of our application into services. But figuring out how to actually connect any of my work to it and understand how it's configured gives me a migraine. I can't ask for help because nobody on the team really knows how it works or what technologies it uses under the hood, and needing to ask and look manually instead of getting AI to do it means I'm a bad dev. It's gotten to the point where I dread interacting with any new code. How do you deal with the volume of stuff you have to understand on a daily basis?",

I'm a crotchety oldtimer who's coming around to _some_ primarily \"AI\" driven practices.\n\n\nThe truth is the most boring parts of programming really are easily solved with \"AI\", and most of programming is really boring.\n\n\nBut there's just SO MUCH configuration and finetuning and picking and choosing workflows and learning new forms of technical deligence to make the output from \"AI\" consistently decent that it ends up feeling like learning a really niche, error-prone programming language through trial and error.\n\n\nCombine that with the fact that the rabid vibecoding hype makes it almost impossible to take any of it seriously and it's no wonder so many of us are (rightfully) so negative and annoyed by it all.\n\n\nBut I've come to the conclusion that it would be career suicide to not apply your tech savvy to find ways to leverage \"AI\". There are ways to deliver BETTER solutions faster. It's just painful as fuck to get to that point and it sucks the joy out of coding (for me personally - vibecoders seem to love it).\n\n\nI despise the impact \"AI\" is having on the world. I wish it could have waited another 10 or so years for me to semiretire, but unfortunately it's here. And it's mostly bullshit. But there's enough value there that it's worth learning to exploit it as much as responsibly possible.\n\n\nThat's my super vague old man shouting at the clouds 2c for you...",

I think with AI, it's like 2 hour AI \"plan mode\" that generates a spec to execute, 5 minutes of coding, 1 hour of testing, and 2 hours of self human code review just so I can understand the code myself, then whatever time for AI and peer code review.

We should all be 'managers' with fleets of AI agent junior devs, and in the same way you wouldn't read every line every junior dev coded you shouldn't read every line your AI agents make, and if you had a question for a junior about strategy you would ask them instead of diving in to look at the implementation.\n\nThe problem I have is that the tooling lies, you can ask the AI \"why did you do X\" and get something completely wrong out, but I seem to be the only one who cares.",

Or when garbage collectors came around and we stopped memory management. People complained about compilers generating inefficient code, there was a lot of skepticism. Garbage collectors are STILL not 100% always more efficient than doing it by hand. \n\nBut the results mattered more. Portability, scalability, saving on human hours, etc. So people iterated on these optimizations and made them more and more robust over time. Nowdays I don't think there's much of a gap left where you would do better than compilers by hand. As in, most programmers rarely care about what's going on under the hood anymore. The same is likely to happen with AI. The code that is written will just go under the hood and we will likely stop caring about them. Smart people will figure out what kind of guardrails to put in, what kind of automated processes to put into place to get things to a state where it won't matter whether the code is clean or human readable at all. \n\nWhat you're seeing is just the transitionary state...there will be confusion...there will be inertia to hold on to the old ways...it will be hard to \"let go\" of the control that writing code by hand provides. But it's best to learn the new way (based on historical evidence). The best of the new ways is probably not figured out yet, but this is transitionary. You should pace yourself and adapt to the paradigm shifts. Understanding the code is still important today but only because it's in transition and it might feel rough for now, but you can still figure out the \"good enough\" approach (ie. maybe move towards rigorously testing behavior/results rather than review every line of code, etc). Over time smarter people will make it work if the trends are to stick ie.\n\nI know there's a caveat that AI is fundamentally non-deterministic (vs compilers for eg are deterministically \"correct\"), and what I said is a bit extreme, but directionally that's the way things are headed. Code readability will likely still matter but less so and it's gonna be about where the balance ends up. It'll be a higher level of abstraction and the change will be profound, even if you can't fully treat it as a black box entirely.",

But I've been stuck in hole this company has been digging for themselves for like a decade in which they just keep writing code and it's a pain in the ass to try to convince developers to start writing test cases now.\n\nSo have you had similar experiences? I feel like there must be some way to auto generate test cases based on network traffic and database state, but I don't know where to begin. All I want is something that can run a bunch of automated Java tests without requiring like a month-long manual QA cycle that still manages to miss things.\n\nLet me know if you've brought a company out of a similar situation :]\n\nI've already tried throwing large language models at the problem with some Junior Developers, but even then it looks like it would take over 10 years of solid progress to get to a reasonable point.

Even a few coarse tests around critical paths can cut fear way down. Trying to backfill clean unit tests everywhere usually fails, but adding tests only when code changes slowly moves the culture. Auto generation rarely helps much because the hard part is deciding what behavior actually matters. Once people feel changes are safer, buy in tends to follow.",

We updated the old system to be a bit more verbose in logging, and then setup log scrapers that could capture all the inputs and outputs.\n\nWe built into the new system a way to write end to end tests, and a parser to turn the logs into inputs and assert expectations. We used Java, so we leveraged JUnit Dynamic Tests so that we could generate tests automatically from a structured test case json we put together from the logs.\n\nWe then would replay all the activity from the previous day/week and find which cases broke. The cases that broke got committed to the repo, and the passing cases deleted. This carried on for a month or two until we routinely could play an entire week without any failures.\n\nEffectively we turned the current production behaviour into BDD test cases. \n\nIt worked great, and is something that could be applied to existing systems not just rewrites.\n\nThe main thing is refactoring the application to allow you to run it up in a mode that allows for deterministic tests like this.

When I worked with them for a few months in 2020, the code base was 8 years old, had zero unit test coverage, and was full of spaghetti.  After a few weeks of wrestling with it, I decided to go all in on testing and ensure that all work I did was 100% covered by unit tests.\n\nWell, one of my first bug fixes involved fixing a 800-line function inside a 12,000-line file.  There was a lot of spaghetti and a lot of dependencies going on, and I had to do a bit of surgery so that I could mock things.  Long story short, it took me days to get it into a testable state, I introduced a few bugs along the way, and then I was banned from further experiments in testing.  The PR that introduced the tests sat abandoned and was finally closed 4 years after I left.\n\nFast-forward to 2026 and there's still zero test coverage, and last week I revisited the scene of the crime - the function is now 1400 lines long and the file is 14,000 lines.  I'm taking a more realistic approach of trying to write as much as possible of what I change inside new files/classes that can be more easily tested.  At the moment I'm working on a new integration with Microsoft Graph API so that's fairly easy to keep out of the spaghetti zone.  For my 5% time I also have three ideas for separating bits of logic out of the 1,400 line function into smaller, more testable classes.\n\nI don't anticipate progress to be fast, and at this stage I don't anticipate that either of the other devs who work on the code base are going to join me.  Neither of them know anything about testing, and it would be very difficult for them to learn on code that is very poorly factored for testing.  If I can build up a good set of examples of testable code, and figure out a couple of the refactoring challenges, hopefully it would be more approachable for them to learn.",

Budget for the extra time, of course, but mandate everyone do it.\n\nIf there's no time to write unit tests that cover the entire thing touched, then new tests should at least cover whatever functionality changed, and the author needs to file an issue against themselves to finish the unit test for the rest of that file within some fixed timeframe. You won't be able to practically use AI to generate meaningful unit tests, but if you disperse the work and the policy is to write them on a go-forward basis, then AI should be very helpful.\n\nMake sure all affected unit test suites pass before code is allowed to commit, and ideally you can start working toward a CI/CD pipeline that begins by setting up some continuous test servers that can tell you what the last green build is.\n\nBut unit tests will not suffice, not nearly. You should also create e2e tests that cover the basic functionality of the app. Just nail down the major user flows through the system, and make sure those are run as part of the deployment to every environment.\n\nFrom there, you can start writing integration and functional tests that exist in the middle space. The smaller the test, the more functionality it should cover. e2e tests should only verify major user paths through the system, integration and functional tests should try to hit the 80/20 rule, and unit test coverage at the lowest level should cover pretty much everything (that's the goal, obv you're pretty far away from that).\n\nYou should also invest some time in monitoring progress. Set up some publicly visible dashboards on TVs that display team progress toward test coverage, and for each team they should easily be able to display metrics for each team member. Also do some monitoring on the functional side. Publish some dashboards about code quality in production and chart progress by following how improved code quality reduces production issues. Put up a dashboard that shows test failure rates across the different environments … each test failure caught in a nonprod env is a production issue prevented. Over time, failures should migrate toward the developer.",

      "text": "TL;DR: My company wants me to deliver what was scoped as a 3person backend project in the same timeframe, but alone using AI tools and I’m struggling.\n\nI work as a backend developer at a software company that builds turnkey applications for clients. Recently we signed a deal with a client for a finance app. The backend effort was originally planned as 3 devs over 3 months. The budget is agreed with the client, so that part is fine.\n\nBut my company is now insisting that I deliver the same work in the same time, completely on my own, with using ai. They’re very serious about it. I pushed back a lot at first, but given the market, I realized pushing too hard probably won’t help me, so I reluctantly accepted.\n\nI’m not new to ai tools I try to use them a lot which is probably why they picked me. But building a project from scratch like this with AI feels almost impossible. The app is a finance product that includes money transfers, and there are a lot of security and idempotency concerns I have to handle.\n\nI’m trying to keep the AI’s output in very small chunks and review everything, but I’m under huge time pressure. If I keep working like this, I’m sure it won’t be finished on time. When I try to go faster, I’m afraid I’ll end up with parts of the system where I don’t really understand what the AI produced and in a finance app, that feels risky.\n\nThis also made me wonder if this is what working as a developer is going to look like in the near futureconstantly being expected to do “3 people’s work” solo with AI. Maybe I’m just struggling, maybe others are doing it fine. If anyone here works like this, I’d really like to hear your advice.\n\nDo you think this is a temporary phase, or is this the new normal?",

Don't get sucked into mind games.\n\nI am personally stubborn enough to lose a job over this (this hasn't actually happened yet though, I've chosen most employers wisely i guess), but I suspect this advice might apply even if you're not.

They have structured definitions, if you have samples, user manual you should expect very good implementations one shot, stripe is its own story but our friends in r/vibecoding have some tips around that. If you have indempotency and other constraints it is easier to build a loop that produces near production ready code. \n\nYou must use tools like claude code, codex or opencode that operates over the whole source code, and a good agentic model, so you can feed it entire features, you already have a base and you can ask to generate the code that follows the same architecture/patterns as your current code. You might also have your handcoded segments that you absolutely want to preserve and your base.\n\nAI is particulary useful for financial code, if you have input <-> expected result and a sketch of the algorithm you want to use, it is easy to generate tests that verify precisely.\n\nTry to follow your usual workflow, design the databse, create the model, the controllers and the frontend for example, experiment with big tasks, subdivide in phases, use plan mode. use e2e tests to verify the application.\n\n\\--------------\n\nAt the end of the exercise you will have VERY FAST a large part of the application but buggy as hell, the reality is that you will need the same 3 months and the same 3 devs, one vibe coding and the other two doing qa and solving bugs. Since it is a new  process you might need  even more time since the bugs the AI generate are always very strange and hard to spot, and some code must be written manually.\n\nYou are working with experimental technology that is very imperfect, you should talk to your boss about the expectations and risks, and have two dev/test by monday, make it very clear that the testing cycle is non negotiable and longer than traditional development. If (when) the project fails it is because the manager didnt put enough resources, not because of you. \n\nIn my experience financial algorithms even with known input/output and enough samples should be made manually, you really need a wingman for this project, you will be fighting context rot and lobotomized models, you need a person dedicated to make sure the financial data is OK.  \n\\-----------\n\nIn conclusion you should give the AI a chance, use codex/claude (or kimi/minimax) + opencode, the project will most likely require MORE resources than a normal project, expected since it is an experiment and will take 2x the amount of testing.",

One group was encouraged to use AI tools, and the control group was not allowed to use them. They were given the same tasks.\n\nThe outcome was surprising for both sides of the argument. The team with the AI tools was able to deliver new features something like 30% faster. There was no difference between the two groups in code quality, or time to perform maintenance tasks.\n\nObviously, this result flies in the faces of any AI companies claiming 10x (or even 2x) velocities. On the other hand, it demonstrate value when the AI tool is guided by competent developers.\n\nThe real question is though, if 30% gains for new features are what we can realistically expect, are the costs of training and inference really justified?\n\nAnother impressive headline out there is that someone let 16 agents loose to build a new C compiler in two weeks. It did accomplish the goal, but if you read past the headlines the story is far more nuanced than the marketers and CEO’s would have you believe.\n\nThe agents were guided with a very heavy hand, and were allowed to use GCC and other existing test suites to validate the product. The agents needed almost constant guidance and correction by a human. The result, while technically a passing C compiler, produced far worse object code than even GCC with all optimizations disabled. The linker is also was buggy. There were also most likely hundreds or thousands of C compilers in its training data, so this wasn’t the same sort of task that most organizations are going to be asking it to do. Most companies build bespoke software when free software isn’t available, and COTS software is too expensive or doesn’t meet their needs, i.e. the example solution isn’t already in the training data.\n\nAnd they burned $20,000 USD worth of tokens. In two weeks. If you gave four CS grads $5,000 USD each and asked them to give you a C compiler in two weeks, they’d probably be able to build you a low quality C compiler.",

I found it was exhausting trying to review thousands of lines of code carefully over a sustained period of time. I think I was probably doing the work of 2-3 people, so I think it's possible to do it. Just keep the PRs as small as you can so that it's always clear what exactly you're trying to achieve. Once you start having larger PRs with thousands of lines of code, it becomes impossible to maintain quality control. I would recommend writing E2E tests and preferring it to unit tests, and don't try to make the tests comprehensive. It can become bloated and lose its effectiveness if you're just churning out giant test files. It's better to carefully plan what you think needs to be tested the most and make sure those areas are covered well. Another thing which I think can be very helpful, is to spend a good amount of time in the planning phase. If you can research and write up good technical documentation -- even if it takes days -- you can use those as living documents that you can load into new sessions, and have Claude Code keep them up to date. If you maintain a well-planned tech spec, it can easily generate Jira stories and tasks for you and save you a lot of administrative headache.",

And judgment doesn't scale 3x just because you have faster typing.\n\nTrust me - I'm at a licensed fintech company and have seen over the last 10 years many companies go bust because RBI comes knocking and asks you to just shutdown. When you're dealing with money, the accountability layer isn't optional. The parts you \"don't really understand\" become exactly the parts regulators or security audits find.\n\nWhat your company is betting on: AI writes code fast, so 1 person = 3 people.\n\nWhat they're missing: The bottleneck was never typing speed. It's understanding what you're building, catching the bugs before production, and being able to explain it when something goes wrong.\n\nThe uncomfortable answer: Document everything. Every scope assumption, every risk you flagged, every \"do it anyway\" response. If this fails, you need the paper trail showing you raised concerns. If it succeeds, you've proven you can deliver under unrealistic constraints.",

I’ve dealt with something similar. \n\nI was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm in 2020 after a urgent care nurse heard a heart murmur at a Covid test who referred me to a cardiologist who had a top doctor referral to repair my valve and replace that section of aorta. Wild year that was.\n\nTurns out a side effect of open heart surgery where the heart and lungs are bypassed by a heart and lung machine is “pump brain”. Very foggy for many months and definitely felt a dozen IQ points knocked off for a while.\n\nPersonally I switched from the high output grind to a higher level but slower paced role doing mostly design, architecture and reviews. Kept up with the development and it did get easier for me though. Now with LLM tools I find it a nice boost in productivity. I use it for areas that I’ve thought and and designed thoroughly so it’s really just saving typing time and the plug and chug. Remember to keep your doctors in the loop with what your feeling and solution it together as I’ve had to make a LOT of med changes along the way, beta blockers especially.\n\nDealing with a diagnosis like yours can weigh on you emotionally as well, even beyond the meds, so stay open to therapy, supplements, meds etc. that could help that.",

Brain fog can have all sorts of causes, and you are on meds, so this might not work, but most people are deficient in these nutrients:\n\n* Vitamin D (especially if you have dark skin, stay out of the sun, or use lots of sunblock)\n* Magnesium\n* Zinc\n* Iodine (especially if you don't eat seafood or use iodized salt)\n* B-1 and B-12 (you need all B vitamins, but these are the most important for nerve health and most likely to be depleted, and B-12 deficiency is associated with brain fog symptoms)\n\nIf you drink alcohol, just stop. It depletes your body's ability to sleep and regenerate. Getting enough sleep is a key factor in avoiding brain fog.\n\nIn general, research nutrition that promotes nerve health, mitochondrial function, and the ATP Krebs cycle. With luck, researching and focusing on nutrition might mitigate many of your symptoms. Research what nutrients your meds might be depleting, as that might provide a good place to start. Googling \"nutrition deficiencies that cause brain fog\" will confirm what I've said here and offer more detailed information. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

I’m scared no one will read it, and I’ll just publish a post and let it sit there and decay.\n\nLogically, I know I shouldn’t care about that.

But emotionally, I still feel like what I do is meaningless, like there’s no meaning in it.\n\nSo I want to ask you all: should I do it or not?

I have a huge knowledge based stored in Obsidian, but there’s no fluff in it, because, well, it is written for me: I don’t have to write the “obvious stuff”, nor does it have to cover a subject fully. I don’t have to write engagingly, because it’s a brain dump. I also don’t necessarily have to keep it up to date.\n\nWhenever I thought “oh, I’m sitting on all this, let’s just make a blog!” (and I did that numerous times)… it did not end well. I’d run into imposter syndrome, where I didn’t feel qualified enough to write about any subject. Or any post would take ages to write, because I felt it should cover the subject thoroughly (and correctly). Then it would go out of date, and I’d have to deal with updating it. All that effort, and then no visitors. Or worse: visitors leaving comments pointing out shortcomings. I found it exhausting.\n\nI am not you, you are not me. Your mileage may vary and I don’t want to discourage you; the only way to know is to try. But in a sea of “yeah you should” comments, I thought I’d share a different view. Hope it helps, good luck!",

I'll get better at it over time. \n\nAbout feeling like it's meaningless work: I get that part as well, it feels good to be appreciated when you spend hours/days working on something. I'd say first try to find what it means for you, and think of the views as the cherry on top. I shared my first post on LinkedIn and X, and I'm glad that a couple of my colleagues and friends read it. I have to admit, seeing the view climb (even if it's just from 5 to 20 :D) is a satisfying feeling I enjoy, and I'll probably share it on a couple of other platforms too.    \n  \nRegardless of the views, I'm glad I did it, and will probably continue, I can just encourage you to follow your gut and do it:)",

I want to share my knowledge and my opinion. But I’m scared. I’m scared no one will read it, and I’ll just publish a post and let it sit there and decay.\n\nDo this. When you build your site, don't enable analytics, don't enable comments, if you share it avoid looking at upvotes, shares, likes, whatever. Force yourself to write for your own benefit and develop your own voice before you let an audience (or perceived audience) dictate it.\n\n> But emotionally, I still feel like what I do is meaningless, like there’s no meaning in it.\n\nYou said in the paragraph before that you wanted to share your knowledge and your opinion. That's meaning enough. If you need more meaning, look for it intrinsically: writing solidifies your knowledge, it builds your brand, and opens opportunities down the line if you're willing to be patient and put the work in.\n\nFor me, when I started in this career (2014) I already had a long tradition of note-writing from my previous life in academia. I write primarily to learn and understand things better, and early on I built a simple website. I kept writing about interesting projects, things I learned from work projects, and more. In early 2018, I saw a call for writing samples to write for Real Python, and I got my first paid writing gig. Fast forward to 2022 or 2023, and an acquisitions editor for O'Reilly reached out about doing \"Reports\" - short sponsored ebooks (30-40 pages) on technical topics. I did 2 of them, got familiar with the staff there, and then about a year ago I pitched them on a full-length book. Guess what I'm procrastinating from writing right now?\n\n(On top of that, I'm still blogging)",

I work on a large production app, deal with architecture decisions, mentoring, deadlines, all the usual “experienced dev” stuff.\n\n\n\nLately though, I feel completely code blind.\n\n\n\nIt’s not that the problems are too hard, if anything, it’s the opposite. I look at code and my brain just… doesn’t engage. I’ll read the same lines over and over, struggle to focus, procrastinate, and feel bored or mentally exhausted way faster than I used to. The passion I had for coding, learning, digging deep, enjoying clean solutions feels muted or gone.\n\n\n\nWhat’s confusing is that:\n\n\n\n* I’m not a junior anymore struggling to keep up\n* I’m not stuck in a toxic environment\n* I’m objectively “good” at what I do\n* From the outside, everything looks fine\n\n\n\n\n\nBut internally, coding feels flat. Almost mechanical. Some days I actively avoid opening the IDE because it feels draining before I even start.\n\n\n\nI’m trying to understand whether this is:\n\n* burnout (even without obvious overload),\n* boredom after mastery,\n* lack of novelty/challenge,\n* mental fatigue from years of context switching and responsibility,\n* or just a normal phase that experienced devs go through.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave any of you hit a point where you felt bored, code-blind, or disconnected from coding itself?\n\nIf so:\n\n* What did it turn out to be?\n* Did it pass on its own?(been feeling like this for 1 -2 years now)\n* Did you change roles, expectations, or how you work?\n* Or did you rediscover the joy somehow?\n\n\n\nThanks 🙏",

Trying to deal with these AI workflow changes to everything and automated PRs from these random tickets. \n\nIve never not wanted to be in a position as much as I do currently, especially since I have a newborn at home. \n\nOkay, soapbox over, back to work!",

Good therapist can help you in in couple months if it's not a proper depression - they can be \"magic\".\n\nIt may well be that the factor is outside of work, especially if you say that the environment is great.\n\nFor me it was an ADHD spiral into nothingness after being stuck in the apartment with remote work for a year during COVID, I moved to another country for another job to feel something new. \n\nThat was probably an overreaction though :)",

First, doing it for work, you're told what to work on and have a lot less freedom to pick whatever project interests you. When you're stuck working on the same thing for several years, it gets monotonous.

I've always been a down-in-the-details kind of guy, but AI tackles the raw coding piece and you're left investing all your time in the higher-level architectural decisions. Those are kind of interesting, too, but for me they're a lot less fun.\n\nI've lately discovered I still have the coding passion and can enjoy writing stuff, but principally when I pick the project for myself.

But I now lack the primal desire to code anymore \n\nI so want to take the “Office Space” way out- not construction per-se. More like “lunch truck”. Make breakfast burritos all day. Turn my career back into my hobby as it was back in Jr High in 1978 on the Commodore PET then the Apple ][. \n\nNow if I found a billionaire sugar daddy who wanted to spin up a start up- I could assemble an Avengers team in a heartbeat- or if I won Powerball. But the grind is not fun anymore.",

What that means for any specific individual varies based on your lifestyle and regular patterns and habits.  But if you aren't getting enough novelty and enrichment and fulfillment during the course of your day or week, you are pouring from a cup that you aren't sufficiently refilling.  Eventually, it will run dry.\n\nIf this is bleeding over into other aspects of your life, it's called depression.  The line between clinical depression and severe depression isn't always easy to understand or spot, nor is the line between what you can handle on your own and what you might want or need assistance to resolve.\n\nAt the least, if your sleep schedule and physical health are otherwise good, you will want to start by changing up your schedule.  Start doing things outside your norm.  The kids have the 'touching grass' expression.  Finding outlets to experience greenery has real and measurable improvements to mental health.  If you are currently covered in snow, maybe find a trip to a botanical garden in your area.\n\nIf this is bleeding over to other aspects of life, and you feel like everything is muted and less enjoyable and you struggle to decompress and find enjoyment in things like you used to, don't wait to get help.  While I appreciate all the things I learned after months of group therapy, I do not wish the decent into darkness I experienced before I was eligible for the short list on anyone.\n\nIf this is just related to coding, then it is likely more work related.  Maybe your interests have changed.  Maybe your normal work routine is boring.  Maybe your coworkers aren't pleasant to work with.  Maybe you aren't being sufficiently challenged with rewarding ideas and problems.  Change things up.  Look for new tasks or responsibilities in your current position.  Look for something new to learn that your employer can get behind.  Or look for such outlets on your own time.  There are lots of things to try before you need to look for the exit.  Unless your job sucks and you hate it.  In which case you already know the problem and solution.",
