This seems crazy to me and I genuinely have no idea what this looks like on the ground. I'd like to be proven wrong here, so...\n\nWhat specifically does your day look like in this case? What is the nature of the work that you work on? Are you ignoring cases where it goes wrong? Or is that factored in to this mode of working? What are the downsides or upsides?\n\nOn the flipside, AI skeptics, do you use AI in any capacity? And if so, in what way?\n\nThe more detailed the answers, the better.",

AI can be poisoned and it has been poisoned before to give complete bullshit answers. Also as new tech emerges, you have to ironically jump through more hoops to find people to talk to about how to use a new library, gadget, etc since AI will often just make shit up and/or gaslight you. \n\nHowever, that all being said, stackoverflow, just before chatgpt coming out, was already turning to shit. A lot of people marking threads as duplicates for no reason, and sometimes just straight up bullying for lack of knowledge. It's like, no wonder chatgpt dusted stackoverflow, it provides a judgement free zone where you can just say the most wrong thing possible and maybe get corrected.  \n\nBut stress on \"maybe get corrected\", because I've had juniors confidently say incredibly wrong things because chatgpt told them the right information for the wrong question.

To put it another way, let’s say I’m about to start working on a feature or pipeline or whatever code artifact, if I know in my head exactly what the code needs to do, how it needs to be structured and how to test it, you best believe I’m using Claude to implement it for me and saving that time. But if I’m not sure what I need to build myself, it’s a huge mistake to ask Claude to figure out the “what” while implementing the “how”.

Yes, moving fast with code gen can obviously bring on some unintended consequences for the code base.  With that being said, there are a lot of really smart people that are actively working on building extremely tight guard rails to prevent too much drift.  This is no different than how we build systems now, and how we integrate juniors into the stack - absolute control via the CI/CD pipeline, test suites, and coding standards.\n\nI think the silver lining here is that you will always need quality engineers who pride themselves on the minutia of scaling a system and keeping it secure.  But that doesn't remove the amplification that AI can give you while you are getting there.  In the next 5 years, I think we'll see a large percentage of the stack being written by AI, which will then be guided and parented by a core team of engineers who work DEEPLY on hardening the system as it balloons.",

No. The ai tool is still LLM based, so the generated code can (and likely will) contain subtle bugs. \n\nWhat's worse tho is that unless you create tiny apps that fit in 1 file, your code lives inside a bigger project, a larger codebase. Your 'new feature' likely works together with a lot of functionality already there. Adding new features in codebases like that takes more effort than just generating code for just that feature; changes ripple through.

However backend systems, game engines, complicated desktop apps... the picture is completely different there. Example: for my .NET ORM (LLBLGen Pro) I worked for more than a year full time on the Linq provider (which converts ASTs into command trees which are then used to generate SQL. The ASTs are produced by the C#/VB.NET compilers by generating code that builds them at *runtime* and are called Expression trees, so they exist at runtime). There wasn't (and still isn't) alot of documentation how to do this properly and the code that was there, was hard to understand complicated code. There are many corner cases to deal with (e.g. Linq's Group by has different scoping than SQLs so you have to interpret the tree to properly convert it at the right places, introducing projections etc.). \n\nWould an LLM be able to build that for me? No. I doubt it ever will. It's niche, I know, but I like it as an example of a complex system that requires a lot of work on many levels to make it work. The run-off-the-mill CRUD app might be an ideal case for LLM based AI tools, other complex tasks might be a bridge too far and always will be.",

You may also find that you start growing beyond the plan file into developing a “codebase” of documentation. Your job becomes managing and writing the documentation plus reviewing the code, and writing code only when it’s a simple change or when you need to unravel some problem that Claude created and that your reviews let slip.\n\nAlso, I find it easier to iterate with Claude on documentation than on code. Claude writes cleaner code the fewer iterations it makes on any implementation, so you want to really focus on iterating a plan and discarding the code when it’s wrong.",

They learn by identifying patterns in data, which allows them to generate new outputs by leveraging their internal parameters. This means that while you won't necessarily receive the most optimal or innovative code, you'll get solutions that reflect the **average** quality and approaches present in the training data.\n\nTherefore, you should employ machine learning in scenarios where **average** is acceptable. For instance, ML can be beneficial for *generating initial drafts of unit tests* or *creating functions that address common problems*. Additionally, ML can be useful in *identifying architectural errors* and *potential vulnerabilities* in code. You may also want to ask improvements to your existing code, to *learn and improve*.\n\nIf you use AI to generate full-blown, production-ready applications, oof. Don't do that.

Imagine someone enters \"no peanuts\" on their order.  A human can read this, but that fails at scale.  Imagine if we could tag allergy concerns, so \"no peanuts\" and \"extra spicy\" have different urgencies?  Or if they said \"swap the chicken for shrimp\" - we want to call them and confirm the extra $$ on the order.  \n\nSo, we have a process which takes a newly submitted menu and queries the LLM. *\"You are a food preparer.  Given this menu and these comments, please read each comment and tell me if they're about allergies, potentially change the cost of the order, or are very negative. Return your answers as structured JSON\".*\n\nThis works amazingly well. Customers aren't exposed to AI slop.  Even if it's not 100% accurate, it's incredibly useful.  It's affordable (about 10c per order) and runs fast enough (5-10 seconds). It's even cheaper in batch (you save on input tokens), so you can run dozens of orders at a time.",

          "text": "Here, I’ll give you an example of what my workflow might look like:\n\nMy team is deploying an internal product to help our Contracts folks negotiate with our suppliers and with our customers. They can upload contract language, we identify the clauses in the contract, provide some enrichment from internal and external datasets, score each clause using a combination of heuristics and ML, and provide an LLM generated top-line with citations.\n\nWe wanted to make these citations a bit more “rich”: add some icons, some conditional highlighting, some onHover behavior, etc.\n\nIt required some changes to our underlying datamodel, some new parsing logic, pipeline updates, then a bunch of wholey-new frontend components.\n\nI had a bunch of this already in my head. I knew which datamodel changes I wanted to make, and I knew how to write the parsing logic I wanted. I spent a morning writing a TDD for these changes. I sent it around to my team for comments. I used Claude Code with Opus 4.5 to plan out the tickets: I knew it would be like 5-8 tickets, but wasn’t sure *all* of the files I needed to touch, and wanted to make sure I hadn’t missed anything. Took me about an hour to get all the tickets written to the level of detail I wanted.\n\nAfter that was done, and I’d reviewed my team’s comments, I started working through the tickets.\n\nI implemented the parsing logic myself, I made the datamodel changes and ran migrations. I used Claude Code to bang out the pipeline changes in the meantime. Took me about an hour to write my bit, I checked in on Claude Code every 15min or so to make sure it was moving in the right direction.\n\nThen, I spent about 10-15min reviewing its PR (not really a PR, I had it in a local git worktree, but same idea). Backend changes all look good to me.\n\nI push the branches to get CI going, tag a coworker or two to review. I start on the frontend tickets.\n\nFor these, I point Claude Code (still Opus 4.5) at each Linear ticket, and give it the TDD I wrote as context. I point it at the Figma mocks our designer made.\n\nI check back in on CI for the backend PRs. I ask Claude Code to write some new unit tests covering the backend work. I review them. I edit a few, add one for an edge case it missed. I push.\n\nSwing back to the frontend agents. Fire up the website locally. It doesn’t look right. I tell Claude Code it needs to match the mocks *pixel perfect*. It churns for 5min. Ok, now it matches.\n\nI spend 20min reviewing the frontend changes while CI runs. I add three new end-to-end tests. Everything looks good to me, I tag a coworker in a PR for awareness, set GH to automerge.\n\nMy mental model for Claude Code right now is basically “we are all tech leads”. I spend pretty close to zero time actually *writing* code in vim. Instead, my time is all pre-work and architecture, and code-review. To be fair, this is basically how my job *has* been for the last couple years: figure out what *should* be done, delegate, review what comes back. I think it’s actually made me a more rigorous tech lead because Claude can be super stupid sometimes. It means I have to think about what might be misinterpreted in my tickets, forces me to be really explicit about when I care about certain system specifics, and when I don’t. It means my people-engineers get better-scoped, more detailed plans from me as well.\n\nLater, we want to add the same citations frontend behavior to another part of the website. I didn’t bother writing a ticket — I just pointed Claude at it. “Make this field like XYZ other field, only use existing components and logic.” 3min later, PR ready to merge.

We have no juniors, everyone’s got minimum 5 years experience. Now I’m back to being an IC, but I think I’m basically bringing my tech lead workflow with me. Part of it is that at my current startup everyone on the team own certain products/initiatives, and borrows small parts of each other’s time. So we all sorta act like the lead for some things, and the IC for others. Having a lot of written material makes it easy for us to stay on top of what everyone else is doing.\n\nOnce we start hiring juniors/interns, I’m not sure how I’ll coach them to use LLMs. Seems tricky and it’s a bridge I haven’t crossed yet.\n\n2. Since we’re prototyping/shipping quite quickly, it’s quite important that we can refactor freely. One thing we experiment with quite a bit is our internal datamodels and some of our API contracts. To give us confidence that we aren’t breaking anyone up/downstream, we spent a bunch of time thinking through some truly end-to-end customer workflows. If they can come back green, we know our system works, even with significant refactors to big parts of our system. With this product we’re at the stage where we want to make breaking changes maybe every week, maybe multiple times a week. Having a strong test harness makes me more confident, and I also think it’s a useful piece of documentation (like a good README) to point the LLMs at in terms of explicit “intended system behavior”. You can often do stuff like “make ABC tests pass, you may not modify the tests”, and that helps bound the LLM a bunch. End-to-end works particularly well, as unit tests can get stale pretty quickly as we modify architecture and internal behavior.",

          "text": "I use AI constantly now, but for me there is a big difference between vibe coding and let’s call it “AI assisted programming”. \n\nLet’s firstly talk about vibe coding. I tried to vibe code a small statistical dashboard for our app. To be honest I achieved what I wanted to achieve, it shows all the data it looks ok, nothing fancy. I spent approximately 6 to 8 hours to do this. Which previously would take me maybe like 3 to 5 working days. So it’s really a noticeable speed up. But. The code is absolute fucking garbage and I absolutely don’t trust it. It’s cool as a demo, but I wouldn’t push this to prod. Also, I still used my knowledge as programmer. I told the AI how ETL pipeline should be structured, even though the code is garbage I still managed to have some separation of concerns there. But still, mine influence on the code was relatively minimal.\n\nBut when it comes to “AI assisted programming” that’s completely different thing. So here I’m more in control and I would create the structure, set everything up and I would just outsource the “boring part” to AI. For example, you just need to develop another simple feature, that doesn’t require much thought. It’s pretty clear how to implement it and you can explain to AI how it should be done. Yes, go ahead and give it to AI. But you see, for this you need to understand the structure of the existing code. In tools like Cursor/Claude code when prompting I quite often tag specific files where changes need to happen and tell it to reuse specific functions. AI is actually very good at solving small, structured and limited problems. Yes, people are too. But still even to mechanically type it and think about small details will take you like several hours, but with this you heavy it ready in 10 minutes.\n\nActually, I have like a rule of thumb to understand if I’m vibe coding or I do “AI assisted programming”. If I can’t review all the code that is generated by AI, and I don’t fully understand it, then it’s 100% vibe coding.\n\nAnother big thing what I use AI for is understanding different code bases. At work, and I work in a big corporate, we have a lot of different repositories that I need to use from time to time. And being in a big corporate means that in 90% of cases it’s much simpler and faster to figure things out on your own than trying to find the right person. So we have company approved Claude code. And I use it to understand what this code base does, how it works, and what parameters I should use. \n\nAnd another thing, is writing small throw away scripts. So there is a joke that programmers would spend 3 days automating things they can manually do in 30 minutes. Well, now with AI you can actually automate it in 5 minutes. And for such things I don’t even use AI code editors. I just ask ChatGPT or other to write script and I’ll copy paste it.",

I enjoy coding and I don’t want to have a tool code my important logic for me and if I absolutely need the help I walk through the code step by step and make sure I understand it. \n\nWhat makes me use AI is when I have spent at least an hour trying to find documentation that better explains an error I’m finding or a solution with one of the build tools I use. I work in the embedded space and I have two build systems, Yocto and CMake. Yocto has a lot of lackluster documentation with no examples and lots of syntactical sugar that is not straightforward. Most of my times using AI have been because I could not figure out how to use some obscure feature in Yocto. This is largely since the space around Yocto is largely proprietary (how many open source embedded OSs are being made?) so you just don’t see a lot of examples or really any documentation when you get into obscure problems. Even then I have had AI fail on me but it did help me generate new ideas I couldn’t see. \n\nI have also used it once for CMake help when I could not figure out how to package and deploy a header only file for Conan2. I don’t recall well if AI helped or looking at Eigen3’s Conan config helped more.\n\nI have gotten so much junior code that they could not explain that was clearly written by AI that I cannot justify using it. Maybe it increases the individuals velocity but it does not hold under scrutiny of code review and wastes other people’s time. I’ve held PRs for weeks as they try to vibe code to meet expectations. I admit it would be easier if we had code quality CI/CD but that’s a battle that has been fought and lost in my code base.",

          "text": "I started a project a few months ago to explore this very question: https://github.com/mbcrawfo/vibefun\n\nIt's a functional programming language that transpiles to JS.  I don't necessarily intend to push for its usage, but it's meant to be complete enough that it _could_ be used.  I wanted a project with real world complexity that involved domains where I don't have deep knowledge (compilers, type systems, etc.).  It's been on hold for about a month due to RL, but the language design is probably 95% complete and the compiler is at about 80%.  The code is 100% written by Claude Code.  Probably about half Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5.\n\nWhat I'm finding is that it's surprisingly (even shockingly) capable.  But you MUST tailor your approach to work within the capabilities of the AI.  From my experience so far:\n\n* As always the hard part is the requirements.  Several times on this project I had to step back and work out more detailed requirements for the language and/or compiler (still using Claude) because _I_ could see that we were trying to implement something too vague.  Claude will sometimes ask questions when it realizes more detail is needed, but it's never going to tell you \"we need to stop and rethink this entire plan.\"\n* You must leverage CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md.  Not just for understanding your code base and standards, but helping the agents navigate and maintain complex parts of the code and repo.  For example the docs/spec (language spec documentation) in my project.\n* You must add all the guardrails you possibly can - strongly typed languages, linters, etc. and you must make sure they're required.  CLAUDE.md isn't enough.  Git hooks aren't enough, Claude knows that it can bypass them with `HUSKY=0 git commit..`.  I added a [Claude hook](https://github.com/mbcrawfo/vibefun/blob/main/.claude/hooks/pre-commit-verify.sh) to block it from committing without passing checks.\n* You must test the hell out of the code base.  My project is about 75% test code and has 90% coverage.  It's not just validating functionality, it's more documentation to tell the agent how the code is supposed to work AND more guardrails to catch problems if the agents starts to go nuts when refactoring or changing functionality.\n* You MUST have multiple layers of checks.  I have Claude form a plan and save it (see `.claude/archive` for examples), then usually have at least 2-3 clean sessions review and revise the plan.  After implementation have a clean session audit the implementation for completeness.  I also have Claude set up in github actions to review PRs (recently set up CodeRabbit tho haven't really used it yet) and it has absolutely pointed out problems with PRs.  Claude Code can use the github CLI to review feedback and update the PR, which is pretty nice.  You need all of this because no matter what you do the agent will sometimes just do whatever the hell it wants - decide that part of the work will be deferred to later, decide that a linter or type error can just be marked with a TODO, or that failing tests are ok because they represent \"pre-existing problems\", etc.\n\nAlso, it's gonna cost money unless you're very casual.  When I started I was on the $20/month plan, it took less than 90 min of coding to hit limits.  I bumped to the $100 plan and have been ok with it, only came close to hitting the limits once when I tried running 3 sessions simultaneously with worktrees.  That gave me a serious headache tho, not interested in doing it regularly.\n\nIf I was starting a new greenfield project with complete control over the technical direction I'd seriously consider vibing it with Claude.  But what does this mean for existing code bases, especially messy legacy code with poor structure, no tests, etc.?  That I don't know, and I think it's going to be very challenging to effectively integrate agents into those code bases.  Unfortunately my day job only allows Copilot, so I haven't been able to explore that aspect very much.",

I ask it a simple question about a table in our API contract and it hallucinates a non-existent param.\n\nBut some of my friends and acquaintances have had success with it, which surprises me.\n\n1. My friend at Amazon uses it a lot on his side hustle. It \"10x'd\" his speed. It made him way faster, especially since it was in a field of development he wasn't really specialized in -- mobile development -- and it's a new codebase. But he also said AI was an amazing gaslighter so his usage of AI basically turned his workflow into Code Review Simulator 2025.\n\n2. My friend at Facebook says he can get much, much more work done. When I asked him about it, he said that he \"cba digging through code to find a string\", so AI helps him find things.\n\n3. An acquaintance at an AI startup (forgot to ask which one cause I was drunk during Thanksgiving) said they used AI a lot. As expected. That he doesn't really write code himself anymore, AI does everything. I didn't really have time to dig into everything and ask him about how new/small this codebase was. Also, I was drunk.\n\n4. One of my coworkers uses it and increased her productivity. She attributes the productivity increase to AI, and she did double her output, if AI is truly behind it.\n\nSo there are obviously people who have had success, but I'm unable to replicate that success. There's probably some level of skill issue or some setup that I'm missing, I'm just not sure if that's the entire story. After all, economists are still unsure of the link between AI and actual productivity outcomes. If it's not easily spotted, is it real? Or just placebo? Not sure.",

From that I started extracting smaller .md files as phases of a plan and then fed that as initial input to the ai, along the way I keep generting various analysis, plan, implementation log and report files and have a mix od human in the loop and more autonomous sessions reading those and spitting out new ones along side the code changes they are doing. \n\nI had a mix of going back and forth between implementing new features, testing, debugging, fixing and refactoring stuff already added and so on. \n\nThe current result is that I have all the functionality ported and it will be tested by our qa for 2 weeks while I am on vacation, on the code side I have 4 different branches covering all the implemenation besides the initial setup stuff, just actual features.\n\nFrist one is the entire auth, profile, onboarding flow, the second one is around 10 simple entity crud flows for the admin, the last two are the actual user flows, the users create something over a multi step detailed form and then they are matched with other users based on some logic and that is basically it.\n\nI probably spent about 20% of my total time on the project on the review and refactoring of the first release MR and I have it exactly how I would want it, and probably at a better state then if I would have wrote it, cause I usually wouldnt add this many tests, besides that,  it would be hard to tell that this looks different then what I would have written without ai.\n\nThe other release merge requests are a lot messier and contain a lot of stuff that is either overcomplicated, not consistent, or plain old wrong etc. \n\nThe plan now is to get all the QA found bugs that will be there in two weeks when I am back from vacation, fix them and go through the same process for all the remaining not refactored release branches and get the code to a place where I am confident to accept it and merge it to production. \n\nIn the entire process I did a couple of manual changes here and there, but for all practical considerations the ai wrote and rewrote the entire project. \n\nI dont have a strong conclusions at this point, besides that using ai as a web dev is probably not going to be optional anymore, besides that, what the process should look like, where the human in the loop is important, exactly how much faster or better on the one hand or worse if overused and underchecked on the other will this make us I have no confidence to say yet.",

If through cursor UI, I'll ask for something in broad strokes, like adding an onboarding flow and explaining the pages I want, then for changes like a better component organization or interface adjustments. Eventually I reach diminishing returns and finish and polish whatever it wrote. LLMs always write more than is necessary and cleanup needs to happen to manage project complexity.\n\nThe main value here I think is rapid prototyping. Even for old projects, you sometimes add new things to it and telling an LLM to build it from scratch in a few different ways can quickly test feasibility. Much gets thrown out in these cases anyway. Just, when you've found the approach you prefer, it's important to rework and test and simplify whatever was generated and not just merge it in.\n\nFor the custom tool, I just use that when I'm doing rote work. It's kind of an experiment with getting LLMs to build things more reliably, more info here:\n\nhttps://workflows.saf-demo.online/\n\nIt's basically a way to generate boilerplate then run prompts and checks automatically. It's the only way that I can see where I can have these tools build something non trivial without constant supervision or massive tech debt.",

I then go through a review process with the LLM where I read, ask for corrections, ask questions to get understanding of what it meant, etc.  When I'm satisfied, I copy that into my Confluence design page.  I do a couple more rounds of review and polish there, then present it.  It is so much faster than before I had the LLM assistant and I end up being more grounded in the design because of the review process I did with the LLM.\n\nAnother project I have set up (instructions plus context persisted for all chats in that project) that will generate code from that design.  Again, I go through a review and polishing process with the LLM until I'm ready to try to build and unit test.  With this one, I've learned that ChatGPT tends to overengineer and it's a process of getting simple.  \n\nOne is for code reviews.

          "text": "I've been using ChatGPT extensively since it came out and I feel like it really improved with their thinking models. Today it is usually much better and quicker than just searching on Google.\n\nAs a coding assistant, it became better and better over time. Initially I was just copying code from my machine to ChatGPT and some context, which was super annoying and slow.\n\nI remember trying out Codex (or Claude Code (?), don't remember) at the beginning of this year or in the early part of the summer and wanting to try out just how much could I push these models and how heavilly I could rely on them to do most if not all of the coding work. The first 2 hours were really impressive but then the code became full of design problems / code smell / repeated slightly different versions of code. It would also get stuck in edit/unedit loops (e.g. make change X, doesn't work, revert change X, doesn't work, do change X, repeat).\n\nSo I didn't try these agnetic models after that, until in the middle of November this year when I had an ambitious, low-ish risk project project at work and I had read these models had greatly improved. So I thought about doing the exact same thing, that is see how far I could push these models and check out how heavilly I could rely on them. So I tried Codex once again.\n\nLong-story short: At this point in time I don't think I ever need to write code ever again for mainstream programming language work. These models have improved \\_A LOT\\_ over these few months.\n\nI'd plan the project with ChatGPT 5.something Thinking and Pro and construct a \\`PLAN.md\\` that I'd then have Codex work off of.\n\nAnd it turned out really well. I was very cautious first. Checking all the edits it made and vetting all of them. Criticising the code it wrote or the reasoning for writing the code. I then slowly let that go and just wanted to see how fast we could possibly progress. Turns out I was the biggest bottleneck in getting features out.\n\nAs the project grew and started working, there were tons of features I wanted to add to it and when I reached a point where the work could be done in parallel I would run multiple agents working on different parts of the code base that don't intersect with each other. Now I've reached a point where that is too slow (e.g. having multiple agents working on the same code base) as they step onto each others toes when implementing features, and I am figuring out how to proceed (e.g. each agent runs on its own container and has a copy of the code base and the something-something merge requests, etc.)\n\nIt was also super addicting.\n\nBut as you do it for 12 hours a day for a few weeks you start to notices the issues and quirks of Codex, e.g. it would sometimes just want to delete the contents of your files, get stuck in edit/unedit loops (where something is broken, make change X, still broken, undo change X, still broken, redo change X, repeat), get stuck in really long thinking loops where it made no progress for up to an hour at least for what seemd like a trivial task, or its personality would flip and it would become really hesitant about editing code (to the extent it refused to do, e.g. \"Are you really sure you want to do it? It is a really big change and has to touch on all the files of the codebase.\"), etc. The code it makes also starts to become smelly and poorly architected over time and you have to explicitly suggest for it to rearchitecture/refactor. After multiple compactions it would also tend to become weird and glitchy, so I often start a new fresh codex once it starts to behave weirdly. I was also surprised that 400K tokens is pretty small (about 10 - 20 minutes of work on gpt-5.1.codex high).\n\nSo, yes, I am in the process of figuring out how I can accelerate even more as there are lots of features I want it to work on simultaneously but my environment is poorly structured for that. It definitely feels now you can 10x (or more) your productivity with these current models.\n\nIf you are skeptical just try them out for yourself.\n\nBTW: I was using Codex CLI.",

Within my team, I've seen it used a lot for essentially transcribing designs from Figma to React - in these cases, the \"more of the same\" aspect comes up and you see a lot of low-level building blocks being used. For example, `<Typography variant=\"m\">` instead of a higher-level component that would describe the semantics.\n\nAI-assisted PRs have tended to be big, but I think that's down to both our code structure and the AI tools\n\nThe tests I've seen it produce are mostly fine, but it will often introduce a couple of tests that are worthless.

Feel free to ask if something's unclear.\n\nI don't write much new code myself, due to the current role and circumstances, but I still read a lot and modify some.

Ignore LLM model provider and LLM based tooling vendor marketing. It's mostly bs.\n\nAlways remember that LLMs are token prediction machines. Very complex and large ones so they give an illusion of understanding or thought sometimes but that's just that, an illusion. Asking a chatbot about something is like taking top 3 results from google search and skimming the contents (gross oversimplification on my part but close enough). Can be 100% right for something popular and uncontroversial, can be plain wrong, or in between. And that's not even taking into account settings you don't see when interacting with a chatbot (system prompt, temperature, top K, input & output filtering, ...).\n\nThere are programming use cases & niches where AI, especially the top models combined with top tier tooling (cough, Cursor, cough) shine. I know actual people not writing any (or almost any) code by hand in professional setting. There are caveats and specifics to that so don't expect anyone to be able to do the same in every programming related role.\n\n(continued below)",

I'd done a lot of experimentation early on this year and hadn't been particularly impressed. Things have dramatically changed though and I'm now pretty shocked at what is possible. There is still a ways to go, especially on the web design side but it's impressive. \n\nThe problem however is now that rather being a software engineer I'm far closer to being a product owner who is doing requirements engineering. It's possible to 'vibe' it but then it's a pretty crappy loop of describing a small change, evaluating the plan, letting Codex implement and then evaluating the change. \n\nIt's also .. unsatisfying. I got into software engineering due to ADHD traits and focusing on problems felt great. As said, this is closer to requirements engineering/product ownership and fixing a problem ... just isn't as satisfying.\n\nLong story short, if approaches like Codex continue to improve I expect a shift in what we do (for apps) to change to being more requirements driven, but having an understanding of the technical tradeoffs that approaches an AI might take in implementing features or addressing problems is going to remain valuable.",

Setting up a npm package/vite library for React components and css tokens, so different apps can use the same styling. I had never set up a library before and AI walked me through how to configure vite for a package, the build, etc.\n\n4. Any figma design, I can throw Claude at it and it gets it 90% of the way there in minutes. No more manually going back and forth or copy pasting a figma component and editing it in your code. If Claude is set up to do “best practices” and pull from existing styles it’s very easy to get it to pull stuff over in a DRY way.\n\n5. I will throw a full ticket at it, copy pasted from Jira, and it will hunt down what might be causing the problem in the code. I will continue to prompt Claude forward until it can explain or point at something that I can then manually go in and investigate. Great when you don’t have domain knowledge.\n\n6. 3rd party integrations. If the 3rd party has online documentation that is public (like most) -super easy. I have only done this with one company so far but it is basically telling Claude where I want it in the code, what the url of the documentation is, and then going and cleaning it up after.",

But I'm willing to try it out and use it where I find it useful.\n\nWorkflow-wise, I make sure my workspace is clean and fully committed to version control before I make any requests of an agent.  (I'm generally in the .NET space, so am using CoPilot in Visual Studio and VS Code.)  That way, if something gets bungled, I can back out of it easily.\n\nI find it *very* useful to generate IaC devops scripts - Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.  I can never quite remember the syntax and big bunches of it are boilerplate anyway; I also feel like (maybe because it's declarative rather than functional?) the models are better about reasoning through how these kinds of script work.  This is a huge benefit to me specifically because I never really enjoyed that stuff - I like *having it exist*, but *configuring and troubleshooting it* has never appealed to me.\n\nSomething else I've found especially helpful is when there are changes that need to be made in several places simultaneously.  For example, say you decide to change your project's structure - that'll involve moving files, changing namespaces, possibly renaming files, updating references, etc.  It's boring and it's slow and it's no fun.  I've had pretty good results using CoPilot in agent mode with instructions like \"Move the model classes all into a separate folder, categorized by domain.  Once complete, rebuild the solution and fix any errors.\"\n\nA lot of people have claimed they find AI useful for writing tests, but my experience with that hasn't been very good - I've put a lot of effort into decreasing the difficulty of adding tests, so writing unit tests isn't a big time sink for me to start with, and I've often seen AI generate tests that look fine at first glance but (for example) aren't actually asserting anything meaningful.  I find writing tests more enjoyable than reviewing and correcting generated tests.\n\nI've also found that generated code is often more like a StackOverflow answer - it may address the immediate question at hand, but may not be written in a way that works as well if you need a bit more abstraction.  But introducing that sort of thing is \"the fun part\" of writing software for me - so that's a perfectly acceptable outcome.",

Probably another refactor as AI make questionable design choices, but mainly for code readability\n6. run entire test suite\n7. use feedback from linters, radon (cyclomatic complexity) to fix code to ensure it adheres to standards\n8. run additional tests against our CI/CD pipeline and ensure everything works (here our company uses cursor bugbot which can catch additional potential issues)\n9. Ask AI to update documentation and write PR description of the changes\n10. Raise a PR and request another teammate to review your code",

For example if I want to write a chrome plugin for the first time, it is pretty great at setting up the framework to do all of it. Similarly with any sort of scripts to improve productivity, they are one off and not hooked into a larger code base and these can increase productivity.\n\n\nTests: \n\n\n- I like to make it write the first few tests, but I hate when it writes 30 tests. Now I just ask it to write one test to test a specific thing. Then I make sure the test is functioning correctly then copy it to make the five tests that I want of that style.\n\n\n- when it writes all 30 tests, it often isn't testing what it appears to be testing. Or is testing in such a way that it passes regardless of whether the code is right. In a sense it is trying to write tests that pass.\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\n- One shot it works, or it goes around in circles and sucks. Mostly the latter, so far as I can tell. \n\n\n- It very quickly turns to hacky solutions to make things work rather than sticking to best practices that you have asked it to, or that exist in the code base.\n\n\nOverall, it is too eager to write too much. And the more code there is written the more bugs there are. The more code there is to read, surpassing the ability of the dev to comprehend and parse all of it. So I don't understand how people are letting agents loose to write tons of code. I end up trying my best to constrain it to write less code most of the time, so that I can ensure it's doing the right thing.",

I don't really write much code any more, and am able to build out major features in days that would have taken a team and months to do without AI. \n\nMy time is spent mostly in an IDE still writing planning documents, reviewing agent results, managing version control, and providing guidance by prompting with speech-to-text. I push the agent to use modern standards and tools. It tries to hand-roll everything by default, like it's in a coding contest, so it needs to be told. \n\nValidation is done the same as before: Manual, E2E, or Unit depending on the project. Unit is mostly for libraries. E2E for user-facing apps. Manual is all you need for prototypes and experimental branches. \n\nAs far as evaluating the upsides and downsides, there is far less \"low-level\" thinking required which means you get more practice at conceptual planning. More code review means your intuition for code quality grows. More time writing natural language means your communication skills improve. If your goal is just to build stuff, then this is all great. The downside is that you won't be in touch with the inner workings of your projects. On the other hand, building your own libraries is easier than ever so you might end up with a deep understanding anyways. \n\nIn the past, I would plan things out as well as I could and do the coding in dedicated, high-intensity sessions. It's these sessions which are eliminated by using AI and I don't miss them because I feel like they were stressful and unhealthy. The speed boost and reduced stress makes programming feel like a game now.",

To replicate this, I copy the email address of the sender of the email I'm on, and paste it into the search bar with [from:$sender in:inbox].  But last week, instead of doing that, I realized that I could have Claude write a chrome plugin to do this for me.  So I gave it this prompt:  \n\n    i want to create a chrome extension called \"gmail search for sender\".  requirements:\n\n    add a keyboard shortcut to gmail to activate the functionality\n    the keyboard shortcut should be pressing i.\n    when you press the shortcut, it will search the current message for it's sender, ideally using the from: line, and then do a gmail search for messages from that sender in the inbox.\n    The search should look like \"from:$email in:inbox\"\n\nAnd it gave me a chrome plugin and install instructions.  I found one bug, that I told it about and it fixed, and then I had a plugin.  This plugin 10x my email productivity.  Now I can get through 1000 messages at a time -- before I could get through maybe 10 before I got tired of the copy/paste.\n\nI am not a frontend dev, so I could not have done this myself without hours of work and I most likely would have given up before getting it to work.  Using Claude was the only way this would happen.\n\n*How we use it at work*\n\nI'm the CEO of a small software company.  I've told my team that they can use the company card to pay for any AI tool they find value in.  Some are using Claude, some are using Gemini, some are using Codex.  Each uses it for different things.\n\n- One team member uses it for simple frontend work.  He's great at backend, but not at frontend, so he will use AI to write frontend code.\n\n- Another team member used it for porting work.  We had a library in Python and wanted to make a Go version.  He did not just ask it to port the whole library, but instead went function by function asking it to port each one using the Python as a reference.  He would give Claude the general plan and context as to what the function does, and then iterate with Claude for a bit, sometimes making manual changes.  He also used Claude to write the initial test suite by porting over the Python test suite.  *Claude/AI is really good at porting existing code to a new language*.\n\n- Others are using it for code review.  They will plug their code into AI after writing it and ask for a code review.  Sometimes it comes up with some useful suggestions, which they will implement themselves before submitting for human code review.\n\nOverall my team members say that it's increased their productivity 2-3x.\n\n*How my friends use it*\n\nhttps://github.com/adrianco/meGPT\n\nHe built an entire MCP server to replicate himself, and it was 100% coded in AI.  He also has another project where he wrote a Swift app, also 100% coded in AI.  He's doing this work in the open on his GitHub so people can follow along.  He's retired now, so he just does this for a couple hours a week, but he's outputting as many results as he used to when he was working full time.\n\nAnother friend set up an \"AI coding team\", where they gave each AI a personality (\"you are a principal engineer and believe in test driven development\", \"you are a curmudgeon, you poke holes in everyone else's code\").  Then they give the task to the \"team\" with a detailed design document, which iterates and comes up with a solution.",

I'm leaving.  \n  \nI know any tool should do the job and the editor you use shouldn't affect your ability to do your tasks as much, but I'm doing this full time and it's becoming a daily inconvenience.\n\nI'm mandated to use VS code and Sourcetree. Both great tools, but *I* *live* inside the shell. Their workflow is good, but not for me. I have asked for a reason and they gave the following:\n\n\\- They want to prevent mistakes from happening --> So instead of responsibility, they introduced a seatbelt  \n\\- They want me to be able to help others, as well as have them help me. If I use different tools, that becomes harder --> We can just open GitLab, or, I don't know, open a different editor when someone is looking at my screen :)\n\nI've already addressed this multiple times and it starts to gnaw at me. I proposed the idea of instead of mandating a tool, mandating key features of said tool. For example, instead of \"You should use VSCode\", they could say \"You should use an editor with LSP support and a linter as well as basic highlighting features\". They then told me that they don't feel like managing multiple types of software and they don't want everyone to download whatever they feel like (I should mention, we are concerned with information security and therefore comply to ISO/IEC 27001 standard.)\n\nI seem to be alone in this, because I'm the only dev at my workplace that seems to have a problem with this. This makes it very hard to have a credible opinion. Most other devs already used VS code along with Sourcetree (or Fork) and others have started their careers at this place with said tools.\n\nI feels like I'm at a dead end with this. I'm not planning to leave for this, but the fact that we're being micro managed like this does give me the ick. Do you think it's feasible to try and convince management? And if so, what do you recommend?",

People aren't standard.  The implication is that they're not interested in getting the best you have to offer, they just want what you can give without tailoring your role to you because customizing your company laptop undermines the ability to pass it along to drone 53 and they pick up where you left off.  \n\nAnd again, I get why; they development to be a solid bedrock on which they can build.

You'll look amazing and responsible and the organization will grind to a half under a sea of red tape.  Make everything a management decision that requires sign off.\n\n- Suck it up.

It only takes one to bring in a new tool and cause security and compliance issues.\n\nWhat you can do is to talk to the top level engineers (Sr. Staff, principle) and ask for their opinion. If it was strictly a management decision, then you can ask about the process they followed to make that decision. Who did they involve? What research was done? What happened to trigger this mandate?\n\nIt never hurts to ask for clarity.",

          "text": "You’re not wrong to feel the ick. What you’re reacting to isn’t Cursor or VS Code. It’s a shift in how trust and responsibility are being handled.\n\nMandating a tool instead of mandating outcomes is a common management move under uncertainty. It feels safer because it’s legible. “Everyone uses the same thing” is easier to reason about than “everyone understands what they’re doing.” But that safety is mostly cosmetic.\n\nA few hard truths that may help you decide how much energy to spend here:\n\nFirst, this isn’t really about editors. It’s about governability. Management is optimizing for predictability and supportability. Tool standardization lowers coordination cost and makes oversight feel simpler. That’s true even when there is no regulatory requirement driving it.\n\nIf there is a regulatory or compliance requirement, the mistake is the same one you already identified: confusing controls with brands. Standards almost never require a specific editor. They require capabilities, auditability, and accountability. Mandating a tool is an implementation shortcut, not a compliance necessity.\n\nSecond, they’re conflating guardrails with judgment. Seatbelts don’t replace drivers. Linters don’t replace understanding. “AI-first” doesn’t prevent mistakes. It changes where and how mistakes surface. If the organization can’t explain why a system behaves the way it does without pointing at a tool, they’ve traded responsibility for comfort.\n\nThird, you’re likely outnumbered because most people don’t feel the cost yet. Standard tools are usually a net positive for juniors and generalists. The friction shows up for people who are deeply fluent and already operate with strong internal discipline. That doesn’t make your concern invalid. It just makes it invisible to the majority.\n\nIf you try to convince management, don’t argue preference or philosophy. Argue failure modes.\n\nA productive framing sounds like:\n“I’m aligned with the goals: fewer incidents, better collaboration, and lower risk. My concern is that we’re treating tools as controls instead of requiring specific behaviors and capabilities. That works until something goes wrong, and then nobody can explain why.”\n\nThen offer concrete alternatives that still satisfy oversight needs:\n\t•\tDefine required capabilities, not brands.\n\t•\tDefine review, ownership, and rollback expectations explicitly.\n\t•\tAllow tool variance with a clear support boundary: if you choose a non-standard tool, you own first-line support.\n\t•\tMake AI usage explicit and reviewable, not assumed safe by default.\n\nThat last point matters. “AI-first” without clear expectations around review and ownership doesn’t reduce risk. It redistributes it. Speed without comprehension is deferred outage.\n\nNow the uncomfortable part.\n\nEven if you’re right, this may still be a losing argument. Some organizations choose uniformity over judgment on purpose. Not because they’re incompetent, but because they’re optimizing for scale, not craft. That’s a valid choice. It’s just not a neutral one.\n\nYou’re not unreasonable for pushing back. You’re also not obligated to stay if the direction continues toward tool-enforced conformity and away from judgment-based trust.\n\nThe craft was never meant to be duct tape and YAML. The craft is building systems that behave under pressure, and being able to explain why.\n\nIf that’s no longer what’s being rewarded, believe the signal.",

It’s _much_ easier to simply train everyone on a consistent set of tools, so that any developer can be productive on any project, and if there is investment in common infrastructure that impact is maximized because the support surface is minimized.\n\nAlso you’re not considering other issues:\n* Security and Compliance review. Every tool that touches the source code needs to be validated to ensure it’s not leaking your company’s IP or customer data. Particularly if you deal with GDPR stuff, you have to be *super careful* around compliance for any tool that might interact with any customer data. \n* Liability issues in the event of a defect. This is usually only relevant to safety critical software, but if it turns out a defect is introduced into the source due to a defect in the tool used to modify the source, this can open up the company to liability. Therefore all of the tools must be explicitly certified. Certifying tools is very expensive and time consuming. Your individual velocity is not worth that effort.\n\nIt’s fine to think a workplace isn’t for you if their workflow doesn’t suit your needs. That’s a mature decision to make. But there are a _lot_ of very good reasons a company, especially a large company where no single developer actually has that much impact in the end, may want to restrict the set of tools their employees use, even if those tools are “free” from a license standpoint.",

Relying exclusively on CI as your only line of defense for software quality is a poor choice. It certainly should make change *easier to validate*, but all testing has oracle issues. Plus, CI does nothing to validate your random editor/extension is not leaking your IP to a third party, or customer data. (To be clear, extensive CI is wonderful. “If CI passes, it ships to main” should be the goal for every org. The repo I work in day to day sweeps well over 80 permutations of compiler/C++ standard/OS/stdlib combinations, plus another 20 or so sanitizers and static analysis tools).\n\nIn addition, for safety critical software development, it’s not really an option, it’s *required* to qualify every single tool that could impact the bits that wind up executing on the safety critical system. For example, read [this](https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/tag-team/Objects/m/61793_CMR10-16.pdf ) paper from MathWorks on the process for ISO26262.

The team is working well and we're optimistic to get QA operational by the end of Q3'26. \n\nMy next big task is assembling a team to migrate the stored procedure nightmare that basically runs the entire company. There's 4 or 5 databases each with \\~500 stored procedures running on a single Microsoft SQL instance. As you can imagine, costs and latency balloon as we try to add more customers. \n\nThe system is slightly decoupled, HTTP requests ping back and forth between 3 main components, and there's an in-house ORM orchestrating all of the magic. There's nothing inherently wrong with the ORM, and I'd like to keep it place, but it is responsible for calling all the stored procedures.  \n\nThe final component/layer is responsible for receiving the HTTP requests and executing the query/insert/stored procedure (It's basically SQL over HTTP, the payload contains the statement to be executed). \n\n  \nWhile some of the functions are appropriately locked in the database, a very large percentage of them would be simplified as code. This would remove load from the database, expand the pool of developers that are able to work on them, and sweet sweet unit testing.\n\nI'm thinking of \"intercepting\" the stored procedure requests, and more-or-less building a switch statement/dictionary with feature flags (procedure, tenant, percentage) that would call native code opposed to the stored proc.  \n\n  \nDoes anyone have experience with this?\n\n  \n",

If it is not important to improve the performance, and moving to the cloud is the primary goal, then I would try to avoid making any changes to the stored procedures unless necessary. You might see some significant performance improvements if you just optimize the SQL in the existing stored procedures.\n\nRegarding the solution you proposed...IMO the idea of a \"SQL over HTTP\" service sounds like an unnecessary abstraction in the first place. The database itself is SQL over HTTP -- why do you need an additional layer? Furthermore, having the SQL over HTTP service rewrite the queries sounds extremely confusing and error-prone. It's not hard to imagine a situation in which the service breaks a query by rewriting it incorrectly, and then the upstream clients can't figure out why it's not working because they sent the correct SQL to the downstream service.",

          "text": "Let's get back to basics: Are you sure that the stored procedures are the performance problem?\n\nStored procedures aren't imbued with any intrinsic performance detriments that are - in and of themselves - going to compromise your workload.\n\nOn the contrary, well-written stored procedures tend to perform better in a lot of scenarios.\n\nFor example: Suppose you have a transaction comprising two statements, where the result set (comprising an arbitrary number of rows) of the first statement informs the second statement.\n\nIf you were to write the equivalent in application-tier code, the results from the first statement would need to traverse the network so that the application-tier code could then run the second statement. Locks end up being held longer, increasing the occurrence of blocking - thus reducing concurrency, and increasing latencies - in a busy enough database, because SQL Server needs to wait on the client (the application-tier code) to consume the first result set, then run the second query, and ultimately commit the transaction. There are of course other factors such as the use of RCSI (read committed snapshot isolation) which complicate the matter, but you can probably see what I'm driving at.\n\nIf the application-tier code is egregious enough (e.g.: it loops through each row received and, in each iteration, does something relatively slow like appending data to a file or making a HTTP request over the network to another service) then the likelihood of blocking other concurrent database queries is very high.\n\nOn the other hand, no such network traversal would happen if the transaction comprising the two statements happens within a stored procedure.\n\nBut moving on.\n\nSQL Server is a sophisticated piece of software in which ultimately everything boils down to queueing (i.e., 'wait stats' for the topic of interest) and sharing. It's essentially one big zero-sum game of contention management where any one query in the workload runs in contention with - and to the detriment of - the others (unless you're overprovisioned, in which case the server will be quite bored).\n\nThe challenges are manifold. You need to identify your actual bottleneck. It'll be CPU, memory, disk IO, or network IO - or perhaps something more exotic. Analysing your wait stats are the way to accomplish this.\n\nYou might well find that there are a small handful of problematic queries that are overwhelmingly responsible for dominating the server's resources (CPU, RAM, IO), and in doing so marginalising the rest of the workload. If your databases are multi-tenanted, it might even be more specific than that: It might be the case that it's a small number of queries run in context of a specific tenant's data (i.e., perhaps you have 99th percentile tenants who absolutely dwarf all of your other tenants in terms of how many rows of data they have).\n\nYou might well find that some well-meaning developer has written a query that uses a TVF (table-valued function), and that this TVF is running hundreds or thousands of times per second (or worse). It's unfortunate, but a lot of developers fall into the trap of trying to modularise T-SQL code as they would C# code or Java code due to ideals like DRY (don't repeat yourself). But doing so in T-SQL can oftentimes compromise the query planner's ability to produce performant query plans.\n\nYou also need to consider the prospect that known challenges in SQL Server - such as parameter sniffing, or inaccurate estimates - are introducing inconsistency in your workloads. Perhaps queries are sometimes fast and sometimes slow depending on the order in which queries are executed and for which parameters (which might lead to a query plan cached for 'small' volumes of data being applied for 'large' volumes of data, or vice versa).\n\nThere is a whole body of knowledge - performance tuning - which is far too extensive to cover in a single Reddit comment.\n\nAnyway, suffice it to say that my gut feeling is that if you make a concerted effort to understand your current performance characteristics, you might find that a small amount of index or query tuning can actually change your fortunes and get you to a much happier place.\n\nYou don't necessarily have to take what amounts to presumably years of accumulated intellectual property and essentially dispose of it, which might itself take years of effort.\n\nIf these 2000 to 2500 stored procedures are even moderately complex, what you're describing is tantamount to a rewrite. As fun as it is to daydream about 'getting it right', these efforts tend to burn the political capital of those who pursue them and - frankly - can cripple otherwise healthy businesses (because the rewrites aren't without cost - they divert effort from other initiatives).\n\nI sympathise with the remarks about testability, but I'd put it to you that T-SQL isn't inherently untestable. There's an actual unit test library out there - tSQLt - if you fancy that. But you could just as easily write bespoke test scripts that establish a baseline (i.e., schema and data content) and then assert a number of preconditions and postconditions with respect to a procedure executed under test.\n\nI also sympathise with the view that SQL code is not 'democratised', as it were. I'm a Data Reliability Engineer, and I spend a lot of time helping engineers in product teams with the T-SQL and database aspects of their systems because - as you imply - the pool of application developers who are adept at working closely with databases is quite small (it's a niche area, and many developers are quite avoidant when it comes to working with complicated SQL).\n\nBut the main reason - I think - for an eagerness to avoid stored procedures is that they're simply out of fashion, and the software development industry is very fashion-driven.\n\nI'm not saying that's the case here, but I do think that - more often than not - it really does boil down to them being unsexy and unfashionable.",

It sounds like this backend highly couples the UI and database on various levels, especially if it literally inserts fragments of SQL statements straight from the request, without anything in between.

Most times the use of a JIT account triggers enhanced auditing to generate compliance evidence.  There are a few commercial systems out there that make this easy - honestly the hardest part is getting whiny engineers to stop complaining (spoken as a reformed whiner).\n\nI’ve used this genre of systems for both proactive/investigative and reactive/break-fix events.

With migrations and cqrs it basically means x3.🤣 Most of the time tho, dev access was nowhere near any critical table, and most of the restrictions come out of least privilege access principles.\n\nAs soon as we created a read only slave and a read only user for web crawlers, it was inevitable. I have no idea how people otherwise orchestrate mysql at scale, but didn't outgrow it either so it works well enough.\n\nAlso wrote bitbucket-r2d2 to manage 500+ bitbucket repositories (webhooks, cicd, just git pull with git-robot).

First, you’d need evidence that you applied the change in both dev and preprod successfully before they would consider doing it in prod. It took 1-3 days to get all the approvals needed (very difficult to get the same day turnaround unless a major production issue) and then you had to log on at 10PM or later and work with a devops engineer who would make the change on your behalf. Everything was documented and signed off on by multiple people. If you fucked something up with your change, they knew who to look for.\n\nThat’s one way to do it. In a startup though, there really shouldn’t be write access for normal engineers either. Maybe a senior engineer or two could have access to a special account but it should be really only for extreme emergency that it gets used. Otherwise you’re just asking for trouble.\n\nI worked for an early startup as my first job and we had no controls on the prod database and that went just as you’d expect it to go.",

In theory, high enough fanout of read traffic could also cause production issues, but we didn’t have a lot of work of that sort. I took over both projects that could trigger these problems, I didn’t go out of my way to advertise that the whole CD pipeline could be run from a dev machine using a service account I had Ops set up for it.\n\nWhen I took over the project, it was causing alerts and open circuit breakers in production if you ran it at during peak traffic, or while someone else was running a batch process. By the time I was done the warnings page said, “check if there’s an active incident happening and don’t run it” which really could be used to describe any CD task. \n\nI broke a few eggs in the process, but I only worked on it when I was in the on call rotation so I could own or dismiss any alerts that fired. And I made one of them run >3x faster and the other 20x faster while also making them behave. \n\nI’m also of the minority opinion that every process run by CD should also be able to be run by individuals in case your build servers are down, which did happen once there. They should have a run book, only be run by a pair of very senior developers, and only with a quorum of engineers assenting to the operation. Which is to say you should be able to fake every step of CD in a war room if everything has gone to hell in a hand basket. War Rooms, in any mature org, are the confluence of two errors working together to take out production. In a very mature org, that can grow to three. And one of those three can be Atlassian or GitHub shitting the bed. \n\nAs a side benefit, that sort of process transparency makes it easier for new engineers to suggest improvements to the process. Which can be opaque especially in Bamboo, which loves Information Hiding, which is an unconscionable behavior in CI/CD.

To be comfortable at CurrentLevel+1 you are expected to be able meet your CurrentLevel responsibilities without having it take up all your time. So if you're able to do CurrentLevel + 80% of CurrentLevel+1 for a year or so, you should have a good case for promo into CurrentLevel+1. \n\nThat being said, your manager should know when particularly time consuming responsibilities (eg crunch or oncall for CurrentLevel, or a bunch of allday meetings for CurrentLevel+1) get in the way for short periods of time. And if it's been 2-3 years of this as you say, either your manager's expectations of what you need to show don't align with reality, or they are stringing you along.

      "text": "So fifteen to rwenty years ago some engineers provisioned some servers and then were allowed to retire without passing on administration roles or knowledge.  By the time we got management on the \"succession planning is important\" page the horses had already left the barn.\n\nOne of the servers hosts SVN source control used by all our projects as well as the license server for some embedded compilers we use, and the other runs a web app used nationwide.  Government work, I'm being vague not because it's secret but just to keep things at a non-details level.\n\nIn government work, teams do not own our own IT and maintaining it is a pure cost for the internal team or external company contracted to do that, and the benefit of what is running on it is not known or a fuck given by the ones hosting.  This year, that IT org was like, \"your servers are on a really old version of windows; we're gonna turn em off.  k thx bye.\"\n\nWe had to beg for extensions.  Ironically I had been trying to find out where those servers were physically located and who pays their electric bill for several years, but somehow my attempts to find someone who could tell me that never connected with the attempts of the people where the servers lived to find out who depends on what's on them.\n\nTo me, from the moment I understood the situation this was slowly escalating from concerning to this is an emergency, but like watching a train wreck in slow motion.  Many other engineers I work with are either not programmers or embedded programmers who came up pre-internet or at least pre-Github, and not in the web tech or servers world.\n\nAnyway on the plus side I haven't gotten push back against moving the repos to Git (our agency has an internal hosted git provider), but on the other hand I have gotten a strange lack of reaction at all.  I have at least gotten management carte blanche now to spend my own time on making this migration happen, but I have asked for management support in getting affected engineers to devote some time to telling me how they want their projects to come through, and I never get a response.\n\nThe reason I need their responses is engineers were using the full flexibility of SVN both to create complex branching relationships and also misusing it out of ignorance, and one project in particular where every time they did a site they checked in another copy of the entire trunk and build folders (and trunk itself is GBs) produces a repo that really needs to be carved up.  Basically they were (are) using SVN like a cross between a monorepo and a share drive.\n\nI and a colleague are over here busting ass to make a nearly-technically-impossible transition happen smoothly but when we find something we can't \"magic\" our way out of if we ask, \"do you want the repo in Git to end up like option A or like option, because we can't bring it through unchanged?\" none of the affected individuals bothers to respond.  Even when I send emails with high importance and all caps, \"ATTN: either you will lose records of 20 years of work if this migration goes wrong or at the very least if you do not respond I will have to pick for you and if you don't like what I picked it won't be changeable later\" - no one responds/cares/expresses an opinion.\n\nThis is strange right?  I'm not taking crazy pills?",

Likewise, the stereotype of unengaged government workers really comes to bear with things like source control and other bits that aren't actually the code itself.\n\nThe warning is to not strongarm people through this when they DGAF. You're better off slow-walking it so they can acclimate themselves slowly. You probably don't have a bonus on the line or anything that forces a quick timeline. It will be frustrating, but you can get there with time. Do get a papertrail for people where possible as it sounds like you have been.\n\nYou're going to have an uphill battle your entire time within that organization. They don't generally want to fix anything. However, do look opportunistically for modernizing as you work on top-down projects that come your way. Do try to create a culture of appealing to their interests - git is a lot more marketable than svn, for example. Do keep in mind that \"efficiency\" is not an actual priority for most people or organizations. So, lastly, try not be frustrated and have patience while keeping yourself as marketable as possible in a \"legacy\" org/government agency.",

I build some sort of CRUD API, build out some frontend based on our designers figma mock ups using our internal UI libraries, figure out how to structure the schema to support the new data structure, do business logic with the data that got submitted, display the said data in an existing table, new table, whatever, rinse and repeat.\n\nI've been getting an itch that I'm not learning all too much so I want to start reading some books or take some external courses. It also doesn't help that I'm a self taught developer (Math major) so while I'm extremely happy that I'm kicking it in the \"big leagues\", I want to start challenging myself once again because it genuinely feels like everything I'm doing on a day to day basis are things that I taught myself via some random \"Full stack\" udemy course from 2020.\n\nSo with that said I wanted to ask you all the same question I've been wondering. What books or courses helped you on your journey to become a better developer? For what it's worth, I have the Udemy/Coursera subscriptions as well.\n\nMy initial thought was to read \"designing data-intensive applications\" but I heard that it's a thick book and a new volume is coming out because some info is dated. My next idea was to do Andrew Ngs machine leaning course and while I'd love to start learning some math and going into that rabbit hole, it really feels like a waste since I'll never get a job in that space and I'll never really use those skills again. Then finally, I landed on a course where I'll learn about Dev Ops (Docker, Kubernetes, setting up a CI/CD pipeline, etc) because that actually seems relevant if I were to ever do my own startup and dev ops is an area where I'm not knowledgeable (but tbh I'm not excited to learn about dev ops).\n\nAnyone want to share what books or courses that they genuinely found interesting apart from \"How to create a CRUD app\"?",

You’re still growing, but it doesn’t feel like growth because the problems aren’t stretching new muscles.\n\nDDIA is still worth reading even if some parts are dated. The value isn’t specific tech, it’s how it changes how you think about systems, tradeoffs, and failure modes. You don’t need to read it cover to cover either. Skimming chapters that map to things you actually touch can already sharpen your instincts.\n\nOne thing that helped me more than random courses was deliberately studying things adjacent to my job but not required by it. System design, distributed systems concepts, scalability tradeoffs, and even reading good postmortems. Those connect directly to senior level thinking without forcing you into a totally different domain like ML if you’re not going to use it.\n\nIf you ever want to stress test your understanding, practicing system design interviews is oddly effective even if you’re not actively interviewing. It forces you to reason end to end instead of living inside one service. I’ve used StealthCoder for that to keep structure when walking through designs, and it helped surface gaps I didn’t notice in day to day work.\n\nI’d avoid chasing courses just to feel productive. Pick things that change how you think about problems, not just add new tools. If you come away asking better questions during design reviews, that’s usually the sign it was worth it.",

Whatever is at the top of the queue takes priority in the moment and that's what is worked on\n\nAt first, this actually worked very very well for me. I was able to thrive because the most important thing was always clear to me. Until I went up a few engineering levels and then it wasn't. Because no other team was driven by a queue\n\nThis made things hard, it made things stressful... Hell, I even nearly left because of how inflexible I always felt\n\nBut point being, in the beginning, we were small. We had one product. Other teams drove our product, and as a result, drove the tooling we used\n\nSo we had capacity to only focus on the queue, knock items that existed in the queue out, and move on to the next thing. Easy.\n\nThen we were bigger. Now we have multiple products. Other teams began working on those. We were left to support existing and proven product. We were asked to take on tooling, escalations, etc that other teams had been working on. We did not have capacity. All we knew was the queue. To some people, the queue was the most important thing. To other people, speeding up our team through better tooling was the important thing. And to others, grand standing was the most important thing\n\nSenior engineers hated this. Senior engineers switched teams. Team was left with inexperienced engineers. Quality of product produced by team has significantly depreciated\n\nMe not at company anymore. Me at different company\n\nMe not know why start talking like this. Me weird sometimes, but me happy that my work isn't driven by a queue that's all important meanwhile having other priorities that me told are equally important by stupid management cross teams\n\nThank you",

Velocity was far far higher (for me personally probs 2-3x) on the low process team than the 3 other high process teams I worked on. And it wasn’t due to team size or company size, the low process team was the biggest team I’ve been on (8 engineers). \n\nThe reason is that I spent hours every day on process before, be it daily standup, point estimation, jira wrangling, triage meetings, prioritization meetings etc.. it often took more time deciding to work on something small than just doing it. \n\nMy last team (the low process team) eliminated most of that. We had our main projects, which were loosely determined by PMs and then given to us, a weekly standup, a weekly project sync and that was more or less that. When it came time to work on a project, we’d scope it out and design it within a small group and then just go. \n\nI can’t tell you how liberating it is to start coding days after starting the project instead of being bogged down on scope and design meetings for weeks. Occasionally our process meant we’d have to redo some work if our design was flawed, and for more complex projects we’d jump into prototypes in the beginning, but its still vastly faster than trying to perfect everything at the beginning. And all the pointless bike shedding is gone. \n\nThe best part of this is that I had all this time cleared out and we had the autonomy to just do things when we wanted to. Have some tech debt you want to clean up? Just spend a few hours, get a review and get it merged. The burden is unfathomably lower when you don’t have to justify it, track it, estimate it, triage it, and schedule it. \n\nLike I’m telling you we had the cleanest code base I’d ever seen. We had helper tools for days because people cared to do it and we had the autonomy to make it happen. Some of my most impactful changes happened on a whim when I’d be debugging something and decided to spend a few hours adding some diagnostics or whatever. \n\nI had this one project that I suspected would save us a good bit of money, but turned out we have no good way to get an accurate picture of team infrastructure cost. No worries, napkin math was enough, but I snooped further and saw we had all the raw cost event tables covering our team’s infrastructure in our data warehouse. So on a whim I spent a couple of days creating some team specific tables to make cost easier to calculate and a nice dashboard with various aggregations and charts.\n\nWell lo and behold I get a slack a few weeks later from higher up asking why we had a cost spike with X service. Turns out someone had shared the dashboard and they added it to their cost review resources. \n\nI didnt tell anyone I was making this, I just presented it to the team when it was done (then I think one of our PMs spread it around). At my old companies I doubt this would’ve been prioritized over project work, and we’d spend time discussing the rights aggregations and charts and what tables to make and blah blah blah and it would never happen.\n\nAnyways, sorry for my rant. I’m sure this won’t work on every team but it’s been such a breath of fresh air to “just do things” and I really don’t want to go back.",

What we do is create tasks when technical (invisible) work is needed and use it to make it visible for other stakeholders (product manager). It does not equate to having a heavyweight process around that, and honestly, it helps a lot: every dev is assigned a task, everyone can see what's being worked on, etc. And the best part is that rarely anyone outside of the dev team argues that those tasks are not needed.\n\nBefore, we had a horrible way of trying to squeeze that technical work into existing feature tickets, and it was painful because it did not give a real picture of what's happening. Now we can have a refactoring task that must be done before a feature can be delivered, and everyone is OK with that.",

The kanban process worked for us because we just adapted to it and when the ticket is that vague the developer's action item is to get on a zoom call with the product manager and babysit them through writing some actual tickets (then put those in the backlog for somebody to work on).  It wasn't perfect, because obviously developers would prefer not to do that, but over time some of the product managers learned how to just write reasonable requirements in the first place (and then regressed when upper management forced a different process across the whole company).  \n\nSAFe's a terrible fit for that because it assumes you've already got that \"Twitter, but for Dogs\" feature broken down into actionable/estimable tickets before the quarter starts, when in actuality you're forced to figure that shit out on the fly.",

          "text": "On the teams I've led I've always advocated for two rotations: focused dev work and KTLO (keeping the lights on). Focused dev is as you expect, you're heads down on a major feature or whatever and just doing the next step in the feature day in day out. When you're on KTLO you're doing things like production support, small bug fixes, technical debt, dealing with small client requests, etc. Another way to put it, one of you knows exactly what you're doing each day for the next week or month or however long that feature takes you to deliver while one of you swaps your tasks daily or even faster depending on what comes up. We do tend to have a KTLO backlog just to make sure you do have things to do, but your priorities will shift quite regularly. People on KTLO aren't part of the former so you're never stuck twiddling your thumbs.\n\nOur KTLO person rotates based on feature completion instead of weekly or whatever. That is to say, it's better to keep focused dev work going and people on task than it is to give KTLO people a break. In the long run it makes little difference and we found longer rotations were better for continuity, on both sides. We even got it to a point where it fell outside of our product capacity. We hired so product had at least the capacity we saw and then hired more to make sure we had this capacity as well. Yes, it got to a point where everything not on their radar fell into KTLO but we similarly planned and projected and hired accordingly. At times it was bad and we didn't have capacity and it kept being underfunded, but right now we're at a health size for this to work.\n\nMy two cents is that you have to plan for it. There will always be unexpected things that come up and the worst you can do is try to scramble to figure it out. However much capacity you may have for it you figure that out, but you need to have at least someone ready for it.",

The worst thing you can do is be afraid to clarify so that you do understand, and then become a problem for everyone else when it's clear you don't. In my role, that's my biggest pet peeve. It seems like folks often don't ask questions because it might make them look stupid or whatever. I don't give a shit about having to explain things multiple times in multiple ways. I actually view that as at least partially my fault for not communicating things effectively. The worst thing folks do in that situation is not speak up, because then when the misunderstanding becomes obvious, and it always does, it is at a time when it costs more time and patience to resolve than if they'd just asked repeatedly until they understood it. \n\nNow, there's always the chance that you just don't understand because of some shortcoming on your part. Again, this is something you'd be best figuring out sooner rather than later.

          "text": "I’ve heard many people over the years say something along the lines of “if you have the question, someone else probably does too, so ask the question.” Because of that, and the fact that I’ve found myself in a very high-trust team, I’ve started being more comfortable saying “I’m sorry, I don’t understand,” and then having them walk me through it step by step while I ask clarifying questions. If I didn’t get it the first or second or third time, the problem is usually that I’ve made a bad assumption, or there’s a logical leap or conclusion that I didn’t follow, and going through step by step - basically debugging the design or conclusion - is the way to figure out where the disconnect happened.\n\nBecoming the go-to person for something is a lagging signal of expertise and social proof. For building the expertise, there’s no substitute for curiosity. For instance, in our system, any time someone describes something the system does - like in on-call review or as part of an incident response - if I didn’t already know it, I dig into the code until I can trace for myself exactly how that works. Any time I hear about a feature that we want to write, I do a mini design myself to see where it aligns with our system and where it’s mismatched, and then I think of good ways to resolve the mismatch. Whenever I answer a question on Slack, I don’t just answer the question, I also try to think about the context of the question and understand that - why did this person ask this question? How did they end up coming to ME with it? Etc. and if appropriate I offer feedback on that. Do this enough, and you’ll become an expert naturally.\n\nThen the social proof - when discussions are happening, offer your knowledge. And the critical thinking you’re doing will lead you to develop opinions - offer them, too. Eventually people will remember that you helped them out or clarified something for them, and they’ll start going to you directly. And when they start recommending you to their peers, then you’re literally the go-to person.",

I'm talking about actual networking, like traffic flows, protocols, etc. \n\nFor reference I pursued my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering so I technically don't have the most traditional CS background and I have about 7+ years in the industry now focused on devops/SRE roles. I'm fine when it comes to writing code, best practices, observability, operations, IAC, troubleshooting, etc. I've designed and developed many microservices in my career since that's a big chunk of what I do but I barely know what DHCP is, or the fact that everything is \"dns\". \n\nI know how to make requests to api's and could maybe tell you it uses the tcp protocol, but I don't actually know what that protocol entails or how it works under the hood. I ssh into remote machines all the time, but I can't tell you what exactly is happening. Something about a tunnel being formed? Or tls? I just know that it's more secure, but I don't truly know how or why. Something something certificates. \n\nI just feel that in my career thus far, I've never had the reason, or opportunity to NEED to dive deeper into how networking actually works because many issues I've had to troubleshoot end up being at a much higher level.\n\nI recently had a recruiter reach out about a role and naturally I decided to give the interview a shot and the first technical screen came with alot of rapid fire questions about networking topics. I honestly couldn't answer a majority of them and it was quite embarrassing given I'm at least a mid-level engineer. \n\nso I was wondering if anyone had any resources for getting a better grasp on all of this? Because I'm sure if anything it will just be nice to read on something in my down time. ",

I don't have any good resources handy, as that was back before the web really had many of these things. What I will say is focus particularly on the \"layers\" concept when you do stumble upon the documentation. It all starts with the ethernet layer (MAC addresses and wires), then goes to the IP layer (connecting to physical machines) and then TCP/UDP on top of that (one has reliable delivery, the other does not (a gross oversimplification)), and then application-specific protocols build on top of that (HTTP). \n\nIt is one of the concepts that has served me well in ways you might not expect. Networking is more about streams of data, and that can be useful knowledge in other areas than just networking, for example writing binary file formats. They both have the same problem: serializing and deserializing data. Just think of it as sending nothing but a series of bits. It could be written to a socket, or it could be written to a file. but it's a stream nonetheless.\n\nThings like DNS try to make all this easier. Instead of memorizing IP addresses, it's like a phone book, where you can look people up by name. Everything like DNS builds on the fundamentals I laid out above.\n\nThis is why the \"layers\" concept is so important to get started here.",

You can learn a lot just by monitoring your network traffic while some services (like dhcp) are running, and investigating the packets you see with wireshark or tcpdump. Some of the RFCs are pretty short.\n\nLinux has and usually comes with all sorts of tools for dealing with networking stuff from the command line. rarp/arp, netstat, route, ufw and iptables, traceroute, tcpdump. You can combine those with grep, less, etc to analyze network activity.\n\nIf you want to try configuring some Cisco routers, we used a program in one of my classes called Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate networks and devices.\n\nIt's hard to know how far you are. Do you know the tcp 3-way handshake? Can you read and write a routing table? Do you understand the differences between TCP and UDP?  Can you read and write CIDR notation subnets? Do you know ARP and RARP and how they relate to MAC addresses? Can you successfully make SSH tunnels? Configure routing protocols? Configure a firewall? Create VLANs? Set up a DHCP server?

It was a lot of fun with fast pace, nice people, a lot of goodwill and a lot of chaos. Money was always tight and most of the perks I had before were non existent. I learned a lot and overall was a good experience.\n\nNot every declining company is a bad place to work at, but watch out for your skill growth and the financial trends of the company.\n\nNot every growing company is a good place. Watch out for culture and try to separate their self-hype from actual industry trends.",

Only approved software allowed on workstations (probably typical in some organizations) but in this case the approval process takes months, including for security patches on already approved software. The duration of the approval process isn't an indication of rigor of the vetting in this case. Automated software is used that takes about 10 mins to run before the stamp of approval is given. The remaining time is due to having multiple people required to check a box and pass it along. Most of the time, the process is stuck with someone in the chain and it needs to be escalated to get it moving. There seems to be a disconnected between the need to control the environment and the ability to quickly react to new vulnerabilities with patched software.\n2. Vulnerability checks on internal software libraries set up in *some* internal software project repositories, but are either: a) never run, b) have builds that are permanently broken, c) only run on 'main', d) are used to merely internally *record* vulnerabilities with no priority to fix, upgrade, or replace the library. Although I think it's a good start to identify these things, it appears that in some cases, without follow up, this starts to look like busy work (e.g., l*ook how much time we spent on 'security processes'*) without actually doing something about it.\n3. Vulnerability checks run on 3rd party software only. However, no security testing done on company generated code, even when a company has a dedicated security team. This includes checks for misconfiguration. \n4. Individuals with 'security' in their role's title (not necessarily C-level) being perpetually absent or unavailable from any real life security discussion. This can be either before, during, or after a very specific security problem. Occasionally, these individuals will even have presentations on the company's security internally which rarely reflects reality.\n\nI'm interested to hear if any of this sounds familiar or if I've just had bad luck. I'm looking for both sides of this though, examples of good and bad in your opinion.",

Just gotta live with that.  \n\nAnd honestly, I've seen several cases where a developer just didn't understand a legit security issue and tried to incorrectly argue that it was a false alarm.  There's some merit in just following the rule even if you don't know why the rule is in place and/or don't think it's applicable.  \n\nBut yeah, I think a green flag in an organization is if the person in charge of security seems to be actually trying to balance the impact it has on work, and is willing to take the time to try and explain why a measure is necessary.  The guy who just says \"shut up and check the box\", either because he doesn't understand the rule himself or because he doesn't want to take the time to explain, is a red flag.\n\nI think at the end of the day, a lot of actual security work is being done by people with really niche expertise that can't be scaled, so the only way to effectively make companies across the industry comply is to bring in box-checkers and try to provide them with a reasonable set of guidelines to enforce; so you're pretty much always going to have to deal with this problem.",

I show up to a meeting and it turns out they need $securityThing next week, but literally everyone else present knew about it for a year+. And now you get a solution thrown into production from procurement, to design, to review (also hastily done), no PoC, and now in production.. likely checking a box that customers care about. \n\nAnother challenge is hiring more experienced security folks. Guys worth their salt that truly understand developers pain cost as much as developers.. but they also don’t make you any money \n\nOn the topic of devs doing insecure stuff… unfortunately they don’t yell at the dev (not that anybody should be yelling).. they yell at me . Trust me, I’d love to leave you to your devices. I think beyond your typical vpn, endpoint monitoring, domain joining, and other network/cloud based tooling, we shouldn’t need to block devs much at the local level. But the dev goes and publishes a password for the umpteenth time, and now I’m getting yelled at for the umpteenth time. I tell them don’t do that, they roll their eyes because security is not in their job description and they’re not the ones whose livelihood is on the line if something happens. So now the annoying scanner is here and it takes longer to deploy. \n\nThe best orgs I’ve seen makes security everyone’s job. Having security champs embedded in dev and OPs teams to help make more secure services together as well as extending the function of security to catch these things early. Shifting left: get security involved early. If you’re adding new infra and other components involving permissions, networking, etc, get them in for a threat model review ASAP whether that’s the champs or the security team themselves. Get your management to buy in as well. Of course this is some pie in the sky stuff. Part of it is also just being in the “right” place. Where I’m at plenty of security are former devs. The scanner isn’t only for main, but for any branch. They provide hardened images for us to pull from for our OSes.  As long as it’s not explicitly black listed or pops the anti-virus, put whatever you want on your local machine… but in my experience in a lot of places, whatever bad things that can be done, will be done if you don’t try to restrict it.

Sometimes you really needed to know DB state to help with a support case or the quick fix was to flip some Boolean value but it would require a bazillion slack messages to get there.\n\nI ended up building a little tool for that's now my side project https://github.com/kviklet/kviklet it basically allows a PR like approval flow for SQL statements.\n\nI really wish this would exist for all kind of access patterns and it was configured so that your colleagues can approved most basic requests. Audit log in place peer reviews are usually good enough for most security standards. The really critical stuff can of course be configured or require management's approval.\n\nLong story short... it exists everywhere and fighting the theater is hard but possible.",

      "text": "For starters, I love OAuth, I think it's GREAT on paper. How it's implemented is what disappoints me. There are lots of optional specifications with various different interpretations that is ultimately driving developers to add more and more hacks into their implementations, and before you say \"never roll your own auth\", have you considered that the people behind your favorite auth libraries are also adding these hacks? Just because it's abstracted away doesn't mean there aren't hacks in the implementations.\n\nImplicit flow is one of my greatest pet peeves. Everyone says it's bad practice and inherently insecure to pass tokens in the browser URL, but if we were to force auth-code flow in ALL apps tomorrow, there is certainly going to be some major pushback. Furthermore, Some providers provide an `expires_in` and some just rely on the service to poll the token until they get an error before retrieving another token.\n\nThe lack of care given to validating tokens on the client side doesn't bother me as much, but it does concern me. Most will at the very least, check for expiration and issuer. Signing Keys is a hit or miss, some will check it, and some rely on the \"inherent security\" of the auth code flow or  [checks signature validity but not the signing certificate](https://docs.goauthentik.io/sys-mgmt/certificates/#certificate-considerations)\n\nDoes this bother anyone else?\n\nHonestly, I'm surprised there hasn't been more widespread breaches just from the lackluster implementation of OAuth as a standard.",

We keep running into weird concurrency issues and janky manual rollback code bugs since we have to manage our own transactions. Updates are really hard to write too since our data is now denormalized across so many different places, and migration and ETL scripts are a nightmare!\n4.

Zero downtime upgrades and mirroring are other good features.\n\nMostly, I think the major difference is in the _mindset_ of the developers, though. I've worked with quite a few people over the years whose default mental model of a software system is pretty much \"a reactive stream of Java objects\", and if that is how you think of it, then Mongo is a pretty obvious solution. Building your own Mongo with JSONB would just be extra steps.\n\nThat being said, I'd always point anyone who is in doubt towards Postgres, it closes off fewer options hosting wise and the relational model is just a really good default.",

I (really learned) ~all of the Neetcode 150 and it was sufficient for all my interviews.

I experience that every day, but I do not see those folks ever being truly happy. They are the ones that bitch about work and view it as a means to an end. I choose not to dig that rut. I'm one of those people that are happy when they can be out for a walk and thinking about a problem. You only get that when you actually give a shit about what you're working on. You'll hear the argument of \"they don't give a shit about you, so why should you give a shit about the work,\" and IMO if that's your argument, go be a plumber (pun, jabs intended). \n\nI work on stuff that is interesting to me, and I always try to find things that interest me. I can't see wanting to constantly looking for a job just so I could be judged by some asshole that spends their entire time googling or leaning on AI to solve their problems, but they work for a big company and have a cushy salary, so they must be smarter than me, right? I know what my talent is, and as long as I can put it to use, I'll happily avoid the 90% of judgmental asshats that work for these \"lucrative\" companies. \n\nThis whole leetcode culture never made any sense to me. We don't use it when interviewing. I actually don't really care to ask you to write code. I ask you point blank questions that I expect you to answer right there. I'm not even really looking to see if it's the right answer, I'm instead looking for honesty and passion. If you're the kind of person that is a natural problem solver and humble, you'll admit when you don't know something and it'll be clear how insignificant that is, because you'll figure it out. If I have to go through an experience like college, taking tests to get a job when I've been doing this for 20 years, I don't even want the fucking job. If you're not going to ask me about what I've worked on, which is the most important thing we should be talking about, because then you'll see my passion for my work, then I don't even want to work with you.\n\nSo, long story short, IMO those places that you're failing to join because you didn't pass some arbitrary test are not the kind of place I want to work.

If it's the latter, I'm probably not interested in working there anyway, so it's a blessing in disguise.\n\nIf you're not answering their questions in the way they want, then there's two explanations in my point of view: you don't have the skill they are looking for or they are unrealistic in the candidates they're looking for. Neither one of those scenarios defines a situation I want to work in, because I'm either not qualified or they're a bunch of elitist folks I have zero interest in working with.",

You don’t score points for finishing 30 minutes early. You might however lose points for not explaining your thought process clearly enough. So unless you aren’t finishing take a step back and confirm that speed is actually the issue. I do very well in interviews and I rarely finish more than maybe 10 minutes before the end of the interview (that’s usually when people plan for you to finish) and I only actually write the fully optimal answer maybe 70% of the time. I usually write and explain the realistic answer then tell them how to get from that to the optimal one. \n\nAgree to disagree that algorithms are idiotic. I have found at staff level knowing them has actually come up multiple times. And at this point I’m basically an SRE. \n\nI actually think that position might be why you don’t know the edge cases of the system design. Most edge cases are actually usually related to some really specific piece of how a system works. A system design interview isn’t testing that you know that thing it’s testing that you know how to think about that problem. So for example if someone asked why you would use weighted random over round robin or least outstanding requests it’s useful to know a bit about why those algorithms actually work. But you can ask follow up questions to the interviewer to get more info about the edge case to help you determine how to solve for it. \n\nThe one that comes up the most for me personally is dfs and bfs searches. But that might be industry related or just how I solve problems. \n\nWhat I can say is I think that you are likely too focused on the exact right answer and not focused enough on proving you can effectively work with other people. I’ve failed plenty of people who can parrot the textbook to me because they can’t actually talk to me about the problem. I’m not hiring someone to lock in a closet I’m hiring someone to help out the junior engineer that needs to upgrade sqlalchemy. \n\nAlso just a side note. I assume you are just complaining because it’s Reddit. But if you are giving the complaint about the other engineers as the reason you want a job swap it out. Without proof it is not possible to tell if they are the problem or you are, and you don’t want to make an interviewer guess.",

My org uses a pretty standard Java backend & React-based frontend. There's nothing special about it, and my team mostly writes a domain-specific app built into the wider company platform using standard (and some custom built) integrations.\n\nAnyway, all that to say, it's good work, and I like it, and I'm happy with my company/org/team (and vice-versa). However, it only offers so much variety in the sorts of technical problems I get to solve, and the tech stack itself is rather pedestrian. I did get into software engineering because it always fascinated me, and I really love the technical side of things. My 40 hours a week is *usually* enough to keep me feeling satisfied. Lately, though, I've had a stronger itch than usual, and been wanting to try out some personal projects, learn some new tech, even dive into more theoretical CS-y things.\n\nUndergrad was great because I could go deep on whatever interested me just through taking classes. I never much had personal side projects then, though, because I got enough out of my coursework and extracurriculars. I've dabbled a *tiny* bit before in trying to learn some new languages with different paradigms, but nothing stuck. Usually it just feels too artificial. I like to have some sort of problem solving to go with it instead of just \"memorize some syntax\" or something, but it's hard to come up with those problems on my own. So I've just never developed the skills needed to learn on my own.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions, or strategies they use? Like, ways to generate ideas for side projects if you want to get hands-on, or resources for teaching yourself something new (including learning about what topics are even out there to explore).\n\nIt feels like such a silly thing to ask, but I think it'd do me well for both my career and my personal satisfaction to work on these tools, to keep the intellectual spark alive.\n\nETA: A little late, but I've read all the replies!

I run them as local tests alongside unit tests, and also in the pipeline. I call them \"acceptance tests\", because I write them from the perspective of the user (not from perspective of ui). The ui is being called in tests, but is abstracted.\n\nLast 10 of my applications were like that:  \n\\- 300-600 acceptance tests (parallelized, tests on a running application) around 1-2 minutes for the whole suite  \n\\- 2000-3000 unit tests - for accidental complexity, domain, no mention of 3rd party usage, around 5-10 seconds for the whole suite.\n\n3rd party libraries, like db, ui, etc. are being exercised in acceptance tests; but logic is tested with unit tests just the library is abstracted away; unless the library can be unittestable too, like string helpers.\n\nMy approach is actually 4-layer approach by Dave Farley, author of Continuous Delivery.\n\nPS: As to who owns the tests - tests are owned by people who break them, because they're supposed to fix them. That's developers, so developers own all of those tests.\n\nMy developmental sequence would be like that:\n\n1. A pair needs to understand what work/problem the user has.\n2. A pair decised they'd do an expierment of what might work to solve the problem for the user.\n3. A pair expresses that as an example, and then writes that as a failing acceptance tests, they decide on an assertion that needs to initially fail.\n4. They write the driver for the acceptance test, so that it can click/fill buttons/inputs that don't exist yet. That already constraints a UI, which is a good thing.\n5. They create the ui and the necessary plumbing to go to the core/domain.\n6. They switch to unit tests, they write unit tests for the necessary logic in the domain.\n7. They stich the calls from the domain to the ui.\n8. They run the acceptance tests, if it passes, they're good to go. If it doesn't, they need to update the code so it works.\n9. Given the pair agrees on the acceptance and unit tests, they push it to the main branch, they're fairly confident in their code, because locally unit and acceptance tests work.\n10. The pipieline runs the tests, and if they pass the feature is deployed to production.\n11. The pair needs now to observe a user use that feature in production, and actually see that the feature solves the problem for the user. When they see it, their job is done.\n12. If the user uses the feature, but still didn't solve his issue or there is still some problems or bugs, that means experiment from 2. should count as invalidated, and the process 2.-11. repeats until a user achieves some benefit and the pair can observe it.\n\nIf the cycle 2.-12. takes too long, that means they took too big of a feature at once. They need to split it into smaller feature, and do 2.-12. cycle on something that can be achieved in 1-2 hours (3 hours tops).\n\nCode review was being done throughout the work by the pair, the tests have been executed throught the test. In steps 3., 6. and 8. they gather feedback on their design decisions, so they can correct the design while they're still working. This is very quick.\n\nThe approach can be desicribed as: TBD,CD,TDD,ATDD,CI,XP.",

Multiple meetings make the business understand that this stuff is not going to fly lightly, there are consequences of changing requirements half way through the project.\n\nI make the non-technical stakeholders sit through (boring to them!) technical explanations of what their request mean to our code, what would need to be refactored, etc. Sometimes they even backtrack and withdraw the changes to the level where I have to reassure them that some easier solution with 20% of work but delivering 80% of what they want can actually be done, lol :)",

That being said, this isn't a problem that we can expect to solve fully on our side (or a problem that we're absolutely right about), although we can make efforts to convince people higher up. And to some degree you cannot fully separate business and technical aspects, if someone wants to sell snake oil and is betting on all the wrong things that's not going to be good business.\n\nAlso, a lot of software development makes scope creep the normal mode of operation. This is somewhat inherent when trying to scale completely horizontally and just pile up features and execute ad-hoc work for whatever customer comes in. It's hard to tell them to stop piling up random stuff and shifting requirements, especially in a \"product\", because that's what they normally do and don't know any better (i.e. little vision beyond sales). (This isn't to say that ad-hoc stuff isn't needed, it's just a feeling that we're way overinvested in that market.)",

If you need quick response, you need slack and you need dedicated resources. This is why support teams sometimes have a reputation for either being a bit cushy and not having a lot to do, or for being overloaded and not being responsive enough. You can't have both and dev teams aren't any different, only that dev teams should be doing anything but firefighting and need protecting from that. If that can be justified as a whole-team thing, then sometimes having own or two developers on a team run \"interference\" and basically be allocated to non-critical work with the intent that they deal with any and all interruptions might be effective...or it might just normalise the practice and invite it to get worse.\n\nSome agile literature says that if a sprint is disrupted, it should end immediately, review and potentially retrospect, and a new one be planned. You might have some people baulk at the amount of overhead that introduces to the team if the interruptions are frequent enough, but it also might passive aggressively suggest that they should only interrupt when it is worth that cost, and there's always the counter-argument that it's none of their business as the team owns their process. You can probably tell, I'm not 100% sold on this approach and I've never seen it function personally, but there is some twisted logic to it.\n\nThe best pushback I've seen in the past is a strong product presence who understand what work is being done and insist on being in the loop to understand how anything might impact what they have planned (and who they might have promised it to and might have to mollify.) They're usually best placed to understand which priorities are being reordered and make that kind of call as long as the developers feed them enough information to understand what they're working with and what choices need to be made.",

I was offered a role at a large healthcare company helping to implement AI initiatives, vendor selections, build infrastructure, etc. \n\nI’m hitting some serious imposter syndrome because I’m not an \"AI guru.\" I’ve used the tech, but architecting a full stack is a new level for me, and I know I’ll have to do a ton of research to stay ahead. On top of that, I’m a \"solo\" mom aka my husband works a lot. I don’t have the luxury of working 80-hour weeks to grind through the learning curve; I have to be efficient and present for my kid.\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who stepped into a Lead/Architect role without being the absolute expert on day one. How did you handle the first 90 days of learning while building? How do you manage the mental load of a high-stakes role while being a primary parent? What do you wish you knew at the start?",

There's folks at your company who have been training QLoRA's at home (and capitalize it that way), have strong opinions about MCP servers and langgraph, and can tell you the purpose of QKV matrices in a transformer. Empower them. Don't steal credit, but this is a topic with a lot of passionate hobbyists out there, and as a Principle in AI you can get engineers who care about this topic but are working in FE or whatever a chance to actually meaningfully contribute. Executives love the idea this is super transformative and effects everyone. \"Finding\" talent within an organization is also appreciated. Reading groups, vendor evaluation teams, tiger teams, whatever. Use \"up-leveling\" others as an excuse to learn what you need to learn yourself.\n\nYou can also always fall back on \"this stuff changes so fast. How do we build in flexibility?\" It's a good idea in all software - avoiding vendor lock-in and such - but damn this field has changed over my lifetime. It's fundamentally a good technical direction anyways, but from a selfish perspective it shows you're \"forward looking\". And it gives you cover for mistakes you'll make. Oops, you bet on the wrong standard. That's ok, you were warning about this, you have a somewhat flexible architecture, choose a new horse and pivot.\n\nBeyond that, full time parent & top level technical employee is a beast of a combo. Be organized, use your time wisely, look for out of the box solutions (e.g. \"mentoring\" to learn yourself), look for high value to low effort solutions, lean on others (hackathons are a blast in AI), it's doable but the answer in your case can't ever be \"just grind\". That's good in one way, and there is always another solution in all but the direst circumstances, but that's the easy plan B so you've got to be making smart decisions every step.\n\nHonestly, there's far worse fields to be faking it in then AI, though. It's new, it's changing, there aren't \"right answers\", knowledge decays quickly. Play to your strengths, know and avoid your weaknesses, and you'll be fine.",

You’re standing at the seam where scope increases faster than certainty, and that’s what this role actually is.\n\nAlso, “AI guru” is mostly a marketing costume. The space is too broad, too fast, and too context-dependent for one person to be an expert in all of it. What a company really needs in a principal role is someone who can set boundaries, ask the right questions early, and keep decisions legible when things get weird.\n\nYour background across healthcare, aerospace, education, biotech is an advantage here. Those domains train the muscles that matter for AI work: safety thinking, auditability, consequence awareness, and knowing when “cool demo” is not “production-ready.”\n\nFor the first 90 days, the move is not to grind harder. It’s to control scope so you can learn while building without burning out.\n\nIn the first month, focus on mapping the terrain: what data exists, who owns it, what can be used, what cannot. Where outputs become decisions. Where mistakes are irreversible. Where regulatory and ethical risk concentrates. Where “AI initiative” is actually a proxy for process debt or leadership wishful thinking.\n\nMonth two is putting guardrails in place before momentum makes them politically expensive: define what success means, what failure looks like, what must be measured, what requires human review, and what is simply out of bounds. Set expectations that “we can do this” is not the same as “we can do this safely.”\n\nMonth three is enabling execution inside those constraints: pick one or two narrow, high-leverage projects where you can prove value and also prove governance. You don’t need to personally build everything. You need to make sure what gets built is understandable, testable, and recoverable when it fails.\n\nOn the parenting constraint: you’re right to reject the 80-hour myth. This kind of work is judgment-heavy. Exhaustion destroys judgment. The fastest way to fail is to try to outwork uncertainty instead of structuring it.\n\nOne practical tip that keeps “research” from becoming a second job: choose a small set of questions that actually change risk or architecture decisions, and ignore everything else until it matters. Most reading is not leverage.\n\nAlso, I’m in healthcare too. If you want to trade notes on what’s worked (and what’s bitten), I’m happy to.\n\nAnd if your org is looking at agentic workflows, delegated authority becomes the real hazard line. Once systems can invoke tools and take action, controllability matters more than model cleverness: scoping, gating, auditability, and fast revocation. I’ve been pushing an open spec for that control plane layer (DAS-1) here: https://github.com/forgedculture/das-1\n\nYou don’t need to be an “AI expert.” You need to be the person who makes the system governable while everyone else is trying to ship faster.",

      "text": "I'm working on a project that involves creating a new data store as a secondary index for some existing data, in an alternate database. I expect the secondary index schema to expand over time to encompass more data, so I see backfilling as, potentially, an incremental thing.\n\nIt feels like I keep encountering this problem over and over:\n\n* we want to run some backfill on all existing data\n* we know the backfill itself or the feature it enables is heavyweight enough to be somewhat risky -- there's a possibility we'll have to stop halfway through enablement and reconsider the whole thing\n* it's very important that we keep track of which individual things have and have not been backfilled, so that we can progressively enable new behavior\n* if the whole thing works really well, we'd like to eventually make it a core assumption of the system across all deployments -- deprecate and remove all code that was written without access to the backfilled data\n\nThe intuition in my head here is that we do enough schema migrations that we, like many teams, built a system and process to make them feel easy(-ish) and normal. But data migrations always feel like a one-off.\n\nWe're always building new tasks for our very generic job queue that loosely follow this \"migrate all the things pattern,\" writing new code for tracking the state of things that have and haven't been migrated, creating associated ramp flags as emergency off-ramps for the associated behavior, adding instrumentation that's extremely coupled to the rollout, etc. All easy things to do, individually, but it feels like there's a pattern here and it's driving me nuts that we're not optimized for it. It also feels like such a common need at scale that it ought to be a solved problem.\n\nWhat am I missing here? What do you all use for this, and did you build it yourselves?",

              "text": "Sure. In our primary data model, there's an unstructured blob of user-specified json data. That was originally stored in a json column in mysql. Eventually, we had users supplying blobs that were several mb compressed, and it became unsustainable to query the entire blob whenever a user needed to see some of their data.\n\nWe built a new schema that \"flattened\" these blobs into a table mapping dot-separated keys to values, and moved our writes to a queue so that we could do decoupled dual writing. We wrote a backfill job that would put an individual user's data on the new schema, and enable writes to it, and we picked out some high value customers to test with.\n\nNaturally, once the new schema was tried with real customer data, we found a bunch of inefficiencies. We made several backwards-incompatible revisions -- not a problem since we still had the old schema to fall back on, but every time we rolled out a new version of the new one, we had to temporarily disable it across the board, then trigger a manual backfill of the few customers we'd already onboarded. We also had some incidents where databases got overloaded serving the new schema and we had to ramp off individual customers.\n\nThis was a gigantic project, and two years later, we still don't have the new schema in use for every customer on all of our managed deployments. I have this (admittedly vague) sense that a lack of data migration infrastructure is part of the problem: we spent a lot of time writing elaborate systems to decouple the new and old schemas, performing manual backfills via our clunky in-house job queue, and arguing over the rollout pattern for our managed single tenant deployments, where engineers have less access to the system and where the sheer number of deployments makes manual job creation impractical (the job queue is, in its current form, incapable of operating across multiple deployments, and version lag between multi and single tenant would've made this tricky anyway).\n\nSo all this just feels... off to me. When we have schema migrations, we write and check in code for them, and they get deployed. When that code makes it to single tenant, they're deployed for single tenant. We write a lot of schema migrations, most of them are small and predictable, and if we really don't like something we did, a future schema migration can fix it forward.\n\nI think data migration is inherently a more complicated problem, but there still ought to be some way to build infra around it. We should be able to write a pr that defines a new column/table and a backfill, and just trust that it will make it out to every system. There should be observability tools that tag logs and metrics with the data version, like we tag for the commit SHAs of deploys. We should have a built in emergency stop button we can use if this thing turns out to be too taxing on the databases, just like we can always deploy a rollback version for multi tenant, or release a patch version for single tenant.\n\nWe can build all that stuff, but it seems unlikely to me that there isn't really good prior art in this domain. There must be companies larger than ours who've found a way to make this boring and predictable, right?",

                  "text": "My experience of data migrations is that while there are broad similarities that let you come up with patterns to follow, the specifics of every step are generally unique.\n\n* The shape of the old data is unique to this scenario\n\n* The shape of the new data is unique\n\n* The rules to translate from one to the other are unique\n\n* The datastores might not be unique (there's only so many databases), but there's a lot of combos!\n\n* The scenarios where the migration can go wrong are probably somewhat unique.\n\nIt sounds like you've tried to implement the same common pattern that will work - enable dual writes, trickle the existing data through, verify the integrity, cut over the reads. My guess is that your problem is that the people designing it haven't had a migration go wrong on them, so didn't realise the importance of the things you mention (monitoring, the ability to abort, importance of verification). I learnt by fucking it up - now you have too!\n\nDoing a proper job of writing a migration essentially involves creating the tool you want, specific to the needs of your situation. Hopefully it will be applicable to future migrations you might need to do. But it's unlikely it will be applicable to anyone else's migrations, which is why nobody has a tool ready for you to use.",

Represent updates to the primary data store as Kafka events and persist them in object store. That way you can represent backfills of new indices in the new data store as transformations of those events. The updates to the indices should also be represented as Kafka events. This should satisfy the backfill, pause, and restart use cases. \n\nOnce you have that in place it should be pretty straightforward to keep track of backfill metadata.
