      "text": "I recently read this Tweet from Andrej Karpathy (abbreviated):\n\n> I've never felt this much behind as a programmer ... I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year  ... Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.\n\nThis rhetoric about \"adapt or be left behind\" is something I've heard a million times over the last few years. For the longest time I've wrote these people off as being hype beasts, or shitty engineers. However, I'm starting to accept the possibility that the vibe coders are right.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I still believe that the majority of vibe coders are shit engineers. Code quality is on a downward trajectory, and I think we're looking towards a future where few people have the technical prowess to \"level-up\" to senior+. But I'm starting to think that the powers that be have invested so much time and money at this point that mass adoption of vibe coding in the software industry is inevitable.\n\nBut what's changed for me is that I'm beginning to accept that if software development continues to adopt AI, that I'm just going to have to find another career field. And that sucks, because I love programming. But I'd rather move to a different career field than become a glorified product manager. I know for some that \"it was never about the code,\" *but it's the only fucking thing I liked about this industry*.\n\nSo in the meantime I'll continue on as normal until management either forces me to become a vibe coder, or I get laid off for \"not performing.\"\n\nI don't know, getting that of my chest kinda feels good. I wonder if anyone else here is preparing for a similar exit in the short term future?\n\nPS: This post isn't to say that I don't use AI tools, or that I find them useless. I use Claude/ChatGPT every day for searching the internet, to answer small questions about libraries, double checking that I'm thinking about a problem correctly, etc.. I basically treat AI as a rubber duck. But it doesn't write the code for me, because that's the part I enjoy doing.",

If you're late to the game then everything you missed is probably out of date anyway and you can skip to the latest popular thing.\n\nMeanwhile knowing the actual fundamentals will still be valuable.\n\nI also think there's latent demand for software engineering. If AI helps reduce cost then we could end up seeing an increase in demand as more projects become viable.\n\nThere'll probably be AI slop janitor work too, for those brave enough to deal with it.

I do loath the prospect, since a lot of our stakeholders in my corner of the woods rely on government funding to offset developer cost and are turning to LLMs for when they can't find funding.

Where are all these use cases for 100 monkeys on 100 typewriters?\n\nI think LLM's are quite amazing and actually do have a lot of very useful capabilities, a few of which can be helpful for programming. Great way to get a quick summary of an existing codebase, maybe good for very simple and repeatable tasks like adding type annotations to python modules. Great for data entry and other tasks that are simple for humans but hard to automate.\n\nBut code generation? It just doesn't remotely make any sense with current generation LLM capabilities.

I used AI to help me get coverage on a few projects that were missing it before. When I actually checked what the tests were testing I was kind of shocked. The descriptions are fine, but the assertions don't match. The AI will fix the tests so they pass, even when they shouldn't. A bunch of tests said they were catching edge cases but they had mostly reverted to the happy path. Then they were duplicating a bunch of the same conditionals anyway.\n\nTests are supposed to ensure the module fulfills its contract. If a human never touches the file, what good can they possibly do? And if you're willing to rewrite the tests from scratch on every edit, why are you even writing them in the first place?",

I needed a Bazel rule to take a `rules_oci` output and turn it into a CPIO archive, so I've got a Go program to iterate over the files in the rootfs of a particular reference in an OCI layout directory and write them into a `newcx` CPIO archive. Writing the code was an obstacle I needed to overcome to keep tinkering with the architecture.\n\nGemini one-shotted \"Write a Go module matching the interface of `archive/tar.Reader` for iterating over the files in the flattened rootfs of a particular ref in an OCI layout directory,\" \"Write a Go module with an interface similar to `archive/tar.Writer` for writing CPIO archives in the `newcx` format used by the Linux Kernel to support extended file attributes on top of `newc`,\" and \"Write a Go program that takes a path as input, opens it with [OCI package path], which works like `archive/tar.Reader`, and writes an archive to stdout using [CPIO package path], which works like `archive/tar.Writer` but has the following header structure instead of `archive/tar.Header`.\" I was happy to outsource and have a working OS that night instead of hand-writing some relatively uninteresting code that is neither performance nor security sensitive and walks well-trodden ground in terms of API design.\n\nOn the other hand, I also enjoy high-performance computing. My friends and I will sometimes take an algorithm problem and pick a baseline machine to run it on and see who can get the computation done the fastest. I love drilling down into assembly-level optimization to get the fastest time. That kind of programming is enjoyable to me and I would hate to outsource it to AI even if I thought AI could do it well. Same goes for API design.

Give it grunt work, plenty of guardrails, review everything, reject anything I don’t fully understand, make it document everything thoroughly, etc. It lets me offload some things I don’t care to do, but I stay in control of my work and how much I use it. It’s a tool in my bag, not my job.",

Every time I join a new company they tell me how they do TDD or \"write tests\" and all they know is the test triangle and how use a basic test runner.\n\nThey don't know anything about factories, behavioral testing, shared behaviors, fuzzing, fault injection, mutation testing, etc. They don't know how to value tests. They don't know how to write valuable tests. They don't know how to maintain testing suites over time.\n\nThey barely know how to do E2E and often it turns into a ball of yarn. They often have no idea how to do maintainable visual difference testing.\n\nAnd the things they know put them in a corner, the testing triangle is dog shit and useless once you start actually getting into writing maintainable test suites for complex projects. Mocking, fixtures, and object mothering start working against you (they don't even know they're doing the last one). But these people persist because someone showed them the testing triangle and told them that unit tests are the best, integration tests are too hard to be worthwhile, and because of that they never learned to write spec helpers.\n\nAgile is the same way, Big data is the same way, webscale is the same way, microservices are the same way. Almost every industry trend is just managerial and product hype. I think in the late 2010's everyone just sorta gave up on \"engineering hype\" because the management class started getting feedback around how these things work in practice that they didn't care to hear.\n\nI had a company who was claiming their software was \"AI\" back in 2018. There was no \"AI\" there. I wrote most of the stuff they labeled \"AI\".",

Great, you can use AI tools effectively. The hard part of coding with an AI assistant is knowing how to code yourself. I might even argue that the people who aren't coding themselves any more are the ones being left behind in the AI era, not the ones having AI pump out as much code for them as possible.\n\nSure, there are some specific ways people work with these tools that might be of marginal utility to learn the details of, but there's pretty much nothing to learn that a competent engineer can't pick up in a week, if even that, and generally these \"techniques\" end up just becoming adopted natively by the tools themselves anyway.\n\nI mean, just go on Medium and scroll through the AI category. Every article promising some revolutionary new AI coding technique is just rehashing some minor AI-specific variation on what is already an industry-standard best practice like making a design document or breaking things up into smaller pieces.\n\nFor a good engineer, just knowing the basics of how LLMs handle context and what might result from clearing context or not having something in context that should be, should basically be all you need to know to get started. The difference between an absolute AI coding assistant wizard and a good engineer touching the tools for the first time really isn't that big. If the difference *is* big, it's just because one person isn't taking the time to actually understand in depth what's being created for them.\n\nThere's some interesting depth to be found in actually building a system that uses LLMs to probabilistically solve a problem that couldn't be solved before LLMs because it was too big a search space or too unstructured to be effectively solved with purely deterministic logic, but I'm gathering that's not what you're referring to. It seems like you're worried about yourself as a coder not using AI assistants heavily, and that I honestly think isn't something you should be worried about. At least, not in a, \"OMG I'm not learning valuable skills\" sense. I would keep my ear to the ground in regards to your employer forcing adoption of these tools in a shallow way, but otherwise I think it's never a bad move to keep your personal coding skills sharp. Those skills are the only difference between a vibe coder and an engineer with an assistant after all.",

I cannot be certain where LLM-created code came from.\n\nHell, some of it might be *my* old code, used to create a derivative work (the LLM model itself) contrary to the terms of its licence. If there's a grumpy old programmer class action lawsuit happening, please let me know and count me in.\n\nMany of us old farts learned to program, in part, by copying code listings from books and magazines. Yes, magazines full of source code used to exist!\n\nI don't advocate a return to this, but to this day, I don't copy and paste from Stack Exchange or places like that. I *always* type it in.\n\nThis forces me not to skim any part of the example, so I can understand and critically evaluate it all. Sometimes, example code leaves out things that are important in production code, like checking return values. Sometimes, there's an easy-to-miss detail that is actually very important in understanding how it works. You only catch this by forcing every single token through your brain.\n\nAI advocates are doing a lot of predicting of the future, so let me do one. I'm not going to put a time line on this, because I'm not a very good prognosticator, but here's something that a lot of us have seen coming for a while.\n\n\"Engineer\" is a legally protected word in all engineering fields *except* software engineering. If you build things that could hurt people if they fail, you carry certain responsibilities both to yourself and to society. The speed at which you construct things is a very small part of that.\n\nAs software takes over more of the world, there *is* a major disaster coming. There will be an event or series of events where many people die or are permanently injured by a software failure.\n\nI don't know in what form it will be. I also don't know when, but I fear that \"vibe coding\" is accelerating us towards it faster than it otherwise would have happened.\n\nIn a sense, it's already happening, only with data breaches rather than physical damage. We should certainly expect security exploits to increase in frequency as AI assistance increases. But that isn't quite enough to trigger what I'm pretty sure is going to happen.\n\nPart of the fallout from this inevitable disaster is that governments will insist that the software business *must* be regulated. Maybe not in the US, where the lobby is strong, but Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, etc will do it.\n\nAnd when that happens, you had better know how to take responsibility for your software if you want to keep doing what you love, and not offload that responsibility to LLMs.",

I think if the tool is getting better every month then what is the point staying on top of every new AI tool and technique out there. If you know the car will be cheaper and better every month, you would not buy a new one today and wait.\n\nThe AI vendor is trying to play double narrative of: It will become easier and easier to use AI to code to the point that we don't need engineer + If you are engineer, you need to learn and be expert in AI coding today. Honestly, I think the vendor have all incentive to make AI tool will become easier and easier to use.  So I don't think we need to always stay on top of everything.\n\nWill it be very easy to the point we don't need engineer? I don't think that is possible. But if that is the case, there is no point for us to become come good at \"AI Coding\" anyway. We should be all learn farming.\n\nDon't act out of fear.\n\nSecond, there is an assumption that writing and reading in English is more productive than code. Just few days ago, I worked in a PR where there are 200 lines of AI-generated plan with 10 code changes. I just simply, don't read the plan because reading code is easier.\n\nBefore this AI rush happening, when I went to fix the system there are a lot of times I find that reading the code itself is much better than reading the documentation. I used to try to understand how smart contract work and I find reading the code is much better than reading their white paper. I think the narrative of English is more productive make sense for managers, I don't think it always apply to engineer.\n\nLLM helps me in producing code. It can produce a lot of code really quick. I used it a lot when building new stuff. But I also can imagine myself finish tinkering code directly to make a small precise change that fix the production, while everyone is tinkering with a spec to have LLM make a correct change.\n\nThird, I don't find using AI destroy joy of programming. I don't think using AI turn you into product manager.  You still need a lot of engineering skill.\n\nFourth, the conversation has been too much around \"losing our jobs\". With that noise in the background, no grounded conversation around AI coding. When I speak and evaluate AI, I always say to myself, if I gonna lose my job, so be it.

We bemoan these non-technical folks literally devaluing our expertise in real time, and we're paying the price for it in terms of fewer job opportunities and janitorial work.\n\nI suspect, unsurprisingly and boringly, that the truth is somewhere in the middle.

With some help from a co-worker who's more pro AI than me, I set everything up. A .agent directory with helpful artifacts, a changelog, and conversation history to manage the context window, and a prompt. I was pleasantly surprised. Within a day, the agent managed to get pretty far in refactoring the code.\n\nThen I asked it to clean up the typing errors in the new code (they existed in the old codebase) and...it just started falling apart from there. It turned out that while it understood what I wanted to do and structured the new code accordingly, it more or less lifted the code completely as-is, type errors and all. It moved code to new modules where they made more sense (yay!), but then left the now broken imports alone in other modules (boo). It would fix type errors by...deleting the type hints. Etc.\n\nI blew through my usage limits trying to get it to un-fuck itself. My optimism gave way to disappointment. But I'm impressed enough to try and refine my approach and keep going at it.\n\nAfter I fix the type errors myself, though.",

Every job has a problem to solve. For most of us, it just so happened that the part we enjoyed, solving problems with code, was also what helped the businesses we worked for the most.\n\nTomorrow, if Dev + AI > Dev, we will have to adapt. Because at the end of the day, in a capitalist world, the only thing that matters is solving problems for people in the best way possible in exchange for money\n\nSo there are roughly two kinds of engineers from my pov\n\nThe first one likes to code, build fast, optimized, well architected, mantainable, and scalable systems. Their code is their art form, and they like their work because it allows them to practice that art all day long.\n\nThe second one is more focused on getting their work done and moving on to the next thing. They have always seen code as a tool to achieve a goal: moving the Jira ticket forward and getting paid at the end of the month. They may or may not enjoy coding as much as the first type, but at the end of the day, they are in it to move forward in their life, their job, their pay, or the business they work for.\n\nFrom the outside, those two people may look exactly the same: developers. But in reality, they are not playing the same game. Their intrinsic motivations are different.\nThese are, of course, caricatures. In reality, there is a spectrum between those two archetypes, and we are probably a bit of both.\n\nI used to lean more toward the first type and genuinely fell in love with this field because of the problem-solving it requires. The complexity of the systems we work with has always been a brain feeder and a real source of joy for me. But since the only thing I can really do is adapt to the industry shift, I want to learn to enjoy getting shit done more than enjoying the act of doing shit.\n\nNot because one is better than the other, but because that’s where the leverage is moving. I still care about quality and craft, but I no longer want them to be the point. The point is progress, impact, and momentum.\n\nThat’s the emotional shift I’m making: from loving the solution to loving the outcome. And I believe that moving forward this will help me keep enjoing this field.\n\nSide note: I also learned, as a failing entrepreneur, that building a company scratches the same mental itch as solving AdventOfCode problems. It is an optimization problem. (Less deterministic and requires a divers range of skillset)\n\nYou are searching for the right product, the right customer, the right distribution channel, the right pricing, the right partners, and the right growth loop. \nEvery decision affects the rest of the system. \nEvery mistake propagates. \nEvery win compounds.\n\nEvery part of a business is a stack in itself.\nThere is an engine to optimize: yourself.\nThere is a moving target: the market.\nThere are bugs: your blind spots, your execution failures, your wrong assumptions.\nThere is technical debt: bad habits, rushed decisions, misaligned incentives.\nThere are refactors: pivots, rebrands, restructurings.\nAnd just like with code, the same archetypes exist: system optimizers and needle movers.",

So the “AI is changing everything” thing feels less like a new era and more like the same thing getting turned up to 11.\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 is a better dev than most juniors I’ve worked with in the ways that matter day to day. It follows instructions, it has absurd breadth of knowledge (not depth, obviously), and it operates at a superhuman speed. I still love coding, but I think the realistic path is: keep coding anyway, both for the parts where LLMs reliably fail and for the parts where you need real taste and judgment, plus production hardening, tests, integration, debugging, and cleanup. And yeah, you should keep your hands on the keyboard regularly, because as DHH put it: when you “vibe code” too much, you can feel the competence leaking out.\n\nEmotionally, this is probably close to what the Luddites felt in the early 19th century. History wasn’t kind to them. You can hate the direction, but it’s hard to see it reversing when so much money and momentum is behind it. This is the worst it's ever going to be, and we are just starting out.\n\nWhere I fully agree with you is the “how do people level up to senior+” problem. If juniors grow up prompt-first, they won’t build the mental model you need to debug, design, and make good tradeoffs under pressure. If I were hiring for my small startup right now, I wouldn’t bet on a bunch of juniors. I’d hire an experienced senior who can lead and supervise a “team” of coding agents and ship. Juniors are kind of cooked unless they deliberately swim upstream and learn the fundamentals the hard way. Vast majority of them won't do this. Sad, but true.",

Partly while I am unemployed to learn how to use AI tools to their full extent and partly to see if I can build a fairly complex project with pure AI. So far, I am VERY impressed with the overall capabilities. I'll say that I've had to spend an inordinate amount of time redoing, re-prompting, undoing, etc.. it's far from perfect. But it is as good if not better than junior to mid engineers and frankly some of the code is senior+ easily. \n\nSo for me.. being unemployed for 2 years.. I thought.. well I am not going to become some ML/AI engineer.. but I will figure out how to use AI tools to help me get more done faster and try to learn how to prompt it so it puts out amazing code, etc at the same time. If I can learn that.. then maybe I can pick up a job again.. or.. build something for myself that can make me some extra money (well shit.. any money being unemployed).",

It’s not a perfect transpiler, but it seems to be improving rapidly.\n\nIt’s totally fine to not use or want to use new technologies in your job. There are still jobs available in 2026 for people who prefer to write in assembly instead of relying on a compiler to compile their C code. Similarly, I’d expect there to still be jobs available in 2036 for people who prefer to write their Typescript code by hand on a text editor rather than relying on an AI assistant.\n\nHere’s my perspective — I still enjoy reading assembly when I’m doing reverse engineering, and some times writing them by hand when it’s necessary… But I also love programming enough that I want to learn the new tools and languages available rather than be closed off in my walled assembly garden. I learned what I consider “old school high-level” languages when I first started: Common Lisp, C, Python, C++, Java. As the years went by, I also learned Typescript, Kotlin, Go, Zig, Rust, Haskell, Scala, and even more experimental stuff like Agda, Roc and Hylo just to stay abreast of the state of the art. Generative AI is the latest innovation in the programming language world, and it seems like the productivity gains from writing code in the highest-level language we have available (human language) is significant enough that it’s here to stay. IMO, I’m learning about and using generative AI _because_ I love programming; not in spite of it.",

And it's vitally important for the industry that it is in the right hands.\n\n\nRight now execs are buying the hype like it or not. Everyone is going in the AI direction. If you don't get on board you will be left behind. I'm an engineering manager and I've been heavily involved in AI for the past 3 years or so. Having AI skills is now a hard requirement in job ads in my company. If every company does the same then you're locked out of the industry. \n\n\nI've been a fan of AI from the start tbh (I wasn't a manager then). But I've always been frustrated with this industry in that 20% of the people do 80% of the work. I thought that maybe AI would bridge the gap and bring those low performers closer to the high performers.\n\n\nBut that has turned out totally wrong in my company at least. The high performers are now light years away from the rest. The best devs are seeing incredible gains from the tools. While the poor devs are doing worse. They are firing out PRs they don't understand, that take a long time to review and correct.\n\n\nAI is here to stay. So we need the good devs to get on board and shape the future. We can't have the poor devs or the product people getting carried away with their POCs. \n\n\nI understand the view of \"but coding is what I like doing\". I thought the same. But when you get good with these tools, you might come to realize like I have that it isn't the physical act of writing code that I enjoyed so much. It was solving problems that I really got enjoyment from. With the boost in productivity I can solve MORE problems now. I have never been so satisfied. \n\n\nBut the important part is getting this productivity boost without losing standards. But these are problems we've already solved as an industry. There has always been bad developers pushing poor code. But we have PRs, pipelines, linters, automated tests etc that are in place to enforce standards. Preventing slop should already be a solved problem. \n\n\nTLDR; the more good devs we have shaping the future, the better.",

If you work 12 hours today, you will be given 12 hours of work tomorrow. Budget cuts have also basically killed any chance of promotion or job security.\n\nWith this in mind, an intelligent developer has an incentive to actually deliver as little as possible. This makes their work more sustainable, and gives them a time buffer to start interviewing if layoff signs appear. \n\nIt’s not passion, but that’s how you survive in this industry. All the 12 hour guys burnout or get laid off and they’re too tired to grind leetcode. They end up living off the grid farming potatoes or something",

To meet our deadline it would require a solid week of work, including the weekend. That was my first hardcore push, we got free pizza, I worked a full Friday into the early AM, was told to go home and catch some sleep, and did it again on Saturday, I'm pretty sure I did Sunday afternoon in to early Monday morning \n\nAnd we were like semi-asked to do it in exchange for some short days in the future; but btwn me and the other dev it was like, no question \"yeah of course we'll work on the weekend, how else is this gonna get done?\" I even asked if one of my friends could pick up a few contract hours to help out. The whole thing was like, devoid of process, approval, etc.\n\nI was young and kinda generally just excited about the push to get this company site completed. And we did it.\n\nAnd yeah i guess - I do miss that collective 'get shit done' attitude and i still kinda carry that with me today, but i do have 2 kids now, my priorities have changed, though my motivation is to keep growing as an engineer so i can provide more for them. What helps is - I had a rather long phase of cruise-control, so now, late in my career - i'm actually learning a lot, and that part is pretty fulfilling as well.",

That only leads to:\n\n* Burnout\n* Bad estimates and misudnerstanding about time to delivery (your higher up will not have realistic expectations eventually)\n* Awful work culture, eventually the rest of the team that stops at 5pm will be looked down upon and you'll create some sort of obligation to stay late for everyone.\nAnd the list probably goes on.\n\nBut more importantly, on a personal level, there's nothing wrong with working only what you're paid for and having hobbies, family, or doing other activities that don't involve a screen if you really want to. Or coding a sideproject for fun too if you're really into it.\n\nThis \"ye olden good days\" seems more like a skewed vision of a workaholic to me..",

I've also met people who lived and breathed tech whenever conscious who were mid on their best days. I think for a lot of folks they conflate their age group and life path with something universal when it's not.\n\nFor example the mom who was absolutely magical with a database but saw it as a job and saw no reason to regularly stay at work late when she could spend that time with her children. Then there was the guy who was ex-Netscape who was talented but so laser focused he never noticed blind spots in his logic and reasoning.\n\nA lot of us \"hardcore\" coders back in the day basically amounted to hours upon hours of effectively unpaid labor for higher-ups and an unhealthy attachment to the job at hand rather than living life to its fullest. Don't get me wrong, I liked most of my coworkers, and I was engaged with the problems I was solving. I just also think about the opportunity costs the late sessions and predictable daily routine wrought.\n\nI have long since set aside the idealism that \"genuine passion\" would lead to better outcomes both personally and for society. For me it led to burnout more than once. Seeing the disdain that executives actually had for software professionals while they do mass layoffs in favor of AI only reinforces my conviction and cynicism. We should have unionized when we had the chance. Too many of us equated a healthy wage with security and are paying the price for it while executives just say, \"Oopsie!\" and try to pretend their bad AI strategies weren't warned against years ago.\n\nAlways remember that when someone tries to sway you with arguments of \"efficiency,\" be sure to clarify \"efficient for whom?\" The whole point of efficiency is to improve the lives of a greater number of people, not just efficiently siphon money into the accounts of the likes of Peter Thiel.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/YSp07P8jvYs\n\nIt took me a while to come to grips with the fact that too many of these tech moguls quite simply hate humanity as it exists and will only tolerate one that fits their comically ahistorical caricature of reality. And these are the folks in charge of the current AI \"revolution\"?\n\nThe naïveté of \"genuine passion for software\" helped get us into this mess. While software of course has a role to play, it's not the central player that will get us out of this.",

It wasn't until they stopped asking those questions a few years later that I realized how stressful it was, and it was years after that when I learned that most of my male peers in that time period hadn't had the same experience of being grilled to ensure they belonged before starting the rest of the interview. \"Passion\" is an emotional and subjective thing, and as such, can become a window for bias.\n\nAt the same time, when I was included, it felt so deeply affirming and magical - partly because it was such a rare experience back then. I was so used to be shunted into a \"woman\" or \"mom\" box that having my geeky, puzzle-solving, system-designing self seen by my peers just melted my heart. Still does, tbh\n\nOverall, I get to engage in more geeky deep-dives and design conversations and hobby chatter now than I did during the industry heyday of expecting passion for the role. One of the things I'm loving about my new tech lead role is getting to learn who is just how passionate about what, so I can help connect them with the work that will do the best job of scratching that itch (while, y'all know, providing business value). So, that kind of talk is still out there - it just happens in different spaces",

I came here after a twisting career path where I kept getting rewarded for being analytical, curious, helpful, and delivering useful products. But I didn’t study CS in school (I have a B.A.), and I never thought of myself as “great at computers” just “good at computers” because the guys I know who are great can do things I just don’t understand like build a game from scratch or set up a server.\n\nI became valuable at my job just from being curious about things and figuring them out, things that shouldn’t even be that difficult for tech savvy people like Excel, Google Tag Manager, writing SQL. I think the most naive assumption of my career was that people in IT were good at computers or even good at using the program of whatever field they are in (like expecting Marketing professionals to understand Facebook Ads.) \n\nA few examples of what I’m talking about: \n*Ecommerce Product Managers who don’t know about “Inspect” on our own website so they can check the CSS, or what’s being triggered in the Analytics platform, etc. \n\n*IT people who are so wildly unhelpful that I became the person to onboard new users into SharePoint because they wouldn’t do it.\n\n*Nobody in IT can write an API. \n\n*Having to explain architecture concepts over and over, but they are so process driven they just seem not to understand the intuition involved here.\n\nThe final straw was when we hired a data engineer making 2x my salary, and my SQL was better than his. I asked him why he went into Data and he said he had tried programming but it was too hard so he majored in data engineering. He wanted the money of a programmer but didn’t have the aptitude or the passion so he went for the “easier” field. For which he still had no passion nor aptitude. My manager had to fire him because he just was not good enough. Ironically. After that we became gun shy about hiring anyone with a relevant degree. \n\nI tell this story because I saw a shift in the attitude towards computers and learning that is really detrimental to business. At any given company I should not be one of the best people at troubleshooting computers and technical stuff. I am a data analyst with a creative arts degree. But I frequently am one of the best because IT just seems full of people who are phoning it in with no genuine passion for what they are doing.\n\nThen I think of 4 guys I know who are genuinely great at computers—3 of them don’t have jobs. It doesn’t make any sense. \n\nOne of them was out of work for years—he has a life science degree, no CS training except for programming for fun, but after tons of encouragement he entered some hacker challenges and now makes great money at a FAANG. \n\nThese are the kinds of people who just aren’t being supported to get hired. While my company is full of people who are frankly stupid. I have no idea how that works.\n\nI was very naive and thought that coding would be something everyone got a little better at, instead it’s another thing that got silo’d. Everyone on an Ecom team should know a little bit about how a website is put together; everyone in marketing should understand how platforms and algorithms work just basically. I see the effects of what you’re talking about every day and I just wish these people would do something ELSE.",

My actual work title has been \"Mad Computer Scientist\" since about 2000. \n\nI blame Agile/Scrum as the moment in time when that bullshit was adopted as when the software engineer profession failed to be fun anymore. I've been far far more lucky than most, and managed to evade Agile/Scrum all but once since they were adopted by the industry, and my time at that company was only about a year. \n\nI think I miss something similar as OP describes here: I miss the community of outsider brilliance that came with every computer science department, and every developer team. We all had an insight that we knew was not generally shared, and we had a curiosity about bending logic to our wills to create software that others thought could not and should not be possible. \n\nI also miss the lack of business mindsets and the drive to create \"celebrity\" companies. Despite having two MBAs now, after all these years, I miss when we all were driven by the newness of creating software doing things that had never been done before. I spent a good chunk of my career in 3D graphics research, and then animation production for games and film. Just being able to create animation at all used to be a significant achievement, and then we started making it visually seamless with filmed media (VFX) and we started adding physics to the animation and lighting equations, then actually implementing hair and fur, then realistic water, then realistic fabrics and animals. There used to be so many things to do that were doing them for the first time, and people cared that such work was being done. I don't see that anymore.\n\nI still write code, nearly every day. The level of work I do now is just ridiculous in comparison to what I expected. Software technology has exceeded what I expected to see in my lifetime in multiple areas. I just wish it were not still so hard to make a living at being a developer, with the insane demands we all are expected to just accept.",

I fought back with everything I had and instead of me getting fired I got 12 weeks of fully paid mental health FMLA. Our entire team was laid off within a month of me coming back.

I was that guy once, and it hurt to go back to SDE 2 temporarily.\n\nWhen transferring or interviewing externally, interviewers are looking for portability. Will you be able to be senior from day 1 or will you need **years** to ramp back up to senior? Evidence of joining new teams or initiatives, jumping in with new codebases, influencing beyond your immediate team, and mentoring help with that. Ironically, job hopping is also a good signal for this since it shows you can ramp up fast.",

It wouldn't be much in a niche engineering space where the software/hardware you work with has decades long life cycles or you just need working knowledge and it isn't available publicly.  You tell us nothing about your domain, so maybe you're qualified, maybe you aren't.  I have 30+ YoE and would not be any more qualified than you for some roles and you would be a more desirable hire.  In my current job I am the most senior (by relevant real-world experience) on the team by decades despite having a title one tier above the next highest.  At my previous company, at ~28 YoE, I was not the most senior by any measure and was the floor for being hired as a \"senior\".  Some companies just don't bother with `IC[1-9][0-9]+` tier systems externally or internally and they are expecting \"senior+++\" and maybe you are a \"senior+\".  YoE and \"senior\" is a simplification and you'll just run in to the above discrepancies over and over.  Don't get caught up in that.\n\nAs for the interview, don't treat it like a quiz or those coding challenge web sites.  It isn't a question of if you passed the test or answered all the questions.  Of course you should pass their trivia gauntlet, but it is important how you present yourself.  For example, you say here \"people come to me with questions, I own important features\".  That could be interpreted as you just being the guy that did one thing and you didn't hand it off so you are now the \"feature X\" guy.  If you proposed feature X, drove it from inception through to completion then passed it off to someone else to maintain then you mention that.  If that feature made your product better or saved/made the company money then you mention that.  Just answering the interviewers questions isn't enough.  I've had to make up questions the candidate could quickly answer to gracefully exit an interview where the candidate wasn't suitable.  Not because they didn't fit a YoE metric but because they underestimated the need to have the domain knowledge for the role we were hiring for.  Not saying that happened in your case, just illustrating how a successful interview from your end doesn't mean it was successful.  Senior also implies responsibility, autonomy and accountability.  If you aren't selling that through your experiences you choose to highlight then you should work on that.\n\nNot getting feedback?  Ask in your post-interview followup email.  Ask to get feedback from a specific person if you were interviewed by multiple people.  Sometimes you are the correct fit for a role, but another candidate was a more compelling hire.",

One point that other commenters have mentioned already is the fact that interviewing and working are different skillsets.\n\nSetting that aside, if you've been at your current role for a long time then a good amount of your seniority is local knowledge. That's just natural. I changed jobs recently and felt like a fraud because the seniors here are working at a crazy high level. I thought I was doing really badly. But other devs reassured me that I was doing fine. A lot of seniority is org-specific. I was at my last job for about 5 years so I had settled into this place where knowledge and expertise that felt so easy to me was actually accumulated over half a decade. Now I'm starting from scratch again and I'm not used to the feeling.\n\nAnother big point is simply that the job market and interview standards are kinda wacky right now. I don't even mean that the standards are high, though they are. But it's more than that; they've gotten really, *really* specific. What's happened in the past couple years is that any desirable job is getting slammed with applicants so employers are introducing whatever filters they can just to reduce the number of qualified applicants they need to sort through. They think they're raising their standards, but what they're actually doing is narrowing the *types* of skills and experience that get through. They end up filtering for candidates that know the exact tech stack that they use, and the exact minutiae about that tech stack that they happen to ask about in interview, whether or not those specific tests actually translate to how well a person can do the work day to day.\n\nYou might think they're kinda shooting themselves in the foot and missing out on really good candidates. They may be, but the truth is they're still slammed with applicants. They're still going to have their pick of the litter out of candidates who get through whatever arbitrary filters they apply.\n\nAt my last job, I wasn't running for the exit, I was being picky about what I applied to. Still I applied for probably several dozen jobs over the past 2.5 years, and only made the final round a single-digit number of times and ended up with two offers. The entire idea you were probably raised with, that you need to be the best candidate and they'll hire the best candidate, is a big lie. You need to be a top-tier candidate *and* you just need pure luck. And the only way to increase your odds is to apply to more things until you land the interview where you happen to tick all the boxes, even the pointless ones.",

For the fully remote positions, I had literally thousands of resumes to go through, so that was by far the hardest part of the process. The difference between people at the interview phase was super squishy, and probably came down to two main things:\n\n1. Someone might have had **a particular skill** we were actively looking for to round out the team's skills, like:\n   * they had deep experience customizing content management systems\n   * ... *or* was really strong/excited about doing front-end work\n2. or... they **stood out in some other way**, like: \n   * they were super friendly (you could see yourself wanting to work with them and people around you enjoying working with them)\n   * they had good business/product acumen - asking about how the business/product works, how we make money, what makes us special, how we think we'll win, how we see ourselves positioned in the market.\n   * they had an unusual mix of experience that you could see being useful (previous project manager, previous business analyst, etc...)\n   * they had a passion for something, by talking about something where their excitement got to shine.\n   * they showed somehow that they could pick up new skills easily or particularly enjoyed that aspect of the job\n\nFWIW, I did no coding/whiteboarding for any of these interviews - I just asked them questions about projects they've worked on, how they dealt with certain situations, and kind-of quizzed on certain specific information you'd need for the job... I assumed if they have worked for 5-10 years coding that they could do the physical act of using a keyboard to put code into an editor. I know... a bit revolutionary, lol.\n\nSo, with that said, proactively think about ways you could stand out and make it a point to pepper it in when answering questions -- that you're a go-to person people trust to ask question, have a sense of ownership of certain aspects of the product, highly reviewed during interviews -- that's potentially how you might stand out, but I'm sure you can think of something more.",

A LOT of companies are also a little drunk on the power they have now, because for so long the power was in our hands.\n\nIt's normal for a lack of outcomes to lead to challenging your identity, but the path forward is to try and flip that: use your identity to drive your outcomes. Practically speaking that means getting super clear on your strengths, get really good at telling stories, making sure you pass the competency bar (for many people they're good enough at this part), and asking unique questions.\n\nTreating the interview like a test usually backfires, as you're far less likely to do things to stand out (quite the opposite). After conducting hundreds of interviews myself, the people who stand out do the things listed above. The people who don't are so forgettable that we say things like \"Bob who?\" in hiring debriefs.\n\nMock interviews are also a great tactic to help get signal on technical readiness.\n\nThe tactics above have helped north of 80 people land offers in the past 3 years, so there's some evidence & reps behind them.",

They dont step back and think \"Man.. if it were me.. would I want to be interviewed like this\". Instead they think \"This dude is coming for my job.. I need to fuck with them and make sure the interview is WAY WAY harder than it needs to be and anything less than perfection is a failing grade\". And yet.. what double baffles me is most engineers I've worked with dont want to hire someone better than them. They may lose their job if the candidate they hire is better. So you  would think MOST would look to bring in a less capable engineer. Granted not everyone thinks like this. But I did.. and would. Because I always second guess my own abilities. \n\nToday it is much different because most of us now use AI, even those of us with 10, 20+ years of experience.. AI just solves most shit near instant.. saves us time and frankly often comes away with different \"angles\" to a prompt that can lead to better code from the billions of lines its trained on. Why not.. isn't the end goal the best code/etc you can put out as fast  as you can so you can produce more, faster so the product is out sooner and earns more money? If that's the end goal, you would think every company would be clamoring to have engineers learn to use LLMs to the best they can to produce more faster with less costs. Which is why despite so many responding (in other threads) that AI is NOT replacing coders.. I argue it is.. and will be ramping up as the next frontier models (Claud 5, ChatGPT 6, Gemini 4) etc hit the market this year sometime. They will inevitably be on par with if not surpass senior+ engineers in most tasks. Still dont think you'll get AI to make an OS or a video game.. but the smaller tasks are as good if not better given how much more data it has than any engineer does to pull from.",

I use an AI code review tool or LLM model to do the first review. It helps me find things I used to miss, like N+1 queries or performance issues etc. I am learning from it, and now I am asking my team to use it too before raising PR so that we can all learn and try to mitigate those risky condition. \n\nWe can't be perfect always.

If the code being submitted actually *needs* frequent review and problems happen if it isn't, that a red flag. Not a code red flag, but either a process red flag or a personnel red flag. In this age of AI, it's an ideal tool to prevent AI slop from polluting your code.\n\nIt is possible, on occasion, to spot an actual bug via code review, and that's a nice benefit, but in general it is not the goal. Reviewers' brains are not compilers or IDEs. We cannot just read code and tell exactly what it does without testing it. We might have a good idea of what it does and whether it works correctly, but the final arbiter is always QA (or failing that, your users now turned into beta testers).\n\nIn my experience, code review has been relied on to make sure contractors and outsourced engineers don't infect your code with their slop. Those people will often find their code changes blocked or rejected outright, especially if they are still new to your team's coding standards. Contrariwise, people who have been working together for years will review code, but with an eye to asking \"Is this doing anything unreasonable?\" with respect to architecture, scalability, code style, and so on. If the org has a prohibition against inline SQL, for example, this is where to catch it. As long as there's nothing obviously wrong, the PR will pass and be merged, relying on automated tests and manual QA to find any issue. I have never had any issue with another dev making a comment to fix something up. It's either a reasonable ask or I can explain why in this case their suggestion would break assumptions of which they are unaware, and so on.",

Having worked on teams with different cultures, here are all the ways I’ve seen them used with each being appropriate for their environment\n\n1) A way more senior developers interact with a larger set of work and keep the team aligned and on the right track. People who review much more than they write\n2) A way to gently expose Juniors to more Senior work. Expectation they try to engage with it and ask questions. The reviews themselves serve as knowledge for new Juniors to read and grow from to understand historical context.\n3) A way to reduce the # of bugs by (% of bugs)^(# reviewers). Hard to say how closely it follows that equation (never seen it outright measured) but bugs getting caught is definitely common enough on a sprint basis that it is absolutely valid. In a similar fashion, ensuring test coverage is sufficient to prevent accidental bugs from being introduced later, because of unintended behavior changes that were not codified.\n4) A way to keep semi-formal standards that are not made easily automated held by the group. A way for the team to shape those standards by discussing. Can be seen as just nits often, but reveals what the team considers a nit and smoothens collaboration expectations by exposing them.\n5) (IMO, generally the most important) A way to ensure redundancy of understanding between changes and feature areas overtime. No change is understood by only 1 person allowing for the team to always be cross collaborating effectively over a longer period of time. \n\nIf you can’t point to how a PR review is adding value to your team, then generally voice that and aim for some type of fix. I’ve also seen teams that did not do PR reviews which allowed any of the above problems to creep in as a systematic culture problem that was difficult to reverse",

Not async comments. Not a Loom video. You and me, screen share, explain what this code does and why you made these choices.\n\n> First week, guy shows up with a 600-line PR. Gets about 3 minutes in and realizes he can’t explain what half of it does. Closes the meeting, comes back two days later with a 90-line PR that actually makes sense.\n\n> Now most PRs are under 100 lines. People are breaking things up because they know they’ll have to defend it live. And when they can’t explain something, they go back and either figure it out or rewrite it before the meeting.\n\n> It’s not perfect. Some people hate it. But review time dropped and I’m not just rubber stamping AI slop anymore.\n\n> What'd u do?",

I was talking to someone at work recently about the entry level position they're trying to fill, and they said they've been completely inundated with applicants, far more than we've gotten in the past.\n\nThis makes sense given the state of the industry, but they're bumping into a new issue: a ton of people are straight up lying about their qualifications, which bumps them to the top of the list, but then the screening comes and they're very obviously just plugging questions into an LLM and waiting to spit the answer back out. When pressed for details about their decision making, they come up blank.\n\nThe biggest issue is that these people, who are presumably taking the job posting and running it through some AI to create the perfect application, are probably pushing down the applicants who *actually* have the experience we're looking for. We don't hire super often, so I'm wondering if places that have dealt with this more often have solutions?",

At the time I thought he was joking - how can I, a junior, even approach much less understand the code in the standard library.\n\nTurns out, after deepening my fundamentals, reading multiple of the canonical books, participating in open source and years of writing/reading code, I no longer feel the same fear to approach any codebase in my main languages.\n\n(Humble) bragging aside, in my experience to be able to *read* code effectively you have to know the language/runtime and most if not all the language features. And this takes a lot of time - in the hundreds to the thousands of hours. \n\nTime investment that's not always judged as practical by most developers. And to be honest, it mostly isn't - often you have some very opinionated framework and you are left developing more or less trivial code in lots of places. So they end up using and being comfortable with a very limited subset of patterns and language/runtime capabilities.\n\nNow, with the use of LLMs the same people have to read and evaluate a lot more code:\n\n* code that may use patterns they have not encountered before \n* code using language constructs they are only vaguely familiar with\n* code relying on some implicit runtime/framework behavior they are not aware of\n* code that's actually using subtle anti-patterns \n* code that's just wrong/hallucinated\n\nExpensive option would be to try to understand everything by prompting the LLM for explanations. However, they might have lots of blind spots, or just think they understand something they actually learned the wrong way. Of course, the LLM might just provide plausible but still misleading explanations - again only something an expert can discern. Unknown unknowns might surface that require a lot of extra-study... that's all very uncomfortable and is not helping very much for their current task.\n\nLess expensive option would be to push the code that they convince themselves they kinda understand and trust the LLM. After all it appears to work. And voila, they've produced slop for others to review and maintain. \n\nNot sure if devs are solely to blame. For as long as I can remember, people were asked to be generalists, rely on frameworks which were doing the heavy lifting, be language-agnostic, not dig too deep into trivia, look things up instead of actually internalizing them etc etc. And now instead of just writing their simple glue code they have to read and evaluate a superset of what they know - running the code and observing behavior being the only real means they have left to judge its \"correctness\".\n\n",

Not sure if you read this old article [\"Code Isn't Literature\"](https://gigamonkeys.com/code-reading/) but I think it is instructive.\n\n> First, when I did my book of interviews with programmers, Coders at Work, I asked pretty much everyone about code reading. And while most of them said it was important and that programmers should do it more, when I asked them about what code they had read recently, very few of them had any great answers. Some of them had done some serious code reading as young hackers but almost no one seemed to have a regular habit of reading code. Knuth, the great synthesizer of computer science, does seem to read a lot of code and Brad Fitzpatrick was able to talk about several pieces of open source code that he had read just for the heck of it. But they were the exceptions.\n>\n> If that wasn’t enough, after I finished Coders I had a chance to interview Hal Abelson, the famous MIT professor and co-author of the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. The first time I talked to him I asked my usual question about reading code and he gave the standard answer—that it was important and we should do it more. But he too failed to name any code he had read recently other than code he was obliged to: reviewing co-workers’ code at Google where he was on sabbatical and grading student code at MIT. Later I asked him about this disconnect:\n>\n> [...]\n> > Abelson: Yeah. You’re right. But remember, a lot of times you crud up a program to make it finally work and do all of the things that you need it to do, so there’s a lot of extraneous stuff around there that isn’t the core idea.\n>>\n>> Seibel: So basically you’re saying that in the end, most code isn’t worth reading?\n>>\n>> Abelson: Or it’s built from an initial plan or some kind of pseudocode.

As a mid-level engineer (5yoe) who aspires to be Staff one day, I've chosen not to use LLMs in my coding as I think it will hinder my mental model of my codebase. Many of the senior+ engineer that I know have built their mental model of the codebase through their own experiences with implementing features and fixing bugs in that codebase. \n\nI see a lot of people who advocate for using LLMs in coding saying that it helps them automate the \"boring, low-level\" details of programming and helps them focus on the higher level architecture of the problem. Or that juniors could just learn the higher level software engineering/product skills and have agents do all of the coding. But working at that level of abstraction is **hard** even if you have the lower level knowledge of the codebase. I'm not convinced that juniors relying on LLMs to do most of the coding and explaining of the codebase could build the domain knowledge and intuition required to make higher-level decisions about codebases at a staff+ level.",

      "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI've been doing frontend development for about 9 years now, mostly building websites for the first 3 years (worked in digital agencies) and last 6 with intermittently building and maintaining public web applications at my in-house role at a blue-collar company. I was laid off in November 2025 due to restructuring after 6 years from this role, where I was the only frontend dev on a small marketing team, working fully remote. I live about a 1.5-2 hour commute from a couple of major tech hub. There aren't many jobs around me, for what I do, at all.\n\nMy work there was mostly incremental. Small features on existing web apps, CMS updates, and occasional larger projects building 0 to 1 frontend web apps in React. Whatever the business needed from a frontend perspective.\n\nI've never had to do take-home tests, coding challenges, or live coding interviews in my career. It was always a 1-hour discussion of my experience, some basic technical questions, and then an offer.\n\nSince being laid off, I've been applying to frontend roles, and I’ve been trying to break into full stack development since I see a lot of those (built a hefty side project and threw it on my GitHub - struggled through it, learned a ton of new things), but the interviews I’ve faced have been… very different:\n\n* Live coding challenges or HackerRank/HackerEarth tests that expect you to know everything by heart. I’ve always Googled or asked AI for help in my work, so this is completely new. I haven't seen any Leetcode.\n* Random, rapid-fire questions, especially on backend topics where my experience is limited or super advanced frontend topics I've never had to take into account during real-world work.\n\nI won't go through all of my interview experiences, but so far, I've been rejected by most of them - specifically after the HackerRank/HackerEarth/live-code portion. After applying to a senior frontend position, and having a live-code portion with a senior frontender, he point blank told me at the end that I should not be applying to senior roles. He also said some other insulting things. He could tell I was visibly tearing up. He apologized. I don't know if he's right, but it really hit me. I see so many senior roles, and it makes me think I'm not good enough for them based on my experience.\n\nI have two young kids. My days often start chaotic, which doesn’t help anxiety and uncertainty around job hunting. My kids are extremely stressful at their age (2 and 6), I'm also not sleeping well at all because of the 2 year old + life situation stress. \n\nI’m trying to stay positive, but I’m struggling with how to effectively prepare for these technical interviews, and how to practice for coding challenges/live coding without burning out. In the past, I would usually get a job within 3 weeks of applying, with interviews from about 50% of applications. Now it feels like 5%, and it's been over 2 months. So many rejections. The whole process is overwhelming.\n\nI had an emotional breakdown last Tuesday in our garage. I broke down at my parents twice in the past month as well. I am seriously, seriously mentally struggling. When my wife and kids leave, and I'm alone, I can barely muster up the strength to go down to my office and sit in front of my computer. It's becoming a place I hate.\n\nSometimes, I breakdown in front of my kids. They ask my wife, \"why is daddy crying\". I feel ashamed. I haven't engaged in any hobbies that I regularly did before the layoff - like play guitar, video games, consistently going to the gym. I don't see the colour in my life anymore.\n\nIf anyone has any practical strategies for passing coding challenges/live coding, in terms of ways I can practice in the afternoons, I’d really appreciate your advice. My current daily, Monday to Friday is:\n\n\\- Helping kids get out the door - always chaotic and stressful.  \n\\- Applying to jobs from 9am - 12pm.  \n\\- Building a React to do app over and over so it's memorized, because I don't know how else to prepare for live-code tests.\n\nMaybe in the afternoons I can practice, but I really just don't know what I should be doing, because every single test is different. I don't know what kind of test will be thrown at me. Any advice here would be very, very helpful. I wish things would go back to the way they were. Talk about my experienced, tech talk, then offer. Especially with a young family.\n\nI just want to understand how to bridge this gap and get back to doing the work I love without losing my mind. \n\nMy mental health is already in a downward spiral. If you could please be kind, I would really appreciate it.",

I also have young kids, and I get it man. I'm 90% out of my spoons for the day when I start my work in the morning.\n\nThe interview process is pretty insane for our industry, and it feels like every startup or established business  is after a \"rock star developer\" or seems to think they are Google. 10 stage interview process, \"quick\" take home projects, LeetCode challenges, meet the founders, cultural fit, meet HR for a stress test, reverse a LinkedList for the first time in 15 years, etc etc. It's insane to me - imagine asking a plumber with years of experience to do something like that?\n\nThat senior guy was a dick. He made a judgement about you based on a very limited duration of interaction with you, and reduced you to that one thing that you \"failed\" in his eyes. Did he see that you're able to learn? Did he understand that not everyone knows everything and the best hires tend to be people with good soft skills that have an interest in learning and fitting into the team? Did he at least explain his reasoning, and talk the problem through *with* you? ie. how the real world works when you're peer programming? Sounds like he gave you some insight to what it's like working there.\n\n>I see so many senior roles, and it makes me think I'm not good enough for them based on my experience.\n\nJust want to address this too. Always keep in mind that they're asking for 150% of what they want in the role, but will settle on 75%. You have skills, and interviews are a two-way process. You're checking to see if they're a good fit for you as well.\n\nIt's tough out there, and hard to stay positive some days. Just remember it's OK to call a shitty situation a shitty situation - and be kind to yourself! You know more than you think you do, and you managed to stay employed for 6 whole years until the bottom line of the company forced a restructure. I've been in places where people didn't last a month lol.\n\nHave you contacted a recruiter? That's usually your best bet, they are good at working on your behalf and finding vacancies that suit your profile. Good hunting!",

The industry is going through a bunch of turmoil and it’s causing us to have to reapproach how we look at our careers. The way we prep for interviews now is vastly different and it’s intimidating and frankly a bit scary because it feels like everything is on the line. I know you know technical content and you have the ability to do the job. What’s challenging you right now is the mental blocks and the psyching yourself out based around things out of your control. it’s the case where entering these interviews a lot of the content you have in your head can go out the window due to the stress. I highly encourage you to get back on a routine where you reduce the stress. This can include talking to someone, working out (research has shown a daily workout routine does just as much for stress reduction as attending therapy), taking a walk for 30 mins with the kids in the morning. It’s really really important you get that under control first, especially for your kids. You are their everything. And they are the most important thing. The job cycles will come and go. You once had the passion for it and maybe you can rediscover it in some way.\n\nOnce you have a bit of a self care routine down, start slowly reintroducing studying, a couple hours a day max to start. This will help immensely for getting through these coding rounds. The best way I learn is taking an accepted solution, walking through it out loud with how I understand it, watch the explanation and algorithm videos, try to write it out myself in a slightly different way with my own style. Once I get comfortable with enough of these I then tackle similar problems, leetcode lets you know which problems are similar enough. You can’t all or nothing this though as you’ll burn out really quickly. You’re clearly doing something right enough to MAKE it to these coding rounds. You’ll be able to close on one of them once you get your confidence back. There are tons of discord groups you can join in this space as well where you can ask questions and find study partners.\n\nI wish you all the luck in the world. What you’re doing is immensely important and also difficult. I have two young children of my own. We will power through this and land a position soon.",

I had a lot of days I couldn’t muster the energy to prep. It took me about 6 months to find a job again and even with it now it’s not a job I want, but it pays and I’m coding. \n\nYour first priority is making sure your family’s boat isn’t sinking. Enough savings and income and unemployment to keep the house/rent paid, lights/heat on, and health insurance/childcare. \n\nIf you can’t make those then cut back as hard as you can until you can, or find contingencies. When I was unemployed I briefly worked at my daughter’s daycare because they gave us a discount on the cost. It helped stem the tide of not having work and gave me breathing room. \n\nNext, time to get competitive. Learn to do leetcode, read about system design, and study. Make it like weight lifting reps. 3 reps of leetcode (a set) per day, as much from memory as you can. Write it down, recall it from memory. Study “how to memorize things” and keep at it. \n\nThe prep will suck. I’m in it now too. The interviews will suck more, they’ll rob you of your confidence. But know that any of those interviewers see you and think “there but for the grace of God go I”, none of us are safe and it’s scary. \n\nHang tough, ask for help. DM if you need it. ",

          "text": "As pretty much everyone else said.. you are far from alone. I am 25+ years experience.. out of work for 2 years now. I've not been going hard core because a) I have ALWAYS sucked at leet code.. lucky to have gotten jobs through contacts that mostly got me bypassed from leetcode rounds. But this time around.. there are easily 1000x more developers competing for same roles, and most are in their 20s to 30s.. I am in my 50s. While I am luckily not gray hair so I dont quite look in my 50s.. I am still clearly older. I've had to redo my resume to remove 15 years of history off of it to have a shot at anything because I'd wager 1 in 1000 older devs get past the AI screen for a HR call. NOBODY wants older devs. 20 years ago.. a 45+ year old dev was a Godsend. Someone with insane knowledge, could lead a team, calm, make decisions, etc. TODAY.. nope. They want 25 to 30 year olds with 3 to 5 years doing interviews, and anyone past about 40 except in the rare case they have no interest in hiring.\n\nYou add AI to the mix and all the hype its gotten this past year especially.. with plethora of company's saying they wont hire junior to mid level engineers any more due to AI tools good enough to do the work they did.. and then you add the insane amounts of outsourcing which should be fucking illegal giving away American jobs for cheap labor.. and well.. you have the perfect storm of the absolute worse our industry has seen by far. Many will argue 2008 was as bad if not worse. Nope.. not even close. But I'll save that argument for another thread/time.\n\nMy only saving grace is my kids are 21+ years old even though 2 still live at home and I pay for them.. while being unemployed. I am gearing up for a divorce too.. so shit sucks badly right now.\n\nMy only hope is this last 6 months or so I doubled down on AI tooling to try to learn how to use it to build something that I think the industry still has room for. No clue if it will pan out but its my last attempt in this tech field. If this doesn't work out.. its literally $20 an hour jobs (or less) and finding middle aged room mates who keep to themselves and hopefully can afford a rental room to live in. No clue what else to do. Going from 250K + benefits to 0 income and no benefits.. to possibly a 40K job with probably no benefits is insane in your 50s.. supposed to get better, not worse. But this market, esp in the US but I understand its world wide.. is awful. For millions. The numbers are way off on those not working or struggling too. 4.3% my ass. It's WAY more than that. I'd argue a solid 10% to 15% of the population is out of work or unable to find work that pays the bills.. let alone saving for retirement. \n\nSo one thing I'd suggest.. while you're off.. pick up Golang for back end. It's the easiest language to learn, its used more and more for APIs, database work, microservices and back end stuff. Sure typescript is there too if you want to use that, but having a 2nd language, esp one you can learn in a week shows you are learning and not sitting around. At least somewhat. Start some projects.. like building a back end that provides APIs and build a front end GUI that calls those APIs. add in some go-migrate for db migration stuff to show you can migrate DB changes to the schemas, etc. BUT USE AI! If you have the means, pay for claude code.. $100 a month gets you a pretty good amount of weekly usable AI stuff, and learn how to prompt it, use guardrails, etc. It's a valuable tool to learn and today more than ever you're likely going to need it for most jobs soon.\n\nI wish you the best.",

          "text": "First let me start by saying do not neglect your health. I’ve been laid off before and was the sole income provider at the time and it’s stressful as hell. It takes a toll on your physical health too. Crying is okay. Being upset is okay. Your wife should be supporting you through this and I’m hoping she is. I don’t want to get too into the personal stuff but I’ll leave it at that. \n\nYour skills. That you’re just building the same react app suggests that you might be a frontender who got in through the design layer of web development (pure html, css, with some light js) and might be lacking CS skills or background. Maybe you’re not familiar with backend concepts? You can be a very successful front end engineer but most of them have a good understanding of backend concepts and operate at the “back of the frontend”. Google “the great frontend divide” and you’ll find some good things there. The days of frontend and backend devs slinging code over the wall to each other is over in many Saas companies. \n\nThat could be why the interviewer said you weren’t senior. It’s not just about learning a framework or library. I don’t say this to discourage you but so you don’t use React (or Vue or PizzaKebab.js) as a lifeboat. That way leads to more layoffs. \n\nIf you’re floundering at the coding interview, consider investing in one of those courses that teach you how to pass leetcode and live frontend coding interviews. They walk through the solutions in videos and teach you about the various complexities that interviewers check for. You don’t need to become an expert in backend or algorithms but you just need to understand enough to perform for the interview. I don’t recommend just banging your head against leetcode sites alone if you aren’t able to learn it on your own without guidance. With the stress you’re under, it’s normal. \n\nMost companies just run through the same exercises honestly. Make this loop efficient. Do something cute with a string. You’ll see patterns emerge and will be able to pick them up. \n\nI’ve written a lot but hope it helps and things pick up for you.",

          "text": "Hi, I am so sorry to hear you going through this - the job market is tough out there and the added stress of providing for a young family is extremely tough. I can imagine how you feel, I work as a frontend software engineer myself and even tho I am currently employed, I try to stay interview ready which can be very overwhelming. \n\nThis is the interview process followed at my company when we are interviewing for developers. Please note: the level of knowledge expertise that's expected from a candidate depends on if they are applying for a junior, intermediate or senior level role. \n\n- coding portion (either pair programming but with most algorithmic questions to understand the problem solving ability of a candidate along with their knowledge or JavaScript/typescript). We also give candidates an option for take home assignment even though we know that candidates can ask AI to do the entire thing, during the interview it can be pretty easy to guess if the candidate knows their stuff. \n- theoretical questions portion: for FE engineering roles we expect candidates to be knowledgeable about our tech stack which is react, typescript, state management libraries like redux, CSS/styling questions, some basic CI/CD and security stuff like different between cookies vs. sessions. \n\nThis is my personal plan for staying interview ready (I say personal, because different things can work for different people plus I am also assuming that you are proficient in JavaScript/typescript) but I am going off what we are expecting from potential developer candidates at my company: \n\n1. Practice leetcode questions (you can start from the easy ones and work your way up, I think for me - doing leetcode questions is more about exercising the problem solving muscles of my brain).. also note: I think because of AI - hiring managers know that working code can be generated very quickly so now it's more about the developer having the knowledge and intuition if the AI generated code is good enough/has the correct structure and fits the codebase.. so in an interview  that's what they could be trying to gauge. \n2. Depending on the tech stack of the positions you are applying for - create a small working applications which you can showcase during an interview and also add to your GitHub.. basically building a portfolio that you can add to your resume. For example, if you are applying for react focused roles - then you can perhaps build an react application with MERN architecture. And if you want to apply for full stack roles - then you can add a backend with Python  to the same application? I tend to leverage the help of AI for learning these things but I make sure that I fully understand the code AI is producing.. to do this I look at the actual documentation, still leverage stackoverflow/forums etc. \n3. Get good at answering technical questions and at technical discussions about the stack so you can practice that: for example, practice some theoretical questions about the framework, JavaScript, typescript, CI/CD, security, styling, data structures, system design and architecture etc. \n4. Highly recommended: networking. I think in this job market, it's unfortunately easiest to get a job if you get it through connections (former coworkers, folks you know on LinkedIn, meetups, networking events etc). \n\nI hope this helps and you land something soon - good luck!!",

Regular exercise and hobbies (especially social ones) are a must. Working is stressful and mentally taxing in one way, but unemployment is wildly demeaning and soul crushing. You need to keep your mental strong or everything else will collapse. If that means one or two less hours applying to jobs then so be it (and to be honest that many hours a day doesn’t seem too productive)\n\n2. Grinding the same React app over and over again doesn’t seem like a very productive way to prepare. Leetcode, systems architecture tutorials on YouTube, books, etc are your best friend. Use Glassdoor to try and find out what the questions or potential interview material will be. Get real good at bullshitting questions (which is a valuable skill in the industry regardless). These interviews are pretty bad at assessing your actual ability as a programmer most of the time so I wouldn’t be too concerned with improving as a programmer and more concerned with learning to cheese interviews.\n\n3. I would consider diversifying the types of roles you are applying to as much as possible. I spent the first couple years of my career in consulting and that opened my eyes to a wide variety of roles that are outside of the typical “engineer” or “developer” stuff most people apply to. Consultant roles are a good place to start, sometimes companies title roles as “solutions architect” etc. IMO I think for better or worse the industry is changing as AI tooling improves and management expectations will morph around that. The sooner you can market yourself as a problem-solver or people manager or whatever (besides just a guy who writes good code) the better off you’ll be long term.\n\nAlso, make sure you’re passing the vibe check… I understand things are wildly stressful for you right now but don’t let that leak into your interviews. It’s just as important to come off as someone who is easy to work with as it is to come off as competent. I’ve interviewed a good amount of people and it’s soooo much easier to advocate for someone who has a good energy about them.",

My family struggled financially growing up, and I have looked at my baby and started crying, thinking about how I just want to provide a better life for her.\n\nI have a few more years of exp than you and FAANG experience, so my interview process is plodding along right now.\n\n**Let me you give you the sauce:**\n\nYou NEED to sign up for either Great Frontend ([https://www.greatfrontend.com/](https://www.greatfrontend.com/)) or coderpad ([https://coderpad.io/](https://coderpad.io/)) and do 3-4 of these challenges per day. If you don't have to take care of your kids all day, and have long stretches of hours, honestly I think you're golden. You have nothing to worry about: only the grind is ahead of you. Budget for a month and after 30 days you should be in a MUCH sharper posture for interviewing.\n\nIn between doing these exercises, read the react documentation, watch videos doing deep dives on react and frontend SWE (there are plenty on youtube), and also on weekends make small apps like the TODO you mentioned.\n\nHave the discipline to do this, and I'm willing to wager you'll pass a Senior Frontend technical within 30-60 days of consistent practice.\n\nYou already have the foundation, you were just in a job that didn't push you to your limits often. The good news is you can crunch that. Frontend SWE isn't *that* hard, and can be learned quickly.\n\nFor your stories/behaviorals/STAR questions, you might have to fudge the truth a little bit here. Make your work sound meatier and more difficult than it was. It is what it is.\n\nIn terms of backend: be honest about your limited experience here, but you can always study hellointerview system design and study REST and make small CRUD apps. A small CRUD app that can be made in a weekend, combined with studying, would teach you most of the fundamentals you need to know to be considered a \"full stack\" engineer. The advanced system design requires more effort and time, but all the resources are on hello interview and youtube.\n\nGood luck man. You're not alone, this industry is topsy-turvy right now.",

Tailor your resume to that. And spend time studying and researching so that you can answer 100% of the questions in your expertise. HackerRank and Leetcode problems suck, but companies use them, so practice until you also have that tool in your arsenal. Do some googling of interview questions for front end engineers and questions for all of the technologies you use. Make sure you can answer all of them well. \n\nFor me, most anxiety comes from either uncertainty or lack of ability.

That interviewer who told you so bluntly was insensitive, but unfortunately they were not wrong...\n\nI'm not trying to hurt you - I'm trying to tell you the truth. You may have been given a senior title at your last job, but you need to understand that titles are not in any way consistent between companies and/or industries.\n\n> My work there was mostly incremental. Small features on existing web apps, CMS updates, and occasional larger projects building 0 to 1 frontend web apps in React. Whatever the business needed from a frontend perspective.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry OP, but this is in no way senior-level work at any software product company or even agency in 2026. The needs of the company you worked for were fairly rudimentary, and so that's where your skill level is at. Further, you ended up specializing pretty narrowly, and if you're going to specialize, the expectation from companies is going to be a higher level of mastery in that specialization which you don't seem to have. So your skills lack both breadth and depth - neither of which meet the bar for a senior role.\n\nIf you're going to land a job, you really need to move past your self-pity and sob story about your family. I understand it's real for you, but it's irrelevant when it comes to your job search. You spent most of the content in your original post seeking validation that it's the companies that are the problem instead of accepting any accountability.\n\nIf you're actually going to do right by your family, wallowing in self-pity definitely isn't going to get you there. You need to accept the fact that you're starting from basically scratch. Swallow your pride and start applying for more junior or mid level roles. The goal at the moment is to get a job.\n\nAgain, please accept this feedback in the good faith nature that it's intended in. I'm trying to help, not hurt.",

          "text": "Okay, first off: this isn't just you.  The current state of the employment market is not reflective of you as a person or you as a skilled worker.  It's fucking hard out there, and I speak as someone with fifteen years' experience who's just spent four months out of work looking for a contract gig.  It's not just *literally* cold out there.  I suspect it's because the whole AI thing has had companies second-guessing whether they *need* to hire people or not.  It seems to be thawing a little since late November, but nowhere near where it was.\n\nSecond: tech tests suck.  I don't know anyone who likes them, and to be honest with you most places that have competent leadership realize that they're not representative.  The best gigs I've had have been for people who know within forty minutes of casual conversation whether you know your stuff or not.  But they're designed so that nobody should get 100% on them; it's not a pass/fail thing - but if one of the candidates *does* know linux command line and how to set up an AWS infrastructure then they absolutely want to know that and judge appropriately.\n\nWhat I will say is that a lot of companies can be absolute pieces of eight about it.  In the past I've been negged about my abilities just so I'd consider a lower paid job.  I've been told I shouldn't be applying for a senior position.  (For context, I didn't just declare myself to be senior; an employer spontaneously told me that's what I should be calling myself given my skillset).  Some people - not all techies or even a majority, but the field does seem to attract them - just enjoy dicking on other people to elevate their own self esteem.\n\nWhat I suggest, in the current atmosphere, isn't training, or coding exercises, or qualifications; there will always be a field that they want that you chose not to learn in favour of something else, they'll always have a tech test from a different website.  Just do what interests you, what takes your fancy - because that will help keep your head up, and what you want is a job in a field you're interested in, right?  And adjust your attitude instead.\n\nYou're a goddamned experienced developer with nearly a decade under your belt in a field where they're asking for minimum three years to call yourself \"senior\".  That's not just coding knowledge, that's industry knowledge and experience of how to get shit done.  These incompetent snots are throwing pointless tests underfoot.  That's not something to feel defensive about, that's something to get angry about because a competent recruiter would be asking you, to your face, \"In Vue, do you prefer the options API or the composition API?\" so you can wax lyrical about the advantages of readability and explicit vs implicit behaviour definition.  Or whatever.  (Do not focus learning Vue, in my experience there's more React about, you're on the right track there).\n\nAlso, one tip that I'm going to PM you because if I post it here it might spoil it.",

In this hypothetical scenario you probably would sound relatively casual or more confident whereas in the current mental state you probably sound less confident and for lack of a better word, more desperate. I think not many people would like to hear that tone in a formal setting.\n\nBased on the above hypothesis/theory, I’d suggest the following \n1. Resume going to gym, it’ll help you with your confidence in general.\n2. Consider meditating few minutes a day, as little as 10, it will help you with your anxiety in your day to day life.\n\n\nAfter being a senior at my first company, it took me a lot of time to find another role as a mid level engineer.

      "text": "Little over a year ago I interviewed for a generic SE position (hiring for multiple levels of experience) with a large, international tech company that had been on my radar for years. The interviews went well, and at offer I was surprised to see TC would roughly match what I was currently on (competitive, but not by big tech standards). Some of that would be RSUs, which vest front-heavy, so my TC risks becoming less competitive year-on-year.\n\nAt the time I tried negotiating and they pushed back. At the time, I was keen to leave my current gig so thought; “hey, this one is for the long haul, and I’m sure once I’m in it’ll all work out”. I was informed that my level could be reviewed after my 6 months probation. It’s important to note that, at this stage, I have no understanding of their internal levelling system. There’s no “juniors”, “mids” and “seniors”; it’s all just I-level “engineer”.\n\nFast forward 4 months, manager says he’s putting me forward for a level-bump. “Fantastic”, I thought, “everything is balancing out”. 6 months comes and goes and there’s no real reasoning why my level hasn’t been bumped, but I remained the level I was hired in as. I’m told “you’re doing everything right, and at the annual review cycle, you’ll be put forward”. I push the point, and for feedback, but ultimately leave it - I don’t want to rock this nice boat I’m in.\n\n10 months approaches, my responsibilities have grown significantly, as more people from my team leave and our domain grows - we also hire a new set of juniors which need onboarding, and our department is now world-wide, meaning more anti-social working hours. I push the point of promotion with my manager again, to be told that everything should be fine, but company policy is that someone at my role needs to be in the position for 1.5 years before being eligible for promotion. I say “this should be an exception”. He makes no guarantees. I feel this drifting away, and wonder what I can do.\n\nI make 2 applications total, with the idea that I’ll use them as leverage against my current position. “That’s how people do it, right?” I think to myself. One of the 2 positions is a long-shot; a staff-level position in a mid-size company. 4 rounds of interview later, they’re offering me a position at a 20% TC increase vs my current role, with promises of a better WLB. I weigh my options.\n\nAt the same time, I’m discovering more about the internal levelling system. I ask HR for some guidance, and they forward me to a page which outlines the I-levels used. I find that I’ve been hired at a level usually associated with someone who is 1-2 years into their career. It’s one level above “entry level”. Naturally salty, I hand my notice in the same week.\n\nThis year has moved fast; I’m still reflecting on this decision. I’ve no doubt that staying at the big tech company would have yielded good results, but I’m optimistic about the opportunity I’ll have in the second company. On a personal level, I feel jaded over my brief experience at this company. It’s the one point in my career where I’ve felt adversarial to my employer; as if I needed to actually fight for what was owed. I never really got an explanation for what happened; perhaps it’s either it’s genuinely some clerical error, or some of my previous experience was treated as insignificant.\n\nAnyways, that’s the story. There’s some life-lessons here about fully understanding the offers that are being made, and researching companies like this for internal levelling systems \\_before\\_ accepting the offer. I won’t forget that in a hurry. Has anyone had similar or contrasting experiences? Or has anyone with better insight into these processes got any theories as to how this happened?",

          "text": "Big companies move slowly with promotions, since the process of promotions is coupled to reviews and needs to be standardized across organizations. It's a \"political\" process if there ever was one: each org gets some many promotions, everyone wants more, and the company has to regulate the means in which people are paid more money to avoid blatant unfairness. Every manager wants to promote more, it's a win for them, but at scale that decision rests several levels above them.\n\nThat said, the higher up the SWE ladder you go, the smaller the promotion aperture. I'm trying to get a staff promotion, or be on the \"staff\" promo track as a senior in big tech, and it's daunting. There's a huge compression right now into \"Senior Engineer\", partly due to hiring practices (down-levels), partly due to what my company considers \"staff\", and partly due to the current job market conditions. The single best thing you can do is understand the the expectations per level, and calibrate your work to that, and accept that the system moves at a pace that reflects global scale, not local optima.\n\nIn terms of your situation: seems like a win to me? You took a job for a salary you liked, you were ambitious and operated above your level, but the promotion schedule didn't fit your needs. Not bad considering your leverage was rewarded with a better job. Preserving your trajectory despite any single company is a major win in my book.\n\nDon't feel bitter about the situation: your manager has every incentive to make sure you stay, and the company is trying to enforce a globally consistent and fair promotions using a cyclical process. IMO, the real understanding, is knowing the system operates like this because the alternatives at scale are so much worse (imagine a race to promote people, or promos themselves all going to one org), and your discomfort doesn't invalidate the company or the work you've done. Contradictions abound.",

I wonder if Im lying to myself that the grass might be greener at a different place, and that compensation correlates to stress + work demand. \n\n\nI think for myself, a decent amount of my ego and identity is tied to being at a \"high paying, important job\" and going to a less demanding place would bring a different type of stress where I feel like Im doing less than I could. It's hard to imagine there being a place that is intellectually stimulating (e.g. not crud apps), low stress but engaging (e.g. coworkers arent coasting), and satisfies the ego.",

I was paid 110K  with 15 YOE to lead teams of 20 SWEs on multi-year projects.  Most people would call me way underpaid, but I couldn't get a better job so I just had to deal with being the \"best\" in a sea of mediocre SWEs.  This didn't mean I was an actual good SWE.\n\nAnyways, a large complaint I would read on sites like Glassdoor was how stressful the company was with constant deadlines.  I see where people were coming from, but I never felt any of this pressure as a SWE or a Lead. This was because I realized a while ago that management literally didn't care about their deadlines.\n\nDeadlines were just a vehicle to set goals for the team.  It didn't really matter if you met them or not.  In fact a team I was on missed a major release by over 1 year and we still got a company party for receiving FDA approval to start a clinical study.\n\nSo I guess my point is if you are easily swayed by management speak then I could see people felt the stress of getting things done at this company.  But if you can just ignore the noise from management and just work normally then nothing really happens with missing a deadline.\n\nThough one of the side effects from my personal tactic is that it doesn't show management the team needs to grow when it does.  I've definitely heard things from management about how they didn't think certain teams were working hard enough so requests to grow the team with the intention of meeting those management deadlines were rejected.\n\nI guess management wanted to see the team burning the candle from both ends for an extended period of type type of work.  Then they would use expanding the team as some kind of reward for all that hard work to help meet future deadlines. It's was some backwards weird logic from my perspective.",

The performance they have to give will involve the same effort. One could argue it may be easier the higher paid you are, because people may realise it is expensive to waste your time. An A lister may have a body double to do the lower value work, an assistant to make sure all their needs are met, and a voice coach to help them improve their performance, while a nobody actor will be expected to do everything with very little support.  And it’s easier to give a good performance when working with people who are also giving a good performance. If everyone around you is incompetent, how much harder is your job?\n\nHowever if you work somewhere where nobody (not your manager or colleagues) can’t tell the difference between good and bad work, and you yourself don’t care about doing good work, then you might be able to get away with just doing bare minimum work. You would need to spend more time and effort convincing people you are actually working when you’re not. This would be a very dysfunctional place to work, a shit job, and you would have to cultivate a lack of care for it. \n\nTo find a less stressful job, it is not about going to a lower paying job. It is about identifying what makes you stressed, and taking the job that has less of that & more of what you like and enjoy. If you want more work life balance, take a job that provides that. If you want to work from home, get a remote job. Preferred workplace culture, type of work, industry vertical, etc. A framework like ikigai might help you identify what it is for you.\n\nOnce you know what your ideal job would look like, when you find something that fits the bill, it may or may not involve less money.",

It's not universal but, if there's a correlation between stress and compensation, I would not be surprised that it's *negative*.\n\nThe exception to this pattern are places that pay less for some other specific reason.

My default decision right now is using LLMs and lots and lots of googling, but LLMs seem to be poor at these higher level decisions and googling is the just the default solution. Obviously I think the correct decision for a start up like this is to hire a more experienced engineer at this critical time, but I definitely need a job and only just got this one after months of applying.",

Don't try to solve for everything all at once; figure out what you need for the next 1-3 months (6?) and build something that solves that problem.  Try to keep things modular and flexible so you can expand later but don't spend time building super flexibilility or abstractions that you may not need in the short term.\n\nIf you have an existing code-base that makes things more complicated.  It may be worthwhile to try and reuse some of it but it could very well also be a time-sink and compromise your long-term architecture.  Someone on my team suggests using an AI to answer questions and provide an overview of existing code but I absolutely would not let an AI write anything for you - not at your level of experience and the general fragility of AI-developed software.\n\nOh, and did I mention you should write down on paper your requirements, architecture, schema, major flows, etc.?

However for these the decisions it’s often aligned with the industry standard way of doing things. So make sure to do a lot of research and talk to people in industry to come to a good solution. Copy well known architecture in the wild (similar to the adage “no one got fired buying IBM”. (1 way door problems)\n\nA couple irreversible (highly contentious to change) decisions areas:\n\nCloud: AWS\nDNS: Route53, sometimes Cloudflare\nDomain Registrar: AWS \n\nDatabases: pick Postgres and jame everything into the database until it causes issues (years from now). Might be a hot take but at least it’ll be a business problem not a you made a bad decision problem. \n\nProgramming lang: industry dependent but in general Ruby on Rails, Python, Java will be good everywhere. \n\nWhen in doubt pick boring technology. DO NOT PICK SOMETHING EXCITING Kafka, or Mongdb\n\nOTHERS \n\nCI/CD: CircleCI, GitHub Actions. (Jenkins is a big NO. Buildkite meh)\n\nSecrets: AWS secrets manager. Maybe sops. Don’t use Vault as a solo maintainer. \n\n\nEnvironment variables IS BETTER than hardcoded urls in source code. This is where you’ll run into most of the business issues and your Devops backlog because the app was not built with flexibility in mind. Which means it make it much harder to run the app in isolation, ephemeral (mock service urls instead of fixed prod and staging)\n\nFINAL NOTE\n\ntraffic architecture: in general if you add a traffic routing shim just after the DNS layer and before the database layer (usually app EnvVars) you almost guarantee your architecture to be infinitely flexible because when you need to make changes (even big ones) you can just flip a switch to route traffic to a different location. \n\n instead of doing weird wacky stuff at the app layer and having to deploy a new version of the app in maintenance mode and then redeploying to go back. And it usually ensure you don’t have to mess with DNS and wait for the cache to bust. It’s instantaneous. \n\n\n—\nI’ve been the solo Devops person many times so I’m very familiar with your position. \n\nIt’s not hard to develop intuition if you just build a lot of little POCs and test the migration paths given different scenarios.

Your position requires a person that is capable of great deal of autonomy and that you can think strategically, make compromises and prioritize things by yourself.\n\nThose skills are not easy to learn quickly, but there is a bunch of advice that can help a lot.\n\nHere is how I think about your particular problem:\n\n1. You are responsible for delivering a certain capability to your company. Talk to your bosses what that capability is. Let's assume for now that it is providing platform and tools for their quickly growing application and development and ops team. And yes, it is \"ops team\" because even if you are a single person today, if they are actually growing quickly, that is going to be a team in a year.\n2. Anticipate future needs. If the organization is growing quickly, focusing on \\*current\\* stuff means you are already late to the party and you will be a bottleneck. You need to be constantly in touch with your bosses to define what is the expected state in 3, 6, 12 months from now so that you can properly prepare and prioritize work.\n3. Run gap analysis. I do this personally -> I try to imagine the state we have to be in 3, 6, 12 months and then I try to think about anything that we do not have now that we need to have in future. For each identified item I write down what it is needed for exactly and then try to figure out if I can fulfill that need in some alternative way. Talk to your bosses -> they might be completely fine spending some cash to get you unblocked, for example. I also define it as a project and then I try to define returns and investments needed to get the project done -> this is important because I probably can't get all projects done so I need to prioritize them based on RoI. I also need to be able to talk to my bosses and what CEO wants to hear from you is to the point explanation of why we need it and what it is going to cost us.\n4. Think strategically. You want all your projects to be lego bricks that fit together to achieve a desired goal.\n5. Try to get 80% of outcome with 20% of effort. Or maybe 70% with 10% of effort. You have less resources and time than you need to get everything done. Rather than getting only some things done, try to get everything moving at some reasonable pace so that there are no things that suddenly become huge blockers.\n6. Do not be afraid to use unconventional methods (but maybe discuss with management?) For example, when I got hired and suddenly needed to do a lot of infrastructure work I had little experience with, I just hired a bunch of guys on Fiverr to do the job faster and better than I would. I just made sure they are working under supervision (on Zoom calls in my case) and that I understand what has happened so that I can properly document and continue the work in future.",

When taking high level architectural decisions you can no longer dig into details or you will simply get lost in a rabbit hole and entangled. \n\nWhen making architecture choices (or rather recommendations, I have very limited agency ATM) I spend some time on the problem statement, then analysis and ideation what could possibly solve the problem, then I drill down a little to play with the ideas and create some kind of a mind model to evaluate some what-if scenarios, both optimistic but also, and especially, pessimistic. I do not dig into implementation details of specific components but rather their capabilities, e.g. if I design for multi tenancy I will be interested in capabilities and various ways of implementing it in a distributed system but without looking at how exactly the code / IaC would be written. That's tomorrow me's problem. Today's problem would be \"how would this model affect security / scalability\" or \"how easy or difficult would it be to onboard a new tenant\".\n\nWhat I end up with is some sort of a pros and cos list for each option, cost and risk matrix, e.g. I may recognize that some multi tenancy implementations could be risky from time pressure perspective while others would risk noisy neighbours problem, and such. \n\nNow that I have several options on the table, I would be looking at each of them as a list of trade-offs, eliminate options that have obvious deal breakers, and then try to order them from most to least aligned with priorities and/or most to least promising if there's no clear priority. That leads to a decision (if you have authority) or recommendations (if your role is only advisory).\n\nLast, but not least: I didn't mention earlier that it's also important to pay attention to how the system would evolve, how much upfront investment is needed to see first tangible results, and whether the architecture would be easy or hard to change or evolve into something else later. Some decisions may be very difficult to undo later, while others may leave a few options open, like building from simpler solutions that can be used as building blocks to create something more robust later, without turning the entire architecture upside down and a major overhaul. It's generally a flaw I see as a grunt in many, many architects in their ivory towers. From their perspective, a system is often a static entity that should reflect exactly their designs. If the system is incomplete or flawed then blaming happens. But a system is dynamic and ever evolving, and design docs are north stars at best and outright fantasy at worst. Remember that when designing.",

The problem is that, when you move from low level implementation and design to high level architecture decisions, the amount of criteria you need to consider for every decision is maybe one order of magnitude higher. You need to think about security, availability, integrity of data, identity/access management, auditing, scalability, maintenance, operations, team dynamics and tech affinity, domain specific criteria, backwards compatibility, testability etc. etc. the list goes on and on. You need specific experience with each of those topics, even if very generic and shallow, in order to make good architectural decisions. I think it's very important not to set expectations for yourself that you will be able to \"quickly\" learn how to make these decisions. A lot of it is just experience, which involves a lot of bad decisions.\n\nI would also add that architectural decisions are a shared responsibility, not something that the architect does in their ivory tower. But that's a different topic.\n\nSo I would say, just do your best and try to embrace the process.

You're really trying to avoid fucking yourself by getting into a situation where the old solution needs to be completely replaced and can't just be extended.\n - Step 4:  Once you have a solution or two you think would work, try to spec out what high level tasks, or work on your end, you would need to do to integrate it.\n\nFrom there you can flesh out different details you think might be important.

It absolutely baffles me how many times my coworkers completely disregard the god-like tooling at their hands.\n\nWe have a monolith setup that needs a few knobs and buttons to be turned and pressed to test things. \n\nMy coworkers, who range from 5-15yoe mostly dont use the debugger to test things (e.g why is this value -12? where is the source of this NPE? is this multithreaded solution working as expected?). \n\nThey will instead turn on massive amounts of logging, eyeball the code and try to sherlock their way through a codebase with 500k loc, 20 years of tech debt and more often than not frankly flail around. They don't seem to even know what a breakpoint is. We have licenses to professional IDEs that make this so, so easy.\n\nI sometimes cross work with them, and find that what took them a day took me 5 minutes of stepping through code.\n\nThey do the same thing with debugging networking. It's like they're afraid to learn how to use wireshark. Do you know how hard it is to debug networking issues with just logs?\n\nIs this a common occurence? I'm still new in my career. I studied non-computer engineering. Do people who get degrees in comp sci never learn where the debug button is?",

If long term progress/solutions at the expense of some immediate resolution is encouraged, it will lead to overall longer term efficiency.

              "text": "And that is: the time needed to make debugger \"just work\" without it being \"just bind it to the IDE\" (because that hasn't helped).\n\nSay the next, I am debugging a test that runs over a program that heavily uses DI, and it only fails when running on the cloud, it succeeds on my machine. I suspect that the problem is that it's loading a different module on the cloud that it does locally, and that it's causing certain effects to differ elsewhere. Say I have a way of creating a test that recreates the error, and am able to run it locally and on the cloud, and recreate the failure consistently.\n\nSo the answer here is simple: I run the test with debuggers on both environments. First I run it on the cloud to identify where the bug happens (if I already don't know) and record the pertinent state that lead to the bug. Then I run it locally and break at the point of the bug happening and see how the state differs, and identify what about the state changed that might have lead to the bug. Then I start crawling backwards. It's going to be a mess because there's a reflection gap that doesn't let me know which module is being ran where, but I identify potential modules that could be causing the problem locally, then set breakpoints and see on the cloud if they're the same module or something else is being called, then on the cloud I find out what modules are different from the local ones. Phew. Finally I can identify what modules to set breakpoints on, and go through them identifying which of the modules are creating the problematic state. Then it's a matter of debugging that module.\n\nAt this point I'd probably use also some code-archeology. I'd try to see if I can identify the commit where the bug starts to happen, and see what that commit did and try to connect it to my discovery above. This all would be a solid 4 hours of debugging if I don't get a lucky break.\n\nBut wait: how do I run a debugger on the cloud? If I can SSH into a container in there and run the test inside the container it's 'easy' just make sure that the container has access to `gdb`, hopefully there isn't any policy against putting such powerful software on the containers, I mean they have their own SSH host so who knows. But what if I work at a company that is a bit more reasonable and doesn't let me just SSH willy-nilly into most containers? I could do this on staging, but what if the error only happens in production? Ok I could attach my local GDB to the remote process, but this needs us to allow this to happen. Again there's some security concerns in allowing this.\n\nSo at this point the company needs to allow a debugger to run on their containers, and allow remote gdb attachment, and then they'd need a system to turn this on or off (since you don't want the ability on by default), and engineers need to know how to do this. All this on top of knowing how to use a debugger effectively.\n\nMeanwhile I already know how to run a process in the cloud, and how to recover logs from it. So it's a lot easier to just get it done.",

          "text": "A lot of it is cultural. Visual Basic had debugger as a first class citizen in the 90s. Early day C/C++ devs were used to GDB/WinDBG since the dawn of time. I think Pascal had some too in its IDE? (I didn't do much there). Java IDEs have had first class debuggers since the beginning. People who started their career there early on are used to using debuggers all the time.\n\nThen you have early 2000 stacks with the popularization of Rails (Ruby), Django (Python) and people doing system or embedded development in C/C++ that was hard to run locally. The debugging tools existed for this, but they were often not as powerful, and they definitely weren't slapped in your face. For the web, browser debuggers were very basic (IE6's was insanely hard to use, it integrated with Visual Studio too and it was buggy as hell). A lot of people who started in that era found that just doing console logging was faster and easier.\n\nSchools don't teach more advanced debugging features like how to inspect threads, how to use conditional breakpoints and watches, how to build custom debugging UIs (common in .NET or Java to inspect more complex data structures in the IDE), etc. Lots of people end up using IDEs like VS Code which work out of the box for simple projects, but require some setting up to work with non-standard environments, and its often not done.\n\nVery few people know how to use low level debuggers (GDB/WinDBG), especially with high level languages like Java or C#. If you know how to debug a memory dump from the command line you'll generally be seen like a wizard.\n\nSo you end up with a very divided community on what people are used to.\n\nI worked in developer platforms at several large tech companies, and we'd often survey our internal population on this, and it almost always landed at 50/50 between people who use debuggers vs not, and it almost always comes down to which development environment and programming languages they learnt on originally. The habit then follows them forever. There's almost no correlation with seniority (as in years of experience). At the senior level there isn't much correlation with career success, but when you get at the principal level, especially for full stack, backend or embedded/system developers, you will see correlation with how successful they are, because debugging insanely gnarly issues in production with console.log isn't happening.",

I hope to god this has changed, but every time I’ve tried to use the Python debugger, it wants to use stdin/stdout, and overriding the default is a PITA that requires writing a subclass to initialize it. Have you guys ever tried to debug a program where the debugger is not only stealing the program’s input and interpreting it as debug commands but also corrupting the output?!\n\nThen there’s the Ruby debugger, which also uses stdio, but is easier to override, but then the Ruby maintainers broke the debug API in some major way, so people were maintaining their own forks. I sent some patches to one of the more popular forks, and the new maintainer was doing some ‘optimizations’ to the REPL by removing the ‘print’ and ‘pp’ commands because he deemed them redundant. Of course, in Ruby those functions return the string they output, so when you’re going around inspecting expressions the output is always doubled. Like hey, have you guys ever used a debugger before?!?\n\nI’ve worked at several companies where the source maps for the frontend were either missing or corrupted in some way, nobody knew how to fix it, most people didn’t know what source maps were. I spent a long night trying to fix them but the build system was so perversely convoluted that I couldn’t figure it out. \n\nNeedless to say, now I’m very careful about who I work for, what I work on, and how much time they spend maintaining the ‘developer experience’.\n\nWhenever people mention the 10x developer, I always just think oh, the people who always run their code from the debugger in case it crashes or they want to set a breakpoint, the people who step through their code the first time they run it to make sure it does exactly what they expect. The people who are getting an automatic read back in their IDE of the return value of every function from an unfamiliar API instead of adding a printf statement on every other line like a fricken’ caveman!",

      "text": "I'm reading John Ousterhout's *A Philosophy of Software Design* and Chapter 3's discussion of the \"tactical tornado\" led me to think about how we use LLMs and agents in our profession. The relevant section of the book goes as follows:\n\n>Most programmers approach software development with a mindset I call tactical programming. In the tactical approach, your main focus is to get something working, such as a new feature or a bug fix. At first glance this seems totally reasonable: what could be more important than writing code that works? However, tactical programming makes it nearly impossible to produce a good system design.\n\n>The problem with tactical programming is that it is short-sighted. If you’re programming tactically, you’re trying to finish a task as quickly as possible. \\[...\\]\n\n>Almost every software development organization has at least one developer who takes tactical programming to the extreme: a *tactical tornado*. The tactical tornado is a prolific programmer who pumps out code far faster than others but works in a totally tactical fashion. When it comes to implementing a quick feature, nobody gets it done faster than the tactical tornado. In some organizations, management treats tactical tornadoes as heroes. However, tactical tornadoes leave behind a wake of destruction. They are rarely considered heroes by the engineers who must work with their code in the future. Typically, other engineers must clean up the messes left behind by the tactical tornado, which makes it appear that those engineers (who are the real heroes) are making slower progress than the tactical tornado.\n\nI do not work at a company that has widely adopted the usage of agents (a handful of people in my department have access to Devin), but I have noticed most pro-agent discourse revolves around how you can improve the speed of development and ship faster. From the passage I quoted, it seems like speed of development is not considered a universal good by all and focusing on it can have drawbacks.\n\nSince I do not have the experience to comment on this, my question for those who have heavily adopted the usage of agents themselves (or work on teams where many others have) is have you seen any of these negative outcomes whatsoever? Have you experienced any increase in system complexity that may have been easier to avoid had you iterated more slowly?\n\nOusterhout's alternative to tactical programming is strategic programming:\n\n>The first step towards becoming a good software designer is to realize that **working code isn’t enough**. It’s not acceptable to introduce unnecessary complexities in order to finish your current task faster. The most important thing is the long-term structure of the system. Most of the code in any system is written by extending the existing code base, so your most important job as a developer is to facilitate those future extensions. Thus, you should not think of “working code” as your primary goal, though of course your code must work. Your primary goal must be to produce a great design, which also happens to work. This is *strategic programming*.\n\nWhen I see the power users discuss how they operate with several different instances of Claude working concurrently, I can't help but think that it would be nearly impossible to work with a \"strategic\" mindset at that level. So again, a question for those who have adopted this practice, do you attempt to stay strategic when basically automating the code-writing? As an example of what I'm asking, if you feed an agent a user story to implement, do you also try to ensure the generated code will easily facilitate future extensions to what you are working on apart from the user story itself? If so, what does that process look like for you?",

Maybe the answer there is really in solidifying that process, defining human in the loop checkpoints, and getting an entire team on board with that.

          "text": "> but I have noticed most pro-agent discourse revolves around how you can improve the speed of development and ship faster. From the passage I quoted, it seems like speed of development is not considered a universal good by all and focusing on it can have drawbacks.\n\nSpeed of development is a contingent good, not universal good. Shipping fast can mean your company survives another day (common in early stage startups - taking on technical debt is an investment in speed and survival and is ideally done judiciously), or it means you can spend more time on architecture, or on user research, or whatever else. It can be good, but it can also be bad when optimizing only for shipping speed over correctness, readability (for an LLM or a human developer), and maintainability.\n\n> my question for those who have heavily adopted the usage of agents themselves (or work on teams where many others have) is have you seen any of these negative outcomes whatsoever? Have you experienced any increase in system complexity that may have been easier to avoid had you iterated more slowly?\n\nNo, not really. It's not speed that affects that, but quality of the developer. If you're going to use these tools, you should be really good at detecting code smells, redirecting agents, and setting up guardrails to prevent the complexity in the future. The same thing you do when reading a teammate's code. You can also set up deterministic automatic tests, like a cyclometric complexity calculator, something I've used with human-only and augmented teams. They can be annoying but are very helpful.\n\n> When I see the power users discuss how they operate with several different instances of Claude working concurrently, I can't help but think that it would be nearly impossible to work with a \"strategic\" mindset at that level.\n\nI don't think it necessarily is impossible. I run a few projects with agents concurrently (necessary evil in my business) and it doesn't somehow make me unable to make or foresee architectural decisions. It does allow me to fail faster, though, and issues that I miss can be found and fixed much quicker since feedback cycles are so much shorter.\n\n> So again, a question for those who have adopted this practice, do you attempt to stay strategic when basically automating the code-writing? As an example of what I'm asking, if you feed an agent a user story to implement, do you also try to ensure the generated code will easily facilitate future extensions to what you are working on apart from the user story itself? If so, what does that process look like for you?\n\nYou should always be 'strategic.' That's the case whether you are not using an agent at all, using one just for rubber ducking or writing, or doing a full explore-plan-write-test loop, it just looks a bit different depending on what you're building, why you're building it (a simple planned out user story will look much different from a full feature or new project scaffolding), and it takes discernment and experience to do it effectively. Adding to that difficulty, we don't have established best practices yet, **everyone** is learning how to use these things while they change very rapidly, so there will be growing pains.",

If speed is the only success metric, they absolutely become tactical tornadoes that just move faster and leave a larger blast radius. We have seen teams ship more code with less shared understanding of why the system looks the way it does, which is a strategic failure, not a model failure.\n\nWhere this works is when agents are constrained to operate inside an explicit design frame. The human still owns architecture, interfaces, and long term tradeoffs, and the agent is used to execute within those boundaries. If you hand an agent a user story without guardrails, it will optimize for completion, not future extension. At scale, that is dangerous because complexity accrues quietly.\n\nThe practical shift is treating agents like very fast junior engineers. They are productive, but they do not get to decide what good design means. Strategic programming does not disappear, it becomes more important because the cost of tactical mistakes drops to near zero and the cleanup cost does not.",

You don't even need to run multiple instances of claude. You can use other models.\n\nBut the main premise and real world example is a GUARDIAN .md agent that runs a seperate process. One that has all the context of your coding conventions, example code, style guide, security guardrails.  \nTo reduce hallucinations, it executes a parallel process using your OWN tools. Your own linter, your own security scanner,etc. This runs in parallel to the main agent that you are throwing prompts to. But, it runs in the background of the 1st's agent's generated output. It is monitoring that output and flagging the first agent to stop with flags. When the 1st agent is flagged, with the stop command and stop exceptions, you can have a 3rd or 4th agent to verify those findings and reconcile the changes.\n\nIt is basically having an external auditor with a different opinion based on a different set of context.  \nI have different agents reading based on different AGENTs MD files like SECURITY\\_PROTOCOL . md, STYLE\\_CONVENTION . md, BOOTSTRAP . md , etc.. This keeps context windows small for each agent without overwhelming individual ones.  \n\n\nA real example is I do a lot of ES6 code. If the main agent deviates, it stops. My style guide enforces patterns like modules and seperation of domain of code. So my code is very DRY and readable. Without the secondary agents, CLAUDE would make 4,000 line files. With my agent, it makes 30 files all with proper imports/exports with a max of 60 lines. That is just an example. But it makes the code easy to read and easier to do digestable PR commits/reviews.\n\nMulti-agents is a MUST. Without it, it is a show stopper because LLM will use deprecated code libraries/dependencies/npm. Or they use the open source version when we have enterprise versions of packages with different featuresets. Hallucination is really not an issue when you have different models executing external tools versus letting one agent auto-pilot with no guard rails.\n\nSo when people say they do multi-agents, you have to examine their setup and tooling.",

Keep in mind I started with user stories, fed them to an LLM to create a requirements and used that to break it into epics and tasks, then massaged them carefully based on my experience to keep them at the correct step-size and to log, test, document each stage appropriately. I mixed in manual testing as the LLMs were churning. I architected the process where the agent operated in \\~5 min intervals, followed by me asking it to prove and validate the completion of each objective. \n\nIt took me a few days to complete a standalone web app project to the point I was confident to demo it. \n\nIs it maintainable? Yes. As a part of my process I had the agent write documentation for the features. For any feature there is a documentation that explains it, if I want to make changes I point the agent to the documentation and based on it I ask it to make changes. I dont intend to manually read thousands of lines of code and documentation so I needed to make sure the agent is able to maintain it.\n\nIs is debuggable? Yes. As a part of my process it was critical to design logging very carefully - too little and your agent will be lost, too much and your context window blows up and you go nowhere. \n\nCould I get it done with the agent working unsupervised - absolutely not, it would have collapsed really quickly - it took a lot of detours and messed things up many times where I had to stop it, roll back changes.

The team that had better defined technical leaders contributors did better to steer the platforms into a clear technical direction.\n\nIf you have a single or small number of codebases, having strict conventions, in terms of code organization, patterns, technology, etc, can be SO beneficial. It makes it easier for people to switch teams and projects and get up to speed quickly if things look familiar everywhere. Otherwise, people get holed up in their teams and parts of the codebase.\n\nYou really need to push your team to document everything and get in that habit. At ~15 people you know everyone by name, know who knows what, it is easy to talk about things, you don't really need to document every weird thing. At 50 people that doesn't work anymore, there's too many people. But people aren't used to needing to document stuff so during the fast growth phases newcomers really feel the weight of the implicit unwritten knowledge.\n\nStandards of quality need to be set in stone, whatever they are. The people who owned and grew the codebases at ~15 will become a minority and the codebases will grow out of their hands. Without clear guidelines of how things should be made, the codebases will grow in disparate directions and your older staff will burn out.\n\nIf you manage to build teams that work well together and bond, keeping them together is a great investment. It is tempting to split teams up in all directions because of whatever company wide strategy at the moment but in my experience, teams that have gotten used to working with each other can perform really well if given the right env.",

It may make sense for life-threating software development like health technology or aviation, or finance, but for most SaaS that check will hurt more than it will help\n\nBUT I do agree that a central \"tools\" / CICD team is so important - not just for making dev tools and processes that increase development speed - but also for establishing consistent practices across the engineering org. \n\nEven if they aren't approving every PR, they are creating consistent CI/CD process requiring tests to pass, or linting, that  can enforce that every team has the same quality checks out-of-the-box.\n\nSo many companies that I worked for where there are 12 different languages across different teams all building REST APIs. Different database types - some using grpc, some protobuf, various different auth methodologies, some with versioned apis some without.  And that variance slows down development extensively as engineering scales up.  (Also infrastructure costs explode because noone is cleaning up after themselves during the hyper growth period).\n\nInstead imagine a terraform template anyone can use to spin up infra with the correct tags for costing, or a Spring Boot (or whatever your language of choice framework is) customized template that people can use to ensure all REST API services are doing things the same way, and a organization github repo with templated github actions that run the same checks and deployments on every project etc, etc.",

There is something called communication distance, it measures how \"far people are away from each other by language, work times, same building, beliefs, hobbies, political view etc.\"  \n  \nIf the communication distance is very high, lets say you have a completely international team where no one speaks english as their native language and is in their home office, everyone has different hobbies, differnent views etc. They will not talk to each other if they don't need. This is normaly a ticking time bomb in software projects.  \n  \nThere are other things too like team size, TRUST and enablement. The most things are done normally by the team (because the team normally knows best how they work most effective). The big job of a leader is to make safe, trustful working environment (and I'm not meaning the FORD Modell here, this have driven so many companies into trouble). \n\nWhen we talk about governance, if you work in a very big company.

The developers and product people are expected to ensure their work.. works at least to spec.\n\nHowever, we operate VERY lean, 3 engineers total and can push to production (and regularly do) on the flip of a dime if we detect something broken.\n\nAdmittedly, a lot of stuff just get's tested ultimately by our users (internal employees  using the software to work with customers of our business).\n\nIf one of our users has an issue, they have a slack channel they can post to and one of us devs will always respond and investigate right away.  we're incentivized to test our shit and make sure it works because otherwise, we can get derailed during the day fixing issues.\n\nThis is also the most stressful job i've had but not because of lack of QA, it's really just trying to build and maintain such a huge product over almost a decade with like 2-3 people.  I am over here just the other day taking over email correspondence with a random insurance provider, so I can get all the information into our system in time for a 2 day deadline, that some other person in the company dropped the ball on.  This is the sort of shit that stress me out.  It still operates in like week 3 startup mode and realizing how incredibly fucking tech retarded people are, or unable to follow rules for providing data, ect. ect.\n\nThe no QA i don't really mind too much.  Every other team I've worked on besides this one did have dedicated QA.  It's nice and arguable neccesary for larger teams with a lot more different groups or people all having input on single features.\n\nHowever, devs that depend on QA to verify the code they write does what they intended.. I really dislike.  If a dev can't at least ensure it does what it's supposed to do on the good path that shit pisses me off to no end.  Nothing like pushing code or a feature that literally doesn't even work (sir did you EVEN run your code once before pushing??) will piss me off and I think more devs need to live in a world where they are responsible for their shit working more to build better habits and learn to TEST themselves too. \n\nQA gets more and more neccesary IMO the longer lived and bigger your product becomes, to keep up with regression testing and ensuring older features aren't breaking. (We use Unit tests as basically replacements for regression testing) Or when having bugs is a really big deal, like low turn around time for fixes or publicly facing products.  If some employee thinks poorly of me because I broke some shit fine but as long as we aren't losing customers over it, the employee can deal for a few hours until a fix is out.\n\nSo it depends I would say, on your product and how lean and responsive your team is to fixing issues as they come up.\n\nIt's boring work, doing a testing day but it can also be a chill day.  Once you guys are all ready, then you just schedule out the work for that day to be testing the product, everyone goes and verifies that whatever they are responsible for is working.  Plays around with other peoples work, raise any issues and push fixes, then retest.   As a dev you can usually just force or fabricate test data easily to quickly access certain features to test which is nice.  It's also good to know how your product works, makes developing or pushing back on features later easier.\n\nGod push back is so important, nothing is more frustrating than having someone who doesn't really understand the product try to pitch features or ideas.  That's a different rant tho.",

                  "text": "> Do you think QA is something that can be automated?\n\nYes and no.  I would say QA like anything else has a lot of things that can be automated, but you'll still need a QA 'person' to guide, maintain and extend that process.  So you wouldn't have the whole department automated but you can automate parts of it, maybe enough to rid the entire department and have different engineers take on piloting what is automated for testing.\n\nI think QA engineer role should be more common.  I can kinda understand people not wanting to do it, especially with the stigma around being labeled QA (at least there was where I came from, not sure about other industries) however, I think you can totally take QA seriously as an engineer position.\n\nFor some simple examples of automating QA, regression tests on products is an obvious one.  Lets say you have a webapp, there are libraries like Selenium that I think, are stated to be basically built just for this, but you can script interactions on the webpage.    You could write unit tests that go through the motions of the feature on the product and just verify that resulting elements exist.  Something like this could be fairly laborious to write however, it might also be a very easy case for an AI to write.  (I've never tried having AI write a unit test to use something like Selenium to perform actions and validate UI state but it seems like something AI tools could do)\n\nAs far as reducing time to write unit tests, the first thing that comes to mind for me would having the unit test framework maintained by the QA team.  As people write tests, if you have a team of people extending it or making the API easier to use could help reduce engineering time if they are the ones writing the unit tests.\n\nProducts can also get complex, sometimes you need data and assets, there aren't usually many prebuilt systems for asset validation (for example, ensuring all files referenced by a data file actually exist, no circular references in data).  QA could lead the effort on these.\n\nAll of those examples leverage engineering with QA though.  Most of these I've personally seen done anyways, in some form already and it's usually different engineering teams taking on that role.\n\nTraditional QA to me was usually more process driven.  They are maintainers of feature specs and have their own test cases and procedures they create to ensure product is 'ready' at different stages of development.  They also use these to ensure older features are still working, even after people who've built them are long gone.   \n\nFor this.. one automation idea I've had would be to use a mouse and keyboard input tracker and have people create basically little macros of their actions when using the product.  Then having away to run these on a QA machine that just replays all the actions and confirms the final result, maybe through a fuzzy screenshot matching system.

The Devs testing other devs code does a couple of things.  It allows familiarity/knowledge of something that was developed by somebody else.  It also forces the dev to think more about how the design and implementation works with testing in mind, because they are doing it to themselves and teammates, which generally makes better code.   Also it's far easier to higher software engineers than just QA engineers because the former is better career path generally for most people.  \n\nThe real problem is if you don't have anyone with QA knowledge around to guide the process and practices to setup things, and the other problem is without dedicated QA there is not incentive to create common tooling and helpers etc, so you need to rely on the open source community.

We had to test for interactions with other people’s known bugs. We could barely even automate most of it, because to do that, you’d have had to be able to automate control over desk phones, and there just weren’t feasible ways to do it at the time.\n\n\nFor the other side of it, it’s sometimes possible to put together thorough enough automated testing on backend services that you can run with full CD. It’s rare though, IME. Most of the time testing overemphasizes things that are easy to unit test, and underemphasizes things like “what if someone fucks up BGP?” Which bites even the biggest tech companies every once in a while.\n\n\nThe main observation I have is that someone should be asking: how much does it cost to have a QA failure? Because that risk needs to be measured and controlled, or someone (CTO) is not doing their job.\n\nIt is entirely possible that it’s not that big of a risk, depending on the business.

When you think it's bug free and ready for production, you ship it to QA and then they come up with a giant list of all the things you've missed :)\n\nQA not only brings a fresh look at things but it's also there to plan the testing, define test cases that are often missed by the developer and the rest of the team, perform regressions, etc.\n\nAs other comments already said, make sure you mention that velocity will go down because now you have 2 roles. And also before even beginning to go no-QA, make sure your pipeline, coverage and automated tests are solid if they aren't already. You'll need to assign time and effort to improve them for sure. Also set time in the Sprint for regressions.\n\nOn your side of things, and you should already be doing this anyway, double up the time for Unit Testing, documentation and automation, pipeline maintenance, etc.\n\nBut most importantly, at least for me, you can only go so far with full QA automation, some sort of manual QA is needed anyway so expect software quality to go down too. Make sure you have a solid process for shipping hotfixes too.\n\nWhere to go next on a personal level? \"Test\" (no pun intended) if you feel comfortable with this new way of working, if the context switching is or isn't too much, if the upper management adapts to the new slower velocity or not, if they're taking active steps to improve pipeline automation and handling tech debt correctly etc. And if you don't, you can always start looking for a new place to work :)",

And it worked! Developers started testing their own code a lot more. It just made developers wait that extra minute or two, give it that extra one last check before shipping.",

On my team's level:\n\n- He commits aggressively\n\n- He extracts heroics\n\n- He ships\n\n- Incidents are rare *enough*\n\n- When incidents happen, they are framed as unfortunate costs of speed, not leadership failure\n\nHe takes no accountability for committing the team to over-aggressive deadlines (seemingly not self-aware in this regard) and believes firmly that pressure reveals excellence, discomfort is the cost of impact, shipping under fire is leadership, and engineers who can't handle this are \"not there yet.\" Arguing with this ideology has resulted in lost political capital. The small wins I do garner for the team come at personal cost. His manager is aware of his.. quirks.. and I think is pretty eyes wide open to it all, but I think he's fine endorsing it as the insane pace of delivery keeps our stakeholders happy.\n\nThe few weeks leading up to major launches are your fairly standard death march, but heroics of a few engineers willing to succumb to his high-pressure tactics save us from any launch slippage or (usually, not always) major production incidents. \n\nHere's the problem:\n\n- company is great\n\n- coworkers are great\n\n- product is great\n\n- work is generally interesting\n\n- pay is pretty good\n\nIn lieu of all that I'd just hit the eject button but it seems like all of the cultural problems and pressure originate singularly from this manager (who increasingly makes it hard for me to get out of bed in the morning).\n\nI'm pretty sure internal transfer or leaving entirely are still the only options but would love to hear opinions/anecdotes on how others have/would handle this.",

I asked the right questions and it was sold as the team works under me as I have control of how things work.  The reality is I have control of the team, but not high level decisions that directly impact the team.\n\nPriority of tasks are handled above me,  Setting up good design practices is frequently side tracked because management doesn't think some of the tasks for a new feature are actually needed.  They had this great trick have saying lets schedule this work and would break things up in to phase 1 and phase 2 of the feature development.\n\nThe great thing for them was phase 2 was things like message retries that they didn't care about. So they just never made phase 2 priority over other feature work.  Of course when it actually becomes an issues it's a big to do, but they are fine dealing with it when it happens.\n\nJust like you experienced the level of incidents are acceptable.  The team may think they are operating inefficiently due to poor code quality, but the company sees sped as more than fine.  The reality is the system is working as designed by the people up top, as another posted stated.\n\nWhile we had aggressive deadlines there was literally 0 consequences to missing them.  We once had a major release late by close to a year and nobody said anything when it was finally done.  In fact the company still threw a team party for a successful release.\n\nThis may not apply to you, but what we eventually learned was to just stop caring.  Do what management wants in terms of priority. Push back against unreasonable deadlines, but relent after one time.  \n\nAt the end of the day nobody cares about deadlines as anything more than a carrot to trick weak people in to working overtime. Everybody realized this and never worked overtime.",

If you don't want to death march, don't death march, and don't order the people around you to do it. The only way these type of marches can work without burning people out is if you make everyone think it's there idea to do it, then the manager comes in at the end and shuts it down. Otherwise, it's brutal.\n\nThis is a specific, but avoidable pathology in tech. We're told to be autonomous, but only when that doesn't conflict with what the execs want to do. Ambiguity gets pushed on us all the time, and the cynical view is that happens to protect management and frame failure as personal, while giving the execs plausible deniability and a chance to criticize your decisions later.\n\nAll that said, if you are in a place where you can't focus on craft or leadership, and getting yanked around by games you don't want to play dominates your experience, it's time to move on. For the most part, software can be great, but that can only happen why you are happy with management, and given the freedom to explore problems, choose the solutions, and do engineering according to your abilities.

Leaving you with structured formatted files in your choice of a few formats. This creates a token efficient context file geared for use with AI on existing code bases. Even this alone was helpful for me to be able to grep and search across them as I was untangling what things were doing on my own with the structured data. \n\nIf you want to use AI, you would take those files from each, and based on your knowledge of related components, assuming there are a lot, group them, and one group at a time initially, feed those to an Agent with tool calling that has read-only file permission with a prompt to enrich the data further and let it stitch more data together. Since it will have the file names, line numbers and such it doesn’t need to read in every file in every project in the group, the Agent can use grep, and really increase your chances of keeping it aligned by preventing hallucinations you are familiar with when you hit the context window from token bloat.\n\nMethodically build out these enriched docs which have the token saving metadata and you’ll be able to have an agent build as close to end to end understanding of the whole show or at the very least be able to ask it questions and get relevant information. The key is to not let it treasure hunt for context, or have to make decisions for you, or ask about completely separate topics in the same chat, always think targeted context and targeted task. They really are quite effective when a good developer with knowledge of where models struggle, is at the helm avoiding those shortcomings.",

I’m looking for coaching tactics and boundary-setting that work when you’re a mentor/peer, not the TL.\n\nWhat scripts/expectations would you set? What would you do if the behavior doesn’t change, and how would you escalate gently without making it punitive?",

You just need to set expectations better. You don't need them to deliver a full solution right away, you just need them to put some of the initial effort into researching the problem. Identifying the key technical challenges even if they don't have a solution is valuable then you can help guide them from there on how they craft a solution.",

If you do that, you teach them to be less open about what they are thinking which is bad. I want people to be open and honest with me and therefore they need to feel free to tell me whatever they are thinking.\n\nIn the worst case, if you would dare to create disciplinary action for a person who is hesitant about tasks or says they don't understand, you will instantly change your engineering culture to nodding approval and saying yes to everything without any pushback or feedback. That's a straight path to a disaster.\n\nInstead what I do is I try to change their mind. What I frequently do is I ask them to simply show me. We jump together on the call and go about the problem. For example, I could ask them questions and drill down to what is exactly that they don't understand or hesitate about. Then maybe we go into the code and go through it in necessary amount of detail.\n\nWhile I do it, I try to assess what kind of problem am I facing. Is it just character trait? Or is the person actually underperforming and unable to figure it out? Not willing to put in the effort? Maybe this part of application is poorly designed? Missing documentation? Was this task not meant for a junior dev? Poorly specified? Why is the task difficult? Working closely on the issue is much better way to figure what is happening than trying to do this based on status calls.",

No solution required. The output is a rough approach, a list of unknowns, and specific questions.\n\nEarly on, I’ll do one or two of these together to model the process. After that, I expect them to run the first pass on their own. Uncertainty is fine, but engagement is required.\n\nIf the behavior doesn’t change, I address it directly as an expectation issue, not a personal one.

I said no, Frontend Guy would do it much faster. In my mind I was being responsible and continued to refuse it despite the manager saying it was fine \n\nFast forward some months, another guy joined. He had even less experience in compilers at all, but he was wicked smart, phd and all, and relatively experienced in hardware. Something similar happened when we're discussing tasks but he immediately accepted, paired up with multiple people, including me, and eventually delivered the work just fine \n\nIn no time, despite joining after me, despite having less experience in our field, he was promoted twice ahead of me. Was I mad? On the contrary, thinking back on his attitude it was clear to me why: he took the job. He took any job and saw it to completion with excellency \n\nHe has been my engineer role model for many years since then. I started emulating such behavior and without a doubt that was one the biggest contributors to become a good engineer\n\nIn summary, maybe your junior thinks they are helping by not taking on risks",

Why the heck am I trying to do reactive programming when I got threading?

Tell him something like:  \n“My goal with this is not for you to just complete the task, but to understand *why* it needs to be done this way, so you can become a better developer that I can rely on in the future.”\n\nThat gives him more motivation to actually want to learn, in addition to removing some of the real pressure around the task’s urgency.\n\n(Just to be clear, I’m not an “ExperiencedDev”. I have around 3–4 years of development experience, but most of my work was self-driven. I don’t really have someone guiding me, so there are many things I don’t fully know yet, I basically learn things as a project demands them.)\n\nNow, actually, a question: I’ve never really understood what a “pattern” is in the first place. I know I’ve implemented some before, because when I was an intern I had to keep the project structure similar to the rest of the team’s. But in practice, I was mostly “copying” the project structure rather than truly understanding what a pattern really is.\n\nI honestly have no idea what a pattern actually means. Is it the way the code is written? Is it the project’s folder structure? Is it how I should break down files to make them easier to read and understand?\n\nI know this is a question in the middle of everything, but for me it’s something I’ve seen other classmates ask in college, and to this day I’ve never had a concrete answer. Even after reading some books on the subject, I still can’t clearly say what it is. I don’t know if this is also a doubt your junior has, but if it is, being able to answer it might help improve communication with him.\n\n(I’m not sure if this comment breaks any rules, but if it does, I’ll delete it.)\n\n(I consider myself a “junior++”, since I’m the only developer at my company, developing its main software and dealing with everything from development to infrastructure.)",
