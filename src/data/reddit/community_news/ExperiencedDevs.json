His most recent take:\n\n“everyone's talking about their teams like they were at the peak of efficiency and bottlenecked by ability to produce code\n\nhere's what things actually look like\n\n\\- your org rarely has good ideas. ideas being expensive to implement was actually helping\n\n\\- majority of workers have no reason to be super motivated, they want to do their 9-5 and get back to their life\n\n\\- they're not using AI to be 10x more effective they're using it to churn out their tasks with less energy spend\n\n\\- the 2 people on your team that actually tried are now flattened by the slop code everyone is producing, they will quit soon\n\n\\- even when you produce work faster you're still bottlenecked by bureaucracy and the dozen other realities of shipping something real\n\n\\- your CFO is like what do you mean each engineer now costs $2000 extra per month in LLM bills”",

What made them so great early on were the constraints, and that is where innovation happened. \n\nA lot of companies given resource constraints really innovate and find themselves concentrated on the biggest bang for their time. When you can quickly build anything you want (abet poorly) you will find there is not enough push back to every question an idea. You end up flooding users with poorly built features and make it harder to do the one thing you were good at.\n\nI could be wrong. Netflix was making slop before AI, people loved doom scrolling social media, Uber’s interface is confusing and awful, and there is a reason why Amazon is filled with cheap items that barely work. Maybe in the end quantity really does matter.",

Back in the 90s and early 00s there were limitations to what you could do on both the technical and artistic side of video games due to the limitations of the hardware. This led to tremendous creativity and a focus on good art direction. This is how you get games like Silent Hill,  Halo, many of the great CRPGs and many many more.\n\nNow with almost no real limitations game design has not only stagnated in the AAA, but has also homogenized in both art direction and feature set. Limitations are the cornerstone of creative solutions. They keep scope under control, and allow the implementation of novel and actually exciting solutions.",

The guy who sent them suggested I could use a curl script to approve them but joked there could be an Easter egg. I told him I wasn’t going to do that and took 40 minutes to confirm every pr. One of them did in fact accidentally have a bunch of code unrelated to the expected change because his local branch was dirty. \n\nTo be clear I don’t blame this mistake on ai. He could have done it with a hand rolled bash script. I blame ai for the fact people don’t double check well enough anymore.",

Your product management group takes that final idea and figures out which dev teams have capacity and skill alignment, and work with your architects to determine constraints and platform options, and then the team's product owner and architect meet with the team. The team locks itself in a room for a half day and knife fights a plan out that will satisfy this refined requirement, and works with the product owner to create the story cards right there. The cards are refined right away, everyone is on the same page, and now that the work is mapped out, a real roadmap can be offered and work can begin.\n\nIt sounds like a lot. It kinda is a lot. But basically one business wants something and product owners and architecture solve constraints that are organization scoped, devs should design right from the start and be the ones making the actual tickets. \n\nBut that's me, and I enjoy my fantasy world. ",

I was a subject matter expert on a handful of internal systems, and I got that mastery by being embedded in these tools for a decade.

I find a tremendous amount of satisfaction describing a system to a new hire, junior, or experienced dev new to our stack and seeing the lightbulb turn on in their head and *get it*.

But say your NW is ~$3M and you make 500k$; after taxes, a bay area mortgage, and living expenses, you are maybe left with 150k to save. That is +5% of your NW, and that 5% is getting smaller each year as your NW increases. So you ask yourself, is this endless cycle of OKRs and performance reviews worth your time? The two options are: retire somewhere cheaper, or look for something bigger (either internally in the company, externally at a different company, or start your own thing).\n\nI chose the third option, as a 6-8 month trial.  Climbing the ladder internally at a large company was never pallatable to me.",

We work our hours and just leave because the company doesn't care about making things efficient, as much as they like money.

It’s reviewed, refined, and tested, but it is still reducing intimacy and familiarity with the repos.\n\nPeople are mostly camera off. A lot of people are ignoring the in office mandates. I’ve noticed more gaps in slack response times which leads me to belief people are off doing things during work hours (and to be clear, I’m fully fine with this. In an ideal world that is the what AI is supposed to enable).\n\nRegardless, the work is getting done, the stock is doing well, the company is in good shape financially. But the general mood and enthusiasm is just mildly resigned, at least on the Dev side.\n\nWondering if this is common.",

              "text": "Personally I'm working at about 50% of my actual ability these days.  Well...maybe 100% of what I think I can handle right now.\n\nI got burnt out during/after Covid.\n\nLaid off in Oct 2024.  Took some time to reflect, realized I was burnt out, decompressed, relaxed, thought about what I wanted to do next.  I had about 11 months off total but still felt like I stayed busy while also taking time to not work or think about work or anything like that.\n\nGot offered a job with a sibling team to the one I had worked with before being laid off and thought \"well it's a job and I know the area and I can provide value\".  It wasn't in the realm of \"what I had thought I wanted to do next\" but it was a job. Skip manager was someone I had worked with and felt they had the right outlook (slow but safe releases, use data to drive changes, etc.), and two of the people on the team I was joining were names I recognized and people I had worked with before.\n\nStarted Sept 2025.  Manager left the team Oct 2025.  Reported to skip manager immediately.  Talked with them about two possible people I knew who would be a great manager.  One wasn't senior enough, but the other interviewed for manager position Nov/Dec 2025 and was basically told they had the job but hiring was frozen.  As far as my work goes, was told I would have a semester (6 months) to work on improving my ownership area.  Ideally (and quite possibly), I thought we could 90% automate the area in that time.  Ownership was shared between me and one of the other people I had worked with before.  Total team size is 8 people, and on-call tasks are business hours only.\n\nEarly December 2025 everyone under my Director (M3) was reorged to another team.  Honestly probably makes sense in the long run for us to be in this org, but additional churn for the team.  This was part of the hiring freeze.\n\nJan 2025 my skip suddenly announced she was leaving (I suspect more of a \"there's no position for you here anymore, we will help you find something else\").  Bonus: the other two people I had worked with before were basically told the same thing.  My team of 8 now has 2 people finding new positions, and 6 people split between 2 other managers.  Myself (Senior), a SWE2, and a SWE1 are moved to one of these managers.  I take ownership of my area (which was also the main on-call focus of my old team) to the new team.\n\nNew team decides our back-up on-call person will handle what our old team's primary on-call handled (business hours only).  New team's primary on-call is 24-hours with a fair amount of tickets coming in each week, though we have 12 or 14 people or so now so it is less frequent.\n\nHowever.....now instead of 2 people working on my area, it's just me, and now the new manager wants us to automate it ASAP instead of over the next semester so there is less work for the back-up on-call person to do.\n\nSo....now I have to do the work of two people, as a single person, in less time, with more on-call work.  We lost the subject matter experts (I'm still ramping up / learning as much as I can, and I guess I'm the SME now), and the new team members don't always know how to do the back-up on-call work that was primary work for my previous team (even though we did a training session and recorded videos), so I'm essentially randomized with the same things every week.  My manager wants me to \"figure out how to solve that\" while also ramping up on the new team's on-call areas so when it's my turn to be primary I'll know what to do.\n\nToday I got pinged that one of my sprint story items was \"added to the list of accomplishments we're talking about tomorrow so make sure to finish it this sprint\" when I haven't even started it with all the other randomizations that have come up.  I think it will be doable before Friday but I guess I'm dropping the other stuff they said they wanted done by the end of the sprint.\n\nIt's frustrating because today when an incident came up and I got pulled into it (more of a \"is your ownership area the problem?\" kind of thing), I apparently was the only person who just dove into the code and started searching for the API name to see where the server code hosted and the client code called it to figure out how it all worked.  I was the only one to share my screen and say \"hey this is what I've uncovered\".... like more and more and see junior engineers (and honestly other senior engineer peers) unable or unwilling to just search and read code and understand?  So I know I'm providing value but also feel like due to the impossible deadlines that are being set, I won't be successful in this position.\n\nThis weekend was a long weekend and I was fine Sat and Sun, but on Mon I started to think about work and how I was going to accomplish everything with the recent org changes / layoffs, and I realized fuck it.  I'll put in my regular work day, and if it gets to a point where I'd rather leave than deal with it, I'll just leave.  Somehow I'm the SME of an area after ~5.5 months because of layoffs and still feel like I'm onboarding (I don't know what I don't know), so fuck them if they ask too much of me.",

Multiple times so far, I’ve been told modular code was tested, so I use it in my project. Code fails. Management is annoyed things are taking too long. The fix is something I can do without AI, but I just didn’t build that into my workflow because I was told it had already gone through QA.\n\nYesterday, there was a bug that one of the other devs tackled and when I asked for a postmortem, the write up had obviously been done in an LLM. It didn’t sound like him at all. \n\nMostly, I’m just disappointed, and that disappointment is affecting my care for the job. I’m essentially being told “we trust ai over you, unless ai gets it wrong, in which case it’s your fault and you’ll be expected to fix the issue in the time frame we expect ai to get it done.” I also feel like I can’t trust my developer colleagues’ work, because so far, their code has bitten me in the ass at least once a week. \n\nIt’s not fun ",

Frankly, is if somehow (and it's a less than likely chance) that we actually go into a slop era of the economy. Where low quality is the new high quality. Where shit can catastrophically break but that's just \"normal\" (I'm talking airplanes falling from the sky being normalized).

It doesn't make sense in most game development workflows right now.\n\nLooking through this thread, I see that the seasonal LLM FOMO is getting into too many people's heads once again. This hysteria got boring the last 4 times it spiked on Reddit. I have yet to see anything resembling a shift in this industry that isn't being unsustainably enforced by the more gullible types of managerial roles who have never solved software problems and think that they can reshape the hard and unscalable reality of development by screaming loud enough & firing enough people. A story as old as time.\n\nSpoiler, it hasn't and it won't. The pendulum will swing, the tech will reach an equillibrium, and agents will marginally supplement existing workflows in a minority of scenarios where they make sense, but most workflows will remain the same. There are too many matured, stable foundations in development workflows for something like this to come along and compete with the existing way software is created right now.\n\nI would hire a junior dev over artifically forcing agentic Claude Opus usage on my team any day of the week. We're ahead of competitors despite not shoehorning agents into our workflows, trying to force agents into our workflows would set us back in most cases.\n\nIt's not useless but it's also not an industry reshaping change. You all need to get real. When you've been in the game for a decade or longer, you begin to see through these engineering tool S-curve hype cycles which invariably fall a mile short of their promises, it gets boring.",

I have a few remote contractors helping me. My prior roles range from lead eng - to - director/EM.\n\nMy mood: fluctuating daily/weekly between fear and excitement. \n\nFears my career now has a short shelf life, or that we as devs will be relegated to glorified QA testers, or that a sufficiently knowledge PM needs no devs or designers at all, potential downward pressure on comp, and less jobs with more people fighting for them. Fears of being left behind because AI dev tools and practices are moving faster than I can keep up. Fears for society at large.\n\nExcitement because I can learn this new, interesting tool and try to optimize it. I’m excited about it unlike any coding thing I’ve learned in a while. It writes code better than my Vietnam contractors, and the designs are automatically better looking, and I can iterate with it very tightly. It feels so fresh and new. I’m excited about optimizing it and my workflow. And I believe there is an opportunity to individually capitalize on.\n\nAbout remote: I work on site 5 days its just me and the CEO in office. I worked remote Monday though because the office was closed. Admittedly I was watching movies or even playing Minecraft while letting Claude work for me and that was pretty nice (yeah I admit I was a bit lazy that day). It was a really novel experience. I goofed around but still actually got a lot done and made real progress on my project because of Claude. I think this checked out approach may be realistic in some types of jobs with lower expectations. Especially those behind the times. Thinking Midwest or not tech-first companies. But if you work in a high-paying job, or at early stage startup or in the Bay Area the expectations for productivity are going to 5-10x.",

I still very much do a lot of coding until I understand a repo enough to where I feel confident just reviewing the code, but I still have Claude do a bunch of stuff to make user stories go faster. \n\nAnyone who is strictly AI only yeah they tend to forget how the repo is structured and is harder to get them up to speed if there an emergency fix needed. \n\nWe are expanding and well funded in paper, but because of my past anytime I see expansion its more of a when they will start to downsize and am I safe or not. \n\nMood is even.

These people are basically offloading their work onto the reviewers. All they did was write a prompt in basic English and pass the generated code along. Then reviewers do the hard work of actually reviewing and fixing what they were supposed to write in the first place. After it’s merged, they still get to claim the full credit. Reviewers get nothing.\n\nTo put it simply, they’re just middlemen between Claude and the reviewers. So why not just assign the task to me, let me prompt Claude directly, and let me claim the credit instead?\n\nMaybe it's just my incompetent team. I'm curious: are others seeing the same thing?

Part of the process of using AI to code needs to be a human-in-the-loop reviewer. If devs are not doing their own thorough reviews for code generated by AI, they are just straight up not doing their jobs. It's like a worse version of copying and pasting directly from stackoverflow from loosely related problems.\n\n\nOP, depending on your role on the team, I would either create a policy or work with management and get buy in that you will auto reject code that is clearly just thrown over the wall/generated by AI. In the before-times, if there was an intern or someone junior who PRed something and clearly misunderstood or was way off down a rabbit hole or submitting broken code, you'd sit down with them and walk them through how to do it properly once or maybe twice.... If they continued to just not get it, they would not last on the team. \n\n\nWe should all be taking a similar approach, if a PR clearly hasn't been (thoroughly) human reviewed, reject it and talk to the dev directly about what they should be doing and why.... and if they continue to submit garbage code, handle it like it would have been handled previously. I haven't encountered laziness this extreme, but I'd start to escalate to upper management with references to wasted money on man hours and on the ai subscription, not to mention the massive risk of the company being a victim of, \"slopsquatting\".",

If you can merge in 5 PRs, 4 of which are cleaning/improving the original structure, you're probably better off quality wise than getting 1 PR up to perfection as you'll likely get to try the thing in some sort of staging environment and see what the \\*real\\* problems are, all the while you're simultaneously writing up the improvements to the original comments.\n\nWith business I've also made clear that we cannot guarantee a good level of quality & maintainability for much of the prototypes they're asking us to churn out. That's sorta OK as they get to try out a lot of ideas and we're free to completely restructure/rewrite the code later without worrying about producing the exact same results - which is usually quite a lot of work when you're having to refactor existing systems.",

Especially obvious issues, e.g. when the application would even start or it doesn't compile, should have really been caught by the dev, so they better have a good excuse ready.",

      "text": "Am I completely missing something?\n\nI use LLMs daily to some context. They’re generally helpful with generating CLI commands for tools I’m not familiar with, small SQL queries, or code snippets for languages I’m less familiar with. I’ve even found them to be pretty helpful with generating simpler one file scripts (pulling data from S3, decoding, doing some basic filtering, etc) that have been pretty helpful and maybe saved 2-3 hours of time for a single use case. Even when generating basic web front ends, it’s pretty decent for handling inputs, adding some basic functionality, and doing some output formatting. Basic stuff that maybe saves me a day for generating a really small and basic internal tool that won’t be further worked on.\n\nBut agentic work for anything complicated? Unless it’s an incredibly small and well focused prompt, I don’t see it working that well. Even then, it’s normally faster to just make the change myself.\n\nFor design documents it’s helpful with catching grammatical issues. Writing the document itself is pretty fast but the document itself makes no sense. Reading an LLM-heavy document is unbearable. They’re generally very sloppy very quickly and it’s so much less clear what the author actually wants. I’d rather read your poorly written design document that was written by hand than an LLM document. \n\nWhenever I go on Twitter/X or social media I see the complete opposite. Companies that aren’t writing any code themselves but instead with Claude/Codex. People that are PMs who just create tickets and PRs get submitted and merged almost immediately. Everyone says SWE will just be code reviewers and make architectural decisions in 1-3 years until LLMs get to the point where they are pseudo deterministic to the point where they are significantly more accurate than humans. Claude Code is supposedly written entirely with the Claude Code itself.\n\nEven in big tech I see some Senior SWEs say that they are 2-3x more productive with Claude Code or other agentic IDEs. I’ve seen Principal Engineers probably pushing 5-700k+ in compensation pushing for prompt driven development to be applied at wide scale or we’ll be left behind and outdated soon. That in the last few months, these LLMs have gotten so much better than in the past and are incredibly capable. That we can deliver 2-3x more if we fully embrace AI-native. Product managers or software managers expecting faster timelines too. Where is this productivity coming from?\n\nI truly don’t understand it. Is it completely fraud and a marketing scheme? One of the principal engineers gave a presentation on agentic development with the primary example being that they entirely developed their own to do list application with prompts exclusively.\n\nI get so much anxiety reading social media and AI reports. It seems like software engineers will be largely extinct in a few years. But then I try to work with these tools and can’t understand what everyone is saying.",

Any database product they had was relational! Just ask the salesperson; you know salespeople never lie. Dr. Codd, the creator of relational databases, was bothered by this, so he set up a set of 13 rules that a product had to match to be considered relational. The paper is referred to as “Codd’s Twelve Rules” or sometimes as “Codd’s Twelve Commandments”, despite the fact there were actually 13 of them because the numbering started with zero. In particular, Rule 12 was created to prevent some of this marketing hype.\n\nhttps://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/databases/theory-and-design/codds-twelve-rules/\n\nIs SQL useful?

Even with a test/CI/linter harness feedback loop, it only converges on something reasonable when I give it very detailed instructions.\n\nIt does do refactoring amazingly fast but I have to refactor sooo much *because* I'm using it.

But pretty equivalent-ish in that slice.\n\nAnd yea, you really have to stay on top of it. I haven't noticed many straight up logic bugs, but the real problematic ones are when there's any ambiguity around some instruction, it's still going to silently \"guess\" what you meant, and fuck up the business logic.\n\nI'd say with Opus, compared to Sonnet 4.1 (model I used before), it's gone from happening 80% of the time, to happening like 20% of the time, since it's just way better at deciding when to get more context and crunching it. It's still an issue, but a manageable enough one now.\n\nI'm really not sure how much of a time saver it is or isn't yet, tbh. There's been a lot of \"encouragement\" to, ya know, leverage AI and all that, so I really just decided to give it another earnest shot only in the last week or so, so I've definitely spent more time exploring and setting up (modern, detailed agent instructions, setting up mcps, etc) than building stuff, but I've done a few bug fixes, and a couple \"greenfield-ish\"/bolt-on type feature pieces as I've gone along, and it's pretty effective. \n\nI work on a lot of across the stack feature dev on a large consumer mobile app. I've been putting together a kind of monorepo that has our React Native repo, our application server repo, the repo with our gRPC client and host, and the repo with use to deploy our DB schema/profs. Basically everything you need to build a new feature in the app. I told it I wanted to work on setting up agent instructions, then spent a bunch of just explaining how everything works, what is responsible for what, and a process for how it should work (for example, it can't connect to our QA database, so I told it \"when we make changes to the Database project, write a copy of the new table/proc\" to a TODO/ folder, so I can copy it and run it myself\").\n\nAnyway, we have \"message inbox\" screen in the app that doesn't get a lot of love, so I picked up an old ticket where we want to add a way for users to delete and also undelete messages (archive, really). Not huge, but it requires a new button in the app, new settings option, small screen listing archived messages, a net new endpoint in the server, new args and logic in 2 others, protobuf updates, new proc, DB index ups, new table field...it was a lot of little stuff, across a lot of layers, and our codebase is not a particularly hygienic one....and this little terminal clanker bitch talked to itself for about 10 minutes, read some shit, wrote a bunch of stuff, and ended up with something that was not quite fully working, but only a couple tweaks away from it, and pretty much production quality code..overall, not too different how I would have written it. It followed the instructions I laid out, and after a couple back and forth (maybe 5 messages, over 30 minutes), it was up and running in QA.\n\nI feel like that particular one was pretty in its wheelhouse, since it was pretty simple to convey the full set of requirements, but it was impressive. I know the perception study, and I know I'm not above my own biases, so I'm not going to conclude it's way fast or not for a while, but damn it kinda felt like (for the first time I've experience with an LLM)",

And will likely be different in another month. For coding use opus 4.5+ or codex 5.2+.\n\n\n- how to plan that work first and come up with a spec and then let it go implement. You need to tell it the end result vs just the next step with no sense of what it is trying to accomplish. \n\n\n- How to setup coding structure for the agents (type checking, precommits checks, linting, testing suites) \n\n\n- how to close the loop so the agents can see the results and iterate (local sandbox with good fast cli tooling),\n\n\n-  how to manage context when working with the agents (what it means to have fresh context vs hot context vs polluted memory)\n\n\n- you essentially have to tech lead the agents through the job vs writing the lines of code. \n\n\n- How to balance and temper it's relentlessness with good engineering practices. What it's good at vs bad at.  Today anyway. \n\n\n\n\nOn the positive side, I've always thought of engineering as a creative job but I'm usually too tired after work to enjoy it as a hobby.

Matching your requirements against the logic, and making sure that your code really meets what you *should* be doing in a way that's going to also meet future requirements is whats hard, and kills projects. When you're dealing with large application's, that's very tricky\n\nI suspect that initially people get very hyped because you've suddenly got a tool that can generate code, which can and will solve problems. But its not helping with the stuff that's actually *hard* about software engineering, because it inherently can't design a custom system for something with how these tools work. It can't get you to understand what's actually happening, and the more you vibe code - the more you distance yourself from understanding the code - which is directly counterproductive in the long term. The nightmare situation for any software project is when you've completely lost track of the architecture, and its all spaghetti\n\nWe've gone through several cycles of people being incredibly excited for these tools, and then pulling back again when they realise that writing any old code that works in an isolated context is not the challenging part. I could crack out a basic app in a short space of time that solves a problem (and I have done many times, especially if you permit plagiarism), but making something that can be built on and last is what's hard\n\nEdit:\n\nMost people in this sub are also extremely junior despite the name",

AIs do some interesting things but ultimately too many little details are too wrong for it to be useful.

In particular I'm not finding that the amount of editing I have to do is going down as these \"better\" AIs come into play. Because yes I commit the AIs output and then commit my edits and I can compare the two.\n\nNow if any of these \"AI good\" posts treated the situation like an engineer I'd be less sceptical. Because even if I found the AI to be overall useful I'd basically write half a book about all the problems I've found and why overall the cost/benefit is still in favour of the AI. All these flat \"AI good\" with no context are just bots, no engineer talks that way. At the very least engineers tend to address responses pulling up all the obvious problems with the product today.\n\nThere's not a single good source out there talking about AI from an engineering perspective. It is either flat hype or some meaningless comparison to some other technology with the insistence that because somebody was wrong there that AI must be good too.

But even that has allowed me to get so much more done so quickly. It's really a matter of giving myself the time to get comfortable with the workflows and developing a good intuition for what works and what doesn't. Steve Yegge's [stages](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04) are a pretty good mental model for thinking about this. I'd say I'm squarely in stage 5 myself.\n\nThere are easy things you should always do, like creating a CLAUDE.md file and/or an AGENTS.md file, agent skills in the form SKILL.md, and being very liberal about having the agent create new skills for itself whenever it manages to nail down a workflow, [subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) for roles and context management. I've also found that having it create a scratchpad for itself where it will write down any important findings or insights that it discovers in the course of trying to solve a problem helps a lot with agent handoff and context compaction.\n\nOn the harness side of things, the fact that it's running in an agentic loop rather than a chat interface already gives you a really good starting point, and the way you extend that is going to depend on the nature of what you work on. To give an example: I had some JSON files that followed a schema that I needed to migrate over to a newer version. Rather than have the agent try to do the conversion itself, I just had it look at the two schemas and write me a schema migration script. And then it just calls the script. Or I might need it to make some API calls and figure out some kind of workflow. I don't want it to have figure out the workflow and make the API calls itself every time, so I have it write me a deterministic script that makes the API calls, and then it just runs the script. Or I might need to do a bunch of math or graph processing. I don't trust it to do math, so what do I do? You guessed it: write me a script that uses a specialized math or graph theory library, and have it run that every time. And it can adapt the script in response to edge cases that it might encounter or evolving requirements. And it just gets better and better at working in the environment you've built for it because it can encode the domain knowledge it's learned in the artifacts that it's produced for itself (the scripts, the scratchpad, etc.), so a new agent doesn't have to rebuild all of that context from scratch.\n\nThere's at least three modes of agentic loops that I've seen people experiment with: there's the script/CLI-driven loop (what I've been talking about thus far); the functional/service contract loop (using something like [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) to encapsulate the functionality you want to give it in tightly-scoped functions with typing and validation), and there's the MCP approach.\n\nThe latter two are conceptually elegant because they look a lot like how you do good software development. But then you try the script/CLI approach and you realize it's much more powerful because it can just write software to better enable it to do things that it couldn't do, and it almost starts to look like recursive self-improvement (at the agent level, not the model level, of course).",

I've found LLMs to be awful at working in complex, performance portable, math heavy code. They regurgitate the textbook solution, rather than the one tuned for the problem at hand. Or when there is an overlap in domains, for example ray tracing for scientific visualization vs for computer graphics, it is completely impossible to get the LLM to focus on the correct context. The bigger training corpus from industry completely pollutes the output. \n\nTo your point though, I think this is why a lot of their math heavy code output is junk. Most math heavy code in the training data is written by mathematicians or physicists who can't code. It sucks. I know math and physics and I can code, and I have higher standards.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I use LLMs all the time. They're great for one-shot scripts, for interpolating and generating documentation, and useful rubber ducks for debugging. They're even excellent assistants for mathematical proofs and derivations. (If you keep a careful eye on them and verify their output.) But they are not good at writing fast, scale-able, maintainable simulation code.",

What actually happens is you get decent boilerplate, then spend 40 minutes debugging why it misunderstood your auth flow or silently dropped an edge case you mentioned three prompts ago. For small scripts and one-off tools, sure, it's a real timesaver. I built an internal CSV parser in maybe 20 minutes that would've taken me 2 hours. But the moment you're in a codebase with 15 services and shared state across three of them, the LLM starts confidently writing code that compiles and does absolutely the wrong thing. My theory is the hype cycle runs on demo energy. Demos are always greenfield, always small scope, always the happy path. Nobody's recording a YouTube video of Claude getting confused by their company's custom ORM for the third time in a row.

It's almost like LLMs are best suited in the hands of technical people that have the knowledge to produce very detailed instructions. Personally I think AI will be an absolute bust on the front of replacing non technical jobs. Theres a few fields like graphic design that have been devastated by it, but for the most part AI will not be able to replace people. It will be an extremely useful tool to developers however",

My work is not clean cookie cutter cut requirements, yet everybody is sounding like AI can work off if even vague requirements better than a human can.

          "text": "Hey, I’m a SWE in a FAANG and an AI power user, I’ve been coding without AI for years before ChatGPT came out.\n\nI’ll be very honest, I get that all this can feel like hype, it’s very hard to find the right tool/model if you don’t spend some time knowing what’s the best, and everything keeps changing. But if you don’t feel a huge productivity gain with AI yet, you are doing something wrong. It’s not anymore a matter of knowing if AI is good for your use case, it’s a matter of knowing how it can be.\n\nFirst of, if you are not using it already, use Claude Code with Opus 4.6. Sonnet 4.6 is also good but I suggest trying what’s best first, to have an idea of what’s possible, then do bother with cost saving.\n\nThen, by experience, 99% of the tasks that this setup cannot achieve is because of a lack of context, or lack of capabilities, it’s almost never intelligence. So if you work in a big codebase, ask Claude Code (CC) to update the CLAUDE.md with a high level overview of the repo and its architecture, and keep some up to date lower level CLAUDE.md in each main submodules.\n\nFor context issues, ask yourself « what would I tell a newcomer that has to work on the project? ». If you’d give him a link to the internal docs, do so with Claude too. Use the plan mode (Shift + Tab) when asking for a big feature so that the agent asks questions back. Leverage the Skills feature to store information about internal tools that he can open anytime and not fill the conversation every time. If you are using a library that has been updated recently, ask the agent to read the whole documentation online and build a tree of all the relevant URLs so that he can find up to date knowledge by himself.\n\nAs for capabilities, ask yourself « what do I DO when I’m working, to debug, to deploy, etc ». If your app runs in docker, give the agent docker access, specify the names of the containers and ask to run and debug himself. Don’t add any friction where you would need to copy paste anything, run a command, you should just validate commands (make sure they are safe), and whitelist all commands that will always be safe. If there is something you do that the agent can’t do (needs physical intervention, needs to browse the website visually to test it, click some buttons…), it’s better to spend some time trying to find an alternative/a solution than do it manually every time, it will have a huge impact on long term. If you are searching for answers on Slack, add the Slack MCP. If you use Chrome to navigate the frontend and trigger some workflows, look into Computer Use feature, or web automation frameworks. If you need to go to a VM and do whatever, setup an SSH connection for the agent do that he can do that.\n\n\nAnyway, my conclusion would be that these tools require new skills for the users. You need to understand the limitations of LLMs and how these tools work around them. It will not work perfectly out of the box, and I think the main issue is that the models don’t have much initiative. For example, they assume you know exactly what you want and if there is a better alternative they will not mention it and will just follow your instructions. You need to explicitly ask them to be more critical, to be more autonomous. This will probably change in the future, and there is definitely a progress in this with the 4.6 series.",

Not as much training data and not everything is text, all assets are binary. Some games in Unreal Engine are entirely created with Blueprints.

          "text": "Non-technical users will be building apps. Like low-code before it. CItizen Developers will make us all better developers. Also, the reality is you don't need 4 months to build a simple internal tool that does reporting and a few automation workflows used by 3 people. There is no business ROI to have a team of 4 developers and a budget of $600,000 in man hours to build something that is used by 3 people in a department.\n\nLets all just agree there is no ROI there for costly engineering. But that is what we are competing with. Go up one level to an app that services 3,000 employees, the Base 44 slop done by some department manager still has value. They have domain knowledge that we don't. They know how their co-workers and siloes work and their workflow.\n\nSo we are basically competing with that. And  we know it. I recently worked on one od those 4 developer $600k projects scoped for 4 months of engineering. And we are just replicating the POC/MVP that was built.\n\nIn fact, it is better than any Figma I've used. We know what they want and those sloppy MVC teaches us the business domain and illustrate way better than any Jira story write up. One day, some day, those POCs will be it. Right now, they are 80-90% good enough. We just have the last mile , last 10% advantage. I am honeslty fine with it. My whole team knows that. \"We are competing against people using AI\"\n\nI am glad this is happening as it exposes the wasteful projects done in the past that costed millions and millions to develop and maintain when we could of either bought it off the shelf. Or minimized resources just to build \"Just enough\" without the traditional over-complexity. If someone cost $150 an hour and spends 4 weeks to do some front end responsive scaling and sprinkle some random layout, is that effort worth $24,000 for that user story? When it is used by two people maybe twice every 2 years? When a now-code automation does it with 2 clicks? Then it is thrown out 6 months later because design fancies something else, a different layout. Do that three times a year, the org is wasting close to 100K on what? A button click that is hardly ever used by no one?\n\nI rather focus on the last mile, the last 10% value type projects. As those work will always be harder to replace by LLMs. Some devs have blinders. But when I dissect user stories and ask, is that worth worth $60,000? Wouldn't the company be better served with buying a license for a COTs system that cost $200? So this is a shakedown to expose these ROI value propositions. I hope more engineers see that.",

They get sloppy because the spec is underspecified and the feedback loop is weak.\n\nThe big productivity gains people report usually come from two places. One is decomposition. You keep the plan in your head and use the model to execute tight, well-scoped chunks. The other is iteration speed. You let it draft, you review, you correct, you regenerate, and you keep the loop short. That turns it into a high-throughput assistant rather than a replacement engineer.\n\nDesign docs are a perfect example. If you ask for a design doc from scratch, you often get generic mush because the model has no ground truth about your constraints, tradeoffs, and decisions. If you instead feed it the actual decisions and ask it to write specific sections, add edge cases, or tighten language, it becomes useful.\n\nSame with code. The “2 to 3x” stories are usually people using it for boilerplate, tests, refactors, glue code, migration scripts, API clients, UI scaffolding, and repetitive internal tooling. They are not letting it drive architecture. They are compressing the parts of engineering that are time expensive but conceptually straightforward.\n\nOn the “PRs merged immediately” point, that’s a process choice. If a team stops reviewing, they will ship faster until the quality bill comes due. That’s not evidence the models are flawless. It’s evidence the org changed its risk tolerance.\n\nSo you’re not crazy. Your experience matches reality. The hype is conflating two different things. The tools can materially speed up execution when the human supplies tight scope and judgment. They are still unreliable when you ask for autonomy over ambiguous problems.",

Agents run out of context fast. Replace them at the first sign of context loss. “You’re absolutely right—“ is a sure sign that the LLM is out of context.\n2. Keep a doc where your LLM can record the changes they’ve made for whatever project/task you’re working on. Have them update it regularly with key decisions and implementation details. Also ask for a restoration prompt in this doc to help the next agent.\n3. Provide a spec as markdown for the task/project you are working as a source of truth. \n\nAgents can be more helpful and make things much easier when used alongside you, not as a replacement of you. You are the agents brain, the agent is just a very eager junior engineer looking to please. Use your knowledge and experience to guide them rather than to fight them.",

The thing is, getting really great results out of AI \\*right now\\* takes a really specific kind of person.  It's less a dev mindset and more a dev manager mindset.    \n  \nThing is, it doesn't matter.  I've been in the trenches with this stuff since pre-release beta.  It has gotten progressively better at a pretty measurable rate and that rate is not linear.  Within a year or two here, it won't matter whether you're \"good\" with AI or not right now because it'll just be good enough to compensate for the relative lack of clarity that drives most people to think AI is crap.  I'd say, don't sweat it.  There is a really tight window here, where if you're \"good\" with AI, you can do some real damage ahead of the curve.  But pretty soon the models will be good enough that everyone will be able to get those kinds of results.  \"Software Engineer\" will be replaced with something more along the lines of an architect that puts systems together - a sort of combined dev/pm/bsa/manager.

If anything, it makes mediocre programmers be able to write, okay stuff, effectively making the SWE distribution go from a balanced one, to a positively skewed one, at least code wise. Some of the shit I saw during the beginning of my career would never exist with today's LLMs, simply because they would pump out OK code, no matter how mediocre the dev. \n\nNow, will they CHANGE the world? I'm not sure. The way I see it, it all hinges on whether or not AI can review its own code. From a programming point of view, it can use tests as a guidelines for \"fixing\" things, so it could be a helpful tool to fix bugs, but I believe it still can't understand intent that well, as in the intent behind a feature, or if a PR is good or not.\n\nSo Unless you're at a startup where pumping out code is more important than it working, or it bringing value, I don't see humans being taken away from the equation, and I would go out on a limb and say that any perceived gain of productivity is squashed by the gigantic amounts of code LLMs can pump out. Now, you can't ask a software engineer to squeeze out more brain juice, so my only logical conclusion is, now we spend whatever gained time reading code and correcting/iterating on generated code. Are we more productive? It's not really important. The bottleneck is still mental energy, and LLMs aren't giving us any.\n\nIt's a weird state of things right now. LLMs as of now are just a way to squeeze us out more. Give a little bit of convenience when generating code and in return being asked to take 10X the mental load just because. Non technical people don't understand. They think writing the code is the hard part, and touting LLMs to be such a revolutionary technology is political suicide for any SWE. Is giving in to the new expectations, new expectations where you're supposed to deliver a lot more at the same salary. \n\nOn my end, I embrace AI. It's okay, for the most part. It makes a lot of tedious shit easier, and reduces friction in a lot of places!!! But it isn't taking my job away. And it's important that people temper their expectations of it. Touting llms to be all this and that is political suicide for all SWEs.",

Downvoted the shit out of me but you are all riding horses and bitching about how this new \"automobile\" is a complete fad because you tried out a rinky prototype one time and you heard it needs some kind of weird fuel.\n\nOr you're swinging a chainsaw like an ax and then saying it sucks.( Or pick whatever poor analogy you want)\n\nI'm not saying this to be snarky. Honestly I read so many comments and it just make me angry how damn dull and short sighted people are. \n\nI don't know how this industry goes but I know the people that don't start using the chainsaw are the ones that won't be around as long as the ones that do. \n\nI'm not the one making the rules I just feel 90% confident that is how it will go. \n\nI've been making apps and projects that would have easily taken me 5-10x the time and some just not possible. I've just seen a team that's almost the exact same people for 6 years do things in the last 2 weeks that's would have taken them probably 2 months.\n\nYou read and hear from so many credible engineers not just saying a confident statement like \"crypto is big trust me bro\" but actually showing proof of the thing that was built. Read through OPs post for so many examples.\n\nPeople are commenting about the emperor having no clothes to try and sound clever, when the irony is many saying it's a fad are the ones that have the incentive to not believe the truth. \n\nI'm more excited and terrified than I've ever been about tech and I've been in software for 15 years. I've worked on everything from large scale web apps, data engineering, embedded/hardware, supply chain security, and data science. With some really good engineers and in one case an elite nerd that was a top ten in the world in his complicated niche domain. \n\n\nWe have reached somewhere into the realm of oscalating between \"pretty good\" to \"really good\" engineer but it gets there 50x faster when given the task with guidance still needed especially around the architecture and high level vision. \n\n\nWe are still a ways away from it cracking into the level of the elite nerd especially on the innovation front... but damnit I don't see a reason why it can't get to sparks of that.\n\n\nAnd so many are yelling about AI hype and coming up with the most copium petty comments when just zooming back 5 years and how far the space has come since the Will Smith eating spaghetti days... just kidding that was JUST three years ago. \n\n\n\n There is no \"incentive\" for me to push this. \n\nCall me whatever or think whatever, but it doesn't really matter. You'll look back and see how many signs there were that this is the start of the new era. \n\nI don't really need to argue the same way i don't need to argue that exercise helps increase strength, gives you longer life, or helps mood.\n\n\nI don't need to hear from Twitter how great it is or watch some YouTube bro. I'm just actively living out seeing it in action. \n\nI'm going to continue to build my side projects and iterate on the workflow and other implications (it's not just about code). I'm going to continue to see my team be able to build in whole new ways and have so much more autonomy to just go solve problems.\n\n See us do the hundred tasks that are \"easy\" but have sat for years. Do all the huge complex bits that needed so many iterations now have 3 learning loops in 3 days and be 50% of the way for a 3 month refactor. \n\n\nSeeing the absolutely soul sucking work of sorting through hundreds of jira tickets and thousands of slack channels and threads for all the shit of conversations and Google docs and confluence pages and scattered documentation reduced by 80-90% so I can focus on work during my deep work time.\n\n\"But it made this one stupid thing happen and wrote bad code\". Do you work with people?!? I guess you've never started at a company and had a look at their 10 year old codebase.\n\n\nNo one gives a shit about the code. Do you ever admire a bridge? Is an elevator art? What about the sewer? The scissors your barber uses? Pick whichever of that list you really don't give a shit about and imagine less shits. So probably not the sewer. \n\n\nPeople want things that work. And lots of what they make work. Some doesn't. Just like all of our stuff.\n\nThe tooling to fix those things and smoother out the rough bits has the best talent in the world plus 1000x people at companies working through that. Do you not think those things will be consequentially better still in 5 months? What about 5 years?\n\n\nIf you've reached the end of my rant then congratulations. I award you no points. And may God have mercy on your soul. \n\n\nI don't know what the end game is. I don't know what the future of work looks like. I don't know if it's an actual Utopia or something of what we fear.\n\n\nAll I know is that I didn't start the fire, but there are clear flames everywhere and people want to dismiss the heavy smoke as simply bad weather. Ignoring the evacuation warning until they the heat gets to their doorstep. \n\n\n\n",

I've answered hard questions properly and still didn't pass interviews, I felt that I bombed interviews and yet still I passed them.\n\nI was a team lead for a few years and I got to interview people quite a bit, and let me tell you, the interviewer is as much of a factor in this as you are.\n\nIt takes effort and time to set up an interview pipeline, what are the right questions to ask? How do I gauge your skill? Do I have alternative questions in case I land on something you're not very good at, but perhaps you have something else that is better? How do I sprinkle you the right hints and how do I test whether you're good at communicating? It's an insanely fucking hard job, and like any job, the skill of the interviewer and the effort put in the pipeline is a huge factor.\n\nYou could be a genius engineer, but if a shitty interview pipeline only asks leetcode hards, and only measures you whether you pass all tests in 60 minutes, is that really a good filter? Does that even say anything about you other than you know how to code leetcode?\n\nDon't take it personally, a lot of companies are shit at interviewing, and revel the fact that you might just work for their competitor instead and drive them out of business. If you're good at what you do, then you will game their systems or stumble on a company with a better engineering culture.\n\nAnd even if the pipeline is good and the interviewer is skilled, there are other factors, such as not needing someone exactly of your profile/skillset at the moment, or not really having chemistry with the interviewer, or they simply not liking the look of your eyelashes. You can't control any of these things, except the eyelash part, but since we're developers, we are doomed to a life of somewhat un-attractiveness anyway.\n\nTake the L, give them the finger for being too stupid to see the brilliance of [TheTopG\\_\\_\\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTopG___/), and move on to the next one.",

Anyways they didn't ask me any coding questions for a Senior SWE role.  It was behavioral type questions learning about how I operate day to day along with technical type conversations.\n\nI guess they assumed my 15 YOE was good enough to verify my coding skills.  Anyways I grew suspect of the company since the 4 interviews were basically just conversations.  The people that interviewed me were all from big tech companies like Waymo, Apple, and Google looking at their LinkedIn page.\n\nMany employees graduated from Stanford and other big named schools.  Yet here I was graduated from some no-name state school working at private no-name non-tech companies in non-tech cities on the east coast.  The recruiter randomly found me on LinkedIn and that was how I heard about this company.\n\nThe quoted salary range from the in house recruiter was something like 175K - 210K.  I guess they liked me so much that their initial offer was for 225K.  The problem is I couldn't shake the nagging feeling the lack of technical coding questions was a red flag.\n\nAnyways I turned down the offer.  Since then this company has had a series A in 2024 and a series B in 2025 for 100 million.  It grew from about 30 employees in 2023 to, according to LinkedIn, over 100 employees today.\n\nAnyways I didn't have a strong point to this story.  It was just an anecdote I thought of as you said you don't do Leetcode interviews and I thought that was a red flag for some company I interviewed at years ago. Obviously I was wrong, lol.",

They are often at the dentist or had to go pick the daughter. Their definition of work is booking meetings and literally have someone start some podcast nonsense; sometimes you catch them not able to answer questions because they are not listening during their pointless meetings. These are the people interviewing! I started creating technical videos to showcase work for solutions provide to things the never had or imagine having, then suddenly everyone has an opinion and start throwing jargon which they seem to understand at surface level but not deep enough, as in practice what the claim have done doesn’t work as they think. I show them data, graphics, performance, benchmark examples wasting my time, they don’t even check. Eventually the manager complain the are taking too long to approve PR and there’s no actionable feedback and these losers approve. Zero chances since weeks! Then complain there are too may PR to review that depend on each other. Or, that the experimental library release is way ahead to the actual “latest” version.

Technical skills are only half of what I'm looking for, and you can often judge those through looking at previous work and conversation with experienced techies. The other half revolves around soft skills - can we communicate? How well will they fit into the team? Can they manage multiple tasks at the same time? Can they adjust their communication style based on who they are talking to. \n\nSadly, there are very many poor interviewers out there who over-index on all the wrong things.

This was a tipping point where I decided to radically cut down on exposure to all platforms where AI hype is mainly advertised through. I guess it's obvious too that it did wonders to my mental health in no time. But I'm still guilty of jumping on my account to check out subs like this in a convenient manner.\n\nAnd no, I'm not a complete AI denier.

Millions of desperate people will be trying to survive at the exact same time. When everyone is forced to sell off their homes and liquidate their stocks just to buy groceries, the market will completely crater. Your assets will be worth pennies. Without a middle class to spend discretionary income, the fallout will be absolute. The restaurants, hotels, and local businesses that rely on that money will be wiped out overnight, leaving hollowed-out ghost towns behind.\n\nThen you realize you have no good prospects of pulling yourself and your family out of poverty. People love to say you can just go back to school and get a new job, but that is a fantasy. What bank is going to approve a student loan for someone with absolutely zero income? Even if you somehow find the money, the few trade and college programs tied to the remaining human jobs will be violently cutthroat. And with a massive, desperate population begging for those exact same scraps, corporations will pay rock-bottom starvation wages.\n\nFinally you either starve to death or kill yourself because there’s no hope.",

Our Director told us that if we don’t start using AI they’ll find someone who will. The messaging on his end was terrible but in the interest of keeping my job I kept my mouth shut.\n\nThe issue with this whole AI business is that the tech gets hyped but the benchmarks they run? Nonsense. For example, $20K in tokens and Claude built a non-functioning C compiler that ran Doom slower than dirt. This despite using 37 years of torture test data and a clean slate. Yet it was hyped as this massive achievement. Oh and still relied on GCC and without GCC it didn’t work. So what were they hyping?\n\nDoomsayers are right to be skeptical but the reality is that AI is a good productivity tool. It’s a way to scaffold oft used code. It’s a good way to have a second set of eyes. Rely on what AI can do well and I’ve found that it’s a wonderful tool to use.",

          "text": "There's a few aspects to it.\n\nOne is the simple notion that AI productivity gains gives companies a free license to conduct layoffs without fear of public backlash or running afoul of other laws. At least that's how their risk assessment frames things. So it matters not whether these productivity gains are real or imagined; what matters is that they effectively let the company pin the layoffs on something that's hard to push back on as a practical matter. Meanwhile, please don't look at the number of H-1B Visa applicants that same large company is applying to sponsor and please don't note how that number is suspiciously similar to the number of layoffs they just announced because they're now so much more productive.\n\nAnother is the notion that \"increased productivity\" from AI comes with tradeoffs that companies simply don't like to acknowledge: the AI output is lower quality than the previous human outputs, but it's way cheaper and faster so they simply don't care. There's nothing *inherently* wrong with trading risk and quality for speed and cost, but the perverse incentive here is that companies have every reason in the world to not acknowledge the full magnitude and consequences of the tradeoff being made here. They only want to see the \"faster and cheaper\" part, not the \"worse\" part and they certainly don't want to think through the negative externalities that might result from their outputs being lower quality. Depending on what domain this is being applied to, the consequences range from annoying to lethal. Customer support bots being shit is annoying, but a medical device company slapping AI into their products might literally kill people. Do you think that medical device company is going to explicitly acknowledge that their most profitable quarter came knowingly and predictably at the expense of X number of excess deaths and they made that tradeoff deliberately? No way.\n\nFinally, I think some people are simply not skilled enough in the domain to which they're applying AI (or imagining how AI will be applied) that they genuinely don't realize how bad it is. Whenever somebody not skilled in a domain talks about AI replacing people in another domain (or their own domain that they're junior in), I always ask them some version of this: \"Imagine the difference between me using Chat GPT to do your job, versus you using Chat GPT to do your job. If you're imagining an immense difference in output quality and the way the interactions work because of your domain expertise and my lack of it, that's exactly why AI isn't going to take anybody's job any time soon, at least not without a large drop in quality. It's just a tool for people already skilled to use.\"\n\nI'm not sure if this applies outside software development, but there's also the idea that productivity gains only come if you're willing to not invest the time to fully understand the LLM generated code. Yes, LLMs write very plausible code quickly, but if you're not actually taking time to *fully* understand the system and the implications of the code changes from the LLM, when you're actually trading off (besides quality) is simply *knowledge* of how your system works. This is one of those things that doesn't cause any acute damage, but it slowly chips away at quality and scalability and cost and it just generates so much code that nobody actually understands that it sets things up for a massive cascading system failure mode that will absolutely kill you when it triggers.",

          "text": "I’m not going to write out a whole argument because I feel like most devs in this subreddit have already formed their opinions. I sort of feel like you’re asking a loaded question and don’t really want me to explain how AI tools help me.\n\nApologies in advance for any typos. I did spend a while on this comment, but I’m writing on mobile. \n\nI agree that 10x productivity numbers are suspect. But some observations:\n\n- The tools have continued to improve. Even in the last quarter and the last month. If you’re company isn’t paying for access to frontier models, we aren’t really having the same conversation here.\n\n- The “omg your company pays $500-$1000 per dev per month for AI token” posts are super disconnected. That’s a pretty normal productivity tooling budget for most companies even before AI. If you think that number is shocking, then you are either an outlying working at cost-center companies like banking, or you’re disconnected from how much tools normally cost. I guarantee that your company pays overheads like this on its profit centers. So if this number sounds crazy for a dev tool to you, I’m sorry that this is the first time you’re finding out that you are viewed as a cost center. \n\n- With that said, vibe coding still doesn’t work. Debugging, architecting, code structure, test practices, etc have become more important, not less. Now that AI can generate the easy stuff, the hard stuff becomes more of my job. \n\n- Additionally, a lot of my job has been about scaling out AI tools across multiple engineers and dev teams. Really no different than my previous responsibilities as staff engineers. 50 devs using AI tools effectively still generates more productivity than me generating code myself. \n\n- With that said, I *do* generate about 95% of code that I check in. No, it’s not slop. Clear design vision, technical specs, and written down business context really help out. You should’ve had this anyways, right? This was a good practice even before AI. \n\n- I’m not 10x more productive. But maybe 2-3x more productive. Obviously this doesn’t always show up in any metrics that can be measured. If I spend an afternoon fixing 3 user facing bugs instead of 1, obviously that’s not going to show up in any sort of metric that matters. I know all the devs here would flip out of their managers asked them to quantify their productivity, since we all know that measuring the effectiveness of developers is incredibly difficult. So why are my claims about AI tooling being held to that standard? Can you pull numbers which show that your favorite IDE or programming languages makes you x more productive. I will recognize that this is an problem for AI labs: they are investing real money but it’s possible the benefits won’t show up in monetary returns or GDP growth. Obviously those things only *sort of* measure human well being. It’s possible to build genuinely better software that benefits humanity without it reflecting in GDP growth. \n\nAnother important point is that I was an AI skeptic until a few months ago. I predicted we would hit a wall, but frankly we didn’t, so I admitted I was wrong.\n\nI also am not a bot and I don’t financially benefit from AI in any way. I’m skeptical about some of the more outlandish claims about the benefits of AI. But I do believe that the current tools make me 2-3x more productive.",

I don't want to add to the noise but I what I actually don't \"get\" is the unrestrained excitement people have over this. There is, I have to say, from this community, a little bit too much dismissal as well.\n\nI am a very experienced engineer now (nearly 3 decades) and I have helped build an \"AI company\" in the early doors times. This stuff is different, it is very good and it is improving. I think a few of you out there will already be learning that it is as good as it's steering, but as you evolve that, you can get it to stay on track for more and more cycles and the redirections it needs become increasingly minimal.\n\nIt is \\*incredible\\* tech, and I do think we are in trouble. Nobody should be happy, because even if you feel you can wield it like prometheus, many can't (across industries and fields) and could well be swallowed, and they will not sit back and die without an awful lot of turmoil.\n\nFrankly, there are pretty significant fields and professions that are \\*already\\* redundant and just haven't woken up to it.\n\nI also have to say that as the industry has grown in my tenure, the average quality of an engineer has dropped significantly. Sorry to say that, but too many bootcamps and people just looking for a comfortable office job. Those people are dead fucked. When your colleagues are sharing their experiences with this tech, pay careful attention to who is finding success with it (even if they complain). I know the people who would be software engineers if it paid national average wage and I know the people who would be software engineers if it paid minimum wage... and those people do very well with this tech as a partner and assistant and eventually get it doing their bidding largely with nudges and pushes. They know how to architect a codebase, and to avoid confusion in the context and they can iterate and build increasing complexity.\n\nThe people who haven't paid attention, don't care, and it works on their machine.... are the ones saying, \"this shit doesn't work at all, it keeps falling over, introducing stupid bugs, getting caught in a loop....\", etc.\n\nThe reason I have not replaced all the shit code that barely works that has been written by this people... has been a lack of time.\n\nAgain, I suppose I am adding to the noise here, but I hear \"wrongness\" from both sides (imo).\n\nI think it is simple and scary. This stuff is not perfect, but it is very good. We should be very alert to the fact that had somebody told you 10 years ago that your computer would happily work for hours on a coding problem and you would be a little bit excited when it finally got confused... you would call the men in white coats.

In a rational market, is there any way the market itself wouldn't punish a company for not trying to incorporate technologies that mean they don't have to pay their biggest line item?  \n\nThe doomsayers, as you call them, are trying to sound the alarm, I would imagine.  It's too late, but they are at least trying.  The tools have gotten better at a predictably geometric rate and are accelerating.  The tools this year are orders of magnitude better than the tools this time last year.  And those tools are being used to further accelerate the pace of development.  The better the tools get, the faster and better the NEXT generation of tools, which produces the faster and better NEXT generation of tools.  It's not going to stop improving.  It's not going to be legislatively slowed.  Better smarter AI is always going to be around the corner for the next little while unless we run up against some theoretical wall of which we are not currently aware.  \n\nI'm not even wading into the defense angle, which is a whole other ball of wax.  It's OBVIOUS most of the world powers think that the next wars will be fought in part by AI and are gearing up accordingly.  \n\nThis IS a transformative technology, and it WILL continue to get better.  The business world smells blood and can't see beyond the next quarter's results so they will continue to barrel towards a world where they don't have to pay knowledge workers anymore.  It's not there yet, but each generation of model is bringing us closer, to the point that it's scary close right now.  \n\nOh yeah, and before you go out and get a job as a welder, check out all the latest innovations in robotics!  You really think they're not gonna slap AI in those things the second they can and hire them out as robo-plumbers?\n\nThe writing is basically on the wall.  We're in for major disruption one way or the other from this technology.  People who don't see it - I'd just point you to the comparative benchmarking of the different generations of models.  It is a verifiable fact that they are getting better, and matching or exceeding human capabilities in a large class of general tasks.  And they're not likely gonna get much worse moving forward.  ",

That's my perspective on the subject. If you don't understand how benchmarks work at this point and can't read a graph plotting model performance on benchmarks, well as I've said here and elsewhere doesn't matter.  I mean of course your subjective experience is more important than data to you personally but how do you just pooh pooh away data and results that measure efficacy of models?  Data is data and there is very little wiggle room to interpret published results.  I'm a data guy. I look at a graph of claude performance on benchmarks the last 3 years and there is nothing but inevitability written on a graph like that.  I've seen the curve in a thousand datasets and I know how it ends. I'm not even a doomer - I'm just saying disruption. I'm actually all in on ai and personally can't wait for AGI. I genuinely believe thr benefits will end up outweighing the negatives even if the ride is bumpy getting there. I'm banking on something like AGI will solve the problem even if humans can't.  If I'm wrong then no big deal. But something tells me you're going to end up thinking about comments like this a lot in the next few years regardless of what you believe right now. Might not end up the way I'm predicting, but if you think its nothing, you're probably not accounting for the fact that AI is getting better in leaps and bounds by measurable metrics.  ",

Obviously the \"Everyone will be replaced\" rhetoric is the most dumb conclusion one can get.\n\nHumans are here to stay. Unless our planet becomes so unbearable to human life that we all die and robots will outlive us, nobody is going to be replaced by anything. We will be served by AI and bots and our lives will be exponentially better. Companies need costumers. To have customers, companies need to employ. That's basic economics and companies know that. If they fire everybody, they are just creating infinite amount of competition, since 1 engineer can now produce alone the equivalent of 10, and those laid off engineers have industry knowledge. To survive they will need to create their own business. Big tech also know that and CEOs will need to be reasonable about how much risk they want to take by firing highly skilled people.\n\nPhilosophically speaking, I don't think anyone wants to live in a world where everything is trusted to AI. We all want a reassurance that there is a human in the loop in case things go south. If money disappears from your bank app, do you seriously want to talk to an AI engineer? No! You want someone who you can put in prison for violating the law. AI can't go to prison right now... its kind of a problem, isn't it?\n\nFinally, coding will become an increasingly scarce skill as younger generations have no incentive to code without AI assistance.  Experienced devs will retire. Just like Cobol engineers are still needed and rare to find, so will be experienced engineers that actually know how to code, instead of prompting.\n\nKeep on coding, and everything will be fine.",

The mood shifted very abruptly this year because the tooling went from \"it helps I guess\" to \"holy shit this thing just completed all my sprint work in an afternoon\".\n\n\nI think whats really going on is the dev world is splitting into two camps:\n\n\n1. Devs who work at companies that rapidly adopt new tech and have the resources to go balls to the walls in implementing it. These devs are seeing what this tech is capable of when given extensive documentation, tooling, and a very large repository of high quality code.\n\n\n2. Devs who work at smaller companies or non-tech companies that are slow to adopt new tech, have shoddy development practices, poor documentation, and basically just use AI out of the box. They might also be using obsolete AI products like Copilot and old models, or their company may not allow LLM usage at all and the devs cant be bothered to experiment with it outside of work.\n\n\nGroup 2 hasn't seen what Group 1 has. Group 2 thinks AI still churns out error ridden spaghetti code with no understanding of domain or business rules, while Group 1 is in the process of adapting to a new engineering paradigm.\n\n\n> I can't help but think we are being bombarded by a concentrated marketing effort by AI companies employing bots to disseminate their narratives.\n\n\nThe neat thing about this mindset is it makes it impossible for you to consider you could be wrong.

After spending an ample amount of time on Hacker News and now here I feel like the internet skews the perception of how experienced or knowledgeable the average software developer actually is. These sites automatically filter for developers who are passionate (or at least interested) in the field, so when we read through HN we're getting a veritable who's who of some of the best developers in the world.\n\nBut when I look at my career and the developers I've actually worked with there are plenty of people just trudging by and who aren't overly knowledgeable or productive, and many with poor communication skills. I might even go as far as saying that this is more the norm than exception.\n\nJust curious to get some thoughts on that and if my perception matches reality.",

              "text": "The problem is that the primary software development \"skill\" is solving \"math word problems\". This is different from being able to do math or do logic. It's the talent to phrase a problem in words, then convert that problem into math and analyze it in math terms, and then convert that math result back into words so that a normal person can understand the answer. \n\nWe should all be familiar with our school experiences where very few students were good at math word problems, and that was a huge differentiator. Personally, I've run into students who can get a 100% A+ result on a calculus test (back in the 1980s, so not a grade-inflated A+), yet give them a simple physics problem (block on a frictionless inclined plane) but move \"theta\" from the horizontal angle to the vertical angle. I could give hint after hint after hint (that it's a different formula) but they'd still answer \"m\\*g\\*sin(theta)\" and not \"m\\*g\\*cos(theta)\". So you can have a lot of very smart people, but they're smart because their memory is good, not because they can look at a problem and figure it out from scratch.\n\nSo employers are necessarily trying to acquire the top 5% or so of all possible candidates. The competition is so steep that most employers can't afford that level of talent, so they end up with very bright people who can talk the talk because they can remember everything, but they are much slower at actual problem-solving.",

Most are not going to find themselves working at these types of companies.\n\nSame logic applies to the strength of the average developer. Most people are adequate and can do their jobs. You're in the minority if you are a 10x developer who eats, sleeps and breathes programming. I've worked with exactly 2 developers like that in 7 years across 3 different jobs. Most everyone (me included) is just an average developer who gets their work done and contributes, helps out where they can, and then goes home at 5 to do anything but stare at a screen programming.

Is it on some metric of \"they produce in X interval Y lines of efficient clean code to accomplish some defined outcome in a given common language\"? well that's who can ingest a well written ticket. Is it \"as a partner to stakeholders, they insightfully guide the refinement of the business statement and build the code and automation to suit the goal in a clean and meaningful way?\" then how do you measure that? If it's by the speed and financial success of the project, a personable developer who may not have as much familiarity with data structures as someone who doesn't engage with the ask but memorized a dozen DSA books would be more successful in that metric that no doubt matters more to the business, but we wouldn't call the former a stronger developer in a CS-class vacuum. \n\nIf we were to look at total outcome of career, again define that. Total earnings? The outliers are significantly based on luck, a weak developer who skated in as engineer 150 at Meta would be better than someone strong who chose a series of startups that failed to exit well. Plus, for some money isn't the goal. \n\nIn addition, people lie and talk big game on the internet, I'm sure plenty here have been on panels where someone's HN/LinkedIn presence is full of big talk about creating outcomes but then you put them in a whiteboard session and they can't do a tenth of what they post about. \n\nAll this to say, don't worry much about the internet presence unless you want to leverage that for your career (then back up big talk with skills, please). Focus on what matters for you and grow a little every day to reach that metric of \"better\" for yourself.",

The devs with the most public presence often *are* exceptionally passionate. You occasionally see underskilled devs who bubble up, but often either not for good reasons or not for very long as their voices don't tend to add value to the broader dialogue in which they're participating.\n\nYou see this in other industries as well. Academia has its own version of this. Arts and entertainment have their own version of this. The medical field has its own version of this, and so on.\n\n> there are plenty of people just trudging by and who aren't overly knowledgeable or productive, and many with poor communication skills. I might even go as far as saying that this is more the norm than exception.\n\nDespite my remarks above, I'd still hesitate to make this extrapolation - it's akin to mistaking the mean for the median. I've worked and liaised with various orgs in various verticals. My observation has been that the talent distribution across an org typically seems to be at least approximately normal/bell-curved, with the majority of that org's devs in their own mid-level range (regardless of title or designation), but the bounds of that curve can vary significantly between orgs. I've worked for a few where the mid-levels could be senior or even principal engineers if they just went elsewhere. I've worked for a few where the mid-levels were essentially budding juniors who picked up enough to teach even newer juniors (but budding nonetheless, no slight intended).\n\nCommunication skill tends to vary along the same axis, but \"poor\" communication skill can mean different things when dealing with software engineers. Do they have a generally poor grasp of language itself (i.e., do they write with poor punctuation, spelling, broken SMS-style syntax)? If not, do they have the insight to translate literal code decisions to technical requirements? If so, do they have the insight to translate technical requirements to business requirements? If so, can they articulate those requirements in precision language that enables genuinely compelling dialogue with stakeholders?\n\nMy point being, tailor your expectations not to the market at large, but to the context into which you're sunk. Most of the engineers in that context are going to reflect its average, which may or may not be an objectively low bar to meet.",

Your average developer isn't capable of solving even moderately complex problems. \n\nNow, among those are are employable, they produce sloppy, buggy code... But they produce.\n\nI would estimate about 60-70% of employable devs can only solve problems brute force and do not understand a thing about \"design\" or \"architecture\" regardless of their tenure. There are many problems that are well beyond them. They mostly parrot technical opinions previous team leads have admonished them for.\n\nProbably about 25% are capable and can stumble through all but the hardest problems. They have learned to avoid the worst pitfalls through being burned. They do not actively hone their craft, but they do learn from experience. So, they can solve most problems with \"good enough\" solutions. The hardest problems are still beyond them and they are only sometimes capable of innovating new ideas and thinking through them thoroughly. \n\nAbout 10% are capable. They can move into any field and figure out how to be productive. They actively read and educate themselves, so they know lots about things even if they've never directly experienced them. They can solve just about any problem, but not always optimally. The only exception might be highly scientific problems that require deep training with specific knowledge. They can lead, they can mentor, they can guard dog code bases, projects, business problems. These are your team leads. \n\nAbout 5% are savants. They dream up solutions others cannot. They are truly stimulated by hard problems. They have very high standards. They are constantly educating themselves even as a hobby. They have side projects to play with new tech they've discovered. Their friends and them mostly talk about tech and science. They can do things like imagine a new container orchestration mechanism with a custom kernel designed to achieve specific guarantees. They talk about designing hardware systems with variable baud rates for some arcane reason. They know what the downstream effects of storing principals in a token vs a database and what the trade offs are. They know how to distribute processing across 15000 different compute resources and calculate exactly when it will be done processing. \n\nThese are your principal engineers. You won't get to work with them much. Companies usually identify them early and put them on high priority, critical problems. They are usually highly paid\n\n\nRule of thumb, if you don't have a reading list, you're one of the first two categories.",

It was reframing what \"watching me code\" means. In a real pair programming session, the other person is a collaborator. In an interview, they're an evaluator. Your brain knows the difference even if you tell it otherwise, and the evaluator context triggers the exact same fight-or-flight as public speaking. So I started treating every interview coding session like I'm explaining my thought process to a junior dev. Narrate everything out loud. \"Ok, I need to iterate through this, and I'm thinking about edge cases like empty input...\" It sounds awkward but it actually slows down the panic spiral because you're engaging the verbal part of your brain which competes with the anxiety loop.\n\n\n\nAlso, fwiw, the interviewers who are good at their job know this happens. The ones who judge you for freezing on a switch statement after seeing your system design are just bad interviewers. Can't fix that part.",

The high level of cortisol is to blame (as a matter of fact it could be measured to confirm).\n\nHow to mitigate? There are plenty advices when searching \"how to reduce fight-or-flight response\" and \"how to mitigate imposter syndrome\", but hard to say which is most suitable for a specific person. Food and drink might affect the hormones, as well as the other sources of stress. Some people advise to tell about it to the interviewer, some companies could give the offline homework instead of the live coding.\n\nInterview practice matters, of course. But sometimes, people don't have the right focus. Certain things needs to be repeated many times to be automated, cached, because stress hormones worsens the recall. It is typical, that people use the approach when something is done, it can be forgotten. With the leetcode and similar this approach is terrible. People solve hundreds of problems, but they forget most of them soon, or it resides in a place in memory they cannot reach during the interview. It's good to roughly know the area or possible tasks and practice them multiple times.",

I can code in front of others people, no problem, but I am a humble person, I know how to say \"I don't remember, I need to check the docs\". I actually think this is an important quality (not pretending you know and remember everything, nobody does). But I also know most of the times, in interviews, this is interpreted as a sign of weakness. So, I just accepted failures as part of the process. And I allow myself to let the reasonable companies value what is actually important in me. I will not pretend to be someone I am not, or spend months preparing for a non-sense itw, just to loose this momentary skill few months later when I am no longer interviewing.  \n  \nSo, your feeling is totally normal and justified, for several reasons:  \n  \n1 - Flight or fight mode exists for a reason. It probably helps you more than you imagine.  \n2 - I know of no other profession where we need to prove ourselves over and over again when changing to a new company, in a completely unrealistic setting/test. Now imagine doing the same with medical doctors, lawyers, sales people. SWE go through a stress during recruitment that is almost unmatched in other careers.  \n3 - Coding interviews are mostly dumb. I have failed few times for the most ridiculous reasons. For instance, the last time the interviewer asked me to code on Figma (yes, Figma, you read it right). I am not used to not having code completion (nobody is). So I went to check on the documentation - which I was told that I had the right to do - just to be sure a method really works as I remembered. When I got a rejection email, HR gave me the feedback that I googled too much. I never used google in an interview, just opened official documentation, but yeah, fine, they don't even communicate well what I did. So be it.  \n4 - Most talented engineers I know hates code interviews, when they are the ones being tested.\n\nI think you just need to accept that failure might be part of the process. Nobody wins all the time. Most world class SWE talent failed multiple interviews. Don't be too hard on yourself.",

I spent years as a lead and a significant portion of my time was: reminding people to update tickets, following up on blockers, nudging PRs, and piecing together release status from 5 different conversations.\n\nJIRA tell you the state of things but don't actually close the loop on accountability. Most of the real coordination still happens offline and disappears into Slack.\n\nIs this just how it is? How do you all handle it? Has anything actually made this better? Please help. Tired of doing just status syncs :(\n\n*Edit: Thank you all for the thoughtful responses - both those who feel this pain deeply and those who've found ways to solve it through culture and leadership. Both perspectives are genuinely helpful. For those still struggling with this, I'm building a tool to address it and looking for early testers. DM me if interested*",

Company leadership on the other hand doesn't care about it. They need to solve business problems and deliver features/revenue. A manager/lead job is to quite literally be a bridge in between. You have to figure out how to motivate some of the smartest people you know to solve the problem the company cares about.\n\n\nWhat you're describing is pretty much a byproduct of this friction. It shows up differently in different companies. Some have strong processes, others have strong engineering culture. Sometimes your leadership can let some red tape slide, other times they won't. Sometimes the team you lead cares about the processes other times they're least bothered. Your job is the coach the team and manage up so these two sides of the coin gel together to produce results.",

If you close one as \"I'm not doing this,\" at most places, at least some of the time, someone will come to you and tell you to open it back up and pretend you're going to do it. If you explain that you're not going to do it, they're fine with this, they just want the appearance that it's \"being worked on.\" So soon you accumulate a bunch of tickets that don't reflect reality. Or else you try to reassign work that doesn't belong to you, and it comes back along with someone telling you that it's politically sensitive and you just need to keep it in your queue for now.\n\nNow multiply this across every tool in the org that a SWE deals with on a daily basis. You end up with a bunch of noise, and since you can't rely on the tools to tell you what actually needs doing vs. what merely needs to be maintained as the appearance of work that will be done, you start to ignore updating the real work because it's too much effort to separate it from the fake work.\n\nThe place I worked where this was not allowed, it was very transparent what everyone was doing at all times. You could just look at the issue tracker and see someone's actual work queue with the prioritizations. We didn't bother making predictions more than a week or two out because the org had found that the error bars were so large on those plans that it wasn't worth wasting time on, so we just put things in order instead.\n\nAlso, everything was tracked in the issue tracker. If you're working on something, then it's documented in a ticket, even if it's not code-related. Status reports pretty much went away because your status was always available for anyone that wanted to look. Doing a weekly sync was simply pulling up everyone's queue to see what their next couple of weeks looked like, and no one had to do any prep for it except scan their tickets to make sure everything was up to date.",

Everyone posts blockers and progress in a channel by 10am. If someone does not post, the team notices before I do. Peer accountability is way more effective than manager reminders.\n\n2. PRs got a 24-hour SLA. Not enforced by me, enforced by the team agreement. If a PR sat for more than a day without review, it became the top priority for the next available person. We tracked it for two weeks and review times dropped by 60%.\n\n3. I stopped being the router for information. If two engineers needed to coordinate, I would connect them directly instead of relaying messages. Took about a month for people to default to talking to each other first.\n\nThe underlying issue is usually that the team treats coordination as the manager's job instead of everyone's job.

Because of that, I let my manager know that if she noticed any hint of a drop in my performance, I would like to know so there was absolutely no chance of me getting fired.\n\nA bit of background for my manager and myself. She gave me a bad performance review last time round(it was totally fair, I wasn't performing due to health reasons and being very down mentally) and then she gave me goals to complete. I crushed all the goals, she said that I was doing a great job and that it was a night and day difference in how I was performing. \n\nTwo weeks ago we had a 1:1 and I asked her about her expectations for a promotion and she was guiding me on how to frame my performance review to be more likely to get it.\n\nToday, I was let go. As it happens I was about to hand in my notice and it worked out perfectly. \n\nThe reason I received was that I didn't have as many PRs as the next person, I'm the lowest in that regard and in points completed. We have a minimum rate of 1 point per ticket so people can just spam 1 pointer tickets that take no time so their points are inflated while mine are mostly bigger tickets where 3 points require work. I also got let go for behavior reasons yet she didn't provide a single concrete example.\n\nThe HR guy was sympathetic and he said that my manager dropped the ball and that I should have had chances to catch this. They're at least paying the full notice period and as it happens, my pay ends one day before I start the new job, so I have a few months of paid holiday!\n\nIf I didn't have the next job lined up I would be completely screwed. Word around the office is that the company is cutting headcount and I think this was a case of \"if you beat the data hard enough, it'll tell you what you want to hear\". \n\nThoughts? \n\nThis isn't in the US btw.",

      "text": "I've been writing about the Agile certification industry and what actually ships software, and the most common response I get isn't disagreement. It's some version of \"I agree with all of this but I can't say any of it at work. I need this job.\"\n\nFigured I'd write about that part because it's actually the hardest part. Seeing the dysfunction is easy. Changing it without torching your career is the real skill.\n\nI once nearly got put on a performance plan for suggesting we cut a meeting that everyone on the team privately agreed was useless. The problem wasn't that I was wrong. The problem was I said it in a retro with the person who created the meeting sitting right there. That was a lesson I only needed to learn once.\n\nThe thing that actually works is boring. You measure before you say anything. I spent two sprints tracking every meeting. Duration, number of attendees, decisions made. Put it in a spreadsheet. No opinions, no editorializing, just hours and outcomes. Then I showed it to my manager. Same guy who shut me down three months earlier when I told him sprint planning was theater. He looked at the spreadsheet and said \"huh, we should probably fix this.\" Same message. The spreadsheet didn't threaten his authority. My opinion did.\n\nThe other thing is you never bring it up cold in a group setting. You find one person who agrees with you first. Everyone knows who that person is. It's whoever checks slack during sprint review. You show them the data privately. Now it's two people with a spreadsheet instead of one person with a complaint. At one company I spent three weeks having quiet conversations with senior engineers before I raised anything formally. By the time I brought it up in a team lead meeting, four people in the room already agreed. The conversation wasn't \"Greg thinks standups are broken.\" It was \"several of us have been looking at the data.\" Completely different dynamic.\n\nThe framing matters too. \"Let's eliminate daily standups\" triggers every immune response the org has. \"What if we tried async updates for two sprints and measured deployment frequency before and after\" triggers almost nothing. It's temporary. It's measurable. Nobody has to admit they were wrong. I've used this exact approach to kill sprint planning at one shop, cut standups to twice a week at another, and replace retros with monthly health surveys at a third. The experiment always \"worked\" well enough that nobody wanted to go back. But the entry point was never \"this is broken.\" It was always \"let's try something for two weeks.\"\n\nAnd you have to translate. Engineers talk about efficiency. Your manager cares about delivery risk. The VP cares about cost. \"We spend 22 hours per sprint in meetings\" works on your peers. \"Deploy frequency dropped 30% since we added the third weekly sync\" works on your manager. \"Roughly $280,000 in annual salary going to ceremonies\" works on the executive. Same problem. Three different languages. Most engineers speak engineer to everyone and then wonder why nothing changes.\n\nOne more thing that took me years to learn. If you've tried everything, the data, the allies, the experiments, the right language, and the answer is still no, that's information about the company, not about you. At that point you either accept it or start looking. Both are fine. What isn't fine is staying and resenting it for three years while your work suffers. I've been that person too and it's not worth it.\n\nCurious if others have navigated this. Especially interested in what worked at larger companies where the process has more institutional momentum behind it.",

At the time it was loosely based on the Spotify team and agility models. \n \nQuickly got rid of the off-shore companies. We devoured the 2 year backlog those companies had built up in 4 months. Used a strangler pattern to move logical chunks of functionality. It was a well oiled machine with great velocity without having to work any long hours.

No A-holes. No Architects that aren't part of the implementation teams. Embracing that failure is a learning opportunity. Having management that actually understands technology and agility.

There are some utterly broken processes and yet it took me years to figure out why everyone hates me for trying my best to fix them! \n\nA few things I've also learned:\n\n1. NEVER bring anything up cold. Everyone's first instinct is to always resist change. You have to bring up the issue with people 1:1 first, or spend a few standups circling the problem (but not addressing it yet). You need to plant the seed first and give it some time to grow.\n\n2. One of the most effective ways to make people realize a problem isn't by pointing it out to them, but by raising it as a question to them. Instead of telling someone that their solution won't work because of X, ask them instead \"how do we handle it if we encounter X scenario?\"\n\n3. Never frame anything as anyone's fault (even if it is) if you need their buy-in to change things. Find something, anything else to absorb the blame from them. Blame the process. Say it was a team decision. Claim that it wasn't possible to predict such a thing in advance. You will get less resistance from them when they don't feel they have to defend their decisions.\n\n4. Make you teammates feel supported and/or respected. You'll be able to suggest and implement changes much faster if they trust you.",

A major shift like this is going to wreck people across the board.  Basically, if a ton of people default on student loans all at once because they can't repay them, it makes it harder for the younger generations to secure loans, which has been a primary way the young get higher education.\n\nFinal note: There's a lot of millenial and xennial devs that are at the latest 42 years old.  If the shift happens in the next 5-10 years, there is an entire generation of people stuck in that ugly bit of not being old enough to retire.\n\nSo yeah, people have a right to be worried about their future.",

Your future could be one of famine, war, poverty, and it could all happen easily with no chance you could prevent it. I see no reason why AI existing or not should really change that, and it's something you probably need to spend some time with and think about, rather than your focus on this specific issue. There's no guarantee that things get better, that things stay stable, that you as an individual of the billions of individuals on this planet have some type of right to life, liberty and happiness. If you have it today, use it, but don't try to control it.\n\nSecondly, perhaps your thought of \"This group seems to be shrinking after Opus 4.5 dropped\" is because we've all simply gotten tired of saying it. I've been using AI for three years now. I've been using it at work and personally. I've simply gotten tired of it. Every time I point an agent at a code base and ask for something to be done, I have to change the code. I end up spending so much time going back and forth or modifying sections of code that it's not any different than if I had written it myself, from scratch. I work on critical back end systems. I can imagine that if I was working on stuff that it didn't really matter whether it worked well or not, AI would be much more useful. If that's something you're working on, then the problem was more likely the work rather than the tooling. It was always going to go away.  \n  \nPeople in this forum talk as though we are all similar, but we are not. In this subreddit you could be talking to a junior web dev, a senior PLC programmer, an architect for big data, embedded systems. You could be talking to a person who works at a critical system for a bank or a person who makes a web application for generating selfies. Some people might have jobs that change, some people might not. You can't ever know.\n\nI will end with this. Jobs aren't really jobs. You aren't hired for your expertise, or your skillset, or your resume. You are always hired for two reasons, and two reasons only. You are useful, and you are likeable. If you are useful and likeable, you will always be in demand.",

He outlines **three “rip-cord” traps** that should make readers disengage:\n\n1. **Vibe Reporting**: articles imply a conclusion by *juxtaposing* loosely related facts and quotes while omitting key context—creating a “vibe” (e.g., pairing layoffs with generic AI-job-disruption quotes so readers assume “AI caused the layoffs,” even if it didn’t).\n2. **Mining Digital Ick**: stories cherry-pick weird edge-case demos from “AI wireheads,” focus on how unsettling it is, but skip technical specifics and concrete implications—so the piece mainly manufactures discomfort.\n3. **Faux Astonishment**: especially common in YouTube—everything is framed as insane/terrifying/seismic, producing a constant panic haze without precise claims you can check.",

What you’re feeling is real and valid and a lot of people are right there with you even if they won’t admit it.\n\nBut I want to be straight with you about something. You said when you got your first job you thought you were set for life. That was never true, even before AI. Industries change, companies fold, entire job markets disappear. The idea that any degree or any career is a guaranteed ticket for life is something we all got sold and it was never real. That’s not an AI problem, that’s just how it’s always been.\n\nHere’s what I’d actually suggest. You’re a dev with several years of experience. That means you know how to learn, how to problem solve, how to think logically. Those skills don’t become worthless because AI can write code. If anything they become more valuable because someone still needs to understand what the AI is doing, why it’s wrong, and how to use it properly. The devs who will struggle are the ones who refuse to engage with it. The ones who lean in and learn how to work with it are going to be fine.\n\nBut more importantly, and I mean this genuinely, you need to step back from the doom scrolling. Half the takes on here are from people who don’t know what they’re talking about and the other half are people who are just as scared as you projecting their anxiety as certainty. None of them know what’s going to happen. Nobody does. You’re losing sleep over a future that doesn’t exist yet and might never exist in the way you’re imagining.\n\nGo learn how to use the tools. Get familiar with them. Once you actually understand what AI can and can’t do the fear gets a lot smaller. It’s the uncertainty that’s killing you, not the technology.",

Difference is that I probably wrote 5-10% of our code last year, the rest being architecture and design decisions. The rest of the code was written by AI. I’m getting the same output as I would’ve gotten in a strong team of 2 or even 3 good developers. I have friends employed in META and Google and their internal tools are even better than what I can use myself (Claude code now). \n\nI also suffer from anxiety and I can relate with how you’re feeling. You REALLY need to go to a therapist.  You need to get your sleep in order, start exercising and eating healthy. I know you probably don’t feel like getting out of bed sometimes, but I PROMISE you it will get better. You just got to start working towards managing the anxiety. So therapy, exercise, sleep, human connection. And stop reading stuff that worries you. You already have all the information, whatever you read next won’t make you more prepared. Managing the anxiety will. \n\nYou really need to start taking control of your destiny and accept you can’t control what happens in the outside world. Whether AI replaces all the jobs in the world or not, it’s not within your control. Anxiety gets better once you try and begin to find solutions. A few ideas to take control of your own destiny:\n1. Try to find a job in more traditional businesses. I doubt banks are going to get their software maintained by AI anytime soon. Or military equipment companies. So try to find a job in a sector like this. This will maximize your runway IF what you’re worried about ends up affecting your job. \n2. Do you have an expensive lifestyle? Try to simplify it. Ideally get your monthly burn rate down to what can be covered through other jobs. \n3. Really spend the time changing the physiological things affecting anxiety. Sleep, food, exercise. \n4. Try to get some perspective about your own capabilities . Even if the worst thing happens, you’ll deal with it. You can do it. Becoming a software engineer isn’t easy, you’ve already achieved something that most people are probably not able to. \n\n\nDo you have any savings or investments?",

          "text": "I work with AI regularly at work. You should relax. AI cannot replace a human operator. AI requires a focused context in order to do its very best work as anything broader invites assumptions and unexpected outcomes. I believe this is because AI doesn't actually have the ability to know what it does not know. Now imagine how that will work when people who have ZERO systems knowledge want the AI to be their chief translator of a world they can barely begin to understand. It would take nothing short of AGI.\n\nSecondly, if you fear that there will just be fewer engineers. Then my question is why that didn't happen with all the frameworks and tools we use today. We have optimized development extremely before the era of AI and yet it only led to more demand for software. Software in your TV, software in your car, software on your toaster, and in your wearables.\n\nSoon AI will enable the rapid building of software for your shoes, your gym locker, your dental implants and your dog.\n\nAnd if the barrier to software development were to fall severely, then companies would no longer stay in their lane when it comes to what they build. So every SAAS can become more like Google, with software solutions for broader market demands.\n\nAnd if you think all that is wrong, then consider what a disadvantage it is for companies to shed all these employees who just replaced themselves with AI, as those engineers are now all 1-person companies ready to compete with their former employers if they just license once of these models. The concept of anyone making a huge profit by running away with the bulk of the market share suddenly dwindles in such a world.\n\nAll of this rapid change does not spell the end of our profession, it spells another step up in abstraction for building an even more deeply software integrated world and you are there at the birthplace of this moment.

The story of pretty much all technological innovations is that they improve rapidly at the start, but with enough time, the improvements start to become more diminishing. In other words: every exponential is a sigmoid in disguise. Think about when the first iPhone was released; it was pretty radical in terms of new tech. But how about the 7th iPhone or the 12th iPhone? Not too different from the ones before. The same is going to be the case with AI and LLMs. In fact, I think it's pretty much the case that we're at the beginning of the plateau phase. Training and inferencing LLMs is running into energy limits, data limits, architectural limits and computational limits; on top of all that, any increases in data, compute, etc. are tempered by the fact that neural scaling laws follow an inverse power law which is increasing but concave down. So in due time, we will reach a point where LLMs more or less \"peak\" and by then they will become more normal and less disruptive; and I think we are not too far away from that point. Hope this helps, dude. :)",

A human being has a context window of 24 hours. We need to sleep and process information. We distill past events such that we’re not recalling every conversation about a certain topic. An LLM’s context window is only a couple of million tokens. Essentially as the conversation grows the less precise LLM’s become. The bigger issue is that in order to process that kind of information you’ll need to scale data centers more and more. And that means bigger data centers which means costs start to increase.",

GPT-3 barely came out 3 years ago and the world's perception of what was possible changed.

In this point of time in space you are complaining about AI, you could have easily been complaining about another economic great depression which would have wiped out the remaining jobs anyway and have you fighting for mcdonalds job applications. You have no real control over what happens and you can only control how you react to this. Either make a back up plan to pivot out of the career or ride it out really, everyone is going to be in the same boat if AI does get as good as you say it will. Seek therapy, get medication if you need for sleep and anxiety. Maybe go down the line of becoming less terminally online, doomscrolling less and maybe read a book or two on embracing life uncertainties. Things will happen that you will not like or know the answer to, reading every other idiot's opinion on it such as myself doesn't do any good and won't make whatever has you feeling uneasy disappear from reality.",

This means that both AI and humans were given the same task to complete with the same input information. A failure for AI was considered every time it failed to complete the task; or did not complete the task at least as well as human participants did. Amongst most dominant problems were that AI left part of the tasks incomplete resulting in automatically scoring as a failure. This aligns with what I have also observed.\n\nThe current state of AI seems to be that human produces high quality work products.

You have skills. I wouldn't hire anyone that was just a prompt engineer. I wouldn't trust anyone that couldn't do a proper code review or even the principles of proper development. You likely have those skills and you can understand what the logs are saying as the AI models run. You can steer it in different directions. As these tools change, we'll adapt to them.

I think juniors are gonna get squeezed, but all signs point to things being probably more nuanced. \n\nIBM and Salesforce have already done major personnel reductions and regretted it. It seems many orgs just aren’t hiring as many devs. So in the short term the market is going to suck, for sure. \n\nBut I have opinions on why “something big” is probably bullshit. \n\nMajor enterprise orgs are slow, and AI so far at the enterprise level has had mixed results\n\nWhen you read a job description, does it usually say “tasks”? Nah, it says responsibilities. But this makes sense, do you think many companies are comfortable saying “we are ok with a non-deterministic computer program being responsible for our orgs functionality, product, finances, legal”?\n\nAlso competitive advantage, replacing workers with AI (and replacing is big here, cause giving people AI tools can really improve efficiency and the job itself for the employee) drains a company of its unique (maybe not always great) talent and replace them with basically AI contractors. \n\nNot to mention the comfort level of orgs to basically rent their entire workforce from a saas company. Companies can decide how much they pay for labor, and at a very granular level, AI is tokens baby, whether you ask for the cure to cancer or furry porn, it’s all just tokens. Companies are reliant on the relationship with their vendor. People freak out about vendor lock in with security tools, imagine your whole company. \n\nAlso the data centers, you’re dependent on their uptime and security, I’d imagine in a future with 20% unemployment those buildings would become incredibly flammable. \n\nOr incredibly soft targets for foreign actors. Imagine a hack that takes those data centers down in one region for maybe two days? Failover of course but man the ability to have massive disruption is technoeconomic terrorism (trademark) \n\nLook, things are changing, if your only responsibility is “write code” you’re boned. If your responsibility is “identify problems, customer pain points, cost savings, potential risks…” then lean into that. \n\nOh and I try and say nice things to the toaster JIC.",

Learn about AI, there lies the answer of why software engineering will not go away, but your skill set will definitely have to change, not so different to learn a new language or a new framework...**  \n  \nYou should really study AI, not to \"git gud\" but that would help you understand its limitation\n\nCause it has limitations, unfixable limitations, by design.\n\nAI companies are BLEEDING money madly trying to both, win the AI race (race that is literally unwinnable, AGI is imposible with the current approach) or trying to get enough market share, once things settle, prices will then go stupid high and vibecoding garbage will be punished.\n\nLook at OpenAI sinking, Look how how Anthropic is adjusting and forcing everybody into their closed ecosystem.\n\nTry to run a \"small\" model in your computer..... it takes 64Gb of RAM to run a model equivalent to GPT4 mini.... once the AI companies adjust their prices, private companies will try to run proprietary/open models and quickly figure out that it takes a LOT of money to do it, the software engineering will be the answer for this, not everything has to be AI, deterministic code still has value, it is orders of magnitude cheaper, guess who can trace, plan, design and maybe even manually code these.... yes, software engineers.\n\nNo, you can not fully replace developers the same way you can not replace a builder just because you have 3D printers for buildings, somebody still has to operate those machines.\n\nYes, work will change and yes, a LOT of people will lose their jobs during the adjustment of the market, but eventually the dust will settle and companies will start hiring again, because software at its core is still valuable, it is actually more valuable now that you can use agents to interconnect software tools and it is faster to prototype and deliver small pieces of software and tools.\n\nThings will change, yes, SaaS will probably die as building dedicated systems is now not a completely retarded decision and buying a big product is now harder to justify if you can hire a rockstar engineer that can partner with your domain experts to deliver a highly specialized custom software.  \n  \nBut putting anybody on charge of building the software will lead to disaster, engineering is still needed, not because code reusability and structures are critical (you can argue they are, as the AI codes better when the codebase is better...) but because a system designed badly will fail sooner or later and rebuilding it, even though takes several times less time, still wrecks companies that rely on software to operate, the systems thinking that makes software engineering highly valuable is still there.\n\nSoftware engineers will probably now migrate to integrate into several areas that could not afford software before, \"smaller\" business than can now get a tangible return of investment if they hire a developer, cause a good lone developer can deliver a lot using AI, you don't need a full department anymore, having one or two engineers per company is a great idea these days.\n\nDon't be terrified, if AI is going to replace everybody, somebody has to write all the tools and software needed to do so.... and no, AI can not do it by itself, it needs guidance and a plan, it needs decisions landed on reality and it is as of now, imposible to model reality, no way to process the amount of continuos values produced by .... real life.\n\nOnce AI is able to replace developers, it will literally be able to replace the whole humanity and well.... at that point either money loses all sense, because nobody will work, or we as a species are done anyway.",

I still have to train them and correct them but i'm shipping dozens of things per day - and that is only because my capacity to review the changes is limited by me AND the number of things product needs me to do is limited by their brains.\n\nIf the rate of change from 4.5 to 4.6 continues where the next model ever 2-3 months is an order of magnitude better, i won't need to be in the loop directly in 9-12 months and i will be exclusively on the business and product side, which is ok because i have been leading multiple teams of humans like this for a long time. \n\nI definitely wouldn't want to be a regular engineer right now.

They are often repetitive, superficial, exaggerated, baseless etc. We combat it by removing such posts under Rule #9, which is fine\n\nHowever, it's still very easy to find multiple threads repeating the exact same discussion. One common suggestion is to limit LLM related posts to a megathread. In my opinion megathreads rarely work outside of big events. Doing so would practically mean no more LLM discussion allowed\n\nI do believe LLM discussion is, at the very least, a reality. It's not wise to be a luddite about it. There's real engineering in this field, there are real challenges to experienceddevs and therefore completely banning it isn't an option \n\nTLDR: What you would think if LLM related posts were only allowed on some days? Let's say Tuesday and Thursday. This simultaneously helps with the spam, but also doesn't completely kill the discussion like a megathread",

This tends to be fairly technology agnostic, and a lot of that advice would have been applicable 20 years ago, and will hopefully still be 20 years from now.\n\nCertainly LLMs disrupt how we interact with other colleagues and process changes so it can't just be ignored, but I'd really love to keep it in the super abstract.\n\nWith that said, there are a lot of the same conversations being had on repeat. I for one wouldn't mind limiting the number of posts (if it's easiest to have days of the week, then sure). I do think there is a difference between \"This is how I use it, and wow!\" vs \"I have a junior that relies on AI and I'm concerned in their ability to grow as a developer\".",

This has been my favorite sub for a really long time and the content has certainly diminished since the ai boom. \n\nThat said, I worry you will still run into the same issues; literally no one will pay attention to LLMondays and there will still be daily posts and reposted about \"omg is clawd taking my job?\". And just like now, these posts will inevitably garner lots of attention and discussion, not because the tech is cool or whatever, but because just the topic of ai is incredibly polarizing - topics that are naturally polarizing will always drive huge discussions regardless of the productivity of the discussion. But now because of the new rule you're allowed to close the post freely, pissing off more people because of whatever bias they perceive you for having: \"mods killed the discussion because they're ai lovers/haters\" post will show up more and more. \n\nI hate to give you this feedback without offering suggestions, but like everyone else, I am unsure the best path forward. You could consider the new LLM day rule, while also turning on mod approval on new posts - that way you can snuff them out early. This would require a lot more mod support though (I'm happy to help if I can), but the quality of the content would skyrocket. \n\nRegardless, good luck with whatever decision you make.",

Exercise restraint and [do not eat the marshmallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment).

I had started a bit earlier that day and no one else from my team responded. Since I was already online, I said I would take a look.\n\nWhat I thought would be a quick check turned into two hours of deep diving into logs, tracing code and trying to understand what broke. I finally found the issue and came up with a fix. Because of the pressure and urgency, I skipped full unit testing. We pushed the hot fix, hoping for relief. Instead, it made things worse.\n\nAt that point my heart honestly dropped. We had to roll everything back and start again, this time doing it properly. Even though my superiors were very supportive, it was one of the most stressful days I have had. By the end of it, I was completely drained and just grateful the day was over.\n\nCurious to hear yours. What was the day that really tested you as a developer?",

So while the skydiving instructors are suiting us up and going over instructions and safety, I’m constantly sneaking out my phone to send slack messages trying to calm down my director. \n\nAt some point I realized just how ridiculous this all was, that I was literally about to jump out of a plane and I was far more stressed about my director being mad about this stupid script. I put my phone away finally, vowed to find a new job, and had a ton of fun skydiving. The script ended up finishing in time, and I had a new job 6 weeks later.",

Cause was that when radar is not yet ready, it tries to connect and if it fails, it terminates — basically race condition at boot-up. We had safety procedures in place to not allow autonomous driving and come to a stop when radar data timeouts which never got triggered.\n\nThe procedure interacting with radar driver forwarded latest received radar data with fresh timestamp. It was set on loop according to the expected requirement to send message every 100ms. When driver had update, a buffer was overridden. And when it was time, the buffer was sent out. However, if buffer was filled with old data (or nothing at all), it still got forwarded as \"no obstacles\". Timestamp was supposed to be of the data, not message timestamp.

At no point did I ever feel any pressure to reschedule my surgery or come in anyway, but after having been at home for a few days I was going stir crazy and decided to surprise my colleagues by showing up.\n\nTurns out it was a good thing I did. Not long after we started, we hit an error none of us had ever seen before. My manager was all set to call the vendor’s support when I realized that a) I knew what the problem was, and b) it had likely just fixed itself\\*.   So I said, “Hey, hit “retry”,” it worked, and thus was a long and involved support call that probably would have gone nowhere avoided.\n\n\\* So, the particular thing that failed: one part of our upgrade process was basically “take a backup of the database, fail it over to the hot standby, then do an extra differential backup just in case”.  The first backup worked, the failover worked, the second backup failed. The reason: it was the first time we’d run the process against a database of any appreciable size, and it took a couple of minutes before it became available. We were just trying too fast.",

          "text": "They published full details in status updates publicly so I'm luckily not breaching NDA to talk about this. I was in the Compute team at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure at the time.\n\n\nWe had an incident about 4 years ago, a bug in a log rotation tool kicked in at midnight UTC (late afternoon Pacific Time where I'm based.) I forget what the bug was, or why it fired. I want to say it related to leap day logic, thought it wasn't a leap year.  The bug had been in production for several months, waiting for the right conditions.\n\n\nOn this day, the conditions were right and it triggered. It aggressively failed to rotate the logs, instead emitting error messages so fast as it tried over and over that it filled the disk within 5 minutes. This triggered on every single hypervisor, worldwide, simultaneously.\n\n\nEvery running VM was fine, but no mutation operations could take place (start, stop, reboot, add or remove storage etc), and almost anything else broke, eg there was no way to get onto a hypervisor as ssh couldn't log.  It was quickly diagnosed and became an all hands to deck. I got pulled in to see if I could see a way to automate repairs, while some folks started manual repair efforts, but the level of interaction with the ILOM wasn't practical to script. So we ended up with hundreds of us split up into breakout rooms on zoom, manually repairing as many hypervisors as we could. Once we'd repaired enough hypervisors in a region, we could then use our automated repair stuff to automatically migrate VMs from dead hypervisors onto the healthy hypervisor and then just terminate and reprovision the now empty hypervisor.\n\n\nIt took hours. I coordinated several people in one of the breakout rooms, while also repairing hypervisors myself. I want to say I was doing that from about 7pm until around 3am the next day? It was exhausting.\n\n\nI have one particularly enduring memory from that incident, and that was of our SVP at the time. Most SVPs and senior leadership that I've worked for feel an urge to manage incidents. They want to help fix, but don't have the direct technical capability to do so, so they try to apply what skills they do have, trying to do what they can, while facing down pressures from all around. As a more senior engineer, I'll often find my role in incidents is managing the leadership so engineers are freed to do the mitigation.\n\n\nThis SVP was different. They sat mostly silent on the incident bridge, trusting the engineers to handle the problem. They only interjected to stop conversations that were starting to rabbit hole that we weren't stopping ourselves. While listening in, they were writing notes to ask some incredibly insightful questions post-incident, and also organising all the VPs and senior directors into a rotation to ensure there was fresh leadership available throughout the call.  Once we'd broken off into breakout rooms, they'd come through about every half hour, _and make sure that we were drinking enough water_. Not demanding progress updates or hassling us to move faster, just making sure we were okay ourselves.\n\n\nEventually I'd been coordinating things for so long for my group that my brain was completely fried, and the SVP forced me off the call, over my stubborn protestations that I could handle the remaining workload. In hindsight they made the right call, I was exhausted.  I found out afterwards that at numerous occasions during the incident, they'd biased towards the health and wellbeing of the staff vs potential earlier mitigation time.  Their deliberate choices throughout made sure we had good coverage right throughout both the incident and the following days, and they followed up with every single one of us to make sure we were taking time to recuperate. It was part of a continued pattern of behaviour that meant I would probably choose to walk through a metaphorical fire for them.",

That one time I was working for $BIG_BANK as a new hire in a contractor agency.\n\nWe had a distributed monolith that was supposed to receive messages from vendors and process them and send emails/chat messages about the order status. \n\nWe had a long standing performance issue causing the messages to arrive HOURS later instead of seconds. Nobody was able to understand what could have caused the issue and the project was in serious risk of losing reputation among the users, who were already complaining.\n\nI took a stab at it. Distributed transactions with Atomikos, JMS based communication. Randomly after a while the system just started to fail and rollback 2PC transactions due to timeout.\n\nAfter hours of debugging, there it is. The JMS  queue was getting too full of messages and overflowing the capacity of the queue. Turns out that exchanging dozens of 2MB XML messages was the root cause...\n\nThe just hired newcomer who was barely getting started in the project just solved a problem that not even the lead architect could crack, the project was saved.

The helicopter was in the hangar.  The ship was rolling severely.  It was coming within 2 degrees of the critical angle.  If a ship goes past the critical angle, it doesn't roll back in the opposite direction.\n\nThere are replacement parts in crates mounted on shelves on the side of the hangar.  One of these parts was an auxiliary power unit (APU), a smaller jet engine used to provide air to start the main engines.  The crate was tied to the shelf.  On one ship roll the tie down broke and the APU fell of the shelf and went through the chin bubble of the helicopter.\n\nWe kept written records in folders that had a 2-pronged binding clip at the top.  This will be important later in the story.\n\nBy some miracle, the carrier had a replacement part.  They flew it over to us.  Petty Officer Dugan was assigned to do the repair work.  He brought a chair into the hangar, sat on it, and started removing jagged pieces of plexiglass from the front of the aircraft.  At chow time he left to go eat.  The ship took another roll and the aircraft lifted up on its shock absorbers.  The chair rolled under the aircraft, leg side up.  The ship rolled back and the aircraft settled on the chair punching two holes in the fuselage.\n\nOur aircrewmen maintained the records I mentioned earlier.  They used a two-hole punch to make holes in the records to add them to the binders.  One of the aircrewmen painted DUGAN on the two-hole punch.",

Well, the identities were indeed unique, but unfortunately the identity of the end user making the request was not the identity that made the inter-service call. This was between lambdas and API gateways, so the inter lambda call was assuming a fixed identity within AWS. \n\nIt turns about that if you happened to be the first user to make the request, then your data would get cached and returned to every other user. \n\nThis was in an application that dealt with medical claim data. \n\nThankfully we had feature flagged the caching, so we killed it immediately before any harm was done and fixed it up, but I was certain I would be fired over this. I wasn’t. The post mortem was very respectful and the leadership was more focused on how to prevent this happening again, and all was well for the rest of my time with that company. I am now very very paranoid about caching data, which comes in handy. ",

I have noticed increased number of very unprofessional behaviour from recruiter or hiring managers from well known companies. Here are the examples:\n\n* A recruiter reaches out to me through LinkedIn. We schedule a call. She never shows up. I message her. No response\n* A recruiter reached out to me. We chat and all is well. We schedule a call with HM. He never shows up. I wait for 10 minutes and message a recruiter. Recruiter comes back to me the next day saying that \"something came up for <HM>\". No clear explanation, nothing.\n* First chat with the recruiter. All is well. They sent a Calendly link to pick up time for interviews. Never gotten back to me with confirmation. Follow up emails have been ignored.\n* Recruiter send a Zoom link that has Meeting Password (I think this is how it's called). I cannot get into the call. I email them 5 minutes before the meeting. No response. 15 minutes later I get an email from the recruiter as a separate email with the subject: \"Thank you for your interest\" and body that pretty much says: \"Thanks but no thanks\".\n\nI am genuinely puzzled. Is this just my experience or due to mass layoffs, recruiters lost any sense of professionalism?\n\n  \nEDIT: All of those recruiters have been in-house ones. AKA, they don't represent staffing agencies.",

They choose who they want and don't maintain relationships with the others.\n\nAlso, keep in mind people don't go to school to become a recruiter (usually), its a job they fall into....essentially a sales role. While a blanket statement I know, some recruiters don't treat this job like a career...just the next stop along their way to finding something they actually want to do as a career.\n\nAs for the zoom call + 15 minutes later thanks but no thanks, stuff like that is a by product of working at the whims of a client. Could they have handled it better? sure. I wouldn't take it personal. My guess, the company had an offer out to a candidate...candidate didn't take it yet so they kept the door open to keep looking, candidate comes back and accepts and then they tell the recruiter to cancel all appointments and it was just handled crappily.\n\nEither way, its the nature of the current market, I know plenty of developers who ghosted recruiters mid interview cycle because they got the dream offer while keeping 3 other recruiters on the hook.

I believe this will get worse before it gets better. \n\nGiven the option saving themselves time and hassle without any real consequence for it, many people will opt to do that rather than close the loop and protect a relationship for future reference.

              "text": "Yes and no?\n\nI think it's also that managers and product owners:\n\n- Are generally more prolific writers than programmers, so more articles are penned that talk about programmers being replaced.\n\n- Often resent programmers because they're able to accomplish things the managers and product owners can't (and sometimes the programmers are paid more). \n\n- Fail to understand even the basics of what programmers are doing. They often see it as esoteric typing. I had a manager panic when I came in to work with a cast on my arm, afraid I wouldn't be able to type fast enough. As if my typing speed was why I was the most productive programmer in the office...\n\nSo with that combination of ignorance, attitude, and willingness to express that ignorance online, you see a lot of articles written that talk about how software engineers will be replaced by AI.\n\nFrom the other side, many developers at one time or another have thought about or even tried to build their own products. They've done all the work. So they know exactly how much thought goes into each part.\n\nSome jobs can legit be automated away. I've had \"sprint masters\" on my teams that sit in meetings and read off what's on the sprint board. If every employee is doing their job, then the board is already up to date. The sprint master's only real job is reminding developers to move tickets from one column to another, and that literally could be automated without even adding AI to the equation. On the other side, the sprint master is summarizing the project status to the product owner and manager, which again can be done with a properly designed dashboard. I swear that the only real purpose of the sprint manager was to have an excuse to bill the client for one more consultant. \n\nManagement is harder. They have to deal with interpersonal issues. They have to judge when a team member is pulling their weight. They have to look at the big picture and understand what the goals are. None of this is possible with AI right now. Some management issues can only be addressed by a human, because other humans won't care if they're told the same thing by a computer.\n\nAnd product owners need to understand the product requirements. As a lead developer on a product, I have also taken the role of product owner. I was on one product where the actual product owner had so little understanding of the product requirements that I was effectively doing his job while doing my own. I still wouldn't say that a product owner could be automated away though; it's a necessary role that requires understanding, which LLMs completely lack. It just often isn't a full time role and can be part of the responsibility of the lead developer.",

All the tech managers I've worked with were previously IC's and still do technical work. Not necessarily implementation, but higher level design and reviews, sort of architect adjacent. I'd guess about 1/4 of the product managers I work with were also developers at one point, and quite a few are also technically savvy enough to be competent with SQL and comfortable looking at code if they have questions about how something works. The managers I work with not in a tech department haven't interacted with AI outside of chatgpt.",

AI makes this possible because it handles the tedious parts (boilerplate, test generation, documentation) so the developer has bandwidth to think about the actual problem.\n\nBut here's what people miss: the same thing is happening in reverse. BAs and POs who learn to use AI coding tools effectively can prototype and validate ideas without waiting for a sprint cycle. That doesn't make developers obsolete. It makes the BA more dangerous.\n\nThe roles that are actually at risk are the ones that exist purely as translation layers.

But if you're the person who understands the business domain deeply enough to know which problems are worth solving, that's still incredibly valuable regardless of your title.\n\nThe real shift isn't \"BAs replace devs\" or \"devs replace BAs.\" It's that the people who can do both, understand the problem and build the solution, are going to be disproportionately valuable.",

I \"lead\" a very small team of 4 engineers total.\n\nI consider myself an AI pragmatist as in, I will use AI today in whatever ways it is most effective today but I will not adopt unproven or unsubstantiated patterns in the hopes that \"one day\" they are more effective. I don't believe in \"tooling up\" WRT learning how to use AI now so that I'm an expert 3 years from now. If it's that good, I'll learn it then. That's how I treat 99% of all other tools, I don't replace our testing harness once a quarter just because some CTO claims theirs *will* be better in a few years.\n\nI use AI day to day for developing ideas (like a rubber duck), finding ways to articulate technical concerns in concise ways, quickly spitting out code snippets, passing it a file with a question like \"why isn't X function working\", etc. But I don't bother asking it to solve fully creative problems. I'm *not* anti-AI.\n\nMy company, while not being an AI company, has gone full AI radical. They actively tell engineers that soon they will not be required and they should be embracing AI now so they are not left behind, because soon they will have the same job as PMs - which will both be developing features from the ground up. Like, that's a non-exaggerated paraphrase from the CTO. They fully expect their software company to be developed by non-engineers very soon. They said they expect engineers to stop writing tests, and just having AI do it for us. And so on. They said they are very happy to increase the number of outages & bugs because \"that is just the way of the world now\"\n\nI think that is fundamentally stupid and besides the existential threat to my job / insulting internal discourse, I want to leave *simply* because I fundamentally do not trust the technical leadership anymore. Thinking you can downsize the engineering staff by \\~80% and let PM's and designers run wild will, in my opinion, irreversibly destroy your product within a few years. And I don't want to be here for that.\n\n*Buuuuuuuuuuuut* I have been told by my manager he is prepping the next year of work to hand me a promo in next December. I trust him, I know redditors will tell me it's bait, but I do. I'm performing at L+1 and I know independently from him that my main blocker for promo is just having some visible flashy project.\n\nSo here I am. Stuck for another 1-3 years, watching the company be burnt down from the inside by people giving AI tasks that AI is not yet equipped to solve. Trying to steer the ship towards sanity but merely doing that makes me look like I'm afraid to adopt new tech.",

I wouldn’t stand to let my own work quality slip and let my skills atrophy while the company rakes in short term profits and sets themselves up for long term failure.\n\nYou can’t change leadership, they need to learn the hard way. I really don’t understand it, why would having a machine that puts out infinite slop make you want to lower quality? For me that’s a sign to increase safeguards not drop them.

Absolutely insane value for quick prototypes to get a feeling what it'll look like and find edge cases. Medium sized repo in a non-mainstream language, still pretty good. It'll go through a bunch of files and find the right places very quickly. I use it iteratively most of the time. It'll be confidently incorrect at times so you have to double check. Specific guidance usually allows it to validate and catch itself. Once you have a good idea what you're going to do, make it write a plan and save to file. Then let it implement the change and once again guide it when it gets something not the way you like it. Global preferences of how you want to see the code in the corresponding md also help a lot. Working on changes spanning across multiple repos can get a bit wonky, but you can guide it out of confusion and context blowup with some md persistence. Closing the loop by giving it a compiler and tests is great as it'll fix silly mistakes. Asking it to add logs and debug an issue works some of the time. Pointing it to a CI failure and asking what happened can work surprisingly well. Pasting screenshots asking how to fix works some of the time. The key is in staying critical of what it's doing and working with it iteratively instead of expecting miracles. Sometimes it's absolutely stunning, sometimes it just falls on its face hilariously. Predicting which case it's going to be this time has been challenging.\n\nPS. Funny how y'all are downvoting facts. Good luck 👍",

I don't use any for work, period.\n\nNow what I did is to get informed on the field, how shit works (it helps that I am *very* familiar with ML), what are the limitations etc. In conversations pertaining to LLMs I end up the most knowledgeable about frontier models etc while I myself isn't a user of them.\n\nSo basically what I've been doing is that when I'm consulted, I give early warnings to the relevant engineering people, giving risk assessments to leadership people...and waiting.\n\n>  I want to leave simply because I fundamentally do not trust the technical leadership anymore. Thinking you can downsize the engineering staff by ~80%\n\nI completely understand. Like, a lot of the same, BUT. Leadership will come around. If you put yourself in their shoes, being promised +20% efficiency gains across the board org-wide for the price of a single engineer? Sign me the fk up! Unfortunately it's just all marketing bs so once the experiment will barely kill the company, leadership will come around.\n\nWrt downsizing that is just the stupidest way people understand \"efficiency gains\". It's +20% *per engineer*. If you fire all your engineers you get no gains anymore, duh.\n\n> Buuuuuuuuuuuut I have been told by my manager he is prepping the next year of work to hand me a promo in next December. I trust him, I know redditors will tell me it's bait, but I do. I'm performing at L+1 and I know independently from him that my main blocker for promo is just having some visible flashy project. \n\nJust become leadership. Once you're there they *might* listen to words of caution. But until them, hunker down, and wait.\n\nMy anecdotal experience - I work in distributed E2EE systems - is that literally all of the projects with significant parts written by GenAI fail in some way because the engineers fail to acquire the related domain knowledge that working normally on those things would bring you.

Not a wiki dump, but actual step-by-step walkthroughs with screenshots and decision points. \"If X, do Y. If Z, escalate to this person.\"\n\nThe reason it feels harder to explain than to do is because experienced people have compressed years of context into intuition. They skip steps mentally because they already know the edge cases. When you force them to write it down, they realise half of what they do is undocumented judgment calls.\n\nOne practical approach: pair a new hire with a senior person for a specific process, and make the new hire write the documentation. They'll ask the \"obvious\" questions that nobody else thinks to document, and the senior person fills in the gaps. You end up with docs that actually reflect how things work in practice, not how someone thinks they should work in theory.",

An explanation says \"we do access reviews quarterly.\" A runbook says \"open this Jira board, filter by X, check each row against Y, approve in Z.\" Runbooks are testable - hand one to a new hire and see if they can follow it end to end. If they can't, the runbook is wrong and gets fixed on the spot. Explanations rot silently, runbooks fail loudly.",
