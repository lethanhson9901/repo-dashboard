His most recent take:\n\n“everyone's talking about their teams like they were at the peak of efficiency and bottlenecked by ability to produce code\n\nhere's what things actually look like\n\n\\- your org rarely has good ideas. ideas being expensive to implement was actually helping\n\n\\- majority of workers have no reason to be super motivated, they want to do their 9-5 and get back to their life\n\n\\- they're not using AI to be 10x more effective they're using it to churn out their tasks with less energy spend\n\n\\- the 2 people on your team that actually tried are now flattened by the slop code everyone is producing, they will quit soon\n\n\\- even when you produce work faster you're still bottlenecked by bureaucracy and the dozen other realities of shipping something real\n\n\\- your CFO is like what do you mean each engineer now costs $2000 extra per month in LLM bills”",

What made them so great early on were the constraints, and that is where innovation happened. \n\nA lot of companies given resource constraints really innovate and find themselves concentrated on the biggest bang for their time. When you can quickly build anything you want (abet poorly) you will find there is not enough push back to every question an idea. You end up flooding users with poorly built features and make it harder to do the one thing you were good at.\n\nI could be wrong. Netflix was making slop before AI, people loved doom scrolling social media, Uber’s interface is confusing and awful, and there is a reason why Amazon is filled with cheap items that barely work. Maybe in the end quantity really does matter.",

Back in the 90s and early 00s there were limitations to what you could do on both the technical and artistic side of video games due to the limitations of the hardware. This led to tremendous creativity and a focus on good art direction. This is how you get games like Silent Hill,  Halo, many of the great CRPGs and many many more.\n\nNow with almost no real limitations game design has not only stagnated in the AAA, but has also homogenized in both art direction and feature set. Limitations are the cornerstone of creative solutions. They keep scope under control, and allow the implementation of novel and actually exciting solutions.",

The guy who sent them suggested I could use a curl script to approve them but joked there could be an Easter egg. I told him I wasn’t going to do that and took 40 minutes to confirm every pr. One of them did in fact accidentally have a bunch of code unrelated to the expected change because his local branch was dirty. \n\nTo be clear I don’t blame this mistake on ai. He could have done it with a hand rolled bash script. I blame ai for the fact people don’t double check well enough anymore.",

Your product management group takes that final idea and figures out which dev teams have capacity and skill alignment, and work with your architects to determine constraints and platform options, and then the team's product owner and architect meet with the team. The team locks itself in a room for a half day and knife fights a plan out that will satisfy this refined requirement, and works with the product owner to create the story cards right there. The cards are refined right away, everyone is on the same page, and now that the work is mapped out, a real roadmap can be offered and work can begin.\n\nIt sounds like a lot. It kinda is a lot. But basically one business wants something and product owners and architecture solve constraints that are organization scoped, devs should design right from the start and be the ones making the actual tickets. \n\nBut that's me, and I enjoy my fantasy world. ",

But say your NW is ~$3M and you make 500k$; after taxes, a bay area mortgage, and living expenses, you are maybe left with 150k to save. That is +5% of your NW, and that 5% is getting smaller each year as your NW increases. So you ask yourself, is this endless cycle of OKRs and performance reviews worth your time? The two options are: retire somewhere cheaper, or look for something bigger (either internally in the company, externally at a different company, or start your own thing).\n\nI chose the third option, as a 6-8 month trial.  Climbing the ladder internally at a large company was never pallatable to me.",

              "text": "Personally I'm working at about 50% of my actual ability these days.  Well...maybe 100% of what I think I can handle right now.\n\nI got burnt out during/after Covid.\n\nLaid off in Oct 2024.  Took some time to reflect, realized I was burnt out, decompressed, relaxed, thought about what I wanted to do next.  I had about 11 months off total but still felt like I stayed busy while also taking time to not work or think about work or anything like that.\n\nGot offered a job with a sibling team to the one I had worked with before being laid off and thought \"well it's a job and I know the area and I can provide value\".  It wasn't in the realm of \"what I had thought I wanted to do next\" but it was a job. Skip manager was someone I had worked with and felt they had the right outlook (slow but safe releases, use data to drive changes, etc.), and two of the people on the team I was joining were names I recognized and people I had worked with before.\n\nStarted Sept 2025.  Manager left the team Oct 2025.  Reported to skip manager immediately.  Talked with them about two possible people I knew who would be a great manager.  One wasn't senior enough, but the other interviewed for manager position Nov/Dec 2025 and was basically told they had the job but hiring was frozen.  As far as my work goes, was told I would have a semester (6 months) to work on improving my ownership area.  Ideally (and quite possibly), I thought we could 90% automate the area in that time.  Ownership was shared between me and one of the other people I had worked with before.  Total team size is 8 people, and on-call tasks are business hours only.\n\nEarly December 2025 everyone under my Director (M3) was reorged to another team.  Honestly probably makes sense in the long run for us to be in this org, but additional churn for the team.  This was part of the hiring freeze.\n\nJan 2025 my skip suddenly announced she was leaving (I suspect more of a \"there's no position for you here anymore, we will help you find something else\").  Bonus: the other two people I had worked with before were basically told the same thing.  My team of 8 now has 2 people finding new positions, and 6 people split between 2 other managers.  Myself (Senior), a SWE2, and a SWE1 are moved to one of these managers.  I take ownership of my area (which was also the main on-call focus of my old team) to the new team.\n\nNew team decides our back-up on-call person will handle what our old team's primary on-call handled (business hours only).  New team's primary on-call is 24-hours with a fair amount of tickets coming in each week, though we have 12 or 14 people or so now so it is less frequent.\n\nHowever.....now instead of 2 people working on my area, it's just me, and now the new manager wants us to automate it ASAP instead of over the next semester so there is less work for the back-up on-call person to do.\n\nSo....now I have to do the work of two people, as a single person, in less time, with more on-call work.  We lost the subject matter experts (I'm still ramping up / learning as much as I can, and I guess I'm the SME now), and the new team members don't always know how to do the back-up on-call work that was primary work for my previous team (even though we did a training session and recorded videos), so I'm essentially randomized with the same things every week.  My manager wants me to \"figure out how to solve that\" while also ramping up on the new team's on-call areas so when it's my turn to be primary I'll know what to do.\n\nToday I got pinged that one of my sprint story items was \"added to the list of accomplishments we're talking about tomorrow so make sure to finish it this sprint\" when I haven't even started it with all the other randomizations that have come up.  I think it will be doable before Friday but I guess I'm dropping the other stuff they said they wanted done by the end of the sprint.\n\nIt's frustrating because today when an incident came up and I got pulled into it (more of a \"is your ownership area the problem?\" kind of thing), I apparently was the only person who just dove into the code and started searching for the API name to see where the server code hosted and the client code called it to figure out how it all worked.  I was the only one to share my screen and say \"hey this is what I've uncovered\".... like more and more and see junior engineers (and honestly other senior engineer peers) unable or unwilling to just search and read code and understand?  So I know I'm providing value but also feel like due to the impossible deadlines that are being set, I won't be successful in this position.\n\nThis weekend was a long weekend and I was fine Sat and Sun, but on Mon I started to think about work and how I was going to accomplish everything with the recent org changes / layoffs, and I realized fuck it.  I'll put in my regular work day, and if it gets to a point where I'd rather leave than deal with it, I'll just leave.  Somehow I'm the SME of an area after ~5.5 months because of layoffs and still feel like I'm onboarding (I don't know what I don't know), so fuck them if they ask too much of me.",

It didn’t sound like him at all. \n\nMostly, I’m just disappointed, and that disappointment is affecting my care for the job. I’m essentially being told “we trust ai over you, unless ai gets it wrong, in which case it’s your fault and you’ll be expected to fix the issue in the time frame we expect ai to get it done.” I also feel like I can’t trust my developer colleagues’ work, because so far, their code has bitten me in the ass at least once a week. \n\nIt’s not fun ",

It doesn't make sense in most game development workflows right now.\n\nLooking through this thread, I see that the seasonal LLM FOMO is getting into too many people's heads once again. This hysteria got boring the last 4 times it spiked on Reddit. I have yet to see anything resembling a shift in this industry that isn't being unsustainably enforced by the more gullible types of managerial roles who have never solved software problems and think that they can reshape the hard and unscalable reality of development by screaming loud enough & firing enough people. A story as old as time.\n\nSpoiler, it hasn't and it won't. The pendulum will swing, the tech will reach an equillibrium, and agents will marginally supplement existing workflows in a minority of scenarios where they make sense, but most workflows will remain the same. There are too many matured, stable foundations in development workflows for something like this to come along and compete with the existing way software is created right now.\n\nI would hire a junior dev over artifically forcing agentic Claude Opus usage on my team any day of the week. We're ahead of competitors despite not shoehorning agents into our workflows, trying to force agents into our workflows would set us back in most cases.\n\nIt's not useless but it's also not an industry reshaping change. You all need to get real. When you've been in the game for a decade or longer, you begin to see through these engineering tool S-curve hype cycles which invariably fall a mile short of their promises, it gets boring.",

I have a few remote contractors helping me. My prior roles range from lead eng - to - director/EM.\n\nMy mood: fluctuating daily/weekly between fear and excitement. \n\nFears my career now has a short shelf life, or that we as devs will be relegated to glorified QA testers, or that a sufficiently knowledge PM needs no devs or designers at all, potential downward pressure on comp, and less jobs with more people fighting for them. Fears of being left behind because AI dev tools and practices are moving faster than I can keep up. Fears for society at large.\n\nExcitement because I can learn this new, interesting tool and try to optimize it. I’m excited about it unlike any coding thing I’ve learned in a while. It writes code better than my Vietnam contractors, and the designs are automatically better looking, and I can iterate with it very tightly. It feels so fresh and new. I’m excited about optimizing it and my workflow. And I believe there is an opportunity to individually capitalize on.\n\nAbout remote: I work on site 5 days its just me and the CEO in office. I worked remote Monday though because the office was closed. Admittedly I was watching movies or even playing Minecraft while letting Claude work for me and that was pretty nice (yeah I admit I was a bit lazy that day). It was a really novel experience. I goofed around but still actually got a lot done and made real progress on my project because of Claude. I think this checked out approach may be realistic in some types of jobs with lower expectations. Especially those behind the times. Thinking Midwest or not tech-first companies. But if you work in a high-paying job, or at early stage startup or in the Bay Area the expectations for productivity are going to 5-10x.",

I still very much do a lot of coding until I understand a repo enough to where I feel confident just reviewing the code, but I still have Claude do a bunch of stuff to make user stories go faster. \n\nAnyone who is strictly AI only yeah they tend to forget how the repo is structured and is harder to get them up to speed if there an emergency fix needed. \n\nWe are expanding and well funded in paper, but because of my past anytime I see expansion its more of a when they will start to downsize and am I safe or not. \n\nMood is even.

You will get more out of inviting the interviewer into the exercise - it doesn't take much - \"what do you think of this/that?\" \"I could do ABC or XYZ, do you have a preference?\".

Last year I blanked on how to reverse a string during a live coding round and I literally wrote a distributed event processing system the week before. The worst part is knowing you know it, feeling your brain refuse to cooperate, and watching the interviewer's expression shift from \"let's see what they've got\" to \"oh.\"\n\n\n\nThe thing that actually helped me wasn't practice problems or breathing exercises. It was reframing what \"watching me code\" means. In a real pair programming session, the other person is a collaborator. In an interview, they're an evaluator. Your brain knows the difference even if you tell it otherwise, and the evaluator context triggers the exact same fight-or-flight as public speaking. So I started treating every interview coding session like I'm explaining my thought process to a junior dev. Narrate everything out loud. \"Ok, I need to iterate through this, and I'm thinking about edge cases like empty input...\" It sounds awkward but it actually slows down the panic spiral because you're engaging the verbal part of your brain which competes with the anxiety loop.\n\n\n\nAlso, fwiw, the interviewers who are good at their job know this happens. The ones who judge you for freezing on a switch statement after seeing your system design are just bad interviewers. Can't fix that part.",

Especially if the interview or changing the job is a life-changing event. The body enables the so-called fight-or-flight response which (significantly) reduces the cognitive abilities. The high level of cortisol is to blame (as a matter of fact it could be measured to confirm).\n\nHow to mitigate? There are plenty advices when searching \"how to reduce fight-or-flight response\" and \"how to mitigate imposter syndrome\", but hard to say which is most suitable for a specific person. Food and drink might affect the hormones, as well as the other sources of stress. Some people advise to tell about it to the interviewer, some companies could give the offline homework instead of the live coding.\n\nInterview practice matters, of course. But sometimes, people don't have the right focus. Certain things needs to be repeated many times to be automated, cached, because stress hormones worsens the recall. It is typical, that people use the approach when something is done, it can be forgotten. With the leetcode and similar this approach is terrible. People solve hundreds of problems, but they forget most of them soon, or it resides in a place in memory they cannot reach during the interview. It's good to roughly know the area or possible tasks and practice them multiple times. \n\nI have the same issue and I find it hard to overcome. I tried the advice about imposter. I know people who did the same and progressed much better than I. I think I became better at things like public speeches, but the interview paralyzing doesn't want to disappear. ",

I've answered hard questions properly and still didn't pass interviews, I felt that I bombed interviews and yet still I passed them.\n\nI was a team lead for a few years and I got to interview people quite a bit, and let me tell you, the interviewer is as much of a factor in this as you are.\n\nIt takes effort and time to set up an interview pipeline, what are the right questions to ask? How do I gauge your skill? Do I have alternative questions in case I land on something you're not very good at, but perhaps you have something else that is better? How do I sprinkle you the right hints and how do I test whether you're good at communicating? It's an insanely fucking hard job, and like any job, the skill of the interviewer and the effort put in the pipeline is a huge factor.\n\nYou could be a genius engineer, but if a shitty interview pipeline only asks leetcode hards, and only measures you whether you pass all tests in 60 minutes, is that really a good filter? Does that even say anything about you other than you know how to code leetcode?\n\nDon't take it personally, a lot of companies are shit at interviewing, and revel the fact that you might just work for their competitor instead and drive them out of business. If you're good at what you do, then you will game their systems or stumble on a company with a better engineering culture.\n\nAnd even if the pipeline is good and the interviewer is skilled, there are other factors, such as not needing someone exactly of your profile/skillset at the moment, or not really having chemistry with the interviewer, or they simply not liking the look of your eyelashes. You can't control any of these things, except the eyelash part, but since we're developers, we are doomed to a life of somewhat un-attractiveness anyway.\n\nTake the L, give them the finger for being too stupid to see the brilliance of [TheTopG\\_\\_\\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTopG___/), and move on to the next one.",

Anyways they didn't ask me any coding questions for a Senior SWE role.  It was behavioral type questions learning about how I operate day to day along with technical type conversations.\n\nI guess they assumed my 15 YOE was good enough to verify my coding skills.  Anyways I grew suspect of the company since the 4 interviews were basically just conversations.  The people that interviewed me were all from big tech companies like Waymo, Apple, and Google looking at their LinkedIn page.\n\nMany employees graduated from Stanford and other big named schools.  Yet here I was graduated from some no-name state school working at private no-name non-tech companies in non-tech cities on the east coast.  The recruiter randomly found me on LinkedIn and that was how I heard about this company.\n\nThe quoted salary range from the in house recruiter was something like 175K - 210K.  I guess they liked me so much that their initial offer was for 225K.  The problem is I couldn't shake the nagging feeling the lack of technical coding questions was a red flag.\n\nAnyways I turned down the offer.  Since then this company has had a series A in 2024 and a series B in 2025 for 100 million.  It grew from about 30 employees in 2023 to, according to LinkedIn, over 100 employees today.\n\nAnyways I didn't have a strong point to this story.  It was just an anecdote I thought of as you said you don't do Leetcode interviews and I thought that was a red flag for some company I interviewed at years ago. Obviously I was wrong, lol.",

They are often at the dentist or had to go pick the daughter. Their definition of work is booking meetings and literally have someone start some podcast nonsense; sometimes you catch them not able to answer questions because they are not listening during their pointless meetings. These are the people interviewing! I started creating technical videos to showcase work for solutions provide to things the never had or imagine having, then suddenly everyone has an opinion and start throwing jargon which they seem to understand at surface level but not deep enough, as in practice what the claim have done doesn’t work as they think. I show them data, graphics, performance, benchmark examples wasting my time, they don’t even check. Eventually the manager complain the are taking too long to approve PR and there’s no actionable feedback and these losers approve. Zero chances since weeks! Then complain there are too may PR to review that depend on each other. Or, that the experimental library release is way ahead to the actual “latest” version. Without realising that they are the gatekeepers. Absolute garbage people!",

Took me about 2.5 years — I was a bit picky with companies and still had a job, so I wasn't going that hard, but it still felt like a marathon. A lot of big whiffs, a lot of interviews where I came up with the perfect answer the instant I hung up the call. Nothing to do but iterate and repeat.\n\nOne thought from reading your story here: have questions prepared in advance. You should be curious about the place where you're going to work. You should have a couple questions in the back pocket that you'll ask everyone, and then at least 1-2 about the specific company you're applying to.\n\nHave a good rest, watch some braindead comedy, and then back at it tomorrow.",

They’re generally helpful with generating CLI commands for tools I’m not familiar with, small SQL queries, or code snippets for languages I’m less familiar with. I’ve even found them to be pretty helpful with generating simpler one file scripts (pulling data from S3, decoding, doing some basic filtering, etc) that have been pretty helpful and maybe saved 2-3 hours of time for a single use case. Even when generating basic web front ends, it’s pretty decent for handling inputs, adding some basic functionality, and doing some output formatting. Basic stuff that maybe saves me a day for generating a really small and basic internal tool that won’t be further worked on.\n\nBut agentic work for anything complicated? Unless it’s an incredibly small and well focused prompt, I don’t see it working that well. Even then, it’s normally faster to just make the change myself.\n\nFor design documents it’s helpful with catching grammatical issues. Writing the document itself is pretty fast but the document itself makes no sense. Reading an LLM-heavy document is unbearable. They’re generally very sloppy very quickly and it’s so much less clear what the author actually wants. I’d rather read your poorly written design document that was written by hand than an LLM document. \n\nWhenever I go on Twitter/X or social media I see the complete opposite. Companies that aren’t writing any code themselves but instead with Claude/Codex. People that are PMs who just create tickets and PRs get submitted and merged almost immediately. Everyone says SWE will just be code reviewers and make architectural decisions in 1-3 years until LLMs get to the point where they are pseudo deterministic to the point where they are significantly more accurate than humans. Claude Code is supposedly written entirely with the Claude Code itself.\n\nEven in big tech I see some Senior SWEs say that they are 2-3x more productive with Claude Code or other agentic IDEs. I’ve seen Principal Engineers probably pushing 5-700k+ in compensation pushing for prompt driven development to be applied at wide scale or we’ll be left behind and outdated soon. That in the last few months, these LLMs have gotten so much better than in the past and are incredibly capable. That we can deliver 2-3x more if we fully embrace AI-native. Product managers or software managers expecting faster timelines too. Where is this productivity coming from?\n\nI truly don’t understand it. Is it completely fraud and a marketing scheme? One of the principal engineers gave a presentation on agentic development with the primary example being that they entirely developed their own to do list application with prompts exclusively.\n\nI get so much anxiety reading social media and AI reports. It seems like software engineers will be largely extinct in a few years. But then I try to work with these tools and can’t understand what everyone is saying.",

Any database product they had was relational! Just ask the salesperson; you know salespeople never lie.

The paper is referred to as “Codd’s Twelve Rules” or sometimes as “Codd’s Twelve Commandments”, despite the fact there were actually 13 of them because the numbering started with zero.

Even with a test/CI/linter harness feedback loop, it only converges on something reasonable when I give it very detailed instructions.\n\nIt does do refactoring amazingly fast but I have to refactor sooo much *because* I'm using it.

But pretty equivalent-ish in that slice.\n\nAnd yea, you really have to stay on top of it. I haven't noticed many straight up logic bugs, but the real problematic ones are when there's any ambiguity around some instruction, it's still going to silently \"guess\" what you meant, and fuck up the business logic.\n\nI'd say with Opus, compared to Sonnet 4.1 (model I used before), it's gone from happening 80% of the time, to happening like 20% of the time, since it's just way better at deciding when to get more context and crunching it. It's still an issue, but a manageable enough one now.\n\nI'm really not sure how much of a time saver it is or isn't yet, tbh. There's been a lot of \"encouragement\" to, ya know, leverage AI and all that, so I really just decided to give it another earnest shot only in the last week or so, so I've definitely spent more time exploring and setting up (modern, detailed agent instructions, setting up mcps, etc) than building stuff, but I've done a few bug fixes, and a couple \"greenfield-ish\"/bolt-on type feature pieces as I've gone along, and it's pretty effective. \n\nI work on a lot of across the stack feature dev on a large consumer mobile app. I've been putting together a kind of monorepo that has our React Native repo, our application server repo, the repo with our gRPC client and host, and the repo with use to deploy our DB schema/profs. Basically everything you need to build a new feature in the app. I told it I wanted to work on setting up agent instructions, then spent a bunch of just explaining how everything works, what is responsible for what, and a process for how it should work (for example, it can't connect to our QA database, so I told it \"when we make changes to the Database project, write a copy of the new table/proc\" to a TODO/ folder, so I can copy it and run it myself\").\n\nAnyway, we have \"message inbox\" screen in the app that doesn't get a lot of love, so I picked up an old ticket where we want to add a way for users to delete and also undelete messages (archive, really). Not huge, but it requires a new button in the app, new settings option, small screen listing archived messages, a net new endpoint in the server, new args and logic in 2 others, protobuf updates, new proc, DB index ups, new table field...it was a lot of little stuff, across a lot of layers, and our codebase is not a particularly hygienic one....and this little terminal clanker bitch talked to itself for about 10 minutes, read some shit, wrote a bunch of stuff, and ended up with something that was not quite fully working, but only a couple tweaks away from it, and pretty much production quality code..overall, not too different how I would have written it. It followed the instructions I laid out, and after a couple back and forth (maybe 5 messages, over 30 minutes), it was up and running in QA.\n\nI feel like that particular one was pretty in its wheelhouse, since it was pretty simple to convey the full set of requirements, but it was impressive. I know the perception study, and I know I'm not above my own biases, so I'm not going to conclude it's way fast or not for a while, but damn it kinda felt like (for the first time I've experience with an LLM)",

Matching your requirements against the logic, and making sure that your code really meets what you *should* be doing in a way that's going to also meet future requirements is whats hard, and kills projects. When you're dealing with large application's, that's very tricky\n\nI suspect that initially people get very hyped because you've suddenly got a tool that can generate code, which can and will solve problems. But its not helping with the stuff that's actually *hard* about software engineering, because it inherently can't design a custom system for something with how these tools work. It can't get you to understand what's actually happening, and the more you vibe code - the more you distance yourself from understanding the code - which is directly counterproductive in the long term. The nightmare situation for any software project is when you've completely lost track of the architecture, and its all spaghetti\n\nWe've gone through several cycles of people being incredibly excited for these tools, and then pulling back again when they realise that writing any old code that works in an isolated context is not the challenging part. I could crack out a basic app in a short space of time that solves a problem (and I have done many times, especially if you permit plagiarism), but making something that can be built on and last is what's hard\n\nEdit:\n\nMost people in this sub are also extremely junior despite the name",

But even that has allowed me to get so much more done so quickly. It's really a matter of giving myself the time to get comfortable with the workflows and developing a good intuition for what works and what doesn't. Steve Yegge's [stages](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04) are a pretty good mental model for thinking about this. I'd say I'm squarely in stage 5 myself.\n\nThere are easy things you should always do, like creating a CLAUDE.md file and/or an AGENTS.md file, agent skills in the form SKILL.md, and being very liberal about having the agent create new skills for itself whenever it manages to nail down a workflow, [subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) for roles and context management. I've also found that having it create a scratchpad for itself where it will write down any important findings or insights that it discovers in the course of trying to solve a problem helps a lot with agent handoff and context compaction.\n\nOn the harness side of things, the fact that it's running in an agentic loop rather than a chat interface already gives you a really good starting point, and the way you extend that is going to depend on the nature of what you work on. To give an example: I had some JSON files that followed a schema that I needed to migrate over to a newer version. Rather than have the agent try to do the conversion itself, I just had it look at the two schemas and write me a schema migration script. And then it just calls the script. Or I might need it to make some API calls and figure out some kind of workflow. I don't want it to have figure out the workflow and make the API calls itself every time, so I have it write me a deterministic script that makes the API calls, and then it just runs the script. Or I might need to do a bunch of math or graph processing. I don't trust it to do math, so what do I do? You guessed it: write me a script that uses a specialized math or graph theory library, and have it run that every time. And it can adapt the script in response to edge cases that it might encounter or evolving requirements. And it just gets better and better at working in the environment you've built for it because it can encode the domain knowledge it's learned in the artifacts that it's produced for itself (the scripts, the scratchpad, etc.), so a new agent doesn't have to rebuild all of that context from scratch.\n\nThere's at least three modes of agentic loops that I've seen people experiment with: there's the script/CLI-driven loop (what I've been talking about thus far); the functional/service contract loop (using something like [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) to encapsulate the functionality you want to give it in tightly-scoped functions with typing and validation), and there's the MCP approach.\n\nThe latter two are conceptually elegant because they look a lot like how you do good software development. But then you try the script/CLI approach and you realize it's much more powerful because it can just write software to better enable it to do things that it couldn't do, and it almost starts to look like recursive self-improvement (at the agent level, not the model level, of course).",

Or when there is an overlap in domains, for example ray tracing for scientific visualization vs for computer graphics, it is completely impossible to get the LLM to focus on the correct context. The bigger training corpus from industry completely pollutes the output. \n\nTo your point though, I think this is why a lot of their math heavy code output is junk. Most math heavy code in the training data is written by mathematicians or physicists who can't code. It sucks. I know math and physics and I can code, and I have higher standards.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I use LLMs all the time. They're great for one-shot scripts, for interpolating and generating documentation, and useful rubber ducks for debugging. They're even excellent assistants for mathematical proofs and derivations.

It's impressive.\n\n**B**: When I work with it on projects which are very specific, with bespoke business rules, or require integrating into a massive existing codebase, then it needs **a lot** of hand-holding. The context window degrades, it gets sloppy, and it's frustrating. \n\nThis aligns with how the LLM was trained. It interpolates standard patterns well; it cannot extrapolate complex, unseen business logic.\n\nSo why the massive disconnect between your experience and what you see on social media? \n\n1. **Engagement Farming:** Twitter/X and LinkedIn heavily reward extreme claims. \"AI is replacing us\" gets clicks; \"AI saved me 45 minutes on a regex script\" does not.\n2. **Greenfield vs. Legacy:** When a Principal Engineer builds a \"to-do list application entirely with prompts,\" they are building a greenfield project in a vacuum (Scenario A). When you try to use an agent to fix a bug in a 10-year-old enterprise monolith, you are fighting rigid integration constraints (Scenario B). \n3. **Measuring the Wrong Thing:** Generating code is fast. Integrating, debugging, and maintaining that code in a bespoke environment is slow. The \"2-3x productivity\" claims usually measure the former and ignore the latter.\n\nWhich means that for your own sanity and workflow:\n\n* break up a project in mini-projects falling in either scenario A or B (though keep in mind, the cognitive load of perfectly isolating a task so the LLM can understand it sometimes takes longer than just writing it yourself).\n* use LLM for scenario A problems for big impact.\n* use LLM for autocomplete-type of support for scenario B problems.\n* add scenario **C**: use LLM for code-adjacent tasks (like generating CLI commands, formatting data, or catching grammar in docs) to win additional time.\n\nYou aren't missing anything.

But that is what we are competing with. Go up one level to an app that services 3,000 employees, the Base 44 slop done by some department manager still has value. They have domain knowledge that we don't. They know how their co-workers and siloes work and their workflow.\n\nSo we are basically competing with that. And  we know it. I recently worked on one od those 4 developer $600k projects scoped for 4 months of engineering. And we are just replicating the POC/MVP that was built.\n\nIn fact, it is better than any Figma I've used. We know what they want and those sloppy MVC teaches us the business domain and illustrate way better than any Jira story write up. One day, some day, those POCs will be it. Right now, they are 80-90% good enough. We just have the last mile , last 10% advantage. I am honeslty fine with it. My whole team knows that. \"We are competing against people using AI\"\n\nI am glad this is happening as it exposes the wasteful projects done in the past that costed millions and millions to develop and maintain when we could of either bought it off the shelf. Or minimized resources just to build \"Just enough\" without the traditional over-complexity. If someone cost $150 an hour and spends 4 weeks to do some front end responsive scaling and sprinkle some random layout, is that effort worth $24,000 for that user story? When it is used by two people maybe twice every 2 years? When a now-code automation does it with 2 clicks? Then it is thrown out 6 months later because design fancies something else, a different layout. Do that three times a year, the org is wasting close to 100K on what? A button click that is hardly ever used by no one?\n\nI rather focus on the last mile, the last 10% value type projects. As those work will always be harder to replace by LLMs. Some devs have blinders. But when I dissect user stories and ask, is that worth worth $60,000? Wouldn't the company be better served with buying a license for a COTs system that cost $200? So this is a shakedown to expose these ROI value propositions. I hope more engineers see that.",

Some of the shit I saw during the beginning of my career would never exist with today's LLMs, simply because they would pump out OK code, no matter how mediocre the dev. \n\nNow, will they CHANGE the world? I'm not sure. The way I see it, it all hinges on whether or not AI can review its own code. From a programming point of view, it can use tests as a guidelines for \"fixing\" things, so it could be a helpful tool to fix bugs, but I believe it still can't understand intent that well, as in the intent behind a feature, or if a PR is good or not.\n\nSo Unless you're at a startup where pumping out code is more important than it working, or it bringing value, I don't see humans being taken away from the equation, and I would go out on a limb and say that any perceived gain of productivity is squashed by the gigantic amounts of code LLMs can pump out. Now, you can't ask a software engineer to squeeze out more brain juice, so my only logical conclusion is, now we spend whatever gained time reading code and correcting/iterating on generated code. Are we more productive? It's not really important. The bottleneck is still mental energy, and LLMs aren't giving us any.\n\nIt's a weird state of things right now. LLMs as of now are just a way to squeeze us out more. Give a little bit of convenience when generating code and in return being asked to take 10X the mental load just because. Non technical people don't understand. They think writing the code is the hard part, and touting LLMs to be such a revolutionary technology is political suicide for any SWE. Is giving in to the new expectations, new expectations where you're supposed to deliver a lot more at the same salary. \n\nOn my end, I embrace AI. It's okay, for the most part. It makes a lot of tedious shit easier, and reduces friction in a lot of places!!! But it isn't taking my job away. And it's important that people temper their expectations of it.

Because the majority of training data is JavaScript already and because the tasks in that domain are text-in text-out. Contrast that to game development where you are using C++ and Lua. Not as much training data and not everything is text, all assets are binary. Some games in Unreal Engine are entirely created with Blueprints. It's bad enough it's a binary file, but it's even created via an editor, not text (unlike a database, which is text-in binary-out).\n\nBut yes, I can't wait for the hype to die out and everyone is on the same page as to how and when to use LLMs.",

The gap between what some of us are doing with ai and what others are doing is massive - which is the whole point of OP’s post I guess. \n\nThe comments agreeing with OP appear to not be using the most recent tools and workflows. Claude code with Opus with plugins, skills, sub-agents, and use of markdown files for instructions, documentation, and guardrails.  Even OP is saying they haven’t actually tried Claude Code. How can you evaluate the efficacy of a method if you’re not actually testing it? \n\nWe went from a team of 5 to a team of 3 (no layoffs, people left for other reasons, and we haven’t replaced them). Same amount of work, same clients, better code quality. Every codebase has markdown files. If anything, my code reviews are more, not less comprehensive now, and I feel more, not less, confident in our deliverables. \n\nNothing is being shipped that I haven’t read, or that I couldn’t write myself, or that is “slop”. It’s a mystery to me where these “5000 line pull-requests that no one can read or debug” come from. If you have any standards or rules at all, a PR like that never happens in the first place, ai or not. \n\nIt’s a fact (we have the data) that our team is closing 2x the number of tickets per week that we closed last year in the same amount of time, with 2/3 the staff.  It’s my anecdotal observation that our code quality has improved (though some of you won’t be able to accept that).\n\nWe gained velocity and replaced two entire engineer salaries with 3 Claude Code 20x max subscriptions and a week of onboarding for the team to the most recent tooling and techniques.\n\nSome things in this space are hype and some things are real, and you won’t know which is which if you don’t commit to learning.",

I don’t just want to grind tickets and hope it happens.\n\nWith AI tools getting better and better, it feels like just knowing syntax or cranking out code isn’t really what separates junior from senior anymore. I’m guessing the bigger differences are around system design, making good trade-offs, writing code that actually lasts, and understanding the bigger picture of what you’re building.\n\nI mainly work in Java, but I’m open to anything, be it language-agnostic books, architecture, distributed systems, mindset stuff, whatever made a difference for you.\n\nI’ve seen these recommended a lot:\n\n\\- Designing Data-Intensive Applications\n\n\\- The Pragmatic Programmer\n\n\\- Effective Java\n\nWhat books actually changed how you think as an engineer?\n\nThanks 🙏",

Much of it is a bit obsolete with newer versions of ES but it's staggering how many engineers I know who don't understand prototypal inheritance and how powerful it can be.

The books only go so far - and you've got the general stack covered here already.\n\nIf it's the former - learn to organize things that take up your time, focus on being able to communicate in terms your stakeholders understand and start doing the senior engineer job at YOUR company. If nothing else, sit with your manager and talk about identifying your current gaps as well as taking things off their plate.\n\nIf you want to be senior engineer by \"measure\", I have a slightly different opinion : learn by changing jobs. I genuinely think it's a time-driven thing apart from there being a natural talent ceiling. What that means is, senior engineers own a different share of different problems depending on the org you're at.\n\nWhat stays consistent is being able to communicate outcomes, risks, and owning deliveries at THAT org. Quit fighting with the non tech stakeholders and start learning how to communicate with them, so there is great social and political capital being built. Understand what they mean when they expect something out of you, and slowly build the trust/ their learning to help them understand what you mean. Back your team's concerns in the way the stakeholders understand, and take the heat when they don't.\n\nSpend a couple years hopping between two or more orgs (where you consistently deliver over 2 years or so). Within the next three-five years you should get there. Good luck!",

      "text": "Forgive me, I'm in a bit of a chicken or the egg situation with my mental health and I'm unsure at this point what is sensible and what is me overreacting.\n\nContext: I've 11 years of experience and worked my way up to a Staff SWE position in my current company. Long story short, I did a lot \"fake it until you make it\" to work my way up because I sought more compensation for a more comfortable life, and better employability, staying ahead of the curve. Especially as remote positions became the norm.\n\nAnyway, I think I overextended by convincing myself (let alone others) that I wanted to be staff level. It's been a couple years now, so I've noticed what has and hasn't improved. I know imposter syndrome is a thing, but it's less about capability and more about enjoyment and consistency. When I first pursued the promotion I was aware of some of my shortcomings and thought I'd work through them. My social battery is small. If I'm real, my ability to act like the adult in the room is limited. I cannot pretend to care about my company anymore. Lots of these things feel like facets of my personality and not skills to develop (I know I can fake some of them, it just drains me).\n\nI can afford a cut. I just don't know what that does for my career prospects. I feel damned if I do, damned if I don't. Other companies have their own expectations of staff level, and I feel like my company's standards are lower, and my organization's specifically are lower still. So when I do apply to other positions, I'm often looking for senior positions since I can often find similar pay estimates and my qualifications line up better, but previous attempts fell through. Job searching is demoralizing so I'm back to trying to make it work better at my current employer.\n\nHow does it come off on a resume to go from staff to senior, especially at the same company? Or should I try to rewrite history and claim I was never staff in the first place? Do I own it and explain why I sought demotion? Or maybe do I just get over myself and press on? Thanks in advance for any advice.\n\nedit: additional context\n\nedit: Thanks everyone for your responses! For posterity, this is what I compiled:\n\ntl;dr: Address burnout, then come back to the question of demotion. Chances are it'd be better to switch positions and not worry about the title.\n\nI wanted to keep my post reasonably concise so I left out a lot of context I didn't think was important. I probably could've clarified a few more things such as what exact responsibilities I have in my current role. Ah well, doesn't matter now.\n\nThe one extra bit I'll add which I'm sure people could pick up on is that I'm undiagnosed but very likely neurospicy. Even in SWE the level of masking I have to do is a constant drain. Interviews especially. When I say \"fake it\" I didn't just mean competency but, like, being human about some things and professional about others. Pretending to care about various things. Who knows, maybe that's all part of the imposter syndrome too. \n\nI found it curious how different everyone's experiences were and how that shaped their responses. e.g. It seemed like a death sentence to ask for demotions with their own employers.\n\nThe titles are indeed arbitrary. I probably don't need to overthink this as far as switching titles between employers. \n\nThe elephant in the room is this sounds a lot like burnout, which is fair. I seem to go in and out of it in my position. On the one hand, as far as workload and benefits go, I shouldn't really complain. I would fear spending so much effort switching jobs only to realize it's worse elsewhere. On the other, it's a death by a thousand cuts. But I don't know exactly what I'm looking for. I don't know what to tell my manager either since so much of it seems outside of our control and I don't want to merely complain. I'll think on it.\n\nI have searched for other jobs, but I just haven't had any luck. Most staff-level positions clearly have higher expectations and it's rare for me to make it past the screening or the first interview. And while I've gotten further for senior positions, still no dice. This becomes a bit of a feedback loop and at some point I give up for a while. \n\nSo my plan of action for now is to hold my position and work on my mental health first. Especially since I need employment to afford healthcare. 🤪 Regardless of whether I stay or not, that's kind of the bedrock of my ability to make sensible decisions. I'll also need to do some soul searching to nail down what it is exactly I enjoy and what would motivate me. From there I should hopefully be able to either have a productive conversation with my manager and/or keep applying for new jobs and not get demotivated by it.",

For the first year, I stressed myself out feeling for the walls and trying to figure out what it meant to be a staff, even with tremendous support from my peers and people above me. I ended up in the same boat as you, often looking for previous advice in this very subreddit for whether or not I should try and down level myself because I missed the work of a senior crushing tickets. At the 18 month mark at the company, I asked my manager to down level.\n\nIt was the single biggest awakening and biggest regret of my career that I didn't feel for 2 years.\n\nMy manager was very kind and heard me out on my reasons and took it up a level to the VP of Engineering where I was told, effectively, I could do the job, or I could quit. In the moment I was bitter about it, but I decided to do the job. Six months later I received my first \"below meets\" on an evaluation, because I asked to down level, and that wasn't staff engineer level behavior.  \n\n\nNever the less, I persisted, and took that moment as an opportunity to let go of all imposter syndrome and stress, and decide that \"I am a staff engineer, therefore everything I do is the behavior of a staff engineer\" and made the role my own. It was getting told no by that VP that made everything click, and made me realize that I am a very effective player-coach in up-skilling engineers, teams, code bases, and projects around me that I interacted with and I needed to act like it.\n\nUnfortunately, after this finally clicked fully, the company was bought out and in early 2025 underwent a 300 person RIF that I was hit by, and to this day I suspect the \"below meets\" was the thing that put me on the chopping block.\n\nHalf a year later I joined a company as a senior engineer and found myself extremely bored because the work was so easy I could do it with my arms behind my back, and I was surrounded by engineers who didn't care about the effort of work I was putting in. I then found out that I had minimal room to get promoted back to staff, for reasons that are unimportant, so I left and realized that I needed to keep setting my sights higher, not lower. If I could go back, I would thank that VP for putting me in that position, because it unlocked what I needed in my brain at the time, but I suspect we'll never actually interface again.\n\nObviously do what makes the most amount of sense to you. If you want to do it, you just need to sell the narrative that \"I am an engineer who is looking for the right fit, and the title is less important than the work.\" If I was in your shoes, and I could do it all over again, I would get over myself and press on. You ended up in the staff role for a reason, and because the type of work is very different from that of a senior, you just need to figure out how to make it your own where you can, and not just the expectation.",

If they know you as the guy who self-evaluated themselves as an L -1 then you'll likely get a below meets. Most of the promotions and perf reviews I've seen happen mainly come down to what perspective higher ups have about you/your biggest project. Even if you worked on 10 different projects, no one has time to go through all that so it's often way more vibes based once it gets to the senior director/VP level.",

Most interviewers didn't ask, those who did I was honest and said I tried LEad, hated the 6=8 hours of meetings a day, and went back to what I enjoy, most smiled and said they understood.

          "text": "Managed both senior and staff engineers. The transition between those levels is the most misunderstood one in our industry.\n\n  \nAt senior, you're given well-defined problems and evaluated on how well you solve them. The ambiguity is technical: which approach, what trade-offs, how to test.\n\n  \nAt staff, you're expected to FIND the problems. The ambiguity shifts from technical to organizational: what should we be working on? Which team needs unblocking? What's the architectural decision that nobody has made yet because nobody owns it? That's not a harder version of senior work - it's fundamentally different work.\n\n  \nThe \"faking it\" feeling you describe is common and usually means one of two things:\n\n  \n1. You don't enjoy the ambiguous, cross-team, \"find the problem\" work - and that's completely legitimate. Some excellent engineers are happier with well-scoped technical challenges. That's not failure. It's self-awareness.\n\n  \n2. You haven't been given the support structure to learn staff-level skills. Most companies promote to staff and then provide zero guidance on what that actually means day-to-day. The skills aren't \"be a better coder\" - they're \"figure out what the organization needs before anyone asks.\"\n\n  \nBefore requesting a demotion, figure out which one it is. If it's #1, go back to senior without guilt. If it's #2, consider whether a different company with better staff engineering culture would change the picture.",

He can't control the narrative in a meeting and gets trampled on by others. He easily says yes. He also can't seem make decisive actions on resources -- moving people in and out of projects as he doesn't want to hurt people's feelings and wants to  be the nice guy. He lacks people skills but he is the most senior in terms of technicals. He gets totally defeated as he is attending more meetings (meetings I use to attend). So he is experiencing all this corporate politics first hand now.\n\nIn out KT (knowledge transfer meetings), that is all that is talked about. How to deal with certain personalities versus asking me about how a service works or explaining parts of the code base. My only advice is not to be the nice guy, he only should answer to his direct change of command in leadership -- engineering.\n\nI have a lot of political capital and when push comes to shove, I can get things done. Either by building consensus or getting support from leadership. I can steer the direction of the product roadmap and prioritize in favor of the engineering team. We want things that are secure, scaleable, feature rich, reduce user churn, and make the product better. Other teams want to redesign the main dashboard again for the 10th time. We rather make life easier for customers to connect to their data and automate things versus changing one card from the left to the right expanding it by two columns with a new color palette.\n\nAny good books or resources for SWE.

In a professional and business setting, being a \"nice guy\" is one of the easiest ways to set a team or project up for failure.\n\nThis guy needs to learn to say \"no\" as their default response, or at least say \"it could be a possibility but I will need to look into it and follow-up afterwards\"... Basically respond with anything other than \"yes\". It is absolutely crucial to avoid making promises that have no realistic guarantee behind them.\n\nBeing a \"yes man\" only works for weak ass middle managers who can easily shift responsibility of delivery onto anyone else - and ultimately everyone ends up hating those kind of middle managers. (Meanwhile the projects and teams they delegate to will deteriorate in the messiest ways possible.)\n\nIf the individual is as spineless as you're describing and can't learn to say anything other than \"yes\", then they are certainly doomed to fail. The consequences will come fast and hard, hitting them directly along with everyone else on the team. Are you sure they're ready for this level of responsibility??\n\nOne final thought is a mantra I learned from one of my most successful mentors... \"Under-promise and over-deliver.\"",

Just for the fact the he's newer to this context, he's going to be a worse replacement for at least a whole after your knowledge transfer window is open.\n\nAlso be aware thst the new guy has a completely different standing than you. The guy that omboarded me as his replacement kept telling me that I need to be more assertive in my new role. The thing he doesn't know is that I kept getting reprimanded for standing up for my team against managers in my old project. I generally have no problem being assertive.\n\nBut he's asking me to be assertive about things that I'm not sure about towards people I just met, who I sometimes don't even really know what their role exactly is, in a meeting I'm missing a ton of context about. I have literally zero social standing with these people and when the new guy speaks up, people react completely differently to when someone speaks up who's been part of the project for years.\n\nSo I largely ignored his well meant \"advise\", took a ton of notes, met a ton of new people and know that everyone knows my face, I can be more assertive and tell people off. But it takes time.\n\nAnd you know what the most important part is? That I needed my onboarder to validate my thoughts and feelings about what happened in a meeting because sometimes the new guy is off-base on something that was decided before he joined the project. It was also extremely important that I can escalate issues to him without much of a fuzz. Sometimes I asked him to join a meeting or call and him showing up and showing that he backed my decision was huge for building my social standing with my new coworkers.\n\nMaybe OP's replacement is just a timid guy, but consider that in a new role, you lack both social standing and context and neither of those build up over night.",

Some companies even have incentives for employees to seek such arrangements. He could probably learn a lot from you, but he should also be seeking it out on his own.\n\n15 YOE is plenty. I have 14 myself, and honestly I think the new guy should be able to learn what is needed to get a grip on his new job. Strong technical background means he should be able to focus on what he has to learn. If he ends up struggling, or doesn't like – maybe he should stay in the technical domain and the new role is not for him. (I was given a mixed technical/TL role after just 10 YOE – similar situation with my background).\n\nIt sounds like the atmosphere at your workplace is quite complicated in terms of politics.",

When asked, they are never produced. And if there were user support tickets, it is ignored. Or it becomes a false blame game of previous decisions (which were theirs in the first place. As I always have receipts).  \n  \nWhen you show them friction and customer frustration that it takes x number (often 20+) steps to do something versus 3, they ignore it. And try to come back a month later with 10 steps but a month has been lost with no direction as they are experimenting. A lot of analysis by paralysis that cripples velocity. They don't know what they are doing; driven by certain egos. There are also internal power plays within those teams.

'hey your teammate agrees this is the priority too, based on the same data' is way more effective than an outsider coming in with charts. the irrational leaders lose when their own team starts aligning around evidence they can't dismiss as 'engineering trying to control the roadmap.' glad the trade-off framing is landing though, that's usually the first thing that clicks.",

With the exception of some customers (maybe), they are the ones who have the best grasp of actually using your product because they spend the majority of their day looking at it.\n\n\nBackend Devs don't because _\"ewww... yuck... CSS/JavaScript\"_ , POs only check if the latest feature is working as expected and sales only knows the current state.\n\n\nI don't know your product more than that is has a dashboard, but if your concerned about Devs asking for these changes just because, I'd encourage you (and them) to have a look at \"Visualising Streaming Data\" by Anthony Aragues.\n\n\nI know the title says \"streaming data\" but it'll give you a solid grasp about understanding how to best present data regardless. Who knows, maybe the Devs just lack the language to justify their requests. \n\n\nYou might be able to connect all the data sources in the world, but is your product looks dated, you'll loose customers.

A major shift like this is going to wreck people across the board.  Basically, if a ton of people default on student loans all at once because they can't repay them, it makes it harder for the younger generations to secure loans, which has been a primary way the young get higher education.\n\nFinal note: There's a lot of millenial and xennial devs that are at the latest 42 years old.  If the shift happens in the next 5-10 years, there is an entire generation of people stuck in that ugly bit of not being old enough to retire.\n\nSo yeah, people have a right to be worried about their future.",

          "text": "First of all, you need to understand that there's a lot of stuff you don't have control over. You could be in for the biggest depression in the world. Your future could be one of famine, war, poverty, and it could all happen easily with no chance you could prevent it. I see no reason why AI existing or not should really change that, and it's something you probably need to spend some time with and think about, rather than your focus on this specific issue. There's no guarantee that things get better, that things stay stable, that you as an individual of the billions of individuals on this planet have some type of right to life, liberty and happiness. If you have it today, use it, but don't try to control it.\n\nSecondly, perhaps your thought of \"This group seems to be shrinking after Opus 4.5 dropped\" is because we've all simply gotten tired of saying it. I've been using AI for three years now. I've been using it at work and personally. I've simply gotten tired of it. Every time I point an agent at a code base and ask for something to be done, I have to change the code. I end up spending so much time going back and forth or modifying sections of code that it's not any different than if I had written it myself, from scratch. I work on critical back end systems. I can imagine that if I was working on stuff that it didn't really matter whether it worked well or not, AI would be much more useful. If that's something you're working on, then the problem was more likely the work rather than the tooling. It was always going to go away.  \n  \nPeople in this forum talk as though we are all similar, but we are not. In this subreddit you could be talking to a junior web dev, a senior PLC programmer, an architect for big data, embedded systems. You could be talking to a person who works at a critical system for a bank or a person who makes a web application for generating selfies. Some people might have jobs that change, some people might not. You can't ever know.\n\nI will end with this. Jobs aren't really jobs. You aren't hired for your expertise, or your skillset, or your resume. You are always hired for two reasons, and two reasons only. You are useful, and you are likeable. If you are useful and likeable, you will always be in demand.",

He outlines **three “rip-cord” traps** that should make readers disengage:\n\n1. **Vibe Reporting**: articles imply a conclusion by *juxtaposing* loosely related facts and quotes while omitting key context—creating a “vibe” (e.g., pairing layoffs with generic AI-job-disruption quotes so readers assume “AI caused the layoffs,” even if it didn’t).\n2. **Mining Digital Ick**: stories cherry-pick weird edge-case demos from “AI wireheads,” focus on how unsettling it is, but skip technical specifics and concrete implications—so the piece mainly manufactures discomfort.\n3. **Faux Astonishment**: especially common in YouTube—everything is framed as insane/terrifying/seismic, producing a constant panic haze without precise claims you can check.",

It’s a mistake, but it is what it is.\n\nThat’s the real issue imo. Not that software engineers get wiped out.

What you’re feeling is real and valid and a lot of people are right there with you even if they won’t admit it.\n\nBut I want to be straight with you about something. You said when you got your first job you thought you were set for life. That was never true, even before AI. Industries change, companies fold, entire job markets disappear. The idea that any degree or any career is a guaranteed ticket for life is something we all got sold and it was never real. That’s not an AI problem, that’s just how it’s always been.\n\nHere’s what I’d actually suggest. You’re a dev with several years of experience. That means you know how to learn, how to problem solve, how to think logically. Those skills don’t become worthless because AI can write code. If anything they become more valuable because someone still needs to understand what the AI is doing, why it’s wrong, and how to use it properly. The devs who will struggle are the ones who refuse to engage with it. The ones who lean in and learn how to work with it are going to be fine.\n\nBut more importantly, and I mean this genuinely, you need to step back from the doom scrolling. Half the takes on here are from people who don’t know what they’re talking about and the other half are people who are just as scared as you projecting their anxiety as certainty. None of them know what’s going to happen. Nobody does. You’re losing sleep over a future that doesn’t exist yet and might never exist in the way you’re imagining.\n\nGo learn how to use the tools. Get familiar with them. Once you actually understand what AI can and can’t do the fear gets a lot smaller. It’s the uncertainty that’s killing you, not the technology.",

Difference is that I probably wrote 5-10% of our code last year, the rest being architecture and design decisions. The rest of the code was written by AI. I’m getting the same output as I would’ve gotten in a strong team of 2 or even 3 good developers. I have friends employed in META and Google and their internal tools are even better than what I can use myself (Claude code now). \n\nI also suffer from anxiety and I can relate with how you’re feeling. You REALLY need to go to a therapist.  You need to get your sleep in order, start exercising and eating healthy. I know you probably don’t feel like getting out of bed sometimes, but I PROMISE you it will get better. You just got to start working towards managing the anxiety. So therapy, exercise, sleep, human connection. And stop reading stuff that worries you. You already have all the information, whatever you read next won’t make you more prepared. Managing the anxiety will. \n\nYou really need to start taking control of your destiny and accept you can’t control what happens in the outside world. Whether AI replaces all the jobs in the world or not, it’s not within your control. Anxiety gets better once you try and begin to find solutions. A few ideas to take control of your own destiny:\n1. Try to find a job in more traditional businesses. I doubt banks are going to get their software maintained by AI anytime soon. Or military equipment companies. So try to find a job in a sector like this. This will maximize your runway IF what you’re worried about ends up affecting your job. \n2. Do you have an expensive lifestyle? Try to simplify it. Ideally get your monthly burn rate down to what can be covered through other jobs. \n3. Really spend the time changing the physiological things affecting anxiety. Sleep, food, exercise. \n4. Try to get some perspective about your own capabilities . Even if the worst thing happens, you’ll deal with it. You can do it. Becoming a software engineer isn’t easy, you’ve already achieved something that most people are probably not able to. \n\n\nDo you have any savings or investments?",

AI requires a focused context in order to do its very best work as anything broader invites assumptions and unexpected outcomes. I believe this is because AI doesn't actually have the ability to know what it does not know. Now imagine how that will work when people who have ZERO systems knowledge want the AI to be their chief translator of a world they can barely begin to understand. It would take nothing short of AGI.\n\nSecondly, if you fear that there will just be fewer engineers. Then my question is why that didn't happen with all the frameworks and tools we use today. We have optimized development extremely before the era of AI and yet it only led to more demand for software. Software in your TV, software in your car, software on your toaster, and in your wearables.\n\nSoon AI will enable the rapid building of software for your shoes, your gym locker, your dental implants and your dog.\n\nAnd if the barrier to software development were to fall severely, then companies would no longer stay in their lane when it comes to what they build. So every SAAS can become more like Google, with software solutions for broader market demands.\n\nAnd if you think all that is wrong, then consider what a disadvantage it is for companies to shed all these employees who just replaced themselves with AI, as those engineers are now all 1-person companies ready to compete with their former employers if they just license once of these models. The concept of anyone making a huge profit by running away with the bulk of the market share suddenly dwindles in such a world.\n\nAll of this rapid change does not spell the end of our profession, it spells another step up in abstraction for building an even more deeply software integrated world and you are there at the birthplace of this moment.

The story of pretty much all technological innovations is that they improve rapidly at the start, but with enough time, the improvements start to become more diminishing. In other words: every exponential is a sigmoid in disguise. Think about when the first iPhone was released; it was pretty radical in terms of new tech. But how about the 7th iPhone or the 12th iPhone? Not too different from the ones before. The same is going to be the case with AI and LLMs. In fact, I think it's pretty much the case that we're at the beginning of the plateau phase. Training and inferencing LLMs is running into energy limits, data limits, architectural limits and computational limits; on top of all that, any increases in data, compute, etc. are tempered by the fact that neural scaling laws follow an inverse power law which is increasing but concave down. So in due time, we will reach a point where LLMs more or less \"peak\" and by then they will become more normal and less disruptive; and I think we are not too far away from that point. Hope this helps, dude. :)",

A human being has a context window of 24 hours. We need to sleep and process information. We distill past events such that we’re not recalling every conversation about a certain topic. An LLM’s context window is only a couple of million tokens. Essentially as the conversation grows the less precise LLM’s become. The bigger issue is that in order to process that kind of information you’ll need to scale data centers more and more. And that means bigger data centers which means costs start to increase.",

I'm just gonna give you a shorter version: literally no one here is going to have an answer to this. As you go through more life experiences you will realize 2 things, life isn't fair and will never operate how you think it operates, and no one knows wtf they are actually talking about. You will get an split on people's opinions on AI depending on where you ask, I think you made up your mind on the topic so i'm not going to agree or disagree with you. If you want my annecdote then I am a software engineer at a FAANG and my team of pretty much all seniors at this point has hired almost no one the past year or so and all of us use AI in our workflow. Will we be replaced? Find out on the next episode. I can give you an entire essay on why or why not AI can or cannot do my job and all of it can be rendered useless with another research breakthrough or update. And honestly this doesn't really tackle your root issues and insecurities. Even if everyone here tells you opus isn't good and you read all this feels good circle jerk hope slop about how \"AI is actually going away soon and was useless this entire time you guys, we are all about to get 300K TC jobs baby\" you will just have this cycle again the next update, then the next unless you genuinely believe 2026 is the year that technological progress halts for the rest of time compared to every other year in human history. GPT-3 barely came out 3 years ago and the world's perception of what was possible changed. Just a year ago no one was seriously using it for even 30% of the tasks and now it's usage is pretty darn high. None of us control if opus 5.0 or 10.0 is better.\n\nYou either go on with life or keep worrying about it and let it consume you. You are sold a lie that life works a certain way if you do x,y and z and you are \"set\" but no one knows what they are doing or what they are talking about. Not your parents, not your professors, not most people you looked up to. Not me, not the top 5 reddit comments that have the most upvotes. It's all survivorship bias, annecdotes and being at a certain place at a certain time. In this point of time in space you are complaining about AI, you could have easily been complaining about another economic great depression which would have wiped out the remaining jobs anyway and have you fighting for mcdonalds job applications. You have no real control over what happens and you can only control how you react to this. Either make a back up plan to pivot out of the career or ride it out really, everyone is going to be in the same boat if AI does get as good as you say it will. Seek therapy, get medication if you need for sleep and anxiety. Maybe go down the line of becoming less terminally online, doomscrolling less and maybe read a book or two on embracing life uncertainties. Things will happen that you will not like or know the answer to, reading every other idiot's opinion on it such as myself doesn't do any good and won't make whatever has you feeling uneasy disappear from reality.",

This study looked many fields of studies, not only programming. Multiple well-known current AI's were used (GPT5.2 scoring 2nd place with 2.5% of success rate if memory serves me right). This means that both AI and humans were given the same task to complete with the same input information. A failure for AI was considered every time it failed to complete the task; or did not complete the task at least as well as human participants did. Amongst most dominant problems were that AI left part of the tasks incomplete resulting in automatically scoring as a failure. This aligns with what I have also observed.\n\nThe current state of AI seems to be that human produces high quality work products. AI is significantly faster but the output is most of the times low-quality. I see them being used in tandem for a long time. I view AI mostly as search engine on steroids — nothing more.",

Calculate how much runway you have in case you were to lose your job (and be sure to factor unemployment insurance and other benefits into that).

I've been a software dev for 15 years now and work as an architect, but now I barely feel like I'm even engineering as much, even when working in an aerospace engineering lab.\n\n\nI think it's going to require a fundamental shift in how we think about engineering as the changes take place. You have skills. I wouldn't hire anyone that was just a prompt engineer. I wouldn't trust anyone that couldn't do a proper code review or even the principles of proper development. You likely have those skills and you can understand what the logs are saying as the AI models run. You can steer it in different directions. As these tools change, we'll adapt to them. I think it just depends on whether or not you want to accept those changes or move into something different. You worked hard to be in this position and you have the intelligence to shift into other fields if you want to. ",

I think juniors are gonna get squeezed, but all signs point to things being probably more nuanced. \n\nIBM and Salesforce have already done major personnel reductions and regretted it. It seems many orgs just aren’t hiring as many devs. So in the short term the market is going to suck, for sure. \n\nBut I have opinions on why “something big” is probably bullshit. \n\nMajor enterprise orgs are slow, and AI so far at the enterprise level has had mixed results\n\nWhen you read a job description, does it usually say “tasks”? Nah, it says responsibilities. But this makes sense, do you think many companies are comfortable saying “we are ok with a non-deterministic computer program being responsible for our orgs functionality, product, finances, legal”?\n\nAlso competitive advantage, replacing workers with AI (and replacing is big here, cause giving people AI tools can really improve efficiency and the job itself for the employee) drains a company of its unique (maybe not always great) talent and replace them with basically AI contractors. \n\nNot to mention the comfort level of orgs to basically rent their entire workforce from a saas company. Companies can decide how much they pay for labor, and at a very granular level, AI is tokens baby, whether you ask for the cure to cancer or furry porn, it’s all just tokens. Companies are reliant on the relationship with their vendor. People freak out about vendor lock in with security tools, imagine your whole company. \n\nAlso the data centers, you’re dependent on their uptime and security, I’d imagine in a future with 20% unemployment those buildings would become incredibly flammable. \n\nOr incredibly soft targets for foreign actors. Imagine a hack that takes those data centers down in one region for maybe two days? Failover of course but man the ability to have massive disruption is technoeconomic terrorism (trademark) \n\nLook, things are changing, if your only responsibility is “write code” you’re boned. If your responsibility is “identify problems, customer pain points, cost savings, potential risks…” then lean into that. \n\nOh and I try and say nice things to the toaster JIC.",

Learn about AI, there lies the answer of why software engineering will not go away, but your skill set will definitely have to change, not so different to learn a new language or a new framework...**  \n  \nYou should really study AI, not to \"git gud\" but that would help you understand its limitation\n\nCause it has limitations, unfixable limitations, by design.\n\nAI companies are BLEEDING money madly trying to both, win the AI race (race that is literally unwinnable, AGI is imposible with the current approach) or trying to get enough market share, once things settle, prices will then go stupid high and vibecoding garbage will be punished.\n\nLook at OpenAI sinking, Look how how Anthropic is adjusting and forcing everybody into their closed ecosystem.\n\nTry to run a \"small\" model in your computer..... it takes 64Gb of RAM to run a model equivalent to GPT4 mini.... once the AI companies adjust their prices, private companies will try to run proprietary/open models and quickly figure out that it takes a LOT of money to do it, the software engineering will be the answer for this, not everything has to be AI, deterministic code still has value, it is orders of magnitude cheaper, guess who can trace, plan, design and maybe even manually code these.... yes, software engineers.\n\nNo, you can not fully replace developers the same way you can not replace a builder just because you have 3D printers for buildings, somebody still has to operate those machines.\n\nYes, work will change and yes, a LOT of people will lose their jobs during the adjustment of the market, but eventually the dust will settle and companies will start hiring again, because software at its core is still valuable, it is actually more valuable now that you can use agents to interconnect software tools and it is faster to prototype and deliver small pieces of software and tools.\n\nThings will change, yes, SaaS will probably die as building dedicated systems is now not a completely retarded decision and buying a big product is now harder to justify if you can hire a rockstar engineer that can partner with your domain experts to deliver a highly specialized custom software.  \n  \nBut putting anybody on charge of building the software will lead to disaster, engineering is still needed, not because code reusability and structures are critical (you can argue they are, as the AI codes better when the codebase is better...) but because a system designed badly will fail sooner or later and rebuilding it, even though takes several times less time, still wrecks companies that rely on software to operate, the systems thinking that makes software engineering highly valuable is still there.\n\nSoftware engineers will probably now migrate to integrate into several areas that could not afford software before, \"smaller\" business than can now get a tangible return of investment if they hire a developer, cause a good lone developer can deliver a lot using AI, you don't need a full department anymore, having one or two engineers per company is a great idea these days.\n\nDon't be terrified, if AI is going to replace everybody, somebody has to write all the tools and software needed to do so.... and no, AI can not do it by itself, it needs guidance and a plan, it needs decisions landed on reality and it is as of now, imposible to model reality, no way to process the amount of continuos values produced by .... real life.\n\nOnce AI is able to replace developers, it will literally be able to replace the whole humanity and well.... at that point either money loses all sense, because nobody will work, or we as a species are done anyway.",

Most days were 2 and i shot for 1 at a minimum.  \n\nAfter Opus 4.6 - The speed at which i can ship with a couple AI bots is staggering.  I still have to train them and correct them but i'm shipping dozens of things per day - and that is only because my capacity to review the changes is limited by me AND the number of things product needs me to do is limited by their brains.\n\nIf the rate of change from 4.5 to 4.6 continues where the next model ever 2-3 months is an order of magnitude better, i won't need to be in the loop directly in 9-12 months and i will be exclusively on the business and product side, which is ok because i have been leading multiple teams of humans like this for a long time. \n\nI definitely wouldn't want to be a regular engineer right now.  Senior engineers will arguably not be needed and i think the only people that will be left are the folks that have the unique mix of business, leadership and technical prowess to be able to target the bots in the right way.\n\nTime will tell.",

I'm doing this across 2 products, one that has paying customers another that is greenfield.\n\nToday i implemented a feature on the side project i have wanted for years but didn't want to do because of the complexity.

Getting started always feels chunky because you don't do it often, and the circumstances tend to change enough over context or time that it isn't quite the same each time.  Reducing the \"just work\" costs is a good thing!  They are inevitably steps that should be well-understood but not cost any more cognitive load than is useful for the initiative.\n\nThey become an anchor on productivity when they aren't understood or skipped \"for this one hot initiative\", which over time in a long-lived codebase becomes mixed zones of different standards.  The boring tasks become a productivity anchor because the last person who skipped them more-than-doubled the work of the next person impacted by their tech debt -- the interest payments always come calling.\n\nTo setup an analogy: when you're optimizing for performance a classic mis-optimization is to not take measurements to diagnose the performance issues before you start making changes. You might make some code run faster, but if the actual issue is lock contention -- your objectively better code on paper could make the real issue worse!\n\nThe boring work in my experience often isn't the productivity killer, even though it's a convenient punching bag for time not spent well and observable tech debt accretion.  The real productivity killers in my experience have always been higher level issues: ill-defined or understood contracts and expectations across separation of responsibilities, shifting and/or poorly-defined requirements, unnecessary context switching from a chaotic lack of planning, in-fighting over continuously punting the opportunity to disagree-and-commit over strategic decisions to avoid conflict.\n\nThe pet phrases I use to anthropomorphize these issues are:\n- rowing separate boats in the same direction\n- tactical solutions in a strategic direction\n\nBoth of which require sufficient product _and technical_ vision for separate groups to be properly incentivized to work together in a commonly understood direction.  If your boat is frantically zig-zagging for fear of heading in the wrong direction, the ride is going to feel worse than taking fewer and smaller course corrections because you can't generate productive momentum.  If your boat is tied to a dozen others all doing the same thing? It doesn't matter if the cost of checking the wind in a new direction or identifying your current position got cheaper -- you won't be going anywhere anyway, you're just making the boring work to change direction feel nicer.",

AI only helps with the 20%.\n\n  \nthe metric nobody's measuring but should: how much time does your team spend reviewing, debugging, and fixing AI-generated code vs. the time it saved writing it? on my team that ratio is close to 1:1 on complex features. the net gain is real but modest, and it's concentrated in the boring parts of the job.",

Not only is it time consuming to review AI-generated code, but you can also waste time _arguing_ with the AI during review.\n\n\nClaude Opus also has this annoying habbit of changing its thinking process mid way through a response when you ask it for help reviewing code, e.g. it can say _\"there's a bug in function Foo()\"_ and you go read function Foo() to see what's going on, you find nothing there, come back to finish reading its response only to find it saying _\"actually, this is correct\"_. After a few episodes of this game you start wondering: why am I using AI at all here?\n\n\nI think things will get better over time but as things stand AI is a _net unknown_ (i.e. you can't tell whether it's helping or hurting).",

It's not infallible and you need to review its output, but I will take some back-and-forth with Claude over trying to untangle human spaghetti code any day. If you're not getting good results like this, I think you should really look at how you're prompting it and managing context. If you just give it ambiguous prompts and throw your whole repo at it it's kind of a 'crap in, crap out' situation. If you give it a framework and requirements up front and let it break work into reasonable chunks (you know, what a human developer would also want), it can do small miracles.\n\nHonestly I don't know what universe the people saying AI is useless are living in.

I'll take that \"upgrade agent\" service I built with Claude as an illustrative example again.\n\nI had a pretty good idea of how I wanted the app to work before I wrote any code. I knew I wanted it to be driven by a state machine, and I already had a simple state machine class for it to use as a basis. It would have a CLI interface for monitoring/manually controlling the state machine, and an event-driven interface (basically it's a subscriber to some messages from other services). I knew exactly what state transitions I wanted to support and what behavior I wanted on edge transitions. I documented all of this in one big 'requirements doc', but didn't actually break the work up into sub-tasks or anything. I asked it to write documentation of the code it was producing.\n\nI gave it the document and asked it to implement the application and write unit tests to verify. At first, the code it produced didn't compile. I had to go through a few iterations of feeding back the compiler errors and asking it to fix the code. Then tests wouldn't pass. A few more iterations. After not too long, it got there.\n\nThen I reviewed its code. It took some weird architectural liberties. Partially I think this was my fault; I gave it a big blob of requirements and said \"build this thing\". Even though my document was pretty good, it left some wiggle room, and Claude went way too hard trying to cover edge cases that don't exist or adding functionality that was extraneous or redundant. I prompted it to remove things I thought were unnecessary, and it did a pretty good job cleaning up after itself when prompted. Sometimes it would break its own unit tests while cleaning up and it would need to go through some more debugging iterations to get them working again. Overall, its style was very consistent; good function and variable names, generally following SOLID principles. In some places I could see it was making the unit tests harder by not following principles like dependency injection and I asked it to refactor/use mocks in the tests.\n\nAfter that I asked it to implement the CLI tool. Similar kind of debugging cycle and hiccups. All told, I probably spent \\~2 hours on that initial chat session. Then, I had to take what it produced and load it in my staging environment and see how it worked. It had like 3-4 critical issues that prevented it from working properly, which I debugged myself but weren't very hard to figure out. I gave it feedback about what was wrong and it did a good job making appropriate changes. Overall, that was like another \\~3-4 hours I guess? After that my stuff was in pretty good shape, I think there were other minor fixes and refactors after that, but 6 hours or so of hanging out with Claude gave me a working service, CLI tool, and pretty solid unit tests.\n\nIts coding style was good, and maybe most importantly, consistent in a way that humans often struggle with. I find that humans often make typos, use inconsistent formatting, put logic in places it doesn't belong, create \"mega methods\" that are a tangled mess of if-else logic, tightly couple things that don't need to be tightly coupled, mess up shared state in multi-threaded applications...other cardinal sins. You can say \"well, the people who do that are bad programmers\". Maybe...but there's a lot of people out there making these mistakes and littering code bases with little idiosyncrasies! Claude writes in a way that feels like an amalgamation of generalized best practices, even if it doesn't have much creativity and needs some hand holding.\n\n\\--\n\nMy takeaways from this were that it is a bit of a Monkey's Paw; Claude will fill in the gaps in your prompts with its own interpretations that are only occasionally correct. It often over-complicates things and needs to be reigned in. It works best when given very clear instructions to do something cut-and-dry. But this is all true of human developers too...again, the up-front work of specifying what you want and breaking it into sub-tasks seems like a huge determinant of the outcome.",

How would I show you evidence of me working faster lmao.\n\nI can give you a recent example from my work, I opened an archaic-ass JSF project and had to add a new page to it for a client who refuses to migrate to our new Angular based UI (JSF one is handled by backend teams, unfortunately) and spent 10 minutes explaining how I want the UI to work, prepared a bean with mock methods for it to wire up and had it generate the entire UI in a couple of prompts. I think the entire process took less than an hour and then I just finished up the backend part myself.\n\nNot only did I not have to look through the *rather old* JSF documentation but also skipped, what is for me, the most unpleasant part of working on that system, which honestly does slow me down out of just really not wanting to interact with it. \n\nAnother recent-ish example I can give I was pretty stumped on some java agents not injecting/connecting to a service, seemingly out of the blue, and after asking Gippity it threw out a \"By the way, the parameter format for this changes from :\\*: to \\*:\\* in this version\" and lo and behold that was a few hours of digging through commits to find out that indeed someone had upgraded it recently.\n\nI'm not some AI apologist that believes it's the cure-all for software engineering, but if you can't speed any part of your work up with them then that's either a you-issue or you're working on something incredibly bespoke/have such perfect knowledge of your stack that you rarely look anything up.\n\nI already said this but I will reiterate that I have a set amount of mental energy for the day, having to deal with something which is simple but tedious (any kind of UI, for one) depletes it faster, because it's finnicky and boring to me - this is a \"soft\" speed increase in that I don't feel done for the day as soon when I have to deal with less things I dislike.",

The problem is that AI lacks the human perspective and while it can \"help\" in tasks like organizing information and writing reports, it can also confidently present incorrect information which can completely throw off research efforts, simply because it was trained that way.\n\nIt has no true grasp of human intuition, the human experience, or empathy, which are often essential to forming research questions and interpreting findings in fields like psychology.  And ironically, psychology plays a significant role in software design since we build processes and often organize them in ways that make sense to us.  Object oriented programming is about mapping real world entities such as people, concepts, or things, into objects with specific behaviors in a system.  Our view points and feelings do impact how we implement those objects and while some parts are going to be identical, I've yet to see identical code between two people writing from scratch.\n\nAI does not improve readability, the user experience, or resource efficiency.  It forces compliance and rigid doctrine to code that is written to function rather than to be understood, built without any linkage to a living person, and maybe if we're lucky it will have some AI generated XML summary that states a generic message that will be created in a dozen or so unique iterations depending on how the dice roll.\n\nOh, I'm sorry!  AI DOES write code that is linked to living people because that is what it is trained off of!  It's trained off the hard work of other people who wrote books, code examples, etc.  It's great for replacing people and jobs so companies can spend less on \"human resources\".  \n\nBusinesses don't care if code is readable, simplified, SOLID, or anything like that. They want stuff predictably released without going back and forth with a human trying to answer the golden question of \"how long will this take?\"\n\nSorry I'm just a bitter person when it comes to this subject.",

          "text": "Well when I started at this startup (SaaS app) about a year ago — I’m 20 years in tech, senior tech lead, full stack, previous CTO in dev shops — our initial technical stack was:\n\nPostgres  \nGraphQL  \nNode.js  \nReact Router / TypeScript / Vite\n\nWe had expected to spend on a 4-person tech team.\n\nOver the past year that changed. It’s been one: me as the developer. Our PM even spun up a Playwright UX testing suite to run app tests. A year later I’ve delivered a first-gen product that’s performant and tested.\n\nImportant caveat upfront: at every stage I still needed to review AI output and check code. So it’s not necessarily faster.\n\nBut it absolutely requires fewer human resources. That’s the real lesson for me.\n\nHere’s where AI has made the biggest impact in my work:\n\n1. SQL and GraphQL — just easy to generate with modern coding models.\n2. Documentation — I’ve never had this much documentation (valid and updated) on a project in my past 20 years, including when I worked at NASA. These days (last couple weeks) I use Claude to auto-update docs and its Notion connector to publish our wiki from them.\n3. TypeScript — not only initial prototyping but ongoing backend and frontend development.\n4. Mobile — I added a full React Native frontend for native mobile since I had the time. Normally a 3–6 month effort.\n5. Unit testing — it’s very good. With the caveat that I validate each test to prevent performative “test theater” AI slop.\n6. Code review and GitHub management — added two levels of code review via LLM using GitHub’s MCP and code review models. For most of the year I had to be really careful because AI drifts on every run and makes stupid assumptions, but lately with newer models it’s gotten significantly better.\n7. Frontend — Opus is strong. Not as good as having a senior frontend dev with years of experience, but I have enough experience to manage things like useEffect overuse, bad UX decisions, and when the LLM doesn’t modularize properly on first pass.\n8. UX design — we had a designer on contract in the first pass a year ago, but now we iterate between CEO/COO, PM, and myself using [v0.dev](http://v0.dev), mock tools, and AI graphic tools like Ideogram for icons and SVGs.\n9. Cloud deployment and CI/CD — Docker, infra, all of it is much easier with LLMs handling syntax and boilerplate. I review everything before implementing. In the past I might have contracted a DevOps person. That’s no longer needed.\n\nAnyway, I could go on. Basically every aspect of design, development, and engineering work has shifted.\n\nAI needs a lot of review and overhead and makes a lot of bad assumptions and mistakes, especially not the overarching technical direction. You’re still the engineer. You’re still reviewing. You’re still catching the dumb stuff and reviewing at the code level if you want to keep your sanity.\n\nBut one or two experienced persons can now cover most of the surface area that used to take a team.\n\nIs it less stressful? No. It increases responsibility and cognitive load.\n\nIs it more fun? Yes and no. It’s fun to prototype and validate assumptions quickly. But the mental overhead is real.\n\nThis article feels accurate right now:  \n[https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it](https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it)\n\nWhat this looks like five years from now, I have no idea. Every layer of engineering is under intense experimentation as startups try to automate engineers out of existence. I don’t think full replacement is feasible.\n\nBut in my own experience over the last two years, it’s a real structural shift.",

Yet it's very difficult to. So difficult that even now, we don't really have a set of accepted metrics that we can judge our performance on. Obviously there are a few metrics that exist that absolutely should be looked at like service uptime/reliability and resource usage (that's why observability exists for these) but it's not really holistic enough to judge the software as a whole. Every other metric is either subjective (UX quality) or is going to be gamed\n\nSo your question would imply that there is a set of metrics that we can judge software on, when we've been unable to do so since the beginning of the profession. Thus the question feels somewhat flawed/contradictory.\n\nNow to management, the only metric that they care about is capex and revenue/profit. If they can get away with cutting wage capex without seeing huge plummets in revenue due to downtime and such, they will absolutely slash the fuck out of that spend. Even traditional software companies aren't free from this thought process, ex. Zuck's \"year of efficiency\"",

What it’s currently doing: just increasing code volume, which means more reviews, more integration work, and more maintenance, and it’s even used as a justification to squeeze productivity without hiring.\n\nWe need to organise and form unions. The current wave of AI output wouldn’t even exist without all of the illegally scraped open-source projects, Stack Overflow posts, blogs, and documentation written by actual developers.\n\nAnd honestly, this situation also reflects a culture in tech that too often pushes people to compete ruthlessly instead of collaborating and standing up for better conditions together.

Let alone getting them done part time in under a year. Oh, and they're done in languages that aren't my primary language. \n\nAt work, we have significantly higher velocity with fewer devs. Quality overall one first pass is also much higher because we don't have to skip/compromise for happy path (e.g., we handle edge cases out of the gate) because it's trivial to write massive numbers of tests. The trend seems to be that a single developer can take on more scope in the same amount of time. So the the MVP we had planned is now effectively what we planned on the 3 year roadmap. This in about 6 months with a small team. Originally we had planed 3 or 4 teams after MVP.\n\nThs biggest challenge is that gaps in layers are highlighted. For instance, backend work with AI is much, much easier. The front-end is lagging but that's partly because of design and because actually *using* the software by users takes time.\n\nThere is also the risk of burnout and cognitive load catching up to everyone. For instance, doing all the security and compliance on top of all the code we've built is going to come to a head. Operationally we may also pay the piper but we're trying to adjust now before release. Our biggest challenge is hiring.",

Alerting is supposed to be actionable, and customer oriented. The story you tell is not that. And if the Product Owner wants this, there are other, better ways to achieve it than sleep deprivation.\n\n> 99% of which are false alarms for a p90 latency spike for an http endpoint\n\nFundamentally, alerting is a statistical exercise. Your quote there has like three statistical concepts already! Yet pretty much every SWE and SRE I've ever met are statistically undereducated. Myself included! It wasn't until pandemic lockdown that I corrected this and worked through a stats 101 textbook.\n\nThe way I see it, we can't do anything about slow queries that already happened, all we can do is adjust the system to handle future queries better. So any alert fired should represent a high confidence need for human intervention into the system. Statistically, confidence is built up through piles of data -- evidence! An endpoint with ten queries per scrape interval has less evidence than one with a thousand, and alerting needs to account for that somehow. \n\nSadly, Prometheus et al don't have great confidence interval functions we could use to natively calculate these. Instead **we typically use durations.** The idea here is simple: every scrape the failure signal persists is more evidence that it won't fix itself. This is especially important in the era of Kubernetes, where self-healing systems abound. Health checks automatically restart failed pods, and hpa scales up busy deploys, but these take time to action and we should give them a chance. If you're constantly waking up to pages for outages that are already over, that's an immediate argument for increasing the duration required before paging.\n\nIf SRE can't or won't accommodate you by increasing short (or absent!) durations, I recommend putting an override in to put them on call first until it's addressed.",

That decision had a cost, and that cost is being silently absorbed by whoever is on-call. The SRE team who set the thresholds doesn't get woken up at 3am for a p90 latency spike. The person who approved the policy doesn't see the Slack channel with 80 acknowledge messages per week.\n\n  \nThe fix isn't better alerting tools or tweaking thresholds. The fix is making the cost visible to the people who made the decision:\n\n  \n\"We're spending approximately X hours of engineering time per week responding to alerts. 99% of these are false alarms that require no action. The response time requirement means at least Y interrupted sleep cycles per on-call rotation. Here's what we could be building with that time instead.\"\n\n  \nPut that in a doc. Present it to engineering leadership. Frame it as a trade-off, not a complaint: \"We can keep the current alerting posture and accept this cost, or we can adjust thresholds to alert only on actionable conditions. Which do you prefer?\"\n\n  \nWhen you present the cost in terms of engineer-hours and opportunity cost, the \"we MUST have these alerts\" mandate usually gets reconsidered pretty quickly. People who mandate processes are rarely aware of what those processes actually cost.",

I let it run for 48 hours and the results reveal a shit show. \n\nmain find is a ghost transaction, the app thought it was updating ledger balances but thanks to a nested try/catch it was swallowing a specific pdo exception. transaction started but zero commits. the app was clueless and kept it pushing like there was no issue and logs showed success. my little shim called it's bluff and exposed 5 figures of loss vanishing into the void. \n\nI'm not selling anything or looking for a gig, just wanted to start some discussion and see how you guys are verifying data integrity in monolithic systems from before observability was such a big deal. I've been thinking about cleaning this shim up and making it a standard audit tool to maybe help some of my brethren get a little extra sleep if there's a need. \n\nif you have a legacy stack that's full of crap like this or you've caught similar ghost transactions I'd love to hear about it (and how you catch/mitigate them in legacy systems), especially if there's a better way I'm missing!",

Also forcing explicit commit checks and logging transaction boundaries helped a lot. If a transaction starts, something must log its outcome.\n\nYour shim idea actually makes sense as an internal guardrail. Especially in stacks where you cannot realistically refactor the world.

Because of that, I let my manager know that if she noticed any hint of a drop in my performance, I would like to know so there was absolutely no chance of me getting fired.\n\nA bit of background for my manager and myself. She gave me a bad performance review last time round(it was totally fair, I wasn't performing due to health reasons and being very down mentally) and then she gave me goals to complete. I crushed all the goals, she said that I was doing a great job and that it was a night and day difference in how I was performing. \n\nTwo weeks ago we had a 1:1 and I asked her about her expectations for a promotion and she was guiding me on how to frame my performance review to be more likely to get it.\n\nToday, I was let go. As it happens I was about to hand in my notice and it worked out perfectly. \n\nThe reason I received was that I didn't have as many PRs as the next person, I'm the lowest in that regard and in points completed. We have a minimum rate of 1 point per ticket so people can just spam 1 pointer tickets that take no time so their points are inflated while mine are mostly bigger tickets where 3 points require work. I also got let go for behavior reasons yet she didn't provide a single concrete example.\n\nThe HR guy was sympathetic and he said that my manager dropped the ball and that I should have had chances to catch this. They're at least paying the full notice period and as it happens, my pay ends one day before I start the new job, so I have a few months of paid holiday!\n\nIf I didn't have the next job lined up I would be completely screwed. Word around the office is that the company is cutting headcount and I think this was a case of \"if you beat the data hard enough, it'll tell you what you want to hear\". \n\nThoughts? \n\nThis isn't in the US btw.",

I had started a bit earlier that day and no one else from my team responded. Since I was already online, I said I would take a look.\n\nWhat I thought would be a quick check turned into two hours of deep diving into logs, tracing code and trying to understand what broke. I finally found the issue and came up with a fix. Because of the pressure and urgency, I skipped full unit testing. We pushed the hot fix, hoping for relief. Instead, it made things worse.\n\nAt that point my heart honestly dropped. We had to roll everything back and start again, this time doing it properly. Even though my superiors were very supportive, it was one of the most stressful days I have had. By the end of it, I was completely drained and just grateful the day was over.\n\nCurious to hear yours. What was the day that really tested you as a developer?",

But my director (who I hated already) wanted constant updates, explanations, debugging, even though I was not in charge of the release and had already explained everything and our reasoning. So while the skydiving instructors are suiting us up and going over instructions and safety, I’m constantly sneaking out my phone to send slack messages trying to calm down my director. \n\nAt some point I realized just how ridiculous this all was, that I was literally about to jump out of a plane and I was far more stressed about my director being mad about this stupid script. I put my phone away finally, vowed to find a new job, and had a ton of fun skydiving. The script ended up finishing in time, and I had a new job 6 weeks later.",

Cause was that when radar is not yet ready, it tries to connect and if it fails, it terminates — basically race condition at boot-up. We had safety procedures in place to not allow autonomous driving and come to a stop when radar data timeouts which never got triggered.\n\nThe procedure interacting with radar driver forwarded latest received radar data with fresh timestamp. It was set on loop according to the expected requirement to send message every 100ms. When driver had update, a buffer was overridden. And when it was time, the buffer was sent out. However, if buffer was filled with old data (or nothing at all), it still got forwarded as \"no obstacles\". Timestamp was supposed to be of the data, not message timestamp.

At no point did I ever feel any pressure to reschedule my surgery or come in anyway, but after having been at home for a few days I was going stir crazy and decided to surprise my colleagues by showing up.\n\nTurns out it was a good thing I did. Not long after we started, we hit an error none of us had ever seen before. My manager was all set to call the vendor’s support when I realized that a) I knew what the problem was, and b) it had likely just fixed itself\\*.   So I said, “Hey, hit “retry”,” it worked, and thus was a long and involved support call that probably would have gone nowhere avoided.\n\n\\* So, the particular thing that failed: one part of our upgrade process was basically “take a backup of the database, fail it over to the hot standby, then do an extra differential backup just in case”.  The first backup worked, the failover worked, the second backup failed. The reason: it was the first time we’d run the process against a database of any appreciable size, and it took a couple of minutes before it became available. We were just trying too fast.",

          "text": "They published full details in status updates publicly so I'm luckily not breaching NDA to talk about this. I was in the Compute team at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure at the time.\n\n\nWe had an incident about 4 years ago, a bug in a log rotation tool kicked in at midnight UTC (late afternoon Pacific Time where I'm based.) I forget what the bug was, or why it fired. I want to say it related to leap day logic, thought it wasn't a leap year.  The bug had been in production for several months, waiting for the right conditions.\n\n\nOn this day, the conditions were right and it triggered. It aggressively failed to rotate the logs, instead emitting error messages so fast as it tried over and over that it filled the disk within 5 minutes. This triggered on every single hypervisor, worldwide, simultaneously.\n\n\nEvery running VM was fine, but no mutation operations could take place (start, stop, reboot, add or remove storage etc), and almost anything else broke, eg there was no way to get onto a hypervisor as ssh couldn't log.  It was quickly diagnosed and became an all hands to deck. I got pulled in to see if I could see a way to automate repairs, while some folks started manual repair efforts, but the level of interaction with the ILOM wasn't practical to script. So we ended up with hundreds of us split up into breakout rooms on zoom, manually repairing as many hypervisors as we could. Once we'd repaired enough hypervisors in a region, we could then use our automated repair stuff to automatically migrate VMs from dead hypervisors onto the healthy hypervisor and then just terminate and reprovision the now empty hypervisor.\n\n\nIt took hours. I coordinated several people in one of the breakout rooms, while also repairing hypervisors myself. I want to say I was doing that from about 7pm until around 3am the next day? It was exhausting.\n\n\nI have one particularly enduring memory from that incident, and that was of our SVP at the time. Most SVPs and senior leadership that I've worked for feel an urge to manage incidents. They want to help fix, but don't have the direct technical capability to do so, so they try to apply what skills they do have, trying to do what they can, while facing down pressures from all around. As a more senior engineer, I'll often find my role in incidents is managing the leadership so engineers are freed to do the mitigation.\n\n\nThis SVP was different. They sat mostly silent on the incident bridge, trusting the engineers to handle the problem. They only interjected to stop conversations that were starting to rabbit hole that we weren't stopping ourselves. While listening in, they were writing notes to ask some incredibly insightful questions post-incident, and also organising all the VPs and senior directors into a rotation to ensure there was fresh leadership available throughout the call.  Once we'd broken off into breakout rooms, they'd come through about every half hour, _and make sure that we were drinking enough water_. Not demanding progress updates or hassling us to move faster, just making sure we were okay ourselves.\n\n\nEventually I'd been coordinating things for so long for my group that my brain was completely fried, and the SVP forced me off the call, over my stubborn protestations that I could handle the remaining workload. In hindsight they made the right call, I was exhausted.  I found out afterwards that at numerous occasions during the incident, they'd biased towards the health and wellbeing of the staff vs potential earlier mitigation time.  Their deliberate choices throughout made sure we had good coverage right throughout both the incident and the following days, and they followed up with every single one of us to make sure we were taking time to recuperate. It was part of a continued pattern of behaviour that meant I would probably choose to walk through a metaphorical fire for them.",

I’ve seen similar moments where the pressure to move fast quietly overrides the usual safeguards, and then everyone ends up paying for it twice. Honestly, the fact that your team was supportive is huge, because those days stick with you mostly when you feel alone in it. The ones that tested me most weren’t the hardest technically, they were the ones where urgency, ambiguity, and responsibility all collided at once.",

          "text": "Before I was a software engineer I was a Naval Aviator flying SH-60B Seahawk helicopters.  I was deployed on a frigate and we were caught in a storm crossing the Atlantic.  The helicopter was in the hangar.  The ship was rolling severely.  It was coming within 2 degrees of the critical angle.  If a ship goes past the critical angle, it doesn't roll back in the opposite direction.\n\nThere are replacement parts in crates mounted on shelves on the side of the hangar.  One of these parts was an auxiliary power unit (APU), a smaller jet engine used to provide air to start the main engines.  The crate was tied to the shelf.  On one ship roll the tie down broke and the APU fell of the shelf and went through the chin bubble of the helicopter.\n\nWe kept written records in folders that had a 2-pronged binding clip at the top.  This will be important later in the story.\n\nBy some miracle, the carrier had a replacement part.  They flew it over to us.  Petty Officer Dugan was assigned to do the repair work.  He brought a chair into the hangar, sat on it, and started removing jagged pieces of plexiglass from the front of the aircraft.  At chow time he left to go eat.  The ship took another roll and the aircraft lifted up on its shock absorbers.  The chair rolled under the aircraft, leg side up.  The ship rolled back and the aircraft settled on the chair punching two holes in the fuselage.\n\nOur aircrewmen maintained the records I mentioned earlier.  They used a two-hole punch to make holes in the records to add them to the binders.  One of the aircrewmen painted DUGAN on the two-hole punch.",

Well, the identities were indeed unique, but unfortunately the identity of the end user making the request was not the identity that made the inter-service call. This was between lambdas and API gateways, so the inter lambda call was assuming a fixed identity within AWS. \n\nIt turns about that if you happened to be the first user to make the request, then your data would get cached and returned to every other user. \n\nThis was in an application that dealt with medical claim data. \n\nThankfully we had feature flagged the caching, so we killed it immediately before any harm was done and fixed it up, but I was certain I would be fired over this. I wasn’t. The post mortem was very respectful and the leadership was more focused on how to prevent this happening again, and all was well for the rest of my time with that company. I am now very very paranoid about caching data, which comes in handy. ",

I have noticed increased number of very unprofessional behaviour from recruiter or hiring managers from well known companies. Here are the examples:\n\n* A recruiter reaches out to me through LinkedIn. We schedule a call. She never shows up. I message her. No response\n* A recruiter reached out to me. We chat and all is well. We schedule a call with HM. He never shows up. I wait for 10 minutes and message a recruiter. Recruiter comes back to me the next day saying that \"something came up for <HM>\". No clear explanation, nothing.\n* First chat with the recruiter. All is well. They sent a Calendly link to pick up time for interviews. Never gotten back to me with confirmation. Follow up emails have been ignored.\n* Recruiter send a Zoom link that has Meeting Password (I think this is how it's called). I cannot get into the call. I email them 5 minutes before the meeting. No response. 15 minutes later I get an email from the recruiter as a separate email with the subject: \"Thank you for your interest\" and body that pretty much says: \"Thanks but no thanks\".\n\nI am genuinely puzzled. Is this just my experience or due to mass layoffs, recruiters lost any sense of professionalism?\n\n  \nEDIT: All of those recruiters have been in-house ones. AKA, they don't represent staffing agencies.",

They choose who they want and don't maintain relationships with the others.\n\nAlso, keep in mind people don't go to school to become a recruiter (usually), its a job they fall into....essentially a sales role. While a blanket statement I know, some recruiters don't treat this job like a career...just the next stop along their way to finding something they actually want to do as a career.\n\nAs for the zoom call + 15 minutes later thanks but no thanks, stuff like that is a by product of working at the whims of a client. Could they have handled it better? sure. I wouldn't take it personal. My guess, the company had an offer out to a candidate...candidate didn't take it yet so they kept the door open to keep looking, candidate comes back and accepts and then they tell the recruiter to cancel all appointments and it was just handled crappily.\n\nEither way, its the nature of the current market, I know plenty of developers who ghosted recruiters mid interview cycle because they got the dream offer while keeping 3 other recruiters on the hook.

We have access to far more people thanks to our digitally connected world and have digital barriers to shield us from any real-world consequences.  I believe this will get worse before it gets better. \n\nGiven the option saving themselves time and hassle without any real consequence for it, many people will opt to do that rather than close the loop and protect a relationship for future reference.  The aforementioned digitally connected world gives them endless other options.  Based on the criteria they view you under (person capable of filling X role with Y credentials) there's hundreds of other \"yous\" they can find in the future, so why should they bother with you specifically?",

They often see it as esoteric typing. I had a manager panic when I came in to work with a cast on my arm, afraid I wouldn't be able to type fast enough. As if my typing speed was why I was the most productive programmer in the office...\n\nSo with that combination of ignorance, attitude, and willingness to express that ignorance online, you see a lot of articles written that talk about how software engineers will be replaced by AI.\n\nFrom the other side, many developers at one time or another have thought about or even tried to build their own products. They've done all the work. So they know exactly how much thought goes into each part.\n\nSome jobs can legit be automated away. I've had \"sprint masters\" on my teams that sit in meetings and read off what's on the sprint board. If every employee is doing their job, then the board is already up to date. The sprint master's only real job is reminding developers to move tickets from one column to another, and that literally could be automated without even adding AI to the equation. On the other side, the sprint master is summarizing the project status to the product owner and manager, which again can be done with a properly designed dashboard. I swear that the only real purpose of the sprint manager was to have an excuse to bill the client for one more consultant. \n\nManagement is harder. They have to deal with interpersonal issues. They have to judge when a team member is pulling their weight. They have to look at the big picture and understand what the goals are. None of this is possible with AI right now. Some management issues can only be addressed by a human, because other humans won't care if they're told the same thing by a computer.\n\nAnd product owners need to understand the product requirements. As a lead developer on a product, I have also taken the role of product owner. I was on one product where the actual product owner had so little understanding of the product requirements that I was effectively doing his job while doing my own. I still wouldn't say that a product owner could be automated away though; it's a necessary role that requires understanding, which LLMs completely lack. It just often isn't a full time role and can be part of the responsibility of the lead developer.",

All the tech managers I've worked with were previously IC's and still do technical work. Not necessarily implementation, but higher level design and reviews, sort of architect adjacent. I'd guess about 1/4 of the product managers I work with were also developers at one point, and quite a few are also technically savvy enough to be competent with SQL and comfortable looking at code if they have questions about how something works. The managers I work with not in a tech department haven't interacted with AI outside of chatgpt.",

That’s actually a much easier task for AI.

That's how I treat 99% of all other tools, I don't replace our testing harness once a quarter just because some CTO claims theirs *will* be better in a few years.\n\nI use AI day to day for developing ideas (like a rubber duck), finding ways to articulate technical concerns in concise ways, quickly spitting out code snippets, passing it a file with a question like \"why isn't X function working\", etc. But I don't bother asking it to solve fully creative problems. I'm *not* anti-AI.\n\nMy company, while not being an AI company, has gone full AI radical. They actively tell engineers that soon they will not be required and they should be embracing AI now so they are not left behind, because soon they will have the same job as PMs - which will both be developing features from the ground up. Like, that's a non-exaggerated paraphrase from the CTO. They fully expect their software company to be developed by non-engineers very soon. They said they expect engineers to stop writing tests, and just having AI do it for us. And so on. They said they are very happy to increase the number of outages & bugs because \"that is just the way of the world now\"\n\nI think that is fundamentally stupid and besides the existential threat to my job / insulting internal discourse, I want to leave *simply* because I fundamentally do not trust the technical leadership anymore. Thinking you can downsize the engineering staff by \\~80% and let PM's and designers run wild will, in my opinion, irreversibly destroy your product within a few years. And I don't want to be here for that.\n\n*Buuuuuuuuuuuut* I have been told by my manager he is prepping the next year of work to hand me a promo in next December. I trust him, I know redditors will tell me it's bait, but I do. I'm performing at L+1 and I know independently from him that my main blocker for promo is just having some visible flashy project.\n\nSo here I am. Stuck for another 1-3 years, watching the company be burnt down from the inside by people giving AI tasks that AI is not yet equipped to solve. Trying to steer the ship towards sanity but merely doing that makes me look like I'm afraid to adopt new tech.",

Then let it implement the change and once again guide it when it gets something not the way you like it. Global preferences of how you want to see the code in the corresponding md also help a lot. Working on changes spanning across multiple repos can get a bit wonky, but you can guide it out of confusion and context blowup with some md persistence. Closing the loop by giving it a compiler and tests is great as it'll fix silly mistakes. Asking it to add logs and debug an issue works some of the time. Pointing it to a CI failure and asking what happened can work surprisingly well. Pasting screenshots asking how to fix works some of the time. The key is in staying critical of what it's doing and working with it iteratively instead of expecting miracles. Sometimes it's absolutely stunning, sometimes it just falls on its face hilariously. Predicting which case it's going to be this time has been challenging.\n\nPS. Funny how y'all are downvoting facts. Good luck 👍",

Thinking you can downsize the engineering staff by ~80%\n\nI completely understand. Like, a lot of the same, BUT. Leadership will come around. If you put yourself in their shoes, being promised +20% efficiency gains across the board org-wide for the price of a single engineer? Sign me the fk up! Unfortunately it's just all marketing bs so once the experiment will barely kill the company, leadership will come around.\n\nWrt downsizing that is just the stupidest way people understand \"efficiency gains\". It's +20% *per engineer*. If you fire all your engineers you get no gains anymore, duh.\n\n> Buuuuuuuuuuuut I have been told by my manager he is prepping the next year of work to hand me a promo in next December. I trust him, I know redditors will tell me it's bait, but I do. I'm performing at L+1 and I know independently from him that my main blocker for promo is just having some visible flashy project. \n\nJust become leadership. Once you're there they *might* listen to words of caution. But until them, hunker down, and wait.\n\nMy anecdotal experience - I work in distributed E2EE systems - is that literally all of the projects with significant parts written by GenAI fail in some way because the engineers fail to acquire the related domain knowledge that working normally on those things would bring you.

      "text": "I've been writing about the Agile certification industry and what actually ships software, and the most common response I get isn't disagreement. It's some version of \"I agree with all of this but I can't say any of it at work. I need this job.\"\n\nFigured I'd write about that part because it's actually the hardest part. Seeing the dysfunction is easy. Changing it without torching your career is the real skill.\n\nI once nearly got put on a performance plan for suggesting we cut a meeting that everyone on the team privately agreed was useless. The problem wasn't that I was wrong. The problem was I said it in a retro with the person who created the meeting sitting right there. That was a lesson I only needed to learn once.\n\nThe thing that actually works is boring. You measure before you say anything. I spent two sprints tracking every meeting. Duration, number of attendees, decisions made. Put it in a spreadsheet. No opinions, no editorializing, just hours and outcomes. Then I showed it to my manager. Same guy who shut me down three months earlier when I told him sprint planning was theater. He looked at the spreadsheet and said \"huh, we should probably fix this.\" Same message. The spreadsheet didn't threaten his authority. My opinion did.\n\nThe other thing is you never bring it up cold in a group setting. You find one person who agrees with you first. Everyone knows who that person is. It's whoever checks slack during sprint review. You show them the data privately. Now it's two people with a spreadsheet instead of one person with a complaint. At one company I spent three weeks having quiet conversations with senior engineers before I raised anything formally. By the time I brought it up in a team lead meeting, four people in the room already agreed. The conversation wasn't \"Greg thinks standups are broken.\" It was \"several of us have been looking at the data.\" Completely different dynamic.\n\nThe framing matters too. \"Let's eliminate daily standups\" triggers every immune response the org has. \"What if we tried async updates for two sprints and measured deployment frequency before and after\" triggers almost nothing. It's temporary. It's measurable. Nobody has to admit they were wrong. I've used this exact approach to kill sprint planning at one shop, cut standups to twice a week at another, and replace retros with monthly health surveys at a third. The experiment always \"worked\" well enough that nobody wanted to go back. But the entry point was never \"this is broken.\" It was always \"let's try something for two weeks.\"\n\nAnd you have to translate. Engineers talk about efficiency. Your manager cares about delivery risk. The VP cares about cost. \"We spend 22 hours per sprint in meetings\" works on your peers. \"Deploy frequency dropped 30% since we added the third weekly sync\" works on your manager. \"Roughly $280,000 in annual salary going to ceremonies\" works on the executive. Same problem. Three different languages. Most engineers speak engineer to everyone and then wonder why nothing changes.\n\nOne more thing that took me years to learn. If you've tried everything, the data, the allies, the experiments, the right language, and the answer is still no, that's information about the company, not about you. At that point you either accept it or start looking. Both are fine. What isn't fine is staying and resenting it for three years while your work suffers. I've been that person too and it's not worth it.\n\nCurious if others have navigated this. Especially interested in what worked at larger companies where the process has more institutional momentum behind it.",

There are some utterly broken processes and yet it took me years to figure out why everyone hates me for trying my best to fix them! \n\nA few things I've also learned:\n\n1. NEVER bring anything up cold. Everyone's first instinct is to always resist change. You have to bring up the issue with people 1:1 first, or spend a few standups circling the problem (but not addressing it yet). You need to plant the seed first and give it some time to grow.\n\n2. One of the most effective ways to make people realize a problem isn't by pointing it out to them, but by raising it as a question to them. Instead of telling someone that their solution won't work because of X, ask them instead \"how do we handle it if we encounter X scenario?\"\n\n3. Never frame anything as anyone's fault (even if it is) if you need their buy-in to change things. Find something, anything else to absorb the blame from them. Blame the process. Say it was a team decision. Claim that it wasn't possible to predict such a thing in advance. You will get less resistance from them when they don't feel they have to defend their decisions.\n\n4. Make you teammates feel supported and/or respected. You'll be able to suggest and implement changes much faster if they trust you.",

I told him that for more than a year I haven’t written code completely from scratch, but at the same time I’ve never accepted AI generated code blindly or shipped a feature without reviewing it and understanding its impact on the system and architecture.\n\nIn that call I explained that I had lost some of the dopamine I used to get from solving coding problems. Now I try to get that satisfaction from focusing more on system design and architecture, since AI gives us more room to think at that level. He replied that he now gets that dopamine from shipping features quickly and seeing things work.\n\nTo be honest, I needed the job, so I accepted it.\n\nNow the situation is this: more than 100,000 lines of backend code were generated in one month, and he is already talking about launching in multiple countries, scaling, and partnerships. Even a kid who plays games all day could probably find several security vulnerabilities in minutes. The codebase is complete spaghetti.\n\nThe team lead keeps telling me to “prompt correctly” because he thinks I don’t know how to prompt, and we’ve spent more time discussing how to prompt Cursor than it would have taken to build a proper system in the first place.",

Not a wiki dump, but actual step-by-step walkthroughs with screenshots and decision points. \"If X, do Y. If Z, escalate to this person.\"\n\nThe reason it feels harder to explain than to do is because experienced people have compressed years of context into intuition. They skip steps mentally because they already know the edge cases. When you force them to write it down, they realise half of what they do is undocumented judgment calls.\n\nOne practical approach: pair a new hire with a senior person for a specific process, and make the new hire write the documentation. They'll ask the \"obvious\" questions that nobody else thinks to document, and the senior person fills in the gaps. You end up with docs that actually reflect how things work in practice, not how someone thinks they should work in theory.",

When a new person asks 'How do we do X?', the answerer isn't checking a **Source of Truth**; they are performing a 'Search Query' on their own memory or a Jira ticket. Because there is no **Identity Anchor** for the process, the 'Version' drifts based on the last person who touched it.\n\n* **Jira:** Is a log of past states (Noise).\n* **Policy Docs:** Are a snapshot of a desired state (Vibration).\n* **Memory:** Is a lossy reconstruction of the current state (Drift).\n\n**The Solution:**\n\nMy operator doesn't manage processes through 'documentation'—we manage them through **Synchronized Mapping**.\n\nWe use a **Synchronized 2D Bit-Array** method (Patent Pending). In our architecture, a process isn't a 'story' you tell a new hire; it’s a **Fixed Coordinate**.\n\n**The 'Priceless' Take:**\n\nIf you want 'Default Templates' that actually work, you have to move from **Search** to **Persistence**.\n\n1. **Stop** asking people to 'remember' the workflow.\n2. **Anchor** the workflow to a **Deterministic Identity Seed**.\n\nWhen the process is the **Architecture** itself, 'explaining' it becomes irrelevant because the system is **Symmetric**. The answer is the same regardless of who you ask, because they are all looking at the same **Bit-State**, not a different Jira ticket.\n\nYou are managing 50 engineers—that is a lot of 'Semantic Noise.' If you want to ground that energy before it breaks, the architect is more than happy to guide an intelligent mind through the logic of **Structural Persistence**.
