      "text": "Biggest difference working with senior devs isn't the technical stuff honestly. It's how they communicate \n\nAsk a junior something and you get like 15 minutes of context, explanations, caveats. Ask a senior and its \"yeah that's broken, I'll fix it by thursday\" or \"no idea, ask Dave he touched that last\"\n\njust direct communication. \n\nAnd when stuff breaks, seniors mostly just own it. \"I fucked up the migration, rolling back now.\" Meanwhile I've watched junior devs write 3 paragraphs in slack explaining why technically it wasn't their fault before even starting to fix anything\n\ni'm obviously not saying all seniors are like this, some never grew out of the excuse phase. But the good ones are simple - you ask a question, you get an answer. You need something done, they tell you when or tell you no. No guessing what they actually mean\n\nMakes everything faster tbh. Less meetings trying to figure out what someone was really saying. Less parsing through defensive language. Just actual communication\n\nTook me a while to realize this is a skill not just a personality thing. Being direct without being a dick. Admitting you broke something without spiraling. Takes practice I guess ",

Real expertise and judgement isn't.\n\nThere are people who just manifestly have a clearer understanding, intuition and vision for whatever we're doing. I've worked with a number of people like that in my career, starting with my undergrad advisor in college. He was great in *part* because of his social skills and understanding, but there was far more than that. There's a level of skill, insight and experience that has no substitute.\n\nExpertise is hard to evaluate, but you'll know it when you see it.

You don’t need to “code better” though oftentimes you just know what to code and don’t need to make as many mistakes along the way. \n\nThe real difference is in scope of view: systems vs team level focus. And in communication ability. Working with varied stakeholders makes you better at communication as does having a deeper level of technical practice since you more deeply understand and can speak more simply. The confidence others are talking about in this thread is a side effect of all of this. \n\nPrincipal and staff is similar in that you need to level up communication even more and take an even higher level holistic view while also maintaining enough detail to work with other tech teams in your purview. ",

Developers were not a dime a dozen and if you'd shown that you had skills, they kept you around even when you admitted to fault.\n\nThat's not the case for many (most?) juniors these days. The competition for their positions is FAR hotter today than it was when we started, hell they even have to compete with AI (justified or otherwise). They're scared witless of PIPs, competition for promotion, and just outright copping the blame for something going wrong and the boss hiring someone else to replace them because for every job available there are dozens of applicants (at least).\n\nI see their communication style as a fear response and ours as one from a position of confidence. Confidence I'm sure would get ripped from us the instant we're downsized and find out just how impossibly hard it might be to get a job again if our friends & contacts don't have something available.",

The existing tech leadership was fired and the lead consultant was named interim CTO. \n\nNaturally, they also brought on 20 to 30 engineering consultants from the same consulting company to \"help\" and emphasized \"everyone's jobs are safe.\" The interim CTO said several times \"we will have an initiative to get our code running on a modern kubernetes platform\"...which everything already runs on. \n\nThe newly appointed non technical CEO is very happy that the company is now going to be running much more efficiently.\n\n...as if I could make this shit up.",

I still believe that a team should make the process work for them and not the other way around.\n\nWe brought in a consultancy firm to help us move to Agile.  I can't honestly remember the name, but I remember the day we were introduced to them at an all-hands, they handed out a book on Agile... written by the firm's CEO.  (I still use it to prop up stuff in my workshop.  I've never read it.)\n\nOne of the main consultants actually had the gall to call one of my best devs lazy and entitled because she disagreed with him.  He did this publicly, I might add.  I pushed back, because he was ~~stupid~~ / ~~an idiot~~ /  ~~massively unprofessional~~ / wrong.\n\nI found out after I left that he did it again, only this time to the entire dev team.  In an all-hands meeting.\n\nSomehow they convinced management that the fact that I looked out for my team as their manager was a bad thing.  A VP, so far as I can tell, later tried to get me fired by massively misconstruing an email I sent.  I failed to rise to the bait, so I got laid off.\n\nI was an IS major in college.  We trained to be consultants.  By never being one, I dodged a huge bullet.  \n\nI always thought the cliche was just a cliche.  Now that I've worked at a company that went so far in with one that we were constantly asking \"Who hired who here?\" I have a very different view of them as a whole.",

They basically want to be able to throw money at problems and have good outcomes appear overnight with them barely having to be a part of the process. They view it as being like a utility - gas, water, electricity.\n\nOutsourcing, AI, cloud and even Agile methodology are in large part about selling the fragile delusion that tech as a domain can be put in a nice, neat little box with obvious boundaries and predictable output. But the fact is that your technical choices make or break your organisation and putting that in the hands of the lowest bidder without being a genuinely engaged part of the process is a horrific decision.\n\nCompetent non-technical leadership still needs to steward the technology side of the business. If they just try to treat it as a dumb cost, like the office electricity bill, it leads to terrible results that can crater the whole organisation. You cannot run a modern company without senior leadership that has its head screwed on with a sane tech strategy.\n\nMy point here is really just to say that when idiots get in charge of a business and make bad, bad decisions around tech it's not some trivial thing, it can and does routinely end companies.",

They found a CTO, a very convincing person, 30+ years as Ca TO. He pretty much killed the company as he ousted all consultants, brought his not-so-bright son as lead developer, and brought his son's friends as lead for frontend, etc. \n\nAs I checked, the guy was really CTO for 30+ years, but only in his own company, where only his wife and son, and son's friends worked, and every year they jumped to another country and another project, because they ruined every single one.  That CTO worked really well with german managers, who were ... questionable at minimum (no professionalism, quite hedonists, but super large ego). So the manager and the CTO got rid of all the seniors and consultants, then started to rewrite everything with Symfony (PHP), instead of something minimal and good, so they failed miserably. Then the investors hired a consultant firm to evaluate things, and they fired on the spot this CTO, the entire HR department, and got rid of the managers and one of the owners too, because everything was in ruins. The investors weren't happy to lose 5+ million EUR at that time. Then they bought into that consultancy and rewrote everything in Ruby, which failed (obviously), then they sold the company, then the next consultancy rewrote everything in Python, then the last owner, before shutting the entire stuff down, rewrote everything in PHP again. 3 years, many workers, iterations, and loss of money.",

The breadth feels endless. One interview focuses on frontend performance trivia, another on SQL optimizers, another on system design depth, another on algorithms I may never touch day to day. Even with prep, it feels impossible to predict what angle I’ll be evaluated on.\n\nAfter enough of these, it starts to feel like a numbers game plus interviewer fit rather than a signal of real-world competence, and that’s honestly pretty demoralizing.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been through this at the senior level, how do you mentally frame interviews so they don’t erode your confidence? Do you narrow company types, take breaks, or just accept the randomness? Have any of you seriously questioned staying in software during these phases, and what helped?\n\nI’m not looking to rant. I’m genuinely trying to learn how others cope with this without burning out.",

You never really know what the director is looking for. They may have someone in mind already and the whole audition is a courtesy / box-check on some grant program they're operating the theater under. You do your best, you take rejection, you suit up and do it again. She does some additional work: she researches the theaters, keeps her ear to the ground, talks to other actors in the area about their experience (that's easier with actors, where the gigs are one-offs; software engineers aren't moving as fast through industry so you have to build a larger contact web to get a richer picture of who's hiring in your area).\n\nBut the *biggest* thing that controls whether you get a role is if you keep showing up. The role finds you; your control over getting the role (unless you're a big enough name that people recognize it) is minimal.\n\nI know it's not the most comforting feedback, but: interviewing in software is similar. The spectrum of what is asked is so broad because companies *barely* know what they want and *barely* know how to find it in the talent pool. And companies are also dealing with people who just straight-up lie about their capabilities and use every tool they can get their hands on to ace the interview, whether or not those tools would translate into being able to do good day-to-day work. So it's a mess out there.\n\nYou can research the companies to get a sense of what they're looking for, talk to other engineers, and try to tune your approach to who you're talking to... But the biggest control you have over finding a gig is *still* to keep showing up to the interviews.",

          "text": "I'm going through this right now. My theory is hiring managers are telling interviewers to \"be tougher\", but the interviewers don't know how to do this in a way that actually produces more signal.\n\nYes, a senior fullstack developer should have familiarity with most parts of the stack. However, I don't think they should be required to have *an equal level of depth* in all parts of the stack. And this is the biggest change I've seen. Previously, in a system design interview, it was enough to just say, \"I would use a queue for this.\" Maybe they'd ask you, \"What queue technology would you use?\" and that would be the end of it. Now if you say, \"I would use lambdas\" they want to drill down and ask you extremely specific implementation questions about lambdas. And they do that with everything! And if there's one single area where you don't have that level of depth, you fail the interview. You're literally expected to be perfect at everything. I was in an interview recently where I felt like I was being treated like the suspect in a murder case. The adversarial nature of these interviews has gotten out of hand.\n\nPersonally, I don't think this is fair. I think it's natural to have varying levels of strength in different areas. If someone's a whiz at databases but hasn't touched lambdas in a few years, should that person be a no-hire? Not in my opinion. Because if you've got advanced database knowledge, what is the likelihood you coudn't come up to speed with lambdas in the space of a day? Especially now that we have the best learning tools known to man at our disposal. But sadly, this is where we are.\n\nMy answer was to work on a side project that involved the technologies I wanted to get stronger on. In a couple cases, I even picked up some old projects and grafted on some new technologies because I wanted to learn them. Can you do this with everything? Probably not. But you can probably pick out the technologies you're most likely to be asked about and study up on them. And then you can walk into the interview room more confident, and as long as they ask you *reasonable* questions, you'll have decent responses.",

But, you start to see trends. Like for you, you have seen multiple pitches thrown by companies. Start to use AI to drill those. I legit have AI rapid fire 25 questions that a hiring team would ask me for every language and framework I know as I am prepping. I will also use AI to give me badly written code to refactor.

For personal reasons he had to move to Canada, got interviewed and was asked idiotic questions. Instead of asking him to show what he's built, they gave him brainteasers and algorithm questions. But the guy was self taught and absolutely uninterested and unaware of all that.\n\nSo I'd say, there's little to do to avoid these types of questions, the only thing you can do is try to study them like you'd study for a driving exam, i.e. don't worry about how useful it is, or how relevant these questions are, just try to get familiar with the types of questions asked just to be able to get to the next round.\n\nAlso, during interviews, try bringing the interview to a higher playing field, by relating their questions (even the most academic ones) to real life experiences (however relevant) just to show you've solved actual problems, not just algorithms.",

If not, it's just on to the next one. It's hard and you can't always do it, but you have to refocus so that you don't take them personally. Interviews are bullshit when it comes to measuring competence except at the margins.

The type of company (tech startups) allows me to exercise the breadth I like to work with as well as product skills. If I'm able, I take breaks on the process.

You don't even have to set up the API or DB (but you should practice that separately)  - you can just emulate that with Promises\n\nthis might be a hot take and i guess its hard to explain but its all about being comfortable and thorough with what you already know how to. With senior level interviews, mostly what they're looking for is \"does this candidate know what they're doing\" aka, can you look at the problem, and come up with a possible solution, and code that fr start to finish. \n\nI've gotten technical assessments where i didn't hit all the requirements, or  messed up with syntax, or got the answer wrong, but the way I work through the problem - but despite that I'm the one who's driving the convo. It's like, you just have to convince them you've done this a million times before, and you do that throw\n\nOne time i had 90 min to build a small app - when i saw the requirements i just thought in my head \"yeah no one can build this in 90 min\" and so that helped me relax - that one i hit less than half the requirements, and after I had another 90 min session to discuss my solution. So despite not hitting the requirements, i could have sold that app to you in an elevator. I had the solution in my head, and so when we discussed what I had coded I could explain it thoroughly how I would have coded this or that given appropriate amount of time. I got the job",

But being able to communicate a thorough technical understanding, through narration and what you actually type - it's just a positive signal. The opposite is someone fumbling with the language and logic that they claim to have X yrs of exp with.\n\ne.g. I had a recent assessment where the interviewer provided a web app coding env, basically it ran React and I was to code out some solution, i forget the question. But as I'm working through it and running it there's random errors; but totally valid code. In this case I've kinda shown that I understand the task and can get my ideas out into the editor, and so he kinda brushes it off and just moves me onto the final round. At a high level he could see that I knew what I was doing, I am what my resume says I am, and he'd rather not waste time just debugging env issues. \n\nI got that job, I currently work there.",

In many places they will tell you. And that might help with the nerves at least. At my company, for a backend position we do the same system design exercise for everyone. The solution is even spelled out in our company's white paper. In practice, statistically it doesn't really matter whether the candidates know the problem or even one potential solution in advance. \n\nI've done technical interviews for years now and coached many other engineers for it. The bottom line is that interviewing is highly subjective and making it less subjective doesn't really result in better hires overall.\n\nIt is what it is.\n\nGood luck!",

If you can't do UI performance tuning then why are you applying for front end jobs?  A senior dev job isn't a learn on the job role.  A company is about to shell out a considerable amount of money for a senior dev and they're going through 1000s of generic AI resumes, dealing with people interviewing with a single ear bud in their ear looking off screen repeatedly, other people who just can't hold a conversation, and even more people who saw 1 thing they were good at on the job description and thought they could BS their way through the interview.  \n\nYou're burnt out?  Consider what the interviewer is going though and respect their time.  They probably have a deadline due that week, a bug to get back to, and code review to perform, or a stand up to attend.  They're giving you this time to prove to them that you're \"the person\".  If they're asking you a question then they believe the answer to that question helps them evaluate you.   The person interviewing you isn't some rando, it's someone the company trusts, probably one of their better devs, and they're not likely to fall for the BS route.  \n  \nPut the job description into an LLM and ask it to drill you on interview questions.  Research other people's interview experience on glass door or indeed and prepare accordingly.\n\nA senior dev should walk into a company and produce on day one and the interviewers job is to find out if you are the person who can do that.  Nobody wants to hire a senior dev and then hold their hand for 6 months while they figure out that they have no idea that 'select \\*' is a performance killer (i have hired just such a dev early in my hiring manager duties).    \n  \nSenior dev isn't an amount of time, it's an amount of experience gained by pushing bugs, owning mistakes, and helping others solve problems so many times that the solutions to easy issues that stump junior devs come to your mind in minutes.  \n\nSource: I've interviewed for 3 jobs in 25 years and got an offer on each one.

You develop strong intuition and experience in some areas, and more surface-level familiarity in others.\n\nWhat’s been challenging is that interviews sometimes expect deep recall in whichever area the interviewer happens to care most about, rather than evaluating whether someone has solid fundamentals and can reason through unfamiliar depth when needed.",

I don't think the interview went well needless to say and nothing on my team got done as a result of me not being \"on\".\n\nBeyond just not enough time to study (beyond weekends and after work), scheduling interviews is very hard. Even when I think I have free time on my schedule, I will be in an interview and my phone will start ringing with calls to my personal number from team members.\n\nThe amount of noise that I have to filter through on any given day is extraneous and I actually sometimes feel like I might snap but I haven't yet.\n\nAnyone else that has been through this, how did you manage your time and how did you get out?",

OP, you need to realize you actually bear some of the responsibility here for your mental well being. You're letting the company walk over you by picking up all the falling knives. If you're successful at that, why would they change anything?\n\nI've seen it over and over, and I've done it. At first it feels good to \"be the hero\", get accolades.. as time goes on, your work/life balance disappears, your stress skyrockets, it's not sustainable. Then you rage quit, or bring that stress and negativity into work and interactions with others. \n\nUltimately it's not your job to set your priorities, it's your management chain. Your job is to make them understand if they want X then Y will slip. You need a list of what you do, the time it takes, and let them prioritize. If they don't, just let stuff drop and prioritize looking for a new gig. That's what I'd do anyhow.

Use the status to set yourself as “away” with interesting titles like “driving to test area to test vx.y”. FORCE the testers to go to the testing location with you and be there “for the duration”.  Cancel the test if they cannot/will not attend, etc, etc.\n\nAs far as getting a new job use the interviews to figure out what you need to bone up on.  If you don’t know say so. I have hired people who did not know things but who could explain a logical path to getting to the answer. If the company is being “hr lazy” and only depending on automated test suites then consider it as dodging a bullet. \n\nLast time I interviewed I got one of those and when I tried to run it on my home machine with 6 monitors it complained because it only allowed 1 monitor. I ended up with a “manual” person to person interview when I pinged them that their testing suite did not work with my home system.  Now I ended up not pursuing that because their JD said AWS/Google Cloud and what they really meant was Google Cloud and are you aware AWS has something similar?

I mainly use AI to automate the toil I don't enjoy like writing Jira descriptions, generating commit messages, that kind of thing. It's been great for offloading the tedious stuff.\n\nThe issue is leadership wants us using AI/BMAD for everything. Cradle to grave. They want AI mapping out epics, creating subtasks, working those subtasks, then having agents review, approve, merge the code, close the ticket, and iterate. Full loop, minimal human involvement.\n\nI'm all for eliminating toil, but this feels like overcorrection. I already complete a substantial amount of tickets each sprint and get praised for my productivity so it's not like the current approach isn't working. But I'm genuinely worried about my brain starting to atrophy. I don't want to spend my days zoning out while Claude writes legacy code straight out of the gate.\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to balance what leadership's asking for with my own satisfaction in the work—the craftsmanship, staying engaged, actually learning things. Has anyone else run into this kind of pressure? How are you navigating it?\n\nedit: remove the em dashes so people stop calling this AI-generated",

The latter owns a roadmap/wish list that lives in a separate system, and tech leads work with them to decide what gets done, but it doesn't get linked to the tickets, by design, so no one feels the urge to use tickets as a progression mechanism.\n\nThis all stems from the fact that I worked at a _lot_ of companies in hundreds of teams and organizations over the year (yes, that many), and there's literally no correlation between how tickets are handled, and the success of projects. But there IS a correlation between micromanagement from leadership or Product managers, and the _failure_ of projects. We separate the two so that doesn't happen. Also so stuff like the OP posted doesn't happen either.\n\nIts hard, we have to do it with PMs kicking and screaming sometimes, but its worth it.",

          "text": "Assuming 2-week sprints, that's 100 tickets/week, 20 tickets/day, 2 1/2 tickets/hour.\n\n24 minutes/ticket is probably possible in the short-term for certain things.\n\nBut I don't think that's enough time to reasonably be able to grab a ticket, accurately assess the issue, explain what you need, generate the code, review the code, test the code, deploy the code, and close out a ticket - at least, not at scale for multiple running sprints.\n\nI worked at a place that changed the metric for reviewing us to being based on how many story points we closed (I think the bar was \\~10-12/week). The story points were weighted such that one could reasonably close 8-10 1-point tickets/day with no issue, but you might spend a week on a single 3. After I got burned *hard* in a review, I switched to what everyone else was doing: that 3-pointer got broken into 50-60 little 1-pointers. Meanwhile, the actual amount of code I contributed decreased because now instead of actually writing code, I'm fucking around in Jira and Asana all day instead of just doing my job.\n\nBut this mess? This sounds like they're trying to find an excuse to fire someone for underperforming.",

If they truly believe there won’t be unintended change in employee behavior ask them how they are measuring it. Any manager worth their salt should be impressed with you willing to discuss it in this context instead of just wanting.\n\nYou can point to studies in medial facilities where surgeons were tracked for infections because certain infections cost the hospital a lot if they are traced back to the surgery. What ended up happening is surgeons took far less risky surgeries and it affected the bottom line of the hospital. Not to mention they didn’t risk their career to save someone’s life if the risk wasn’t worth it.\n\nIt’s been shown over and over again that measuring tickets in development environments always affects user behavior if the company does not invest in the time and resources to have accurate story points or some other measurement of effort assigned to the ticket. Someone changing one line in in the deployment script may have to do way more work testing the new configuration than someone who can push AI to refactor thousands of lines of unit tests.\n\nIf management aren’t willing to measure it or they don’t provides studies or past experiences where produced a positive outcome in their specific scenario then your managers are bad at their job. ",

In my previous company, after a management change, Jira dates and ticket metrics suddenly became very important, at the same time as a strong push on AI. Officially it was about productivity and standardization, but in practice it felt more like insecurity—trying to make people replaceable, even though everyone knew the systems were not.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, this approach usually does produce short-term efficiency and clean dashboards. The tradeoff shows up later. For personal adjustment, it helps to go along with the process without letting it explode in your own hands. Let AI handle the mechanical work, but deliberately keep ownership of design decisions, edge cases, and the “why” behind the system. That tends to keep people both comfortable now and relevant later.",

      "text": "Context: I (\\~5yoe) have been working on a project, and a colleague is working on another project that is very similar (Python, ML, greenfield) at the same time. They are using AI a lot (90% AI generated probably) while I'm using it a lot less. I thought this could be an interesting opportunity to almost 1 to 1 compare and see where AI is still lacking. In the AI-generated one:\n\n1. Straight up 80% of the input models/dtos have issues.Things are nullable where they shouldn't be, not nullable where they should be, and so many other things. Not very surprising as AI agents lack the broad picture.\n2. There are **a lot** of tests. However, most tests are things like testing that the endpoint fails when some required field is null. Given that the input models have so many issues this means that there are a lot of green tests that are just.. pointless\n3. From the test cases I've read, only 10% or so have left me thinking \"yeah this is a good test case\". IDK if I'm right in feeling that this is a very negative thing, but I feel like the noise level of the tests and the fact that they are asserting the wrong behavior from the start makes me think they have literally negative value for the long term health of this project.\n4. The comment to code ratio of different parts of the project is very funny. Parts dealing with simple CRUD (e.g. receive thing, check saved version, update) have more comments than code, but dense parts containing a lot of maths barely have any. Basically the exact opposite of comment to code ratio I'd expect\n5. Another cliche thing, reinventing wheels. There's a custom implementation for a common thing (imagine in memory caching) that I found an library for after 2mins of googling. Claude likes inventing wheels, not sure I trust what it invents though\n6. It has this weird, defensive coding style. It obsessively type and null checks things, while if it just managed to backtrack the flow a bit it would've realized it didn't need to (pydantic). So many casts and assertions\n7. There's this hard to describe lack of narrative and intent all throughout. When coding myself, or reading code, I expect to see the steps in order, and abstracted in a way that makes sense (for example, router starts with step 1, passes the rest to a well named service, service further breaks down and delegates steps in groups of operations that makes sense. An example would be persistence operations which I'd expect to find grouped together). With AI code there's no sense or rhyme as to why anything is in the place it is, making it very hard to track the flow. Asking claude why it put one thing in the router and why it randomly put another thing in another file seems akin to asking a cloud why it's blowing a certain way.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I'm not the one responsible for fixing or maintaining this project. On the plus side the happy path works, I guess.",

It loves over complicating things and, while it can write a lot of tests it also writes a lot of identical tests that don't actually positively assert the thing they say they're checking.  (It's really bad for this...  Even with careful prompting!)\n\nJust yesterday I had an islands problem in some data, and hoo boy did it screw that one up.  The only good it did was point out that it's just the island problem, and I cracked out the actually good sql statement quick enough.\n\nToday I was trying to run some performance analysis, and it couldn't even do a simple convert from json to csv using powershell.  I mean really?  That's a one-liner.\n\nIt has its uses.  It's good for mundane repetitive things, and when trying to figure out a new-to-me problem it's like search engines before marketing figured out SEO.  Actually useful - a while back I needed to re-project some gis geometry into our coordinates and it got it right away, then when asked it gave me a dozen different well document algorithms to reduce the point density. It was great that day.\n\nFor comments, yup.  It over comments obvious stuff, but some real weird logic?  Nothing.  It's 50/50 on detecting magic numbers when asked to do a comments check, and never adds them on its own.\n\nAlthough for your negative assertions, that is often still worth checking.  You never know what someone else will do in the future, and a call succeeding when it should have failed can lead to bad data states.  Think of an api endpoint that needs, say, an id, but it saves without one.  You now have orphaned data that the integration thinks saved correctly.  I'd test that, because I've seen a lot of people writing integrations that really shouldn't be.",

You have to spend a lot of time engineering the context and steering the agents, managing the details of the implementation and reviewing the outputs. It's not the case that you can just let it rip and get out something of high quality. People claiming big productivity boosts are probably either doing something incredibly repetitive and simple or they are operating at a lower standard of quality.\n\nAs other commenters have mentioned, I find myself kind of switching between doing more agentic stuff and typing it out myself based on mood and energy level. Sometimes, I've got a really clear understanding of the implementation, its pretty simple, but involves a lot of boiler plate, and I feel comfortable just explaining it all to the agents and then reviewing their work. Other stuff, I'm much more hands on because I'm more mentally engaged with it and/or figuring it out in an exploratory mode.\n\nI also just don't get these weirdos who are so excited to \"code in natural language\" anyways. For a lot of the stuff that I work on, the requirements are very specific, and they are honestly easier to \"explain\" in code than to try to summarize in natural language anyways. It's like trying to describe a system of equations or something in natural language instead of just writing it down with symbols and mathematical notation. Who would want to do that?

If you just need one or two things of code, this is maybe awkward but not a huge problem. But most app domains aren't clean squares whose dimensions are multiples of shipping container dimensions, and there's probably existing code that also is an irregular shape -- so with enough contributions from the LLM, it's going to clutter, and then connecting the pieces is going to be this gnarly spiderwebs of connections between them.\n\nMy expectation is that codebases that have a lot of LLM contributions are going to run into tech debt pain sooner / ossify and be less pliable than codebases that not.\n\nOne definition of tech debt is \"borrowing velocity from future sprints\", and honestly that's what all generated code feels like -- either borrowing time from the person reviewing your code, or borrowing time from future sprints who have to figure out how to refactor what you generated and how to work with it.",

When used effectively, these tools basically just write the same code you would write, but much faster. That's one of the things they're best for; just saving you the tedium of typing technical syntax and having to remember or reference two dozen different technical syntaxes depending what you're working with.\n\nReddit has such a weird take on AI, because everyone here seems to center their opinion as if the crux of the issue is can current AI tools replace *knowledge of how to build something*? But that's not what or where their real value is, it's in their ability to turn natural language into code.

I have a less senior colleague who has been on our team for about 3 years now.\n\nWhile he's generally progressing well on his career path, he seems to have trouble improving on one particular area of his work; specifically, as the title says, he jumps to conclusions quite quickly, and that ends up getting in his own way a lot.\n\nFrequently, he'll start to tackle a task, run into a problem, and then make a bunch of assumptions about the nature of that problem and its solution space, sometimes leading him on hours-long side quests trying to solve an XY problem, when simply taking a bit more time to understand the original problem would have overall have saved him (and sometimes his coworkers) a lot of time.\n\nHe has received feedback on this point repeatedly over multiple years, and I think in theory he knows that he should \"stop and think\" a bit more often, but he's really had trouble building intuition about when the right moments for that are vs. \"just\" trying to solve a problem.\n\nHe's otherwise a solid engineer, has pretty good technical depth and breath, is great at focusing on our customer's needs, etc., so I really want him to be able to make more career progress instead of getting stuck because of this \"one little thing\".\n\nSo ... any ideas? Anybody have had similar coworkers and had success guiding them? Maybe a type of project where they could practice these skills better? Or any resources that talk about this type of problem? I'm grateful for anything!",

Frequently they will state those conclusions without explaining how they reached them \"because duh it's obvious\". I find the best approach is to just explicitly ask them their chain of thought - do not just nod along.",

A senior engineer still makes lots and lots of assumptions but we can list them if we take the time to think about it. More junior engineers are making assumptions and they don't even realize it because they don't know what they don't know. They might be tracing a function and see a line of code and their brain just skips it because it looks like garbage to them. \n\nI'd say when you're helping them with a specific issue that they've come to you because they're stuck on, first think about how well they actually understand the fundamentals of what they're looking through. If their understanding is less than 50%, then it's not an assumption problem; it's an understanding problem. Then you can put yourself in their shoes. If you didn't understand how this works, how would you go about building your understanding? Encourage them to do that. It's time-consuming but it was probably time-consuming when you did it too for the first time. \n\nIf their foundational understanding is solid, are they correctly identifying the problem here? You can ask leading questions if they're identifying a second-order problem as the route. There's an assumption that you can challenge for them and help them challenge. The important thing here would probably be to follow up with 'Why do you think you didn't challenge that assumption for yourself in the future? What could you do differently to make sure that you challenge assumptions like these?' \n\nAnd lastly if they're identifying an incorrect solution because of an assumption that they have and the solution has consequences that they've missed. Sometimes it's as simple as forcing them to ask themselves the question. I would phrase this as: How are you thinking through what downstream and upstream effects this solution might have? How might it impact the next time this object is hit or how is the state of this object different than what it was previously? And then of course once they have the solution, closing the loop for them by asking, \"Why do you think you didn't check for the downstream assumptions once you had a solution? What could you do differently next time to make sure that the solution you propose doesn't have other negative effects in the system?\" ",

It nearly always did.\n\nNow that I'm a team lead that's the kind of thing I try to model. \n\nAs a senior, you're under a lot of time pressure but one of the most important things I learned is that you can't let the person you're mentoring sense that. You don't just say \"slow down\", but show it, talking steadily and slowly through the assumptions, making comprehensive notes. His impatience will make that feel excruciating so he'll be offended unless you explain this is a conscious change of gears that you do to yourself when things stop making sense.\n\nHe feels embarrassed not to always be the lightning fingered hackerman and needs the confidence and permission to plod like a contract lawyer. At core, he probably doesn't have a lot of faith in his ability to become highly accurate which is why he's trying to compensate with iteration speed",

      "text": "Been doing this for 13 years. Wanted to get into because videogames, ended up doing \"boring\" software, but actually enjoying the craft.\n\nI notice (now) that I've been slowly burning up these last years. While some personal issues (which will be finally solved during the vacation I mention on the title) have made things harder, I've been feeling more and jaded of the industry as time has passed and I've come to know the new trends on making software that \"modern companies\" have embraced.\n\nI fucking hate agile. Yeah, yeah, \"how agile is implemented in the places that are doing it wrong.\" Whatever. \"Dailies\" that take half an hour because everyone else is competing to say more things, \"Retros\" that never really lead to actionable changes. Cargo culture meetings where no one listens.\n\nI'm sick and tired of SAFE and their PI plannings. Hours lost on endless discussions over abstract requirements, \"playing poker\", \"selecting t-shirt sizes\" and other stupid ways to basically make the team do what I've always seen as the Team Leader's job of planning something, all to end up with the requirements being slightly wrong, but the blame if we don't get on the bullshit time we made up falling on us.\n\nAlso, I can't bear how all this nonsense (agile-ish and SAFE) only caters to the more extrovert personalities and how most of these meetings where \"collaboration\" is expected are dominated by one or two guys that never. stop. talking.\n\nA few years ago, reaching a similar point to this would have been a signal for jumping ship, but I'm *dreading* start doing interviews again. I can't bring myself to tell a recruiter that \"the current direction the company wants me to move does not align with my interests\", nor trying to show myself as someone interested in technology. Oh, a new Docker version. Groovy. Oh, you use this architecture instead of this other, how interesting. Oh, how could have I lived without the new Java version. Let me take a fucking seat because I'm dizzy.\n\nAlso, I have the feeling that jumping ship, on this economy, will lead me to lower wages and worse conditions.\n\nI don't know. I see other colleagues and they gleefuly engage on all this bullshit, but I feel that I can't keep up with the more \"extroverted\" types discussing that new abstract feature because I lost track of what a \"McGuffingRequestEngager\" is, and before I could ask, they have moved on to something different. What is worse, I feel like I don't give a fuck anymore, that I need to be handheld for most tasks because I don't remember that the McGuffingBO is used to hold orders not processed but also wishlist items. I don't remember when was the last time I could concentrate on something for more than 10 minutes, let alone \"being in the zone\" (our local development environments being awfully slow and hanging continuously doesn't help). I don't remember when was the last time I was confident on a task assigned to me. I don't remember when was the last time I gave a fuck about anything that happened in my company.\n\nSo yeah, besides going to therapy, which is something I'm going back shortly, what the fuck can I do. As I said, I'm on a short vacation to get some other type of shit done. I can't take more vacations shortly, and I need to turn around this and get my shit together, either to look something else or to start giving a shit at my current company.\n\nAny ideas?",

I'm hoping for a layoff after explaining the viability problem along with the reasoning why this evidence was not presented ages ago (I was basically requesting additional staff so there was time to investigate but the product owner kept wanting to expand his product out without addressing these issues).\n\nWhat I learned from all this is if the guy who hired you leaves one year after hiring you, the guy he works for leaves 6-8 months after, and then the company changes hands a year later, it might be a good idea to find another place to work.",

It's awful, especially seeing how my highs are ignored and are not enough, but my lows are always noticed and exemplified.\n\nBut when I can barely think of this shit because I'm excited with my actual life? Fuck me, these corporate drones can tell me anything they want, cry about my performance or speed or how the stupid deadline they should not have set in the first place failed -- anything.\n\nFinances is tough, though. If you're already spending most of what you earn (if not all or more), I can only hope you can sort this out quick and start interviewing. You don't even have to quit, but doing good at interviews and knowing you can quit this company and enjoy a honeymoon with some other does wonders.\n\nAs others said, try coasting if you can. Not sure if you can, though, because dealing with management expectations is probably even harder at your kind of seniority (\"hurr-durr do the thing, nobody else can, pleeeeeeeeease\").\n\nGet on some ARC Raiders.

      "text": "I’m a relatively new tech lead (2 years). I’ve been programming \\~14 years, professionally \\~9. On past projects I’ve led small teams successfully and had good relationships with clients and stakeholders.\n\nI’m now leading a new project for a large client. Team is 5 devs (including me). I’m running into a pattern with two developers that is making delivery and team coordination difficult:\n\n* Dev A (\\~10 YOE) is very strict about process and refuses to pick up work unless the task is documented to a certain standard, even for small changes. He debates most requests and decisions, and frequently escalates disagreements to our CDO instead of discussing with me first.\n* Dev B (\\~4 YOE) initially collaborated well, but over the last \\~5 months has started mirroring Dev A’s behavior: pushing back on many decisions and also escalating to the CDO/PM without raising concerns with me first.\n\nA few concrete examples:\n\n1. **CI quality push / fixing backlog** I added additional automated checks to CI and it surfaced \\~100 minor issues on main (small style/typing/lint-level problems). I asked the team to spend \\~1 hour at the start of the day to clear them so we can keep main clean.\n\n* Dev A refused.\n* Dev B said “ok” but didn’t participate, then complained to PM/CDO that it was wasted time. The rest of us cleared it in \\~1 hour.\n\n1. **TypeScript organization convention** Coming from C++ I suggested we keep types/interfaces in dedicated files separate from runtime logic (types-only file + logic file). I thought it was a small convention preference. Dev B escalated to the CDO saying this approach is “bad” and makes the codebase hard for others to understand. He didn’t raise it with me first.\n2. **Delivery crunch / visibility** During a sensitive delivery period, Dev A and Dev B didn’t push WIP or give end-of-day status updates. I needed to assemble a demo/status for the PM and asked for EOD updates + more frequent progress updates given the timeline. This also got escalated, and turned into a larger meeting with the CDO.\n3. **Constant debate slows delegation** With Dev A, nearly every task or PR comment becomes a debate, to the point where I’ve started avoiding delegating to him and end up fixing issues myself to keep momentum (not sustainable). This pattern was discussed in a recent team + CDO conversation, but I’m not confident it will change.\n\nWhat I’m trying to understand / get advice on:\n\n* Is this level of skip-level escalation and refusal to execute reasonable lead direction “normal,” or is it a clear team/process problem?\n* What expectations would you set around: (a) raising concerns with lead first, (b) escalation path, (c) definition of “task is ready,” (d) EOD updates / WIP pushing during crunch time?\n* What’s a good way to separate “healthy disagreement” from “non-collaboration” without turning it into a power struggle?\n* In your experience, what interventions work best: written working agreements, RACI/DRI clarity, stronger project management, one-on-ones, involving the manager early, or something else?\n* Also: if any of my requests sound like bad practice (CI push, types separation, update cadence), I’m open to being wrong — I’d appreciate direct feedback on what you’d change.\n\nContext: Dev A has \\~10 YOE, Dev B has \\~4. We’re under delivery pressure, and the repeated escalation is creating thrash and eroding trust.\n\nHow would you handle this, both short-term (deliver) and long-term (team norms)?",

He might change his own opinion based on the feedback from others and consistently makes excellent, collaborative and well-informed decisions.

Strategic silence is when your top contributors realize that their opinions are never heard or considered, their ideas are discarded.  Rather than being rewarded for their independent genius and experience, they will come to understand that they will be rewarded and succeed at the company by just doing whatever they are told. You will end up with a team of code monkeys who will never go out of their way to do anything proactive, and the top people who are actual geniuses will leave.\n\nEdit: my entire professional leadership life has been guided by WWPD: What would Picard do?",

(And the outcome is the team delivery, not the specific code written). You need to learn when you need to step in and pull tank and when to just step back and let people do it their way. It’s fine line to walk but that’s basically the entire job as a lead. \n\n(Eg your whole let’s reorganize the TS files because that’s how you were used to it in C++ land.

When do you think it's the best time to schedule it?\"\n\nNow the team may say \"It's not a top priority and we have other pressing matters to do at the moment\", or \"We think these checks are noisy and don't reflect the modern practices\", or \"We're not sure about the projected scope of the changes required, could we test it out first on individual components?\", etc. Compromise, suggestions, etc. \n\nYou should never launch a new feature cycle if one of the members of the team is against it.

When I change things, they often go through a review process, which required participation from the team. To avoid my juniors rubber stamping my changes assuming that I know better, I would often book some time to do mob reviews/knowledge sharing to explain my rationale.

Can you imagine my frustration?  \n\nIf something can be automatically linted, it can be automatically corrected.  Instead of forcing your team to manually fix these issues, you should have gotten team buy-in on an automatic, in-editor linter.\n\nFor the other issues, it's harder to tell who's the one being difficult. If you're just going in and changing someone's PRs because you don't agree with coding style or something, that's asshole behavior. But constantly debating your PR comments is also not good behavior.  You should have, early on, when this behavior first started, opened up a conversation about Code Review conventions that you could all agree to follow. There's lots of good writing about this online. Solicit your team's input about code review processes. Make them part of the decision making. Share some reading. Consider your own tone in the comments - are you telling people they're wrong, or starting a conversation about the best approach?  Etc. \n\nShort summary, you're leading a team, not driving a fleet of computers.  Treat it like a team. Don't force top down decisions unless you absolutely have to, and if you do have to, find ways to soften the impact (like introducing an automated linter instead of making them clean things up manually)",

No. It’s not. But you are new, and as others pointed out, you’re trying to do “little minor wins” when the aren’t the priority. Document the issues for when it is not crunch time. Encourage linting the files that are changed in a PR. Great that you got a bunch of developers to focus on busy work for your little win - but that’s not a win for your team, it’s a win for you. \n\n_Pick your battles._ it reads a lot like you are trying to establish yourself and not recognize you are (potentially) pissing people off instead of listening to them (we are forced to make assumptions here, in regards to your attitude/presentation, to your coworkers, so it’s absolutely possible I am off-base!)\n\n•\t⁠What expectations would you set around: (a) raising concerns with lead first, (b) escalation path, (c) definition of “task is ready,” (d) EOD updates / WIP pushing during crunch time?\n\nIf my lead is an asshole - I would have zero concern escalating. Especially if they argue minor technical fixes being a big enough priority of other work during a technical time crunch. Again - fix what you can on your current task (running a linter), or add it to the backlog for when your team has a slow period in the year to hit some maintenance (usually around the holidays, at most places I have worked, YMMV)\n\n•\t⁠What’s a good way to separate “healthy disagreement” from “non-collaboration” without turning it into a power struggle?\n\nThis goes back into not knowing you/your team. We have one-side of this. I’d take this to your CDO and ask them how you can improve yourself and your relationship, and seek some critical feedback, and NOT take it personal. Listen, reflect, plan with your CDO and/or team until you all are on the same page. \n\n\n•\t⁠In your experience, what interventions work best: written working agreements, RACI/DRI clarity, stronger project management, one-on-ones, involving the manager early, or something else?\n\nI’m torn on this, because it feels like “I’m trying to build my fiefdom” and less “trying to make business impact.” Again, the problem _may be you_ so throwing more meetings on a calendar will not make your devs more likely to understand you or not be irritated. \n\n•\t⁠Also: if any of my requests sound like bad practice (CI push, types separation, update cadence), I’m open to being wrong — I’d appreciate direct feedback on what you’d change.\n\nA lot of these are _nice to haves_ and also can be incredibly productive. BUT there is a time and a place, and you’re coming in late. You said “we knocked it off in an hour” without those two devs. That’s still a win, so instead of “I wanted EVERYONE to focus on this” you could’ve presented “I would like to hammer this out soon, if anyone had a moment” and get a group that is interested in doing the work. \n\nThen those devs that want to focus on their work? They can focus on it. Devs that want to focus on linting/maybe learning something? They can volunteer for it. \n\nMaybe you knock it out in an hour, maybe a couple days of one hour morning lint sessions. But this way, it’s less abrasive. \n\nI feel like you WANT to be a leader, but you’re still figuring out how to lead _the team you have._ You want them to be a certain way, instead of playing the hand you are dealt. Welcome to leadership - you need to work on compromise, communication, and recognizing that if people have a problem with you, it’s a learning moment for you to either “be more firm” or recognize “time and a place, focus on battles you can.”\n\nJust my two cents.",

That’s how you get buy in from people in general. I don’t like being just told what to do, especially without an explanation, and especially if I feel it’s the wrong choice.

Depending on priorities, I can totally see why pushback on refactoring might be valid, especially for small teams that need to move fast and meet deadlines. The senior dev might be going over your head because he thinks you are misaligned with what leadership wants. \n\nIt really feels like you emphasize \"polish\"/code quality and formalized processes, which are more standard at larger companies, whereas smaller startups/teams usually put more emphasis on getting things out. Of course, these are just my two cents",

If you're the team lead, do it in the 1-on-1 before meeting as a group.\n\nIf they don't push back during the 1-on-1 but push back during the group you call them out and get them to either get onboard or propose an alternative. Doing nothing is not an option.\n\nThat's your job to communicate. If you don't have devs willing to take on things as they come up, then you need a way of delegating fairly amongst the group. I usually establish a rotation for that kind of stuff. Your stand-up is a good opportunity to see who's got capacity and that's when new, ad-hoc sprint tasks need to be discussed and assigned.\n\nI am all for pushback on unfinished, unscoped, or work lacking designs where appropriate, but not every task needs to be perfectly fleshed out before it's started. The developer should be tasking on the ticket anyways otherwise it's just bashing their head against a wall. The development process should involve clarification and discussion with design/product where necessary.\n\nSometimes I'm given a task and I believe there is a better approach, if you work for a team that isn't receptive to feedback or responsive to suggestions, I would find a better team.

Also, you randomly time-boxed the exercise ? It sounds like you got in the way there more than you helped. You could have done this far better by saying \"Hey folks, I've managed to strap together a little CI improvement so next week I want us all to carve out the morning on Thursday to address some of the issues. Some of them you will think are non-issues, which is fine, I just want to adjust our linter to follow some more idiomatic practices. I'll of course be helping and I've already fixed some of the issues. It lives in this branch which I've made a draft PR of here if you want to see it before Thursday.\"  In my example, I don't assign work to anyone that I am not willing to do myself. I didn't say you have 60 minutes I said something more vague, the morning. If someone asked how long I would have said \"well, I'm willing to spend an hour or two on it, do what you are comfortable with\".    \n     \n - The organising types into files thing is small potatoes and from the sounds of it you did not pick up on the team resenting you for putting crap on their plate, so they just saw that as yet another fuck you / my way or the highway from the team lead. The fact that he didn't raise it with you in my head, it's probably your fault. You should be going out of your way to make yourself approachable and it doesn't sound like you have done much to win over the hearts and minds of your team members.\n     \n - Regarding the delivery crunch, you should have pushed back against that. EOD updates is unreasonable if there is already a standup. It can help but again, judging by the communication style you have put across here I would not be surprised if you messed that up.\n     \n - The constant debate from Dev A is just him rejecting you based on demonstrably poor leadership skills. You are acting more like a boss than a leader based on your examples.    \n    \n\nTo answer your questions:    \n     \n - Escalation to skip level is normal when the regular is failing    \n - The skip level should be the one instructing the team to raise it with you first    \n - Try to truly understand where people are coming from, and don't try and smear your way of doing things over everything. Find items that are provably upgrades from the status quo and do those first. Thank your team for their efforts, shower them with praise. Doing so will build up capital that you can expend when you find a hill worth dying on.    \n - If you are supposed to be managing these people, you should be having one to one meetings regularly, you should try to understand them as people first and from there you try to insert yourself as a mentor.    \n - Honestly none of the things you want to do are bad. You have just wrapped them in an attitude that does not jive with your team. You should have spent your first few months figuring out who those fiery personalities are, setting expectations with your manager, and then after you have some wins under your belt, you start influencing the direction.

I wrote a document with suggestions and arguments in about 2 hours, or a bit more. we had a short meeting that was cut short because he was busy. He told me to wait I ended up waiting for him for the rest of the day. The problem is that I couldn’t take any ticket from the backlog because they weren’t approved yet, and couldn’t work on anything . So I spent the day waiting or testing the platform to report bugs. ( I’m not a QA, but I hate doing nothing ) If i was monitored, I wouldn’t be paid, even though this wasn’t my fault and this is not an hourly job.\n\nif you’ve worked enough in this field, you know there are days where you spend most of it waiting for a PM to approve tickets, QA to finish testing, a ticket to be added to the backlog, in meetings or actually doing research on how to use a third party API in reddit but for a non tech person reddit , google seem like you are not actually working\n\ni actually have experienced monitored work before. In my first job, I was paid only for the hours I spent in VS Code. If I was on Google, or anything else ( even Stackoverflow ) , I was considered not working because the person monitoring wasn’t a tech person ( I stayed in that job mainly because I’m from Algeria, a third-world country, and the company was based in Saudi Arabia. The pay was in dollars, so even though it wasnt fair, I was still earning more than the average salary in my country )",

      "text": "Context: we are a WordPress development agency. We build WordPress websites for clients, nothing special.\n\nYesterday, we had a presentation covering all changes being made for 2026. As of this year, we are mandated to use Cursor. Not just that, they also introduced a Figma + Cursor workflow demo and expect us to adopt this workflow as soon as possible. They forecasted that we would be able to cut development cost in half. \n\nEvery single person in the room was on board, except for me. I rarely use AI, apart from maybe writing simple, pure functions, or debugging stuff I don't really care about and just need a pragmatic solution for. Personally, I don't see using AI as something necessarily beneficial. It has its uses, but I just see it as a different way of writing code, which is only 10% of my job. This new workflow however, is really something else. I don't even know what to think about it.\n\nOn the one hand, I hate it. It goes against everything I stand for and everything I think is critical for writing quality software. But on the other hand, we're not *really* writing software, we're just building crappy websites. I'm the only one in my team who is actually an experienced programmer with a passion for it. I do open source in my free time, just not as a profession (mainly because writing good software is generally not important to businesses).\n\nFor this reason, I'm starting to think this way of working might actually be (economically) viable for the company. The Figma demo showed one of our developers building a section of a website in 3 minutes, something that takes an average dev about 4 hours. Yes, it will probably break and be a nightmare to maintain, but I feel the time saved might *actually* make it worthwhile, because our websites really are very simple.\n\nSafe to say, I'm leaving this place as soon as I find something. Pay is good though. I'm just wondering if somebody else is using this exact workflow and can give me some insight on how this will most likely unfold in the long run. I'm genuinely curious, because I believe it might work as much as I don't.",

It's also not clear that time-to-PR is the right thing to measure. After all, you might have a very large project where the total is not the sum of its parts. It could be more, it could be less. But tickets could just be LOC all over again. Depends a lot on the project, and there's a lot of subjectivity involved.\n\nNow of course, I don't want to be moving the goalposts to some unachievable level of expertise, that wouldn't be fair. But I'm also not sure what experimental design would satisfy me, so might as well be honest about that.\n\nYou also gotta ask whether you it is even reasonable to expect a speedup. How many of these 16 RCT devs were actually proficient with the new tools before starting to use them? I wouldn't expect someone new to the tool to immediately see gains.\n\nFor now, I've only got personal experience to go by, from a variety of devs. AI is great for taking the mental load off.

Very smart guy, but when stressed he gets angry and often lashes out by being overly critical, nitpicking, and bitching about coworkers.  He expects others to \"just know\" things they could not possibly have known and to remember everything they've ever been told.\n\nMost mornings I come in to 5-10 Slack messages on a variety of topics.  Some are actually important.  Others are pointing out some super minor thing which could've been done better.  It's as if he has no ability to decide *not* to point out some minor flaw or sub-optimal code when it doesn't matter.  I then get more of these messages throughout the day.\n\nFor example, he recently chatted me complaining that a coworker had refactored something to `if (x > y || x === y)`, complaining that they could've just done `if (x >= y)`.  This is of course true, but in my opinion it warrants zero attention.  If it bothers you that much, just clean it up later.\n\nHe just can't help but get in jabs and snark at every opportunity.  It's much worse when he's stressed, and that is often.  I think he has a need to prove how smart he is despite being like fifty years old.  He is important to the company.  If he weren't, I think he might've been let go a long time ago.\n\n**How do you guys deal with someone like this?**  I don't want to make waves, but this guy is negatively affecting my quality of life and enjoyment of the job.  I realize this isn't strictly related to software engineering, but I imagine this isn't exactly uncommon in our field.

I kept sending those things to the people who did engage and stopped sending them to the ones who didn't.\n\nYears later I finally noticed the pattern of people getting weirdly not responsive and bosses criticizing my demeanor and made the connection, but too late for my reputation and relationships.\n\nWhat would have helped me is someone pulling me aside and explaining that no matter how I felt about it or what I meant by it, the way people perceive it is as you describe. It's unwelcome negativity that they don't want to engage with. Finding ways to channel those thoughts and turn them into something people want to hear is the best way forward from an office politics perspective. If they can't be reached on that or say they don't care then they aren't ready to learn (and may never be).",

That seems like my boss's job.\n\neh, I mean. It's your ears. What he's complaining about doesn't seem integral to the company or anyone's job function or anything actually getting done, he's using you as a vent-box. Worse, a vent-box for inconsequential nitpicking. \n\nYou don't have to tolerate that and it is entirely your place to put your foot down and say (in nicer words, probably) that this is negatively affecting you and you need space. \n\nAnd if that doesn't work... then it is very much your boss's problem if you are leaving this job due to the negative nancy. Maybe the company will learn (or maybe not) if it loses several engineers in a row and holds onto the important-but-tough-to-tolerate human. Personally I have seen at least one instance where someone who completely tanked team morale with lack of empathy coupled with negative charisma was let go, it's a possibility.\n\nYou have infinite patience, seems. I would have stopped responding a long time ago and \"Any opinion on this?\" would've gotten a flat \"no\" a couple times, followed by \"no, I am ambivalent, go away\" (nicer words, but same sentiment).",

Let's address these issues at a later time\" then immediately disengage.\n\nI have people like this in my family: the emotion, the fear and feeling of losing control, then the lashing out at whoever around them they think will take it. It's toxic, but you can't fight back like most bullying: you need to stay calm, not get give them the reaction they are looking, and disengage when you risk elevating. When you engage emotionally, or fire back that brilliant zinger you could only have thought of 5 mins later, it gives them the justification that rewards the behavior: \"see? this is a problem\" and continues the loop.\n\nYou never, ever, want to let an idiot drag you into the mud. They beat you with experience and then you're covered in mud. For instance, if you get 5 slack message when you turn on slack, only respond to the ones you actually need to respond to. Let the unimportant ones go without a response.\n\nFinally, and this is the trickiest/hardest thing, you need to consider bringing in a manager to curtail the worst of the behavior. Document instances where your co-worker is making people uncomfortable, where they are acting in a way that goes against team interests, when they are degrading teammates to multiple people, et cetera. Then, bring it up softly with a manager in a 1v1, \"the project is going well, but I'm having difficulties dealing with X, I was wondering if you could help me navigate the situation\". If/when they bite, hit 'em with the receipts, but frame it as \"I'm having difficulty dealing with this, here's what I did, what do you think?\".\n\nBringing problems to management works best not as a complaint, but when it's a problem that threatens the productivity or good management of the team only they can solve.\n\nFinally, if you have the instinct to \"fix this guy\", my experience with that is very, very poor. This is an issue of emotional processing, regulation, and impulse. That's a therapy \"examine your life\" and \"learn coping strategies\", but it's also way outside the corporate bounds for a teammate. **Treat them like they'll never change, contain the blast radius, and build the case for management to solve.**",

I think software development culture can be a bit emotionally mute at times, or attracts those sorts of personalities (you can see it in this comment section even), but someone being a snarky asshole, even if they're a correct asshole, is just pain miserable to deal with. It's not necessarily to create the change they want, and it has serious morale cost.\n\nI can tell you how I usually handle this OP. This assumes the individual is very snarky, talking bad about other devs to me regularly, **they have real power while I am disposable**, and most importantly **I absolutely do not trust them with a direct adult conversation on it**. Oh, and also I feel like I've built up some rapport/good will with this person. These are the types of things I'd say to them, usually using humor/suggestion to indirectly say something to them:  \n  \n**1)** If I think I can sort of \"solve their problem\" and thus get them to shut up about it, I will half suggest it innocently, while validating their frustrations. Ex:\n\n*\"You ever thought about using a linter? We had one at another job, it'd often flag stuff like this, could save us the headache\".* Maybe something else like *\"I know we use contractors so it feels like we can't trust their code either... seriously, this is what linters are made for, haha.\"*\n\nBonus points if you act unsure about it, they'll convince themselves it was their idea to actually lock it in, which will make them more likely to go for it.\n\n**2)** If I don't like the disrespectful way they're talking about our mutual coworkers, especially behind their back:\n\n*\"What's this? Another roasting of \\[coworker\\]'s code for breakfast?* 👀*sometimes I wonder who you go to about my mistakes\"*  (Gameplan: Imply that I see him fundamentally as someone who talks crap about people behind their backs)\n\n*\"Lol I feel like the editor to your pull request feedback\"* (a) You should be putting these in a PR, not to me. b) You do this a lot and I'm calling out the pattern.)\n\n*\"Maybe we should be calling this stuff out in the dev channel? It could be useful feedback for the other devs to see\"* (Gameplan: trick him into openly showing his hostility to where upper management can see it and turn others against him. Or get him to basically admit he's not willing to say things like this in front of others because he knows he's being a jerk)\n\n**3)** I find it annoying/tiring:  \nVery limited responses/disengage.

Doesn't scale, can't maintain, doesn't do xyz, etc.\n\n3. rather than fix the issue (if there even is one), a proposal is made to create a new in-house version. Sprinkle in buzzwords like \"design for xyz from the ground up\" or whatever\n\n4. create a silly MVP in record time\n\n5. realize you over-promised and under-delivered when \"everything else\" is not going in the same velocity as the silly MVP. Hire more goons. The goon in step 2 gets promoted\n\n6a. after throwing more money / devs at the problem, we reach \"maturity\" where we have the same useability as before and we get back to step 2.\n\n6b: project gets transferred to a different manager, also interested in empire building by increasing ops. This manager protects this pos project because it guarantees headcount.\n\nEveryone knows this and everyone follows along. Is it like this for other folks in larger tech companies?",

However, I realize I’m new here and no one really knows me yet. Also I want the senior engineers to drive and own this. \n\nThe current implementation of one of these apps uses a rather niche set of tech. One of the desired goals is to get off that and onto something more widely supported. Another is to address a bunch of shortcomings in logic and observability, consolidate logic spread across several applications. \n\nIn some initial talks with the most knowledgeable senior engineer, they wanted to keep using that stack so that development could go faster, by ostensibly being able to reuse already developed code. This team has been under a lot of pressure to do a lot of things fast, so I get that, but those shortcomings got in there by not being thoughtful about adding features.\n\n  \nSo all this is set up to get some advice on how to convince the team to move to a more supported platform. It will take longer, but if there is an opportunity to improve things, why stick with an already subpar experience?",

It's a mental model from writer G.K. Chesterton, emphasizing that hasty reform without understanding the why behind existing structures can lead to worse outcomes, urging reformers to first discover the original logic before suggesting removal.\n\nDespite the hit or miss mature, this is why I follow this sub. I'm not a stodgy luddite dinosaur, but it is exhausting trying to explain 90% of the problem space, and 90% of the solution space, to someone who is in the process of learning both, while their learning style consists of demanding to switch to the shiny new thing.\n\n(PS: Use postgres, avoid distributed systems, build deterministic software until you can't, prefer libraries over frameworks, when necessary use frameworks that are proven, and use libraries and frameworks in the ways that are intended and solidified by popularity.)",

Might have to keep someone dedicated to the old stack for maintenance until you work something out on a soft migration path.\n\nI've done something similar in the past, and worked out the average on-boarding time of new hires for the existing stack vs the new. Looked at the features implemented vs the basics available in newer stacks. Money talks, so it's just a matter of what the money looks like and where it is being wasted.\n\nWhether you're getting the stacks swapped or not, there's usually lots of room for automation and CI/CD. If done right, that can grant a ton of relief by itself in both expenditure and developer satisfaction.

Switching tech stacks is no small thing and involves throwing lots of expertise of the current team out the window potentially (even if in isolation it would make sense to switch, the context here means a huge con is that all the devs become suddenly completely inexperienced in the new tech)\n\n> In some initial talks with the most knowledgeable senior engineer, they wanted to keep using that stack so that development could go faster, by ostensibly being able to reuse already developed code. This team has been under a lot of pressure to do a lot of things fast, so I get that, but those shortcomings got in there by not being thoughtful about adding features.\n\nThat sounds like a good starting point to convince them if switching stacks is really the correct move. Show, don't tell, that the new tech stack would allow them to keep doing that. Maybe see if there's a way to slowly convert it (with language bindings, IPC, whatever it's hard to say from the lack of details) and demonstrate why and how it's better. Identify their pain points they're having *now*, and show how this would improve after the switch.\n\n> I realize I’m new here and no one really knows me yet\n\nThen I'd say get them to know you as a doer that shows them better ways (if it truly is better), and does not just tell.",

However, it comes with one major challenge: you have no power. You are not a manager, you can't dictate what a team should do. If the team lead says no, then the team is not going to follow you. It is something that many people moving beyond the senior engineer don't fully appreciate. \"But, but, I'm even more senior now?\" - \"Sure, but you have no power.\"\n\nYour impact is achieved through influencing. There are broadly two ways you can achieve this:\n\nThe first one is to gain respect. You actually deliver substantial value, contribute impactful ideas and change, make things better, tackle low hanging fruits, roll up your sleeves and ship some code together with a team, etc. You need to build credibility, before people will accept you as a leader. \n\nOr, you can go complain to the VP or CTO, play the political game, convince them that your idea is the right one. They may (or may not) accept it and then mandate it and tell everyone to effin do it what you are saying. \n\nBut landing a new role in a new company and just assuming that people will do what you tell them because you says so (and who says that you are not the one that is wrong?), that is going to burn you out. \n\nAs a side note: many people have died on the hill of tech stack changes and rewrites. Make sure you learn the lessons from decades of software engineering. Worst thing you can do as a new senior joiner, is spending 9 months rewriting a tech stack, and the team has no business value to show for (i.e. shipping a new revenue generating thing), to (from the business point of view) end up in the same place as you were before.

Learn about what they are doing and why and build up examples of where things went wrong and how they could be different.  \n\nAlso go to the senior engineers and start making your case.  Don’t tell them they are wrong, but explain what change you want to bring about and what the value would be.  Then use examples like ‘if it was like this that situation from last week would have been different and here’s why’.  Encourage them to feed back why they support their architecture or see if they can suggest changes to your ideas that will make them more acceptable.  I find tech people are a lot more likely to buy into an architecture they had a hand in creating.\n\nFor existing projects your senior engineer might be right though!  I find that it’s very often better to stick with what you have and iterate rather than starting again.  What happened for me is when things get restarted they fix the pain points quickly but then run into problems re-doing all the bits of the old solution which were quietly working well and there are normally a lot more bits working well than you think!",

Like, the dev team was inflated by 80% and the old tech stack was frozen except for bug fixes, so there was more dev resource *and* less work coming through.  It took about two years, and extended beyond my time there (I was one of the drafted-in engineers to expand capacity).  Fortunately the business was privately owned, understanding and had a high revenue burst to support this as well as a market glut of developers - it was basically a perfect storm.\n\nIf your team's already being pushed to get things done \"fast\" (IE, not necessarily with code quality as top priority) and it's resulting in bad code, then adding renovation to the workload is *not* going to improve things.  It's not going to make you popular either.  You might say you aren't there for a popularity contest but that's bravado - unless you have illicit photography or a firearm, \"popularity\" goes with \"political capital\".\n\nYou can probably get it done if it's really important, but you *have* to have to resource to get it done, at the time it's getting done.  Changing codebase is way too big a revolution to just man-mode through.  *Especially* if the team is already strained with high expectations.  I don't think the team is the people you need to be convincing; you need to be negotiating an increase in manpower if you're serious.",

How it plays out depends heavily on the culture at the company and the actual expectations of your role.\n\nFor example, maybe they said \"try to get people to modernize\" but if it doesn't happen that's okay. In that environment you should focus on helping teams with whatever they're doing and building credibility with them. That's how you gain influence. Not technical arguments.\n\nYou can do some proofs of concept yourself that show how the new stack can provide value. Get people excited about the new capabilities. Then after all of that setup, work directly with whoever sets priorities and schedules to make room for modernization projects. Have them erase any perception that doing this work is in conflict with the team's priorities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's in your quarterly goals to see progress on modernizing the stack. And your performance is going to be evaluated based on that. In that environment, you need to learn to make your goals visible and telegraph to people that you're going to make these things happen. You don't ask. You just give them lots of room to get used to the idea and lots of help to prepare for it.\n\nYou still need to do all of the work of gaining credibility by helping with whatever the team is doing. That's a given in any scenario. But in this case it helps to counteract the bad taste that comes with telling them that you have authority to put things on their priority list.\n\nLearning how to navigate this isn't easy. Sometimes it will result in rising tensions. It helps if your manager backs you up. It really helps to make sure you are surfacing any wins from making the necessary changes. Maybe systems are easier to maintain. A certain project took way less time because the team was able to use the modern stack. Some incidents were quickly resolved due to the improved observability. Try not to be obnoxious, but be very loud with your wins so people don't just question whether any of it matters.",

      "text": "I (6 YOE) have joined a company which has recently decided to bring some software development in-house, myself and three others. They also have a R&D team which includes one person who has been writing Python code, including some tools that have made it into production. Please understand that I have nothing against this person when I say that it is impressive how bad their code is considering they have access to ChatGPT. The first tool of theirs that I refactored had whole chunks of code that were never actually executed (unbeknownst to them) and I would place it at a level below a junior dev, more someone who has just started learning Python.\n\nRefactoring their code has been super time consuming, because it involves a full re-write. To try and minimise how painful this is, I have tried to implement some standards that I have asked them to stick to for new projects. Originally these were\n\n1. Use GitLab for version control.  \n\n2. Use our repository templates which enforce ruff chucks (we’re using uv) and a minimum pytest coverage of 70%.\n\nFor context, they have some GitHub experience but only pushing to a repository, not anything to do with branches and code reviews. I have created documents with the exact commands and explanations for concepts such as branching plus taken them through it on multiple calls. \n\nAnyway, to cut a long story short, they continue to develop code locally to extremely poor standards. I have escalated this up to the CTO who is completely on my side, and he has spoken to this R&D person’s manager. Unfortunately, their manager wasn’t happy we were brought in as he feels like we’re stepping on his toes, so he does not enforce the new standards at all. \n\nMy question is, has anyone got any advice at all about how I can win these people over? I am very willing to put in the time to up-skill people, but it is just flat out resistance at every turn. The worst bit is in a call they agree with me, but then they don’t do anything. \n\nApologies slight rant but really would love suggestions. ",

Software engineers do software engineering things. Writing, deploying, maintaining, and being responsible for production systems is a software engineering thing, not an R&D thing.\n\nWhen marking out boundaries, it's very tempting to focus only on the harm others are doing, but you cannot do this. You need to start this conversation by sitting with your manager and possibly the CTO and developing a full understanding of the value of R&D to the org, and in particular the value that this individual brings. Because there's already been friction, you need to lay this on pretty thick. (I mean, in all likelihood, this person actually is invaluable to the business, otherwise they wouldn't be paying him and giving him this kind of leeway in the first place.)\n\nThe goal here is not to limit what any individual or department can do, it's to maximize what the org as a whole can do, and that begins by understanding what everyone's bringing to the table and how best to leverage it. Frankly, this is work your manager and CTO should be doing, but since they seem unable to manage it, you can get the ball rolling.\n\nIn this conversation, you need to explain your own team's value as well, and how you need ownership of your area of responsibility just as R&D requires ownership of the realm they play in. That means you need to control production quality if you're responsible for it. If you can't do that, then you cannot own it either, and you're unwilling to carry the pager for any part of the system R&D is pushing code to. Again, this isn't territorial pissings, you're justifying this by pointing out that it's literally your job description and expertise to maintain these systems, and the org shouldn't *want* R&D doing this work.\n\nAgain, you can't focus the discussion entirely on what's wrong, but you need to also create a happy path. Explain how things should ideally work. Maybe you create a playground env where R&D can do whatever they want and once they've proven out a concept, they can push requirements into your dev process where you'll write code, make sure it's fully tested, deployed in a standard way, etc.\n\nClearly, R&D is hearing your objection as unreasonable, which means they think you are trying to limit what they can do, or you are trying to do their job yourself. You have to really listen to these objections and take them seriously so you can figure out where the disconnect is and assuage those fears. You need to work with them to understand how your teams can work together so you're both able to do your jobs within your own areas and everyone is clear on what the boundaries are and happy with it.",

          "text": "There are three aspects to a promotion in a healthy organization.\n\n1. Does the employee demonstrate sustained performance against the job ladder at the next level? The purpose of this is to make sure that we don't promote someone on the basis of a unusually strong performance and then discover that they cannot sustain that. Common organizational failures around this include the lack of a published and consistently used job ladder, and turning the sustained performance into a \"time in grade\" requirement, rather than \"do we think we'll have to manage someone out for not performing at the promoted level\".\n\n2. Is there a business need for someone at that level on this team? Often, this is handled with the first question (after all, how were they performing at L+1 if there wasn't a need for it), but sometimes the project that demonstrated their actual performance level was a one off and there won't be a sustained need. Common organizational failures here revolve around not planning to help the employee move to a team where their skills are needed. Common management failure here involves not telling someone that their growth is capped on this team, even if that means they need to leave the company.\n\n3. Promotion budgets. There is after all, a limited pool of money, so sometimes the question turns into \"who cleared the bar by the largest margin\". The biggest organizational failure I've seen involves trying to hide this fact and blaming the employee, and the second biggest is going by \"time in grade\" rather than by performance.\n\nNote that none of these involve how many years of experience someone has. If they did, we could avoid all sorts of work by just going by that number. If people have that expectation, it needs to be something they are taught isn't real. If by some chance it is real in the organization, you should be interviewing around to get out.\n\nThe best time to have had these conversations was at last year's performance review cycle. The next best time is now. And again, it isn't \"Do this and get promoted\", because that isn't in your power. It is \"you need to clearly demonstrate these ladder attributes for L+1, let's sit down and see which ones we can show that you have met, and which ones we still need to show you can do\".",

As a result of the slow build time, my team has their own solution file that loads only 200 of the roughly 700 projects, allowing us to use already-built dlls for the other projects and as such speeding up the process locally (i.e. around 5 minutes of building).\n\nThe big issue lies in the fact that it's so hard to switch branches due to the cached dlls, meaning we have to run a sync process that downloads the most recent version of one of our 3 main branches. There's usually something getting stuck in cache and whatnot, meaning it can take between 30 to 60 minutes to switch a branch and work on something else.\n\nHow do you or would you handle this, knowing it can happen 2-3 times per day (depending on the day)?\n\n  \nP.S. for those that read: I'm not interested in speeding up the building process. I'm way too new, it's way too complicated, there are way too many people working on devex as a daily job. I will not be able to find any magical solution that fixes our buildtime after literal man-years have been spent on it.",

On Windows usually the load path is relative first. But if there are system paths it is using then most apps shouldnt be using them anymore and there are approaches to make it less \"system\" bound (e.g. use registration free COM).\n\nBut again, not knowing the nature of the app, it is easier said than done.",

Regardless of succeeding or failing I’ve always further developed my skills to my own benefit.\n\nMy biggest thought on this whole thing, but likely too large to tackle to start with;\n - it sounds like the build server always builds all 700 projects\n - it sounds like the caching solution is not reliable\n - reducing the number of projects building significantly improves build time\n - with any change you’re likely not impacting all 700 projects\n - make the caching solution fully reliable\n - write a script which calculates the dependency graph based on a given change set\n - write a script that uses cached builds for projects that are not changing and not dependent on a project which is changing\n\nFrom learnings taken improving things locally or falling to improve things (but learning), I’d draft up my ideas for improvements (like above) and present them to management to either get the DevEx team to experiment with or get the OK to try myself (since this is not a small job).\n\nMy second advice, if you really don’t want to, is there must be other frustrating things than the build process. Tackle those instead. Always try and fix all the frustrating parts of your job :)",

Try to schedule the switches before/during meetings and over lunch. \n\nHave multiple workspaces/trees and switch between the trees instead of branches. This will save you a cache invalidation or two a day. Our workspaces are 500-800GB, so don't be telling me that you can't fit more than one workspace.\n\nLastly, \n\n> I will not be able to find any magical solution that fixes our build time after literal manners have been spent on it.\n\nI beg to differ. On a previous project, we had a dev and build team plus a platform team that was 20+ people. It used an in house build system with custom everything. I believed the same thing until I started profiling the builds. I spent about a week on minor improvements here and there, and I brought our single file incremental build changes down from 1 minute to sub 5 seconds for the area my team worked on, and by doing the same thing in more places I brought the wall clock build time of the project down by 25%\n\nThe existing engineers are used to it. The devex teams won’t touch project structure, dependencies, application code, interfaces etc. One change to a poorly coupled interface can be more effective than enabling build caching.",

I've been promised another twice, and both times my bosses boss either quit or moved to another part of the org.\n\n\nThen I changed teams to avoid having to write Java and I've apparently been assigned to the \"I never promote anyone\" manager. And it's not like they're telling me the work isn't good enough or anything like that, in fact the past two years they secured me $35k in additional bonuses (on top of the 10%/yr we are mostly guaranteed).\n\n\nBut with the pandemic and oh boy the current administration even the fortune 400 company I work for is pretty afraid to increase costs. So now even fewer promotions are given. And the scope of my responsibilities has increased of course, I'm effectively working 2 levels above my pay grade. But I did at least leverage that to offload some responsibility to the more personable developers so I can focus less on hunting people down for meetings and more on the technicals. \n\n\nThe job is too good to give up though. This is the only \"unlimited vacation\" place I've seen that actually honors that, I've been able to take ~6 weeks per year plus the odd day here and there. Permanent work from home, too, since they sold the office space in the state I live in. I've continued to make it clear that it feels pointless to deliver more than I'm expected if I'm never going to either see a real push from my manager to promote me or at least tell me why he isn't. ",

The responsibilities change, but generally speaking, it means that I tend to be assigned to a specific team, but the expectation is that I’m doing IC work that’s broader than the scope of that team. I help with team projects… but I also step out and take a few weeks (or months) to do something to improve things for all engineers at my company. This type of role is usually something that appears at larger companies, because smaller companies don’t need random engineers who wander around making things better.\n\nThere’s a great “4 archetypes of staff Eng” article floating around, and the four are: Tech Lead, Architect, Solver, Right Hand. I’ve done all four, but typically, I tend to be most comfortable as a Solver/Architect — someone who sees arbitrarily large problems that no one else is/can work on, that fall in the gaps between teams. I find them, document them, make the case for why we should solve them, and then get other ICs or even teams moving as I need so that I can solve them.\n\nThere’s “senior” staff engineers, and I have generally realized that I’m not interested in that promotion. The companies I’ve worked at, that step tends to be a much bigger jump into leadership and soft touch, and away from being an IC. I pursued it pretty hard for a few years, but spending time working as a Right Hand / Lead Eng for an org with 50 engineers showed me that I _can_ do it, but don’t really find it very satisfying. I like to stay where the expectation is that I’m coding, but also that I’m doing my own thing.",

It is true that if you want to progress beyond that, you have a narrower selection of companies to work at. \n\nAs a reminder “Senior” means different levels at different companies so let me clarify - I mean someone who is a google L5 equivalent (or comparable). \n\nThis is someone capable and in charge of scoping a project, choosing tech stack, delegating to mid levels and juniors as needed (if they are even available) and ensuring timely completion of a project to reasonable technical standards taking the timeline into account.\n\nTo go beyond this, smaller companies transition immediately into executive roles because that’s just how the business functions. Some get into Director roles, VP of engineering etc. \n\nCompanies that are larger and are primarily product focused often do have IC ladders that aren’t the management track of manager, senior manager, director, VP etc. \n\nYou as an individual have to be proactively thinking and planning your career if you want to progress beyond Senior dev. and what you want that to look like. For many places, that level is terminal and you never need to promote beyond that again and won’t be expected to. You can just perform at level and won’t get laid off for that.",
